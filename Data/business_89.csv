I think we paid about $100\/night and had a beautiful suite. The room was very nice, the bathroom had awesome features (flat screen tv in the huge mirror, huge glass partitions between the shower and toilet and rest of bathroom) and the jacuzzi bath tub kicked butt. The robes they have inside the room are probably the most comfortable I've ever worn. The whole place was just top-notch, especially for the price. We had the feeling of luxury the entire time.

Lots of gold colored everything in and outside the hotel which adds to the visual appeal of the hotel. When you go out to the pool and it's sunny you're blinded by gold lol. 

It's also north-centrally located off the Strip, near the Wynn, and right across the street from Fashion Show Mall. Easy access getting in and out of the hotel but valet only.

This is a hotel only so no casino floor or anything to gamble. I actually liked this since it gives you a nice break from all the hustle and bustle of smokers and slot machines.

They have: large lobby with a bar, a restaurant, fitness room, pool and a pool-side eatery. I think they had a spa too but we missed that.

We had dinner at the restaurant and it was very good. I'd recommend the steak.",1,0,1

The hotel, and the rooms, are beautiful. It's described as ""off the strip"", but it's not far.  It was a 5 minute walk or so to the Wynn, and probably 10-15  to the Palazzo or Venitian.  Where it is right across from, however, is the Fashion Show Mall, which may or may not be a plus.  

What is a plus to me, maybe not to others, is the fact that this hotel doesn't have a casino.  This property was a failed condominium project that almost went under and was converted to a hotel when the real estate market dropped after 2007.  It has a small pool area, a so-so spa, a nice fitness center, a tiny bar, and a small restaurant.  

The rooms, as mentioned, are gorgeous, and the bathrooms are huge. (I was expecting a tacky gold gilding and mirrors look from Trump).  Definitely a location to relax at while you're in the room, and cab or hoof it when you want to go out on the town.

Donald, you're hired.",3,2,2

The check in process was great and our two year old even got a ""trump kiddy bag"". It had a coloring book and some crayons. Anyway, when we first walked into the room it was very spacious and as clean as a hotel room can be- I guess. The bathroom had some mildew on the edges and the doorway edges were worn because of the water that spills from the shower. The bathroom accessories were very worn and the lotion had already been used. The room offers a small Keurig for coffee and it had a used k-cup left in it. The closets were very dusty at the bottom. We had plenty of space to set up our pack and play and the view was great. Day two we picked up this great bottle of wine what do ya know- we needed a wine opener. I called the front desk to request one and the lady said she would have it sent right up. We never got it- good thing we never needed anything else. Okay so the second evening room service came in and everything looked good. I always keep everything very organized even when away from home, so housekeeper work is very routine when it comes to our room at hotels. Anyway, upon going to bed that night after a very long day I rest my head down and my pillow smelled awful! I mean I can't stand the smell of scalp on pillows at all, but this wasn't just dirty it was worse- I think this smell would be what the head of a bum who has not showered in forever would smell like. I set that pillow off to the side and got another- it was stinky as well. Third time is a charm. Finally, bed time. For the most part this hotel is decent, I mean it definitely is not a dump, but I have stayed at a holiday inn better than this. It needs a facelift, but it looks like many of the hotels in Vegas do. Next time we will spend more at a different hotel and hopefully it will be worth it.",1,0,0

For the people who are complaining that there isn't a casino - did you do ANY research on the hotel when you booked the place? Hell, even Hotwire lists that it's a resort, not a casino. We really enjoyed not having to walk through the smokey casinos to get to our room. The Trump was immaculate - so clean and smelled so fresh. 

The Saturday we opted for a cabana rental which was so cheap. We paid $150 for the entire day and that included an air conditioned cabana with a fridge full of water and sodas, our own daybed outside of the cabana and a waitress. The staff was really good and we always had a drink in hand. It was well worth the price, especially considering just how expensive other cabana rentals are at other hotels. 

All in all, we think we found a great gem. It's a little off strip, close to the mall and they have a shuttle that can take\/pick-up to Wynn and Caesars. I think we will for sure stay here again for the price, the service and the overall experience.",3,1,1

I personally did not check in but the lobby was very pretty. The marble flooring was beautiful but I have mixed feelings for the chandeliers. They are nice but old fashioned to me.

The Trump lounge area was a nice area to sit and have some snacks or drinks. A lot of comfy couches, tables and a bar. Again, the decor was tired to me...too much of a 70's or 80's feel mixed in with traditional furntiure. They should stick to one theme...get rid of those awful lighting fixtures.

We had a room on the 35 floor in a one bedroom suite...he swung an upgrade somehow. The room was nice and came with a small kitchen, including a full sized fridge, microwave and stove. No dishes or utensils came with the kitchen but you can call housekeeping to deliver everything you need.

The room came with 2 bathrooms. The living room bathroom had a shower only. I actually used this bathroom more than the other due to a strong head cold to steam myself when feeling sick. The master bathroom was very large with a nice, jetted soaking tub, a dual head shower and a separate closed off area for the toilet. I wasn't a fan of the sliding door for the bathroom though. 

The bedroom was well appointed and we took use of the dual wardrobes to hang our clothing. Not much drawer space but fine for us for the weekend. 

The living room had an L-shaped couch and a very large media built in unit. If you needed storage space, you'd have it in that thing.

The TV'S were horrendous....couldn't get a channel to work without freezing or getting those satellite lines. The channel selection was probably the worst I've seen in a hotel in a long time....probably only 20 channels available total. 

One lamp didn't work when we checked in, but I changed the light bulbs around on two lamps to make it work again.

The telephone in the living room did not work as well...we could only use that phone if we used the speaker phone.

We had room service for one night. I had the basil, tomato pizza (meh), SO had salmon (he didn't finish it I don't think) and the chips with guac. I give everything a 2 out of 5...I would have given 3 if the prices had matched the taste.

I liked how the hotel was smoke free and casino free. It made it much quieter and kind of a getaway in the hectic strip. Don't know if I was impressed enough to stay again.

Let's be honest here...I only booked because it was smoke free and Trump is taking a hit because he is so unlikable right now which drove the price down substantially. We basically got the room for a very discounted price. Next time, we'll prob book another hotel though.",1,0,0

The room is very spacious and the bathroom contains a huge jacuzzi tub.  Big shower and again lots of room in the bathroom.   Lots of towels which is a plus.

The bed and living room were very comfortable. Lots of plugs, robe, big screen TV, all of the usual items. 

Noise from the pool is mild.  The train is very loud. 

Room contains coffee maker, microwave, refrigerator and stove.  This is nice if you want to prepare food. 

The reason for 4 stars....the food. It is high priced and not good.  Dry salmon, chicken noodle soup tasted like leather with canned vegetables (awful,) watery sauces on every dish and eggs that were marginal.  I would avoid room service.  It should be amazing for the price and every meal was below average. 

The gym is open 24 hours...plus. They are missing a stair climber and other machines that Canyon Ranch (Venetian) has.    There is no staff on hand and water was unavailable.

The only downside is, let the hotel know when you check in, that you only want to run one deposit of $100. Otherwise you'll find out the hard way like I did, that the hotel charges a deposit fee for each day you stay there. That's $100 a day. That was the only thing about the hotel that pissed me off. Especially being on vacation and finding out you now have no money to spend... in Vegas... Maybe that's how Donald Trump is planning on fixing that deficit if people actually vote for him next election. We'll just bill the bastards to death.",0,3,0

We initially choose Trump from the great rate we got through our show's travel agency. 

There were many things we LOVED about the Trump. #1, it's a non-casino hotel which was very welcome after a long day of being inside the other hotels for the trade shows. No cigarette smoke or continual beeping of the slot machines. The smaller footprint of the property is another big perk. You can actually get from your room to the bar, pool, fitness facility or entrance in a few short minutes compared with over 15 minutes in other hotels. 

We also had great interactions with all employees of the hotel, from the front desk staff, the concierge, the valets, the server in the bar area and the assistant manager. They were are genuinely friendly and interested in what we needed assistance with.

What was not so great about the Trump was the mysteriously horrible housekeeping of our room. And I can't imagine it was just our room that was having virtually no housekeeping done during our stay. We were just one room of many within the hotel, our guess is that the housekeeping staff were either short staffed or lacked supervision to basic duties in each room. 

When we checked in we had 3 obvious lightbulbs burned out - and one seemed to have exploded with broken glass from the bulb on the counter underneath it and an electrical filament buzzing: 1 of only 2 lamps on the mirror in the bathroom. Hard to overlook. We also had only 2 hangers and our TV remotes didn't worked. When we went to hang the robe on the back of the door the hook fell off onto the floor. Ha! All not biggies, but combined it did require a call to housekeeping to get more hangers, new remote and lightbulbs replaced. 

Then on day #2 we returned to the room to discover that our room was only half cleaned. One of the three garbage cans were emptied, Our dirty dished in the kitchen were taken away, but not replaced and nothing was done in the bathroom at all - dirty glasses were still on sink, towels on floor, garbage can full. Again - we called housekeeping to get some glasses to use for the evening & morning.

Day #3 brought absolutely no housekeeping at all. We returned to the room at 3pm and the room hadn't been cleaned. 
We were trying to grab a quick catnap, but if housekeeping was coming by, we thought we'd wait. We called housekeeping, they apologized and said they'd be right up immediately. We took a book to the pool and 2 hours later returned to the room. Still no housekeeping. We needed towels, glasses, etc. Went down to the concierge, who called the manager on duty. He profusely apologized and gave us a bar credit. We only had a single night remaining, so that was the end of that. But all in all, for a hotel like the Trump to not be able to make up a room with basic necessities just seemed strange.

Without this experience we would have given this hotel 5 stars as the staff we interacted with were excellent and we liked the layout of the hotel. We've frequently stayed at much lesser level hotels, and housekeeping always seems to be able to empty garbage cans, replace towels and bring in new water glasses. This was the Trump. Very wierd, we did laugh as in the scheme of things it wasn't a biggie but unsure if we would return.",0,0,0

Use priceline or hotwire and you'll be happy with the hotel. If you pay full-price you may wish you opted for a different hotel. 

It is definitely NOT ON THE STRIP. It is a short walk to the strip but a walk nonetheless. 

Parking is sometimes a pain so we chose to park in the mall parking directly across the street. No need to tip or wait for the valet. :)

There was a full kitchen, complete with an oven.  I guess you just never know when the urge to bake something will strike ;)  Anyway, there's a dining area, a living room with a large sectional sofa and a chair.  One side of the place had floor to ceiling windows.  One full ""guest bath"" (complete with a tub and shower) and then into the master suite.  Ahhhhhh so nice!  Big room, big bed, big bathroom, big windows, big mirrors!  BIG EVERYTHING!  It's like I stepped into the land of the fancy giants!  There was a tv in the mirror, but my favorite thing was the shower with dual shower heads.  F- YEAH!  I already miss it!   

The staff was also super nice and very accommodating.  We arrived at the crack of dawn and they found us a room so we could check in early.  Otherwise, we would have had about 6 hours before the typical check in time.

side note: This hotel does not have a casino and doesn't allow smoking, which didn't bother me at all but to some people it might.  

The pool is nice too, but it's filled with a more....ummmm ""distinguished"" crowd, which isn't surprising bc it's Trump's Hotel.  So, if you're looking for a fist pumping pool experience, this isn't the place for you.

The only odd part was the seating at the restaurant downstairs.  It's set up sort of like a living room with some bistro tables scattered about.  So, if you want to eat an awkward meal leaning over a coffee table, while sitting on the couch, this is the place.  We were lucky enough to snag one of the few tables though.  :)  

In short....a big yes!",2,1,1

Cons: Minor booboos, free shuttle, no doorman or taxi person

If i could, I'd actually give this hotel an extra .5 stars.  I booked this hotel through priceline and actually got ripped off, so I wouldn't recommend that.  BUT, I booked another night through bookit.com as a ""5 star mystery hotel"" and got a great deal!! 

The hotel is located slightly off the strip (a quick and easy walk, even in the cold and in heels), right across from Fashion Show Mall (Nordstrom and the ginormous Forever 21).  There is also a complimentary shuttle that takes you to Caesars Palace and Encore (which is pointless bc it is just down the street)...but I can't complain, it's free.  

The hotel is BEAUTIFUL!  Very glamorous and over the top with crystal chandeliers and gold accents...very Trump.    To top it off, the hotel smells like lotion and is quiet....It is completely non-smoking and non-gaming...a nice little retreat from all the chaos on the strip.  A downfall, though, is that there was no doorman at the front or person directing taxis\/traffic.  I think this should be standard for ALL 5 star hotels...especially anything with the Trump name.

Also...We were lucky to score a free upgrade!  Instead of a studio, we were upgraded to a 1 bedroom\/2 full bathroom suite.  The master bath is HUGE with a separate shower\/tub and vanity. I believe all rooms have a full kitchen, lounge area and dining table.  HOWEVER, there were minor problems in our room...No TV in the bathroom mirror (but the cables were still there) and 1 of our closet doors would not open.

For the second time in my LIFE, I had a hotel room to myself! Back in the day, at least 6 of us girls would pack into a room, and the fight was on to get into the bathroom at night when we were ready to hit the Strip!

I could gush on and on about this hotel, but other Yelpers have done it ably. The first thing I did when I opened the door and put my stuff down was start taking pictures, because that room was UNREAL. The whole setup that looked like an elegant home, the kitchen area with everything you could need for a bomb-ass party, and the bathroom. Oh, my, the bathroom. The jacuzzi tub was insanely big (which became somewhat comical when I climbed in after a few glasses of wine!). 

The television in the mirror...forget about it!  I'm one of those people that puts off getting ready because I can't bear to miss the last few moments of my show, or I'm waiting for the traffic report to come on, etc. A TV embedded in the mirror so that I can watch it while getting ready OR while relaxing in the tub? How am I supposed to return to my dinky condo in the Valley after having experienced this?!? 

And the bed, fantastic! And the plush robe I lounged around in while I waited for room service to bring me up one of the aforementioned glasses of wine! I felt like a superstar! Although, paying 18 bucks after all the charges and fees for a single glass brought me crashing down to earth. 

Cons: it's true about the ""Law & Order"" or ""CSI"" looking walk to the strip from this hotel. Spend the money on a cab, or catch the free shuttle service right in front and go over to TI from there. And I'm annoyed that it's now called ""TI"" and not Treasure Island. But I digress. 

There's only one little bar to get your ""drank"" on, which was odd. I personally loved that the place didn't have a casino (I was restless and bored at one point, so thank God or I would have gone down and thrown more money into Mr. Trump's pocket). 

One last gripe; what's with the daily ""resort fee""? I never did get a straight answer on what that includes. But since I didn't pay for the room I didn't gripe much. 

I would have posted all the pictures I took, but they somehow got erased from my camera. Figures.

On the negative side:  This hotel left me wondering if it was really a five star hotel. There are no robes in the room.  The pool closes at 5pm. When you press the room service button on the phone the front desk responds (leaving me feeling like the hotel is understaffed since this happened on more than one time). There is almost no cell service and the t.v barely works.  However, I give this hotel only one star for the poor location and lack of amenities in the hotel alone (there is only one lobby hotel that sells trump t-shirts).  This hotel requires you to take a taxi almost anywhere you are going In fact, even if you want to walk to the Wynn you realize that you have to walk on the street to do so since there are no side walks.  The hotel is quiet but too quiet really. You kinda feel like you thought that you were going to Vegas but ended up somewhere else instead. If you wanna go to Vegas to sit in your room for much of your stay (or take taxis everywhere you go...which gets expensive) this may be the place for you. However, if you wanna feel like you are in the action  than this not for you.  Plus, the shuttles between Wynn and Trump stop running at midnight during the week (wait....we are in Vegas still right?). This place may be ideal for a business traveler.  But for now...all that I can say is: Donald you're fired!  I would prefer to spend my money somewhere else.",4,0,0

I figured I would just put them in the freezer in the room but apparently at least the standard room it is a mini fridge without freezer so i couldnt do that. i went back minutes later to try and exchange the one ice cream bar I hadnt thrown out to show the lady and maybe get one further back in the freezer and could tell now upon closer inspection they were all on the verge of melting with the freezer temperature being set just barely at a freezing temperature. I ask the lady for a refund and she refused because i didnt have a receipt even though i had literally been there no more than 3 minutes ago.

I don't like smoky casinos and I did not miss the clanging and jangling machine noise that I try so hard to ignore in the other Strip casino hotels.  The Trump is right across the street from Nordstroms in Fashion Show mall and kitty corner to the Wynn, which is convenient for all the shopping and dining in which one may desire to partake during one's stay. 

All staff members with whom we interacted were super friendly and helpful.  Our king suite was on the 53rd floor and had a great view of the Strip and surrounding mountains.  The suite was immaculate and the bed was comfortable.  Bonus: it was pretty quiet that night, perhaps due to the lack of drunken gamblers stumbling back to their rooms after a night of debauchery.  :)

And the staff are expertly trained to make you feel special but not bombarded. In fact, it seemed like everyone was trying their darndest to avoid those 2 words...""You're Fired"". The D-man would be proud.

I booked a Studio room for $99\/nt (Travelzoo promo), but it was more like an apartment...with kitchen, huge bathroom with jacuzzi tub and big marble shower. Quite a steal! And my hair really liked the Trump Spa toiletries, too. Always a bonus.

You pay a $15 resort fee, but it includes free valet parking which is totally worth it. The fitness center is huge, which looks out onto the swanky pool area with the oh-so-inviting outdoor beds and chaises. 

We ate at the DJT Lounge 2 nights and still...no complaints. Our waitress was super-professional but friendly, and the tapas menu is pretty authentic...gazpacho was a fave. They have an awesome happy hour, which we didn't even know about until the bill came. Cha-ching!

It's geared towards business travelers, so during our stay the majority of the crowd was a bit more mature. Not that we're complaining though, as it was nice not to hear the ongoing 'Woos!' and 'Yeahs!' i'm used to hearing in other hotels.

Both the hotel itself and the rooms were very spacious and well appointed - I think it's definitely worthy of the 5 star designation at a very reasonable price. The pool wasn't crowded at all and the gym was pretty stacked for a hotel gym.

This hotel doesn't have a casino and dining options are very limited - although directly across the street is the fashion show mall which has plenty of food options.

There's also a free shuttle to\/from the Wynn and Caesars since it is on the far end of the strip.

The only downside, as I read in other reviewers, but chose to ignore regrettably, is the sound of the horn of a freight train that passes alongside the hotel every night. This only affects certain rooms with a 'City View', as we had friends also stay in a 'City View' room but they specifically asked for a 'quiet room' and they couldn't hear it. I looked out the window and the train tracks are pretty much across the street from the hotel. How bad was it? I got woken up once a night by the horn.

Would we stay here again? Definitely, considering it was much cheaper than the Vdara. However, next time we would likely stay in a room with a 'Strip View', or ask for a 'quiet room'.",2,1,0

The thing that is different, but I thought good about this hotel is that there is no casino, which to me only means a shorter walk to the elevator and up to the room while i'm drunk :) It is generally quieter and more relaxed than other hotels on the strip, the pool is small but still nice, not super loud or crazy crowded like the venetian pool, for example. 

Also, a slight downside is the distance it is from the strip, but it is super close to the Wynn and they have a shuttle that goes there as well as Cesar's palace so it really was not as bad as I expected. And parking is valet only.

My husband was looking for somewhere to charge his phone when he discovered a USED CONDOM!!! Ugh. Happy birthday to me. We called downstairs & they offered to change rooms & sent someone up with a hazmat bag to dispose of my special birthday present. Meanwhile we waited about 15 minutes for someone to come up with our keys to the new room. We were subsequently late to our dinner reservations. The trump ruined my birthday. 

Our new room was at least clean & no condoms. But, one of the tvs didn't work & NONE of the phones worked. Also, Monday afternoon an employee attempted to enter our room while we were inside & had the do not disturb light on. Thank goodness we had that extra lock on the door & he didn't get in. Called front desk on our cell phone because we had no working room phone & they couldn't tell us who it was & why they were trying to get into our room.

We initially booked for two rooms with 2 queens each. The front asked if we wanted to upgrade for something like $700 per night. We negotiated down to $300 per night. The three bedroom penthouse was sick! Overall we paid $700 per night for the penthouse between 6 guys. Totally worth it.

This penthouse is bigger than most homes. 3000+ sq ft is ridiculous. I almost got lost inside the penthouse. That's how big it is. Full size kitchen, 3.5 bathrooms and lots of closets to play hide and seek. The views are also amazing. You get full view of the strip with no obstruction. Ceiling to floor windows. The master bathroom closet is bigger than most NYC apartments. 

Room service - excellent service but man the price of food is nuts and the food quality will make you sad. 

Elevators - we were on the 63rd floor and the elevators were surprisingly fast

After reading all the great reviews here I chose Trump for our stay.  It's well known for the quiteness away from the casino\/nightclub scene of the strip. However, my experience was not in agreement with this.

Our room was on the 22nd floor with a view of the strip facing the fashion show mall. The pool was on the same side as our room on the lower floors. The minute I stepped inside the room, I heard loud dance\/hip hop music coming from outside. It was soooo loud (especially the bass) I couldn't get a good afternoon nap after a long drive. I thought it was suppose to be super quite, but it wasn't. Along with the music, there were also loud train whistle noises coming from i dunno where.

I didn't wanna share a bed with my mom so I slept on the sofa bed. Although everything else in the room was super clean, the sofa bed was not. It had crumbs of food left over on the mattress from before. The housekeeping staff came in to prepare my sofa bed, but the sheets weren't that clean either. 

Other than this, everything else was great! I loved the free shuttle to and from Wynn, that made everything convenient. and It's right across from the mall, so that was great too!

I wish we had a room on the other side of the hotel away from the pool, that would probably make my experience much better",0,0,0

Got a deal through HotWire and paid a decent price for 2 nights (Friday\/Saturday).  This hotel is sliiiightly off the strip, but is still directly across a small side street from Fashion Show Mall.  It made it very convenient for us to get breakfast at one of two Starbucks inside the mall.  Mmmm...Also, because of its location, when taxis came to pick us up, the drivers took Industrial Blvd, which was waaaay less crowded than Las Vegas Blvd.  This saved us a lot of time and cab fare!  HOOORAY!

There is no self-parking lot here, so be ready with some cash to tip the valet people.  They are all very friendly and will signal for a cab for you 24\/7.  Trump also has shuttles going to Caesar's Palace and Wynn every day.  I can't recall the hours exactly, but I think for CP, the shuttle service ends at midnight every night.

All rooms come with a King-sized bed and a Queen-sized couch bed.  There is even a kitchenette and roomy fridge for those who want to make their own meals\/snacks.  Be sure to save room for the delicious fries and tiramisu from room service though!  Trust me!  You won't be disappointed.

All in all, I was quite pleased with this hotel.  I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to stay at a hotel that doesn't have a casino (GASP!)and is 100% non-smoking.  You are charged a little less than $23\/day for resort fees, which allows you to use the pool, internet, gym, and a few other ammenities.  So people, use their stuff!!!

Oh yes, be sure to lounge around by the family-friendly poolside (nothing fancy, but a good place to relax and cool off).  Free towels, lounge chairs, and umbrellas.  Cabanas can be reserved as well (not sure if it costs anything).",5,4,5

I called multiple times, was referred to their corporate business department and never received a call back. As much as I would like to stay here again in the future, this hotel has lost my trust and my future business. As a frequent Vegas traveler, I'd rather try other hotels that I can trust, even if it means paying for valet. (I also don't understand why they are charging a security deposit in the first place!

We booked on a weekend where most of the rates on the strip were $200 or more and this was one of the hotels with a rate lower than $200. I read so many reviews and did research before finally deciding on this hotel ...and thank goodness I picked this one. 

We arrived at the hotel pretty late. There's only valet, but they have shuttles to the WYNN and CAESARS PALACE (which my bf &I took fully advantage of) and the checkin was easy and the staff was really nice. There is no casino, so it was nice walking in without being greeted with the strong smell of tobacco. 

When you get on your floor and find your room, there will be one big door for 2 rooms. It's sorta like a little foyer before you enter your room. I can say you get a lot for your room than most of the hotels on the strip. We got the deluxe king bed (floor 37) and it was super nice. We had a little kitchen (sink, fridge, microwave, stove) in the room, but no utensils (which wasn't a big deal, just buy some utensils at a nearby walgreens or something). In the same room, there was a little sitting area with a couch, coffee table .... and then the big king bed which had the most comfortable pillows. The bathroom is super nice with a bathtub (w\/ a jet) that can fit 2 ppl, a two sink, a separate shower, and separate toilet with a phone inside. There's also a hair dryer and a makeup mirror for the girls. Plenty of towels in the bathroom so that was nice. Also they have a light system if you want housekeeping or not, without using the usual door handle paper. That was pretty cool. lol The wifi was pretty fast in our room despite the reviews I read from other ppl. Of course you get that from the resort fee you pay. 

Sadly we didn't take advantage of the fitness center or pool, but the room was more than enough for a good review. Many ppl complained about the train sound. For us our room was more towards the mall side, but you can hear the train. Yet it's not that loud for it to be an inconvenience (unless your room was on the other side). 

The shuttle services at the Trump was pretty good. You'll wait at the side of Trump and will wait 10-15mins for the next shuttle. It was a huge convenience for us bc we didn't want to drive nor did we want to spend on taxi. We mostly took the one to Caesar's and it probably took 10mins to arrive where they drop you off at the forum shops. 

I will definitely book a room at the trump the next time we go to Vegas because you get more than you pay for. If we booked at Treasure Island or Paris, I guarantee it will not be HALF as nice and accommodating as the TRUMP. Of course you sacrifice being near the strip, but there's shuttles so it's no biggie.",3,0,1

When you check in you have an option to upgrade to a bigger room from $20-$40. You get a good rest and depending on your upgrade you can either get a strip view along with the strip joint next door or if you get a standard room you get a strip joint view. Facilities are great and the service is superior as it should be with a name like Trump. They also have a shuttle to Caesar's Palace during the day. Expect no casino and valet service only.

I can't speak as well at all for the rest of the staff because the Housekeeping staff was apparently non-existent! The Bar Tender was unfriendly & the Concierge ladies at the front desk were always too busy to give us the time of day. 
Our One-Bedroom Suite was fairly clean. However, I didn't appreciate the fact that there was dust on every counter space within our bedroom. The kitchen had a dish sponge but we were not provided with any dishwashing soap! We were provided with one single small frying pan, nothing more. How were we to boil water or at least sauté our steaks? There was also a washer\/dryer, but again, no soap! 
On the following day, we called for room service & not to our surprise, housekeeping never showed up! I called again after returning from our outing & the operator gave me this very dry & sarcastic apology, assuring me that they would send someone up to provide us with clean towels.

 First time we arrived, went to the suite and found my 1 year old nephew holding a tablet we found on the floor and didn't know if he had swallowed any others.


 Went straight to Walmart where he started to be violently ill so came right back to the hotel and asked for a doctor. The EMT's from the fire station next door were called twice over the next 24 hours and the child ended up in hospital in Vegas and in LA a couple of days later. The tablet turned out to be an anti-inflammatory, which would have done him little damage.


 Went back again, I had to change rooms FOUR times in order to get one with all facilities working. There was a broken spa tub, then a broken TV, then they gave me a disabled room without a spa tub (half the reason for staying in Trump!) then finally a room where everything worked and not even an apology!!! In my brother and sister-in-laws room the cleaners left an open bottle of bleach, which the child very nearly got hold of!!


 I honestly expected Jeremy Beadle to jump out at one stage!


 Be careful as they charge an obiligtory $15 a day ""resort fee"" for 2 tiny bottles of water, a newspaper and use of the gym and pool (even though the pool was closed on our first visit!!).

The Good: The hotel is immaculate. The room we had was gorgeous (layout is very similar to The Signature Suites at MGM. It was a corner 1bdr suite on the 58th floor with a spectacular south facing view of the strip. There's an iPod docking station with an add'tl USB slot... perfect for charging multiple devices. The hotel amenities were clean, peaceful, and easy to navigate to. Beautiful pool, that thankfully wasn't over-crowded especially since it was J4th weekend. A nice sized fitness center... there were plenty of treadmills and equipment... I never found myself waiting to use anything. The spa was had a steam room and sauna that I was able to enjoy after booking a massage. There's a $20 resort fee added on to your bill but in my opinion is well worth it for what you get... 2 complementary bottled waters w\/every housekeeping visit... or you can call and request more water. Complimentary drop off & pick up shuttle service to\/from the Wynn or Caesar's Palace. Access to Pool, Spa, & Fitness Center. FREE WI-FI. The Bad: Our beautiful corner suite developed a horrible odor coming from the master bathroom... smelled like mildew. We called front desk nearly every day to send someone up to take a look. Turns out there was a leak in the laundry room which is locked off and only available for the owner(s) of the suite. Maint. came to fix the leak and had to come again to run a wash cycle to get rid of the stale water left in the washer. However, the smell never left the bathroom. To prevent it from stinking up the suite, we kept the bathroom door closed and used the second bathroom in the living room to shower and get ready. It was terrible that we couldn't make use of that huge master bathroom and spa tub. Unfortunately, no one offered to have switch rooms until the night before we were checking out. Secondly, there's a train that passes by on the West side of the hotel near the 15 fwy that you can hear very clearly even from the 58th floor!! We were in early one night and awoke at 3:30 am to a train passing by blowing his horn! Rude awakening. Other things I thought that might be good to know.... Pillows are way too soft for me, your head literally sinks to through... but the bed was comfy. There is NO CASINO in this hotel... this may be good or bad depending on what you're in LV for. For the most part, not having a casino downstairs was great for our trip... it was less crowded (especially on J4th weekend) and peaceful. There was one night I did regret it when I awoke at 4am (thanks train!) and could not get back to sleep.... then would have been a great time to have a casino conveniently located downstairs. Nonetheless, figure out what you want out of your hotel during your trip before you book a non-casino resort. Also, not sure if it was just our room, but the volume on the TVs were super super low. I had to max out the volume just to hear anything. Kitchenette and full Kitchens have a microwave & stove with dishware & utensils.... so if you wanna save some $$ on grub... walk across the street to the ABC Store inside Fashionshow Mall and buy some pre-made sandwiches, salads, etc... they even sell alcohol and you can store that in the fridge in the room!

There are magnificent chandelier's hanging from the ceiling that greet you when you walk into the lobby making the lobby feel regal and ooze with classiness. For some of my friends who had never been to Las Vegas, this made us feel like we had arrived for the best Spring Break yet. Our room was spacious and beautiful with a great view! 

In addition to the beautiful interior design, the staff was excellent! Everyone was friendly and greeted us when we walked into the lobby, bar, pool area, etc. The customer service is through the roof and we felt extremely comfortable and well cared for. We went out to some of the top night clubs and either walked or took a taxi back to the hotel- The Distance isn't too far. We all loved the bathroom!

The pool and hot tubs are fun but nothing to write home about. The pool is big enough to swim laps and the hot tubs were a good temperature.

Once everyone was quiet and settled, we could hear the loud roar of the passing train and traffic outside. Our small ventilation window didn't close all the way because of the broken latch. Next was the spa jetted tub. After being woken up by the passing trains I decided to take a bath, but to my surprise the jets were super low in the tub and massaged almost nothing. 


On the bright side the staff was extremely courteous. Valet even upgraded our parking spot because they felt ""we waited too long,"" to receive our car because of the Labor Day chaos.. Our bed was extremely comfortable, the pool and gym are awesome.. But we'll be back.. After-all its staff made it deserving of a second chance.",2,0,0

Price is moderate for Vegas standards

The Trump is what Bellagio tried to be, but couldn't.  See, the Bellagio is there to make itself look good.  Trump is there to make you feel good.

We got a deal on Trump over Priceline, for a Saturday night during NASCAR weekend, about an hour before we took off from Camarillo Airport for McCarran Int'l.  For $169,  I wasn't expecting much.  BTW, If you're a fly-in pilot, don't be intimidated by McCarran.  Its controllers are very helpful and Signature Air Support was as nice to me in my Cherokee, as they were to the Citation pilots.

Approaching the hotel from the ""back"", we drove to the Valet area.  We didn't see any self-parking and it turns out there isn't any.  We left our car with the friendly valet. 

One of the first things we noticed on entering the lobby, was openness and no signs.   And it was quiet.  No DING-DING-DING CLANG-CLANG-CLANG.  No slots, and no smoke.  I almost forgot I was in Vegas.... except for the women in sequined mini-dresses and men in blond wigs wearing pink skirts.  There was something that resembled a check-in desk, so we headed for that.  The pleasant agent gave us our choice of rooms from what was available, asked if we'd like to upgrade, and if we needed any other assistance.  Wow, that was way different from most indifferent receptions at the casino hotels.

There are two elevator banks, one for the bottom half of the tower, the other for the top half.  The elevators were fast and clean, transporting us to our floor with ear-popping speed.

When we approached our room, we were a bit confused.  One door for two rooms... Oh!  No wonder the room was so cheap.  We're sharing it!  Just kidding.  We opened the door to find a marble vestibule and two doors behind it.  We inserted our card key into our door and it clicked without having to swipe it a zillion times.

We entered the room and... wow.  Big, light, bright, modern, quiet and tasteful.  An empty (yay!) Sub Zero refrigerator was under the granite counter. Above was a cook-top, prep-sink, microwave, coffee maker, and toaster.   

The bathroom had two obscured glass enclosures -- one for the walk-in shower, the other for the toilet.  At  the lower center of the bathroom mirror an un-silvered square housed a TV behind it.  On the counter sat a remote.  Unfortunately we couldn't get the TV's sound to work.  Oh well.  We weren't there to watch TV.  To the right of the counter was a jetted tub, large enough for two.  With the exception of the mirror TV, everything worked.

We immediately hooked up with the WiFi.  For guests it is free.  We got a full signal and fast response.

Initially, we were in the room just long enough to change and go back out to dinner, which we needed to drive to.   We correctly identified the valet desk (no sign), handed them our ticket and waited about 20 minutes for our car.  By that time we were a little grumpy but shrugged it off.

After dinner we dropped off our car and went on up to our room to relax.  The bed was comfortable -- my only complaint is the flat sheets both top and bottom.  They tuck-in the top sheet under the bottom sheet so when you pull the top sheet out to get in, it pulls the bottom sheet out from under the mattress.  I had to make the bed again which is a little tough since the mattress is down in a platform.  A small frustration -- I wish they'd use fitted sheets or an elastic fastener.

The next morning we went downstairs for breakfast at DJT Restaurant.  The buffet was $20 and was pretty OK.  The coffee (Starbucks on tap) was good, and the bacon was lean and well smoked.  There was a chef making omelettes; they looked and smelled good.  I had lox and bagels

After breakfast we decided to check out the pool \/ spa.  The pool was OK; decent size, nothing fancy.  The weight-room was well appointed.  We asked for a menu of spa services.  OMG. An hour massage starts at $150.  No thanks.

We checked-out over the TV in our room and left without a hitch.... except for getting our car.  This time, we waited for 40 minutes.  When we saw another couple come out, give their ticket at the stand, then receive their car 10 minutes later, we asked what the F was going on.  Whoops, maybe your request didn't get in our system.  Are you kidding me?  About 10 minutes later, our car appeared.  Grrr!

Even with the valet annoyance, we'll be back... but we'll self-park at the Nordstrom's parking structure across the street.",3,0,0

Before our FINAL PURCHASE I consulted with trusty fellow YELPERS to get the REAL low down scoop. 

I definitely CONCUR this place is pretty bomb.  It was a LOT busier than we expected and when we first arrived the line to check in kind of gave me a nervous stomach.  I was pleasantly surprised at how fast it moved and how kind the staff was.  They were SO accommodating. We arrived there early (before noon) and were crossing our fingers that they'd let us check in early.  They were unable to get us our room right away but gave us complimentary spa passes so we could get ready and freshen up for our day of debauchery awaiting us at Encore Beach Club. 

The Spa was LOVELY.  They gave us flip flops, our own lockers, and a PLUSH robe. It's everything a spa is supposed to be, serene, clean, calm and fresh.  There are private dressing rooms fully stocked with high end hair spray (alterna) hair ties, combs, brushes, curling irons, blow dryer, etc.  And there are public vanities as well.  I was unable to get into the hot tubs and pools, however I can imagine they were WONDERFUL because everything else was.  The showers were rain down showers and all of the products smelled amazing. 

Our room was quite nice.  It had a kitchen with two stove top burners, a microwave, a fridge and a toaster.  We were disappointed that we didn't pack some ego waffles and hot pockets for the late night munchies. :) The king size bed was LOVELY and we also had a sofabed that turned into a queen.  

The bathroom was great.  There was a large tub, this excited us immensely as my 6'4"" boyfriend doesn't fit well in typical tubs so a bath is ALWAYS out of the question.  This tub was HUGE and it was a spa tub with 3 different settings.  It was SO relaxing.  The shower was HUGE (fit 2 VERY well) too and the actual toilet area was separate from both, such a nice touch!

They had excellent service, they feature an express room service 24 hours a day.  Everything comes within 15minutes of ordering.  It's pricey but ALL room service is.  

Place is nice but I can say that we WON'T Continue going because Trump is an idiot.",8,3,2

It started off with an effortless check-in with Chris, who helped us in obtaining the best room possible! Thank you! I loved our room, which was really similar to The Signature in the one-bedroom suite layout. The best part of this room was the TV inside the mirror!!! SO cool! 

Staff was super nice and always made sure we were taken care of when obtaining a taxi\/limo, opening doors for us, greeting us, the whole work. I felt like VIP here. One late night, three of us wanted to go to the Wynn and tried walking there in the semi-dark night, and the Escalade that worked for Trump saw us and told us it wasn't safe to do so and gave us a free ride there! 

When you turn on the TV in the living room, it also says ""Welcome to Trump International, (insert name here). And they have this cool tic-tac-toe game on the living room coffee table to pass the time. 

The pool is a little small, but relaxing if you prefer a more chill atmosphere. Right next to Fashion Valley Mall with a quick stroll, which  leads you into Bellagio. No casino here, but there is a fine dining restaurant downstairs by the lobby.

Oh, and watch out for those squeaky clean rotating doors... They have been known to cause injuries to intoxicated people. 

Definitely a hotel to stay at and on par with The Signature. Love.",1,0,0

I was really looking forward to staying at Trump specifically because of the Trumpkids program as I am traveling with my 7mo baby.  When I booked the reservation I had specifically asked for a full size crib to be set up which I was told will not be a problem.  The rep did not say it is ""subject to availability"".  When I checked in I was informed ""the crib has already been set up in your room"".  I was really excited because it was near the baby's nap time.  When I walked in, no crib.  Called housekeeping, and was sent a pack n play with no sheets.  There was no explanation and none of the other kid items were brought over such as shampoo, children's book as described in the program.  Called housekeeping was transferred to concierge who than had a mgr called me.  I was told ""a crib is subject to availability"" and everything will be taken care of.  So we decided to take a swim first. When we returned, there is now baby shampoo but still no bedding or anything else! I am starting to get upset so decided to go downstairs to speak to a mgr.  After explaining to Jerry the situation he said ""you are correct, it should've been done right the first time and I'll personally see to the situation and give you a call"".  Went to dinner and back, there is now some sheet in the pack n play AND A BOTTLE OF INDUSTRIAL CLEANER INSIDE"".  This is a five star hotel! I was expecting things to be done right UPON ARRIVAL and when item requested are not available I expect to receive an explanation! No call from Jerry to say ""no crib was available"" as well!! Now it's near 4am and I can't sleep because I have no choice but to share the bed with my infant which is unsafe!

There's also a free (hotel) shuttle that takes you to a couple of the other resorts but I can't recall which ones specifically at the moment. Keep in mind it's a good idea to either get a room as high as possible or facing the south end of The Strip due to the simple fact that the hotel is located near a set of railroad tracks.

He's a nut.  But that's not the point of this review.  The hotel is F'N amazing! I mean A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!  We checked in on a Friday afternoon around 4:30.  We had a very short wait in line and were greeted by Niko.  He was genuinely friendly and seriously made us feel welcome.  

Being a local, I felt obligated to ask for an upgrade.  Niko happily obliged.  He could give us a strip view OR for a nominal charge he'd allow us to upgrade to a one bedroom suite with a strip view.  Well, ""hells yes we will take that one bedroom suite!""  Niko handed me back my credit card with both hands!  How awesome is that? Felt like I was somewhere in Asia receiving service like this.  He offered to walk us to the elevator, we kindly declined for those waiting on line behind us needed their rooms as bad as we did:-)

We were given a room on the 59th floor! The hotel still went higher.  I didn't know we had towers so tall in Vegas.  Our room was insane!  We walked in to find warm hues and a very upscale kitchen.  A subzero fridge!? I mean really! They went all out.  There was a large dark brown sofa sectional that was quite comfortable.  The view was insane!  We had a perfect view of the whole strip.  You could see the Bellagio fountains!  

The bedroom area was equally as nice and the bathroom...WOW! It was huge!! Gigantic!  Oh, there were actually 2 bathrooms, one in the main sitting area\/living room and one in the bedroom.  Perfect for entertaining.  There were 2 large flat screen televisions that we were able to use with our laptop and HDMI cables.  TV binging at its best!

This is a non smoking hotel (thank God).  My hubs smokes on occasion so we easily went down to the floor with the gym, spa and pool.  You could walk out the north door and there was a huge patio where one can smoke.  Room service was crazy fast, less than 30 minutes!!  It's not cheap but then again is it ever?  The service at this hotel is top notch and in all honesty, makes me proud.  I'm a Vegas native and happy to see there are some places that still have pride in what they do.  

Cesar Q. and I had an amazing 3 night staycation at this place and will definitely be back sooner than later.  I can say this place tops Signature where we typically stay when enjoying a ""staycation"".

Yea, it was a while ago, but it was such a positive experience, and I'm doing my Vegas reviews right now, so I wanted to share my recollection (as I simultaneously browse through pics of that weekend)

I'm gonna do bullet points for this review:
- Lobby = quietly elegant, and there is a grand piano at the lounge area
- Bed = comfy, but the details elude me
- Room = soft yellow\/gold tones, spacious, and with a kitchenette that includes a microwave. Oh, and there's a couch your leech of a buddy can sleep on too.
- View = decent one of the strip, though you are actually a block away from the center, so it's not the best
- Bathroom = there's a TV built into the mirror! And the shower was, at the time, the biggest I've ever been in -- I remember I could imagine myself in it with 4 more girls easily!  Unfortunately, in reality, I had myself a nice shower before soaking in a bubble bath.

I'd definitely stay here again if I was aiming for a nice, quiet getaway in Vegas.  It's close enough to all the action on the strip, but don't try walking back to the hotel from TAO -- it's farther than it looks.  Another reason it's so quiet is because there's no casino.  If you want to be where all the young, loud, drunkenly crazy, and hopefully half naked girls are, don't stay here.",1,1,1

(about 150 per night) (how could you go wrong with the name and reputation that follows Trump?) Sure, there is no casino, but this makes this hotel perfect for the non-partying Vegas goer (do they exist or am i the only one?). Even if you do party, there are courtesy shuttles that will take you directly to the strip. The rooms are nicely designed (jacuzzi tubs!) and make for a very comfortable stay. It is located off the strip, which in my opinion, is great because there isn't any problem with pedestrians that do not obey the ""do not walk"" sign, who yell at you for proceeding at your green light while they are in the middle of the intersection.   

Another great thing about Trump was that I checked out to hotel hop over to excalibur hoping to save $100 on a night in vegas. I got there and there was a lovely bed bug on my pillow waiting to greet me. I immediately packed my bags and left, went back to Trump and told them I had nowhere to go. They offered me a room at 20% off and let me stay at the snap of a finger. FANTASTIC!

When we pulled up, we were greeted by many of the staff and were treated with such service.  They attended to our luggage and explained to us the process since it was our first time.  The entire hotel is non-smoking and was a big plus for us as we don't smoke.  In addition, it is only a hotel, no casino in the lobby like most.

Darryl, the manager of the valet folks, personally took our luggage to us since they were very busy.  He gave us a wonderful welcome to the hotel and offered any further assistance to us.

1. It's quiet. I needed some sleep, stat.
2. Jet tubs + TV's in the mirror.
3. No smoking, no casino, no screens flashing all around you.
4. Service was almost as good as the Four Seasons

Why they don't get 5 stars:

1. They don't have enough umbrellas or shade by the pool. This is Vegas. I'm pale. And it's hot. My pool time was cut short because of this. Not cool. 
2. The room was void of robes and they ran out of the wine I ordered. However, they did refund my resort fee when I mentioned how I wasn't completely relaxed because of this. 
3. The free wifi was slow. I hate slow Internet. 

I think it's a great hotel if you prefer somewhere a bit off the strip, expect great service and don't want the noise and smell of a casino.",1,2,0

You've done an excellent job with this hotel and I can't ask for anything more.  The only real complaint I have is that this hotel is situated on the outskirts of the strip which really defeats the purpose of going to Vegas.  If you're there for a weekend getaway and you're not really looking for the Vegas adventure.  This hotel is perfect for you.  So if you're looking to gamble you're out of luck because this hotel is only a resort and not a casino.  You'd have to travel to the Wynn or Encore which is the closest Casinos to satisfy your gambling needs.  

For entertainment and shopping, there's the fashion mall which is located right across the street from the hotel lobby.  The rooms are fit enough to house a king and his queen.  The customer service is friendly and helpful so you wouldn't have to worry about difficulties that you might run into.  As a word of advice to future patrons...this hotel isn't surrounded by the robust excitement of vegas life.  To get the vegas feel you'd have to travel a short distance to the strip and other entertainment venus.  The Donald has done it again with this hotel!  Cheers!",0,0,0

This hotel is well appointed, the decorations are tasteful, and the hotel is very clean.

* Nonsmoking

* Great bathroom

* Strip-view room also has a view of rail lines. Be prepared to hear train horns at 2AM.

* Mandatory valet parking which can be sloooooow at peak hours

is conveniently located by the Fashion Mall and connected on the other side of the street to Wynn hotel. The hotel offers its guest shuttle rides to Wynn and Cesear's palace, on weekends till 2 am and on week nights till 12 am. They run every 15 mins. 

I say this because people can be deterred by booking this hotel since its not exactly on the strip. However, the cost is more affordable and you still have the luxury of the Trump.

The hotel, has a nice pool area and offers a cool restaurant\/bar area. Personally, I was impressed with decor and service, but the rooms..well where should I start.

The boyf loves using his Persian ways to get us an upgrade,it always works and I wished he was an attorney because his negotiation skills is on fleek...yes I used on fleek and I will continue to use it. 

We had the city view suite with a mini kitchen,sofa bed, jacuzzi bathtub...the works.. However, the decor was a poor mans version of the Venetian... the bathroom had a his and hers area which was great because a girl needs her space. The toilet and bathroom had heavy glass doors that slammed behind you; which can be an issue if you are with little kids. Also, the shower head sucked ass! Here I am trying to scrub and the shower head was a POS (fill in the blanks). Once again, poor mans Venetian.

In addition, it is right across the street from the Fashion Show mall which has LOTS of GREAT SHOPPING and restaurants. I also had an amazing massage at the spa with Nakisha (highly recommend!). This hotel is also very close to the Wynn, which is a big plus for me (if you are too lazy to walk, there is a free shuttle that runs to the strip every 15 min).

When you first walk in, you'll feel like a bum walking in some fancy shmacy hotel, but every staff member is glad to see you and treats everyone ever so nice. From cleaning maids, doormen, and shuttle drivers. All very cool people.

Some tips: 
*Free shuttle takes you to Wynn or Cesar's Palace, runs until midnight, and later on weekends.
*You can checkout using your hotel tv.

This is a lengthy review consisting of three parts; overview, concerns, and people that made our trip special. 

Part I:

We made our reservation through the blind-bid through Hotwire. We did get an excellent deal but we made up for that with the amount we spent once there. :) This trip was for our eighth anniversary and I wanted it to be really special. When we had our reservation confirmed I called to ask if I could pay to upgrade to a strip view. I was told I could. Once I made the plan to do that and then started asking about some items such as flowers for the room I was asked about the occasion. Barbara, the in-house reservation specialist told me that she was going to upgrade our room for free because of our anniversary. What a pleasant act of kindness that was very appreciated. Not only that but she ensured  that we had a high room with, the best view of the strip one could imagine.. 

The room was large and modern. The bed extremely comfortable and the bathroom huge. The Jacuzzi tub was a nice touch as was the enormous shower and the tv build into the bathroom mirror. The room was clean. Even better than I had planned when I made the arrangements, rose petals covered the floor, bed, and Jacuzzi tub and the flowers I had ordered were beautiful and centered in the room in front of the huge window overlooking the strip. 

Throughout our stay we used in-room dining several times. All were exceptional though a bit pricey. The food was great (for the most part) and the speed and quality of service was fantastic. Well worth it. I had also ordered chocolate covered strawberries and a fruit plate which were brought up by in-room dining shortly after we arrived. Delicious and well presented. 

The hotel has wifi included in the resort fee and it was fast. Also included in the resort fee were valet parking (we flew in so that was not used) and a courtesy shuttle to the Wynn and Caesar's Palace. We used the Caesar's shuttle several times a day.  It was an excellent option. Typically it ran every 15 minutes and only once did we even have to wait that long and in that case it was 20 minutes. Other than that it was around the 8 to 10 minute mark. The shuttle drivers were great and I will talk about one in more detail later.

The concierge's desk was very helpful via phone prior to arrival (arranging the flowers, rose petals, chocolates, and fruit) and during our stay arranging trips, reservations, and limousine service. 

Since the spa experience was so amazing I will talk about that in the last section of this review. 

Part II:

Though our stay was truly special there are a few reasons I did not rate this hotel a 5. Frankly, aside from the people I will talk about in the final part of this review, the customer service was lacking.

The housekeeping staff was awful and did whatever they felt like regardless of the ""housekeeping request"" or ""do not disturb"" lights being lit. When they did come in they just ""straightened up"" and did not vacuum or sweep. In fact, the common hallways were vacuumed only once during our stay and it was after we had been there almost a week. When we wanted our room cleaned it wasn't, when we didn't they came in anyways and straightened up.

The train....almost every review has the same complaint and our is no different. We were on the front of the hotel 56 floors up and we still heard the train constantly. All hours of the day and night we heard that god-awful horn blaring. It was so bad that during our couple's massage in the heart of the hotel and in an interior room we were awaken from our relaxation by the blaring of the horn. Trump should pay the company to place a sound tunnel over the tracks adjacent to the hotel.

The doors to the rooms and the shared foyer are extremely heavy and almost impossible to keep from slamming. Almost slammed my finger in once at night trying to keep it from slamming. Our neighbors later on in our stay did not care so much about that and slammed the main door and their door several times a night. It was loud and paired with the train made for a difficult night's sleep.

Part III:

I am running out of space so I want to close with some people who made the trip special. Louis, one of the shuttle drivers, was so friendly and caring. He was such a pleasure to interact with we were disappointed when he wasn't the driver. The Spa staff was phenomenal especially Danyelle and our massage therapists Gretchen and Rafael who were professional and did an excellent job. Catalina did my wife's hair and makeup for our anniversary dinner and was so fun and professional. She did an excellent job. The spa even worked with me to have a rose waiting for my wife for that appointment. They went down stairs to the gift shop to buy a rose and bring it up so that my wife wouldn't know about it until she saw it. Thanks Danyelle!

Overall, it was a splendid trip and a wonderful experience. I recommend the Trump Hotel Las Vegas.",1,1,1

I stayed up till 4am partying last night and we're recovering from last night's action. Fortunately, we extended the checkout time to 4pm... then extended it to 5pm! What other hotel on the strip will do this for you? 

Aside from a rude managing parking attendant, Trump's Vegas staff are fantastic. They go out of their way to help you, whether you're looking to learn more about late night venues or trying to get good rates on your stay. We were bumped up to a suite (1000+ sq ft) for the price of a normal deluxe room. This was on a hot Saturday night... when every other hotel on the Vegas strip was SOLD OUT. 

Our room at Trump was amazing. It was a VIP experience that you shouldn't miss out on, especially if you come to Vegas without reservations--I've gotten the BEST rooms doing this. 

My advice: Don't book anything online. Talk to people on the phone or in person, whether you're booking a room at a hotel like Trump or even a show. You'll get the best rates, the best rooms, and the best seats in the house!

More about the suite we booked: the jacuzzi is deep and relaxing (the jets are pretty powerful), the room is beautiful with granite throughout, the bathroom is fantastic, the bed is very comfortable and the overall room seems very new\/modern\/sophisticated. And did I mention the 5pm checkout? Very good job, Trump!

We started by having breakfast with my family, going to F21 (the largest one ever), throwing on our new dresses, buying nail polish at the spa, hanging out by the pool, then making lasagna in my room.

I enjoyed staying at the Trump. The room is beautiful and located across from the giant Fashion Show Mall, all valet hotel, the service was a little slow. I think they were a bit understaffed, with that said, the staff was always friendly. We had an issue with the movie channels and engineering came up and fixed it right away. Housekeeping was also on hand with I was cooking the lasagnas. We did have to call them three times to come up, again, I think that is a staffing issue.

Tip: Since this is an all valet hotel call valet prior to going downstairs so that they can bring your car up. Also, strip facing views are amazing... we stayed in Penthouse 6000. It is not a casino so keep that in mind if you plan on booking and I didn't think the restaurant there was that great either. So, I guess what I am saying is I loved the view, the location, and the gorgeous room with full kitchen for my lasagna making...pictures on my blog",11,4,10

The entire property is immaculate, smoke-free, and far away from the standard Vegas scene, if that's what you're looking for.  The downstairs restaurant and lounge were very memorable, and every room is a suite.  We were able to fit in a few games of pool on their tables near the lobby.

Only problem is the location.  It's quite a walk to the strip, so cabbing it is a must.  The complimentary shuttles are always packed, but it's an option.  Also, there's no downstairs casino, so if you get the urge to play late at night, you're quickly discouraged by the lack of proximity to a machine or table.

Edit: Accidentally left a few items in the room on my departure: an electric toothbrush and a nearly-full bottle of D&G cologne. Called to see if they could ship them to me. Guess which one they couldn't find. I received my toothbrush by mail fairly quickly.",1,0,0

It was a very last minute booking but without trouble.  I really liked it being a non-smoking hotel but not boring!  No cigarette smell in the room=in my suitcase!  

Upon arrival, friendly valet boy came rush to us to take our car.  There's no self-parking, only valet (5-star from the start).  Lobby was nice and gilding everywhere (in a classy way) = luxury.  We got a room on the 55th floor = vip (I honestly felt important).  It was crazy HIGH but the elevator ride was about or under 35 seconds!  The room was very nice.  Bathroom had a insert tv to the mirror.  It was great for music because the sound system was nice and could be heard throughout the room.  Big double sink, we each girl didn't have to fight for the countertop space!  Plenty of storage also, open shelves and 2 closets.  The bed was clean and seriously comfy.  It was a shame that I only got to sleep in it for 3 hours (It's vegas afterall, nobody should sleep more than 5 hours a day.)  But the best thing to me was the 4o'clock late check out!  It was very thoughtful of the hotel.  I didn't have to get up early to pack and get ready.  

The only downside to me was the extra door for very 2 rooms which means you need to open 2 doors to get into your room.  While it is a good idea to block out all the noise from the hallway, however if your neighbor (next room) is hyper\/drunk or has the need to get in and out 10 times a day.  The automatic shutting door (a.k.a. slamming) is really annoying.  Mr. Trump should have spent extra money to get a silencer for every door.  That would have been 5-star all the way!",3,0,1

Trump is the true 5 star hotel in LV. If you check on travel websites you will find many run down casinos rated 4-5 stars but they are really far from the 5 star service you get at Trump. 

I am not a fan of Mr. Trump but this place is managed well, the rooms are top notch, the service is attentive and not intimidating. I say this because in some of the real high end places sometimes not everyone feels comfortable. I love that every room has a jacuzzi, and a kitchenette if not more. The lobby smells of fresh floral scent. I take a deep breath each time I enter the lobby. 

There is no self parking here and like all the other valet parking in this town, they are strictly tip only. My coworkers who are used to quiet nights didn't like being able to hear the train just behind the building 2:30am. They were on 32th and 51st floor so it doesn't seem to matter which floor you are on. I did eventually hear the train but it didn't really bother me. 

As long as I can afford it I will definitely return.",0,1,0

I heard so many great reviews and my bf's sister and her husband stayed here once and we got to see their rooms. The rooms at the trump are fantastical! My group of 3 just got the regular room but I believe it was still larger than most typical rooms on the strip! The room was spacious, clean, and there was plenty of closet\/storage space! The bed was the BEST bed I've ever slept in! SOO COMFY! I just wanted to sleep all day and all night! but, who goes to vegas to do that?! lol! Another plus was the sofa was a pull out couch, so my friend got his own bed as well. 

The bathroom is awesome too! I have a thing about small shower stalls but this one was great! Enough room to move around and not touch any walls, which i like! There is also a very large tub\/jacuzzi which I unfortunately didnt get the chance to try out. I will definitely go in it next time around though! Like all the other reviews mentioned, there is a tv implemented into the mirror. It was Its not a new thing haha. 

The service at the hotel is great, too. The check-in line wasnt too long and the lady that helped me was really friendly. She tried to offer an upgrade for 40 bucks to a one bedroom suite but I didnt  take it. Valet and the door man service were excellent too. Each time I brought my car up, there was someone to take down my information right away. The first night there, we tried to hook up our ipods to the iLove they provide in the room, but it was broken. We called the front desk and they quickly sent someone up to replace it. The only downfall I encountered was that both nights I stayed there, I tried to ask room service for an extra blanket for my friend on the pull out couch. Both nights they ran out of blankets. Really? They ran out? Weird. But oh well. They did provide us with the regular sheets though.",0,0,0

The hotel is at the end of a long alley-like street, a block or two removed from the strip. At night, this is the worst! the sidewalk cuts out halfway down too; and with a vacant lot on one side, your hoping just to make it back to the hotel without being mugged. 
You can't park your own car, you MUST use valet. This gets old, and expensive in tips. On our last night, we took our car out, not knowing that the valet had turned on the headlights for whatever reason (it was day). We parked at the Wynn for about 8 or so hours, and came back to a dead battery. We told the Trump's valet, thinking they would want to fix this, after all they did cause it. The valet refused to help us in ANY way, telling us to go ask the Wynn's valet people!
The rooms are nice, sure, but you can tell where they skimped. The bed's mattress was super cheap, and actually lopsided, I'm assuming the previous guest was a bit large. Also, the LG's televisions used in the room had no inputs to hook up a laptop or game system.
All in all, I guess stay here if you have to for a business trip or something. Don't stay here if you actually want to have a good time in Vegas.",2,0,0

I was upgraded to a one bedroom suite when I arrived because they were full... NICE!...and I like that when you pay the resort fee you get free bottles of water, shuttle service, wi-fi, and use of the spa to exercise. Usually you have to pay for all of these separately plus the resort fee, but not here. Hey, if they are going to charge you for it, might as well see what your paying for. The rooms still looked like they opened yesterday, very clean. Bathroom was huge and both bathrooms had showers, very nice. If my kids were with me, this would have saved a lot of time and arguments. The only bad thing I can comment on is that the hot water wasn't very hot, in fact one morning it was only luke warm. Not what you would expect from a big hotel. Be advised this hotel has no Casino and is non-smoking, which I didn't care about because I don't smoke and didn't miss the casino with the Wynn right down the street. In fact the shuttle will take you right to it's front door or to the Caesars Palace Forum Shops. Makes getting around to the strip easier because the Trump Towers are not on the strip, they are about two blocks west of the main strip and next to the Fashion Mall.

- Check in was lovely, and Camille at the front desk was lovelier! We had just rushed checked out of ARIA and was looking a hot mess practically fresh from bed head and Camille was so sweet, courteous, and friendly! Even offering us a 4pm late check out before we even asked due to us telling her about ARIA's 12:30 late check out. 

- Lobby was beautiful and smelled amazingly fragrant! Kudos to the Donald (as my handsome love would say) and I want those Chandeliers! 

- Rooms were super spacious and very tastefully done! Loved the subtle colors and beige tones. 

- Bathroom was the best bathroom ever. Super big and those Jacuzzi tubs?????? My fella did not want to get out! practically fell asleep in it!   

- Room service was yummy too! Thanks Tita Alma!

- It's a little off strip unless you cut through the Fashion Show Mall but that place closes and if your walking back... goodluck! You're going to have to walk through some ""deserted like"" roads to access the hotel. there's always a TAXI tho. 

Overall great place to stay... looking forward to staying again!",1,0,0

In my opinion, everything was extremely inflated price wise and I haven't been able to find anything to justify that. My non-smoking room stank of cigarettes and they refused to move me. The room service I ordered came cold (the burger) and when I asked them to recook it, they simply microwaved it, as it came up 5 minutes later and it's very easy to tell if something has been microwaved. Soggy and EXTREMELY hot. 

I expect more for the price point. Very disappointed :(",11,3,2

We had hoped for a quiet and relaxing weekend in Vegas..where it could just be the 2 of us, doing whatever we wanted to do and we were able to get it at the Trump.  The bed was luxurious and soft and the jet tub was just fabulous! 

I didn't quite give it 5 stars because it wasn't the most amazing place I've ever been to. Perhaps I'm a bit spoiled, but being in my twentys, I still appreciate Palms Place over this place, yet both of us agreed that we liked the Trump over the Wynn.  The room at Wynn was like staying over at a rich grandmother's house for the weekend.  The Trump Towers room had a good mix of modern decor with a classy feel.  The room came with a fully-equipped kitchen and empty fridge (unlike the Wynn), bathroom was more than spacious and room service was great as well.

The hotel itself was very quiet, very bright with gold bling bling everywhere and very boring.  We didn't mind it for that particular weekend of course, but it's not the hotel I would suggest for a bachelorette party or anything.  The valet wasn't slow and we never saw more than 2 taxis in the hotel driveway at the same time. Check out and check in was easy enough. The newspaper delivery missed us the first morning but found us again before we checked out. Overall we had a pleasant time there, and left after a quiet weekend with all smiles.",1,1,1

My friend booked the hotel on priceline where we were able to get a good deal. We were also upgraded to an exquisite suite. It had a master bedroom and bathroom, a second full bathroom, as well as a full living room, and fully equipped kitchen (full-size fridge, range, and sink.) The view was spectacular! You get a full view of the Vegas lights.

This is located off the strip, across the street from Fashion Show Mall. It's a very short walk to the mall if you want to get shopping in. Walking to the strip might take a while and we usually took our car to any locations on the strip.

Some things to note: there is a resort fee of around $30 per night for wi-fi use and other amenities . Luckily, the wi-fi was fast for me.

There are free water bottles replenished daily.

There's no casino in the hotel, which was a plus for me, as I don't like walking through a smoky casino to get to my hotel room anyway.

Valet is required, so if you plan on taking your car, be sure to account for that.

I believe they were originally intended to be apartments, so that explains the full kitchens. Unfortunately there's no cutlery, pots\/pans, or anything to actually make use of the kitchens. 

Room service was alright. The staff was great and the little tiny bottles of tabasco and ketchup were just too darn cute.

Also, the restaurant downstairs is overpriced and simply OK. I would not dine there again.

Overall, a very beautiful hotel to stay at and I definitely would stay here again. However, paying full price for the same suite might be a little too rich for my blood. (According to my friend, the actual cost would have been near $1200\/night.)",1,1,2

A couple weeks before we arrived I sent the hotel a message on their facebook wall asking them about a bed for my daughter and sure enough when we showed up for our reservations the sofa bed was already made up in our room. The room we had was not on the strip side and my 4 year-old LOVES looking out the windows on our trips. All our time spent in the room sounds like this "" Mommy, what do you see from up here? I see a helicopter and a hotel and a pool and another hotel and a big building and an airplane"" etc etc etc. They switched our room no problem and had a new bed made up for her in 15 minutes!

The hotel is so quiet, and smoke free and perfect for family travel! We've stayed at Luxor, Mirage and Venetian with our little one and I prefer the Trump over any of those by a long shot! We spent about 6 hours at the pool over the course of the weekend and she was in heaven! Housekeeping was great, they came in twice a day and were always smiling. Valet also was great, I forgot her stroller in the car and they had it out to me in 2 minutes, not an easy thing to run through a parking garage with, trust me!

I went to the gym twice while I was there and the first time, around 5:30pm was almost empty, it was myself and 3 others, the second day I went at 10:00 am and it was packed! I didn't have to wait for a machine though even with the gym being full which was great but I would suggest going in the early evening instead of the morning!

The one thing that was off was the darn train, but I can hardly fault the Trump for this, it's not like they built the tracks!

Even the location was great, right across the street from the Fashion Show Mall, it was a quick walk through the mall to the strip. We like to walk when on vacation so didn't mind the extra 100 yards to get to the strip, got to work off all those pina coladas somehow! 

The hotel really seems to cater to families and that is so hard to come by in this city. Kids menu at the pool cafe, kids pool toys on sale and every employee we came across fawned over our daughter, her being the ham she is soaked it all up! We will definitely be coming back to the Trump whenever we travel to Vegas with our little one in tow!",2,0,0

Few places, none in Vegas, offer the level of customer service that the Trump offers. When checking in Collins was incredibly helpful and even walked us to our elevator after giving us a tour of the main part of the hotel. I have never seen anything remotely close to that. Then when we asked housekeeping to come up to collect our shoes for the free shoe shining service (yes I said free!) we were equally impressed with the service we received from Christian. The customer service we received from Collins and Christian was unlike anything I have ever seen in Las Vegas, and I frequent the high end Vegas hotels numerous times per year.

After readings the reviews, I was shocked.  The entire experience for my husband and I was amazing.  The rooms are pristine with amazing views, lovely bedding, a huge tub with jacuzzi jets and a television in the restroom (built into the mirror).  Trump has done his legwork in terms of amenities.  Yes, there is a resort fee.  Internet, water and even complimentary headphones (upon request) are included.  Parking is free.  The staff really is welcoming and friendly with a professionalism of service unheard of in these days of attitudes and arrogance.  I love a hotel that has five star rooms and service yet strives to make every guest feel at home.  One negative, the service at the restaurant was sporadic but kind.  I waited for fifteen minutes for my coffee but I can forgive this as the server apologized and fixed the issue as soon as I reminded her.  The omelette was delicious but I could only eat half of it.    

The hotel is close enough to walk to the strip (around a mile).  There is also a shuttle to the Wynn and Forum shops.

Service was friendly and attentive, especially the valets.  Our ""studio"" room was up to date, clean and modern.  Stall shower was larger than my master bath (just kidding, but almost...).  This is a ""hotel only"" property with no casino.  Experience for us was relaxing.  Pool area was beautiful, but not as flashy as a casino.  On its merits, Trump is a fine hotel; we simply prefer a more centrally-located property with a casino, which we selected when we booked through hotwire.   Two issues keep us out of ""five star"" territory:

First, the $15.00 pp ""resort fee"" is a hidden (i.e., ""fine print"" not included in in the rate quote) per night cost that adds up.  I don't mind paying $15.00\/day for parking, but not an unexpected $30.00\/day for two people.  It is non-negotiable, regardless of whether you use the pool, or parking, or the very nice gym.  If this is not a hidden cost, and everyone is charged this amount, then it should be built into the rate of the room, so no one is surprised.  If I want a customer to return to my business, I don't spring hidden costs on them.  There can be no other motivation for structuring the price this way.

Second, location.  More centrally located and I could give Trump five stars.  As it is, I booked our room for two through hotwire and don't intend to use hotwire again as it advertised this hotel as being ""Central Strip,"" which it isn't.  Evidently, we neglected to read map in advance showing ""Central Strip"" as being a large, expansive area that includes this hotel on the corner of Fashion Show Drive and Industrial Avenue.  It is 2000' off Las Vegas Blvd. behind the old Frontier property and at least 20 minutes' or so brisk walking from Caesar's Palace.  We asked hotwire to allow us to rebook immediately and they pointed me to the fine print.  Hotwire is correct that ""a deal is a deal,"" and I won't be ""deal"" -ing with hotwire any longer.",2,0,0

Free bottles of water, free shuttle service and a beautiful pool where you can actually find a pool chair also make this place special.  It also doesn't feel like thousands of people are staying there.  It has a very intimate feel.  The location is pretty cool even if it's not on the strip.  It's across the street from the mall and only minutes from the Wynn.

The first is that they do not have a casino on site which means no smoke filled areas or loud crazy noises.  The second is that they were dog friendly (under 25 pounds).  We got both but that was pretty much it.

Upon check in the check in desk was friendly and greeted us well.  The room (a 1 bedroom suite which we paid for...we were not upgraded) was very spacious and the master bathroom was way bigger and better than expected.  The problem started from there though.  There were no paper towels or any towels in the kitchen (for the first two days), no soap or sponge to wash any dishes with, no Q-tips or cotton balls in the bath.  We expected more for this level of hotel.  Then when we pulled out the sofa bed, wow, you couldn't get more of an uncomfortable mattress.  We called downstairs and they brought up a feather bed but it was clear that although they could make the bed for us, they really didn't want to (2 males brought up the feather bed and extra blanket).  That unfortunately became a recurrent theme to this hotel, the staff would say ""what can we do to help"" but did not actually want to help...here are just a few examples:

1.  When down at the pool, we wanted to get a shaded umbrella for our 3 year old while she was eating her meal near the pool.  When we asked, the three people who were attending the pool acting like it was an inconvenience to them and they almost acting like the patrons weren't even there as they just conversed amongst themselves (I will say that the female that was down there was the one who eventually got our umbrella while the other two guys just stood there looking ""pretty"")

2.  When carrying my little one in my arms out of the pool area, NO attendant even attempted to open the double doors for us as we left the pool area back into the building, not on one occasion but both times that we left the area with our hands full.

3.  We had already packed and on our visit to the pool area one last time, I forgot that I had already packed the sunblock away.  When we got to the pool, I noticed that there was a rolling cart with clean towels that had 4 or so tubes of sunblock.  I asked the attendant if it was possible to borrow just a squirt to put on my daughter's face and he looked at me like I was an idiot and said ""We sell sunblock in the shop over there"".  Okay, note to self, the staff at the pool is absolutely useless and not helpful at all.

4.  I went down to the business center to print out my boarding pass.  Another guest was trying to do the same.  After about 10 minutes she looked at me and said, ""I keep sending the pass to the printer but it won't print"".  So I went upstairs and went to the concierge to ask them to print our boarding pass.  She looked at me and said ""you can do it downstairs"".  I told her about the previous guest and she signed and went ahead and got my info to acquire the boarding passes.  So sorry to bother you from doing you job!

5.  We left the hotel to fill up with gas and upon our return we told the Valet that we had run an errand and were ready to check out and were just going upstairs to get our daughter and our luggage and would be back in 10-15 minutes.  He said ""it shouldn't be a problem"" rather than ""oh, no problem"".  When we came back downstairs in 15 minutes with my daughter in my arms (she had just woken from a nap), they had moved our car to the furthest area away from the hotel.  What the heck.  Didn't we just tell them that we would be right back?  Now we have to walk even further with our luggage and my daughter once again in my arms.  There wasn't a back upof cars in the Valet area.  Our car was just an inconvenience to them.

In summary....we stayed here and when we had to deal with the staff, it was an inconvenience to them to do anything whether it was their job or any slight thing above and beyond.  I will not stay again with so many other choices in Vegas.

If you have kids and a dog like I did, please take my advice and stay at the Four Seasons.  We have stayed at the Four Seasons before and it was the absolute opposite of our experience at Trump.  We should have paid more and stayed somewhere where the kids are not a nuisance and are actually catered to and where the staff seems genuinely glad to see us, to help us and to give us anything that makes our stay more positively memorable.",3,1,0

How can you assure your customer they are charging you a certain price and then decide to charge you more? And when you ask for proof, they do not send it to you. After being over charged again and transferred numerous times, (not to mention I had talked to the employee when checking in and she told me the price I would pay, which was not what I was charged) Mckenna of course comes on the phone with the worst attitude, was rude, held the  proof that she overcharged me against me, called my uncle (because my uncle doesn't like to deal with drama) to ""vent"" to him, like he's going to take a strangers side - this woman should not be working here. She makes this 5 star hotel a 1 star, and I will definitely be contacting corporate for the harassment of her attitude, and the fact that she thinks she can ""ban"" someone from a hotel that is owned by your uncle who has raised you - is a joke.

First, the jacuzzi tub was broken. I called the front desk to ask about repairing it or switching rooms, but they were either unable or unwilling to do either. I'm not really sure which. 

Second, we awoke in the morning to one of the maids pounding on our door... demanding that we leave the room so that they could clean. When I went to the door, she very rudely said that we had already checked out, and that we needed to get out of the room immediately. Definitely not true. We told her we hadn't checked out, but she wouldn't leave until I told her I was going to call the manager to straighten this out. They said it showed we had checked out at 3AM through the TV. We weren't even in the room at 3AM... and we didn't turn the TV on the whole time we there. I don't know if it was their mistake, or if their TV is possessed and randomly checking people out, but it certainly wasn't a great way to wake up that morning. But they eventually agreed to assume that it was a mistake, and we went back to sleep.

When we checked out at 11AM (for real, this time), the front desk was not overly pleasant, but the manager did come out to apologize and took some small room fee off our bill as consolation. It seemed like a free night would have been a more appropriate resolution, but I really wasn't in the mood to fight with them.

I was moving from the Flamingo and got there at noon,  no problem.   Next day had a late night flight out,  4 pm check out no problem.

Free Water,  great gym and nice pool area.   The spa at 20 per day has a steam room that is so hot you start detoxing and sweating once you step in.   No gambling or smoking which I think is a good marketing move,   there are plenty of those activities  a few minutes away on the strip.    This hotel is not for everyone so let me clarify,  although they provide a shuttle to Caesar's,  it is a bit away from the strip area.

I usually avoid this hotel because it is located off the strip.  This trip, I had friends staying here so we spent some time at the casino and at the pool.  I was very impressed with the decor of the Trump.  The pool had a great lay out and was not overly crowded.  The pool had a very shallow section so you could sun bath in the water. It also had a section around the perimeter that you could sit and wade in the water.  My friends and I rented a great lounge bed right on the side of the pool.  The wait staff was friendly and attentive.  You could be served in the pool, by the pool or at the bar.

Upon walking in, we were greeted by Stanley at check-in with a warm smile.  You know how sometimes people are nice out of obligations, or because they are after a potential tip?  Stanley was neither of these, he was genuinely interested in helping you enjoy your stay by providing world class professional service.  He was courteous, helpful, and has an infectious smile.  

The lobby smelled clean (what??? In Vegas???) due to the fact that there are no smoky casinos attached.  If you are a player, they have a shuttle that leaves regularly to the casinos.  I like the division of church and state, staying here could potentially save you thousands of dollars!

The room we booked was spacious and bed comfortable.  It had a pullout sofa also, which we didn't use.  The refrigerator was a full sized one, and I can see how the kitchen can come in handy!  They do not provide pots\/pans\/server-ware  (I believe you can request) so plan accordingly.

The shower had good pressure despite being on a higher floor (45th), and we also enjoyed the spa.   We liked the spa so much that we went back again.  What can I say? I'm a spa connoisseur.  The only thing (no big deal) is no jacuzzi.  However, do not worry, there are 2 by the simple yet elegant pool.  

Tip: Pool is great for morning swim due to how quiet it is.  Water temperature is 82. :) I was fortunate enough to wake up, work out at the gym then finish my cardio off with a few sets of swim!

Leo at the spa gave me one of the most relaxing massages!  I typically go with a female masseuse, but he immediately put me at ease, and I would book him again next time without hesitation.  The price was reasonable ($160+ $25 off with checkin voucher) especially for the quality I received.  Just remember they add tip automatically so if you prefer to give cash (like I do), tell them ahead of time.  The spa also has one of the nicest smelling candle collections I've seen.

Parking is valet only (complimentary) but fashion mall is across the street, so you can easily walk across.  I love that Nordstroms is immediately across the street!

Let's start with the good stuff: I had a ""studio suite"" which consists of a large bedroom\/living area that's equipped with a fridge and hot plate - handy if you plan on staying for an extended period. The rooms are beautifully appointed and I absolutely love the deep marble tubs. Plush robes and fluffy towels are a huge bonus and the beds are wonderfully comfortable. 

Now on to the not so good: the room service is insanely expensive and the food I had was not good. I ordered french onion soup for lunch one day and it was totally inedible. Far too salty and served lukewarm for the INSANE total cost of $20. Breakfast wasn't good either - the only decent items we had from room service was the coffee and a fruit plate. We didn't try the restaurant here in the hotel, so I can't say if it's any good or not. It's important to point out that Trump isn't on the strip so you have to walk about 7 minutes to the nearest restaurant.

The other downer is that there's no casino at Trump, so if you're into gambling, you definitely won't want to stay here.

And finally, for the totally unacceptable: communication with the outside world while staying at the Trump is next to impossible. We learned that this is due to the fact that the building is plated in 24K gold. Luxurious perhaps, but totally stupid move - being here on business and having no cell service is simply unacceptable. And don't even try to use the land line in your room - just opening up a line costs $12, then 50 cents per minute thereafter! The wireless internet was horrendous as well. It costs $12 per day and for the most part, I couldn't even get it to work. Props to the front desk - they reimbursed me for the 3 days I had paid for. In short, it was totally impossible for me to get any work done here.

I tried everything I could do to get out of the damn reservation, but I couldn't. So I decided even though it was off the strip, no casino, and only one small restaurant, I'd have to make the best of it. 

The hotel is beautiful. As soon as you pull up you are greeted by multiple valets\/ bellhops who are more than eager to work for their tips by opening your door for you, grabbing your luggage and wheeling it away for you. Check in was a little bit of a wait, small front desk with only 4-5 employees to check in everyone. But try had a little beverage station to quench your thirst while waiting. They employee checked us in, and walked us to our elevator. Btw hidden hotel fees suck. I'm never using Hotwire, Priceline.. Again. $56 dollars later... We headed to our room. Which was kind of confusing because it had two numbers for one set of doors. Well there were two doors inside the first set of doors. We get in our room, and it was fabulous. Nothing too over the top. Huuuuge tub!! Oh my goodness. Best part of the entire room. They told us we had a city view. Opened the curtains... Yes it was a city view. Las Vegas city. Not the strip.. Lol oh well. It was still pretty. Kitchenette was nice, but I went to vegas to vacation.. I was not about to cook. Anyways. We had an issue with our tv, it wouldn't turn off, they sent someone ASAP.

We booked a regular suite during our original reservations.  However, upon arrival (and after flashing my military ID card) the young lady upgraded us to a one bedroom suite.  Check-in was great.  However, they didn't have our reservation in the system when we arrived which worried us.  We were told that reservations coming in from Expedia weren't actually input right away.  I said, ""Uuh yeah but we've had these reservations for months so how would be have been assured of the room we pre-paid?""  She said it happens all the time and no biggy.  After a phone call it was taken care of with no problems.

When we arrived in our apartment we just about went crazy!  Absolutely BEAUTIFUL.  The place was HUGE and in all honesty, two of us could have lived here indefinitely. haha!  Huge living room, dining area, full kitchen with Sub-Zero appliances...real\/beautiful oven, dishwasher, etc...all stainless.  Granite counters, all utensils, plates, cups, glasses, etc.  There was a full bathroom off the living room.  Flat screen TV and a great sectional.   Then you go into the huge bedroom with a California king bed\/featherbed.  Another flat screen, TONS of closets, storage and a safe.

The service was amazing, the room service (which we had several times) was great, and the bedding\/linens were very high end.  

We loved it that The Trump does NOT have a casino so they concentrate solely on your hotel stay without the distraction of others coming into the hotel demanding service.

I had read that if you ""name your own price"" and lowball it, you'll almost always get Trump, so I was happy I took this route.

We had the studio with the ""bad"" view because we didn't want to pay to upgrade and weren't savvy enough to try the $20 trick.  Note: if you want to upgrade the traditional way, it's $25\/night for a better view and $50\/night for a 1 bedroom.  The resort fees were $15\/day and while you used to have to pay a $22\/day surcharge for gym and $14\/day surcharge for overnight parking, both of these are no more.

The studio was pretty spacious (mind you, this is my first time going to Vegas so I'm not able to compare it to any other hotels).  Most importantly, it was extremely clean.  When we decided to go away for the weekend, we heard about dirty Vegas hotels and wanted to stay away from these... so we were relieved that everything was spotless.  There was a hot plate and mini-fridge, as well as a microwave and some cookware, but we didn't use any of these.  The bed is really comfy though I think as others pointed out, the mattress is considerably smaller than the bed frame.

The bathroom is flipping awesome... maybe it's because I have a cramped bathroom at home, but first off - there's a giant jacuzzi and a giant shower - both of which are separate.  The bathroom is the size of the dorm room I had in college.  And the robes that you can use are really comfy too.

The pool is fine - I doubt that it's as flashy as most Vegas pools but it was perfectly okay by us.  Lots of people drinking in there, but also a lot of kids.  This seemed to be one of the more family-friendly hotels, since you don't need to walk through a casino to get to the rooms nor are you inhaling second-hand smoke 24\/7.  The smoke-free environment was a big plus for us, as was having no casino.  

The location is off the strip, but it was about a 5-minute walk from the Wynn.  There is also a free shuttle to TI that runs every 15 minutes, btu we just walked to the strip and took the bus to get to places like Mandalay Bay.  During the day, you can cut through Fashion Show Mall to get to the strip if the heat\/lack of a good pedestrian environment (i.e., sidewalks) gets to you.  There were plenty of cabs at the entrance, but we didn't want to pay an absurd amount to travel in 1\/12 mile increments.  

The staff was all friendly and accommodating.  We checked in just after noon on Friday and did the 4pm late checkout, which was really nice because we were able to make a few last stops before hitting the road.  If we ever visit Vegas again, we plan on staying here again!",4,1,1

After staying three nights, I can only conclude that some people are just high maintenance.

The hotel and its interior are very gold! Oddly, I'm normally quite disparaging of this aesthetic but in this case, I really liked it! The building has a white strip around the top which really works with the gold tint. Lots of marble too - great!

Unlike many of the other places in Vegas, this is a hotel - not a casino with a hotel attached. As such, it doesn't suffer from the stink of second-hand smoke and the generally noisy and zoo-like environment. The moment you walk into the bright, (naturally) lit, spacious lobby, you realize that it's an oasis from the strip.

Some mention has been made of its distance from the strip. Firstly, it's a 5 min walk, 10 tops. Secondly, it's through an air-conditioned mall, with Nordstrom, plenty of other shopping and cheap eats and coffee on your doorstep. If you're physically capable of a 5 min walk, I can only surmise that to complain about it means you're fat and lazy. Let me repeat that - fat and lazy. If you're one of these people, don't travel to any European city, as you'll be whining just to get to the end of the street.

Mention has also been made of a perfume that's piped into the AC of the lobby. True - and it's smells nice! I understand that it can bother those with a very sensitive nose but for the vast majority, it just helps make a nice environment (while we're on the subject of smells, the lotions and soaps provided in the rooms smell lovely).

Service was excellent. So many great individual interactions with staff who just excel at their roles and are super friendly. 

The room condition was excellent. Spacious ( very ), big beds and well furnished. Love the huge bathroom with double sinks, big tub and shower. Don't really know why the kitchenettes are there but not an issue. A TV in the bathroom mirror was just fun for its own sake. Odd design issue - couldn't find a single, central switch for all the lights. My personal highlight was the massage jets in the bathtub - if you stay here, you must try them out!

The resort fees seems to be the norm in Vegas and the general ethos in America. As a European, I prefer the price to be the price, taxes and all included. This extends to the valet-only parking, which is just an annoyance and not a luxury (i.e. valet in general is a silly American concept - if I'm driving a car, I can bloody well park it myself or I shouldn't be driving in the first place. And if I have a really nice car, why the hell would I let some stranger with limited education drive and potentially damage it?). Don't get me started on tipping which is just a way to degrade the working class to the status of plebs but I digress. I would definitely take note of the fact that parking at the adjacent mall is free, so is a faster option if you just want to pop in and out.

Used the gym - lovely and everything was in excellent condition with hand towels provided. The pool wasn't a party type of place, just a really nice luxury hotel pool.

My only issue, and one that might be unfair, is that when traveling in Europe, hotels always include breakfast. Doesn't seem to be the case here but if no-one else is doing it, then it's unfair to pick on any one hotel.

My companions mentioned that they can hear the train horn at various times during the night, so that can be an issue if you're a light sleeper. It's funny though - some reviews complain about the train noise but want to be on the strip, which surely generates much more noise at all hours!?

4 pm checkout also helped us maximize the value of our time in Vegas, though, again there's the mall parking as an option.

Another reviewer noted the weak water pressure from the shower. That bothered me too but I'm not sure why it exists - it makes sense from a water conservation perspective ( I'm all for that ) and that the Kohler fittings are water-efficient but then the bath water pressure is higher and taking baths is far more water-inefficient than showers. Odd.

The other clientele are middle to upper class, often professionals and well-travelled foreigners. Not to sound too much like a snob but birds of a feather...

The hotel bar closes way too early. Hotel bars are a great way to meet people, whether at the start of the evening or late night for one last drink. 

Bottom line : While in Vegas, I will ONLY stay at The Trump Hotel... but maybe not dine at the hotel restaurant until there's new management, as it seems to have some well publicized issues!",3,3,1

Please do not stay here! from tipping the lady to make ur pull out bed because they don't have double beds in the hotel room to tipping for valet because the don't have self parking to paying extra everyday to get on the strip because it's not on the strip to paying for a ridiculous resort fee of $20 per day. I have stayed at hotels in las Vegas that were on the strip that had better atmosphere amenities and best of all price even though they might not be 5 stars! Trump is basically trying to act like a 5 star hotel but they don't have the structure to back it up except for they provide all these services to you that they make u do. For example, they give u a $25 credit to their spa as part of their $20 resort fee a day, which means I probably have to spend a hundred dollars worth more in the spa just to  get my money's worth for being charged a resort fee. Furthermore, the pull out sofa bed is not 5 stars. It is very uncomfortable! Although I have to say my sister's bed which is the reg king size bed in the room is not that bad. Both me and my sisters woke up to a train this morning at 7am sat. I read this in the other reviews but one reviewer assured me this was not the case. Yes, the train does come and it is loud enough to hear it! It is loud,  but is gone in a couple of seconds, but I assure that u will wake up! Furthermore it is very close to a highway which is currently my 24 hour background noise. I can still sleep through it but its trying to fall asleep which is the problem. My advice is play it safe and stay at a hotel on the strip. If u aren't rich, but just want to have fun with ur family in Vegas this place is definitely not the place to splurge. FYI, the finishes in the room is nice and luxurious but even though this place just opened, u can see that some areas especially the tables and couches r beginning to worn out.",0,0,0

(5 for room & 4 overall hotel) Stayed this Friday & Saturday night and got it off hotwire secret deal for $138\/night. Our friends also booked a room and paid over $200 booking directly through the site. 

We got a handicap accessible room and we liked our room better. It had more space and flowed better. They had a heavy glass (textured so not see through) door for their main shower and one for the toilet. Also a huge window overlooking the strip by the tub. We had a huge walk thru shower w\/seat (can fit several people), no window or glass doors in our main bath. We had a sectional (w\/pull out bed) while they had a 2 seater sofa bed. They got 4pm check out and ours at 11am.

Pros:
- 2 bathrooms (technically 3 showers since there's also a shower in the huge spa tub) 
-very comfy beds & clean. Hotel lobby also smelled nice
- bedroom\/main bath is enclosed, and separate kitchen\/living\/2nd bath so we were able to have people drink\/hang in our room while kids slept in the other. 
-2 big tvs and 1 in bath mirror
-TONS of storage space and space in general
-full size subzero fridge, microwave, stove, oven, dishwasher - basically more than what we needed for a wknd trip
- free shuttle to caesars palace & wynn 
-not too crowded, non smoking, no casino (good for us w\/toddler)

Cons:
-valet only. Shuttle ends at 12am for cesars and 2am for Wynn on Sat. and 12am other days
-The walk to the strip is doable but ee passed dirt, and no sidewalks some parts and darker emptier at night. Maybe better to cut through the mall during the day. We survived w\/2 strollers, but rather not do again. 
-no dining options after 10, and since we arrived at 10:30 and just valeted, and nothing  close by, only option was room service. Room service was good but pricey.
($17 pizza, $13 bacon\/eggs\/hashbrowns etc)  
-we didn't have a problem with noise, but you can hear the train nearby so may be a problem w\/light sleepers
-small pool

We'd stay here again if we can get a rate under $200. We loved our room, but valet only, no late dining options, and a bit further walk w\/stroller is a bit of a hassle with us. We also had to wait for another shuttle since had 2 strollers & couldn't fit",1,0,0

I checked in yesterday after a hellish commute to Vegas that started with 10 hours of delays at the airport, babies crying and little kids kicking my seat and bad turbulence. Continued with a fight with US air about having my baggage damaged and 2 hour wait at Hertz. Finally checked in and got a light dinner and some gambling and crashed exhausted at 11pm.

Woke up at 2:30am to the sound of the loudest horn on the train. Another train's horn at 3am and the last one at 4am. Went to the front desk and they moved me to other side at a higher floor. Just heard another train fly by with their horn at full blast at 5am and another at 6m. I slept for about 3 hours. Never been more exhausted in my life.

The smell in the lobby was so good that I wanted to ask the concierge where they were getting the lovely scent.  Yes, it does suck that there is a $15 a day resort fee, but I booked the hotel for a weekend stay for $300, so the resort fee really didn't bother me.  I searched high and low for the discount because the website usually has the suites for 200-500 for a junior one. But if you look online, you can find some lovely deals.  The suite was wonderful!  Modern and chic!  The jacuzzi tub was a perfect escape from a hard night of partying and it faced the mirror with the TV built right in, so I had entertainment.  There is a refrigerator, microwave, and stove top for cooking, but I never used it since we were all about the buffets.  There are complimentary water bottles and the Wolfgang Puck coffee was delicious.  The beds were ULTRA comfortable and warm. 

Another fav are the little switches they have for housekeeping.  You just push a button and a light pops up in front of your suite to tell housekeeping to either clean your room or to not disturb you.  Wonderful!  Your suite also has a doorbell, so people can ring your bell to let you know that they are there. 

My bf and I worked out at the workout facility and it was nice.  All the cardio machines have TVs built in, so you had something to watch while getting your workout on and  there are free water bottles in the mini fridge.  It overlooked the pool which was nice.  I didn't get to check out the pool because it was super crowded Sunday, but people were having a good time.

Yes, the valet does take a while since there were a lot of people in town for the fight, and it was be a total nuisance, but hey...everything else about the hotel was great, so I didn't mind the wait.  And even though we already pay $15 for the resort fee, remember to tip the valet!  I felt bad watching everyone grab their cars without tipping them!  They were all great and attentive!  For the amount of people that were there, they were doing the best they could at getting everyones cars.  I also tipped housekeeping before we left because she was wonderful at getting the room tidy.  She even organized  my makeup in the bathroom! A+++++

The best part about this hotel...the 4pm CHECKOUT TIME!  It was as though I was getting another day for free!  DO the express checkout from the comfort of your suite by using your TV so that you can avoid the lines downstairs for people checking out.  I don't know why people didn't do the express checkout.  It shows you your bill, you review it, confirm it, and then you're merry way!

Depending what time of day it is getting your car can take awhile. I prefer a self parking lot saves me the hassle of coughing up tip money every time especially if I am just stopping by for 10-15 min to grab something from the room. The whole valet only parking is a bad idea it'll be nice if it were optional with a near by self parking lot. 

I thought the rooms here were ok but for a 5 star hotel I expected better. I don't think they thoroughly clean the rooms as nice and pay attention to detail. I noticed hairs on the floor and Disneyland stickers on the cabinets where the hell did Disneyland stickers come from? 

FYI there is a $35 a day resort fee this will cover free valet, slow wifi and etc. Although the valet is ""Free"" I can't help but feel obligated to tip them every time it just feels wrong not to

Free bottled water, free wireless internet, free use of the gym, etc. As he explained that a free Las vegas local paper was included, I guess that I casually mentioned that I prefer USA Today. Not really meaning anything about it at the time. Wouldn't you know it, on my front door were two papers the local Vegas paper and a copy of USA Today!  WOW!

  The hotel never seemed crowded as the upper floors had its own elevator to speed things along. Interesting enough they do except dogs to stay as well.

1. Checked in at 4 and they said my room wasn't ready but they would upgrade me to a corner suite, it will be inspected in 20 minutes and they will call me.  After roaming around Vegas for TWO HOURS, no call.  I return to the hotel to inquire and they tell me the room hasn't been cleaned yet.. Then they offer me my old room back. 

2. Nothing works here. Remote controls, in room telephones, everything is broken.

3. Valet.  When you take a taxi from the MGM to the Trump the fare is about $11 which goes to $15 because you end up sitting there waiting in a cab for 10 minutes for the valets to clear the driveway.  

4. It's filthy. Rooms are starting to look worn out, carpets are stained.

It is NOT on the Strip.. But..it's across a Nordstrom. And that for me is a total Win.

It does NOT have a Casino.

It does NOT have the gross carpet.

It does NOT have the indoor cigarette smell. In fact.. as you walk into the lobby.. you are taken to a world of SPA smelling heaven. Like really. Whatever that is.. I want it at my home.

Such a relaxing smell that makes you enjoy your little home away from home awesome.

They do have a nicely equipped Gym; and a decent sized pool.

It could be a little bit hard to find space to lay in by the pool; but we always get lucky that we find a spot.

Loved their pinacoladas. Hated their Chips and Salsa. Like.. awful salsa. Ew.

The pool only goes up to like 4ft i think so that's not too cute. But i mean.. i think people use the pool just to look cute and not swim; right?

The bed was heavenly... Customer Service is great.

They do have a shuttle to the Cesar's Palace and the Wynn I think...

Loved the marble flooring in the lobby.

Near the Fashion Mall..",5,5,2

I appreciate that it's not smoke-filled and loud, especially when traveling with kids (it actually smells like magnolias or some other flower when you walk in). After a long day of sight-seeing and walking, it's also REALLY nice not to have to walk 2 miles through a hotel to get to your elevator when you're wearing heels. Rooms have always been clean, the strip view is beautiful, and prices tend to be better than other major hotels. My husband and I were disappointed when they changed mattresses a few years ago (they're not quite as comfortable now), but the new ones are fine. 

Staff has been fantastic 99% of the time, including the front desk, valet, and shuttle drivers. Had an issue with not having hot water when we got the 3-bedroom penthouse and the response from both the worker and on-duty manager were not what I expected. They made it sound like we had filled the suite over-capacity, which is why we had no hot showers. The suite was being used as a hub for a special event, but the people visiting in and out were not necessarily staying\/sleeping\/showering there and I was annoyed at their rationale.

We already have another trip planned and received a phone call from the concierge to see if there was anything they could do to assist before check\/in (schedule a show, etc.). I mentioned that we were celebrating a double birthday and the employee said she would notate our account so there would be a surprise for them in one of the rooms. Another employee was also very helpful in emailing me credit card authorization forms and coordinating multiple rooms under my name. Definitely looking forward to this trip and will update my review after check-out.",0,0,0

Don't get me wrong. This is a nice place to stay. The Jacuzzi tub was sweet. And, I could use the bathroom while my wife was using the vanity or taking a shower because the bathroom has three rooms in it. Yes, I know she is my wife, but let's keep a little mystery going in the world.",0,2,0

The Trump International Hotel had all this and more. Room service was good, not great, but good enough. Breakfast was always quick and service was really good. 

The rooms were kept clean and the little kitchen area gave you the option to prepare your own food, if you wished. 

The bathrooms are one of the best parts. We had two in our room. The master being an awesome room that included a huge jacuzzi tub, a separate giant glass enclosed shower, his and her sinks, as well as a commode with a privacy door. The giant mirror that stretches across the bathroom sinks wall had a TV in the middle of it. Everything worked out great. Towels towels and more towels for every part of your body. The robes were also a really nice touch. 

We had 2 separate his and hers closets in our room, and also a dresser and two night tables. Not to mention the bed was so comfy, it made it hard to ever want to get up. I don't know how many geese were used to make this bed set they had, but it was worth every feather. I could have slept for days in that thing. Made me change the way I looked at my bed in my apartment when I returned home. 

The pool deck had a indoor bar and table area. They had big screen TVs with the games on during lunch. Check for pool times during the day, I know they are closed sometimes for cleaning. 


This Hotel is great, it's located right across from a mall, where you can shop or grab food. It's literally right around the corner from the strip. They have shuttles that go to the Wynn. We loved the local spots around us and would have this on the top of our list for next time we return.",3,2,2

But still, it hasn't drawn us in the past. However, this time around, the price was right, especially for a Saturday night in Vegas.

On the surface, it is a very impressive hotel. There are a lot of features that make it very nice. The jet tub was awesome, and the television in the bathroom mirror was unique.

However, once I looked past the initial glitz, it lost some flare for me. For example, the wallpaper in the bathroom was poorly put on. It was bubbling and peeling, particularly in the corners. Yes, this doesn't impact the overall experience. You just expect a little more from a luxury hotel like this.

The pool as nice, at least for families and entertaining. It is small and rectangular. But there is a large shallow entryway on both ends, plus a seating bench that goes along the entire perimeter. And it was already starting to get busy, even at 9am!

Like many of these hotels, valet is required. It was included with our reservation. However, you still need to have tips available for the staff. Unfortunately, I really had to work to get some money one time. The store inside did not allow cash back, so I had to take money out of the ATM inside (which charges a large fee) and then have the store break the $20.

With a family, it is nice to find hotels in Vegas that do not have casinos. I don't mind walking through the casinos. But what we have found is that the lack of a casino greatly reduces the number of people just ""visiting"" the hotel. It cuts down on the traffic inside and around the hotel, which is nice.

Is it worthy of five stars? Heck yes! No doubt. And it's a great value. I've never priced it and found a large suite for less than $100. Do they charge a resort fee? YES! Just like everyone else on the strip. Is it spelled out to you before you sign anything? YES - In big print. And if you know about it and complain about it - what are you doing in a five star resort anyway?

To the good stuff!

Trump was built as a luxury condominium thus it is unique compared to other wonderful resort\/CASINO'S like The Palazzo. Trump is quiet and understated. The suites are decorated in a modern but comfortable motif and include at the bare minimum a kitchenette with imported designer appliances. The beds are HEAVEN too. I found the service to be exceptional and my suite was always spotless when I returned from lunch and shopping. The staff here is what you would expect from a Trump property. Refined, sort of out of sight, but always accommodating.

The bathroom was AWESOME, especially the HDTV built into the mirror.

If you are looking for a pampering yet private escape Trump Las Vegas is your place. I went to rest after a little cosmetic surgery and it was so quite and peaceful you could hear a pin drop. But plastic surgeons always recommend a few hours of gaming each night to reduce the bruising and enhance healing. Like any resort in Las Vegas you have to walk to get to a casino or somewhere good to eat. Or drive yourself, rent a taxi, or use a shuttle. And for snacks you have a kitchen or you can walk to Fashion Show Mall directly across the street.

Lastly - I was on one of the highest floors with a magnificent strip view at no extra cost probably because it was not crowded and money talks. But in any case I DID NOT hear train noises and you would hear a train even 60 floors up. The soundproofing is fine. I also did not hear a peep from the neighbors next door.

And the valet staff was excellent!

My only suggestion to improve this resort would be to spruce up the lobby area a bit. It needs some color or perhaps a chic water-wall. And turn on some music or something so the lobby is inviting and welcoming. It was a bit ""cold"" but that's just my two cents.

Room Tip: High floor of course. Rent a car but remember there is only valet parking.",15,7,6

Just note, of course, that the cheaper price will be giving you a few less amenities than you would at the other Vegas classy establishments.  

The good stuff includes a terrific amount of service all-around (although trying to get my bags took a while for whatever reason on a Sunday afternoon), a really nice room with a small kitchen\/a tub\/a TV in the mirror\/a spacious bathroom\/a sofa + chairs (seems like a mini-suite in a 3 or 4 star hotel) and a pretty nice view.  The elevators are all speedy.  The fitness room is a little small but serviceable.  The pool doesn't seem too shabby being a little higher than the 3rd or 4th floor for a fun view of Las Vegas.  And if you're a big mall fan, Nordstrom\/the Fashion Mall is literally a walk across the street.  Super easy if you don't mind eating some of the mall eateries.  Plus no smoke\/casino if you're not into that.  

Some of the more meh items: Your resort fee is about a good $25+ a day.  You do get good WiFi and access to the pool\/fitness center and a few other things like free water per day.  It does seem a little steep though versus the other resorts (even 3 or 4-star hotels) seem to offer.  Also, the shower was a bit finicky with the water temperature settings along with a door handle that seems to have seen one too many slammed days.  And of course, although it's not a far walk, the closest hotel\/casino is the Wynn\/Encore which is about a 10-minute walk either through the mall or through the dirt road which seems a little weird.  It's also a very close walk to the back parts of Vegas which are a little dirtier to be aware of.  And yeah, that train still is pretty darn close by and loves to toot its horn early in the morning.   

Still, I'm a fan of the hotel and for those looking for a five-star hotel without breaking the bank completely, it's not a bad choice.  Taxi rides are generally about $10-$15 to get to most of the hotels around town and there's even a shuttle\/airport shuttle (just ask for times ahead of time + the airport shuttle is $11).",5,3,1

We booked 2 rooms next to each other with our family arriving the following day. My husband and I were on a work trip and we spent 40minutes carefully checking in and after 40minutes of double checking we thought both bookings were all set!

Then our parents arrived and NO ROOM. THEY GAVE AWAY OUR PARENTS ROOM. The original front desk lady incorrectly flagged our parents to arrive the same day we did and then when they didn't show up the Trump released their room. RELEASED THEIR ROOM!!!

We spent over 4hrs sorting out our reservations - it was dreadful! No compensation - and I was pulled out of a work meeting to sort it out and change rooms. We had to pack and move all our belongings including a crib and all our food and baby gear. When I suggested they ask the people who checked into our in-laws room to move then compensate them with a dinner, the manager on duty refused to call. Nice.

I was assured a manager would call - there was no call. I needed to get back to work so I let the room debacle go.

Oh - they lost our package for hours - it was signed for by a Trump employee at 10:30am and delivered by 6pm! Lol seriously, now that's efficient!

If all of that wasn't bad enough - the following afternoon there was smoke coming through the a\/c. I called the manager Tommie, he was very nice and apologized for all the inconvenience but still no compensation. Nothing. Not a breakfast or a massage - nothing.

Then my in-laws ask for directions to the Children's Museum - the bell desk sent them to THE WRONG ADDRESS!! Nice!

Today I get back to a smoke filled room - this time it was REAL SMOKE. The stove was not locked (we hadn't touched the stove so it wasn't us) but we suspect it had been on low - probably our entire stay. Something was bumped onto the stove and while my son was sleeping the room filled with SMOKE. A security guy alerted my mother-in-law who was monitoring my son from an adjoining room and we pulled him out.

When I came back from work I could smell smoke from the elevators. Another 2hrs + aggravation and we are now moving rooms to sleep because our room is too filled with smoke. 

What a mess. The manager on duty, Victoria was accommodating but I'm still waiting for their gesture of ""we totally messed up your stay here's a ""something"" from us"" it won't change how much time I wasted but at least it would be an effort.

When we walked into the Lobby we were extremely impressed, it was gorgeous!  They pump in floral scents and there are chandeliers and gold everywhere.  But, that was where it ended for us.  The hotel claimed to not have our reservation even though there was a hold placed on my friends credit card.  When they found our reservation they said they would not be able to place us in adjoining suites.  When we argued with the girl she suddenly found two suites for us.  We entered the suites and began looking around.  At first sight the suite was beautiful, then we noticed a weird hissing sound coming from the windows, when we asked the bellhop about it he explained that sometimes the window system that allows fresh air in will break and we might be unable to close it, but he suggested we call the maintenance staff and they would bring us some duct tape to tape over the vent.  Really?  The TV in the living room area did not work and we had to call maintenance to come and fix the TV.  The TV in the bathroom did not work either.  The beds were made, but the carpet was filthy, and there was dirt on the sofas.  There were no extra towels (one bath towel and one hand towel per bathroom in both suites), no extra toilet paper or tissue, and one pillow per pullout sofa.  As we were unpacking one of the housekeeping workers came to the room to apologize for the room being unfinished, she complained to us that it was because ""they called me and told me to stop cleaning"".  I found it unprofessional she would complain to us.  The man who came to clean the carpet (yes, it was bad enough they had to shampoo the carpet) apologized for the room and said it was unacceptable that we were given a room like that.  When one friend who did not drive with us arrived, the valet lost her key.  She handed it to him, he somehow dropped it and he approached her as she checked in and accused her of not giving him the key.  When she was unable to find it in her purse they told her that because SHE lost the key they would need to tow her car at her expense.  They called her a few minutes later in the room to tell us that they found her key on the ground under her car.  Again, no apology for being rude.  The only staff we had contact with that were friendly were the room service staff.  Although we did find it odd that they never once rang the doorbell, they just entered the room.  The good things about the hotel were the lobby, the roomservice (reasonable prices and delicious food), and the free shuttle service.

They offer free parking and valet at a slight cost. We highly recommend the valet because the workers are really quick and attentive. The hotel is fully landscaped very beautifully from the outside and avian very classy decor. 
We were able to check-in within minutes and the front desk gal who helped us, Jenny was very very nice. She had mentioned that they upgraded our one bedroom to the one bedroom superior deluxe suite which was awesome! Please refer to my pictures, our room upgrade was beyond gorgeous. 

As we walked through the hotel lobby to the elevators the decor is just absolutely gorgeous and just classy all around. The hotel also has a distinct yummy smell and just smells fresh.

As we walked into our suite, I was completely taken back, it was huge for my husband and I. There was a kitchen to the right, a dinning table in the center and a huge living room with an awesome view of downtown Lv. Just to the right before heading into the master suite there was a full bathroom that included a shower. 
The master bed was huge. We have a California king at home, so it was nice that the bed reminded us of home- it was super comfy too! 
The biggest surprise was the master bathroom! Again, please check out my pictures, although they don't do justice this was the biggest bathroom I have ever seen in my life! Definitely my dream bathroom! 

Along with your resort fee of $29, they offer a shuttle that takes you to Ceasars Palace which runs every 1 minutes, this is great- saves you money on stupid taxis that over charge.

We were a group of 11 staying at the PH Westgate Towers in a relatively huge suite w\/ common suite amenities (large fridge, bar area w\/ chairs, sink, dishes, etc. etc.). Regardless, I like to have a bed when I am in Vegas. I don't want to sleep on a pull-out, or on the floor, or on a chair. No thanks. 

Cutting to the chase. A friend and I get back to our suite at PH Towers (3:30AM).... beds, pull-outs, and couches are taken. Fuck this. I make my friend get her shit and start calling other hotels. I remember seeing a good rate at Trump a few weeks back and call their 800 number. (On a side note, how bad is AT&T service in Las Vegas?? This almost sabotaged our night.) We call up the Trump and they offer us a solid rate. Much better than the $269 from Bellagio.. 

Quick and fast cab ride around the strip....Enter valet of Trump. Huge chandeliers line the gold ceiling above. To tell you the truth, everything I remember seeing was gold. Obviously over the top but not tacky at all. It was really one of the nicest entrances I've seen in LV. Not too crowded (day or night) and great service. 

Speaking of service.

Did I mention that we were greeted with chilled water bottles at check in? At 4 in the morning? The woman who checked us in also escorted us to the elevators, gave us a detailed description of breakfast options, and explained to us the amenities at our disposal. We get put on floor 25. Awesome room. Awesome view of the strip. Very tasteful decor, huge king bed, big couch area, small kitchenette including sink, mini-fridge, standard utensils, small stove, oven...quite nice. 

Bathroom was huge with TV in mirror and gigantic bathtub. The shower was extremely spacious and the bath products were great smelling (much better than the crap at PH). Really enjoyed the size of the room but I think Trump suffers because they don't have any rooms with two queen beds!!! This is a must. Overall, I was extremely impressed with the rate, service, cleanliness, and roominess of the hotel. The building itself is stunning (coated with real gold) and the rooms are impressive. A great decision for the night... A full weekend next time.",0,0,0

We were on the 34th floor facing north. There's a television in the mirror of the bathroom! The room was super posh - King bed, queen pullout (my friend actually opted to sleep on the couch, as a couch. She promised me it wasn't because I smelled funny... 

Speaking of smells! That spa smell that everyone's talking about? It really exists! It smells really luxurious inside the Trump, for REAL. The dresses I left hanging in the closet smelled so nice after I unpacked them, and even did my sleeping clothes from being in the sheets! A great non-smoking retreat, for sure. Seriously amazing. If you want to smell rich, stay at the Trump! 

As I wanted a chill day with friends, I reserved a poolside cabana for the day - $150, plus a 20% gratuity. The gratuity was worth it; our server, Brittany, was so nice and attentive, I tipped her extra. The TV was a great way to watch the game, and the food from the H2eau cafe (including two pitchers of frozen cocktails), was a perfect way to spend 7.5 hours. The pool is very much a hangout pool. It's not deep, so you can just stand in it and enjoy your drink. However, as the sun starts to set, the adults go inside to prep for a late night, and it gets inundated with splashy kids. 

Late checkout? No problem! (Not for us, at least.) 

It's across the street from Fashion Show Mall, the Nordstrom. You literally just walk across the crosswalk and you're there! 

For $11, you can get direct shuttle service to the airport, every hour on the hour. 

There were a few cons, but nothing to detract. 

The trains do roll through, but they were hardly noticeable for us city folk. If you're from somewhere super quiet, you'd probably get annoyed by this, but then... why are you expecting to sleep in Vegas? 

The sangria was terrible. Stick with hard liquor cocktails. 

It's not right on the strip, so be prepared to take cabs. The shuttle service was woefully inadequate. It never seemed to appear on time, and sometimes it was so full you couldn't get on anyways. 

I would definitely stay again!",7,2,5

The Trump is surprisingly small - there are no restaurants, just a bar area in the front. The check-in reception can be confusing for people since there's no line up structure. I stayed at the King Suite with the Jacuzzi tub on the 19th floor. There is a main door to insert your key card in, that opens up into an open space with two other room doors. I understand this is probably for prevention of hallway noise, but it's not very effective since the doors slam extremely loud and I will always hear my neighbour coming back in\/out. 

They have a gym, pool and spa on the second floor - the resort fees include a $25 voucher to the spa. Aside from that, there are no other amenities or features worth mentioning. The dainty little convenient store by the lobby sells Ivanka Trump shoes, Donald Trump books (the only books on the bookshelf), golf balls and other over priced snacks. 

It is extremely convenient that the Fashion Show Mall is right across the hotel, but I'd still prefer to stay close to the main strip during my next visit. 

The most annoying thing is the train that passes by every few minutes - if you're a light sleeper, be prepared to be woken up at 6:30AM to the lovely sound of the choochoo train. The thermostat in my room also seems to be broken, so I""m always freezing. The bathrobes are amazingly soft and comfortable - I think I might purchase one to take home. 

Overall, this hotel is A-OK for people who don't enjoy gambling and smoke-odor. It's not entirely 'quiet' because of that stupid train, and you'd have to venture elsewhere for dining options.",2,0,0

The only down side is the doors to the room are heavy and noisy so you can hear when your neighbor comes in and out but it could be worse! They also have a great radio\/iPod dock so you can listen to your favorite jams while you get ready for the night. The moderately sized fridge and mini kitchen are also great for pre-partying as is the seating area so everyone can come over.

I arrived at 11:30pm on a Thursday and surprisingly there were 3 agents ready for late comers.  The agent immediately greeted me and asked how my flight was. I like the fact that he walked me to the elevator just to show the way. They put me in the 57th floor with city \/ mountain view. I love the fresh fragrance as soon as you walk in the hotel. Here are the goods (See my pics)

1) Love the double door entrance that reveals 2 separate doors to rooms.
2) The common areas \/ hallways are immaculate. Fresh smell everywhere!
3) Enormous bedroom with king bed, 2 closets, shelves, stove, micro, LCD, fridge, drawers\/ storage galore, utensils, plates, book shelves.
4) Writing desk, separate living area with couch and 2 love seats.
5) Free internet is super fast (included with resort fee)
6) Bathroom is almost the size of a NY efficiency :) Double sinks, marble everywhere, jacuzzi tub (with 3 jet settings...we had fun with this one), separate shower, toilet, and the best is the built in LCD in the mirror (see pic)
7) Had a view of Stratoshpere and mountains...Gorgeous!
8) Love the electronic ""Do Not Disturb"" \/ ""Housekeeping"" button switches cause I always tend to misplace or put the wrong side of the plastic hanging ones...lol
9) Free valet (included with resort fee). It takes only about 5 minutes to get your car. Its just east to leave the car, get out, walk to elevator and be in your room compared to getting lost in the casino and looking up for signs and taking the wrong side of the elevator (I have clearly done this inebriated). There's also plenty of parking across (Fashion Mall) few steps away if you don't want to use valet.
10) Free shuttle to major hotels (City Center, Ceasars, MGM) but you can cut through Fashion Mall and go to Treasure Island , Mirage, take bridge to Palazzo and walking distance to Encore & Wynn.
11) The hotel was hosting a convention but it never felt congested compared to gaming hotels.
12) The pool...wow..love the bar \/ drinks, people and the gym. It's perfect for a quick dip on a hot dessert weather :)

I visit Las Vegas 2x a year not just to gamble, but for the shows and to hang with friends from Cali. I've always stayed at different hotels but this by far is my favorite in my case.

No matter the rest of the experience not much can redeem when it starts off poorly. Immediately I'd choose somewhere else when next in Vegas. Not like there's no choice in this city.

There's no casino, no smoke and the bathroom has a Jacuzzi which was big and the main plus point. From there it goes downhill.

Valet parking would be nice if it wasn't 15-20mins from giving your ticket stub to getting your car. It just doesn't work. Thankfully the mall is just across the road so that's somewhere you can park if you are more in a hurry.

The lobby wasn't bad and there's a nice semi corridor to get to your room. But when you look at the room (perhaps that's not expected) you notice all sorts of wear and tear and you can tell corners have been cut as this alleged 5 star hotel. Gouges in furniture, scratches, wires dangling. Not great.

If you are facing towards Circus Circus then you have another double whammy. The windows are not sound proof enough. You will hear freight trains go by who blast their horns. Then when you want to lie in, the pool music (assuming this is where the noise comes from) also drifts upward and into the room.

CONS
1. Although it was EDC weekend and 2 large conventions in town, the driveway was packed and no one was directing traffic well. I had to ask 3 times for a bell hop to assist our two cars and tons of baggage. It was annoying since we had just driven almost 6 hours to Vegas and all we wanted to do was get into the hotel and out of the 100 degree heat. 

2. One of my friends waiting in the lobby asked a gentleman who worked there where the ladies room was - we had just arrived and it was packed. He rudely told her ""It's over there, see the sign?!"" and gave her a ton of attitude like she was an idiot. She was taken aback. First impressions count and you should treat every guest in a certain manner.

3. Interesting reservation agent helped me. She was not too friendly, I won't give excuses for it being a busy weekend you should always have professional and nice demeanor. 

4. Once in our room, I realized that the 3rd party I booked through had let me book a 2 queen bed suite but this wasn't correct information since we walked in to a 1 king bed\/1 pullout. I called down to the Concierge and inquired about a 2 queen bed room and they simply said they didn't even have those and didn't seem concerned about my inquiry ""since I had booked through a 3rd party"". I don't care who I booked through, I chose to stay at Trump and service shouldn't be lacking because of that. I shelled out big bucks regardless and felt like I was being treated with disdain. Rude.

5. My sister had us booked at the Spa on the Pool Level and we made our way down there for our 5pm massages. Both of the Receptionists looked at us like we were crazy because they had us booked at 6pm. Even though my sister had called and confirmed with them earlier in the day. They said they could only accommodate me at 5pm and my sister at 6pm but she couldn't do it that late since we had a dinner reservation. MIND YOU, my sister is a Spa Director of a hotel in NY so you would think they would try harder to make us happy, but NO, they let her go without a massage and left a bad impression. She was too tired and too nice to complain but I know she was looking forward to it. 

6. Room Service was decent but they took FOREVER to take our plates away after they had set-up dinner in our suite. I had to call down 3 times and after 2 hours they retrieved our dirty dishes. 

7. It took 20 minutes just to get the check paid in the restaurant downstairs. I won't even elaborate on what happened. Just horrible service.

8. SUPER slow WiFi

PROS:
1. After checking into the hotel and feeling drained and annoyed, my friends went downstairs while I was in a massage, and talked to Brady (at Concierge) and explained that it was my birthday and how special this trip was and he gave them a bottle of Veuve Champagne and a decadent slice of amazingggggg chocolate cake for us all to share. He then arranged for the house SUV to shuttle us to the Wynn that night - which was awesome and totally made me happy. He also sent chocolate covered strawberries and a Happy Birthday note to our fridge!!! so at 3am our drunk butts devoured them :) THAT was superb service and he should be friggen promoted after encountering all of the sub-par people at the hotel this weekend.

2. The Suites themselves are amazing. Big living area and kitchen stocked FULL of amenities for every need. The bathrooms were very spacious and had great Spa amenities. Everything was extremely clean. Comfy bed!

3. Service was spectacular in regards to requesting champagne glasses, extra plates, extra towels, cleaning, etc. Very fast and friendly. 

4. The pool area was fun on Saturday - we decided to splurge on a sofa bed next to the pool and everyone was SO nice - we had a great server and all of the pool boys helped us with umbrellas and extra towels all day long. Also, they had a small DJ set up...he played great music. The pool was small in comparison to other hotels but it was just right- not too crazy and overlooked the Strip.

5. Food was great downstairs at the one restaurant\/bar and at the pool. The room service dinner menu was just OK. Big portions and well-priced throughout the hotel. Try the Bloody Mary at the pool - so good! 

6. Quiet hotel, very few noises for how crazy of a weekend it was. I think my group was the loudest- sorry #notsorry. 
 
7. Very nice Spa and massage. 

I don't think I'll be staying at Trump again which is sad because it is a BEAUTIFUL hotel, quiet, clean, and very relaxing (at times). But the service was so inconsistent that it really bothered me and my friends.

Yes the lobby and rooms are clean and pretty. But the floor to ceiling windows are made of cheap, thin glass. I was on on the 56th floor and could literally hear every car that went by. I asked for a quiet room having read reviews from people complaining about the noise, and this was the best they could do. You hear planes beginning at 6 am and trains at 7:30 am. So much for a relaxing weekend away! Odd that I have NEVER heard a plane in a Vegas hotel room and I've been here hundreds of times.

The bartender downstairs also refused to sell me their turkey burger which is supposed to be good. He said I'd have to get room service to get it. Uhhhh...aren't you people all using the same kitchen???? Also note that the burger isn't listed on the room service menu.

Thomas in the front (maybe bellman and taxi?) was extremely rude. He paused in the middle of responding to my question to flirt with a group of girls and completely forgot what we were discussing.

Bad:

5. They don't have rooms with two beds. The second bed is a pull out sofa. It's an old, uncomfortable, thin mattress. They should be embarrass that they offer this. It's such an elegant hotel and it doesn't really represent ""Trump"" . Or maybe it does?
6. Hotel is away from the strip. You have to take a shuttle that stops running at 12pm.
7. There is no casino.",1,0,0

The interior is amazing, and the part I liked best about this hotel was that it is not a casino hotel, so there is not the constant beeping and blaring of noises and lights from the obnoxious slot machines. It is very quiet, calm and serene as soon as you walk in the lobby.

The staff are very nice and friendly, as well as helpful. The rooms are beautiful and luxurious.

So why the 3 star rating? Well, every time we called down for something - extra towels, a hair dryer (which should have been in the room in the first place), sewing kit, etc - we had to call down twice. Additionally, the pull out bed is probably the most uncomfortable bed I've ever slept on. Definitely not what I'd expect from a Trump Hotel.

Having said that, the front desk staff did comp me two days of daily service charges because of having to call down twice about everything and the shuttle drivers are extremely friendly and helpful.

Wish this were a bit closer to the strip, but hey, it was a good deal. I'd go again in the off season.",0,0,0

I feel very fortunate to have stayed here, even though it was only for one night. The service was top notch from start to finish, from the valet to the lobby staff. They made us feel welcome at all times and service was always fast, from bringing up the luggage to retrieving our car. 

The room was incredible. We had the ""cheapest"" room available, which is quite a steal during the weekdays, but we never felt like we had anything less than first class the whole time. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was enormous, and it was nice to have a door around the toilet. The most unique thing, that I've never seen in any other hotel because it's considered an ""unnecessary"" luxury, is that they utilize soft water in the sinks and showers. This a high quality extra that is so effective in preventing dryness in your skin. I was so surprised because this is an extra cost for them, for the pure benefit of their guests, and many guests probably don't even realize they have it. I'm aware of the difference in how it feels because I used to pay extra for tanks of soft water to be installed in my shower and I had forgotten how much I miss it. 

My husband and I did a little walking around. The pool area and gym were so nice, we wished we could have stayed longer to take advantage of them. Everything shimmers of gold so we had fun taking pictures all around. We even wandered into an open meeting room. High class everywhere we looked. I highly recommend staying here - there wasn't one complaint or problem and we hated to leave. I do hope to return if I'm in the area again.",4,2,2

+ Las Vegas
+ Trump International Hotel
=Best weekend evarrrrr!

The Trump is my favorite place to stay in Vegas thus far. My girlfriends and I stayed in a suite this past weekend and while I'm sure pleasing six ready-to-drink-and-party, friends-since-high-school girls isn't too difficult, we really enjoyed every minute of our visit.

It's not directly on the strip but RIGHT off of it, behind the Fashion Show Mall. It also doesn't have a casino! This was a plus for me, because Vegas isn't a place you spend a lot of time in your hotel room, but when you do, you need some calm and quiet. I hate walking through loud and smokey casinos at 5 in the morning after a night of drinking, dancing, and all around debauchery, and all I want is to rest my head against something and close my eyes.

The suites are fairly large, with a little kitchen and a pull out couch. The bathrooms are awesome - they have a huge shower, a phone next to the crapper and a TV built into the mirror. MTV cribs status. Definitely felt like I was ballin' outta control.

We had a view of the pool, which was never crowded at all. I didn't use it myself because I'm a vampire, but my girlfriends enjoyed it. It's huge and there is plenty of seating. There was none of this beach club craziness with empty beer bottles and an island of puke floating around in the deep end. Although, there was a mermaid swimming around in it on Saturday. Yeah, a mermaid, with a tail and everything. Don't ask me.

We ordered room service on Saturday and the food came up quickly, within about 20 minutes just like they said. And it wasn't ridiculously priced, which was a plus. The valet and housekeeping staff were were all very nice as well. I would definitely stay here again. +1 for the Donald!",2,1,4

While I think Las Vegas is a fine little city, I don't particularly like the Strip. But, sometimes business calls and you do what you need to do. When you need to be on the Strip, you can do far worse than the Trump. Donald Trump's Hotel...if you have to go to Las Vegas, for me, it's either this one or the Four Seasons (but the Trump is closer to more of the ""attractions"" of Las Vegas).
The Trump is everything The Donald says he wants his hotel to be, luxurious, gold, spectacular, understated, gold, elegant, world class, gold, lavish, sumptuous and of course, gold.
I really do like the Trump (I kid because I love). The service is everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel; there is no casino to fight your way through to get to the elevators to your room (although there is a guard in the elevator lobby to make sure that only guests get in, thank you!); the Trump is non-smoking so...kudos!
Most importantly, the Trump really is a quality, luxury hotel! They treated us like royalty, from the moment we walked in until the moment we left. They upgraded us to very nice suite, no charge (really nice touch), they remembered our names, they talked to us like people (not walking tip machines), and made us feel welcome and comfortable.
First, the room...a beautiful suite with a view out to the strip (the Trump is about 2 blocks off the strip, but a nice view anyway). The suite was decadent. Huge, with a living room, formal dining room and service kitchen, and full master suite for the bedroom (and a steam shower, with multiple shower heads) and in a particularly nice touch, a TV hidden in the bathroom mirror, including a remote that you can use from the huge and luxurious spa\/tub. The furnishings are on a par with any very nice home.
Next, the ambiance...relaxed, open, friendly and calming (again...no casino...hurrah!). You can have a cocktail in the lobby bar or by the pool and feel both pampered and comfortable at the same time. I will review the restaurants in another review, but they are terrific and by extension, the room service was outstanding.
Finally, the service...absolutely first rate! It's deferential, but not cloying or overbearing. Everyone from the general manager to bellmen and room service waiters acknowledged us and called us by name (never ""you guys"" or anything remotely like it...not allowed as we discovered from one of the pool attendants). They offered free limo's up and down the strip, to get us to dinner's, etc. I felt like a high roller in spite of the fact that I never gamble more then $2-300 when I'm in Las Vegas (do you suppose that's why I never get anything comped?).
The Trump is a terrific place to stay in Las Vegas. It is, in a word Trumpulescent.",6,5,7

My hair has never been better and I can't wait to get my hands on one...it puts my T3 to shame.   

This was a Priceline deal, $117 a night to celebrate my sister's 40th bday.  We went to see Bette Midler and relax and play some penny slots.  

The Trump hotel was all I expected it to be with gold here and sparkles there and random horse head statue on the desk in the room....  

The resort fee is nothing short of majorly lame....but considering that you can probably get a really cheap rate for the room, you can just add it to the cost and still have a decent price per night.  The funky crowd at the pool is proof of the bargain rates.....but this gal likes a bargain too so I can't fault anyone else now, can I? :)",3,1,3

Feeling a little stir crazy in the OC during MLK weekend we decided to mosey on down Vegas last minute.  I couldn't believe for the weekend I was going to get  less than $150 a night, but the Trump didn't let me down.  I had heard good things from friends before, but being a loyal middle of the strip kinda girl I was a little concerned with the trek we were going to have to do (especially since the new Cesears buffet was on our minds).  But I booked Trump, and am so glad I did.  From the moment we walked into the lobby I was blown away.  I am SO happy there isn't a casino, helps me save a little $ to gamble downtown.  But we truly blew me away was the customer service.  Don't believe other reviewers, vallet is included in your stay.  Everyone was amazing there, my bf told me he had never been treated this well at any other hotel.

Now the room...AMAZING!  The views were fantastic and i don't think I can do Vegas without a (mini) fridge again.  No more stuffing one of the sinks with ice for my beer again!  Also tv in the bathroom, was convient considering how long it takes me to do my hair and for soaking my sore body after using the included with your fees gym.  

Speaking of the gym, I loved it.  I know its super tiny, but at least they have weights compared to the tiny cardio room at the MGM.

But oh yea, about the trek from the Trump, they offer complimentary suttles to the Wynn and Ceasear's (service is cut off at certain times, I think 12am, and 10pm respectfully) but hey, after partying you'll probably take a cab, right!

Now the few downsides:

-the pool is tiny, it's nice, but MGM, Mandalay, all kick this pool's tush.  Probably when I'm going to Vegas with my girls in the middle of the summer to party, this won't be the place
-the bed: not horrible, but not as comfortable as the Palazzo, Wynn or MGM

yup...that's about it.

I am not a big gambler and smoker so this hotel is perfect!  It is a little far off the strip but it is right next to the mall!  Upon arrival, we did valet (only option) and our bags were loaded on and ready to go.  Called before hand to see if we could check in (3pm check-in) but they said we had to do it at 3.  When we got there (around 2:30), we were able to check in and swim!  The pool was nice.  Not too crowded like other places where you can barely move anywhere!  Drinks were pricey too!  

The hotel is super nice.  Big bathroom with a shower, toilet, jet tub, and a TV built into the mirror.  Loved watching TV while doing some business ;)  First night, had a great night sleeping in the most comfortable beds ever!! 

Onto the 3 star review...after swimming at the pool on our second day, we decided to use the jet tub in the bathroom.  Turned on the water until it was full and turned on the jets.  Slowly getting in, it felt so good until something started spewing out of the jets.  Some kind of green foamy algae vommity type substance.... (GROSS!).  Maybe it was just something that was in the drain so my bf and i started scooping it out and throwing it on the bathroom towel that was on the floor....5 minutes of scooping was ridiculous so we decided to call the front desk and tell them about our problem.  Long story short, it took about 45 minutes to resolve this thing with waiting and talking and waiting and talking...etc.  This substance has never been seen before and we were in a hurry to get somewhere else.  They said they would put some tablets in there but I really needed to shower and go somewhere!  They SHOULD have offered an alternative such as giving us another room to shower or SOMETHING!  To solve this problem, they offered free breakfast, day spa passes, or  $75 credit. We really couldn't use the spa passes since we were leaving the next day, so they were nice enough to deduct our resort fee for 2 rooms that we booked.

Also, our remote didn't work in the bathroom.  We turned on the tv and that worked but later, around 12:00am, it wouldn't turn off.  My bf tried to switch the batteries from the outside room to the bathroom but still, we couldn't turn off the tv and it was blasting really loud!  Called the desk and they said they would send someone right up.  10 minutes later, a guy comes up and ask....""uh do you want me to get someone for you?""  UH YEAH!!! that's why we called!!!  ""UH what do you want me to do?""  ""Do anything you can to turn off this damn TV!""  Wow.....

Overall good hotel, except for that incident.  If that hadn't happened along with slow service, I might come back.

You can walk to Fashion Show Mall (Nordstrom entrance) in less than a minute once you leave the front lobby. The walk to the strip isn't bad, either - five to ten minutes depending on traffic lights.

- No smoking anywhere. No small thing for a Vegas hotel.

- Next to the mall

The bathroom is almost as big as some motel rooms I've stayed in. You get a jacuuzi bath and a huge shower. In mirror tv, double sinks, just fabulous, oh and nice robes to wear after the awesome bath.
The rest of the place was great too, kitchenette with high end appliances, dishes, pots, pans, basically everything you'd need to cook anything you want, if you're not too busy going out to fancy restaurants.
The bed was super comfy, and we slept well every night, except for the freaking train that comes by several times a night. After the first night though the train is a lot less noticeable for some reason.
There was plenty of seating, had we wanted to have any guests over.
This place is about details, you get little bottles of water everyday, and there are funky sculptures on the shelves, and even some art books to look at. Nice flat screen tv with tons of channels of course.
Going back to the room was a very relaxing experience, and a nice getaway from all the flashing lights and noise in the casinos and on the strip.

I guess the annoying things were that you have to pay $15 a day extra for a ""resort fee"" but whatever, it's really not that much. 
Mandatory valet parking was something that took some getting used to, although they were always pretty quick to get our car, so I can't complain too much.
We also really did not like the ""DJT"" restaurant. It was very overpriced for ok food, especially breakfast. Luckily it was being paid for by someone else. For dinner I did not order a starter, but by the time my entree came an hour and a half later, I was practically starving, and although the steak was good, it wasn't worth that much of a wait. Slow and overpriced.

We would definitely go here again, given that we found a good deal on hotwire (you can tell which hotel it is because it is the non-smoking 5 star condo on the strip).",0,0,0

Pros:
-The best thing about the Trump is that it's not a casino. So it automatically feels more classy and clean. 
-Our check-in and -out processes were painless. The staff were super nice and polite during our whole visit.
-We were upgraded to a suite which, honestly, the most luxurious hotel room I've ever been in. The bathrooms got me speechless. Huge bath\/hot tube, huge shower, and a make up table. What else could I ask for?
-It wasn't very busy at the pool when we were there.
-Booked through AA vacation and got a really good deal, for a 5-star hotel.

Cons:
-It's kinda far from the center of the strip. It takes a 10 minute walk to get to the Wynn and Encore (i walk slow) or $8 cab to get to Ceasar Palace. They do have shuttles that run to these two areas but you have to wait quite a bit, and the service stops at early hours (before midnight).
-The pool is sort of boring (compared to other Vegas pools). The little hot tub next to the pool is a bit yucky, they should just cover that thing up.",0,0,0

The pool is like a garden oasis. The lifeguard was very attentive and came over and adjusted our umbrella for us. This was so nice.
This is a valet only property but they are pretty fast. I think they could improve by making specific lanes for valet, taxis, and shuttles. 
Also the housekeepers need to tighten up a bit. There was an Advil on our floor when we arrived. Also a travel size bottle of something on the floor under the sink in the bathroom. Hopefully it won't be there when you check in.
But beyond that A++ from me.

Over our 8 years of marriage the Trump has been our go-to and never disappoints! Prior to check-in we requested a one-bedroom suite with Chelsea who was so gracious in accommodating, even at 102% capacity.

Upon arriving we immediately were welcomed by two friendly faces in Armando and Lamont who work valet. Without hesitation, Armando remembered my wife's name and we quickly caught up as he has been assisting us for 8 years (Lamont 6). They helped us inside where we were greeted by Christian at the front desk. He's extremely professional and very kind as he helped us extensively throughout our last stay in February. After further checking the inventory, he was able to give us an incredible deal on a Penthouse suite!! We were ecstatic and could not wait to see the room. After about two hours which allowed for a full cleaning, I received a phone call that the room was ready. Once we entered we realized we would never want to leave! The view was INCREDIBLE with a huge living room that boasts floor-to-ceiling windows. You could see the entire strip and watch planes take off and land at the airport. We literally were mesmerized for the first hour as we could not get over the room and view. The bathroom was also a thing of beauty. The sunken jacuzzi tub and walk-in shower were enormous an incredibly relaxing.  Christian even called up to the room after an hour to ask if everything was OK and if we needed anything... in all honesty we were truly in paradise and were lacking nothing!

The next day we went to soak up a little time in the pool. I am in a wheelchair and so we were not exactly sure how it would work. Cheyenne, the pool manager, was incredibly helpful and insisted that she would grab a strong worker to aid my wife with transfers. A few moments later we were introduced to Daniel who helped us in and out of the pool. Without his assistance there would have been no relaxing outside as temperatures quickly exceeded 100!

Throughout our entire stay everyone was incredibly helpful and offered assistance at the drop of a hat. Our last day there Armando had scheduled a wheelchair taxi to get us back to the airport. Unfortunately the driver had been involved in an accident and was a no-show. Cesar came to our rescue and braved the heat by standing in the street for 30 minutes until he could secure us an accessible taxi. We made our flight but only because of his dedication and incredible service!

We are grateful to the staff of the Trump for making our stay unforgettable! We look forward to making many new memories in the months and years to come!",0,0,0

First, our room was reedonkulus.  They upgraded us for free to a 1 bedroom suite.  Huge, immaculately clean room.  The living room had it's own full bath with shower.  The master bath had a huge jacuzzi bath that was cleaned to a spit shine.  I like cheesiness, so the TV embedded in the mirror got me.  I like the ""Cribs"" factor.  Also a main reason to go here is that it's completely non-smoking.  The air in most Vegas hotels gives my wife asthma and sets off my allergies bigtime. Here, the air is scented with some nice perfume (not old grandma but more like some kind of faint lavender).  I also like the fact that coming home drunk doesn't instantly guarantee me losing all that's left in my wallet on the casino floor.  I think the fact that they don't have a casino makes them more likely to want you to stay in your room, at the pool, etc.  Anyways, spent quite a few hours by their pool getting mojitos and listening to classic 80s and some hip hop.  Pretty good scene.   For the priceline tag of $150, can't beat it.",0,0,0

I loved it so much I want to BUY one of the units.  (Didn't I hear one of the towers is comprised of units for sale?!)

Trying to save cash, we opted for a city view studio. $120\/night with a $50 spa credit.  The spa credit was supposed to be for one night only, but I flirted with the guy at the desk and he credited us twice!!  (It's cool, the hub's OK with it... he's a cheapskate.  Anything to save a couple $$.)  Oh, AND we got complimentary late check-out til 4pm.

The bed, amazing.  Not too soft, not too firm.  But that's objective.

The bathroom: INCREDIBLE.  Marble, floor to ceiling.  14"" TV screen seamlessly embedded in the GIANT mirror.  Huge spa tub with 3 jet settings. (Which somehow, when you fill it, turns the water blue-ish...nice touch.)  There are separate toilet & shower 'stalls' with floor-to-ceiling glass doors, too. LOVE THIS BATHROOM.  Did I mention it's just a smidge larger than MY BEDROOM at home?!?!

Customer service in the lobby was mediocre, except for my exceptional desk service ;)   Valet and bell service was friendly.  Pool service was GREAT.  Those pool girls work hard taking orders, mingling with the grey-chest-haired, uber fried (I mean, tanned) creepers, and serving up all the refreshing drinks and yummy food... all in bikini tops and Juicy pants!  

Speaking of the pool, it's a bummer that it's so small.  And just watch out for the reflective glare of the gold windows... it's like a second sun!!

About the location... it's directly across from the Wynn, and for 26-year old normal, healthy young adults, the walk from the front door to the Strip was only 3 minutes.  During the daytime, you could even take a shortcut through Nordstrom and cut another minute off (or, if you're like me, add 30 minutes to the walk by shopping......)

Anyway - I LOVE Vegas and next time I go with the hubster, we will definitely return to the Trump!!",1,1,1

What I liked:
The check-in process was painless and fast. The friendly worker offered water bottles and even walked us to the elevator.
The king bed had comfy mattress.
The bathroom was super roomy with a bathtub, an enclosed shower and an enclosed toilet.
TV in the bathroom on the mirror.
Kitchen with refrigerator, microwave and toaster. Lol toaster? Do I need to bring my own bread?
Bathroom scale in the bathroom. Hey, at least you know your weight before & after the buffets jk
Super powerful hair dryer.
Magnifying make-up mirror.
Robes inside the closet. I didn't get to use it though.
It is located right across the Fashion Show mall.

What I didn't like:
Our lamp was missing a knob. We couldn't turn on the light and had to call the front desk to fix it.
We couldn't lock the door because the door wasn't aligned right.
The water pressure was low.
The soft water was weird. I kept rinsing my hands  because they felt sticky after using the soap. The same thing happened when I took a shower and washed my hair 
The light on top of the kitchen cabinet wasn't installed correctly.
One of the security guards near the elevator was rude. The other security guards and workers were super nice.
It is on the strip, but still too far to walk to the other 5 stars hotels with casinos.

Our room was not ready so they took our bags and let us know they would call us when our room was ready.  They even kept our beer cold while we waited.  We headed to the mall which was across the street for a bite to eat while we waited for our room.  We were expecting a couple hours before our room was ready but they call only a half hour later letting us know they had our room ready.  After we picked up our room card and luggage we opened the door to a CLEAN, spacious suite.  Kitchen had dishwasher, blender, SubZero fridge, high end stove and microwave.  Bottles of water, Tazo tea, Starbucks coffee and everything you would need to cook and eat a meal are also provided.  The pool area was clean.  The staff at the pool took care of us but food and drink took a while.  I know there was only one bartender and taking care of the whole pool area is a lot for him to do all by himself.  The spa was outstanding as well.  Sauna, steam room, showers and a gym were all close to the pool area.  The only thing I can say that could be better is the room we were in was the Southwest corner of the hotel.  There are train tracks that run along the West side of the hotel.

When we were checking in, the front desk was very generous and upgraded us to a corner suite instead of the regular suite.

The main lobby is simply beautiful, with gold decor, crystal clear chandeliers, and pretty flowers. The main restaurant is on one side of the lobby, across from the check-in counter, and the main walkway leads you to the elevators.

What's great (or not great, depending on your preference) about Trump Hotel is that it doesn't have a casino. The casinos are nearby (such as Wynn, Encore, etc.) but Trump Hotel stands out in that it doesn't own their own casino. Hubby and I personally liked this, because it made the hotel feel like a real luxury hotel, and also family-friendly. There was no cigarette\/tobacco smell in the air, the children didn't need to walk through gambling headquarters, and overall, the hotel seemed more high-class.

What hubby and I both found very interesting was how there were another set of doors that led us to our hotel suite. I believe this is only for suites; at least that's how it's listed on the hotel's website. You know how there is a separate Do not Disturb sign that you can hang on your room's main door? At Trump, this was totally not the case. As you can see above, there are two lights that can come up: Housekeeping and Do not Disturb. Inside your hotel room, you can manage these settings and ask for privacy or housekeeping at your leisure. I found this very easy to use and quite efficient; you'd never lose the Do not Disturb sign because it's already built in! The technology also brings a sense of luxuriousness as well.

Because it was a corner suite, it was a bit bigger than the traditional one bedroom suites. The entire suite had a traditional classic feel to it with modern decor that made the suite feel very chic and beautiful.

What we also really appreciated was the kitchen that the suite came with. Many of Trump's hotels are actually residences as well, so for those with extended stays, this kitchen will become extremely useful. Though it was not fully furnished with cutlery, plates, and etc. it was stated that it could be furnished to your desire upon request. All the appliances were high quality and top-notch, from brands such as Bosch, Wolf, and Sub-Zero. We didn't use the kitchen during our stay, but hubby and I both agreed that it would be very handy and useful if we were travelling with a newborn; sometimes finding a place to prepare your baby's milk and food can be troubling! No problem here at Trump Hotel though.

Aside from the kitchen, the bottled water and coffee available in the room were complimentary. Both the water and coffee are unlimited at Trump Hotel, as they are covered in your mandatory resort fee. When requested, the hotel will bring you more water\/coffee at your service. The resort fee, which is $32.48 USD\/night is a little more pricey than your other Las Vegas hotels and resorts, but it includes many more services for the price, including: valet parking, in-room coffee, in-room bottled water, shuttle service, pool access, fitness centre access, internet access, newspaper, phone calls, faxes, and other additional services.

In between the kitchen and the living room was two doors: one leading us to our bedroom and another leading us to the second bathroom. This bathroom was separate from the bathroom in our master bedroom. The second bathroom was fully equipped with a shower stall ready for use. The marble floors were amazing and so luxurious, and everything was so clean! I didn't know that the suites came with two bathrooms, but I was very grateful that we did!

When hubby and I stepped into our bedroom, we were so surprised by many things, and here are just some of them:
(1) the beautiful master bathroom
(2) floor-to-ceiling windows that gave us a phenomenal view of The Strip
(3) comfortable King bed - comfortable is an understatement
(4) the high-quality closets.

Our stay at Trump International Hotel Las Vegas was quite short (only 2 nights), but they were some of the best times we've had during our summer vacation. Everything we needed was already available or only one phone call away. We loved our stay at Trump Hotel and would come back here in a heart beat.

The booking was simple and easy. Beware of the elevator by the way, it's freaking crazy. It's so fast and your ears pop instantly and when you're hungover it's kind of not good for you. The rooms are two together, and there's actually a outerdoor with a doorbell and then once you're past that there's the two doors for each suite. Each room was really spacious, with a king bed, a couch and sitting area, a tiny kitchenette with AMAZING starbucks cafe verona, and a huge bathroom! There's a tub with jets and a little tv in the middle of the mirror. (This proved to be incredibly distracting while getting ready). During my one night stay I took two baths, take advantage of their tubs. Overall, it was amazing to get back to a quiet, clean, classy hotel after all the shenanigans in the other hotels. There's no smoking (though someone previously definitely didn't follow those rules in our room), and no casino. There's also nothing to really look at in the hotel, so no visitors, etc just people who are literally staying here. An interesting thing was, one of our closets were locked, and turns out the ""owner"" puts their shit in there while he's gone\/and the room is rented. I guess they were supposed to be all condos but it didn't sell enough.

There are some flaws, but they make up for it in effort. The most glaring was the valet situation. There is no self park, and the driveway is kind of narrow, so giving our valet to the car took a long time, and getting our car back after check out took forever. (Beware of these times since a bunch of people check out at once, so the valet is overcrowded. But they seriously RUN and work hard so tip them well) 

Overall, a very pleasant surprise, if you're 21 and want to stay out til 6am don't come here, if you want to have fun then come back at a reasonable hour and get some rest stay here. Also families and children welcome, there won't be drunken girls half naked so it's all very PG13.",9,1,5

We received a very thoughtful handwritten note at check-in, we chose to upgrade to a one bedroom suite for a nominal amount and we were soooo glad we did. Wow! What a view of the strip we had! The room was spotless, the turn-down service was appreciated and wonderful (they even turned on relaxing classical music for us). There is a television WITHIN the bathroom mirror - it was amazing! We used the pool & jacuzzi and found both to be clean and the pool deck cleanliness to be maintained properly. We ordered a drink each ($14 per drink) - they were delicious! We wanted to have some friends up for cocktails so we asked for the glasses\/dish\/pan set to be delivered to our room, it was there within 5 minutes. :) The Valets were friendly and courteous. We're always a bit nervous having our new car valeted; however, we looked our car over each time and saw no damage so that was good! We ate the breakfast buffet (about $22\/pp) twice and loved it! The hot food was freshly made and well stocked, but the best part of the buffet (in my opinion) was the fresh fruit. Wow! Absolutely perfect mixed berries, strawberries, cantaloupe, watermelon...mmmmmm! TIP: You may also ask for toast and they'll make it just for you. The Fitness Center was clean and very busy. It's got free weights, machines, treadmills, ellipticals, bikes - something for everyone. The complimentary shuttle will take you to either Wynn OR Caesar Palace's Forum Shops. The drivers were friendly, courteous, and safe. Shuttles run until midnight. ** BONUS TIP: Trump price-matches hotel rates so if you find a better rate somewhere else, give them a call and they'll match the price. Benefit to that is that then you earn reward points, get better chance of getting free upgrades, etc. - HIGHLY recommend!! And, it was the BEST price on the strip during our time (by at least $50 per night)!

The Trump hotel is located fairly close to the strip but not exactly walking distance to the heart of the strip but there are many cabs, Uber's, lyfts and even their own shuttle that runs until midnight completely complimentary that will get you there and back!

The hotel is absolutely stunning! As we pulled up we were kindly and warmly greeted by the bellman which isn't a thing I'm used to seeing so much anymore. He held the door and even offered to carry out bags! Now that's service!

The gorgeous lobby is decorated with such high class! Lots of marble, fresh cut flowers, gorgeous crystal chandeliers and curtains! The gal at check in was super sweet and took care of us right away.

After checking in we headed to the elevators which is guarded by security, he checks for your key as you walk up! We entered the gorgeous wood grained elevators to our floor. Entering into our room we had a full kitchen, living room and 2 bathrooms with a master suite overlooking the fashion show mall and treasure island. The room was stunning and nothing was cheap! Except for the free water bottles which is always a plus. I loved that there was a fridge and coffee maker. Made our vacation that much sweeter where we had found a home away from home.

The shuttle service was excellent if you don't mind waiting around for it! They come every 15 minutes and take you to the Wynn and Cesar's Palace where they also take you back to Trump! Our shuttle drivers were all very nice and professional. They also were super informative!

1) There was some weird issue with our phone system where the phone light blinked for three days straight.

It was a busy weekend and the rates looked attractive for a 5-star property.  I really regret not going with Venetian instead since it was only slightly more.  

To preface, I actually don't hate on Trump.  I rather enjoy his Apprentice show and most of his dealings, so I was very open minded staying at Trump for the first time.  But fact remains that this was a really subpar experience.


First, location was horrible.  

Our taxi drove us in, and you get off the freeway to see the row of strip clubs before arriving at the Trump hotel.  The location is offstrip even though it looked pretty near on Google Maps.  It's a ten minute walk to the Wynn which is on the Northern end of the strip.  They have a shuttle to Wynn and Caesar's, but it's not very convenient especially if you want to take a break in your room mid-day.  

Worse, one side of the tower faces the Railroad track.  If you're a light sleeper, don't bother; it's pretty loud.  I couldn't believe the rep I spoke with just dismisses it like it's normal.  She told me to book the room on the other side next time I stay.  So 50% of the hotel experience the train multiple times a night... really?


Second, while the resort fee is quite standard now in Las Vegas, the amenities that came with it were disappointing (wifi, shuttle, water).  Oh, and pool access too.  Except that during my stay the pool was up for ""renovation"" for December.  This is fine and understandable, but what was insulting was the note to tell guests to buy a $10 voucher to use Caesar's Palace pool (and ride their free shuttle there!)  

I can't imagine having your five star hotel guests to pay for a ticket to use another hotel's pool while being shuttled back and forth.  If you claim that pool access is part of the resort fee, then at least provide complimentary tickets on request.  It's almost comical.


Finally, the overall staff and experience of the hotel is far from a true 5 star hotel.  It's 4 stars at best.  Everyone from doorman, shuttle driver, front desk.  None of them really understand how to delight the customer.  They're just doing their job day in and day out.  The shuttle drives around the hotel to stop at next pickup, instead of letting you off at the hotel entrance first.  The doorman opens the door but no one offers to help with the bags.  The concierge won't help get you change but have you wait ten minutes for a front desk agent.  Many many more examples lead me to believe that the staff isn't trained at the same expectations at other 5 star hotels.


I could go on, but you get the point.


The Good:
- Smoke free hotel

The Bad:
- Location is off-strip, ten minutes walk to the Wynn.  The ride there passes through the strip clubs.
- On the back side of the tower you hear the train multiple times a day.
- Staff (shuttle, front desk, bellman) are all less experienced.  They are courteous, but really rough around the edges that you wouldn't expect from a 5-star hotel.
- No customer support.  I emailed some of my concerns in this review to them and never got a response back.


Overall this is far from a 5-star experience.  Their rooms and suites are discounted for a reason.  In retrospect, I'd rather pay a bit more to stay at Venetian or Bellagio.  I would never stay at Trump again.",5,2,0

The rooms are very pretty and the bathrooms are very nice. Everything is clean. We booked on a priceline deal and you need to be aware that they do charge a daily resort fee of about $30 on top of whatever you paid thru priceline. That is my biggest gripe - but that is not the hotel's fault.

Each room has a pull out bed, as well, so you can actually fit a lot of people in there. And I was so impressed by the closet space! 

The best part about the Trump is that it includes a 4pm checkout time all the time, at no extra charge. I can't stress how important that is after a night out in Vegas!

I stayed here for my 21st birthday trip and was so happy with this facility. Here are my pros and cons if you are looking to stay here:

Pro:
GREAT PRICE...(found on Hotwire.com) $124 per night on a weekend.

Premium rooms with all the bells and whistles. (including full kitchen)
I would compare to its luxury to the Bellagio or Venetian.

The most comfortable bed I have slept in!

Con: 
NOT AS CLOSE TO THE STRIP AS YOU THINK...It looks closer than it is, but that walk will will you. Its about 1\/4 mi block from encore, and then to go down the strip is even more walking...then you have to walk back! 

Pool wasnt spectacular.

No casino.

Stayed here for a week during New Years. The staff is attentive but not invasive. Service staff kept a professional, but light tone with me during check in. I noticed some subtle things: they really know how to treat their Asian guests. They weren't overt or abrasive about it (if they said Ni Hao I would have laughed) but they always handed me things with two hands; had crisp dollar bills whenever I asked for change; and somehow never intruded in my personal space, yet kept me happy the entire time I was there. No idea how they did that. Oh, and they employ house elves because I never once saw a housekeeping cart or staff, yet my bed was always made. Awesome. 

The room was excellent, with a fully stocked kitchen (you can call ahead and have it stocked with food if you'd like), large shower and jacuzzi tub (that can fit more than a couple of people inside), and large living space\/king size bed\/study area. This is the studio that I've been looking for to live in on a regular basis. We watched the fireworks in my room after the Strip got too crazy. I had a perfect view of the 8 minute fireworks show from my room; what a great way to ring in the new year. 

The slightly off-strip location is a bit annoying for me. The shuttle ends at midnight on weekdays and 2AM on Fridays and Saturdays. I usually tip shuttle drivers well and ask for their cell phone numbers so that I don't have to pay for taxis. That strategy didn't work for New Years since the traffic was so intense after the police closed the strip. On the other days, the shuttle is fine but they rotate the shuttle drivers a lot so its hard to maintain contact with any one particular driver. The shuttle drives you to Encore or to the back of the Forum Shops (where all the fancy shops are, in the back of Caesar's Palace). Its a long walk to any where you are going on the Strip. 

One other thing: you'll pay a $25 resort fee, but its worth it. You get free wireless access (really fast connection, about 1Mbps download) and access to fitness center. Their room service isn't too expensive either. I bought a couple of bottles of wine with me but there's a liquor store that has a decent selection nearby. 

Bottom line: if you enjoy a ""nice"" hotel that's slightly off the strip and away from the center of activity and action, you'll enjoy Trump. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.",0,0,0

Great room.  I completely prefer rooms with a kitchenette or at least a fridge.  And since I was here for 4 nights, the set up at the trump was key.  Fridge, sink, stove top if you want it and microwave.  Beyond that the room is also a nice space, with a comfortable bed and good work area.  As mentioned by at least one other reviewer, the shower door situation is a little funky.  That probably could have been designed better.

Great fitness center.  There are a number of treadmills facing the pool area and a decent assortment of machines, too.  

Super convenient to be across from that mall.  Walk through Nordstrom and you've got yourself a Chipotle no more than 300 yards from front door of the hotel.  

Short walk to El Segundo Sol and StripBurger.

Short taxi lines.  I was here 4 nights and in and out multiple times per day.  Never had to wait more than 2 minutes for a taxi.  During CES.

And I don't mean it in a good way. We had such an unbelievably bad experience that I can't even begin to comprehend how things could have been this ridiculous. It was so terrible that we never even made it to a room and thus this review is based purely on our attempted check-in experience.

We arrived at the Trump around 12:45 a.m. on a Friday night. After sitting in two hours of barely moving traffic en route from San Diego, making our five hour drive a seven hour drive, we were exhausted. All I wanted was to relax in a nice, comfortable bed and regroup for the next day. Instead, we end up sitting in the lobby for not one, not two, but THREE hours! Here's the story:

We check in at 12:45 and the front desk says it will be 15 to 30 minutes until our room is ready. This in itself seems ridiculous. In a hotel with over a thousand rooms, how do they not have a single room ready for check in? Plus, we had booked our room in advance. Check in is around 4 p.m. It should have been ready hours ago! But we decide to take it all in stride and go to the bar for a drink. 

An hour goes by. We go back to talk to the man at front desk. He apologizes and assures us that our room will be ready shortly. He says that we are fourth in line and the cleaner was in our room at the moment. He offers us $25 to use at the bar and an additional $50 on our room key once we receive it. He also says that he would upgrade our room to a suite at no charge.

At this point, it's closing in on 2 a.m. By the time we get to the bar, it was closing (didn't realize bars closed in Vegas) and the bartender offered us free beer for all the hassle. We continue to sit in the lobby, along with several other groups of people, and time continues to tick by. 

Around 3 a.m. we go to the front desk again. The line takes about 30 minutes, as there are already several complaints in front of ours. We finally find out that there was a ""situation"" and our room is still not ready. They can't tell us what the ""situation"" is or explain how a single ""situation"" could cause us to wait for a room for three hours. We finally were offered a room at the Palazzo. The Trump arranged for a car to drive us to the hotel, which is a couple long Vegas blocks away. But before we could leave, we had to reclaim our baggage, which had been loaded on a cart to take to our room. When we asked for our baggage, the girl instead brought our car, which we were going to pick up the next day. 

Eventually, after 4 a.m., we were dropped off at the Palazzo and were able to check in and be in bed by 4:30 a.m.

I have no idea how a hotel can be so incredibly disorganized and deceitful. We didn't appreciate being lied to on several occasions about when our room would be ready and it was absolutely ridiculous how they didn't have a single room ready. 

Needless to say, we won't be returning to the Trump Hotel.",11,1,0

The rooms are spacious and well appointed, with top of the line appliances.  They have a small kitchenette with complete silverware, pots and pans, for you to cook up a simple meal.  For this reason alone, it's a great place for families with kids to stay.  Since there is no casino, you don't have much noise(from clubs) and drunk people walking in the hallways at night, to wake you up from your beauty sleep.  

The bathroom is large and clean.  There's an actual jacuzzi tub with mean jets blasting away your fatigue and lack of sleep from gambling...which bring me to the gaming issue...so if you want to gamble you can go to Wynn or Caesar Palace compliments of the Trump Shuttle which will pick you up and drop you off every 15 minutes...surprisingly convenient.  The last shuttle pick up is at 2am, which is probably a good thing, because you need to either leave with your winning or cut you losses anyways by 2am.  Of course being the procrastinator, I cash in my chips at 1:55 am and run to the pick up location, before my pumpkin shuttle disappears into the night, and right on the dot at 2am the pumpkin shuttle is at the Wynn horse ready to shuttle me back to Trump tower to meet my prince.

Highlights: 
--gym was nice and had enough stuff to keep me fit during the weekend, but didn't have bottled water (instead there was a filter machine with water that still strangely tasted like tap...)
-- saw Lisa Ling here when we checked in (a little celebrity endorsement never hurts)
-- the mini kitchen was great! When we weren't fine dining, we brought back sandwiches for late night snacks and it was nice to be able to store them in the fridge and also be able to boil water for tea.
-- ordered in-suite dining: we had two fresh atlantic salmons with buttered mashed potatoes and broccolini... it was SERIOUSLY TO DIE FOR.... SOOO DELICIOUS. The hotel staff who brought it was also really friendly and chatty while he set up our living table for us with our dinner. They even included a pat of room-temp butter and two brioche buns (which were actually stale, but it's the thought that counts).
-- bathtub was ginormous, and had a jacuzzi in it!! 
-- I also liked that it was kind of off the strip but was a very easy walk over to the Wynn. Also, no casino = no cigarette smoke = easy-breathing for my lungs!


Lowlights:
-- There's a train that honks every single time it brings freight through... I totally understand and support safety... but SERIOUSLY, it's 3am and a girl's trying to get her beauty sleep! Pleeeease, stop blaring your horn!!!
-- Service was spotty... they kept forgetting to restock our water, and we had to ask for housekeeping every afternoon even though our housekeeping button was lit.
-- Where was our upgrade??
-- 4pm checkout was great... until a hotel employee actually keyed into our room at 3pm to ""check if we were still there."" Um... can you say privacy breach?",0,0,0

The hotel was very beautiful and upscale, one of the first hotels that was so beautiful inside as it was out. Some issues included a stain on the blankets of our other friends blankets in their room next to us, and that one point when I was trying out the bath (which is beautiful and has jets) I decided to take a dip and I brought a lush bath bomb with me. So I dropped it in there, the bubbles fizzed perfectly but the they started to rise and so I went to turn the jets off and they wouldn't stop, they actually amplified and then got stuck at the highest setting, so I was scrambling to get the water to drain and to turn the jets off and call the front desk to send someone up to help me. By the time I got to someone over the phone the jets turned off on their own. It was weird but perfect so I wouldn't have to awkwardly tell them what happened and bubbles be filled to the top of the bath. It's a good story to tell everyone but I probably and now scared to turn on the jets anywhere anymore. But the pool was beautiful and warmed perfectly, plus they had amazing seats for tanning and to just lay there. Just amazing. They were also able to extend our check out to time because we wanted to enjoy the pool because we didn't get a chance to while we were there.

So loud that even ear plugs don't work.  Does not bode well for getting a good night sleep.  They don't tell you about this.  Also, if you want to get to the strip, your walking options are to go thru the mall (not very direct) or walk on the street (no sidewalks on one side and partial side walks on the other).

One more thing they don't tell you about is a 19.95 PER NIGHT resort fee which gives you access to a shuttle that takes you to and from the strip since it is not walking accessible as I just described.

I read the reviews here before we went, and maybe that got my expectations too high?  We went for our friends' wedding.  They had a 3-bedroom suite & held the ceremony there.  That suite was beautiful with a spectacular view of the strip.  We, however, reserved a studio suite on the strip side (to avoid the noisy trains as indicated by other yelpers).  We arrived at 4:30.  First they asked me if I wanted to pay $50\/night to upgrade to a 1-bedroom.  No thanks I said.  then They informed me that they didn't have any studio's available for me.  So they were going to put me in a 1-bedroom for free (great!); but it was on the mountain-view side of the hotel (boo!).  But she PROMISED me this was still the ""quiet"" part of the hotel.  So we took it.  It was on the 16th floor, but since I don't spend a lot of time staring out the window, who cares?  We walk in & the suite is beautiful (on the surface).  High end stainless steel appliances (that I'd never use on a weekend in Vegas).  But, as we used the room to get ready, wake up, etc., the blemishes began to show.  They didn't empty the trash (from the previous guest) in the kitchen.  Didn't restock the robes.  No cotton balls or Q-tips. Long black hair in the tub, on the floor and in the sink of the master bath.  The door to the toilet in the master bath was just a shower door that banged shut so loudly, I had to use the other bathroom in the night so as not to wake my husband.  We tried to log into the ""free"" wi-fi (part of the $25\/night resort fee) so we could facetime our kids before they went to bed, but the wi-fi signal was so poor the whole time, we couldn't use it (this was true for our other friends staying in the hotel too). So, we went out for the evening and came back.  Then Housekeeping brought us robes (which were the most comfortable hotel robes I've ever used!).  Went to bed and heard the dang trains.  So much for the quiet side! In the morning, we made our ""free in-room coffee"", and it was your typical crappy packaged coffee out of a crappy coffee maker.  Why put those high end appliances in, which most people won't use, and then provide a crappy coffee maker which most people will use? Now, if we were in a regular Vegas hotel, we could just go downstairs and find a coffee shop and grab a good cup of coffee and some pastry and get past it.  But Trump doesn't offer that.  It's either really expensive room service ($9.00 for a small pot of coffee plus $3 delivery fee, plus 18% gratuity), or get showered & dressed & head down to the restaurant or 3-block walk to the strip.  I'm a coffee addict - gotta have it to get going, so to not have easy access to drinkable coffee is pretty rough on me.  The bathrooms were also lacking places to hang robes and hand towels. No hooks or racks other than on the shower door.  Not a big deal to just put my towel on the counter, but it's just another detail that Trump has lost in exchange for the ""pow"" of the first impression.  My husband did speak to them about our disappointments, and they readily gave us a $75 credit on our bill which was good.  But for about the same price or just a little bit more, we've stayed at the Venetian, the Palazzo, and Mandalay Bay with similar rooms and much, MUCH better amenities.  This is not the hotel for us.

It's a non-smoking hotel and casino free so there's this moment of relief when you walk in the doors.  No need to snake your way through a crowded, smokey casino floor to get to your room.  Because it's brand new, it's absolutely gorgeous, clean and the staff are super friendly.  There's an extra layer of privacy for rooms because you have to enter a hallway door to gain access to your actual room door (the entry-way is shared with another room) so it feels like an apartment.  Each room comes equipped with a small kitchenette so there's a fridge for alcohol, a microwave for those 2a.m. burritos and a Wolf range in case you're really ambitious and want to make ramen.  

The pool is small but it works for people that are looking to have a relaxing, enjoyable time in the water. It doesn't jive with folks that go to the pool wearing heels, all skanked out, and looking for a wet t-shirt contest to win. It's no Tao beach.  Just the way I like it.

She was very condescending and short with her comments. Fortunately, my stay there was nothing but spectacular from then on. This hotel has by far exceeded any other hotel I've stayed in when it comes to customer service. The concierge compiled a list of clubs for my girlfriends & I to enjoy for the night and suggested a few shows that were must sees on the strip. I wanted to eat at Olives restaurant, but when I arrived there I was told that it was reservation only. I called the concierge and let her know the situation. She not only remembered who I was from hours prior, but she placed me on hold, called Olives and was able to book me a reservation within 15 minutes. The valet\/bell service was amazing as well. Completely professional and prompt when it came to picking up my bags and getting my car. They even held my bags after I had checked out so I could enjoy the spa. One of them had even noticed that 2 of my friends were following me to my room, so they called and asked if I wanted robes & slippers delivered so that my guests could be more comfortable. During my stay, I also had a spa treatment. I couldn't resist considering I only paid $100 for the room and was given a $50 spa credit. The spa staff was very attentive, and made sure I was completely calm, relaxed & void of any stressors. When I checked out, the bell staff did one more amazing thing....they personally drove me in a complimentary SUV to the airport. Their reasoning was because I can't come out of the spa relaxed, to sit in a cramped, smelly cab to the airport.

The rooms were averaged size suites, with a kitchen, large bathroom (complete with an embedded TV in the mirror) and pull out bed sofa. The pool is small and private which is nice in comparison to the Palazzo where you have to fight for a spot on the weekends.

I scored a two room suite with two bathrooms, two showers, and a refrigerator.

Talked with the bartender, Katherine for a bit until I was joined by Karen just a few seats away. Had great conversation about the US and Australia - her home downunder...

She and I had drinks together until she said that she was hoping I would escort her to Wynn for some gaming. Got a cab and off we went!

The conference was at the Wynn, but since they had increased their prices to $500+ a night for the conference, we went Trump.  The room was $119\/night on Orbitz.  When we arrived, the front desk offered an upgrade to a 1 bedroom suite with a view of the Strip for $50 more a night.  We took the upgrade.  

Honestly, I was expecting to walk into a gold plated tacky room, but it was very classy and pretty.  The whole hotel was quiet and laid back.  The room was big (I'd guess around 800-900 sf?) with a full kitchen, dining area, living room, bedroom, and 2 full bathrooms.  The bathroom had one of the new tv's that is built into the mirror....very cool!  The shower was huge with double showerheads.  It turned out nice to have the separate living area because my boyfriend ended up staying out late every night and I went to sleep and got up earlier.  I had a place to relax and watch tv while he slept in.  

The staff was very friendly.  The hotel had a free shuttle that left about every 5 minutes for the Wynn so that saved us a bunch in taxi fees.  The lobby had gorgeous light fixtures and a chill bar\/seating area.  We never waited more than 1 minute for an elevator.  

The best thing, though, was that our flight was leaving at 5:45 and we really had nothing to do between checkout at 11am and our flight.  We asked for a late checkout expecting to get noon or MAYBE one o'clock.  To my surprise, they gave us a 4pm checkout without any extra fees!  Really great service!  

This was an awesome value and definitely one of the best places to stay in the city, especially if you are looking for a place that is a little more relaxed (besides, it's still a 2 minute cab ride to all the craziness!).  We will definitely stay here again!  Thanks Trump!",3,0,2

The King sized bed for my Husband and I were plush and comfortable. The pull out bed for the boys was a disappointment. Because of this, I will never accept a sofa pull out for anyone I travel with---ever. Trump name is synonymous with class, classy, and more class. The pull out was totally, unbecoming and should not be used to sleep kids or anyone---period.

Guestrooms were NOT impressive enough, after walking through the amazing lobby and  front desk area. Very dissapointed. For looking like a gold brick from the outside, the guestrooms are dull and lifeless.

After staying at Wynn and Encore, Trump tower seems like a slight downgrade. I mean its probably fine if im a 65 yr old woman. 

Service here is seriously BELOW average. The Valet failed at washing my car, when they PROMISED to do so. They expected me to roll around Las Vegas Blvd in my dusty vehicle, dirty from my 9 hour drive!! super pissed!! At least they offered me a free towncar to and from The Strip. And later that night, they finally detailed our suv.

Also......One of the girls at the poolside cafe, accidently, charged my boyfriend $200 for suntan lotion instead of $20. So glad he noticed and had the manager refund the 180$ (which took over 25 minutes of valuable tanning time.)

Some good things i liked about Trump was the food at the Poolside cafe. yummy. The gym was very nice too! I had a great workout.

I'm not sure that I can say anything that hasn't already been said.

THE FLOOR. I was cold, just gotten my phone stolen, and wanted some comfort and found more comfort ON THE FLOOR than on the couch bed.

We ordered room service--it's nice but it did take quite a bit and the food was middling. Goat cheese pizza though, that was bomb. Chips and salsa, hot wings--Applebee's quality with Donald's prices.

The pool plays loud music throughout the whole day and it is impossible to relax or nap. The pool also opens at 7am, and was filled with screaming kids so sleeping in was not an option either. There is also a freight train that runs throughout the night, with a very loud whistle that wakes you up every 2-3 hours. It was an absolutely horrible experience that I paid $290+\/night for.

Not that there's anything particularly wrong with this Trump hotel, it just doesn't feel like it should be in Las Vegas.

The location is a couple of blocks off the Strip which can be a good or a bad thing, depending on what you want from your stay in Vegas. Its easy to drive elsewhere if you have a car, and a cab ride will cost $15-20 to the farthest reaches of the strip like the Mandalay Bay, and much less for hotels that are closer. 

For those with a car this hotel has valet only, although it is free (included in the resort fee). The valet staff was hard-working and was always friendly and professional on both drop-off and pickup.

This is also a non-smoking resort, although there were a few people smoking in the pool area (wtf). 

The pool was OK but nothing to write home about. Lounge chairs were plentiful and comfortable, but the pool only went 4ft. deep, kinda lame for someone well over 6ft. tall. There were also two hot tubs, one on either side of the pool, but they close at 6pm (another wtf). The final wtf is for them playing loud, annoying, radio music over speakers that are placed so far apart that it sounds like you are listening to the same song twice, only one of them is playing a half second after the other. For me pools are for relaxing, not for partying, but I could see others differing form my opinion.

There is only one restaurant in this hotel and I didn't have a chance to try it. The menu looked like standard American hotel cuisine (boring) so I ventured out to other hotels and also away from the Strip to satisfy my culinary urges. 

The lounge next to the restaurant is only open until Midnight on Sundays. Not sure about other days.

Finally, the rooms were very good but with a few downsides. I stayed in the basic room (forget the actual name of the suite but it was the lowest priced room). It was indeed huge and well appointed with a well-sized water closet (walk-in shower), separated toilet closet, dual-vanity sink, and large jacuzzi tub. Everything in the bathroom was great except the shower head had some crust on it and could have used a second shower head, or just a better shower head that had a bigger coverage area (again, I'm a large human and so I prefer a shower that covers more than a few square inches of my body at a time).

The bed was comfortable but not super comfortable (could have been softer). It creaked a bit as I imagine thousands of people have already had sex in it, with thousands more to do so in the future (hey, its Las Vegas). There were also a few chips on the wood bed frame and the mattress was a few inches too short for the frame. The pillows were super soft and collapsed just how I like. The sheets were also very soft.

The AC worked fine but there was a large paint chip on the exhaust grill. 

The view of the strip was great, but be warned, you can still hear car traffic and police\/ ambulance sirens form the street, even way up on the 59th floor. The windows were double pained but were not at all completely sound-proof like they should have or could have been. Its obvious that they cut corners when designing and\/ or building this tower,

Additionally, some airplanes taking off from the McCarren turn and fly directly overhead Trump which may or may not bother you.

Room entrances are side by side sharing a common entrance, so its like having two doors to your room. This is a nice touch and means you can't hear any noise from the elevator or hallways. However, the doors are very heavy and SLAM shut super loud, which can be annoying. 

Wi-fi is included in the resort fee. There are no safes in the room. The mini kitchen is nice too with a mini fridge that is empty and not stocked with overpriced hotel crap.

My final analyses is that this hotel is more suited to a regular city like New York or Chicago and that I would prefer to stay somewhere else next time I am in Las Vegas. The hotel is nice but is in no way perfect and lacks the dining variety of a Belaggio, Mandalay Bay, Venetian, etc. 

Oh ya, and there is no casino at this hotel.",2,2,1

They purport to be a child friendly place with a high level of customer service, yet my experience was to the contrary. I lost an item (my jacket) and they gave me the run around for almost two hours, claiming that this person would help me, and then that person, with no one actually assisting me. Meanwhile my three children and their grandmas sat in the cold in our cars (we were ready to leave to return home, trying to beat the traffic). They ultimately claimed no one in the hotel had access to lost and found during this two hour window.  I received three different stories about how the lost and found system operates.  I kept asking why we couldn't have someone just escort me to the lost and found area so I could quickly identify my jacket, and I got no answer other than it was against policy.  I also kept asking why someone couldn't just run up there and bring it back to me.  This apparently was also against some policy.  It was only after I became vocal about my frustration that someone from the housekeeping department finally said she would go look, but she said it would take 30 minutes to locate it... ??

One gentleman from security was extremely rude, actually criticizing me for not making a report to lost and found sooner. (I came to the hotel with a husband, three small kids, two grandmas, and my brother in law, so it was a busy trip. I only realized it was missing the same morning I reported it.) When I told him that he and the hotel were being disrespectful of our family situation by not finding a way to retrieve my jacket, he actually rolled his eyes. 

I asked to speak to manager about the situation, and was told she would not speak to me, because she was in a meeting. She then ultimately came out to the front desk and didn't say a word to me. 

It was truly an unbelievable experience, and sullied our five-day stay here. 

People come to hotels like this for the customer service and hospitality, and this place fell short. There are other smoke free hotels with a much higher level of service available. It is too bad because it is an aesthetically pleasing property with some great aspects. There is this great heated pool, and the housekeepers on our floor were a delight.

I decided that I wanted to savor life, and enjoy each and every waking moment, which meant one thing of course: to visit a little oasis in the midst of the desert that is aptly named ""Sin City."" Last year, I decided to pay a visit to this gem of a town not once, not twice, but a whopping THREE times.

My friend from California decided to visit me in Arizona, and since he exudes innocence, I decided that I should corrupt him with epileptic lights, and casinos that reek of cigarettes and regret. However, I decided to mix in a little spontaneity and instead of booking directly on a casino website, I decided to gamble on Hotwire and see what hotel I would get as a result. After careful sleuthing, especially with the disclaimer that it indeed was NOT a casino, I knew we were going to be spending one luxurious night at the Trump. I was ecstatic, and so was my friend. After gently prodding my roommate to accompany us, we were ready to proceed with our whirlwind trip.

Five hours later, we arrived. We had a bellhop generously help us with our luggage, and had our doors held for us as we entered. Strangely enough, I felt like Kevin Mcallister when he entered the Plaza Hotel. After being offered an upgrade for an additional fifty dollar charge, we kindly rejected the offer and went up to our room. And my, what a room it was! It was like our own mini studio apartment. The bathroom was to die for. There was a shower for some sexy time, a bath tub with jets, and a mandatory toilet for....well, you know. After playing some sleazy drinking games, we decided to head towards the strip. The whole night was a blur. I vaguely remember my friend saying that he was sleepy so he decided to end the night early, and I decided to drink celebratory shots for no apparent reason with my roommate. At two in the morning, we briefly ate and then spent our night soaking our hurting feet in the tub.

The next morning is when all the trouble began. I was extremely hungover, and my friends were hungry so we utilized the free shuttle to Caesar's palace, and ate. My stomach was churning, my head was throbbing, so I didn't savor my food so I left my friends there and took the shuttle back. Thankfully, I didn't have to wait long. The next couple of hours were sheer agony for me. I was indebted with gratitude that they let me do a late check-out, and by the time I actually could function, it was  four thirty in the afternoon. They did not try to charge us, or reject my plea for late checkout.

All in all, I loooooved this hotel. I will stay again. You do get what you pay for. Fortunately, I didn't have to cleanse my life savings out of my wallet out for a night's stay due to Hotwire! I will stay again. However, my liver has thoroughly suffered my Vegas craze of 2011, so I will not be paying another visit for quite some time. Hopefully the world doesn't end by then.

The noise from the train tracks\/noise didn't bother me but might be an issue for light sleepers. The hotel staff were excellent. We were able to get an early check in at past 10 in the morning. We needed something for the bathroom and it was delivered within 10 minutes. The front desk even called us to make sure we received it and if we needed anything else.

The staff mentally checks out around this time of year. The service at the bar, the lounge, restaurants, and even House keeping is horrible!  Every year the company I work for treats us to a Vegas weekend, and next year if we do stay at the Trump again, I will pass.

I think I saw like 2 kids the entire weekend.  The service was great and my girls and I got to ride the in-house Escalade to the Wynn b\/c we were too lazy to walk.  Oh, and room service...the Trump burger is excellent.  A bit pricey but worth a try.  There is no self-parking, but valet parking isn't too bad just $14\/day.  I've stayed at other hotels where valet is $29\/day.  Like I said, this hotel isn't for the stingy but if you must, parking is free directly across the street at the Fashion Mall.  Some of my girls didn't have any clubbing gear but since the mall was directly across the street it was quick and convenient to spruce up their wardrobe without traveling across the strip.  The pool is small but I love the little cabanas outside you can bask in.  The rooms and bathrooms are a decent size, but the comfort deserves an A.  The bed was very comfortable.  Now the jacuzzi tub is the star of the weekend...after clubbing for 5 hours straight I appreciated my stay here.  Getting to relax in a bubbly bath with jets blasting at my tingly toes won me over completely.  And the best part is that I pricelined this hotel for $150\/night.  Thanks Trump!",2,1,1

It ended at 12am though, which made it hard to catch the shuttle after a late show. 
  
Some people complained about rude valet and front desk staff, but I found everyone to be really friendly and helpful. The only downside was the train. I was on the 28th floor and the train was still super loud. But who comes to Vegas to sleep right?!

Wynn is right across from it, less than a mile, walk so it's not so bad if you want to gamble.  Can't believe people knock it just for that...come on people don't be lazy!!! 

Rooms.
-Rooms are all Suites, with kitchenette fully stocked, stove, dishes, fridge, Flat Screen TVs, good TV channels, nice little iPod stereo, and kept up well.  
-Comfortable Bed and couches to sit in.
-There is even a TV in the bathroom mirror. Yes..flush against the mirror right in the middle. 
-Bathroom has double sinks and is bright so when getting ready you can actually see yourself. 
-Have a vanity mirror. Important for getting ready. 
-This is a perfect hotel for the regulars and business peeps that have a system down for their Vegas experience.

Other Top Reasons why.

1) Customer service is exceptional
2) Best smelling hotel ever. So fresh...so clean. 
3) As with all hotels in Vegas, valet is free, but since it is not crazy big..wait isn't as long for the car.
4) Location is right across from Fashion Show Mall...so during the day it's a quick walk over. 
5) If you drive like most LA peeps and use your car to get around during the day, skip the hassle with parking valet for quick returns to the room and park in the carport across at the mall, run across to your room, do what you have to do, then walk back and quickly get into your car. Kind of convenient for the impatient people like myself.
6) Starbucks, Teavana, and last minute deal tickets booth right across at Fashion Show Mall.
7) Close to all the hottest clubs in Vegas. 4PM CHECKOUT!

The lobby is beautiful, the rooms were nice & spacious and it was right across the street from Fashion Show Mall. We could walk to the Wynn and Treasure Island, no problem and the hotel offered a shuttle to Ceasar's. 

Now, time for the not so nice: 
They have a small restaurant and bar in the lobby, but  lacking a small coffee shop. A girl needs her latte in the mornings! I stayed at the Vdara which is similar in concept and they had a little snack\/coffee shop in the lobby which was the perfect place to grab a coffee or quick bite. 

We had an odd relationship with housekeeping & room service. We called down for cups numerous times. We NEVER got them, however someone brought up two robes up to us TWICE and we never asked for them. I don't know how you confuse cups with robes??? 

Secondly, we asked housekeeping to clean our room before we left for the night. They came and made up the bed, left the sofa bed unmade and the bathroom uncleaned. We were very confused. Then, they left us a voicemail saying they were sorry they couldn't clean our room. My friends and I were slightly confused....... I am still confused.

I couldn't believe that a hotel that I chose for my special day and that I spent almost 1,000 dollars on completely shunned me after I left. 

To mention a few: 
-We were walked in on several times.
-They messed up our room service order several times
-One room service breakfast we had came with a broken coffee pot that spilled all over me and burned the crap out of me
-Urine in the toilet when we checked in

We stayed at Trump because it was rated a 5 star hotel.
We were not happy nor would we stay or recommend anyone to stay there. 
My wife and I enjoy the amenities a property has to offer, Trump was very limiting. We usually enjoy a hot tub in the evening and the pool closed at 5pm. We work out in the early morning and go to the hot tub after our workout, the hot tubs didn't open until 9am, poor service for guests. Their fitness center was no where near what a 5 star hotel should offer. Very poor and not enough equipment along with being too small. They have a shuttle service that takes you to two different locations. However, they are not very timely or organized in what they are doing. They say the shuttle comes by every 15-20 minutes, however we were late to our dinner reservations due to the shuttle being over 30 minutes late in returning. 
Our room was nice however, it was not very clean. The first shower we took the water didn't drain well. When I rubbed my foot over the drain, a big clump of hair was moved... GROSS, not mine! The floor we were on must have had an earlier water leak problem. The carpet was raised and wrinkling, it had an odor of a water problem and like the carpet was still wet. 
The only good thing about the hotel was the staff, they were very friendly if you asked them anything and helpful at check in and check out, and confirming our plane flight.

We had a jacuzzi tub with marble floors, double sinks, complimentary water, and a fridge. We had just stayed at the Bellagio where if you even open the fridge they charge you $20 with their stupid infra-red sensors, so it was welcoming to be able to use the fridge. The mini-kitchen was stocked with dishes and ... wine glasses.

So we opened up a bottle of wine and drank wine in the jacuzzi. It was super-relaxing and felt decadent.  I felt like I was in a music video or maybe a cheesy porn.

We checked out the pool, and I think Trump ran out of money when it came to the pool. The lounge area was great, but the pool looked like a kiddie pool -- I was expecting gold trimming around the pool or some fountains, but it was nothing special.

It's kind of weird to walk in and not hear a casino or shops -- this felt like a hotel and a place where you can get away from it all, which is very rare in Vegas.

When it comes to Five star and luxury The Venetian, Palazzo, Four Season and Caesars Palace are my favorites. I'm pretty big with staying at my regulars but this time I decided to venture off and book Trump Towers for the first time. 

From the moment I drove up valet was already there waiting for me to hand my keys over. Before I could open the lobby doors the bellman was all ready holding the door open. When I had arrived at 11:00am and with check in at 3:00pm, guest services without any issues allowed me to check in. I had not even been at the hotel for more than a few minutes and already receiving exceptionally great service.

Located on the 60th floor, I checked into the two bedroom penthouse suite which overlooked the Vegas strip. The penthouse included a living room, fully equipped kitchen, dining table and two and a half bathrooms. The bathrooms included a built in TV in the mirrors. The master bedroom included a king size bed, two sofas seats and walk in closets. The second bedroom a bit smaller but just as nice.

The smoke free penthouse was very spacious and located on the highest floor of the towers. In my opinion, for a five star hotel I was expecting more. It's comparable to a regular hotel room but with much more space. I was not disappointed just surprised it lacked the luxury.

When it came to customer service, Trump Towers definitely exceeded my expectations. When an issue arose, the housekeeping manager arrived to my room within minutes. Once the issue was resolved, the doorbell rang again and a teddy bear was dropped off with an apology. What hotel does this? It was a genuine and thoughtful gesture! It really showed how much they cared about their hotel guest.

We did take note of the comments made to stay away from the Train Tracks in order to avoid disturbance from the sound of passing trains. We were placed on the 58th floor which had clear view of the tracks yet it wasn't noisy up there but based on another party staying in the room they indicated wanting to switch. We were moved down to the 22nd floor which was more noisy. The Television in both rooms were defective which is apparently a standard issue of theirs everyone complains about. Funny how the T.V. inside the Bathroom Mirror works just fine! 

We were staying at an 'Owners Room' which means the room is sold like a condo and is then rented out on days the owners are not there. These rooms have two doors, one at the foyer and the 2nd door leading to the room itself. Our keys worked just fine letting us in through the foyer but the card reader for the 2nd door was dead. No flashing green or red light. We returned to our room at 4 AM and had an issue getting in. We were given new cards which failed to read, had security meet us at the room whose card also was't working, and had Engineering sent to work his magic in opening that damn door! Took them 30 minutes to finally get it open the first night. Engineering stated the battery which reads cards was dead yet they did not switch it out the first night. Went down to complain about the incident to the Manager who claimed to send someone up to check it out. The door was never fixed and we approached the same issue the following night at which point we requested Engineering to switch out the battery right then and there to avoid the same problem the 3rd night. 

We also had issues with the toilet shooting water out the bowl! Could you imagine that?! It splashed out the bowl and went shooting at my legs!!!!! How disgusting is that?! LOL!!! I came out to tell this story to my 'roommates' who stated experiencing the same issue. Instead of the water swirling in the bowl and flushing down it would basically look like the water was burping\/bubbling instead at which point would shoot out. They've clearly got plumbing problems which were not fixed.

Positives had to be the comfortable beds, down comforters and feather down pillows which were extremely cozy. Also enjoyed the large bathroom and huge stand up shower. Did not get to take advantage of the massive deep tub which was big enough to fit 3 since I'm afraid of sitting in someone else's germs, but it looked lovely. 

Our housekeeper during our stay was extremely friendly and took care of us, in return we took care of her by tipping her well for her services. I would recommend doing so for better care and perks. Just place a note on top of the $$$ indicating tip is for Housekeeping otherwise they will not touch it. Service was 5 star worthy, hotel itself and their broken amenities were not.

Tracy, the manager, took care of two nights stay due to the issues we encountered which were appreciated. Just fix your toilet and TV in room 2200 and make sure the battery on that door is working properly to avoid future problems!",7,8,6

I'm over the casino scene so that wasn't a big deal to me. 

It's what I imagine living in a New York high rise apartment would be like.

I stayed here for the 1\/2 marathon and my cousin was also staying here for a UFC event. I saw her room and pretty much it's what a studio apartment in New York might look like. Huge bed, huge closets, couch are, fridge and stove, jacuzzi tub, sexy shower, and absolutely gorgeous views. My room was similar to a one bed room apartment. I got upgraded to a suite and my jaw literally dropped when I walked in. Full kitchen, dining area, living room with L-shaped couch, one bathroom out front with shower and another bathroom inside the master bedroom which looked like Mariah Carrey's bathroom. The robes were to-die-for and the jacuzzi tub was heaven and the jets came in handy after the marathon. 

There are two shuttles that take you either to Caesar's Palace or the Wynn. The shuttles were nice and clean and the drivers were always courteous. The staff from the door men, to the front desk, to housekeeping were all very professional and courteous. 

This is definitely my new hotel of choice!",2,0,4

We got looks from ""oh so cute"" to ""what the..."" Hey, can't leave home without them.  But back to the TIH.  We were most impressed.  I love the fact that there is NO Casino upon entering the premises like at the TI or Wynn.  And the fact that it's a bit off the Strip was not a deal breaker. Really, it's a five minute walk if you quicken your steps. And, of course, we enjoyed having the kichenette in our studio and the TV in the bathroom mirror...wow!

The service was impeccable.  We felt like VIPs and this all happened by the luck of the draw on Hotwire.  We had no idea where we were staying until after we made payment.  When I realized it was Trump, I frowned.  I have my issues with the Donald but I like his stamp on the hotel.

The thing I didn't like the most was all the fees! There's a $3.00 fee on the $25 resort fee. There's a fee on the fee.  There's also a room tax of $24. Oh please! Then there were other things like when we called for salt and pepper to add taste to our homemade breakfast, they charged $3.90 for delivery. Guess what? They are sitting pretty on my kitchen counter now. And the Wi-Fi did not work the whole time we were there.  Yet part of the resort fee covers it.  So, we paid for nothing.  If you have T-Mobile, you can only make emergency phone calls on your phone.  But they work great when you're outside.  Talk about 'can you hear me now?'

For those of you who travel with your pets.  They charge $200 not refundable fee and provide a water bowl and complimentary snack.  My snobby Chi's did not like the snack.  Because they spent most of the time in the room, we could not get housekeeping. And we were fine with that.",3,3,2

What about constant honking from the congested valet parking area? Or, have always wanted to turn on a TV and enjoy the crackle of completely blown speakers?  What about...taking a mildly warm shower with only one of the shower heads pumping out warm water and the other producing cold? Then the Trump is the place for you! 

We've stayed at numerous hotels in Las Vegas. We do not spend a ton of time in the room... it's Vegas of course and you are there to have fun.  But, with that being said, your room should be a place you can retreat too when it's time to rest from all the fun. 

We tried the Trump and after reading some reviews about the train I was a little concerned. In the end we booked with them and took a chance.  I let the front desk know during checking it was our first time at the hotel and I was a little concerned about the train. The staff were very professional and courteous. The guy who checked us in mentioned we shouldn't hear anything as the building was designed very well and if so, let them know and they would accommodate us.  We were up on the 34th floor.  

Upon entering the room, it was clean but a little worn looking. I turned on the TV to rest from the days travel and the speakers were blown as mentioned. TV #2 in the bedroom worked and I just pressed on ... we were not going to watch a lot of TV while there but... the set needed to be fixed at some point.. if not for us.. some other guests. 

Even up on the 34th floor you could hear a lot of honking going on below.  The way the hotel is setup.. the valet area is very small and it gets congested quick. The staff work hard to keep it moving but they get overwhelmed. So, this causes frustrations for people trying to leave, trying to merge on the the street and for the traffic on the street. Poor setup and flow. 

The hotel offers a shuttle service to the Bellagio and Caesar's.  it's a cattle call and the typical wait time is about 30 min.  It's just easier to catch a cab and move on. Again.. the staff\/valet were nice\/professional.  

After a fun night out on the town... as I mentioned... the showers were luke warm at best and cold most of the time. Maybe we just got a room with issues? But, it just wasn't what we expected. 

I knew after being able to hear the cars below.... if the train did blast its horn... we would hear it... again... even up on the 34th floor.   Well... 2am rolls around... HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORN BLAAAAAAAAAST!   I just had to laugh.  This hotel is lauded for being so great when it was just average at best. The train sounded off again at 4 and 5.  I can't even imagine what the people on the first few floors must have heard. 

All in all... the Trump did not live up to what I have read in the glowing reviews on Yelp.  The place looked  worn, had noise problems and several other issues.  

We will not be going back and we will not recommend others to stay there.

Last year I had a wonderful experience at Las Vegas Trump hotel celebrating my girlfriends birthday. So I decided to try it again at the same hotel, and sure enough I was glad I did. I booked for a 2 night stay Friday through Sunday on Easter weekend. I wanted to make it would truly be a special weekend for my girlfriend by getting a suite with a beautiful view of the Las Vegas strip. Sure enough I contacted Trump Int Hotel LV through email and Maribel Rodriguez helped me out. I told her about me and my girlfriend celebrating her birthday weekend and she replied back with an upgraded room with a beautiful view high in the hotel and birthday amenities at no charge. And boy did they deliver! Once we checked in, the girl at the front desk said happy birthday to my girlfriend. We went to our room to see the marvelous view of our suite. In the closest they had 2 soft bathrobes for me and my girlfriend. When my girlfriend went to the bathroom to put her hair straightener away in one of the bathroom cabinets, she found a cute little box of delicious belgian truffle chocolates, yum! Both her and I were very astonished by this sweet gesture. Day 2 came and the Bell Captain named Brady Stanford approached me and told me how my day was going. I told him that it was going wonderful and I am glad to be celebrating my girlfriends birthday. Sure enough he says, ""Oh its your girlfriends birthday, let me see what I can do for you."". He asked me what my girlfriends name was and what room I was staying in, and so I told him. Sure enough around 3 AM after coming back from a Las Vegas night club, someone left a message on my door that said to contact room service for an amenity. I call and sure enough a man named Martin comes and delivers 6 big chocolate dipped strawberries to our suite along with a birthday card with my girlfriends name on it. Me and my girlfriend were definitely very delighted for the kind act Mr.Stanford did for my girlfriend. The chocolate dipped strawberries tasted so delicious with our Stella Rosa wine! So I want to give out a big thank you for making my girlfriends birthday experience even more special. Thank you Maribel Rodriguez , Brady Stanford, Martin and all staff members that took part of making our experience at the Trump hotel a very beautiful 2 night stay. Aside from that, they also gave us a late 1pm checkout which was a plus after partying hard on Saturday night and two wine glasses to drink our Stella Rosa that we brought from home. I will definitely come back and continue to book again at Trump International hotel when I visit Las Vegas. Twice they have made my experience special with my girlfriend and I can guarantee they will continue to do so. 

Notes: Trump hotel offers shuttle service at no charge and drops you off at either Wynn hotel and casino or Caesars Palace. The shuttle is right outside in front of the hotel. It is a big black van that fits around 10 people. They also pick you up from the same place they dropped you off (Wynn or Caesars), as a shuttle passes every 15 minutes to drop off people from Trump and take people back to Trump. The shuttle stops at 12AM at Caesars and at 2AM at Wynn if Im not mistaken. Don't let the distance from the strip discourage you, the shuttle drops you where all the action is at (Caesars). 

Notes: They offer shoe shining service at no charge, and boy did they made my Stacy Adams shine super nice and black before I went to the club!

Notes: All rooms come with a big fridge, microwave, and a stove. This is a plus since we brought water bottles, beer and liquor with us. We kept all of our drinks cold!",0,0,0

My bachlorette party was legit!!  I knew I was going to Vegas with a handful of my favorite girls, but other than that I had no clue where we were staying or the days events.

When we landed, I thought I heard a gf tell the taxi cab to go to Tropicana.  When we pulled up to the Trump Tower I was blown away!!

The Good:
*  The hotel does not have a casino so you don't have to inhale second hand smoke.
* No casino means no crazy vibe.  It's the first time I've been to Vegas and was able to unwind and relax!
*  The lobby was very chic with chandeliers and a clean scent.
*  Staff was very accommodating with any\/all our needs for the weekend.

Better:
*  We received VIP service and was able to use the Trump vehicle to get to our destination.
*  The hotel is located across from the mall which houses some of my favorite shops:  Nordstrom, Zara, Topshop, etc.
* Cab rides were inexpensive.  Maybe about $10 to get to the strip.

The BEST:
*  We were on the 46th floor.  So high that my ears popped when getting to the room.  Which also means that we were so high that we didn't hear the train that other people are complaining about.
* The two bedroom suite was AMAZING!!!!  So huge that we had a foyer!!! Each bedroom came equipped with a kitchenette with sleek stainless steel appliances.  AND we had 3 bathrooms for 9 girls.  No problems getting ready at all!!!
*  The pool was very chic and had cabanas available.

I would definitely stay here again.  It was such a great experience.

My only qualm is the fact that one of the rooms smelled like someone lit and smoked a cigarette in it.  We called the front desk and they were able to get staff to spray down the room and to eliminate our resort fees for putting up with it.  Great customer service!",6,5,6

I was hesitant but booked anyway because the rooms looked nice. When we arrived at the hotel we mentioned it was our first time there and asked if they can help make our stay more memorable and the guy who checked us in upgraded us to a killer suite without hesitation. We got unpacked and headed down to the lobby bar and in the elevator, a man asked how our stay was so far and we answered so far so good. He turned out to be the GM and after our first round of drinks were brought to us we were told he had taken care of them for us. It was a great way to begin our mini vacay!

The bathroom is very spacious as well with separate tub, shower and toilet. The corner suite is very big and has full kitchen equipped with full size fridge with freezer, dishwasher, oven, stove and microwave. Big jacuzzi tub in 1 of the bathrooms. This room held 11 people at 1 point when we all decided to cook lunch and ate there. The pool is very nice and the view from the pool is amazing. The shuttle service to Wynn and Cesar's Palace is very convenient as it is very hot to walk outside. All staff are very friendly and helpful. Oh and you get complimentary water, tea, and coffee that you can make on the Keurig they have in the room so you don't have to purchase one at all! Security also check for your room key when you are coming in late night which made me feel very safe and secure. It's a non-smoking place as there isn't any casino so my nose didn't really get stuffy and my boys didn't get amy nose bleed unlike when we stayed in hotel\/casino.

Things got off to a bad start when I walked into the lobby and saw two drunken guests bring led out by a security guard. But that does not affect my review. Besides a dirty bedspread that might not have have been changed in months, the room was beautiful and very comfortable. The built in TV in the bathroom did not work.

The car valet service was very efficient but keep one thing in mind -- almost all of the cars are parked out in the open in a totally unguarded lot close to the hotel. The hotel assumes no responsibility for car break ins or damage. My presumption that cars were parked in a secure area was strained as I watched my car bring driven out the hotel driveway and down the street. 

Yes the trains are a pain. A hotel employee told me the train noise is THE reason why the building failed as condos. He said most of the condo owners can't stand the train noise and just rent their units out or allow the hotel to use them, for compensation, for guests. I honestly think the reason passing trains sound their loud horn while passing is to say FU Trump (just a theory but it is odd that the horns blow in the same spot every time a train passes).",2,2,0

I LOVED staying here for 3 nights in Vegas this past weekend.  I'm going to list all of the hotel's awesome qualities just like some other ppl below are doing.

-The staff was amazing!  Soooo nice!  From the man who opens car doors, to the girl at the check-in counter and the man who brought our room service order at 2am, every single person was likeable and extra friendly.

-The room was fantastic!  It was just my friend and I staying, so for just 2 people the room was enormous, but it made the experience so fun and relaxing.  There is a full kitchen in each room which I wasn't expecting, but it's not one of those lame kitchens that they have in those extended stay dumps, this was a beautiful little kitchenette that wasn't even noticeable.  There was a large tub with strong jets, plus a separate shower and toilet room.  The living room area of our room was great!  2 big chairs, and a very cozy couch.  I was just extremely impressed with the room.

-There are 2 free shuttles, one for the Wynn (essential if you're planning on partying at Tryst, XS or Surrender or Encore Beach), and one that drops you off at Caesar's palace (perfect spot for anything else on the strip).  We used both shuttles and barely had to wait at all to pick them up.

-4pm check out man.... they spoil us!!  Warning though, they will soon be discontinuing the 4pm late check out because there is not enough time for the staff to clean the rooms for incoming customers.... sorry....but they still have it going on for a little longer so you can always ask.

The above things were what made our hotel stay amazing.  The fact that it's not exactly on the strip was a non-factor for us, especially because of the free shuttles.  Also, it was so nice not to walk into a smelly casino every time we entered our hotel.  I am a picky girl, but I would highly recommend this hotel and I will be staying there again.

One more thing that's a little negative:  They charge $25\/night ""resort fee"".  Included in this fee are the shuttles, $25 in spa services and free wi-fi.  I hate paying these hidden resort fees, but it seems like it's standard for vegas hotels now a days.  At LEAST Wi-Fi is included.  But I'd still recommend this hotel, just factor in the extra $25\/day.",2,0,1

These are the things that I liked about the hotel:

1.)It was clean
2.)Location is good
3.)Price was decent
4.)Shuttle to the Wynn was handy since I had friends that were staying there
5.) The manager, Caroline was very sympathetic and accommodating. 
6.) The room was nice and the bed might have been the most comfortable I've ever slept in. 

What Went Wrong During My Stay at the Trump International Hotel, LV: 

1.) Came back after a long day and night of walking around town. Waited at least 35 min for the tub to fill up only to find out that the jets were broken. TOTAL BUMMER! 

2.) Ironing board with no cover: makes it kinda hard to iron. We asked for another one twice. The first time, we received a ripped cover, the second time a little, mini, doll house sized board that would make Ironing one of the many dresses I brought with me a chore. 

3.) Several lights were broken. One in the closet, one table lamp. 

4.) I signed a contract that stated I would be charged a maximum of $100\/ night for incidentals. Fine. Then I received another random charge that no one could explain or reverse. 

5.) Manager, Glenn was really icy when he told me that ""all hotels charge random incidental fees"".... even after I showed him a copy of the the signed Trump Document document which stated that I would only be charged $100\/night upon check in. 

6.) My friends who were staying at the Wynn tried to take the shuttle over to Trump to meet me for a drink but unfortunately, the driver drove right by them....even as they attempted to chase him down. During one of my shuttle rides, I overheard a couple complaining about the same thing. Guess the driver only stops if he feels like it?  

7.) Ordered a Mimosa to go from the bar. Bartender just gave me champagne at first, then when I corrected him, he ended up putting more OJ then there was bubbly! Their rookie bartenders don't even know how to make a simple drink. 

8.) Breakfast buffet - Was the cheap continental kind you get for free but they charged $20. Do yourself a favor and pay $15 more and eat at the Wynn. 

9.) Little to no cell reception. That could be ATT's fault. But my phone worked in other hotels for the most part. 

I think that's it. I wont stay here again and I will strongly advise all of my friends and family not to either!",12,0,0

This place left a bad taste in my mouth and I'm not sure if I will ever stay at a Trump hotel again.  This was the first time, to my knowledge, that I have stayed at a Trump Hotel and I had high expectations.  They claim to be a five star establishment and I strongly disagree.  If you are in Las Vegas for the sole purpose of business, then maybe it will satisfy you.  If you are coming to Vegas for Vegas, then stay away from this place.  There is no casino, no night club, and no smoking.  TRANSLATION: The place is dead and boring!  The room was okay, I would compare it to one of the better hotel chains like the Doubletree or Hilton.  In comparison to most high-end Casino\/Hotel rooms like the Palazzo, the room accomodations here look like a cheap Motel 6 room.  Their standard rooms only come with one king bed, and a very uncomfortable sofa pullout bed.  We asked the front desk if we could get an upgraded room with two beds, since I am male and I don't like sleeping with my male friend.  Hotwire books you the room without a bed preference.  They said the only rooms that had more than one bed were their penthouses and they are reserved.  They were really snobby about it too.

THIS PLACE IS NOT ON THE STRIP, ALTHOUGH HOTWIRE WILL SELL YOU A ROOM THERE AND SAY ITS ON THE NORTH END OF THE STRIP.  IF YOU WANT TO VISIT THE STRIP, EXPECT TO DRIVE, , TAKE A LONG WALK, PAY FOR A CAB, OR ATTEMPT TO GET ON THEIR RIDICULOUS SHUTTLE.  There is one pool and one jacuzzi for the entire hotel.  The pool\/jacuzzi is open from something like 8am-5pm which is utterly ridiculous.  The service, from the housekeeping to the front desk, was terrible!  There was no bedding for the pull out bed and we had to make repeated phone calls for about 45 minutes (seriously) to get the bedding.  This happened at the end of the night when we were ready to sleep.  We had to make a few other calls regarding problems with the room and went through the same thing.  There is no self parking, therefore forcing you to valet your vehicle and pay every time you get it in or out.  The resort fee is crazy!  How is this a resort?  Maybe because they give you two complimentary bottled waters and they have an expensive spa? There is a complimentary shuttle, which is actually a mini-van, that will transport you to The Wynn or the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace.  This ""shuttle"" runs from 9am-midnight.  The line is always long and you will never know how long you will have to wait.  If the shuttle fills up, you have to wait for the next one.  Also, keep in mind, the Forum Shops entrance is all the way at the back of Caesars Palace and the Wynn is not on the strip either.  SO ANNOYING!    I WILL NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, GO BACK TO THIS HOTEL AGAIN.  I visit Las Vegas on a regular basis and I will actually be afraid to use Hotwire again for fear I will get this hotel.",8,0,0

It's a break from the hustle and bustle of the usual casino hotel because there's no casino on the first floor, so you don't come out smelling like smoke when you get to your room. On the pool level, there's a fitness center (with complimentary waters) and a chic looking pool surrounded by a gold colored theme, overlooking the encore and wynn towers.  The rooms here are pretty awesome as well...has everything you need - plush down comforters on the bed, microwave\/fridge, even a TV built into the mirror.

The service here is incredible...probably the best seller.  The front desk was really helpful and friendly, and when I came in stumbling drunk without my room key, they were understandable and helped me out., instead of showing me to the door lol.  

If you ever stayed at the MGM signature, I would say this place rivals that hotel.  They both are good hotels.  Nevertheless, trump does a lot of the little things right, which makes it a good place to stay.",2,0,0

Cons:
No amenities,  only a single restaurant that is fairly spend, no cafe, no real bar, food at the

No place to get groceries for your kitchen in the hotel (even pop, snacks, etc)

Let's start with Trump Hotel. We were looking for a last-minute hotel to extend our 4th of July weekend an extra day, and ended up using Hotwire's blind booking service the night before, which ended up booking us for the Trump Hotel (~$145 before fees). When we arrived the next day at 3pm (check-in start time), we faced a 45-minute line. Okay. When we got to the front counter, the attendant declined us of a room because we were never in the system. She called her manager over the phone, and after the exchange, hung up and said to us 'sorry, there's nothing we can do for you. We are sold out. Would you like a bottle of water?' 

Great job, Trump. Oversell your damn hotel and screw us all (again). 

Anyways, we called Hotwire to complain about it, and while they f'ed up on their end as well, they at least put us up at the Aria hotel afterwards and covered the difference of $350. Biggest win of our trip!

Overall, can't say much about the actual hotel rooms or resort itself, but the greed and poor customer service will keep me from booking here again.",0,0,0

The room we stayed in was the City View Studio on the 19th floor.  I priceline-bid the rooms for $150 each and requested them to be adjacent to each other - the customer service rep was very helpful in ensuring that our two rooms were next to each other.  Our group was a younger crowd, and since the only clubs we were thinking about going to were in the Encore, the location of the Trump worked out to our advantage.  The walking distance to the Wynn\/Encore was not bad at all (about 3 blocks) and there was also a shuttle that conveniently took you to the Wynn and other hotels along the Strip. 

The service throughout the weekend was great for the most part, with a couple mishaps.  After our first night I requested that we have the rooms cleaned (because we had the do not disturb sign on throughout the morning) but when we got back from browsing the strip that evening nothing had been cleaned.  On top of that, we ordered some pizza one night and never actually received it (good thing I ordered to pay with cash!).  This was mainly because 1) the Trump does not allow delivery people into the hotel and 2) there was such bad cell phone reception inside\/throughout the hotel that the delivery guy was never able to reach me.  As a result we had to head over to Peppermill towards the north Strip to eat late night diner food.

Another thing that sucked was the valet parking, which was ""complimentary"" and required.  Nevertheless, the wait was on average 20-25 minutes, which was pretty horrible sometimes in the hot weather and only semi-shaded seating areas they got there.  One last downside was the fact that there was no casino in the hotel.  This is more an issue of preference, but since a good amount of people from our group wanted to gamble the distance plus the long wait for valet made it somewhat difficult to get to casinos in a timely manner.  

Overall, the Trump was definitely worth it for the price - the studio rooms are nicely furnished with a kitchenette, a fold-out queen sofabed and a very comfortable king size bed.  The bathroom had spacious shower and sink areas with small plasma TVs in the mirrors - a nice touch to the rest of the studio.  The attendants are all very friendly and helpful as well.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to families and couples that are looking to stay at a clean, relaxing place close to the Strip, but less so to larger groups or anyone that wants to enjoy more of what the Strip has to offer.",1,0,0

Update: I've been to more hotels in Vegas since this was written.  It doesn't deserve a 4, but it's closer to that than a 3.  3.5


Pluses:
  * Staff very good and friendly;
  * I had the base room, and it's big.  All tile bathroom with a bathtub\/hottub combo...nice!  Room, bed, sheets look and feel clean;
  * Gym included in the ""resort fee"";
  * internet access (wired and wireless) included in the ""resort fee"";
  * Reasonable price per night by Vegas standards;

Plus or minus, depending on the person:
  * non-smoking hotel;
  * No casino in the hotel;
  * valet parking only;

Minuses:
  * A little off the strip (some might not view that as a minus).  About a 10-15 minute walk outside the Trump before you get to the Strip;
  * Next to numerous lower-end strip-clubs (some might not view that as a minus, either :) ); 
  * My T-Mobile service was very poor in my room.  I've never run into that as an issue in any other Vegas hotel;
  * I was stunned to find out that room service would not charge my room for room service!  I ordered a meal and had to use my credit card instead of charging my room.  Not a biggie, but I've never run into that before, either;
  * subjective, but the lobby gives a ""tasteful by 1970s standards"" vibe.  A little too much gold, ever-so slightly tacky.  Plain yet tries a bit too hard to look expensive (I know, sounds contradictory.  You'd have to see it).  This is just the lobby, though; the room itself is fine;
  * mattress is...OK.  Not bad but I've been on better.  Sheets could use more fabric softener;   


The place is fine, but for my money (or my employers) I've been in nicer in better locations on the Strip for less money, if you look around (FWIW, Planet Hollywood Westgate is usually a little cheaper and the rooms and hotel are a little better).

Property is conveniently located right across the Wynn, so my drunk ass can walk from Tryst or XS back to my room without too much trouble, minus the 5-in heels I have on. Prices are super reasonable and you don't have to wreck your lungs by 2nd hand smoking for 10 min while you walk to your room, like you do when you stay at a casino hotel. This one is strictly just a hotel. The decor in the room is very tasteful and contemporary. All room are equipped with a small kitchenette and a jacuzzi (perfect for after all night of clubbing). 

Only downsides are the check-in line is very slow and the valet is also slow and there are no self-parking. Other than that, it's great!",5,4,4

We were kind of bummed at first but everything was great.  We checked in early and were able to upgrade to a suit for $50 more.  The rooms were very nice, clean and the bed was very comfortable.  We had no problem getting the double lounge chair by the pool but the bar\/resturant was under staffed and took a while for drinks.. Its a pretty small pool area but was nice bc it was smoke free!!

Customer service goes beyond all expectations!Room service is literally AT YOUR SERVICE in minutes. This hotel is not designed for the typical Vegas experience. It is designed to solely meet the needs of a business man---just like Donald Trump.,1,0,1

I confess we got this hotel due to an error in bidding on my part.  I accidentally added in the North Condo zone, and had an absolute hissy fit when I realized what I had done.   That being said there are some real pluses to staying here, and the price for a 5-star was pretty darn good, especially since it included a Saturday night. 

   Plus 1:  Much easier for a cab driver to get there and drop you off than a strip hotel.  We arrived on a very busy Saturday and the cab line looked like a popular Disney World ride queue.  Traffic was busy, yet we arrived quickly.
   Plus 2:  Fast fast fast check-in.  NO wait at a prime afternoon check-in time. Friendly too, with no snooty attitude that one can sometimes encounter when checking in prepaid via Priceline.
   Plus 3:  EASY, SHORT walk to your room.  A rarity in Vegas.  Save the miles for strip-walking.  (we sure did plenty of that, so being able to quickly get to our room when we got back each day was nice!)
   Plus 4:  Rooms are two per suite area, so you have the added security of an extra door.
  Plus  5:  JACUZZI.  Not just a boring big tub.  (let bubble bath search commence...but remember to only use a TEENY bit). 
  Plus 6:   Fridge (and other kitchen things that would only be a plus imho if we were staying longer than 3 nights).  
  Plus7:  Buttons by door that you can use to indicate privacy or housekeeping.  Very classy and worked like a charm.
  Plus 8:  Room service.  Top-notch.  Friendly.  Quick.  And surprisingly less expensive than I've seen in hotels in Vegas and other cities. We ordered a burger one night and it was good, with waffle fries, came with cute little bottles of mustard, ketchup and a teeny tiny Tabasco!  We had them bring up a corkscrew also, which we were surprised wasn't already in the room. 
  Plus 9:  Courtesy Shuttle.  We NEVER had to wait more than 2 minutes for it.  Drivers were very friendly.  Took us to either the Encore or a very convenient location at the Forum Shoppes.  (underground, with an escalator that comes out right in front of Spago). Never ever had such quick, friendly shuttle service at a hotel anywhere before!
  Plus 10:  Location isn't bad anyway.  Cross the street (be careful) and you are in the Fashion Mall  and on your way to wherever you want to go.  Note that there is an ABC store in the mall that has wine, munchies, sparkling water...pretty much anything you might need. Also note that when you come out of the mall on Las Vegas Blvd, that is where the Tix 4 Tonite booth is so you can see if you want any discount tix or meal discounts.  We bought Absinthe tix there, saved money on it, and the show was very entertaining!
   Plus 11:  Housekeeping...excellent!  Bless their hearts (see minuses 2-10 below)
  
  Minus 1:  No robes in room.  (easily rectified by a call to the front desk, also had extra towels brought up in anticipation of jacuzzi usage).
  Minus 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10:  The TOILET.  We HATED this toilet.  You can't tell me that Donald Trump or anyone in his family have ever used this toilet or one like it.  Heck our old ones here at home are considerably better.  It was the WORST toilet we have EVER had to deal with.  Now even though it was supposed to be Trump opulence, we didn't expect a golden throne or anything, but this porcelain puny had a plastic lid (no big deal, but unexpected in a 5-star).... the PROBLEM was that it would barely flush.  I realize the idea is to save energy, water, etc., but how much of a savings is it when you have to flush 3 times (waiting in between each time for the tank to fill up)?  Not only was the suckage power non-existent, but there was no water that would go around the basin, making flushing fairly useless, beyond frustrating and flat-out embarrassing at times.  God help Housekeeping here!  (Hope everyone believes in tipping Housekeeping like we do). 
  Minus 11:  The view. If you get ""city view"" like we did, it means a view of the Erotic Heritage Museum (which doesn't seem to get any traffic), and other such lovely landmarks.  Not a biggie to us as we didn't spend much time in the room, but if it's important to you ask for a different view.  
  Minus 12:  The train.  I'm only putting this as a minus because I know it would bother a lot of folks.  To us having spent a year and a half dealing with downtown DC noises, it was no big deal.  But yes it would wake us up several times each night.

   Overall impressions...this hotel feels more like 4 stars than 5. Whereas service was definitely 5-star in all regards (front desk, housekeeping, shuttle drivers, room service, security guard in lobby)... furniture, bedding, etc. was more 4-star than 5.  Toilet alone makes it impossible to rate it a 5.  It feels like a 4-star hotel that could be in any city anywhere.  There's nothing that cries out VEGAS RESORT.  And THAT is a plus or minus depending on how you look at it.",3,3,3

This hotel is probably one of my favorite experiences when it comes to hotels. When you pull up to valet, they guys are there to great you and open both doors that enter into the lobby for you. Then when you get into the lobby, it smells of class. Such a beautiful design. Check in easy, courteous, and quick. 

The views from the rooms are great! The building looks down both sides of the strip. I stayed in a standard room with a king size bed. There is a little living room setup with a kitchen and TONS of closet space. The bathroom is outstanding. You'd think there is two showers, but one door goes to the shower and the other to the toilet. Very discrete if your with someone else. They also have a huge tub w\/ jets. Don't know what to do while in the tub? No problem!! There is a tv built into the bathroom mirror.

Positive
Rooms are spacious with a large bathroom. TV inside the mirror in the powder room. Beautiful views of the strip. Heated pool and awesome fitness room. Complimentary water and valet service. Fresh squeezed orange juice was delicious and you can never go wrong with starbucks coffee. Hotel shampoo and conditioner are larger bottles that smell very good. The shower is huge and the bed is very comfortable. 

Negative 

We checked in and noticed a very loud wind noise in the room. When we called the front desk they said its common because it's windy out. We requested someone come look and they sent an engineer who already had replacement parts in hand when he entered. He explained the vent was broken and he replaced it which immediately dulled the wind noise. He said its common for this hotel and has a few more rooms to go to with the same issue. 

Room service food quality was very poor. Pizza appeared to be frozen with small amount of toppings. Calamari, I could have made at home from a frozen bag. Very oily sautéed spinach. 

Shower temperature was finicky. It was either scaling hot or super cold. Too lengthy period to get water temp to my liking. Similar issues with my friends in a neighboring room. 

Minor Stains on the curtains and major on the carpet when you enter the room. 

Hotel manager delivered our baggage then proceeded to disclose that the train is very loud when passing the hotel. Boy was he right. Once at night and early morning the training sounded its horn and wow we got out of bed early. I'm not sure if the hotel will remedy that eventually in the future, but had we known about the train we probably wouldn't have stayed in this hotel. 

Over all we had a pleasant experience. We were not in the hotel much but for 190 a night we get what we pay for.

One month later I found out Trump charged my credit card for two room for two nights. I called them to argue about it.

You couldn't escape the feeling that they were trying to screw you over at every possible turn. Examples that jump to mind include lack of housekeeping services (these are available if you're willing to pay an extra fee) or selling you five dollar bananas at the entrance instead of giving them away for free. The rooms might be five star-quality at this place but I've been treated better at a roadside motel.

Walking into the Lobby area I was underwhelmed.  It's a very boring, basic lobby. In addition, the hotel sells pastries and drinks from a cart. It looks odd and doesn't fit my expectations of luxury,  the rooms are quite sizable especially the bathroom.  For the size of the shower, I expected  multiple shower jets. However, there is a single one and the hot water never stays quite hot. In addition, one of our sinks didn't drain properly.  The hotel is really more like a condo or timeshare. Except a timeshare normally has silverware, glasses and plates for use. There is lots of cabinet space, but they were empty. In addition, there wasn't a mini bar but a small refrigerator. Not that those items bothered us, but if the look and feel is a timeshare then have the normal timeshare amenities. We didn't get our room cleaned one day. I guess it's because we didn't have the housekeeping light turned on. So make sure that you do that if you want your room cleaned. There is a shuttle bus that takes you to Either Caesar's  or Wynn. They will tell you that a shuttle runs every 8 min but it's more like 20. Would I stay here again,? Probably  not. I want the option of a casino. Plus it's off the strip.

I have to say that I was a little surprised to learn that there was no casino.  But, I chose to go anyway.  It's Vegas.  It's Trump.  What the hell.
So we got to the hotel and the bellman\/valets greeted us in usual fashion.  Walk into the lobby, it smells refreshing (unlike all of the stale smoke in other hotels) and we're greeted by yet another person who directs us to the check-in counter.  We check in swiftly and go up to our one bedroom suite.  You know you're in a nice hotel when they have a double entrance to your room!  This greatly keeps out the hallway noise even though there was none because I think the hotel was pretty empty!  But you get my point.  
I've been in a lot of nice hotels, but this is one of the nicest.  Fully stocked kitchen with granite counters, Sub Zero frig, Bosch stove, etc.  We didn't use it, but hey, it's nice ok?   
Full size dining room table and huge couch and plasma TV in the living room.  Bedroom is pretty large with another plasma and the bathroom is as large as a one bedroom studio apartment!  2 person shower, jacuzzi bathtub, separate room to drop off the boys at the pool, marble everywhere.   Oh yeh, and the TV in the mirror is a nice touch.  There is also another marbled-out full bathroom off of the living room.   Bed was nice and plush and sheets were lux.  
It's located one block off the strip, so that's a minus.  If you're walking back from the Wynn or Venetian or somewhere close at night with wads full of cash, take a cab back!  That one block is pretty dark and feels like you're walking into an ambush!  But that's me.

There's no casino in here which may be a deciding factor for some, but I kind of like just the hotel experience without all the noise and smoke.

I could live here! It's bigger than this shabby abode I call studio I'm in in Philadelphia.  The suit is more than well equipped with a full kitchen and a stainless steel refrigerator.  There's a microwave, dishwasher, blender, and dining sets.  The kitchen counter seats two and there's s small table that seats four.  The couches are very nice and comfortable and it even pulls out.  

The floor to ceiling windows it amazing.  You can see outside but people can't see inside . 

There are two bathrooms.  One in the dining\/living room area (shower, toilet, sink) and one in the master room.  The master bathroom has a full sized shower and a separate jet tub.  Watch out when you get out of the shower\/tub because the beautiful marble floor is slippery.  There even is a toilet there with its own stall and a telephone . It gets better:  the bathroom mirror has a screen built in so you can either watch TV or enjoy the view of LV.

The room also comes with cashmere robes that's so soft I feel like I'm wearing an alpaca.  The bed is so comfortable and amazing to wake up in because the first thing you'd see is the sun rise over the peaks.

The room service was also impressive.  We got the ribeye and it was cooked to perfection.  BUT they forgot the grilled onions and we tasted no truffle in the cold mashed potatoes.  The side Mac and cheese was very creamy and quite tasty, but had a very soupy consistency.  They bring you little bite sized bottles of Tabasco and A1 sauce.

The pool was great.  It only goes to maybe 4 ft so it's very user friendly to those who cannot swim such as myself.  The pool side food wasn't too shabby either.  We tried the waffle fries topped with cheese and shredded pork.  They could have layered the fries and toppings, but most places don't anyway.

There is a resort fee that is charged above and beyond the room fee.  Long check in line but they did serve ice cold bottles of water and offered 5 minute chair massages.  Nice touch.  Check in time is 3PM (we got to the front desk at 3:15PM).  Check out time is 4PM... thus our suite was not ready.  We had to sit in the lobby for 30 minutes and wait for our room to be ready.  We had to get back on the line to get room keys.  The second person who helped us upgraded us to a corner suite.  Beautiful room.  We met the housekeeper on the way to the room - truly wonderful lady!!  Room was neat and clean and HUGE! 

The three young men in the room next to us were causing minor problems (nothing too bad by Vegas standards) but Trump took guest complaints very seriously!!!  Two security guards and one manager showed up quickly and the problem folks were removed from the hotel.  

No casino, no real restaurant (few seats in ""living room style"" atmosphere), no real commotion - nice quiet luxury hotel.  We visited the bar once - great signature martini's and nice service.

I applaud his efforts, as the hotel seems swanky upon arriving. So swanky, in fact, when we booked the hotel the site we booked through forgot to declare the $100 per night incidentals fee, to be charged UP FRONT, and to be refunded on check out. Sadly we both didn't have enough to cover that after booking the hotel, flights, and factoring in meals, etc. We had quite the hour of waiting in the lobby as we contacted the booking provider. After a lot of uncertainty the hotel was willing to waive the fee after the booking provider made a phone call to the Trump Management. I felt very relieved and just wanted to begin to enjoy our vacation in luxury. Our room was beautiful, spacious, and had a killer Jacuzzi tub. The view was decent, but the hotel is near a lot of undeveloped areas, so I kept looking to the distance of the pretty mountains.

We made a trip to a local store for some food to prepare in our awesome little kitchen in our room. Then quite possibly the second worst part of the stay was discovering a used condom wrapper in our SILVERWARE organizer. Now one would think after a guest checks out, the silverware, plates, pots, and glasses are all REPLACED or at least inspected for cleanliness. I am curious how the empty condom wrapper from some young lovers heated night before our stay, ended up getting left in our silverware drawer, not to mention touching our silverware. 

It took the staff a little while to bring us dish soap and robes, but we are thankful they brought them for our convenience. The bed made for a divine sleep, and we didn't spend too much time away from our room. Location isn't terrible, nothing you can't pump some blood and get a good exercise out of.

The one bedroom suite features a full kitchen, table for 4, and large L-shaped couch in the sitting area. The kitchen appliances were certainly 5 star but the furniture (especially the couch and lamps) was a bit dated and not up to par with the rest. You could save a bundle by stocking up at the grocery store and cooking yourself, but who wants to do that on vacation in Vegas? It really is a nice kitchen.

Pros: excellent service from all staff, great bathrooms with immediate hot water in the spacious dual head shower, best\/fastest elevators I have ever seen, quick room service, fast wifi with easy setup, nice view of the strip, comfortable bed and pillows, plenty of towels and toiletries. Very tranquil scene without loud\/rowdy partiers since this hotel is well off the strip, except for....

Cons: EXTREMELY ANNOYING train whistle several times a night, even from the strip side high on the 50th floor. Also frequent sirens from the street at all times of night. I don't know if it's just the part of town, the area acoustics, or what, but I never noticed noise like that at the Bellagio or even the Rio. It is guaranteed that you will hear these things, and clearly...how much it bothers you is more individual. It bothered me a lot, and for this reason alone I would not stay here again. The lack of casino was also a con for me...but for some I'm sure it's a plus. The distance to the strip was an issue for me; walking is not really a reasonable option. It is a lot farther than it looks from your room. The shuttle to Caesars was not too inconvenient, but it would have been a lot more convenient to just stay at Caesars. Want to freshen up before dinner or get some more cash from your safe? It's a long way back to your room.

Everything is fantastic, just like The Donald would say.  Seriously, have you ever counted how many times he uses that word in just a 30 second timespan?

I immediately felt welcomed upon approaching the entrance here.  When I was in the lobby this continued, and upon checking in, once I yanked out my Expedia Elite card (too bad we don't get physical cards for being Yelp Elites too) they became even more welcoming, took me to the lounge, upgraded my room, extended my check-out time til 4, etc.  As for the check-in process, no, they didn't ask for my birth certificate as my form of ID (2nd Donald reference). Anyway, some of the friendliest service I've ever encountered upon checking in anywhere.

The room was, let me think of a word...how about, fantastic?  Almost made me want to stay in, since I had just arrived from a business meeting and it was 105 outside. I could barely believe that this huge room was all mine for the price, other hotels I checked out before booking were charging more than double.

Highlights include great decor, a decent view (since it's further down from the Strip, the main window view is of The Wynn), spacious, lots of drawers not just to pack your belongings away in but also already storing kitchen accessories, etc., an amazing tub\/jacuzzi in the bathroom with a TV that's in the mirror, and the couches create a nice lounge area away from the bed. Basically, I had more than I needed, but I'm not complaining.

When I turned on the TV, the monitor had my name on it, but I'm surprised it had CNN as a channel since their ratings are so low (3rd Donald reference).

As for everything outside the room, the pool area was pretty basic but packed with lots of staff (will review the H2 EAU poolside dining later), the fitness center was fantastic, and The Salon was quite tempting, although I didn't see The Donald hairdo as an option on the menu (4th Donald reference).  I also like the fact this hotel has no casino, it's good to be able to have this place as an option to stay away from that scene.  The gift shop was pretty simple though.

The second day there the staff didn't seem as welcoming, like when I stepped outside they didn't offer me a cab until minutes later, and some others didn't appear as enthusiastic as those from the day before.  I don't know if it's because on the day I arrived I was dressed in my business attire, and on the following day I just had a t-shirt and shorts on, or it may have just been chance.

So, they almost got a 5 star review out of me, which would have been...fantasticest.

There is no chaos that comes with a casino + hotel.  If I was going to return to Vegas next month, this hotel will be one of my top choices.

THE MAJOR PLUS OF THIS PLACE IS THE PROPERTY IS STRICTLY NON-SMOKING.

When you sign the terms and conditions, it clearly states the hotel will charge you a $250 refresh fee if you smoke in the rooms.  Whether this is pointed out or not, this is the major reason to stay at this hotel if you are a non-smoker like me.

If you book on Hotwire like I did, you do not get Trump credits but one of the benefits about the property highlighted is that it is SMOKE-FREE.  If you book at the Trump website, it states the rooms are large and non-smoking.

For those that cannot understand this, the only thing I have to say is DUH.

Check in was quick and friendly.  My room was not ready so I waited in the lobby for about 15 minutes while the current rooms queued up were going through inspection.

After I got my keys, I went up to the 32nd floor and noticed your room is door is actually behind one big doors.  You open the big door with your key card and see 2 more doors.  One of them is your room.  I would say this is a plus because you are insulated from the noisy people walking the halls.  Negative about this is that if the other room is occupied, you could potentially hear their door slamming but for me, it was empty.

My room was missing a robe.  The MANDATORY resort fee here was $25 per day.  It includes free coffee pods, 2 bottle of waters a day, electronic access to magazines or newspapers on your iPad, and WI-FI or internet (no limit on devices).

The gym is ok and closes late.  For a business traveler, it is a good place to get some rest.

The room has a refrigerator (empty) that you can use for free [Venetian\/Palazzo, take note].  Plus a stove and microwave.

The beds were comfortable but I did notice some things that prevented me from rating this property 5 stars:

1.  Layer of dust under the toaster
2.  Light socket in lamp is broken
3.  Shades are manual, not electronic
4.  Freight train horn in the morning
5.  Sink and tub not cleaned to my standards

The rooms have a large bathroom, with jacuzzi style tub, double sinks, and large shower.  Plenty of space to store your clothes and there is a safe in the room.

Parking is valet only but you can park across the street at the Fashion Show Mall in the garage by Nordstroms.  There is a free shuttle to the Wynn\/Encore.  I was able to get in and out of the hotel real quickly.  This is a big plus.  It didn't matter if I was crossing the street to the garage or walking to the strip.

The major plus of this property is that it is NON-SMOKING.  I don't understand why some people will go into a room that is smoke-free and light up.  Do you know that you stink up the room for the next person?

I have always stayed at one of the hotels on the main part of the Strip, so at first I was a little wary of staying on the edge at Trump. I am SO glad that we did, though. Because Trump doesn't have a casino and is nonsmoking, the experience was just way more relaxed - and we were still able to go to other hotels for restaurants and clubs! The staff at Trump is excellent and everyone we interacted with was super professional, courteous and just plain friendly. The rooms are large and clean, and I absolutely adore the deep tubs in the bathrooms. We spent Saturday by the pool and reserved a cabana, something I highly recommend doing. The pool is low key but the music is great, and Sebastian (the person helping us) was the best! My only complaint is that the cabanas are poorly designed - the AC is positioned in such a way that it actually sends cold air OUT of the cabana instead of into it...weird. We also ate a lot of food at Trump, both in the restaurant area downstairs and through room service. Room service was AMAZING (get the onion rings!) - I highly recommend ordering in after a long night, they serve 24 hrs. The breakfast downstairs was stellar too - I loved the crab cake eggs benny. Overall this was just a great experience and I will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas!",2,0,0

Positives:
-The place is beautiful (but so are most hotels on the Vegas Strip)
-Relatively reasonable price. BF and I stayed during Labor Day Weekend and the price was much better than the nearby hotels
-NO CASINO. Obviously, this would not be a positive for some people, but for me it was a huge selling point
-Location. Again, not a positive for many people, but I liked that we were able to get away from the strip craziness. It is a pretty sketchy walk from the strip, especially at night, so ladies make sure you have your man with you
-The bathroom is awesome. You get a huge walk-in shower AND a jacuzzi tub big enough for 4 full sized humans.  
-Suite is very spacious. Loved the king sized bed and the sofa. All suites have a little kitchenette with plates\/utensils and a cute little tea pot.

Negatives:
-The $25\/day ""resort"" fee is weird. I didn't use the spa\/resort so I'm not really sure what I was paying for
-The food at the restaurant was extremely expensive for sub-par quality
-Loud
-No self parking, only valet. BF and I arrived on a motorcycle, which obviously can't be valet parked, so BF had to run up and down the driveway to park himself

I love how the lobby actually smells like honeysuckle instead, it was a wonderful scent to come back to.

The staff were generally courteous and nice, though some where a bit aloof and cold, we did meet three really nice valet\/cab guys during our stay. The rooms are decent sized for suites, and the bed simply AMAZING. I was tempted to steal the mattress and take it home, but it was my friend's credit card info they had downstairs, so I had to resist. But it was definitely one of the most comfortable beds I've slept on. Housekeeping was quick to bring up whatever we requested (extra towels, blanket) and room service was quick, efficient, and courteous. The jets on the tub were awesome, and it was big enough for me to stretch out comfortably too.

Some of the things that I didn't like as much, which brings it down to 3 stars:
--internet is $12.99 a day. seriously? the Signature at MGM provides complimentary internet, and they're also an all-suite building like Trump. and not quite as far away too.
--it is at the end of the strip, off the strip. It is near the newer casinos, ie wynn\/encore, but a bit far for walking to caesar\/bellagio. and i don't remember if there was an actual sidewalk to walk on towards wynn, but you can go to nordstrom right across the street at the fashion mall. we cabbed everything, which wasn't bad since we were splitting the cost amongst several people. but if you want convenient access to the strip, it may be a bit far for you.
--the toiletries are sub par. maybe this is too minuscule  to actually complain about, but this is Trump international. Donald Trump is putting his name on it, and he's gonna provide his guests with cheap no-name shampoo\/conditioner? I've received Bvlgari toiletry products from Mandalay Bay, Trump can do better.

but probably most importantly --- our hotel room door did not close\/lock. anyone could open it without a key, just turn the stupid knob and push. we let housekeeping and concierge downstairs know about it, but no one came up to fix it. it was like this during out entire stay. we weren't offered the option of switching to another room, which any other hotel would have offered if they couldn't fix the problem, cuz i mean, how unsafe is THAT? but nope, nothing was done. thank goodness nothing was stolen, but we made sure to take the important stuff (credit cards, ids, etc) with us when we left the room. and i guess it was some comfort that there was a guy downstairs checking everyone for room keys to enter the elevators....but shame on you Trump! That was one big no-no. I'm guessing this is an isolated incident, since no one else on yelp complained about this, but they should have resolved this matter ASAP, and been a bit more concerned about its patrons' safety.",0,0,0

The bed was extremely comfortable and everything within the room seemed very new and up to date.  The bathroom was definitely the show-stopper here.  A stand-in shower, TV built into the mirror, and large Jacuzzi tub made me almost just want to chill in the bathroom for a few hours, lol.  The room was spacious to say the least and it was more than enough for two people.

I did not check out the other amenities, but did stop by the bar for a drink late at night.  The bartenders were classy and very knowledgeable about their cocktails.  They were able to recommend some great drinks just based off of a short conversation of what we generally liked. 

The only negative thing I could say about this place is its relative location on the Strip.  It is more or less at the very north-end of the Strip so it'll take some walking \/ cabbing to get to where you want to go.

This was my first time staying at a trump hotel so I was excited to see what this five star hotel had to offer. I am first going to go over the pros and then the cons. 

Pros
- location: Although it is on the upper north side I found this location perfect for my needs. Across the street is a mall with plenty of food and shopping . In the morning I found the Nordstrom cafe extremely satisfying which is only a 2 minute walk from hotel. 

- Shuttle service: trump offers a free shuttle service to The Wynn, Venetian, and I believe Ceasers.

Room service: Very quick and polite staff. Food was up to our room within 15 minutes. Waters were brought within ten minutes. 

Room: The room was big and comfortable with kitchenette. 

CONS 

Bathroom: Shower head was not the best. Bathtub jets were not working. Bathtub was a good size and sinks were nice.

Cleanliness: found a dirty sock under dresser. A lot of dust under dresser as well. The room was clean besides under dresser and bed.

Ice machine : ice machine on our level was not working had to go to another floor.


Overall I would not rate this a five star hotel. I would rather stay at the Wynn, Aria, Cosmo, or even the Signature of the Trump hotel.

Yes only if I got a really good deal.

Had a nice view of the Sierra Nevada mountains, and the room was super spacious and super clean! It also had a Fridge, stove, microwave, keurig, and tons of closet and drawer space. We had 2 queen beds that were super comfy. There were also 2 wall units that had small sculptures\/artwork, as well as books.

City View Studio, Room 3320

Returning to Trump but disappointed to find its service subpar for a luxury-class hotel. Maybe my last visit set the bar too high. Well, I was impressed with trump's high level of comfort and service last night and hoped it will stay that way. Not really.

** ""Highlights"" **

*Room 3320 was a city view suite. The room was comfortable and cozy just like last time. But the faucet of the jacuzzi came loose like a rocket when I turned on hot water. Since I was not in a hurry to use the jacuzzi, and it was almost midnight (we checked in at 11pm), I decided to leave a note for the maid the next day. Faucet was promptly fixed but the jacuzzi itself didn't turn on. It was broken. So that was that.

*Trump charges a $25 resort fee per day for pool\/fitness facility, free wifi, bottled water and other room amenities. On our last full day stay, that was July 5th, neither our bottled water nor the coffee were replenished.

*Trump has a nice pool, not too big, but decent enough. I decided to reserve a day bed for two. For $75 you have the day-bed, which is a wicker round bed thingy with cushion, a fruit tray, and iced bottled water. We found the day bed some of the most uncomfortable thing to sit or lay on. The umbrella didn't block you completely from the sun. It looks like perfect for two people but no. So the pool manager transferred us to the FREE chaise lounge on the other size of the pool and refunded the $75. So skip the day bed and don't waste your money. They just don't have enough umbrellas for everyone. So my pool time is cut short. When it gets slightly gusty, they put down the umbrellas and you just sit in the sun like rotisserie chicken.

*The overall service is nothing like my last visit. No door man opening the door. The front pick-up\/loading area is completely chaotic with at least 15 cars parked. I had to walked out to hail a cab. Their free shuttle to Wynn\/Caesar Palace always had a huge line and there was never one waiting there.

*My impression is that Trump is not prepared to handle the huge volume of guests arriving during the 4th of July weekend. There were people hounding all over the lobby and main entrance. 

I am impressed with the staff that I have interacted with during the stay. They are friendly and courteous. The pool staff and the crew at the H2(Eau) are very attentive and professional, always striving to make us comfortable. The housekeeping staff always greet us with a smile.

Overall I'm not impressed this time because everything that impressed me last time was no more. The hotel is still non-gaming so there is no cigarette here which is still a plus. But with this degradation of service it no longer separates itself as the hotel to be. I booked this trip through United Vacations and the hotel room came to $170 a night (which is actually more than last time with much better service). Next time I would consider Wynn instead.",3,1,3

Its gold so I thought it would be maybe a bit cheesy and Donald Trumpesque but it was not. 

No smoking & no casino means no crazy at your feet when you try to leave. Go find the crazy and then return home to a fresh smelling hotel. 

And unlike those big casino hotel I always knew where the exit was. 

Let us check in hours early with a warm welcome and a cold bottle of water. Door people are the sweetest. Funny, nice and treat you so well. Pool is no scene which is fine with me. Never ate there so I can not say about that. Upgraded to a 1 bed corner suite on the 51st floor. Huge for all of us. Big kitchen, 2 full bathrooms, great (=big) lotions and shower stuff. Comfy bed. Cozy, if a bit well worn, robes. Strip view from the awesome deep jetted tub. 

Railway track in the back were not a big deal. Make sure the vent strip on your window is closed so the noise in minimal. Stayed 3 nights and barely heard the train ever. Who sleeps in Vegas anyway? 

Location wise it is great. Off strip- sure- but a 7 min walk to Wynn\/Strip or take the fast shuttles to the Wynn or Caesar's if you have your cute shoes on. One morning they just drove us to breakfast to make sure we were safe (....it was 5 am...). Right across the street is the Nordstrom's entrance. Enter the mall here for food like CPK or Starbucks or really any store you need. 

The loss of star was for Housekeeping. They totally forgot us one day. The resort fee covers your bottled water and such but with no housekeeping we did not get any that day. Minor but not cool. 

I will stay here again. Its no scene and I found I liked that. If you are younger, like between 21-29, then this is most likely not your place. Otherwise I think you'd be pleasantly surprised.",0,0,0

They're spacious, well designed and have plenty of storage, which is key for me since I tend to pack heavy. Plus, the bed was very comfortable, housekeeping was thorough and wireless internet access was free and reliable.  

The bathroom was beautiful - marble everything with privacy glass separating the toilet and shower areas. The spa tub was great! My 6'5"" husband was able to fit easily and I felt like I could have swum laps! 

I didn't eat at the hotel but the restaurant looks fairly small by Vegas standards. I also didn't use the pool and fitness center, or visit the spa, so I can't review those amenities.

The two negatives we're location (see below) and the overwhelming floral scent when you walk into the otherwise killer lobby.

Though I had a great stay, I likely won't return to the Trump due to its location. It's nowhere near a LV monorail stop and cabs don't come out there as often as there isn't a casino or show to attract fares. Plus, the additional cab fares I racked up traveling along the strip completely ate up the step nightly rate discount I secured via Priceline.

I say sublime because the level of good taste and sophistication that oozzes from the joint is beyond most people's comprehension.  From the fragrant lobby to the Le Crueset tea kettle in the kitchen no detail is spared.  And it has just the right amount of bling to remind you that are in a Trump hotel and secondly that you are in Sin City.

The staff is exceptionally well trained and again, top shelf. With a level of customer service unsurpassed by Bellagio, Wynn or Palazzo and it shines a bright ligth on how bad customer service is in LA.  They kissed our butts, in a good way though, it was very sincere and friendly.  They made us feel like, well, Donald Trump himself without going over board.  It all just seemed very intimate and natural.

I will say that the gal at the desk in the spa didn't seem to be cut from the same cloth but why are spa desk girls so snotty anyway.? Because she didn't even seem to try to make me feel welcomed, I cancelled my appointment.

We didn't get to try DJT, the house restaurant because it was closed on Monday.  

I recommend the suite, just below the penthouse, on the 45th floor.  It's on the corner and you get breathtaking views of the strip from the living room, the bedroom and the spa-tub.

My friend that I came with is actually a regular.

The hotel is spacious, bright, clean, welcoming and pretty to look at.
Good place for those of you who don't like casinos, cause this is a hotel only.

Prices are fair and reasonable.
Rooms are spacious.
Beds, pillows and blankets are super comfortable.
Bathrooms are huge, love the walk in shower and hot tub.
They offer complimentary hygiene kit if requested. Comes with toothbrush, toothpaste, and comb.
Our room came with a mini fridge.
And a kitchenette stocked with cooking supplies and utensils and cups if you wanted to cook.
Complimentary coffee and water! Always need water!

Not to mention that we learned that Trump Hotel has their OWN DRIVERS!
But there's not too many available, but if you can get one, they'll take you anywhere you choose, and you pay them depending on how much you think you should, not by mileage, which is awesome as well.

We came to town to meet up with family, and neither of us are really  ""party people"" at this point so we wanted somewhere that was  off strip, quiet, accessible, and relaxing. Trump LV delivered on all these points. 

All of our interactions with staff (front desk, lobby, bellhop, valet) were very friendly and the complementary valet system (no self parking) was fast and efficient. 

Our room was on the 49th floor and the fast shuttle elevators zoomed us up there with very little wait. The view wasn't really anything to write home about during the day - but at night it twinkled with all the city lights and it was really pretty. We could hear the train horns at night; but it wasn't really anything that ruined our stay, and to be honest if we were asleep we slept right through them. 

Our room was set up much like a studio apartment with a sitting and sleeping area, small kitchenette (with sink, fridge, and built in hot plate). It also came with a Kurig and a toaster. It was awesome to  be able to go to the store and get some food that we could take back to the room for late night munchies or a morning snack; my family stayed at the Luxor and did  not have any of these amenities in their room. 

The bed was amazingly comfortable and we had some of the best sleep that we have had away from home. My mom was impressed and was convinced that the mattress at TLV was better than the one she has at home.

The bathroom had his and hers sinks as well as a very large standing shower, separate toilet area, and big deep jetted tub. The tub was perfect for a relaxing soak at the end of the night and was so big that lengthwise I couldn't touch both sides (I'm 5'7). The mall across the street had plenty of stores and a Lush beauty where I picked up enough bath bombs to have several relaxing nights. There were plenty of hand and body towels, so we never had to ask for more.

We didn't partake but we did stop by the pool and fitness area and both were clean and the pool looked wonderful. A perfect suntrap, but also a wonderful place to relax. Trump hotel doesn't have an attached casino, and seemed to cater to the more relaxed crowd as opposed to the party crowd.

It was only a small walk from the strip and they also had a complementary shuttle van service that ran to the Wynn and to Cesars. All in all it was a wonderful stay at a very good price and I would recommend TLV.",8,3,3

I agree with the reviews that note that the lack of casino and party atmosphere give the Trump a relaxed atmosphere for non-party people. That was nice. However, even if you are going to LV for luxury and shopping (which I was), in my opinion this is not the place and for just a little more money you can get soooo much more at the Palazzo or Venetian, for example. 

First impressions
Bad: You approach the hotel with an abandoned parking lot as your entrance view. Not hopeful.
Good: The valet, bell, and check-in staff all were very nice and efficient.

The Room
Bad: It was, well, gross. I recently had to stay in student housing where I was afraid to touch anything. I felt the same thing here. Except the student housing was cheap, and this cost a ton. The carpet was disgusting--stained with a huge wet spot near the bed and a business card for ""Girls to You"" left under a chair from the last guest. The styling was dated and dirty--the curtain had what appeared to be a blood stain on it. I did not like the story this room was telling me! The air conditioning was anemic and noisy. There was train noise throughout the night.

Good:
No minibar? I guess that is good. A full kitchen--maybe this place is aimed more at conference goers and business people? Bathroom is large & overall nice, but I have seen larger & nicer in LV for same price and no way was I going into the jacuzzi tub.

Other:
The resort fee which pretty much covered the pool, wifi, and free mini waters. I did not try the spa, which may be lovely. I ate at DJT which was ok. The staff, again, were excellent. The food was expensive-ish ($17-40) but just ok. Vegetables cooked in a schizophrenic way--some mushy and some raw. Potatoes the consistency of those stove-top potato flake mixes. $9.00 for a bottle of water.

I don't mean  to be a total hater on the place, but I last stayed at the Palazzo for basically the same amount (with a smaller resort fee!) and it was drop-dead gorgeous, amazing, over-the-top luxury. The Trump room was dirty, dated, and kind of tragically sad looking.",0,0,0

I had booked a 2 BR Strip View Suite and decided to head over at 2 PM despite getting into McCarren at 10 AM.  They have you check in at the VIP area just off the main registration desk and, upon my arrival, the room was cleaned and ready to go.  The only hold-up was that a 'higher up' needs to inspect that room prior to checking in and I waited 40 minutes until someone inspected it.

I didn't really care at all aside from wanting to get out of the clothes I traveled in and to get the room situated, but my feeling was that a 'VIP' should get priority over the little people in the world (like, say, the people who booked a regular room or even a 1 BR).  This room wasn't cheap and it was degrading seeing the other people carrying their bags to their hotel room before me.

I was totally kidding about that last bit, so give me a break.

All I can say about this place is that it's hard to get a Five Stars for anything.  'Robocop' is Five Stars.  Many 'Gin's' are Five Stars.  I don't know what a hotel would have to do to get it, but I can say that I've been going to Las Vegas three + times a year for nearly two decades and this was the nicest room I'd ever stayed in.

64th Fl, smack-dab looking south down the middle of Las Vegas Blvd.  Aside from not having a CD player or a MP3 player that could connect to the newest generation of ipod, it had every amenity and so much space.  Probably too much space for a couple of drunkard college buddies, but I'd look to book this room every time I'm back in town.

The hotel is immaculate and the employees across the board couldn't be better, nicer or more accommodating.

The closest casino is the Wynn\/Encore, but I walked\/stumbled to and from as far south as Paris without issue.  You're in Vegas, you're going to walk (they have courtesy shuttles to Wynn and to Caesars).  The Riviera and the Gold Standard of trashy casinos, Circus Circus, is just a quick skip north.

I highly recommend this place.  I've read some reviews and people have spoke of trains (never heard one although I wasn't on the side of the hotel I believe that affects) and the valet service not being fast enough 9didn't have a car)...but I think people are just high maintenance.

Can't wait to stay here again.",1,1,1

The hotel is clean and smells great. The staff is courteous and accommodating. We stayed in a standard room with two beds and a Strip view. The rooms, including the bathroom, were spacious and clean.

We don't mind walking at all, so we actually enjoyed walking across the street to the Fashion Show Mall and down the street to Las Vegas Boulevard.

We stayed on the 31st floor and we did hear the train in the middle of the night for about 20 seconds. I don't think it was a big deal and probably wouldn't have even noticed it if I didn't read previous reviews.

Be aware if you book the room through another website and put occupancy of ""4"", you will be given a room with a king and a pullout sofa. There is $25\/night fee to have a room with two beds, which we needed. I don't mind paying it, but just disclose the fee (just like the resort fee) before I book so I'm not hit with the charge at the front desk.

I would have no hesitation staying here again for the rate we got and would recommend the hotel for anyone looking for something a little different than other hotels directly on Las Vegas Boulevard.",0,0,0

We felt the difference as soon as we walked in. No long check-in lines filled with tourists sporting Disney shirts and fanny packs. Everyone was dressed to the nines here, ready to impress and boast (oh yeah, there was a lot of boasting by the pool area). When our bell boy arrived at our spacious suite, we suddenly heard a train rattle so loudly I thought we were right on the train tracks. The front desk was called immediately, they apologized and moved us to a suite that was facing away from train tracks - phew, no waking up at 6am!

The suite itself was great. It was equipped like a studio apartment, there was a kitchenette with burners, a sub-zero fridge, a microwave and all sorts of kitchen utensils. My favorite was the bathroom. My eyes popped when I saw the massive jacuzzi tub. It was deep enough that my uber-tall boyfriend could actually fit in it and have his knees submerged in the water. The shower was also very spacious and I loved the fact that we had two sinks.

You definitely understand why people buy suites or stay for extended times at the Trump when you see their state-of-the-art gym. I expected a couple of cardio machines and a weight rack. Wrong! There were about 50 pieces of equipment and the gym looked out onto the pool area. You can run your miles on the treadmill while checking out all the hunky men at the pool, need I say more?! 

My one complaint to Donald is the food that is served at the Trump. Whether it is the pool-side sandwiches and salads from their pool restaurant H2Eau or their dine-in room food. It is sub-par. The 6am pizza was probably only edible because I was starved and drunk. The meat on that pizza tasted like a blob of grease. Yuck! Next time I stay here I will get a burger at the Flamingo diner in the early morning hours before I retreat back to this otherwise impeccable hotel.

Note: There is no casino in this hotel, nor is smoking allowed anywhere on the property. So stay here if you want to avoid the chain-smoking, slot-machine addicted crowd and soak in some air of exclusivity!",3,2,2

I'm not sure what it is about this place, but it just doesn't seem to stack up to the other 5 star hotels in Vegas... I've stayed here a couple of times, because I had a dog with me and and it was dirt cheap. As you walk in, the decor and fixturing is actually really well done and this place give you a good feeling... Then you go to the front desk and they'll try to upsell you for days, which is a tad bit weird. The rooms were actually very well appointed and spacious but lacked the cleanliness of places like the Wynn, Cosmo or Mandarin. Almost seemed as if they missed several spots during the cleaning process. Another thing that stuck out to me was the amount of weed being smoked, lol, you could smell it in nearly all the hallways... Likely not the Trump's fault, but I would say that the clientele here is a bit different then you'd see at some of the other high end hotels... Also, this place is pretty far off the strip and has no casino but is literally across the street from the mall which is cool.

No-smoking and no casino were big plusses for me; you can still stay out partying until the wee hours of the night, only here you're pretty much guaranteed a quiet and comfortable night's (or day's) sleep. Here's the breakdown:

Room: 5 stars. We had a corner suite on the 40th floor with gorgeous views of the strip in two directions. The bathroom was bigger than my bedroom in Chicago with a huge shower, separate jacuzzi tub, and yes, even a TV embedded in the mirror. There was also a separate living room with a full 2nd bathroom and a kitchen that is absolutely nicer than mine at home. I would move in today if I could.

Service: 4.5 stars. Very friendly and accommodating staff. The desk staff was very accommodating about a late checkout, the bartenders were friendly and knowledgeable, and the free shuttle to the Wynn and Caesar's was a nice perk. Perhaps it can be blamed on how soundproof our room was, but we did have housekeeping enter once without our hearing a knock which shouldn't have happened. The friends we were staying with had the same thing happen so this comment is not in isolation.

Amenities\/Other: 4.0 stars. Did not use the pool or spa so can't comment, other than to say the pool area by looks alone would have been pretty cool. The bar and bartenders were great, if pricey (but hey, its a 5-star hotel in Vegas that isn't subsidized by an on-site casino).

Food (DJT Restaurant): 2 stars. The real downside was the on-site DJT restaurant. Did not eat dinner there but did go twice for breakfast (fool me twice, I know, lesson learned). No hostess there to greet or seat us either time, waited at least 10 minutes after being seated for a waiter, and had several issues receiving the wrong order.

I took my mom & sisters to Vegas over the weekend for my mom's birthday. We each got a suite ranging from the 49th floor to the 59th floor. Needless to say our views were nothing but breathtaking. The suites were gigantic in size - dare I say, bigger than my apartment\/condo! Each suite has a full kitchen, living room, an actual bedROOM, massive master bathroom, and another full bath outside. You read that right, two FULL baths! In the master bathroom - which could've double as a ball room; seriously, you can hold a dance in there as it's very spacious - there's a his and hers sink (are there any other kind of sinks?), a tub with a large window overlooking the strip, and a shower stand that could've fit a party of four (it is vegas after all)!

There are a few minor issues (albeit trivial) I had with the room, such as: bedroom door slamming continuously whenever the AC was on, old fashioned curtains that wouldn't close properly leaving the bright sunlight to shine through, and lastly, the dim lighting. The windows are darkly tinted and the light fixtures are opaque enough to drown out the lights, giving off a yellow hue. Ladies, it's difficult putting on your makeup when there's an instagram-style filter in the room. Thankfully these issues are so trivial that it's not enough for me to knock off a full point from this review. 

The price was reasonable despite a huge boxing fight going on that weekend so it should be very affordable off-season. If you don't mind the absence of a casino (or buffet) in your hotel then you'd be in for a luxurious treat at the Trump. Who knew the guy with a bad hairdo\/hairpiece has great style in design and decor?

At the end of our stay, my mom felt like a queen in her king size bed, and this princess was very pleased as well.",4,1,2

Based on the previous experience I've had here a while ago, I decided to stay at the posh Trump International Hotel again for another round of my vegas trip. Overall, I am satisfied with the familiar sight of luxurious decor and the soothing feel of the soft bed. The hot tub surely deserves a skyrocketing thumbs up from me since it has different speed functions and MAN was it relaxing to just soak and snore. If you have a chance, try to just kick back and chill out in that tub with the TV on within the mirror. Ahhh...can you say zen moment?

Aside from my general commendation, I do, however, have some criticism to make about one particular thing: the housekeeping service.

For some reason or another, they didn't come and clean my room after the first night that I was there regardless of the fact that I made sure to turn on the light that requests for a housekeeping service before going out and about. It took two calls to the front desk before a maid finally made her way up and rid the room of the used towels and touched up on the things that needed the necessary service. It wasn't that part that got to me however.

At around 4 AM, one of the peeps in my room started to snore. Being a light sleeper that I am and knowing that I'd have to rise up at the crack of dawn to get ready for a friend's wedding, I called the front desk to request for a pair of ear plugs. The lady on the line told me she'd forward the request on to the housekeeping department and that they'd bring a pair up right away. I patiently waited for about half an hour without the slightest hint that anyone was gonna bring me anything. I called the housekeeping again and was given the same message. Another 10 minutes passed by when the phone suddenly rang and woke everyone up. After picking up the phone, the person on the other line told me, in a tone similar to what you'd probably hear on the X-files episode ""I don't know who you talked to before, but there is no earplug"". 

Esqueeze moi? You have to actually call me to say that after two phonecalls instead of just telling me right away?

Pushing that aside, I acknowledged to her of the fact and tried to put my sleep through the old way of counting cows, sheeps, or whatever the hell other things are that jump over the imaginative fence. 

Five minutes later, someone rang the doorbell and disturbed everyone's peaceful slumber once again. To my surprise, the earplugs DO exist. 

I do admit that I am to blame for my friends' semi-lack of a good night rest, but I must share part of the guilt-pie with the housekeeping department since they should've informed the earplug detective that they DO have earplugs so that the unneccessary phone call and door bell would've been prevented.

Another thing that I wish would exist there is the concept of double-occupancy. Despite the availability of the convertible sofa-bed, who would want to sleep on that when coming to this hotel? But perhaps I missed the objective of this place. Maybe it's only intended for couples who want to stay there and cook things together instead of a group of people who are there for the vegas experience? Who knows? You be the judge. As for me, I'd give it a 4-solid stars for not have double beds and slow housekeeping service.",1,1,1

But I've only stayed in the room two nights out of five.  Wasn't at the hotel much otherwise.

Two issues:  
1.  The last guest (or a over zealous employee) thought it funny to set the alarm clock for zero dark thirty in the morning.

2.  Never attempt to use the complementary valet parking if there's two or more meetings\/conventions.  It's a three ring circus, a zoo, (take your pick) a madhouse!
Automobiles and taxicabs everywhere, valets nowhere.

At first I was disappointed, but since we like to try different hotels in Vegas, we saw this as a cool opportunity. Thank goodness we went in with a good attitude!

The area between the highway and the hotel is....interesting to say the least. Who knew Vegas had an erotic museum?? As previous reviews have stated, it's valet parking only. I don't mind that, but trying to get the car on Monday morning when we were leaving was a bit frustrating. We tried calling down when we were getting ready to leave to have the car pulled around so that it would be waiting for us, but when we called, we were told they couldn't bring it around until we were downstairs. Seriously?? The explanation given to my husband was that we had to physically hand the valet ticket in before they would go get the car. I thought it was a really lame excuse, but luckily it took only about 10 minutes for us to get our car.

Check-in was very quick and friendly. Yes, there is a $15 per day resort fee, but it pays for the parking, use of the pool, and use of the fitness center. The rooms are spacious, but not as impressive as those at the Palazzo. The bathroom is actually the best part about the room - very large shower and a nice jacuzzi tub. There is a TV in the mirror as well. I'll admit that on Sunday morning, I soaked in the tub and watched basketball - it was awesome. Our view completely sucked but that's what we get for using Priceline I bet (don't be jealous but we had views of the highway and the Stratosphere).

We don't mind walking, so the fact we were off the Strip didn't bother us. It's about a five minute walk to the Wynn and about 30 minutes to Bally's and Planet Hollywood which are in the center of the Strip. If you want to go to the Strip and have fun, but come back to a quiet hotel with no casino where you don't have to walk a huge distance to get to the room elevators, the Trump is not a bad place to stay.

We had a kitchen in each room, both fully stocked with cooking appliances and utensils.  This was great since there weren't any late night restaurants in the hotel.  We had the liberty to cook our own spam and rice. (gheeeettttttoooooo) hahah. The fridge was is a good size.  Big enough to fit a liter of Greygoose and my Jameson of course.

As soon as you walk in you are greeted by valet, and they're pretty quick I must say. The person who we checked in with at the front desk was very helpful as well. Check in time is at 3:00pm, but the rep was kind enough to get us into a room at 11:00am without me even bothering to ask if it was okay or anything, so I really appreciated that. He also directed us to the elevator and made it really helpful for us to get our way around the place. 

For valet you don't even have to wait out in the front for your car whenever you need to go out, you can just call valet from your room and give them your code and they will have your car ready for you asap! Did I mention it's included in the resort fee? I hate fees, but this one is well worth it! 

They also offer a shuttle that comes every 15 min and takes you too Ceaser's palace for free! Which is pretty cool, it's hard to get around this city especially on a holiday weekend it gets super packed and walking in the heat doesn't make it any better.

Now for the room it is super comfortable! and their rooms even have a kitchen and a spa tub which made everything a lot better. It's honestly one of the nicest rooms I've ever stayed and it's very spacious. 

I had trouble with my door not locking when I was leaving and I called security and they came right away and fixed the issue for me which was great.

They also offer a free shuttle to Caesar's Palace and Wynn because Trump is not on the Strip but it's actually like a 6 person van. Expect long waits or long walks, your choice.

When you enter the lobby you are greeted by a smoke free opulent setting that smells really good. Overall the staff is friendly. On the right of the lobby is the DJT Restaurant. We had breakfast there twice and it was fine. 

On the 6th floor is a pool with a bar and a restaurant with a limited menu. On two occasions it was hard to find a chair but after walking around in circles we found chairs. The pool is small but not a lot of kids and no rowdy groups. There was a DJ playing music loud so we had to talk really loud to each other. The service at the pool was good.

Our room was high up on floor 40 something. The room was huge with a sitting area and a tiny kitchen area. The bathroom is large as well.

I know service, good, bad, and indifferent. I've dealt with the full range of customers from happy to abusive and unreasonable for 12 years. Accidents happen, but how problems are resolved makes the difference between a positive and negative experience. 

The room was beautiful and well decorated. The TV in the bathroom mirror was a nice touch, ended up switching rooms and it didn't work in the second room but you couldn't see it from the tub anyway. The whirlpool tub was by far the best part of the room. It was huge. My boyfriend is 6'4"" and was able to stretch out in it. The towels and robes were soft and thick and didn't leave any lint after bathing. The view of the Wynn\/Encore and Fashion Mall was stunning especially at night. The Spa is amazing; spacious, luxurious treatment rooms, showers, and a wonderful lounge area with teas and water. On the down side, neither of our cell phones had use-able signal beyond the lobby (AT&T and T-mobile), the bathroom floor was sticky.

 The bell\/doormen were friendly, welcoming, and recognized me after the first day. The spa staff was professional and met my expectations. Where things went wrong began with housekeeping and ends with management.

We checked in and unpacked putting most of out items in drawers and left do some shopping before dinner reservations for our anniversary. When we returned to our room three hours after checking in, housekeeping (I'm assuming) threw out all our toiletries and the food I brought to cook (I didn't notice the food until we switched rooms, and by that point I felt like I was such an inconvenience to them I just let it go). After filling out security paperwork, management offered to refund the mandatory resort fee, a whopping $15. The desk manager did call our restaurant for us, at my request, and we were given a ride in the house car to the restaurant, unfortunately I felt like we were lucky to get that instead of having to take a taxi, or the nice leisurely stroll up the Strip as we had planned.

Security was professional and accommodating in trying to resolve the situation, but the desk manager made us feel like ""problem guests"" and that everything being done was above and beyond excellent customer care.

The GM did not sit down with us face to face, we had to argue over the phone about what had happened and what they could do for us. Eventually, the GM agreed to a room upgrade and a late check out. We were satisfied with that and just wanted to put it all behind us. 

The late check out we were begrudgingly promised didn't go smoothly either. We packed in the morning, left for lunch and some gambling,  we returned to checkout and were locked out of out room. After sorting that out I got the bill and the resort fees that were supposed to be refunded were still on the bill. All in all, it was just a big hassle.",3,0,0

It is almost as though they are trained so well to cater to customers that no offense would go unforgiven.

I love the room, especially the cooking area. Everything is thought of...the dishwares, pots, pans, utensils, table settings, etc.  I just imagined cooking (yea right i can't even do that) and thought if i decided to do it, it is doable with all the things provided.  The one thing though....i would not even cook since it is too close to the bed and i hate linen smelling like food.  I am not certain the exhaust is powerful enough.

The RR has tv on screen, unique, but i did not like the quality.  It is just a WOW, cool factor to add another star to this review. The bath though was so great with the spa like feel and powerful jets that will give temp cure to any aching muscles.

We had 12 girls in a Suite on the 23rd flr. We all slept comfortably all weekend. The sofa in the sitting area has a pull out bed in it too. The two bathrooms in the suite was a definite PLUS! You can only image how hectic it would have been having 12 girls get ready with one bathroom. The bathroom in the bedroom was ginormous! There was also a full kitchen. Only thing that was a downer was that the stove took forever to heat up! 

Staff was exceptionally friendly! Shout out to JULIUS! Two nights in a row, he was able to take the girls in the Shuttle to our destination. On our last day there, we wanted to walk the strip, and they offered to take us in their house car to wherever we wanted to go. Trump International definitely has exceptional customer service! Felt like we had VIP treatment from the staff all weekend!

For three nights we paid around $700-$800 total for the suite. It's a great deal! The hotel also isn't as hectic as the other ones, where there are a lot of people roaming around, going in and out. It was very relaxing! 

I definitely recommend staying at Trump International the next time you're in Vegas!",3,2,2

This hotel doesn't have a casino.  There's a barely traceable citrus scent that lingers throughout the hotel lobby.  I didn't appreciate this until I returned from walking through casinos with stench of cigars and cigarettes.  

Trump International Hotel is truly a first class hotel with attention to details.  Take for instance the hair-dryer...  It was high powered, light-weight, with a long extension cord.  There was a lighted make up mirror in the bathroom and a wash cloth in the shower.  The closets have lights that automatically turn on when you open them.  There are dual shower heads in the master shower, and there's a t.v. embedded in the bathroom mirror.

-friendly staff
-room service (food were good portion)
-TV in the bathroom 
-Shuttle to Wynn (every 15min)  and Caesars Palace (every hour)

The hotel has a nice lobby and efficient check in staff.  The room was very nice, spacious, clean with a big bathroom and a few kitchen facilities.  The ceiling to floor windows gave us a great view.  Unfortunately, we were looking onto Circus Circus parking lot and a couple of construction sites but I would think the strip view would be great.

The pool is nothing special and the hotel doesn't have that Las Vegas feel which was disappointing as we had overseas visitors with us on their first trip to Vegas.

The valet is extremely slow and somewhat indifferent.  

We booked 3 rooms and although the hotel is supposed to be non smoking, one of the rooms smelt so badly of smoke even after running the air conditioning full blast and leaving the door open for a while,  so we had to ask to change rooms.

We paid $89\/night for a comfortable bed (and I am picky with my beds), a kitchenette with pots, pans, a stove, fridge, and microwave over. A JACUZZI TUB! with a separate large shower and toilet. A TV embedded in the bathroom mirror, which in my opinion was a waste although it was cool.

Service:  The front desk allowed us to check in 30 minutes early, which was really nice after a 4 hour drive.  Also, the complimentary shuttle drivers are really nice and chatty.  They swing by every 15 minutes to take you to Caesar's Palace or Wynn Hotel.  

Room:  The room was spacious.  We had the standard king room, that has a sitting area, kitchen area, double closets, and a huge bathroom which I really enjoyed!  It has an in-mirror television, jet stream hot tub, and a private toilet and shower area separated by opaque glass doors.  The kitchenette has a mini fridge, electric stove with kettle, and complimentary keurig coffee pods\/machine.  

Cons:  What turned me off most was the noise level.  We stayed on the 40th floor and could still hear multiple trains passing by, as well as police sirens early in the morning.  

The water pressure in the shower sucks.  If you have long hair, wash it in the hot tub, or else it'll take an hour to rinse the soap out.  

Additionally, the pillows were uncomfortable.  It's feather filled, which isn't my favorite.  They squish down really fast, and give you neck problems the next day.

I had booked the hotel through Hotwire, and was initially disappointed that we did not get a hotel on the Strip, and that there was no casino.  Though not often willing to admit it, I was totally wrong!  The location was GREAT (5 minute walk to the strip), and the lack of casino was a blessing, given that I probably wouldn't have had enough money to get my car out of the airport parking lot had a casino been readily available. 

The real stars here were:

1. The service - the hotel car service was WONDERFUL for those 4 AM pick-ups, and they even took us to the airport.  Cabs will top out at 5 people per ride, but their service could accomdate all 7 of us in one ride.  Cesar, Vince and Tommy all took excellent care of us, and tolerated our banter - and singing - remarkably well.  

2. The room size - they are HUGE and have kitchenettes.   We opted for a one bedroom upgrade, plus a standard studio.  The one-bedroom has an extra bathroom (with a shower), which was clutch.

3. Check out time - 4:00 PM.  Need I say more?  I have never seen a standard check-out time this late.  Note - this is not a published time, but if you ask for it when you check in, it will be granted.

I also liked the big towels, bathrobes, comfy bed and the view. However I expected more of a Trump Hotel. There was no hair dryer in the room when we arrived. We did without until the next day and I left a note for the maid to be sure to leave one - she did not. When I called the operator to get one I was met with sarcasm so I had to complain about her. The shower door and door to the toilet are quite large and if you don't hold on to them and carefully shut them when you get out of that space they bang loudly. The flower arrangements in the lobby were quite weird - just a large vase of water with a bunch of flowers that looked like they came from Publix (still tied together) and plopped in the water. The flower bunches looked like they were trying to escape from the water as they were practically falling out. That was the way they designed it but I thought it looked tacky. But the worst part was the noise. We were on the 55th floor and still were awakened every morning by the train - some of which were 95 cars long - that's right I counted. I am surprised that Trump built this hotel in its location - right next to a train track. And if that weren't enough the constant stream of helicopters coming back from Grand Canyon tours every night was pretty annoying. We used the kitchette in fact, that is one reason we chose the hotel but there were no dishes - no coffee cups (that you can put in the microwave), nothing. So make sure you bring your own! The maid service was terrible too. My friend dropped a few nuts on the floor and there were crumbs from breakfast that were still there when we returned. The trash was not taken out and the makeup stain in the sink was still there. Upon leaving there was not one valet to help other than bringing the car around. We had to find someone to give us the keys and they quickly disappeared. No one helped put the luggage in the car. VERY disappointing!! Will I stay there again? Nope!",0,0,0

We had an awesome in the mirror TV as well as a beautiful view of the strip. Also room service was extremely quick and in the mornings when I ordered like breakfast at 8 o'clock it was at my door by 8 o'clock. Safety is a big factor for me and at the Trump I felt very safe and security was amazing. As well as the check and service was very pleasurable and the people working there truly want you to have a good experience. The Trump is definitely a very good quality hotel.

I arrived around 1 AM, there was only one check in agent and a long line of hotel guests waiting to check in.  After 30 minute wait time I finally got to talk to the check in agent.  Of course the long wait was not due to incompetence of the check in agent but because every guest was asked to join the trump card program which delayed the check in process.  

The room looked a little run down, the TV built into the bathroom mirror was a nice touch (not that I was going to use it).  Since I had an early start i needed to get my shirt pressed (they didn't offer that service).  There was no iron or ironing board in the room.  After 20 minutes I got my iron and it took them another 20 minutes to bring an ironing board.  After everything was done, I went to bed around 3:30 am. I didn't get any rest  because I had to be up at 6am. 

Some towels were dirty, there was no soap in the bathroom and the sink was clogged.  It looks like no one had dusted the room in some time.

First time here and thought the golden color made everything looked fancy. I liked it especially there was no casino in here so it won't take you in circles to find the elevator to your hotel room or had to be a second hand smoker. 

We stayed 1 night on the 37th fl and 2 nights on the 41st fl. The shower at the 41st was clearly stronger compared to 37th. However, the design of the shower was very difficult to get the right degrees of the water I needed. I had to go through both freezing and boiling hot water and slowly adjust to the right temperature. 

The shower and restroom both had a glass door but you can't really put both in use with your friends because it's see through! Lol Anyway, overall the room was very nice with our own little kitchen and all. 

Oh, and there was a big bathtub in the room which I believe it's for both bath and jacuzzi. How nice is that?

Ok, the above are pros, but what are the cons in my experience?

It's nice to get valet park since we can just drop ourselves right off at the front and jump right in for the heater. However, they took forever to get your car! On   a slow Saturday afternoon while I was starving for lunch, the car literally took 7-8 mins to get to us while on a busier day, it only took 3-5 mins. How does that even make sense? 

One exciting thing was the bathtub. Yup, I had a jacuzzi bubble bath! That was very fun and relaxing. And yes, the water temperature can be adjusted much easier compared to the shower. But we don't know if not many people uses the jacuzzi function or what, because after the water drains, we saw some dirty crap remains. (pls refer to my picture and see for yourself) This happened two nights straight. Good thing I always wash off with the stand up shower right after.

As far as now, the last on the list was the housekeeping. We put ""Do Not Disturb"" before we headed to bed because we don't know what time in the day the housekeeper will come knocking on our  door. Anyway, then after we were awake, I pressed for ""Housekeeping"" around 11:50am and I see house keepers on the other side of the hallway. One hour passed, two hours passed, nobody came and the housekeeping was still on the other side of the hallway at 2pm. We really needed some shower gel because we used it for the jacuzzi. Lol so we went to grab some ourselves and put it in the room just in case. We got back around 9pm and what do you know, NOBODY came to clean the room. Same messy room with the tips on bed. But we actually only needed some trash taken out and fix the bed, not totally messy. So we didn't bother calling the front and complained before we left instead since we were leaving the next morning. 

So we complained to the front along with the disgusting bathtub, the manager didn't sincerely apologize and said he'll inform Hilton to fix the trouble. But wait, this is Trump. How the heck does this had anything to do with Hilton?!! What the freak?!",3,1,1

The first problem I ran into was when I tried to look up my reservation on their website. It kept saying it was not found. I thought ok, it will just take a week or two to show up. After a good month I contact customer service wondering what the problem was. I was told there was no problem and that it was just too bad essentially that I could not find my reservation on their website. This took me by surprise. I have gotten better customer service at my local McDonalds.

The reason I was looking up the reservation was to possibly upgrade my room. After more thought and by the surprising ""customer service"" we decided to split and go for a different hotel. So to my surprise when I told a customer rep that I wished to cancel my bookings A MONTH, yes a month  in advance. They said Oh ok no problem. Shortly followed by you have been charged the full price of your stay. Thank you have a great day.

WOW! This place is shoddy people. Mr Trump needs to keep a closer eye on his properties and how they are reflecting his name. I do NOT expect this kind of horrible treatment from a hotel with the Trump name. Needless to say I will NEVER go to a trump Hotel EVER. And I would suggest you look elsewhere. Still shocked and appalled at the treatment of their customers. You all should be ashamed.",5,0,0

I'd read about the train\/noise issues at the rear of the building, so at check-in obviously I asked for a quiet room. I was told that a ""Strip"" view would be an upgrade charge. But on Floor 52 I won't hear a thing. I knew she was lying but whatever........OK so the noise is insanity. It's not a train just rumbling by in the night. This thing sounds like it's in your room, multiple times, all night long. Try it if u don't believe me.

Obviously I moved rooms the next day (without a charge) & they were relatively cool. I've been to Vegas 100 times & a (partial) Strip view should never cost u a penny, especially one that simply allows sleep to occur!

Little things made me rate Trump as 3* rather than 4: no TVs, headphones or bottled water in the gym. Housekeeping management is very poor (I'll spare u the details), no self parking option, no magnified shaving\/make up mirror in the bathroom, no electric curtains, Internet issues that they couldn't really fix, etc. etc.

The rooms are very nice, u may like that there's a kitchenette & the staff were all very pleasant. The pool area is very nice too, in a non-Vegas way. And the room rates are cheap.

Donald probably stays here when he's in town & it's totally fine. But now I know he wishes he didn't have to :-)",4,3,0

The floor was still with crumbs from my bf eatting chips the night before. But as we stepped out he had them take care of it. Oliver was so nice and took care of things quickly. Also helped us reserve a car rental for the next day.

Then when we went to take a nap. The sheets had blood. Gross! So when decided to go get a snack and let one of the female check-ins and tell her the shower kept leaking water all over bathroom floor. I mean huge puddles. She waved resort fee for day. But i still wasn't feeling happy about it.

We did order room service. 68 dollars for food that came cold. They forgot my toast and mayo. But other than it be cold the food was good.

Bhalsma checked us in. Hope I got his name right. For my birthday\/graduation celebration he gave us a great view and a high floor. Got us checked in quick. I even got a card wishing me well and congrats for my celebrations. He was so nice amd had great info in where to go.

The pool was relaxing! Not like the other party spots. The tables should be wiped down by chairs though. And the poole should be open later for adults.

The hotel is low key and great to come back from the loudness. It is gorgeous and the employees  are so nice. Luxury is the trump.

No military discount which is disappointing when m life has it.

I have only a few complaints, and as a guest who stays here often for both business and pleasure, they tend to be a reoccurring theme. 

As a hotel... It's beautiful. The rooms are nicely furnished, the lobby and the pool deck are well kept, and the employees are all very kind and professional. It is off strip meaning there is no casino and is positioned directly across from the Fashion Show mall making the access to shopping and restaurants quite convenient. However... If returning to the hotel at night it can be somewhat dangerous and multiple times I have felt unsafe even when returning with large groups of people. You have to walk down a back street behind buildings past garbage chutes or loading docks. There is always an ominous feeling or threat of someone following you or harassing you. I suggest always taking a cab, no matter how short the distance you must walk. 

In addition, the hot water in this hotel is never anything above ""warm"". The showers are always cold and short, and the water pressure is never even close to satisfactory. The bathrooms inside the rooms are separated only by a foggy glass partition making it somewhat awkward to take a shower or use the toilet if anyone else is in there with you. 

The breakfast always tastes like absolute garbage. They have a full menu as well as a breakfast buffet, but despite getting there early in the morning, everything always seems cold and hard as if it's been sitting under a heating lamp or in a dish for too long. I've had the buffet before and it is compared to most standard hotel chains, however today I ordered an omelette as well as several other things with my family and was severely disappointed. Not only were the breakfast potatoes hard and burnt, but the omelette was runny and none of the ingredients inside were cooked and the cheese hadn't even slightly melted. It was as if they pulled it all straight out of a bag and wrapped it up. The toast was hard, the French toast and waffles undercooked, and the coffee tasted like something from a convenience store.

If you are looking for beauty and want to be away from a smoke filled, high traffic casino, this hotel is definitely worth the stay. However I recommend finding food elsewhere and preparing for an uncomfortable dressing and showering experience in advance.",1,0,0

We checked out of Vdara after our third day there because of the major lack of service, nickel and diming, and filthy room with poor room service and came to Trump. Best decision ever. 

The one bedroom suite here is much nicer and much bigger (second bathroom even has another shower). The kitchen is high-end (could make thanksgiving dinner if I wanted to). The service is friendly, responsive and warm. (e.g., They brought up a crib 15 min after we checked in. Took 3 hours and two phone calls for a pack-n-play at Vdara). The pool is heated, plenty of lounging chairs and two hot tubs. And let's not forget, location, location, location. It's right across the street from fashion show mall, Wynn and  Venetian. Property is spotless, well maintained and inviting.  The value of staying here is so far outweighed by what we were getting at Vdara, feels like we left a camping site for civilization. 
 
The one downside is that it's a bit noisy. Insulation not the greatest. We are on 20th floor and can hear thumping music and trains!

*Smoke free hotel
*Casino free hotel (No casino)
*Large rooms
*Quiet hallway
*Very clean room and lobby
*Coffee in the room
*Allowed us to check in at 1130am, before designated check in.
*Short line for check in
*Simple yet elegant lobby
*The Trump accepted my Priceline ""name your price"" offer
*Print boarding passes for free in business center
*Off the strip and across the street from the Fashion Mall where there are multiple eateries
*Shuttle van to Cesars Palace and other stops.

Donald, here's how to make it great!:

**Offer self park option
*Stop trying to up sell me at check in
*Improve TV reception which buffered multiple times during our stay
*This is a 5 star hotel, be more robust with the bathroom amenities such as those offered at the Wynn (qtips, hair scrunchie, makeup remover pads, bath wash in shower and bathtub)
*This is a 5 star hotel, offer ceramic coffee cups not just paper ones in the room

Nice hotel in general with all the standard amenities: Cafe downstairs, cab service, gift shops, gym, spa and pool, plus free shuttles to the Wynn and other locations nearby! Room service was prompt, valets could have used a little more work, but the front desk was very nice.

Clean and hospitable place, big plus for having Sub Zero fridges! Our view was directly over the strip so it was a highlight at night!

The price was not too bad once you consider a single room is enough to fit 4 people. The gym was decent, mostly cardio\/elliptical  stuff (bring you iPod b\/c they have direct link-ups for them), weighted machines, light free weights (nothing heavy than 50 lbs). Plus for having ice chilled towels and ice water on tap w\/ lime or lemons. Two hot tubs and plenty of basking area, only bad side was the weather didn't permit much during the visit.

One major thing was a downside is that reception for anyone with AT&T is outta luck when in the hotel.

While considered ""on the strip"" it is actually about 2 blocks back from Las Vegas Blvd right across a small side street from fashion show mall (if you stay here eat at stripburger for sure). It is about a 5 minute walk from the Wynn. 

The rooms are designed like condos- single open room and bathroom. The room is large, has a king bed, and a small kitchen area with a fridge and stove. The bathroom is very nice with a huge shower, tub, and there is a TV built into the mirror. The bed\/beddings were very nice , as was the furniture in the small sitting area. The Tv is about 40 inches so nothing spectacular. Theinside of the hotel- the hallways, the entrance etc. are all very nice and since it is a smaller property there wasn't a long wait to check in, millions of people standing around in the lobby etc. I had a drink at the bar downstairs and it was good but not great. 

The fitness area was very nice- there was free bottled water and headphones. All the equipment was in working order and seemed like it had been kept clean.",4,3,3

We arrived just after the 3PM check-in time one recent Sunday afternoon and were greeted at the front by a kind valet who arranged for a bellhop. We stepped inside the beautiful lobby and were happy to receive a complimentary upgrade to a strip-view suite on the 35th floor (3500). 

Upon entering our room, we found ourselves in the finest hotel room either of us had ever stayed at. Even the basic rooms at the Trump International are loaded with amenities, such as a kitchenette with cook surface, refrigerator, and microwave, as well as a humongous Jacuzzi spa that could fit 3 to 5 average sized adults and at least 2 very fat people, or one massively obese man and two slender women.

Overall, we had a wonderful experience and I can't wait to stay here again.",3,5,2

Trump Hotel:
-Away from the strip, believe me it's a long walk to the general area
-Resort fee ($25\/night) for all the necessary inclusions like wifi, free shuttle to Wynn and Caesars, shoe shine (only for BLACK shoes! no cognac or brown),
-No casino here
-Restaurant below is disappointing
-Stuck us in the handicap room... who does that?!
-No housekeeping for 2 nights?! C'mon, get your act together

For the most part, it didn't disappoint! You don't realize how pervasive cigarette smoke is here until you get to spend time in a smoke-free hotel. The whole place smells wonderful! 
Check-in was a breeze. The agent was hell-bent on finding us a better room than the one we originally had. We went from a mountain-view room to a strip-view, considerably higher up in the building. Since Trump offers free late check out (4 pm!), there may be a small wait until your room is ready. 
After rocketing up to the 47th floor (holy moly, those elevators are speedy!), we headed to the room. A tip: there will be one set of double doors with two room numbers on it. They lead to a foyer, with separate doors for each room. We were thrown for a minute, not wanting to walk into someone else's room, but no worries. 
The room (a one bed studio) was very nice. Comparable to Caesars or the Venetian. As with a lot of these places, you find chips and scratches in most of the furniture (I ended up with a splinter because of that, so watch it!). Maybe I have a weird obsession, but the bathroom was definitely the best part! Gorgeous and very well-appointed. The tub...oh goodness. Enough room for you and 3 of your friends, with jets! FYI, it takes forever to fill. There is a separate, glass enclosed shower, which will also accommodate the friends ;) The TV in the mirror is a nice touch!
Each room has a kitchenette, complete with pots, pans, utensils, a blender, glasses, etc. 
Two downsides during our stay: First, they provide down pillows, which, as far as I'm concerned, come straight from Satan. Miserable. Second, there is no self-park, which is fine. In its place, the hotel provides valet, again fine. Except the whole situation is so poorly organized. There's no order, so cars are sitting around willy nilly. Because of this, it takes quite a while for your car to get to you. It would make much more sense to have designated lanes for taxis, incoming cars, outgoing cars and a through lane. Instead, there are no lanes, so it can be a mess. A 20 minute wait for your car is not abnormal.",1,1,0

It was really quite nice and different, no loud groups coming in and out and non-smoking. I thought we'd have the city view suite, but I think we were facing the other side and man, that train passing through. Definitely a downside to this location. Bathroom is HUGE, and score for having a TV and a combination washer\/dryer as well. Added plus to not charging for bottled water which they restocked every day. 

We decided to eat in their restaurant on the last day before we left. Server said it would be 15 minutes to seat us, because they were full. When we got seated, it was weird, there was only one other group there. Hmm...food took forever to come out, and it's not like we ordered anything fancy, club sandwiches and salads. An extra tip, if you guys will be using carts to take away the dirty dishes, please invest in some carts that don't squeak. The clanking of the dishes combined with the squeaky wheels make for such loud and unnecessary noise. 

It is a little far from the main strip, so cab rides are a bit more expensive. Oh and another very important thing, horrible cell phone service. I could barely get one bar of service.",0,0,0

I pricelined it for $100 a night (you can find it for $89 a night now though).  It is located one block off the strip.  The walk isn't bad at all because the street is well-lit and it isn't ghetto or anything.  
The lobby is beautiful.  Check in was speedy, however, beware of the $15 resort fee each night they tack on...for what? Not sure.  we forgot all about it though when we got to the room... wow.. absolutely gorgeous!  
The room is BIG with one entire wall of built in cabinets, drawers, shelves and kitchen stuff.  There was also a nice plasma TV.  Something I appreciated is that there was ZERO noise from neighboring rooms and the hallway.  Thats one thing i really HATE about some hotels and fortunately, this room was super quiet and private.  THANK YOU TRUMPY!
The bathroom is HUGE with a big shower, plenty of space for two.. with a big jacuzzi tub and a built in TV in the vanity mirror!  Spotless space with plenty of towels.  They only give you two soap bars, shampoo, conditioner, lotion and a shower cap.  Nothing special.  
The bed was big and soft and super comfy.  The kitchenette was well equipped with everything you'd need, except napkins!  Anyhoo, the kitchen comes with pots, pans, silverware, plates, cups, mugs, wine glasses, salad spinner, pot holders, spatulas, place mats.. all sorts of stuff.  One thing I noticed is that they forgot to take the used coffee filter thingy out of the coffee machine.  Minor mistake, no biggie.  They wash your dishes for you everyday.  YEAH!  LOVE IT!  Also, they give you a few bottles of water every day which I appreciated.  We were on kind-of-a budget so we took cereal from home and just bought milk from the walgreens down the road.  It helped to save a few bucks for breakie.  We also brought our leftovers from the restaurants we went to so the fridge and microwave came in handy.  Hey, times are tough! Gotta do, whatcha gotta do, right?
We had a city view (39th floor).  We heard the train passing by the first night but only because we were still awake around 2am.  It wasn't that bad though.  If you are a SUPER light sleeper, then just take ear plugs.  Geez.  
Possibly my favorite part has to be the robes!  Yes, robes.  They were soft and comfy and just oh so nice!  They sell them for $125 at the spa but I found them online somewhere for $75 each.  
We enjoyed the pool one of the days and it was nice.  I enjoyed the nice pool chairs and the music.  
I noticed people waiting a bit for their cars at the valet.  But they seemed to only wait 5-10 minutes.  We just walked and took the DEUCE bus everywhere.  It wasn't bad at all but we really like walking so it depends I guess.  
Also, something really nice was that they day we checked out, we went downstairs to leave our suitcases with the front desk because our plane didn't leave until 7pm and the front desk guy offered to extend our checkout until 4PM!  At this point it was 11am and we had other things planned but we thought it was a nice gesture!  Next time we'll take them up on it.    
I appreciated that it is a non-smoking hotel.  And we don't gamble, so the lack of a casino actually made our stay more enjoyable.  

I HIGHLY recommend this place to all.",1,0,1

Mentioned to the doorman and he said he'd let someone know.  Had to wait earlier in the day for 30+ minutes for the shuttle as well.  Overall, the shuttle was a waste of time for us.

The hotel is off the strip, just across the street from Fashion Mall and down the road from the Wynn Resort. It was amazing. We were greeted as soon as we got out of our car and a bell hop was right there getting our luggage and whisking us inside to check-in. Check-in was fast, courteous, and easy. Our room was on the 54th floor facing the strip. The view was AMAZING! The room was clean, quiet and enjoyable. It was a welcome calm place to come back to after the hectic strip scene. The best part was the New Years fireworks show. Nearing midnight, we went back to our room and watched the fireworks show over the strip from 5 hotel roof tops. Our view was amazing! We saw all of the fireworks (except for the Stratosphere which was behind the Trump) and had an uninterrupted view of the entire show. It is a fireworks show I'll always remember. Here is where the Trump really went above and beyond. After getting home, we realized we left our camera in the room with ALL of our pictures and video of the firework show. The Trump staff found our camera and shipped it back to us. We received it and it was in working order and all of our memories that we captured in film were saved! Thanks so much to the Trump staff for finding our camera, placing it in lost and found, then mailing it us when we called for it and supplied identifying information.

Ethel at the front desk was wonderful. It was around 10 in the morning when my boyfriend and i arrived. I was there for a lighting conference and my boyfriend had just flown in from Rome the night before and we were both really tired. In fact we had about 2 1\/2 hours of sleep. I was hoping there were rooms available by the time we got there, but none were. Ethel however was able to convince me to upgrade our room. I normally wouldn't have agreed because of all the expenses i knew we would have next few days, but she was very nice and friendly and even have me tips on a few things here and there, like the rewards program and such that i agreed. I don't regret spending the extra money to upgrade. Our one bedroom suite was amazing (I've stayed in one before but never really got to enjoy it since my friends and i went clubbing a lot), but this time my boyfriend and i took advantage of the room and the amenities the hotel offered.

The valet people were very nice and welcoming, they always remembered who i was. Houskeeping, Lilliana, was great. I think she could tell that my boyfriend and i had a bit of OCD, so when we came back after an afternoon out by the pool, we saw all our toiletries lined up like perfect little soldiers.

In fact, the Trump is probably the ""farthest"" we will stay off the Strip since it's only less than a 10-min walk to the Strip.

The building was originally built as a residence but was converted to a hotel. We originally reserved a studio but thanks to my husband who decided to add in an extra treat for my birthday, he decided to upgrade our reservation to a 1-bedroom suite. There was a kitchen (fitted with a fridge, oven, microwave, electric stove, kettle, toaster, silverware, plates), and a large enough living room with an L-section couch and a 4-seater dining table. The master bedroom has an attached bathroom that is huge enough to fit 2 sinks, a dressing table, a jacuzzi, a shower stall, and a separate area for the toilet bowl. There was a second bathroom in the living room area. It's definitely big enough if our family joined us. The room amenities made our stay very convenient and we were able to eat something quick in the morning our suite before heading to the pool.

The decor is alright. I'm not sure if ""dated"" is the right word but it was of the classic type and definitely not contemporary like the Encore at the Wynn where we've stayed during our last two trips. The hallways at the Trump is beige and maybe a little dull... again, not sure if ""dated"" is the right word because the hotel clearly isn't old, but it's just a little too mundane.

This hotel is not really a resort-type of hotel so the pool area is just your rectangular shaped pool and guests surround the pool to tan. Again, if I were to compare the Trump with the Wynn and the Encore, the pool over there is almost like a sprawling area in itself. As for the pool area at the Trump, what you see in front of you is all there is to it. Pretty small area but it does its job if you're just there to lay by the pool but be sure to get there early as the chairs get taken up before lunch time.

There's no casino at the Trump and it's also non-smoking. Literally right across the street is Nordstrom which is part of the Fashion Show Mall. So you can either get to the Strip by walking through Fashion Show Mall if you want to escape the heat, or you can just walk outside along the sidewalk from the Trump to the Strip. For an off-the-strip hotel, the location is very convenient and easily accessible. 

Overall, it's a very good choice of hotel but again, it lacks the hip and modern factor that Vegas is all about. Not a big deal but my heart still has a special place at the Encore at the Wynn :)",2,0,0

We arrived at close to noon and the drive way was a little hectic. It seems they have no order to it. The workers try to maintain a flow but with the cabs, shuttle, valet, people checking out etc. It was crazy that one day. The rest of my stay the driveway was fine. As soon as we pull up. We were welcomed and asked if we needed anything. Our room wasn't ready yet. They checked us in and called us around 2 when it was. ""No early check in fee"". One more slight negative was that I paid extra for a strip view on the 42nd floor. We could see the top of all the hotels but that pesky treasure island blocked the strip mostly. 

Now to the good stuff. This is most definitely a different type of Vegas hotel. If you're looking for the chaos of a casino, clubs, restaurants and other elements of the strip around you at all times then this is not the place for you. I thoroughly enjoyed escaping back to our room after the commotion of the strip. With no casino full of smoke and games. We were out of valet to our rooms in about a minute with the express elevators. the room was very modern and comfortable. Sub zero fridge that froze everything because I mistakenly turned it up. A double stove with microwave oven over. We used all of that. The view through the floor-to-ceiling windows was breathtaking day and night. The bed was so comfortable I didn't want to lay in it until I was ready for fear that it would put me to sleep. the huge his and hers closets held all of pur belongings with space above for our suitcases. Ample cabinet and drawer space. We requested plates and utensils. They give you water and Starbucks coffee daily. No power black out curtains. The bathroom is where they went all in. The huge ""quietly"" jetted tub. The shower big enough for 4 people. The his and hers sinks with a huge mirror with built in tv was innovative to me. The enclosed toilet gave privacy. The pool was all that was needed. Padded beach chairs, day beds and a couple cabanas for rent. It was never crowded and the wait staff was there but never overbearing. This hotel was perfect for me. Glamorous but not over the top. Right accross the street for a Nordstroms. Close to industrial ave so we could get around quickly without getting stuck in the strip traffic. The rooms have a door bell and buttons to call for house keeping and ""do not disturb"". All of the wait staff went the extra step to take care of us.

The place is tacky, even for Vegas.  I'm borrowing the words ""faux opulence"" from another reviewer.  That sums it up to a tee.  The whole place feels like they want to be Downton Abbey, but come off more like Beverly Hillbillies.  And the shop is so tacky, selling left over Trump campaign chotzkys.

Located quite a hike from the strip.  They offer a free shuttle, but regardless of the time of day it was always a 30+ minute wait.  Geez...get another shuttle bus.  So went to the bar because it was cold while my husband was waiting in line,  just to try to get a coffee to go.  No go.  Seriously, no coffee to go.  

So many great options in Vegas.  Give this one a miss.",0,1,0

The awful $29\/night resort fee is a complete rip off, the shuttle service isn't very good and the 5mps internet is a joke, you also can't use the Business Center unless you pay extra which is stupid as hell.

The rooms are absolutely awesome except the TV, I have to say the main one (yes there is more than 1) is maybe 29 in and similar to a tube tv (awful choice).  The TV in the bathroom mirror is so damn cool and that bathroom is HUGE, BIGLY :)  Anyhow, we did like it but will pass next time, we will mozy on down and stay at the Wynn.",1,0,0

Even though it's a bit removed from the strip (just a bit) it wasn't so far that we had to cab it anywhere. And honestly, it was nice to be a little removed from all the noise and people (hi, I'm 80). Also happy there was no casino and no smoking. Props Mr. Trump!

The entrance was pretty, check in was seamless, and the room was NICE. I wasn't expecting a whole little kitchen area, but there it was - full of fancy, tiny appliances (Sub Zero, Wolf, William Sonoma...). And get this - there was a TV IN THE BATHROOM MIRROR. Come on, that's pretty swank. 

We were only there for one night, so I didn't get to fully enjoy the jetted tub, or the kitchenette, or the pool.  I would definitely stay there again though (but only at a discount). Nice decor. Nice staff. Good location. The Apprentice.",0,1,0

Walking into this hotel, the smell is beyond good. Can't explain it but so nice to be in a nonsmoking hotel. The fresh smell was even in our room.

Checkin was a breeze even at almost midnight. The checkin person even gave our 3 year old a Trump kids pack that had sunglasses and coloring book with crayons. She loved it and it saved us throughout our trip. 

Our room was fabulous. Huge bathroom with a gigantic jacuzzi tub. Huge separate shower. Also a TV in mirror of bathroom. We had a great view of the pool and looking south of strip. Bed was comfortable. 

Since the Trump Hotel is not right on the strip have a shuttle to drop off at Wynn or Caesars. Very easy to do. Though we ended up walking through mall and more specifically Nordstrom's to get back to hotel. 

Never went to pool as way too hot. 

Enjoyed the refrigerator and microwave that were in room. Lots of storage.

It's a short walk from the strip, and across the street is one of the main shopping malls, which you can walk thru to get to the strip if its raining or just too-d*mn-hot out.  If you don't want to walk, you can get the free shuttle to Caesar's (down strip) or the Wynn (just across the street).

The rooms are VERY spacious, with a large jacuzzi tub in the bathroom, as well as a tv in the mirror and a glass-enclosed shower.  Views toward the Mirage look down to the pool, which is resort style and really great.  There are bright lights, though, that shine from the pool upward at night right into the rooms - not that it's bright that you can't sleep or anything but more that you can't enjoy the view AS much with the bright lights.

If you have some time while here, make sure you spend time at the pool - with a bar on the pool deck, you have no reason not to get some sun. 

Note: There IS A RESORT FEE ( I think every hotel in Vegas has one now ) each night per room.  It ""includes"" wifi, pool use, and other resort features, but keep this in mind when booking on other sites like Expedia and Priceline as this fee is not usually included in those rates.

1.) The entrance is literally directly across from Nordstrom at the Fashion Show mall. I spent more time shopping than at the gaming tables, somehow that feels wrong for a Vegas vacation.

2.) The doors to the rooms consist of a double entry system: The 1st door opens into a small foyer connecting to 2 individual suites. Keeps the noise out and my precious Panda from barking at every elevator ding and random passerbyer.

3.) Pet friendly! Although the rate is a bit steep ($200 per stay, max 2 dogs \/ 50lbs each) but since Panda is such a sweet tempered and tiny little thing, we negotiated the rate down to $100. Pet amenities included, such as doggie bowls, treats and bed.

4.) 4pm checkout affords an after-lunch nap while avoiding the LA-bound traffic jam at noon. 

5.) The lobby is delightfully fragranced with some sort of heavenly scent, I'm guessing a jasmine \/ lychee blend. If only my house smelled like this.


6.) Non-gaming and most importantly...Smoke free! Now my coats can go back in my closet rather than straight to the drycleaner.

7.) The view from our room was fantastic. The elevator was lightning fast, and I kept getting small bouts of motion sickness after each ride but I suppose that's a small price to pay for having such a fabulous view of the city lights.

I didn't use the spa or gym but it looked really nice inside. Overall, I was really impressed with everything and if we ever come back to Vegas we will definitely stay here again.",0,0,0

My boyfriend, my BFF and I decided on a Friday to take a last minute trip to Vegas, and we found a room at the Trump for $239 on a Saturday night.  We ended up choosing the Trump because of its 4:00pm checkout time.  When my friend and I checked in at the front desk, we received a free upgrade to a one bedroom suite!

The suite rivaled the size of our 2-bedroom house in LA.  It was a corner room on the 40-something floor.  The best part was the jacuzzi with a gold plated mirrored window overlooking the entire strip.  And when you're done painting the town, their beds are AMAZING.  My BFF and I crashed on the bed and I could not feel her move from my side of the bed.  Soooo cushy!

The Trump is great because its close to all the action, but not having a casino downstairs is nice when you get back to the room and just want to relax.  No crazy noises, you can unwind, soak in the jacuzzi and feel like royalty.

Believe me, people who complain about the location has got to be a bit lazy, as the hotel was located right across from the Fashion Show Mall by Venetian. The Trump Hotel is smoke-free, and thereby smells amazing as you walk in the door. The fresh scent of flowers carry through the whole lobby which was pretty nice to say the least. Staying at a smoke free hotel is something that I have come to require when staying in Vegas, as it's unbearably smoky everywhere. 

The staff was extremely friendly, and I couldn't have been happier with the maid service, who ensured that we had all the coffee and cups that we needed every day. Kudos to the Pool staff members for their helpfulness and good attitude despite the sweltering heat, and the pool bartenders who really knew how to make a killer whiskey sour. 

Overall we were very happy with most everything about the hotel. One weird thing that happened, though, was that we were looking to drive to a restaurant off of the strip one morning, and my car had been brought out by the valet BEFORE I told them that I was going to need my car. There must have been some kind of misunderstanding between another guest and they may have mistook the room number, but it felt just a bit uncomfortable.

The Valet incident, TV in the bath not working, and the tub being slightly dirty, forces me to rate this hotel a 4* out of the possible 5*. However, I will definitely be back and stay, as I am a very happy customer. 

Thank you for a great week!",3,1,1

Kitchenette with a stove (need to call room service to deliver kitchen utensils and pots\/pans) and an ultra luxurious robe and slippers to use doing your stay. The robe was extremely heavy and soft that I just *had* to buy one at the spa. A real investment at about $150, it is totally worth it.

I have to say this is hands down the worst one on the strip. It is an obvious eye sore from route 15. It doesn't blend in well with the much larger and grander themed hotel and casinos on the strip. The outside is solid tacky gold. 

The inside left me wanting more. They are clearly trying to make the place look grand! I would maybe take a recommendation from the other surrounding casinos. Their architecture, and designs are breath taking. While the Trump tower leaves you wafting the air, like a bad fart. I am very glad I was staying at a much nicer resort than this place. I would recommend taking down trump tower and replacing it with a casino that fits more in with the Las Vegas atmosphere.",11,5,2

Upon arrival, the employees were beyond friendly and eager to inform us of all that Las Vegas had to offer. They also made good on their part to make us feel entirely at home. The building was immaculately designed, there are express elevators to get you up to your 40-60 floor suite in literally 30 seconds. Everything as that's promised, is everything that you get.

The room service and amenities were fantastic. The suite was spotless, everything placed perfectly in it's correct place and order (I made sure I looked for imperfections). The suite included kitchen, dining area, 3 piece bathroom, living room with a BREATHTAKING floor-to-ceiling\/wall-to-wall view. the bedroom was large with an identical BREATHTAKING floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall view. A huge en suite bathroom that I thought could only exist in my dreams. The hotel is located right off of The Strip but directly across the street from Nordstrom in Fashion Show Mall.

For a five-star hotel you would expect to have all the amenities in the hotel room, however, that is simply not the case. The hotel requires you to call in a request for all amenities such as utensils, cups, toiletries and they didn't even have a pen in the room.  I understand that they probably do this because they want you to tip the staff every time they deliver an amenity, but when you're booking a five-star hotel you would expect everything to be provided for you. Also I didn't like the elevator arrangements because if you booked two different rooms and one room happens to be on a different level than the other, there's a huge likelihood that you won't be able to take the same elevator to the other room, but instead you would actually have to go all the way to the lobby or to the ice room or to the pool in order to switch elevators. I booked a room on the 49th floor but my friend stayed on the 56 floor, when I asked a staff member which elevator was the most convenient way to get to my friend's room, the staff member had no idea. 
Also there's only one restaurant (not open 24 hours) so if you wanted to order food you have to order from room service ($27 for a regular burger--the Trump burger...which wasn't even cooked right). 
That being said I probably wouldn't stay here again because it is really inconvenient and if I wanted an epic bathtub I would probably go try out Cesar's palace next time.",1,1,1

The rooms are beautiful and we got a free upgade to a room with view. The first thing I noticed was that one of the light swiches in the room was broken but I thought maybe they just haven't seen it to fix it. The next thing we noticed was that the toilet didn't flush right and when we went to the pool the spa was cold and there was no sign that it was out of order. Fortunately there was a second spa that worked. i was really dissapointed that the Pool closed at already 6pm and the last shuttle from cesars Palace back to the Hotel goes at 12am. For paying so much and being a 5 Star Hotel i was very dissapointed in the things it offered at that time. I'd say skip this one and spend that kind of money on a Hotel on the strip.,0,0,0

No casino in the building was a plus because they have a shuttle every 10 min. Going to several other nearby hotel casinos...this made it less crowded and no smoke inside!

Tip: if you like to enjoy a nice pool, this may not be the best choice...the pool is too  small and over-crowded on a warm day!  The hotel gym rates a 5 on a 1-10 scale...

On the second day, we called for some towels, so we waited and waited.....and WAITED... and the towels NEVER showed up! My friend got so fed up with them, he went downstairs to the lobby to get some towels and toliet paper himself, and they told him that the housekeepers would bring it up to the room. about an hour later, the towels came and when we asked about the toliet paper, they said they RAN OUT! ok, seriously...how can a hotel run out of toliet paper? 

You also have to pay $15 dollars\/a day for valet parking if you are staying at the hotel. When I was leaving, I called the valet desk for them to bring my car up front, and they told me they do not offer that service!

Its pretty bad sometimes. For breakfast I saw only 2 options to have my eggs in an omelette form. EIther a skillet or Omelette. I don't really like either and asked for a Scramble. The woman and I danced around the semtantics of what a scramble really is and then told me that I would have to get a skillet option and then stir everything up on my plate. wonderful. it was like i was having a Larry David moment. She only filled my water glass half full while filling my husbands to the brim, then she took my saucer while i had a cup of hot cocoa in my hand, forgot to bring bread. Either she was drunk at 8 am or she hated me. not sure which. 

Anyway, i ended up getting the skillet because apparently they can't just scramble eggs. onions on the bottom of a greasy skillet, with a hashbrown, then eggs and tomatoes. It was a hot mess, and not in a good way. Greasy and gross. 

Then i ordered room service. The chicken soup was bland and would have been better out of a can. The chicken strips were pretty good tho. and the BLTA i had today was good.",0,0,0

The hotel is beautiful with a very nice lobby. Check-in is very easy and everybody that works here is very nice. It is right next to the fashion show mall which is a huge plus and has easy access to the strip. I got a room on the 56 floor, just a standard room with a king bed, and it had a view of the strip. Cleanliness is taken seriously here.

The bad:

The bed, which is the most important thing to me, was as hard as a rock. The mattress was very uncomfortable and I had to sleep on the comforter and use one of the robes to cover myself just to be able to lay on the bed. I woke up several times during the night because of how hard the mattress was. It is, hands down, the most uncomfortable bed that I have ever slept in at a four or five star hotel. If you like hard mattresses, and I mean hard like a rock, you will like this! For most of us that want to sleep in a comfortable bed and feel like we are being carried on pillows, which is what top hotels are all about, one will be sorely disappointed.
As an FYI, I also had a chance to try late-night room service. It took about 30 rings before somebody picked up to take the order. All I ordered was a chicken noodle soup and a Caesar salad. The chicken noodle soup was OK but it was nothing to write home about. The Caesar salad was extremely disappointing and felt generic. Overall it was not bad, yet not at all indicative of a four star or higher hotel in the way that it was presented.
Overall, it is a nice hotel so it should have received a total of five stars in evaluation. My information on room service is just for FYI because I really don't care and don't think that a hotel should get points off for that. My points off come due to how uncomfortable the mattress was and this is the type of mattress that I have seen in two and sometimes three star hotels. Most four and five star hotels pride themselves on the most comfortable mattress. 
I do not plan on staying here again because I think that a comfortable bed is the absolute cornerstone of what a great hotel should be about.",1,0,0

So I got offered a good deal to stay 3 nights with Hilton Grand Vacations @ Trump that I couldn't pass up. I was offered an upgrade to a corner bedroom w\/separate living room that I accepted. Looking at the advertised rates for the room, it's not a bad deal.

The room was fully equipped and I couldn't ask for anything more. The room felt open and having a view of the strip was great to wake up to in the morning. The master bathroom was huge and the jacuzzi was great to relax in. We had four people in our room and they had their own full bathroom and a good sofa + sofa bed that you could easily sleep 3 on.

Taxi & ridesharing was very fast and significantly faster than anything on the strip. The surrounding area is a bit dead, so maybe that's where they stage? Apparently, they offer a shuttle across to Encore and down to Caesars, but time is money so walking or hailing a car was the best option for a busy weekend. Another thing I liked was the speed of the elevators. We rarely waited longer than 10 seconds and the ride up is stupid fast.

Can't speak much of the amenities here, but we stopped by the pool and gym just to see it. The gym looked pretty equipped and more than your average hotel. The pool area was nice, but plain and not really a party spot. Also, no casino here so your closest options are Wynn, Palazzo or Treasure Island.

Now for those who don't like to walk, this hotel might not be for you. Despite being across Encore, it does still take a solid 5 minutes to walk from the hotel to get on Las Vegas Blvd. From then on, it just varies on where you're going but IMO, walking to Caesars or any of the middle strip properties will probably be a mission for most people (especially girls in heels)
If you love to walk like I do, then this is your spot! I rarely explore the end of the strip (Mirage and on) cause I normally like to stay much closer, but it was cool to be in a different part.",2,0,0

Only downside were the jets in our hot tub were broken and when we reported it to the owner it didn't get fixed. The pool, spa and bar were all very nice and fit our needs. The hotel is close to restaurants and shopping which was also a plus. Overall my stay at trump tower was a good experience. The only reason I gave 3 stars was the fact that they held $100 a day for deposit and when I checked out the man at the front desk said it would be released immediately. Well it's Monday and no $200 yet, and when I called to inquire they told me those funds will not released for 3-5 days. So now I'm left with $60 in my account until Wednesday or Friday at the latest. This is the deal breaker for me booking here again.",0,0,0

Went here two years ago and was impressed with how spacious a standard-sized room is. It was just my husband and me but the room can easily accomodate 4 as it has a fold-out sofabed.  Rooms are tastefully and simply decorated. The off thing about the room was that the bathroom wasn't cleaned well enough as the floor around the toilet was a bit sticky and smelly - housekeeping issues there. I was ecstatic to have a stovetop but it didn't work when I tested it out.

The happy hour in the lounge \/ dining area near the lobby has good deals on drinks and tasty apps. Recommended if you don't mind a bit of a stroll or wait for their free shuttle to the strip. It was really hot when I went so the walk to the strip felt very long and was inconvenient in the heat. It's a bit of a hassle to catch the shuttle too and they stop after a certain time. I'm going back to Vegas in two weeks but trying a differrent hotel that's more on the strip. I'd still consider Trump for future stays though if there's a really enticing rate. It's a a reallly nice place to relaxe and although it's not ON the strip, you can get some nice views of the strip.",0,0,0

The price was reasonable as I used priceline express deals.  For the most part, Trump is typically the lowest priced 5 star available in North Strip.

The room was nice and had a microwave and empty refrigerator.  My gf really liked the soaker tub, just remember that the water level needs to be high enough before it allows you to actuate the water jets.  As others have mentioned, since there is no casino, it is quick access to the rooms on the elevators.  We had a room on the strip side so we did not hear any train noises in the middle of the night.

We wound up just wanting to relax and lay out near the pool on Sat.  We were able to reserve a daybed for $50 F&B (food and beverage) minimum for spring season.  This is very reasonable for Vegas and we got above the minimum with 4 drinks.  The pool area was small but good enough for us since we didn't want to be at a day club.  Unfortunately, the DJ music there was pretty loud and detracted from the experience, hence minus 1 star.

For location, it is off strip but not so bad.  We cut through the Fashion show mall one time and walked along the street from the strip another time.  Probably added 10-15 minutes of walking, which isn't bad.  We also used the shuttle to Caesar's once which was very convenient.  The valet was hit and miss.  It took 5 mins, 20 mins, and 3 mins to get our car the 3 times we used it. I did park at Nordstroms across the street a couple of times when I knew I was going to be driving again shortly.  

Overall 4 out of 5 starts.  We may stay here again, especially since I can often find it on priceline for slightly above $100\/night on a Fri & Sat.",0,0,0

I would have never normally picked this place (I didn't even really know where it was), and for it to be labeled as a Strip hotel is a little bit of an exaggeration. It's tucked away behind the mall -- not on the Strip at all. No casino or cool lobby bar inside. It's just a hotel. The rooms are pretty luxe (marble everything in the bathroom, TV in the bathroom mirror, comfy bed, etc.), but some of the rooms face the train tracks and can get pretty noisy. I was little disappointed when we got our room. I had spoken with an agent beforehand to let her know we were celebrating our engagement and requested a room (specifically) not near the train tracks and wanted to see if we could upgrade to a Strip view. She worked with me and assured me both of those things would happen. Neither of them did. Instead, we got a noisy room with a view of the freeway and strip clubs.

There's a shuttle that goes to the Wynn and to Caesar's, which is useful if you make it before they stop running (2AM and 12AM, respectively). The service was nice enough, but all in all, I wouldn't consider this a 5* hotel. I was very disappointed with the fact that I got this place after booking a 5* on the Strip; had I purchased insurance, I would have cancelled it and booked elsewhere. There's a $25 resort fee per day, too, which includes internet, pool, spa access, shuttle service, etc. 

If you're looking for a quiet getaway, this could be the place for you. A pretty nice pool, luxe amenities and a pretty glitzy interior. If you're looking for a Vegas getaway -- on the Strip, a fun environment with lots of entertainment on-site, stay away. Even at the rate we got ($108\/night + resort fee), I would reconsider booking here. Might be worth to spend a little more and get a hotel on the Strip!",0,0,0

A few minor nits that prevent five stars:
- Our suite included a kitchenette with dishwasher, but no knives, cutting board, or detergent.  Also, the stovetop only goes up to around medium compared to a standard range.  Fortunately we mostly ate out.

The jets in the tub weren't functional. The bath is huge and comfortable all by itself, but some jacuzzi-like action would have been amazing.

The water pressure in the shower is dismal, and the sensor is faulty. We couldn't get the water a decent temperature -- it was either super hot or really cold. 

The train. Oh, the train. Our room overlooked the tracks, and the noise from the horn blaring was unacceptable. If Trump knew that this was happening, there should have been better sound-proofing on this side of the hotel. My other friends didn't have this issue with their rooms, since they were on a different side of the tower.

Now the good.

The hotel itself is pretty.

There is no casino, so it's quiet and convenient to walk from the front up to the room.

There is a free shuttle that runs to the Wynn and to Caesar's Forum Shops (and to some outlets, I believe) every 10-15 minutes. We spent the majority of our time at the Wynn, so this was awesome. 

Room service at 4am was amazing. The chicken noodle soup was a group favorite.

Cons: 
There is a mandatory resort fee $15 per day (I think), which is kind of rip off, I wish Priceline can filter these kind of fees out.
this place is valet only, but the problem is the location is off the strip (about a 6 mins walk to Wynn), so if you want to walk around at night on the strip you can either walk, call a taxi or take the valet out, just not so convenient.

The service was outstanding.  Trump trains his people well.  I also was pleased that there was no extra fee for the well appointed fitness area.

Again, the bill came and this time the server says, the tip in included in the service charge.  What?!?  So the first server lied... not good!  Of course we took it up with the hotel and they took the tip, I had added on, off the bill.  OK.  But do not pay for the gazebo!  Seriously... not worth it.  The service was not good.  The hotel was OK... We probably will not stay there again.  The restaurant was terrible... food and service.  The rooms were pretty nice, and we did see The Donald one day, so that was fun! 

AND THE BEST PART:  The shower doors are really big and VERY heavy.  One morning, I got out of the shower, reached for a towel and my fingers got slammed in the shower.  I probably needed stitches, but the skin was gone around the index finger.  The other fingers were swollen and bruised.  Hotel personnel comes up and takes pictures of my hand etc., fill out forms etc.  I ask him if he can help me with my bags as I need to get going (airport bound).  He said he could call the bell hop.  I asked him to find out how long before the bell hop...  (Due to the drama of the fingers, I was running behind schedule).  About 20 minutes.  I could not wait, so I started pushing three bags to the elevator, while holding onto a bag of ice.   I get in the elevator, and then he shows up!  UGH....

On Saturday night, they had no other room to offer and brought us a portable fan. Although it was helpful and the maintenance men were very nice, the problem could not be fixed so late at night. We slept in the living room because the AC functioned great in that area. 

On Sunday, the maintenance team worked throughout the day to troubleshoot the AC. It was 8pm before it was certain that the AC was not functioning at all.

Love that this location is so close to the Wynn and fashion mall. I also love their nonstop shuttles to the Wynn and forum shops. It's easy to take the free shuttle to and from forum shops then head out further south from there instead of taking a cab or walking.

The pool area I think could be nicer... I feel the hot tubs are only ok and kinda smelled weird around them last time we were there. Also the bar used to do an awesome happy hour (still do happy hour but it's not awesome)... U were able to get any specialty cocktail for 5$ ... Now just well drinks. Boo. 

The one bedroom suites come with a very high end little kitchen which is great if u are gonna buy drinks or have leftovers to microwave up or store in the fridge.

The rooms were clean and had good views, but my friend and I had adjoining rooms and would loved to have had doorstops to keep our doors open so we could talk to eachother. What's also weird was that compared to the Aria, where our friends were staying, we had like NO toiletries. Come on....

At one point, my tv wouldn't work and at a different point, hers didn't. All in all, it's a good thing we barely spent any time in the actual room. 

I will say though one great impression I had about the hotel was that the valet guys were amazing and so helpful. They offered to drive us places, and made sure that we always had a ride. The shuttle to the Wynn and Caesars was always available and pretty convenient. 

Sure, I might suggest my parents who don't drink or gamble come stay at the Trump, but i know my girls and I will not be heading back here on our bi-annual Vegas trips.",1,0,0

Just.. Really freaking disappointed. Thought a resort would offer better services than this. Boo, not a hotel I would ever stay at again.

We checked in and after walking into our room found what appeared to be lipstick stains on the sheets. We asked them to please come up and change the sheets for us as soon as possible because we we needed to get ready for dinner. Apparently an hour later when they still weren't there was what they meant by ASAP. We decided to get ready while we waited at this point and when we were finished there was still nobody there even though when we called with a reminder they assured us they were ""on the way up."" 

Thinking that our issue was behind us, we went to sleep hoping to sleep in the next morning. However, the freight train starts at 5:30AM and it is LOUD. By loud I mean fog horn in your ear LOUD. We asked if they could switch our rooms while we were out since we couldn't sleep past 530AM. They said they would, totally unsurprised that we were woken at such an early hour.

We returned back for our new room, and entered it ready to finally relax. When we walked it the entire room smelled like the bottom of ocean. Sooooo fishy and gross. We asked if they could again, please move us to another room before we got settled. They said ""NO"". I was in shock. No? Why not? ""We are booked,"" they said. OK then put us in a suite. I don't care what they need to do to make this right but do it. Miraculously, a room opened up. Like the parting of the sea, it was a miracle! I begged them at least 3 times, whatever you do please don't use any scented sprays in the room as someone in our party had extremely severe asthma. They promised they wouldn't use any sprays. Great! We were happy.

We opened the door...before setting foot in the room a cloud of perfume and spray and everything else consumed us. I couldn't believe it. It was almost as if they tried to spite us!! 

I would like to add through this entire process we asked to speak to a manager and were never afforded the opportunity.

After opening the final door, we came down found a manager ourselves and let him know we would now be checking out. As I write this review, he promised he would find us a room that worked and we are waiting. I pray this room will be OK, but regardless our dinner reservation this evening has come and gone.

It would be nice if anyone at this hotel did anything prior to this to help as we asked nicely and explained ourselves reasonably. In the hopes that this final room works out, it was very stressful and this hotel did nothing to ease that stress or help us relax on our vacation! I do not recommend this hotel at ALL.

Also, if that wasn't reason enough - it is NOT that nice and NOT on the strip in case you were asking yourself why to stay here.

I definitely pulled a free room upgrade with a $20 between my drivers license and CC so that was even better. The room I had was an exquisite 300sqft gem with super plush sheets, a hot tub with bubbles, martini mixer, refridgerator with mini bar and a full lounge area with flat screen TV. It was exquisite. 

The bad news is that theres no casino here though that didn't bother me whatsoever - all the rooms are non smoking - again, not an issue for me - but it is definitely a good distance off the strip and too far to walk to the cool clubs..and cabs are expensive.

My party had two rooms at this place, so we were able to get adjoining rooms.  Actually, to do that, we had to upgrade (they told us most of the rooms were sold out), but the upgrade was only $20 per room per night, and we ended up with a Strip view on the 47th floor.  The view was absolutely terrific.  We fit 9 people into the two rooms, and it was fairly comfortable.  It's a pretty decked out place, and has a kitchen.

In contrast to most other Vegas hotels, this hotel does not have any shows, entertainment, or nightlife in the hotel.  It does have a pool and gym facility, which we made use of and enjoyed.  However, the lack of other amenities could be good or bad, depending on your point of view.  On one hand, it was nice to be able to walk into the hotel and not be bombarded with flashing lights, slot machine beeps, and the like (that's my opinion of most other Vegas hotels)  The Trump is peaceful and classy, if a bit flashy (gold trim and chandelier columns in the lobby).

However, the lack of nighlife is a bit of a disadvantage in my opinion.  It's so much more convenient to be able to go to a club, restaurants, and even a show in your own hotel.  It's not a huge knock on this hotel, it just depends what you're more interested in.  I'm glad to have tried this place out.

I've stayed at several strip hotels that have extremely plush, comfortable mattresses (Encore, Wynn, Palazzo, THEhotel, etc..)  This one was hard and felt cheap.  Second, I turned the shower on and realized the knob's hot switch was actually the opposite of what it says...Not a huge deal but when you expect a certain standard to be met, it is very noticeable.

-Turn-down service was rescheduled until 9pm, but they still came at 7pm during our in-room dinner
-During in-room dining, they forgot to bring our ranch dressing and LOST the bill so we had to wait 10 minutes for both

-Doormen and women were uninterested in assisting us at times.  Other times they were helpful.  
-I signed my mom up for a SPA treatment and paid for with my credit card.  I offered 10% extra gratuity on top of the 20% mandatory because i am generous.

PROS:

-The SPA treatment my mom had was very relaxing and nice, per my mom. 


Overall, we had high expectations of Trump International.  We usually stay at other penthouse rooms or luxury hotels but we wanted to make Trump our go to hotel for many reasons.

Housekeeping quality was spotty.  Valet took a long time, even though I was the only one waiting for a car, and was generally inattentive.  On the day we checked out, an attendant saw us lugging our bags by ourselves (I had my two little nieces with me) and he did nothing to help us.  He stood there and saw us load the bags into the trunk and did nothing.  How in the world can they call themselves a 5-star hotel?

But the real rub was the billing.  CHECK YOUR CREDIT CARD STATEMENT CAREFULLY.  They conveniently charged me an extra night, and after some back-and-forth, they said it was because I'd stayed for 3 nights, not 2 nights.  I told them I'd be happy to fax over my check-out receipt, which clearly stated 2 nights.  They stewed on it for a few days and then came back saying, ""We're charging you an extra night because the room was in a terrible condition when you left it.""  Excuse me?  I was traveling with two little girls, not Aerosmith!  If you're going to lie, at least make up a good one!  They did give me a refund, but only after I accused them of blatant cheating.

The basic deal is that the Trump is a 5 star hotel. Now, 5 stars makes one think fancy. Though, to get stars a hotel only seems to have to offer certain services, like room services etc. It doesn't have to be fancy.

The Trump is pretty much a Holiday Inn, only the bed is firmer at the holiday Inn and the TV larger. The TV was the size of my laptop screen at the Trump. They have a stove and sink, which the Holiday Inn doesn't have.

The evil trick that got me here is Priceline. I bid on Priceline half of what all the other 5 star hotels (the real 5 star hotels) charge. Priceline put me in the Trump, which charges half of what the other 5 star hotels charge for a good reason.

The room is an orchestra. The steal ropes of the elevator sing as they catapult people up dozens of floors in seconds. The air conditioning hisses. The refrigerator rumbles. And, everything gets drowned out by the passing fright trains. They don't honk their horn. They lean on it like someone was on the track and the operator in mad panic tried to get the person to move out of the way.

A nice touch is that the Trump gives away wifi and two small water bottles for free. I know Holiday Inn gives you free wifi as well. Though, every other Vegas hotel will nickel and dime you for every little thing (more like $20 bills). The gym is free. Though, it's not great.

I'm not the right target demographic. If you are looking for a place to put grand pa, it's perfect. It's quiet (= no Vegas party, what everyone comes for). There are no casinos, clubs, or pool party. Behind the hotel are two strip clubs. We know grand pa likes those. By day, he votes to restrict women's rights and sexual freedom. At night, he sneaks out to get what he outlawed. Oh, Dick Cheney stayed here a few times. I told you grand pa likes it here.

Service, supposedly service is what makes the Trump outstanding. The receptionist walked me to my elevator. I guess that's what extra service looks like. I would have been fine walking by myself instead of having someone say empty platitudes next to me.

The dead bolt on the room was broken. When I called, they said that they would send security up. An hour later, house cleaning arrived with an clothes iron. I guess, the thought was to iron out the wrinkle in my stays. A while later, finally a handy man shows up.

He was a nice guy. He worked really hard. He had to disassemble the whole door. Some of the screws were stripped. Some where jammed in so hard that he couldn't get them loose.

He kept beeping. Yes, after having given staff Blackberries for a while, management realized that some people were making personal calls. So, they took them away and gave people pagers. Don't you just love it, when companies try to save pennies by taking away the tools that employees need to do great work?


I have stayed at the Wynn across the street. That's a great Vegas experience. I have stayed at the Rumor hotel. That's an off strip hotel for when you want to save money. It looks like it's a converted apartment building. Yet, it has hip stuff, like crazy furniture and sexy photography in the room, you know Vegas. And, my absolute favorite is Cosmopolitan. That is super awesome. When I stayed there, I barely left the hotel, because the room was awesome, there was party 24 hours, great club, great pool, great fitness center.",7,6,3

Donald Trump  What are you thinking?  

I'm embarrassed for you.  This is not a 5 star, maybe a 4 star.  Even the official website for this hotel is horrible.  

I don't have the time to list every single *GASP* moment on my stay here.  I was overall disappointed.  Rooms were loud, lobby uninteresting although smelled nice.  I thought the ridiculous resort fee for your ugly community style pool that even closes at 8PM so I couldn't use it at night. The wifi wasn't complimentary (even nasty Motel 6 has free wifi),  staff was apathetic and ridiculously min-wage snobby.  It was severaly understaffed.  No call down valet.  So I waited and waited on a valet and subsequently was late for my dinner reservation.  Then upon return to the hotel, I was asked by a valet to park the car myself!!!  Can you believe it? No casino down stairs. No other floor plans other than a king bed and very uncomfortable couch bed (which we were told by staff to make up ourselves).  NICE! TRAIN NOISE IS HORRIBLE and I was on the opposite side of the building and on the 52nd floor!! Oh, almost forgot----the jacuzzi tub in the bathroom appeared to be clean so I got in and tried it out (thinking this is the only nice thing I've encountered at this place).  I got out drained the tub and GROSS!!--some nasty blue, green residue was everywhere on the tub and all over me.  YUCK, NASTY!

The roll away wasn't much better and we ended up taking mattress off of it and putting on floor. Service is good and place was clean .

Pros:
- Smoke free (there's only a few hotels that are smoke free in Vegas; I'm allergic to cigarette smoke and this is one of the few hotels where I can breathe!)
- Pet friendly (I have 2 ESAs, and they are accommodating and nice to pets here, there's also a patch of grass to walk the dogs, also easy in and out with pets bc you don't have to wind through a casino)
- Rooms (I only stay in the corner 1 bedroom suite. Large comfy bed with floor to ceiling windows and views of Vegas, newer mattresses; HUGE beige marble master bath with walk in shower, large jetted tub with view of Vegas behind the tub, and toilet; 2nd marble bathroom with shower and toilet; kitchen and sub zero fridge; living room with floor to ceiling windows and views of Vegas)
- Gym (nice, clean gym with towel service)
- Front desk staff (friendly, courteous, professional, attentive)
- Room service (takes about 15-30 minutes. There are a few vegan options on the menu which is hard to find with most room service menus) 
- Valet (quick valet, friendly) 
- House Escalade (a fun perk is the house car, the driver has taken us to Mr Chow at Cesars and Capital Grille) 
- Shuttle (they offer a shuttle that takes you to casinos)
- Location (across the street from fashion show mall and the wynn)
- Clientele (respectful and upscale guests; Thankfully the macho drunk dudes or crying bachelorette groups with their shoes off stay at other hotels). This is a classy hotel not a party hotel. 
- Decor (gorgeous marble, crystal chandeliers, 24k gold windows, its gaudy but i love love love gaudiness; it's NYC 5th avenue meets Vegas glamour.) it has a Daddy Warbucks feel. Pure luxury. 

Cons:
- Height (this could be a ""pro"" if you are not afraid of heights! most people love to be on the higher floors, this hotel goes up to 62nd floor and is one of the tallest in Vegas. I think I'm the only person who requests a lower floor lol however the lower floors are undergoing renovations right now, so you pretty much will be above the 30th floor. I'm up near the 50th and it's high up! Breathtaking views, but if you are scared of heights or have pets (for a quicker elevator ride), I'd recommend a floor lower than 30. Also I prefer the regular elevators rather than the speed elevators.",3,0,3

The room was very nicely decorated and all but that's pretty much the end of the good stuff. We're told there is a butler service or something like that but it ends at 6pm or something, so we never had any use of that. When we found out at 10pm there was no cork screw in the room, it took the hotel 40 minutes or so to get us one. There is no 24 hour room service. It ends at midnight or so. And the bar closes too at that time. One restaurant, I think, though we never made use of it. The worst part? I'm a professional software developer and I could not get the Internet service to work. For your information, the nearest hotspot that I could find is at the Starbucks in the far end of the Fashion Show mall across the street.
So what is the target group of this hotel? Clearly not party people and there is no gambling. Kids would hate it. I think it targets Trump's peers: people over 60 who want to go gamble at Wynn and then get a nice, good sleep in a quiet room in the golden phallos.
Oh, the fitness room was pretty nice though, but I think it cost me extra. And yes there was basic kitchen equipment in the room, which was nice but doesn't add any stars.

Checking in was fast and the lady at the front desk very courteous. 

Room:
Bedroom was big, loved the floor to ceiling panaramic view of the strip.
Bed was very comfortable with more than enough soft pillows. 2 seperate closets was nice.

Bathroom:
We lloved the bathroom, probably one of the biggest we've had. 2 sinks with large mirror and a tv built right into it which was pretty cool. toilet area and shower inside a frosted glass enclosure. Huge hot tub in the bathroom with a large window overlooking the strip. There was also a small waher\/dryer in a closet with shelves in the bathroom as well.

Living room:
It was nice but slightly dated. Couched looked a little worn but comfortable. Had a couple stay with us there and complained about the sofa bed. they had to order another matress because they can feel the bars underneath. They delivered a really thin matress which helped a little. My brother-in-law ended up sleeping on the couch because he couldn't get comfortable. He said the couch was very comy to sleep on. Living room had a additional bathroom with a large glass enclosed shower stall which was a nice touch.

Kitchen:
Small but nice with hi end appliances. And loved the sub zero refrigerator. If i had only 1 complaint would be the lighting in the kitchen. not sure if it was just our unit but too dark for my taste. i like to see what im cooking, I'm thinking they just used low wattage light bulbs--please change the light bulbs its way too dark -- room 3410

H2(EAU)--Poolside Restaurant:
So we just checked in, we were real hungry so we decided to check out the pool area and eat there at the restaurant which was recommended by the porter and  the front desk.
The couple we were with ordered the chicken sliders--They said they were good. They were crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside.
My wife ordered the grilled  chicken sandwich. I ate half of her sandwich and though the chicken was tender but lacked flavor. They use a basil\/parmesan spread on the sandwich but I've had much better.
I had the club sandwich--Bread was dry and my bacon was burnt. I couldnt understand why they would even serve that. I was gonna return it but we were hungry, just got there and i didn't want to complain, although i should have. 
Seasoned waffle fries were really good.

DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE PRICE CONSIDERING THEY WERE ALL $15 SANDWICHES. I'VE EATEN MUCH MUCH BETTER AT CHEAPER PLACES.

Shuttle service:
They have shuittle service to the Wynn and Caesars Palace. We used them twice to Caesars palace and was very pleased with this service. Drivers were very prompted and friendly

Concierge:
This is a desk that i use often and expect the best service, well that didn't happen. Asian\/Filipino guy was not too helpful and definitely not friendly at all. I'll leave it at that

The valet is the only real downside. There is no self-parking and you must have your car taken by a valet. So technically, you will have to tip every time they bring it to you. Knowing my hubby, he's not a big tipper, nor does he like to tip in the first place...so this made him quite unhappy. And the worst thing? The fact that you have to wait about 10 minutes until they finally bring your car around. Not cool. Especially since it was incredibly cold out there.

When we walked in, I was pleasantly surprised to see younger people in their 20's leaving the hotel to go clubbing and bar hopping. Ordinarily, I would be a little bummed out to see these people, but since they weren't clubbing AT the Trump Hotel, I didn't mind at all. I just really don't like to see dressed up, scantily clad girls walking around a hotel and waiting until it's time to walk over to the club in said hotel. So it was nice to see the party people leave the hotel for the night; which you all know what that means...No clubbing music or ""thumping"" to have to listen to if you happen to be staying in!

There is no casino and no smoking, which also disappointed my man, but I enjoyed it. It was different not having to hear the ruckus from a casino or the smell of smoke. There is one thing I should note; the door to the suite looks like a two door suite, but when you open it, there were two more doors, one was our suite room number, and the other door was the suite next door.

And since it was cold and it did rain the weekend we went, we took the cab everywhere on the strip.  Really nice hotel for a group of ladies in vegas for a bachlorette....highly recommend it.  Ive stayed at venetian also, and if you like that hotel, you'll definitely love this one.",0,0,0

I will never stay at Trump International again. 

We stayed in a beautiful modern suite on the 57th floor.  The room was amazing! The bathroom, awesome.. especially the tub!  However, the suite we were in (5722)... the sheets were dirty and the towels were dirty...the light bulb was out, the tv was out, the iron didn't work, the cabinet hinge was broken, the coffee pot filter was dirty - even after 4 times of putting the water through....  but all of that i can let slide... 

The worst part about staying here was the noise at night.. no not noise from your neighbors.. It appears that Donald did not have his hotel sound proofed so even on the 57th floor you can hear the train down the street, sirens and cars... not to mention that the trains blow their horn 3-4 times when passing by... A train goes by every 2 hours or so, so good luck sleeping at night.. (even my ear plugs did not work)...  

overall, it is a beautiful looking hotel with a great addition that there is no casino and night life. it's quiet and you don't have to breathe in second hand smoke... but our room experience was so bad that we will never stay here again.",5,2,0

However, this is an awesome hotel! Upon checking in, we got in during peak time and there was a good 10-or-more-deep-line I'm the lobby. We shuffled our jetlagged butts on over to stand in line. As we waited, we were given complimentary wine. Good ol alcohol!! 
The line seemed quick after that glass, concierge was very polite and friendly as they quickly checked us in and gave us our room keys. 
We were on the 17th floor with our friends who we set up in the room next to ours. Our rooms had a common door\/foyer which opened up to our actual room doors. 
My hubby and I were in a 1 bedroom suite and our friends in a studio suite. Both equipped with hot tub and kitchenettes. Our 1 bedroom had a washer\/dryer, perfect for those who pack light or have kids.
I felt like everything in our suite was awesome, my only comment was the toilet. Only because the pressure of the flush was so low that it couldn't push anything down. It wasn't major for me because we had two toilets in our suite. Our friends on the other hand, only had one and they too had the same comment. For some reason, when you're on vacation you tend to think that you can eat anything and everything. When you eat everything, everything has to come out...catch my drift?!
Anyway, valet service was excellent. Never had to wait more than five minutes for our car even during peak times. We did not deal much with Trump staff, as we were barely ever in the hotel, other than to sleep and get ready for our day. 
I did notice a lounge or restaurant area to the right side of the lobby and a Trump store, which carried Ivanka Trump merchandise. We also visited the PL -pool level. Unfortunately, we visited during closed hours so we didn't actually see the pool. The PL also had the fitness rooms and spa. 
Forgot to mention, the hotel keys came with a $25 voucher for the spa. 
I would not mind staying here again and I definitely recommend it if you don't mind leaving the hotel to hit the casino or standing by the driveway for a smoke.",2,2,2

First off, there's no way that every single room was full when it wasn't a busy weekend and there are a ton of other hotels on the strip with open rooms. Second, it was really lame that they couldn't do anything to help us out considering they supposedly overbooked their hotel. Of course, the 3rd party pointed the finger at trump hotel and trump hotel pointed the finger at the 3rd party. We wasted over an hour of time of our vacation getting this sorted out.

here why:
My friends and I were here to celebrate graduation for the weekend. Brittney at the counter kindly checked us in and said they will be taking $1000 for the deposit and made me sign a sheet saying that ""we won't go crazy."" Well, we didn't. 

However, before  checking out I noticed a charge for $250 of 'smoking fee' and I naturally complained while checking out to tell them I wasn't notified of any non-smoking regulations or fees. An employee told me that they were specifically trained to focus on the non-smoking part and mentioning a non-refundable $250 fee. I told her I spoke with Brittney who didn't mention of this rule and told her I needed to see the form I signed. When she came back, the paper had the non-smoking part circled, which I definitely don't remember when I checked-in. Soon, the manager came to tell me that he was the one who circled and admitted that he had the employee lie on behalf of him. Surprisingly, I didn't get the smoking fee refunded and MOREOVER, the manager spoke to me in a threatening tone, asking if I was using other substances besides tobacco. Uhm, Excuse ME? I was paying $1,500 to stay in your penthouse for the weekend and I do not expect for me and my friends to be accused of engaging in illegal activities just because I was smoking cigarettes. 

Regardless of the clean 5-star hotel look and the chill housekeeping staff (that I tipped a lot) this hotel should NOT be getting any customers who are planning a ""Las Vegas"" experience. Please do reconsider.",7,1,1

We lucked out on a luxury suite with a strip view on the 58th floor by being upgraded free for my birthday.   That definitely made the entire first-time experience in Vegas worth it!  The hotel has a pool deck with a cafe\/restaurant H2eau, fitness center, which we didn't not utilize but was nice to have.  The pool area is very very nice, the pool is kind of small for a large hotel this size but the seating and lay-out areas were plenty to catch some sun.  We also didn't get to use this feature due to chilly weather in November.  Our suite had a small kitchenette, microwave, and fridge stocked with two bottles of water, and large enough to put our own drinks or food in.  The closets light up automatically and have two doors per closet... (yes two closets!)  Plenty of drawer space to put away clothes and belongings.  I was a bit disappointed that our cocktail shaker didn't have a top and that our room was missing bath robes and slippers.  No big, the staff was always very friendly and courteous in helping us get what we needed.  
The shuttles only go to the Whynn Hotel Resort and to the Caesar's Palace Forum Shops.  However, if planned correctly you can always go to the Caesar's and walk on to the Bellagio or Planet Hollywood areas.  If not, you have to hop a cab from one of the resorts on the strip.  I recommend using Bell Trans shuttle for transport to and from the airport.  If you have questions, you can also ask your shuttle drivers at the Trump about destinations on the strip.  
Oh, not to mention the bathrooms in the suites have a jacuzzi!!!!!!  Nice plus to help you relax and rub down your sore feet after a night out on the town.  
I would definitely come to the Trump Las Vegas again, where there is value and luxury environment.  It's also directly across the street from the Fashion Show mall, so you're a hop, and a skip away from great shopping nearby.  A taxi from the airport will be approximately around $18-20 going locally, not on the highway.  
The best way to get around from here is to take the shuttles and walk or hail a cab.  Just depends if you're willing to go for a stroll and see the sights or not.

1) I NEVER have to touch a door once I leave my room. Their doormen are so on top of things. PERIOD. I can't even say that for any other 5-star on the Strip (and I've stayed at my fair share of them).

2) The tubs are serious business. After my second time staying in a standard room here, I picked up a bottle of bubble bath soap and just went to town. Totally recreate your ""Pretty Woman"" bubble bath scene. Go ahead!

3) Branding: HHonors members: believe it or not, this is a Hilton property (one of 3 or 4 on the Strip, actually). Rack 'em up!

I hate that this property is so far from the Strip (try walking in 110F degree heat from the hotel to Las Vegas Blvd and tell me it's close... I dare you). Yes, they do have shuttles (but it's not the same!)

I love that it's across the street from the ""more affordable\/realistic"" Fashion Show Mall (yes, ladies, this is a godsend if you need to buy last-minute items for the clubbing scene).

Valet: Mandatory FREE valet (well, it's included in the resort fee). They only lost my car once but they found it within 1\/2 an hour.

Casino: None.

Smoking: Not allowed.

Pet Friendly: Yes.

We were lucky enough to get a 1 bedroom suite overlooking The Strip and it was gorgeous.
The hotel staff is incredibly friendly and professional
As mentioned already there's no casino and no smoking in the lobby.

So I'll go over some things that are fresh in my mind.

Pool - pretty standard rectangular pool, gets pretty crowded on Fridays and Saturdays but we (group of 4) were always able to find something when we went down (later in the afternoon\/early evening).
The wait staff is very pleasant for service at the pool, only qualms is that it closes at 8 pm during the summer.

Valet is free but they do expect tips.  Not bad if it's a once in a while thing (especially if you're driving other people and will split it)
Otherwise there is parking across the street.

The main lobby is generally open\/not crowded.  Check in on Saturday took about 10 minutes, Check out on Monday took about the same time.

The 1 bedroom suite had a incredible bedroom with an incredible bathroom.  It had a spacious dual head shower and a incredibly large jacuzzi bathtub that was able to fit 2 small\/medium adults comfortably.  The different jet settings were lovely.

There are 2 free shuttles from the hotel
One goes to the fashion mall which is nice if you want to go there (it saves you a 5-10 minute walk, but other than that seems somewhat odd)  
There's also a shuttle that goes further out, but it's only once an hour and we never seemed to be heading out when it was.

It is off the strip but they provide a convinient shuttle to Ceasars and Wynn. Our driver was very entertaining! My complaint would be the water in our bathroom. It took FOREVER to get warm water in the shower! I am talking about a good 10 minutes, no exageration! And when the water finally got warm, it would not stay at a consistent temperature. My parents complained of the same issue in their room as well. My other complaint is we had lunch their restaurant and although our waitress was very friendly, the service was not great.

I've had the opportunity to stay in many luxury hotels in the past, and although there's been a fair share of hotels that have not lived up to their name\/hype, Trump definitely takes the cake as far as crappy service and hideous accomodations.

I stayed there for 2 nights with three other girls to celebrate a bachelorette party.  My friend had booked 2 adjoining suites through www.hotels.com and since I was flying in 2 hours earlier, she called the hotel and put my name on the reservation.  Needless to say, when I got there, my name was nowhere to be found.  When a manager was called over, he said that my friend was suppose have called www.hotels.com instead.  What the hell?  Why shouldn't you be able to call the hotel directly?

I sat in the lounge for 2 hours, waiting for my friends to arrive.  When they finally did and we went to check in together, guess what?  My name had miraculously appeared on the reservations.  Of course, the SAME GIRL who tried to check me in a couple hours prior was the same one we had to deal with - and she never bothered to tell me that my name finally appeared on the confirmed reservations even though she knew I was waiting in the lounge.

Other front desk nightmares: there were no adjoining rooms left but when I started to complain (loudly), suddenly one opened up.  It took the girl 20 MINUTES to check us in.  No joke - I was timing it!  When we checked out, they messed up on BOTH our bills.  And charged us a RESORT FEE PLUS TAX for each room, each night we stayed.

On to the rooms.  Talk about run-down and disgusting.  Let me just list a FEW things that were broken: alarm clock didn't work, closet door wouldn't open, remote control was broken, mattress was too small for the bed frame so our comforter kept sliding down into the huge gap at our feet, and our padlock didn't even work!  The best thing is, we got one king-size bed instead of two beds in each room.  Umm, hello?!?!  There were four of us checking in!!!!

Complimentary valet parking - prompt service, efficient, we can drop off our car and pick up our car smoothly. Just pay them some tip. :) I don't believe the hotel offers self-parking, since we weren't able to find the lot.

FREE wi-fi comes with the stay, since you are paying for the resort fee. You can log in multiple devices to the wi-fi, such as laptop and phone (or tablets). 

Upon entering the hotel, there was a long line to check-in. However, a lady hostess would walk up to you to offer you some Trump bottled water. It made the line less daunting, since they seem so busy on Friday afternoon. When we checked-in, we requested a higher floor, and they were nice enough to accommodate. We got the 35th floor! :) I think the highest floor is 56 or something in the 50s.

Rooms were nice and spacious; no complaints there. I went to check out the pool downstairs too, and it was a huge rectangle. Nice night-time views of Encore from a distance. and good lighting too if you want to go at dusk. The pool water is heated as well; so even thought it was winter -- you can still swim or dip your feet. I chose the latter.

Nice cushions \/ seating in the pool area too. There's a gym (free to use w\/ resort fee), but I didn't get to use it. I can see how this hotel would qualify as a 5-star hotel. It definitely had many ""kids"" at the hotel this past wknd; so Trump is not necessarily adult-only. Maybe the prices were just so affordable this wknd, so we had many families staying here.

Overall, we had a good stay w\/ the Trump Hotel and wouldn't mind coming back in the future if the room rates are reasonable. :) It's a easy breezy walk from the strip.

We loved the ""courtesy shuttle"" they offered, where it drops you off at either Wynn or Caesars Palace. So convenient, especially when we wanted to go to Caesars for the buffet and the Celine concert! :) The shuttle leaves every 15-20 min to these 2 destinations. They also pick-up from those hotels and drop you back off at Trump.",8,2,1

I gave it a one star and it was posted on Mar.23.2014.  Before my stay at the Trump, I had never requested to change hotel rooms in my entire life, not even in a Holiday Express. At Trump, I had to request to change room twice. I booked a one-bedroom suite with strip view and I specifically asked for a quiet room as we have a toddler that needs to nap. The first room we got was at the back of the property directly facing the train tracks. Second room we were taken to smelled like a smoker's residence. Did they think they could get away with that? No apologies were offered at any point and to top that off, Heather at the front desk told us we would not be charged extra!!  The crib I asked for three times did not show up until I phoned down to housekeeping. And there was no toilet paper in our suite. I went down to complained to Jared, the manager on duty at the front desk. To make it right, he offered me a couple of pairs of slippers. (Woohoo!) No compensation was offered until I asked for it, then he comped me one night of resort fee. What a charmer! Quite a few things in our suite were broken or not working properly, due to lack of maintenance or wear and tear. We've stayed at most 5-star hotels on the strip and the Trump is worth at best a 4-star, with very limited amenities to offer, and no wow factor. The Attache service is a joke, with zero out of my two requests fulfilled. Nobody ever followed up with us to make sure the rest of our stay was satisfactory. It's in an isolated location of the strip. The only plus is you can walk over to the Fashion Show mall when it's open. This hotel has the audacity to charge a $25 daily resort fee, for all the things that are free with other hotels. Even on the quiet side of the hotel, we still got woken up by trains every night. Our daughter learned to cover up her ears whenever she went down for her sleep. On the plus side, most employees we've encountered were eager to please. The extra half bathroom got the most use as our toddler slept in the bedroom. To sum up, I was not at all surprised with the absence of management response to my TripAdvisor review. That's exactly why this property deserves only a 2-star rating. Any organizations that do not recognize or respond to their customers' complaints are destined to fail. I sincerely hope this is not a hallmark of the Donald's standard of excellence.",0,0,0

The only difference is that the other hotels on the strip your walking a mile through the casino to get to your room vs. the street like at Trump. This is definitely not a deal breaker and the street is well lit. 

I have had the pleasure of staying at many 5 star hotels and this is not one of them. I would rate it as a 4 star.

Here is why this is a four star hotel and not a five.
- Stove in room did not work. They said they would have to call for service. I declined because I hate having people in my room when I'm not there.
- Black scuff marks on the ceiling
- Toilet clogged up 3-4 times every day. What a pain! 
- Box of Kleenex was soaking wet upon arrival
- Radio in room is not bluetooth
- When waiting for a ride or valet to bring your car there isn't any seating available outside. I saw people actually sitting on the ground.

The good
- The view
- Big room
- Pool was the best part! It has a cool vibe with good music and view. Some people wanted the music louder but I thought it was perfect!
- Hotel room is nice and the bed is comfortable however it does not have a five star feel. I think it was due to the bland decor.
- Staff was nice overall but the staff at the pool and doorman(s) were excellent. They made my experience that much better.

Overall I would stay again but not with 5 start expectations. Its not a party hotel which is absolutely fine but I think their pool is too nice not to house some party events a couple times a year.",3,0,1

That fantastic smell as you enter their lobby, ""Wow!"" The non smoking atmosphere, we love. The room that we got was fantastic! We were on the 48th floor, a room with a view of the strip, including the Airport, Bellagio, the Fashion show mall, etc, ""Wow!"" they can accommodate little doggie, ""Yay!""  Valet parking were also great!  The shuttle to and from Wynn and Caesar's were also great! You had spoiled us, and there is no other way, but to go back there again!

The only irky thing for us is your resort fee, not included as if we have a choice of not paying it. Do we? Anyway, yes it was at the far end of the strip across from the Wynn and if you get home passed midnight, Trump shuttle stop and two options left, walk or get a $15.00 taxi, we choose walking! And you know what? We love, love it. Great exercise and far enough that we really burned up some calories with all those out of this world food and drink that we had, all day!

Cons: Valet only, resort fee (but every hotel on the strip has one), no turn down service, if your get a ""city view"" room it's noisy because the trains, no casino, & freeway noise.

Old water in our tea kettle that we didn't put in there.

It's very relaxing and calming to enter a pristine building free of the stimulants and lights that make you never want to sleep in LV. 

Being here before the pools open, however, is something else. I wish there was something else to do here, and would have loved it had Trump had an indoor pool with a huge resort-style pool outdoors. During the winter and spring the resort fee seems really absurd since the Trump is not a resort and business-oriented hotels do not charge a resort fee. The majority of guests here were part of business conferences at the nearby convention centers.

A definite plus, this hotel is very dog-friendly and unlike the other hotels on the strip, there wasn't a trace of smoke in the lobby. The parking situation is valet-only, which makes it easy to get around, but a pain if you're in a hurry since you could be waiting for 5-10 minutes. 

The rooms are sophisticated and the strip view is awesome. Also, the kitchenette is a huge help to those with dietary restrictions, or if you just prefer a real coffeemaker, mini range and fridge.",5,2,2

You may appreciate this if you want a more secluded hotel to stay in. You may hate this if you're into the busy action on the strip and nightlife. Personally, I liked how it was sort of off the strip, and having the mall right across the street during Black Friday was super convenient.

Since the building was supposed to originally be a condo tower, there is no casino and public parking structure... which means it's super quiet at night and nightly valet parking. I don't like strangers driving my car 'cause they mess with the radio, rear view mirrors, etc. I don't care if I'm as wealthy as Paris Hilton, I'm pretty sure I'll always prefer to park my own car. Therefore, I didn't dig handing over the car whenever we wanted to go back and waiting at least 10 minutes for valet to retrieve our car.

Now onto the thing I REALLY enjoyed:

The room we were given was huge. There was mini kitchen (fridge, stove, etc), a dining table, a living room area with a sofa bed, a bedroom with one queen, and two full bathrooms.  Of course the one in the living room was smaller but completely usable with a sink, toilet, and decent-sized shower.  The ""master"" bath was insane. I think it was probably bigger than my own bedroom at home... the shower was AMAZING with dual shower heads and big enough to fit 4-5 people! There was also a TV in the mirror. Our room could easily accommodate 15-20 comfortably.

Speaking of rooms, if safety and security are big concerns, you'll love the Trump. In order to get to your room, you have to enter a card key into one door, which will take you into a little foyer with two doors (you and your neighbor). Then you'll have to enter your card key in your designated room. I felt super safe and I really appreciated it... though I'm pretty sure the only reason they did that was because this was supposed to be a condo.

If you want to stay in a luxe, private, quiet hotel, then this is definitely your spot.",9,6,6

We initially booked two rooms and were told that both rooms would be available by 3.  However only one room was finished then while the other wasn't finished until 4:30.  The customer service line takes quite a long time to transfer but we managed to extend our checkout time by an hour.  Hopefully rooms can be finished around the same time in the future or at least we could have been notified of the condition of our other room.  

The Trump Hotel is by far the cleanest hotel we stayed in.  The beds are large and my family comfortable fitted in them despite having five people.  The view isn't amazing and there is some noise from the passing trains but it isn't too distracting from the overall experience.  The TV was in high quality and the kitchen was clean.  We were given complimentary water and the shelves were wiped down and nicely decorated.  There are clean cabinets to place your items and everything appeared to be polished.  The bathroom is amazing!  The shower and toilet was spotless; plus the bathtub had water jets so that was an enjoyable experience.  I would be cautious with the bathroom glass door as there isn't a stopper so there is a risk of hitting your toes and getting a cut.  

The elevator was smooth and efficient; there were different elevators for specific floors so that cut down on the overflow of residents.  There's also a security guard that checks for room keys so that made us feel safer.  The front desk is quick with their service, nothing exceptional but still pleasant.  

We didn't get to use the gym but those exercising had a great view of the pool.  The pool was a bit smaller than expected but it was clean.  The store was small and the merchandise was a bit pricy but expected of the brand.  The valet service is quick and everyone was friendly.  There's an outlet right in front of the hotel so a vehicle isn't needed but it was nice to have great service.  

The greatest component about the hotel is probably the fact that it doesn't allow smoking.  It smells like subtle lotion upon entering and since the hotel doesn't have a casino, the smoke isn't carried throughout the hotel.  Definitely a family friendly option.",9,0,0

I don't smoke or gamble, so this place is perfect for me.  There are enough cons that I can't give them 5-stars, but i would still recommend this hotel.

Pros:
- nonsmoking facility; the hotel is a big breathe of fresh air compared to all the smoke-filled casino hotels
- late check out: don't know how they do it, but since we are Trump-card members (free signup online), we can check out as late as 4pm!  unheard of in the hotel business...so much better then the 10-11am checkout which is becoming more typical.
- price for a room can typically be found for less than $100 (before the resort fee)
- I was impressed with the service at  the front desk...very friendly and helpful

Cons:
- I hate any hotel that has a resort fee; I'm willing to overlook that with the other pros this hotel offers
- the price for anything else here is very expensive (food, spa, etc)
- valet parking only

For the most part, the staff is excellent, the bar staff is very friendly and serves up some great drinks (Marcus is the best). We did have some issues with the shuttle service they offer. The driver told us he picks up every fifteen minutes at the location he dropped us off at. We sat there for almost 45 minutes before we finally gave up and took a cab...only to find him flirting with one of the female valets. The cleaning lady arrived to clean the room very late (almost 4 in the afternoon) while we were getting ready to go to the chapel to get married. Now onto the room...This hotel actually is a perfect metaphor for the man who's last name is on the top of the building....on the exterior, it is classy and posh and exudes wealth, but underneath the surface is just tacky and cheap. We entered our suite and found a large stain on the carpet (In fact, most Best Western rooms have cleaner carpets), most of the cupboards and drawers in the master bath had loose hinges (to the point where they wouldn't close properly), the frame around the mirror was caked with dust and old crusty toothpaste, many of the light switches didn't work, laminate in many places was lifting up. The large king size bed was the most uncomfortable thing I have ever slept on. It would actually have been softer if they just put a sheet over a piece of plywood. The location is horrible. It's off the strip and is a decent walk (which is not a bad thing when you are sober...but when you have been at the tables for awhile and have a bit of a buzz it can be annoying) away.

They chose a bad beige color for the carpets...it shows everything so the carpets were kinda stained which takes away from the ""5 Star"" appeal...though the hotel is nice, I wouldn't call it 5 stars...maybe 4 stars.

Aside from that, everything was great. They gave Ziggy doggy treats and a doggy bed. The room was very spacious with a huge jacuzzi tub which I didn't get to use!

The room: we stayed in a one bedroom which is approximately 1000 sq.ft. with a living room, kitchen, bedroom, master bathroom with a jacuzzi, and another small bathroom. The only downside is there's no kitchenware in the room due to county regulations so you have to call housekeeping if you need utensils, pans or plates. If you call after booking your stay, you can upgrade for only $50 per night. There's a tv in the master bath, bedroom and living room. The decor is somewhat outdated but all quality material. Great AC which is a must when it's 110 degrees outside. 

The amenities: the pool area is simple but the actual pool is large and there was a lot of friendly servers helping us find lounge chairs and taking food and drink orders. The gym is pretty large with up to date equipment. There's a daily resort fee of $29 but valet parking is free. A big plus since some of the casinos are now charging for parking. The bell boys will keep your luggage for you but sometimes they were nowhere to be found. There is no casino on the first floor or featured shows unlike other hotels. 

Check in and out: the wait time can be long, especially during the rush hours early morning and afternoon. We waited over 20 minutes to check in and despite the obviously long line, they didn't bring more receptionists to help. Big shout out to Fletcher at the front desk who was really helpful and kind. 

The major negative is that the hotel is the most northern part of the main strip (north of the fashion show mall). They do have free shuttle service between the hotel, the Wynn and Caesar's Palace that comes every 15 minutes. Trust me you'll need it when the weather's 110 degrees outside.",9,0,0

I stayed at their standard room and OMG. It was HEAVEN. If I were a celebrity living in a hotel - THIS would be my choice hotel. 

It may be off the strip... but SO worth it.

WIN: No smoking, no casino, all classy

This is for the NON gamblers and really the people who want to relax. I'm not much of a party person or gambler. This was perfect for my ""just get away from it all"" weekends. 

STANDARD ROOM: -
Resort fee - $25 - includes wifi, pool, gym etc. 

Like a TINY NY Studio Apartment
Mini kitchen - fridge, microwave, counters, stove
Mini living room - couch, chairs, table
Bed - lots of pillows and plushness - LOVE, TV
Lots of closet space

BATHROOM:
There's a TV in the bathroom! Eek! I love it! 
Jet stream tub
separate glass (be careful) doorway to the toilet and also a shower

CONDIMENTS: 
The shampoo and conditioner stuff was nice. Very good selection - as an Asian - I look at that sh*t. :) Very good quality stuff too.
Free bottled water

BREAKFAST:
We ordered room service - they came in and they set the whole thing up for you in the living room space. They place a table cloth over the table and provide everything for you. 
And the room service was delicious!

PARKING:
Valet parking
My fiance has a sports car that he loves and the valet guy and him were so nice about it that he let my fiance part the car in front of the hotel and he said he'd watch it for us the whole time. Nice guy. Really awesome parking experience. 

SERVICE:
Easy and just awesome. We got in and out and done. Nice chat with the front desk and seriously, just a perfect experience.

OVERALL: 
I love this hotel. Trump... good job.",18,13,14

The CONS:
-Rush hour valet waiting times suck. Expect 15-30 mins
- if your room is towards Palace Station, you'll hear a train coming 3-4 times (blowing horn) while you're sleeping. It sounds like it's really outside your window! Really!

Nestled about a mile and a half away from the Wynn and the famous fun filled Strip and directly across the street from Fashion Show Mall is the beautiful luxurious Trump Hotel and a place that I was excited to call home for 3 nights and 4 fun filled days!!

Not knowing where we were staying, I was a bit confused on where we were going after we exited the highway. Took a couple of turns here, a turn there and came upon the biggest tower I have seen (well outside of the city center hotels). There sparking in the night sky was our hotel! Note to guests staying here: There is no self-parking, only valet parking. 

The Valet staff was beyond professional each time we were there, and did not keep us waiting long for our car.

After handing over our keys, we gathered our things and went into the lobby to check in. The door attendant held the door open for us and said Good Evening and Welcome! Wow, a girl could sure get use to this kind of service! Walking into their grand lobby (no joke this was huge... huge as in I could do multiple cartwheels without running into anything).

Big beautiful and bright chandeliers hung high above and the scent of jasmine filled the lobby (as well as the hallways). The front desk attendant was sweet she also welcomed us and asked how our trip was. After checking us in she gave us free bottles of water, explained that there is a resort fee that is charged each day that will allow us to use the internet, have free bottles of water and covered the valet parking as well as access to their fitness area. We were told we would be on the 24th floor in a Suite; she then took the time to come away from her desk and show us where our elevator was. 

This hotel has a swanky looking bar but no casino, which is nice not to inhale the second hand smoke each time you enter or leave.

Now onto our humble suite: 
We were towards the end of the hall, which was nice and we did not have any neighbors to the left or the right of us either! Entering into our suite, we had a private entry into the first door, a mini hallway, then our door and our neighbor's door to the right of us.

Walking into our suite: I do not know what hit the ground first, my jaw, my eyes or ummmm ummm never mind! This place was perfect and fit for a cupcake princess!

It had a living room
An oversize comfortable looking bed with fluffy pillows
A full kitchen with high-end appliances.
Sub Zero Fridge 
Big closets
Hi def TVs in the bedroom, and even a TV in the incredibly huge bathroom (make that a TV in the mirror).
The bathroom had marble floors and was oversized
Shower could host a huge party. The first night we took showers, it took about 15mins for the hot water to kick in...
A nice deep whirlpool tub in the bathroom that could fit two or more!


This suite was immaculate!


No complaints about this hotel, we would totally stay here again! Only thing that happened was around 4:30-7:00am there is a train that passes through and the horn is loud, how loud you ask? Loud enough to wake the dead or the passed out drunk party people!  By night 2, I slept through it. Just be prepared is all!",16,17,21

Our bevy of vehicles entered the valet parking entrance and were quickly greeted by several very cheerful and swift gentlemen who carefully took our cars into their care and whisked them away. Doormen opened doors into a beautifully appointed foyer area. Fresh flowers were in evidence and everything was sparkling and elegant. My first impressions were of a establishment that took pride in being a resort of note. Check in was easy, and we went up into our rooms. 

Our one bedroom suites on the top half of the hotel were absolutely stunning. Crisp linens, full kitchen, everything spotless. Soft beds, clean sheets, little amenities such as the master bath with whirlpool jets. When we called housekeeping to request utensils, extra tea bags and water, they were brought to our room within fifteen minutes. The staff's deportment was impeccable. Polite, well mannered, professional. 

Fitness center and pool were lovely and easy to access, and none too crowded. 

A shuttle takes you to either Caesars or Encore\/Wynn in swanky Mercedes vans. Extremely convenient! Also, no casinos and no smoking to be seen. Fabulous!

1. This is a 100% non-smoking hotel.  There is a $250 penalty if you smoke anywhere in the facility.
2. There is no casino inside the hotel.
3. There is a resort fee of $32-$35 which covers complimentary water, tea, and coffee in the room; valet parking; access to fitness room, pool, and spa; and free shuttle service to and from Wynn Hotel and Caesar's Palace.
4. Valet only parking, but it's free.  Just make sure you tip the drivers.
5. Slightly off the Vegas strip.
6. There is a train track west of the hotel so it may be a bit noisy in some of the rooms.

I personally didn't mind most of these except for the valet only parking and being next to a train track.  I almost cancelled my reservation but was lured by many of the amenities at the hotel.  I was originally going to stay at Paris Hotel but Trump Hotel offered so much more for the money.  My wife and I stayed in the Superior Room, which is the least expensive room.  Even this room is about 500 sq. ft. and comes with nice appliances like Sub-Zero mini fridge, Wolf electric stove, Bosch convection oven (I think), and even has a small sink.  

Bathroom is gorgeous.  It has nice glass doors for shower and toilet, TV in the mirror, jetted spa tub, and toiletries like shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, soap, and lotion.  I also loved how quickly I was able to get hot water in the shower.  It was almost instant and got super hot.  I'm no positive but I think there was a blow dryer in the bathroom.  

Iron and ironing board are inside the closet.

I was concerned about possible noise from trains so I called in advance and asked if they can put us in a room on the east side (toward Wynn and Encore).  Since we came on a Monday night they were able to accommodate us and gave us a room on the 54th floor on the far east side.  We got a great view and didn't hear any noise from trains.

Check in time is listed as 4 p.m. but we had no trouble checking in early.  Check out time is listed as 11 a.m. but I saw other reviewers indicating they were able to do a late check out at 4 p.m. with no issue.  The website also indicates 4 p.m. check out option if you book directly through the website.  Speaking of which, I got a better deal by booking direct.  

If you don't gamble or smoke, this is a pretty good hotel.  Only reason I took one star off is due to lack of self park option.  I hate valet.",16,7,6

Here is the good and bad:

Good 

- Lobby was swanky, quiet and smelled like delicious flowers! (not disgusting smoke like 99% of the other hotels)
- We were given water bottles while standing in line to check-in (even though there were only 2-3 people ahead of us)
- The DOUBLE SHOWERS and ginormous bathroom for the one bedroom suite
- Fully stocked kitchen that we sadly did not get to take advantage of
- Great service throughout the hotel
- BEST ROBES ever! So velvety and soft :)

Bad 

- Cheap\/thin glass windows. All of us could hear the damned freight train every single morning at 8 AM. We could also hear the sirens from an ambulance and music starting at 8 AM as well. UGH! Thank goodness I brought my ear plugs because I've read many reviews about the noise level. 
- Frayed carpet and dirty smudges in the front entrance area. For a 5-star hotel, I would expect better up-keeping than that.
- SEE THRU bathroom doors. Seriously? Do I need to see my friends take a pee?!
- Not so comfy beds. The sheets and pillows were nice but the bed was pretty firm\/hard. I was expecting a more luxurious bed. 
 
All in all, the Trump is a decent stay to stay if you don't mind hearing train sirens at 8 AM and being off the strip. I was hoping to give it a higher rating but unfortunately I didn't find the hotel that exceptional. For my next trip, I plan on staying on the strip so things are more accessible and I'm far away from the damned train.",0,0,0

I have to say, though, that being at a hotel that isn't part of the party-circuit, with no casino and no screaming drunk people was a relief.  We had a car, so we could drive everywhere.  Without a car, it is a schlepp.

Everyone who worked here was super-nice.  You have to flip an electronic switch if you want cleaning, and we didn't know that. Our cleaning lady (Hispanic--and not a rapist, murderer or drug-dealer, maybe Trump should actually meet some diverse people before he gives his next speech) kept an eye out for our return, to tell us they hadn't done the room because we hadn't hit the button, and to bring us extra towels and coffee.  That was so thoughtful!  We ordered room-service once, and they let us order things off the restaurant menu that weren't on the roomservice menu, and the delivery guy was so lovely, setting us a beautiful table by the window.  They also had a warming box, so things were delivered quite warm.  Unfortunately my omelet, which I asked them to cook lightly (""please don't overcook"") was very overcooked, and my friend's $6 bagels probably got their start in a Lenders bag.

The hotel is, on a surface-level, very luxurious.  I loved the quiet-calm of the lobby, especially after being in other hotels to see shows.  What a relief!  Unfortunately, our room, on the 58th floor, wasn't soundproof enough to keep the trains out of it, and I was woken up every night, around 4 in the morning.
That said, there's this weird discrepancy between the posh surface and the cheapness under the veneer.  There was stuff on the windowsill being held in place with plastic tape, labels that hadn't been completely removed from the sides of furniture (that you could only see from the tub) and a general sense of ethereality that made the veneer feel false.  The ""kitchenette"" had granite counter-tops and 2-element, flat stovetop, didn't include a single pan, knife, plate, or any instrument for cooking. (You can call housekeeping to request items, but who, really, is going to call?  It makes it almost impossible to cook because, say, you forget to ask for a ¼ teaspoon, and then have to wait for half an hour?) There was water damage inside the empty drawers.",2,1,1

    The hotel is off the strip, although if you pass through the mall is not a long trek to the strip. I mean you're in Vegas you'll be walking a ton no matter where you stay!
    The only down about the Trump is that the shuttle only takes you to Wynn and Ceasars. Wynn in right across the street, would be better if went to Mandalay or that area. 
                      Check in-
   We only had a 5 minute wait in line, even with a fairly full lobby. We arrived in Vegas rather early and as check in time isn't until 3 we had asked the gentleman at the desk if it were possible to check in early and he said "" sure thing!"" We were able to check in at 9 am get settled and have a full day in Vegas!
                    Room-
   People are complaint about the carpets! Let's just be realistic and remember this is a HUGE hotel and it takes a beating. The carpet in our room looked newer and well taken care of, the hallway carpets were clean but did show wear.
    Our room was clean and tidy. The rooms are HUGE. I liked the separate shower and beautiful deep jetted tub. The bed was extremely comfortable and they didn't jib us on pillows there were 6 on the bed and they are not the typical flat worthless pillows you generally get at other places.
   I've read a lot of reviews about foul smells we didn't have this issue other then the second day, I figured it was bc my husband left the toilet seat up over night. So we closed the lid after each use and the problem was fixed.
   Biggest shout out to the housekeeping here. These ladies are on point!! The first morning of our visit we quickly learned that 4 waters may not be enough and I asked our housekeeper if it were possible to get more, no hesitation or acting as if I were bothering her she grabbed about 8 bottles and brought them and put them in the fridge for us.

She immediately asked me to thank him for his 11 years of service and upgrade us to a 1bd corner suite.  She also stated she would make sure there was a special gift in the room for him as well.  Upon arrival the staff was courteous.  And when we walked in the room, they had a bottle of champagne on ice awaiting.  And I have to say the corner suite view was AMAZING.  There were 2 bathrooms, and the bathroom inside the bedroom was incredible.  The over sized spa tub, with the large glass door shower could make for quite the erotic scene (if you're not too much of a square :-) ).  The second bathroom was great because as a lady, I had my make and hair products everywhere, so this way the nice bathroom stayed free of my girlie products.  The bed was also very comfy.

We booked our room through priceline, which I didn't want to do, but they did had the cheaper option.  When I called in and asked if they can match the price or offer me something better the lady on the phone said ""we don't match priceline or travelocity"".  Well, okay I guess, but now you're missing out on a big cut, no? Anyways, I booked through PL  and upon arrival Yanet who was checking us into our room, offered us a 1 bedroom corner suite for 75 extra per night, my boyfriend was sold right away on the idea of a suite so we got it.  

The room was amazing, so huge and the bed was so comfortable.  I loved everything about the room, the bathroom was bigger than my bedroom and so luxurious.  

As others said you can hear the train, but honestly it wasn't a bother to me.  I slept all night and didn't hear it in my sleep and it only happened 3 or 4 times the entire day.

A few cons I had with the Trump was it was a little far from the strip, but there was a free shuttle that was available till 2am most nights which was great, we ended up using the taxi only twice on our 4 day trip.  

The room service 18% gratuity is complete BS.  If I'm ordering room service I'm obviously going to be tipping and the fact that you charge me beforehand to tip is just going to make me not tip more than I normally would have.  Another con about the room service is, yes, I understand it's going to be pricey, but 7 dollars for orange juice?  It's a glass or orange juice, it's not made out of gold guys.  I'm not a cheap person I clearly had a 5 star vacation, but squeezing out pennies from peoples pockets is just bad business. 

Also, as much as I loved the room I thought there was really random dumb mistakes, like we had a coffee machine with coffee, sugar, cream but no stirrer? Or we had conditioner, but no shampoo or body wash.  We had a huge Jacuzzi but no bubble bath products.  We had two bathrooms one had hand soap the other didn't. I think you get the idea.

When I was checking out on Monday the girl that was helping me out told me that I can't use my trump rewards card because I had booked through PL (Agoda) and I said yeah but I upgraded, in the end I spent 600 dollars just on the upgrade and room service.  Hyatt still honored my rewards card on extra charges even when I booked through PL.  Another thing the girl told me was next time if I book direct then I'd get to use my card and I told her I had called and the girl on the phone told me they won't price match and she was genuinely confused.  She said we normally would help you get a good deal with us directly maybe it was just bad luck.  

I know I listed more cons than pros, but it really was a great stay, the room was so luxurious.  It made us feel like we were on top of the world! I would recommend this hotel.",2,1,0

Checked in with a lovely red head at midnight.  Went up to our room.  I was very eager to get squared away and get some shut eye, only to find other peoples belongings still inside of our room!  A notebook, some change, lip balm, open soap in the bathroom.  Uhhh I don't think so, this cannot be our room.  Called the front desk from the room, waited for about 5 minutes for someone to pick up only to find out that we needed to be transferred to someone else and waited for another 5 minutes for that person to answer.  Explained the situation, and was told to come back to the lobby for an upgrade.  Krista? I believe, was very apologetic over the phone, met us at the front desk and got us an upgrade.  Excellent!  Went up to the 58th floor, one bedroom suite, strip view... NICE!   Only things were the x of the tic tac toe game was broken in half (better not charge us for an incidental) and no iron in the room.

Next morning tried calling concierge to get us some tickets and reservations.  Called about 3 times - phone kept ringing.  Went down to the concierge, ONE person at the concierge helping a group of people.  Ok this is going to take a while, we'll try again later!  Later came, same story ONE employee at the concierge desk already helping someone.  I booked my tickets myself, online and quickly.  Understaffed?!  I think so!  This hotel is VALET ONLY.  If that's so- please hire MORE VALET STAFF so we dont have to wait 10+ minutes for our car!!!  Also, valet staff sucks!  What ever happened to opening the doors for your guests?  Guess that goes out the window when you're understaffed.  That does not explain why we were waiting 15 minutes in our car for the valet only to see in the rear view mirror, valet guy servicing the car in back of us first!  ""Are you kidding me?"" were the words coming out of the hubby's mouth directed to the only valet working.  He opened his own door, mind you!  Valet guy said he was sorry (not really!)  - well there goes your tip buddy!  

Other than that, the hotel is really nice...ly decorated and for the most part clean.  They DO charge a resort fee that includes free wi-fi, $20\/night.  Room service was ok.  

I guess the bottom line is - we liked the Signature @ MGM better and probably wont stay at the Trump again unless its free.",3,0,1

Finally, one of their cleaning staff felt sorry and opened the door and told me not to tell anyone as he could get into trouble.  Another night I ordered six bottles of water with ice.

From checkin to checkout this was truly a 5 star experience. My wife and I stayed here 3 days for my birthday and checked in around 9AM with Ethel. She was excellent and accommodated us well with it being our first time staying there. She offered us some room upgrades at discounted prices but since it was only two of us and just wanted to experience staying here at the most basic level we declined. Even with no upgrades the room was beyond basic. She gave us a room with an excellent view and on a higher floor. We were facing the wynn and encore and still had a small view of the strip. Not a fan of Donald Trump but I appreciate any businessman who takes care of a paying client. The room had everything we needed for our stay: huge bathroom with a tv in the mirror, a relaxing jetted tub, huge shower, comfortable bed, kitchenette with a stove & tea kettle, a keurig, and a sub zero fridge. The hotel has valet parking only and a running shuttle that takes you to the wynn hotel and caesars palace on the strip until midnight during the week, all included in the resort fee. The valet team had great customer service each time we had to park or retrieve our car from the phone rep to the valet driver, and each time I called from the room the car was already pulled around by the time we were outside. The hotel is described as an off strip hotel but a 2 min walk around the corner you are on the strip. We were a bit leery at staying here in the beginning since our 1st vegas hotel experience was the Venetian but Trump by far surpasses the Venetian. You feel like everyone is here to serve your needs. Each time I called for any service from room to housekeeping the rep immediately greeted me by name and gave a followup call to ensure the service was delivered. The Trump hotel is truly an experience and customer service is top priority. We have found our new Vegas hotel. Kudos to the Trump family.",1,0,0

The room was much better than expected, nicely appointed and the decor was elegant and spacious. Hot water on demand, large shower and great water pressure. The staff was VERY helpful and courteous, a real plus. Only a couple of minor issues: train noise, shuttle convenience & DJT (their fine dining restaurant). First, I'm a heavy sleeper so the train wasn't an issue for me, we had a ""city view"" on the 39th floor. But for my girlfriend who is a light sleeper it awoke her several times a night. Second, the Trump is nice enough to provide a shuttle to both the Wynn and the Forum Shops at Ceasar's. The shuttle to the Wynn was easy but the one to Ceasar's was a bit of a hassle due to the demand and lack of organization. The shuttle would stop at different locations, the demand was high and people were taken onto the shuttle regardless of arrival time. Also, there is no access to the tram anywhere near Trump International. Lastly, we went to the DJT lounge for a cocktail Friday night. Elegant decor, nice atmosphere with the grave exception of a DJ playing loud music that was totally out of sync with the atmosphere and clientele. It actually caused us to choose a different restaurant for dinner and to leave early after one drink. Could hardly hear the waitress and visa versa. No dance floor but for some reason dance music. I like dance music at an after hours ""lounge,"" been to XS at the Wynn and had a great time but the classic elegance of DJT lounge and the pre-dinner hour timing was really questionable. Would have been great if they had a jazz trio or the like. Would I recommend the hotel, yes if you are aware of and ok with the things I've mentioned.

Trump sits directly behind the Fashion Show mall, so its an easy walk (2 blocks) to some inexpensive food and shopping.  Ivanka and her husband and baby were there while we were there.

Furniture is well beyond it's lifetime and desperately needs to be replaced. If this was a budget hotel, I wouldn't mind the nicks and scratches on the furniture, but when a hotel claims to be a 5 star ultra luxury hotel, these things are absolutely unacceptable. I seriously doubt that Donald Trump would ever live in such conditions. And one would think that the view would be nice from such a high rise building near the strip.

As anyone knows it's kind of silly to stay so near the strip but not on it.  It means you're taking cabs everywhere.  

Should you take the leap at least the Trump is smoke free and gambling free.  Not bad.

Certainly the hotel theme could be more interesting.  

I prefer the Wynn's beauty... if I must stay in a hotel with a rich guy's name all over it.  And Wynn isn't a known bigot or person that many consider fascist.  That's a valid concern.

First of all, you're in Vegas and you're there to play; it was extremely disappointing to learn that there was no casino in the hotel. What? Trump hotel just off strip and no casino?!? That was a big miss - I wouldn't have booked the place directly, but it's what we ended up getting via Priceline bidding. Anyway, so they have these shuttles to the Wynn and Ceasers to try to make up for it. It works pretty well during the day. The ride to the Wynn is super fast. It's literally a block away on a quiet street. The thing is, the shuttles don't run too late - well relative to Vegas-time.

The lady at the front desk when we checked in wasn't very pleasant. She did a heavy up-sell job on room upgrades. We ended up keeping the room we booked. I noticed it's a trend at these Vegas hotels, but there was this additional $25\/night resort fee we had to pay, which wasn't included in our original reservation. I wasn't completely surprised because I stayed a couple nights in another nearby hotel for a couple of nights before this one and they had it as well.

The room itself ended up being fine. It was spacious and had some nice features, like a TV in the bathroom mirror (not like that was practically useful). It was fine and the housekeepers were liberal with the bottled water, which was much appreciated.

I wouldn't stay at the hotel again, because you're paying near the high-end of the spectrum in terms of price, but you aren't getting the full Vegas experience without the  casino and so forth. I'm assuming they're trying to get approved for that as well, but I guess Trump should've played more nicely with Wynn in Atlantic City.

The location of the hotel was nice, a short walk away from the Wynn (do-able even in heels) and a quiet, casino-free getaway. Room service was fast and professional at 3am although they ran out of salsa for my quesadillas (??!!). At least the chicken wrap was tasty.

Two thumbs down to the hotel lobby staff we had to deal with who were rude, snippy, unprofesional liars who gave us serious and uncalled for attitude after we voiced our complaints and concerns. The pool was tiny and boring, the carpet was potentially dangerous (another maintanence person came to hammer down whatever was poking up), and the cheesecake was underwhelming.

I really like our room; very comfy, up on the 57th floor overlooking the Encore and Wynn and looking towards the Stratosphere; the bed was totally comfy; the kitchenette w\/fridge was handy; we each had our own lit closet; the bathroom was huge with a tv in the mirror.

This place was awesome and we would most definitely stay there again :)

BTW, I only heard the train whistle once, very muted, on only the first night.",2,0,0

The pros about the trump is that that the rooms are spacious and there's even a frig (cleared out to store all my alcohol) and a mini kitchen inside with a nice flat screen tv. The bathroom is awesome! Most girls spend more than half their time in the bathroom when it comes to Vegas so the huge bathroom was a plus. There is even a tv in the mirror and a spa bathtub. 

The trump is just a resort so there isn't a casino, that means no second hand smoke.  If you prefer more of a quiet atmosphere and the convenience of not having to cross a casino to get to the elevator to your room, this is a good option. If you like gambling, the drunkies and all the craziness that usually goes on in Vegas, this is not the place for you. Believe me, you will hate it. 

Now, onto the cons. The trump is slightly off strip. It's a stand alone resort across from the Wynn and the fashion mall. It takes about 10 minutes to walk to the Wynn which can be kind of annoying when you head out to a party late at night and back. The cool thing is that they have a driver at night to chauffeur you around without calling a taxi. I heard about the hotel smelling like flowers when you enter the lobby and it really does. Shit is strong! I was sick and had a stuffed up nose and was still able to take a whiff of that floral smell. Thank goodness that same smell wasn't in our room too! 

Overall, there arent too many cons at all besides the fact it takes 10 minutes to walk to where all the fun is. Thats just my laziness talking.",4,1,2

I went here for a bachlorette party and we were staying at the Trump. The check-in lady was stoked for our bride to be so we were given a complimentary upgrade to a suite! WOOT! 

Getting to the suit itself is pretty interesting... only because the elevator moves so freaking fast you get a headache. At least I did and the little rattles here and there catch me off guard every now and then. When you arrive to your door (at least at our suite) there's a door to get to your door and there are two doors. One is yours the other.. clearly not. They also have newspapers delivered every morning! Cool! And unwanted fliers too!

The suit itself is clean, its relatively up-to-date and its comfortable. The kitchenette here is also awesome as everything works pretty well and it comes with a pretty big fridge too! 

The bedrooms nice, clean and most importantly quite. The bed feels great and the air in the room is jusst right!

Your jetted spa tubs in the bathroom rocked my world. 
Thanks""

The rooms here at the Trump International Hotel are best described by my good friend ""A basic room at the Trump smokes most suites on the strip. Good job Donald"". That pretty much sums it up. This hotel is amazing. Actually really liked the fact that there is no casino. You still get the Vegas vibe, glitz and glam. 

No expense was spared in the hotel rooms. Full on kitchen with stove cooktop, sub-zero fridge and cookware if you felt like whipping up a meal. Really nice wall unit that serves as a closet as well. The Trump robes were soft and amazing. We were located on the 31st floor with a great view of the pool, Nordstroms across the street and the Wynn. The bathroom is what rocked my world. There is a TV screen in the mirror ! You can watch you favorite show while doing whatever you do in the bathroom. Hotness. The jetted spa bath tub was luxurious. I even brought my own bubble bath. 

The pool is nice at the Trump too. The pool service is really good, although there are no umbrellas to catch some shade. They do have cabanas but they are pretty spendy. 

The only bad mark I will give the hotel is the room service. I will admit we ordered at a very early hour (3am)...but it never showed up. Called at 4am and told them to cancel our order and they didn't even apologize. The last bad mark is the fact that we had late checkout at 4pm and when we went to our room at 3pm we were locked out and had to go downstairs so they could re-activate our room key. Not well organized on their part. 

Much more I can write about this fabulous hotel and I will end by saying , I would book myself another room here at the Trump next time we are in Vegas. Good times were had.",4,0,2

It's not cheap, but you do get a nice tv in living room with comfortable chairs that you can spread out and relax in, another tv in the bedroom which is connected along with the first to a dvr so you don't miss your shows while out enjoying Vegas.

We weren't sure about staying off the strip and were worried about how far we would be from everything. However, we were pleasantly surprised on every level.  

1. Location.  Even though the Trump is off the strip it is right across from the Wynn. Also, the Trump offers a shuttle to both the Wynn and Caesars Palace. When we did taxi to the Cosmo or MGM we didn't have to pay much for a taxi. 

2. Smoke free! Need I say it again...SMOKE FREE!!!! One of the worst things in Vegas, in my humble opinion, is the stinky gross smell. Not only do the hotel bars, lobby's, and rooms smell bad they leave everything that you bring into them smelling bad too. This is not a problem in the Trump.  

3. No Casinos. I thought this would bother me. However, it ended up being no big deal.  We ended up gambling before and after we went out every night in whatever hotel we were partying in.  The lack of casino made the hotel feel more welcoming at the end of each night.  

4. The Staff. Every interaction we had with anyone who worked here was great. Anthony, who checked us in and ensured we had the best room was awesome!! And the wonderful massage therapists who gave us the best massages ever were great too. Even our housekeeper was pleasant and helpful. Really, their staff was awesome.

The hotel ""selected"" for me was the Trump Tower.  Let me tell you, I will not be using Hotwire ever again.  Below is my experience.  And yes, Donald...YOUR FIRED!

Day 1
Requested and paid for an upgrade to one bedroom apartment.  Upon entering, the first thing we noticed was Ikea quality cabinetry and furniture.  There was a small, nicked up dining table and chairs.  One chair's leg was two inches shorter than the other three, so it wobbled to the point of being useless.

Large carpet stain by the entrance.

Day 2
Pressed the ""Do Not Disturb"" button.  That didn't do much good.  Housekeeping knocked on the door at about 10:00 AM.  

Ran water in the kitchen sink.  A foul smell seeped out from the drain.

Day 3
Pressed the ""Do Not Disturb"" button again.  Same results.  

My wife shampooed her hair.  No hair dryer.  Called the front desk requesting one.  15 minutes later, called again.  Finally, someone showed up.

Day 4
Tested and checked the ""Do Not Disturb"" light outside the room.  It wasn't working, so I pointed out the problem to housekeeping.  No one came by to fix it.

Day 5
Ran the sink water again.  Same foul smell.  This time I tried to run the garbage disposal, which didn't work.  I found the reset button on the bottom of the disposal unit and reset it.  Tried to run it, but it was jammed and tripped the circuit breaker again.

Went out for the day.  Came back at midnight.  Did NOT press the Do Not Disturb button.  This time, housekeeping didn't show up at all!  

Checkout day
The woman at the front desk asked if we had a nice stay and I told her that it was not nice at all and I informed her of everything that went wrong.  She then told me that had I reported these things, they would have been taken care of.  I replied that I had in fact let housekeeping know that the Do Not Disturb light did not work, and that didn't get fixed.  I also mentioned to her that she didn't write down anything that I just told her, so I doubt the hotel would do anything about the issues.

She then said she would see if the hotel manager would waive the $20 per day ""resort fee"" (nice hidden tax that isn't mentioned by Hotwire).  So after talking to the manager, she said he'd take of $50 from our bill.  At that point, I told her I would never be staying at a Trump property again, and she replied, ""Do you still want us to take off the $50?""

Here is a perfect example of the dialogue...I asked ""would I be able to get a side order of just walnuts in a cup?"" She responded ""We don't have walnuts, we can't do side orders"" I told her ""You did yesterday?"" She said "" what, are you just looking  a side of nuts?"" Hello? Anyway, looks like she was able to rustle some up, because the did appear with the order. I asked for kid's chocolate chip pancakes instead of the usual blueberry on the menu, like I did the morning before. Blueberry came instead. My husband went ahead and called back room service and spoke with her. She accused me of never ordering chocolate chip! Unbelievable. I cannot believe that an employee would be so rude working in this hotel. All other employees we had contact with were terrific! I would never noted this incident..but it was just so unbelievable..I had to. At check out, my husband also mentioned the incident. Perhaps Denny's would be a better fit for her?",0,0,0

I have heard great things about the Trump Hotel in Vegas and though I had absolutely no control over choosing the hotel (my boyfriend's father booked our rooms for us), I was so impressed by the hotel.

First and importantly, the location of the hotel is fantastic.  If you have been to Vegas before, and aren't necessarily dying to be smack-dab in the middle of all the craziness, the Trump is perfectly located.  It is literally a 3 minute walk to Fashion Show Mall (Nordies is across the street).  I want to say the hotel is set off the strip but that implies that it is actually off of the strip, which it is not.  It is slightly set back off the strip (meaning the hotel is not physically set on the property line adjoining the street) but it is absolutely walkable OR you can take the free shuttle across the street to the Encore\/Wynn.  

There is no gaming at the hotel, which at first bummed me out cause there is nothing more I love than playing craps long into the early hours of the morning.  However, the lack of gaming really contributed to the ambiance.  For starters, you don't have the drunk, loud, smoking gamblers partying all night long in the casino and causing problems.  Also, I noticed that the taxi cab line was WAAAAAY shorter than at most other casinos, which I attribute to the lack of competition with gamblers.  One cannot say enough about short taxi cab lines when you are trying to head out for the night and want your pre-party buzz to at least get you in the front door of the nightclub.  

THE ROOMS.  Our first night, we were in a studio. It was huge by any reasonable estimate and had a kitchenette.  We weren't there to cook in the room but if we were, the kitchen would have been fab to have.  We switched rooms for Saturday night because our rooms were booked through a 3rd party website and that's just how it was done (I am trying very inarticulately to convey that it was of no fault of the hotels that we switched rooms).  We ended up in a one bedroom room which was bigger than my apartment and had a full kitchen with full size range, oven, fridge and dishwater.  A gigantic bathroom and bedroom awaited and the room even had a guest bathroom with shower.  It was the perfect place for a weekend with the girls (or boys) and could accommodate at least 4 easily.  2 bathrooms makes it very easy to get ready for the night.  

I laid by the pool for a little while Sunday morning and noticed that the crowd was a little older (i.e. there were no 21 year olds that I could see) and ranged in age from about 25 to 50.   It was relaxing and mild compared to other Vegas hotels and perfect if you want to relax, feel fabulous but not listen to blaring techno music  and be trampled on my throes of people.  

All in all, the proximity to the shopping mall is the best.  The hotel itself is gorgeous and elegant and comfortable.  I am going back to Vegas in June for a bachelorette party and am super bummed that we aren't staying here.  If I only would have experienced the fabulousness sooner... Anyway, just another great excuse to head back to Vegas.",2,2,2

We wanted a suite that was spacious, but also within our price range. The Trump hotel was offering a Summer Sale discount for the rooms and it seemed like a good deal. I decided to book the Deluxe One Bedroom Suite which came out to $206.40 a night. This was the cheapest suite with good spacing that we could find, influencing our decision. 

Hotel: No casino, so the noise level is much quieter than other hotels. The lobby had a very classy feel. Valet parking is mandatory and complimentary. No charge, but be courteous and tip them when you leave! Wifi is also available, covered in the resort fee. 

Room: The 900-925 sqft suite included a fully equipped kitchen, master bedroom\/bathroom, large living room with a pull-out bed and another bathroom. The room was very modern, clean, and spacious. We were really impressed with the room.

Location: North of the strip across from the Fashion Show Mall. Since we were clubbing, we took taxi rides to get to the strip and back, ~$10-$15 a trip. It did seem like a far walk from the strip, so this can be a negative for those who like to just walk on the strip from place to place. 

Service: The people at the Check-In\/Out front desk and Valet were nice and gave us a welcoming greeting. However, we had an issue in which the pull-out mattress from the sofa did not pull out. We called room service to come check it out and it took them longer than anticipated to replace it. We weren't too happy about that, but otherwise we enjoyed good service. 

Overall, the Trump was a great hotel to stay in Vegas. The promotion gave us a relatively affordable room deal, so I will be on the lookout if they offer it again. Although I am interested in staying at the other many hotels in Vegas, I don't mind returning to the Trump if their room rates are cheaper compare to the other hotels.",2,0,1

I have had better experiences at the JW Marriott.
This place looks nice, but it kind of sucks. Our room was on the side adjacent to train tracks, so every 2 to 3 hours (all through the night) we heard the train whistle. NOT RELAXING.
I asked the woman that checked us in JANET, where I could get my nails done, for a wedding the next day. She insisted that she knew a few places and would leave a message on my phone. She NEVER did. I was forced to go to the spa. I tried the spa services, and was not happy either. I got a mani-pedi, and the gel nails came off within two weeks. I paid $ 162.00 for this. They included the gratuity of course, whether I liked it or not, I HAD to leave a tip.
The worse part came when I checked out. I forgot a pair of shoes in my room. Housekeeping was right outside as we where leaving so I figured that they would be in lost and found. I called back on Monday, and spoke to THE RUDEST security officer (Ofc. Holder), he told me that the ""Officer"" in charge of lost and found was off until Wednesday, so call back then. WHAT?!? He didn't even want to take a message or write down information or NOTHING. I was insistent that he at least put me through to her voicemail, which he begrudgingly did. I left two messages, and waited. On Wednesday, i called back, and after speaking to several other security officers, I finally got ahold of Ofc Green, who insisted that she had left me a message. When I pressed her to confirm the number that she had called back, she had transposed the numbers and left the message on someone else's VM. She said she would call me the following day. It has now been 1 1.2 weeks, and I have not heard a word from them.
The hospitality business, is ALL ABOUT good customer service. The Trump Las Vegas, is lacking.
The only reason I am giving it 2 stars, is because the room was pretty. But pretty does not outshine bad customer service.",3,0,0

When the trump tower showed up on Hotwire for $100 less than we were paying at TI, I had to jump on it!

Checkin: Because of their stupid no self parking allowed policy, we did have to wait 15+ minutes for valet. This was probably just because of NYE though. Line to check in was fairly long as well.. but no worries, the staff gave us all champagne to sip while we waited, so I consider my 5 minutes in line well spent when I'm given champagne to drink!

Room: We stayed in basically the crappiest room in the place. A studio (vs a 1,2+ bedroom suite), and on almost the lowest floor (floor 18, number starts at 17). Despite this, this room was one of the best I've stayed in in Vegas (and I've stayed in most of them!). The view while non-strip was still good - a side view of the Treasure Island and mountains, etc. The amenities were amazing! Full kitchen (awesome fridge, blender, toaster, Le Creuset kettle), HUGE tub with jets (one of the biggest jet tubs I've had in Vegas), really comfy bed, and gourgues knick-knacks and decor that made the place feel like a million bucks rather than cheesy. 

While Trump is an ego maniac (for instance he sells his Vodka for $25 more per bottle than Grey Goose... really Mr Trump, your Vodka is better than Grey Goose?), and I've always been turned off by the gaudy gold exterior.. I have to admit, this guy knows how to do luxury right! I can't complain about one thing. 

Look for this place on Hotwire.. under the 5 star category. It's the only 5 star on center strip with a kitchenette (so you'll know it's the Trump!). You can score some killer deals on this place.",8,3,2

decided to try the 3 course meal in the hotel, and stopped for a drink in the lobby before the restaurant opened. there were people at the bar, and in the lobby, but it was not busy. bar waiter had to be the worst waiter in the world. he came to help us pretty quick, but was clueless on what tequilas they had. i then told him what i wanted, my friend ordered vodka on the rocks, and after almot 10 minutes and no drinks, we gave up. he then greeted us in the restarant, where we told him to bring the drinks to our table. great restaurant waiter, but even he had no answer to why we didn't have drinks. he came back then said the bar is busy...we could see the bar, very quiet. drinks took close to 25 minutes. great meal in the restaurant.
took the complimentary shuttle to the wynn. we got into an almost full shuttle (one seat left). the driver ran off saying he'd be right back. after an eternity, another person in the van got out and requested some help from the valets. a driver jumped in immediately and apologized for the driver..change of shifts....ok, but to leave a full van of people sitting for over 10 minutes.
at then end of the night, we came to our room, and the fold out was not made up, as requested when we first checked in. it took 3 calls to get the bed made up....and then it was the worst mattress ever. i had just stayed at a place in chicago that had an infaltable matress in the fold out bed....that was a good bed. this was probably the cheapest fold out couch i have seen in a long time.

Perhaps it's Mr. Trump's race for the White House that has the prices so steep in comparison to its rivals, or perhaps it's just the location that has the prices down, whatever the case - these rooms were a steal! Combined with free valet parking, things weren't too bad.

The rooms were nicely laid out, furnished, and complete with a kitchen, hugeeeee (said in Mr. Trump's voice) bathroom, and overall, a nice stay. The few things that can be said for improvements come in the form of slow check-in\/check-out service at the front counter, and slow valet service.

I always associate him with that tacky and ostentatious shiny gold motif, which the hotel def has from the exterior. Once I went inside though, it was all good. First off, the place smells heavenly. I love that they really thought about that detail; it is so commonly overlooked. They must pump the perfume in through the air ducts but it really is fabulous. Kudos for that. The lobby is not very large and the bar\/lounge is minimal but very nice. They have a great piano player. Drinks were good. Staff is very professional. 
The room we stayed in was incredible. Not only was it very affordable but it was the smallest size room they offer at the hotel and it was still double the size of most hotel rooms you come across. The decor was modern, clean and masculine. I absolutely loved it, as did my husband. 
So, why not a 5 star review? Well, the devil is in the details. Valet took way too long and was chaotic. I also didn't like the fact that I could not self-park. I was charged a bogus $15 ""resort fee"", the gym was $22 a day, Internet was $12. The modest breakfast of egg whites and vegetables cost me about $25 when all was said and done. So, although the price for the room itself seems reasonable, you will end up paying quite a bit more if you want to use all the amenities that the hotel offers. It's still an ok deal considering the quality of the hotel but it's not the great deal you think you are getting. Nonetheless, I'll be staying at the Trump again.

I arrived at 11am for meetings and we pleasantly surprised when they let me check into my room that early. Awesome! There is no casino, but there is a beautiful bar and restaurant on the main level.

During our stay, we did not see or hear anything disruptive...no riff raff, no room parties, no streakers, no screamers, no drunks, etc.  Security is very good here and they will ask you to show your room key before they let you go to the elevator area.

The hotel staff were very friendly, helpful and service oriented.  There is a $29.00 resort fee, but there is complimentary valet parking.  No fees for parking is a plus as most people know resort fees and parking fees could easily add up.  Complimentary bottled water is also provided.  The bar and restaurant area is small, but it was fine for us and we thought the food was good.  In Vegas, there is no shortage of food options.  There is a complimentary shuttle that runs every 15-20 minutes to Wynn and Caesar's Palace.

The hotel is right across the street from the mall, which was a huge plus for us.  There are plenty of good restaurants (Maggiano's, Capital Grille, Sugar Factory, etc) within walking distance and if it's too hot, cold, windy or rainy, you can walk through the mall to get to these places.  

The rooms are very clean and spacious.  We stayed in the Superior One Bedroom and it was about 900 sq ft.  There is a dining area, living room (couch is a queen size sofa sleeper), kitchen with full size appliances, 2 bathrooms with showers, king size bed, large flat screen TV's and plenty of storage.  One thing about the kitchen...they are not kept fully stocked, so you will need to ask for the items you need.  I think it is due to some city regulation. 

Your motivations for coming to Vegas will determine if the Trump Hotel is an appropriate choice.  If you are looking for an active party atmosphere, shows, casinos, smoking, night life, a different hotel might be a better choice.  If you want to sleep at night and are looking for a quiet, clean atmosphere for yourself and your family (especially if you have young children), Trump Hotel is the place.  Once or twice during the night\/morning you might hear the train whistle, but it's minor and beats hearing drunks partying through the night.

The horn was loud enough to wake me up. I am light sleeper, but if you are sleeping at a 5 star hotel, on one of the top 5 floors you don't expect to hear outside noise.

The main thing that disappointed me was their customer service. When I complained regarding the same to their staff, the lady at the front desk told me that they could not move me since they were at capacity. She tried to prove to me that I was far away from the railway line and that I should not be hearing the train nor the pool music at all. She acted unapologetic and condescending and offered to send over ear plugs; couldn't stop stressing that they were going to be free of cost like she was doing me a big favor. Funny thing after all that, the ear plugs were never delivered.

We demanded help.  Eventually, an hour later, a chamber maid, the second one, said she saw one in another room and went and got it for us.  We tipped her highly.  Mr. Trump you should of tipped her not us.  We tipped her for making up for what your hotel did not do.  

No way will we come back again.

She had been to Vegas couple times and I went to school here so I conceder myself a local. Have been too been to several hotels around town and the Trump is by FAR the best in Vegas

To start, the Trump is reasonably prices (for a 5 star) the guest services are very nice and treat you well as you come in the door. The Lobby is clean, well laid out and beautifully appointed. Big plus for me was that this hotel does not try and nickel and dime you, Internet, paper, pool and much more are part of the room fee.  Hell I have seen hotels try and charge you bottled water but not here.

All rooms as suites and we got the city view which is what really made the stay the best. So here is the break down

PROs:
1.) Clean and beautifully done hotel 
2.) Friendly Staff who are quick to respond to each request and with a smile
3.) Great rooms with stocked kitchen (for 2)
4.) Great Views
5.) One if the best beds I have ""slept"" on. 
6.) Huge\/ deep jet Tub
7.) TV in the Bathroom mirror (Basically a bathroom you want to hang out in )
8.) Pool is great and again staff is helpful. 

CONs:
1.) TV sucks, (Freezes, delay in channel change limited channels) Then again who goes to Vegas to watch to TV!!
2.) Train noise is unavoidable, no matter what room you are in you will hear it. I think it just blends with the city noise.

Final: Not only will we be coming back, but this makes us want to travel to the other hotels in the chain.",2,0,0

We used priceline.com to purchase the hotel rooms. Considering that the Memorial Day weekend is expensive, the Trump Hotel had reasonable costs. 

I really like the suite! The mini fridge, stove, and the safe box gave nice touches to the room. It was also impressive to see a TV in the bathroom. The bed was extremely comfortable. I didn't want to get out of bed in the mornings.

The $20\/night resort fee is a bit high since you get 2 bottles of water, free wifi internet access, complimentary valet parking, and a couple other amenities. If you are using valet, just allot yourself and additional 10-15 minutes to receive your car during the busy times. 

The hotel isn't that far from the main strip area, but you do need to walk. We just went through the Fashion Show Mall and other hotels to get to the main attractions on the Strip.

I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone. The hotel is 2-3 years old, and has great customer service.",0,0,1

The rooms are very spacious and nicely decorated. The king size beds are very comfortable. I loved the double sinks in the bathroom and the jacuzzi tub. The bathrooms also have a separate shower and toilet.

Room service is polite and efficient. And to is guests services; having lost our room key several times, they were very nice about bringing one up or making us a new one.  

My one complaint about The Trump is that cell phone reception is nonexistent! There were 6 of us on 2 different floors and all different networks and no one had reception. I don't know how this is possible in 2014. That's the only reason we won't be returning to this hotel.",1,0,0

But when you classify yourself as a ""five star"" resort, my expectations rise right along with your rating.

The good:
* I booked on Priceline under ""name your price"" for $105 and was accepted.  This was during Spring Break, so it was a great deal.
* location is right across the street from the mall & Nordstrom.  If you like to shop, you will love the location.
* NO CASINO, therefore quiet and relaxing.
* Spectacular views from the higher floors.  We were in room 5616 & while it faced the ""old town"" side of the Strip, it was nonetheless spectacular. 
* complimentary valet parking.  You may have to wait 5-10 min, but it's well worth the wait.
* microwave, mini fridge, built in hot plate, & sink make it super easy to have a wide variety of snacks & drinks in the room.  Anyone with kids will surely understand this!!  :)
* huge bathroom with shower & juccuzi tub.
* complimentary shuttle to & from Caesars Palace & the Mirage (not sure if it's the Mirage or another hotel.....) every 15 min.  Very convenient feature.
* Yoga @ 9:00 for $12.00
* great gym
* express elevators with three separate areas servicing certain floors
* TV in the bathroom mirror
* friendly & efficient front desk staff
* complimentary water & Starbucks coffee in room daily.
* extremely comfortable king sized bed.
* If you are older and\/or have any type of issue that makes walking great distances an issue, this is the hotel for you!  You pull your car up to the front doors & literally walk for 3-4 minutes to the elevators to your room.  Door to door in less than 10 minutes..... And maybe even less.  This is a huge plus and so much more peaceful than schlepping through a huge, loud, smoky casino.


The Bad:
* the room was dusty
* the pull out couch was miserably uncomfortable with springs popping through.  They need to be replaced.
* the pool had trash in it.  Granted it was windy, but it was still gross.
* $25.00 ""resort fee"" that was never really discussed until I asked.
* the desk was all stained & damaged
* the window vent was broken & constantly made loud noise
* the carpet was kind of nasty 
* I had to call down for bedding for the extra bedding for the couch & wait 20+ minutes to get it.  This should have been in the room.
* freight train noise every morning..... Early morning...... All morning long.

I honestly enjoyed my stay.  However, I would not rate this as a five-star experience at all.  This hotel is 3 1\/2- 4 stars at best.",2,0,0

I like nice hotels and comfy beds and service with a smile but in the same turn pretty low mantainence.  With that said, I stayed at the ""new"" Trump Hotel in Las Vegas (which I visit about 3-4 times a year) September 25-27, 2009

Having stayed at many 4 and 5-star hotels I've become quite familiar with the type of services that should be included or give an added touch.  While the Trump great decor and incredibly fast room service, I think they have some kinks to work out before being given a 5-star rating.

Cons: 
1. though central, the hotel is pretty isolated
2. The pool is incredibly small as is the surrounding pool area
3. No food or drink was allowed at the pool area - WHAT?!
4. The work out room was incredibly small (though had some good machines)
5. No dvd player
6. Minimal dishes, no pots and pans
7. they don't have tea with the in-room coffee - you have to ORDER it with a fat service charge from room service
8. decor was nice but very ""cold""
9. turn down service for the pull-out never came
10. Doors were heavy and often slammed - which is a pain considering you share a suite enterance with your neighbor
11. Signage to find your way around (like restrooms) need to be re-evaluated
12. hotel bar was incredibly small ESPECIALLY since there is no casino
13. No in-suite bar (snacks, drinks etc.)

It felt like a retirement home vs. a luxury stay in Vegas.  Next time I will keep make another reservation at the Signature.

Pros: it was pretty quiet - - no drunkin' ""just turned 21"" year olds running around.  Room service was quick but the food was ""ok"" (did the trick for midnight munchies but cost $60 :) The Lobby Decor is pretty exceptional.",1,1,2

The double doors to get to your room help make it extra quiet, and you do not hear one door slam during the morning, (if you have been to a lot of hotels, you know how loud that can be--brutal!) 

The one down side that many are mentioning is the sound of the train in the middle of the night\/early morning waking them up. I was woken up too at 5:30am from the train passing by, but I was dead tired that it did not bug me too much and I was off to sleep again in no time!

The room was very large, and I could have just stayed here all day and ordered room service and I would have been the happiest gal ever!

The bed and pillows were amazing and I sunk right into them. This being a 5 star hotel, there were plenty of upgrade in the room like a tv on the bathroom mirror, Jacuzzi tub, full bar\/kitchen, STARBUCKS coffee to brew in the morning, and 3 music stations to choose from to make your stay even more relaxing. 

The room service menu was not as expensive as other 5 star hotels. We were tempted to order but we opted to eat on the strip so I cannot tell you about the food, but it looked great on the menu.

The lobby is elegant, and absolutely beautiful. It is lightly perfumed and no smoking--Yahoo!

It's a little off the strip but they have a shuttle to the Wynn & Caeser's Palace that runs until midnight and you can cut through the mall across the street to get to Las Vegas Blvd. when they're open.

Staying here allowed my girlfriend and I to be able to escape the commotion of Vegas at two very important times of the day - first thing in the morning and later at night when we just wanted to sleep without loud noise, bright lights and the wonderful aroma of stale tobacco - none of which to be found here!

They gave us two bottles of water daily and had coffee in the rooms (also replenished daily). The small refrigerator, stove, sink, microwave, glasses, paper towels, mugs, silverware, dishes, drink mixer, closet space, small couch, coffee table and desk area gave the room more of an apartment feeling. The king size bed was also very comfortable - didn't sleep on the pullout so I can't say how that was. The fitness room is above average for a hotel and the pool area is nice but I refuse to pay $75 for a cushioned pool chair with pillows that can fit two.

The room was nice but could use a better dusting job. When we got there, our toilet wouldn't flush but they came and fixed it right away. The only real problem was that we had a problem with our door lock \/ handle which was fixed after a couple of complaints. As a result, the manager was very apologetic and refunded the resort fee which was nice. The bar, in-room dining menu and spa are pricey so we didn't indulge in any of that - the best way Trump seems to live up to his name is with prices.

All in all, I would recommend this hotel and would stay here again.",0,0,0

Pros:
- no cigarette smell
- crazy nice rooms that are actually condos that have a kitchen!

Cons:
- no casino
- somewhat off strip but easy walk to the strip

My experience was overall really positive.  The lobby is blinging with all the crystal chandeliers and smells like flowers everytime you walk in.  SUPER GREAT front desk service who upgraded my room to a 1 bedroom suite!  

The actual room was probably the nicest room I've ever stayed in.  Clean and modern furnishings.  The kitchen had a stove, microwave, dishwasher, and oven!  I didn't actually see anything to cook with besides a tea kettle (pots, pans, cooking utencils) so if you're planning on putting the kitchen to full use you might have to supply your own stuff.  In a one-bedroom suite there are two bathrooms!  The vanity in the master bath was definately put to good use and the jetted tub was awesome after a night of partying.  I definately appreciated all the little details.  A light turned on when you opened a closet door, the insane amount of towels in the bathroom, and complimentary water bottles that were restocked everyday.  

There is a daily resort fee but I didn't take advantage of any of the amenities (heated pool, gym, etc).

Upon arrival I had no hangers, one bathroom faucet wasn't working, both wardrobe\/closet lights were broken, and the clock-radio was simply missing.  When a clock-radio was finally delivered, it had no antenna, so I gave up on music.  The towels were also very hard and scratchy.  I was also disappointed to find that this hotel is not actually ""on"" the strip but rather almost a full block off (misleading), and too far to walk when it is very hot outside.  There is only 1 true restaurant in the hotel, plus a tiny disappointing cafe by the pool.  And when I asked the concierge where I could enjoy breakfast outside, I was told nowhere.  I was told that you cannot take food and drink to the pool area!  Unheard of!  I was told I could go get my food at the bar and take it to the sundeck...which turns out to be a barren concrete area with no tables or shade (or people).

A True 5 star experience. As soon as you enter the hotel, you know that it's a beautiful place. Our check-in was very smooth (11 pm). Paul at the front desk offered us a complimentary upgrade. I was delighted to know that we got a one bedroom suite. We loved the strip view. The rooms were clean and beautiful. The bathrooms were nice. The beds were comfortable and the best part was the staff.
However, I think they should offer self-park services. I didn't have any issues with the Valet parking, but, sometimes I thought I can use self-park. The TV in the bathroom mirror was great. The LG TVs in the bedroom\/family room could use an upgrade.
There are no casinos in the hotel, but We are no big gamblers. We really liked the fact that we didn't have to walk through the casino to go to our room.
We stayed in room 5926 (59th floor), and I loved the experience.
I realize that the hotel is one block off the strip. But, we had a rental car, so we didn't have any issues. Also, the hotel offers a complimentary shuttle to Wynn & Cesears Palace every 15 minutes.

The room is perfect, very well-appointed and luxurious.  However, our room faces away from the strip and there is a train track that runs one block away, all day and night, and it is really loud.  This hotel seems to have no insulation because we can hear the highway and the train at all hours, helicopters flying by, etc.  So it's like a dichotomy here, of absolute luxury tempered with Motel 6-like noise level.  At this very second I can hear a helicopter going by.  When the trains roll through blowing its horn, you almost have to stop talking and wait for it to go by before resuming. 
The staff here couldn't be nicer though, and the room is gorgeous.  I would prefer to be able to walk more easily to the strip or wherever, but the heavy traffic on Fashion Show Road makes that difficult.  Valet parking-only makes it necessary to wait, and tip, every time you need your car brought around too.

We were coming here for my dad's birthday and wanted him to show him what Vegas was all about as he had not been there for 5+ years.

There were even two full bathrooms, one of which the showers could have fit 2 people.  The bathroom was absolutely gorgeous and decorated with a modern touch.  There were 2 flat screen TVs and a table we used for eating and drinking, as well as a little kitchen and full-sized refrigerator.  This room was perfect for pre-partying and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves here.  The pool was average.  The pool itself was very hot and was heated like a hot tub almost, so it wasn't very refreshing to be in on a hot day.

Its new and the accommodations are nice but its not happening at all. In fact, if someone kidnapped you and took you to a room there or even the lobby you would have no idea that you're in Vegas, no casino, no noise, no people, no bling, nothing. Even the average age of the guests here is older. I do not recommend this hotel because I don't think it encompasses Vegas unless you are here for business and you need a nice hotel to stay at that's quiet. 

Additionally, I would like to mention that this wasn't a huge deal because the actual price of this hotel was only 15% more than what I bid. Again all the other hotels rated 5 star were $300 + but I don't know if this is really 5 star. 

Also, its not on the strip, yes its a short walk to the strip but its not on it. so no matter where you are your view is slightly retarded. The pool was dead.

However this is not the hotel that I would recommend.  My understanding is that the hotel is a financial flop -- gaming license rejected, real estate market crushed plans for more towers and time share sales.

Thus, the hotel is left with an insufficient budget. 

Don't expect to get any form of accommodations from this hotel.  I suspect that the staff was not able to get jobs at the true 4-star hotels.  The clientele is low-class.

My experience included a drunk guest who rang the door bell to my suite at 3:00 a.m. claiming that his girlfriend was in my room.  After having to physically escort him to the front desk, he returned to my room less than 15 minutes later looking for his girlfriend again.  After a brief scuffle and again escorting the drunk guest to the front desk, I was greeted by 2 security thugs at my room accusing me of ""beating up"" another guest.

The next day, my son and I fell ill to food poisoning (no kidding...you can't make this stuff up!)  I suspect is was from the previous night's room service.

Even the toilet paper was folded in little points.  It was just a fantastic experience.  

I had requested champagne and roses in the room upon arrival, but they were not.  When I called the conceirge, they were brought to our room within 10 minutes, $100 comped to the room and an order of chocolate covered strawberries were sent up (on the house) after dinner.  It was just a really thoughtful and I really appreciated that everyone was so friendly.

True, it is located a bit further down the strip than some of the others, but to get away from the smoke and gambling, I thought it was perfect.

And then there was the spa.  Oh the spa.  It was heaven!  I could not have asked for a more amazing therapist than Roxanne.  She gave me probably the best massage I've ever had.  My husband and I got a couples hot stone massage and it was so relaxing and absolutely perfect.

There was a pseudo-kitchen with an electric stove-top, microwave, mini-fridge, and even a toaster. The king-size bed was super comfortable from the pillows to the mattress and linens. Free complimentary coffee and two bottles of water. Double sinks in the bathroom. There was even a freakin' jacuzzi in the bathroom! Don't forget the super soft bathrobes.

We get there, and there are about 30+ people waiting in line for check-in, yet there are only THREE front desk people working. However, there were over eight concierge standing at their booths doing nothing--NOBODY needed their help at the moment. PLEASE tell me how this makes sense.

We waited in line for about 45 minutes until we finally were able to check in. Many were very irritated and we heard people saying never again. 
I come to Vegas every other month and have stayed at many hotels, and check in usually takes no more than 10 minutes.

Finally get to the room and it's beautiful. Arrived there at night so we headed out and didn't stay much until we came back to crash.
Time for check out the next day and we call the front desk at 10:30 AM to let them know that the jacuzzi AND showers aren't working. They tell us they'll send someone to fix it ASAP and change our checkout time to noon. 

Engineering and maintenance arrive AN HOUR later and finish fixing the showers at 11:40. Apparently this has been broken for a while and they never finished working on it, according to the engineers. Jacuzzi isn't fixed. 20 minutes for TWO people to shower and get ready? REALLY? I had to WASH MY HAIR IN THE SINK. 

This was FREAKING ludicrous. I've never paid so much for a hotel and was treated like crap. The best they could do was take off the resort fee. 

Really? $30 off for a hotel that I paid over $200 for just so I can shower in the FLIPPING SINK???? 

VERY disappointed and do NOT recommend. 
Oh, and of course check out took 40 minutes as well. I would have done check out from the room but I had to speak to front desk... Which turned out to be useless.

It's now almost 2 weeks and after many phone calls to the security team as well as the front counter managers - the rental company and us have left a number of messages and asked for conformation that someone will confirm they are looking into the issue - NO reply! The security team is rude and every time we call, there is no one there who can tell us anything. The front desk managers are friendly but useless!

I recently stayed here for an extended trip and the Trump Hotel served as my ""home away from home"" for quite some time. I stayed in a one-bedroom corner suite with a strip view on the 44th floor and it's definitely better than the standard suites and one-bedroom suites because it's more spacious and it has a magnificent view of the strip. Just a note, make sure to request a room that is closer to the Encore hotel, if you are staying on the other side near Industrial Road you will be hearing the extremely loud train horns throughout the night! Overall I was very satisfied with my stay here, except for the 19.99 resort fee (per day) that definitely adds up when you calculate that into your daily rate. One of the major pluses is that they allow small dogs here. I brought my dog Harvey along and he was treated like royalty! They do charge a $200 pet fee per stay but they waived $100 off without my asking. That's cheaper than most hotels charge for pets and in my opinion is very reasonable. The charge also includes a memory foam pet bed and a fancy water and food dish set that your furry friend gets to take home. They also have a designated area right outside the hotel for bathroom breaks for the furry ones. 

As for the room itself, it was very spacious and clean. There's a separate entrance for each room away from the hallway, making this one of the quietest hotel rooms I've ever stayed in. My corner suite room included a living room and separate bedroom. It also comes with a full kitchen with all the goodies: stove, refrigerator, sink, microwave, dishwasher, etc. There are two bathrooms, which both have showers. All the rooms have one king size bed only so if you have extra people staying in the room they'll have to sleep on the sofabed in the living room, which didn't look too comfortable. My favorite though had to be the bathroom! It was HUGE!!! It was probably equal to the size of the bedroom and had a separate area for the toilet and the shower and everything was mainly marble. There is also a large jacuzzi with a large window overlooking the strip. I loved the tv in the mirror!! It was so fun getting ready and watching tv at the same time.

The staff here was amazing. I've read many complaints about housekeeping but I had no such problems, in fact my experience was just the opposite. Our housekeeper came by everyday, even when we didn't light the housekeeping green light to see if we needed our room cleaned. She was so sweet and very diligent and always made our room spotless. Along with her, the other employee that really stood out to me was Lamont. He's the doorman out front and was always so helpful and every time I ran into him he would strike up a conversation with me and always remembered our names! More hotels need to hire great staff like that! Parking is valet only. It's also right across from the Fashion Show Mall and a very short 5-minute walk to the strip. I will definitely stay here again, especially if Harvey comes along again.",3,1,1

Just came back from Vegas in Sept.  Brought a 2 night stay here for the 1st time as a Expedia ""Mystery"" Hotel.   Actually we already knew we are going to get Trump, coz there isn't any 5 star, smoke-free, casino-free on the North end of the strip.  

Location is  1\/2 a block off N end of the strip, right next to the Fashion Show Mall.  If you are young or fit enough, you can get take a short walk thru the mall (while enjoying the air cond and shops) to get the strip in just 5mins for a brisk walk, or 8mins for a casual walk.  Free complimentary air cond shuttles are available (actually it is covered under your mandatory daily resort fee) every 15mins to & from Trump, Caesar Palace and Wynn.  The last shuttle is at 12 midnight, but even a 10min walk from the LV blvd (strip) was not nearly as bad.

Pros:
- For a starter, your body and your clothes won't come back smoke-infused (unless you have submerged yourself in other smoky hotels for the whole day).  At the lobby, you will greeted with fresh air and be free from the noise of drunk youngsters and gamblers, and from the in-famous slot machines.  
- Checkout is easy and fast.  They call your room the day before to remind you the 3 ways to checkout: front desk, by phone or by TV.  We checked out via TV.  Took less than a minute.
- Energy saving: they replace almost all spot & flood light with CFL, which I don't mind for the sake of conserving for the planet and becoz they use warm colored CFL (not cool white thanks god) without making you look like a ghost. Just press the Home Service button on daily before you leave, the maid will service the room.
- Our room is a Basic room on the 50th floor.  Not sure if Trump has changed their doors, but we hadn't experienced any noise from our neighbor closing the doors.
- Clean room.  Comfy bed.  Even basic rooms are well equipped.  Floor to ceiling window, built-in stove, microwave, mini sink, fridge (great for biz trip & family.  Just heat up a hot breakfast in the morning on the go; call room service to get utensils and coffee pot for free), coffee maker, daily refill coffee, tea & 2 bottled waters for free, bathrobes, jacuzzi, walkin shower, builtin tv washroom mirror, reasonably large rm LCD, vanity mirror, hair dryer, shutout light blinds, spacious washroom. The toilet is partially enclosed off so any particular smell won't be spread to the rest of the washroom.

Cons:
- An expensive stay, even at discount.
- Contemporary décor & interior design.  Expecting a 5 star hotel basic room to be have impressive decors & interior design.  Not a single interior design element in the entire hotel is extraordinary IMHO.  But would say their design is shooting for a clean, elegant, executive, contemporary look as supposed to over the top vegas extravaganza.
- Not a big property compared to other hotels on the strip.  Relatively small pool by Vegas standard.  ""Restaurants"" in the lobby area are pretty much for people watching (or for ppl watching you eating your food).
- Check in: don't know if it was Expedia's or Trump's fault.  For some reasons they had our booking reference # but not our names on file, which caused kink in the ID verification at checkin.  Ended up waiting for 20mins until they sorted out the deal and apologized again for our inconvenience.  But overall I would say their front desk staff are polite, friendly and representable.
- Weak shower pressure even on the 50th floor.  Water was not HOT HOT at max setting but good enough to generate ample steam. May be it is 1 of their ways to preserve and be cost-effective.
- Weakness in maintenance: given the young age of the hotel, it has already started to show some signs of premature wear & tear.  Trump will not be too pleased.  The shower temp control had pieces falling off.  The showerhead was broken for other pressure settings.  Broken light bulb in the vanity mirror had not been replaced.  Toilet cover was loosen. We had to screw it back to make it stay.  
- Heavy glass door inside the washroom:  walkin shower and the toilet are thoughtfully individually enclosed, but the doors are too heavy that it bang too hard if you don't close them carefully enough.

Nice hotel.  Would stay here again, at a discount of course.",0,0,0

Paid $140 on priceline for a room right after Christmas. Yeah, it's a nice hotel for $140, but not quite 5 stars. Here's the lowdown:

PROS
1. No casino, no smoking. Nice if you got kids
2. Food at restaurant was pretty good. Amazing room service pancakes, super fresh at 1am!
3. Clean and spacious rooms, comfortable beds;  
4. Free shuttle to Caesar's (when running on time)

CONS
1. Valet service takes awhile. Valet is included in $25 resort fee but there's no self park option (unless you park at Nordstrom's across the way). Sometimes its nice to have that
2. $25 resort fee. Cmon, now
3. Bag check took at least 20 mins to get our bags delivered when we checked in. Granted, we forgot an item in the car that we asked them to bring, but it wasn't crowded when we arrived and there were plenty of staff around. Hence, why self park is nice sometimes
4. Can't really walk to strip. Yes its close, but the sidewalk ends headed towards the Wynn and we stepped over a homeless man getting there. Free shuttle didn't run on time we found so would have been better to taxi it, then wait 15 minutes for shuttle that didn't come, and then taxi it.",6,0,1

Staying here after being away for 18 months, I can definitely say things have gone downhill.  There is noticeable wear and tear everywhere.

The hotel is not on the strip as reported by Priceline.  It is, however, directly in front of a multitude of seedy establishments including strip clubs so I can see the potential for confusion there.  The geographic location of the hotel is a tremendous benefit if you enjoy the frequent sounds of police sirens at any given hour.

Speaking of sounds....let me tell you how my roommates and I laughed at 4:30 AM when the train repeatedly blew it's whistle as it passed into town.  It was obnoxious albeit, hilarious.  This is a daily event.

Beware the 'resort fee'!  As a rule I do not mind paying for things when I know what I am getting.  When I had to sign a piece of paper saying I understood the mandatory $15 per day resort fee, I was told it covered items like my newspaper and valet.  When I mentioned to the gentleman at the desk that I did not need the newspaper, nor did I have a car that would require use of the valet, his response was just, ""It's mandatory"".

Not only was the fee mandatory, but since I had booked through Priceline, they would not let me cancel my reservation to take my business elsewhere.  I could care less about the $15 per day fee but I know it doesn't cover the newspaper which they advertise as being complimentary and I know it doesn't cover valet parking which I read was $14 per day.  So what the hell is it for?

Internet fee $12 per day.  Seriously!  Even the two complimentary waters we were given did not take away the shock of that cost considering almost everywhere else we went offered free wifi.

The room itself was, for appearances sake, very pleasant.  The king sized bed was very plush and comfortable.  There was no shortage of pillows and the spread was very soft and cozy.  The pull-out couch, however, was a disgrace.  Pity the friend you bring along that gets to sleep on the sofa bed.  The mattress was thin, uncomfortable and unappealing, even after several drinks...ask my roommate!

Despite all of that, the bathroom was luxurious.  I took a shower right after I settled in just to test it out.  I was a little disappointed that I forgot conditioner and decided to use the hotel's conditioner instead.  After all, it was right beside me in the shower.....  It left my hair feeling HORRIBLE!  So I get out of the shower disapoointed again and cross to the sink to use my 'complimentary' lotion.  Weird lotion that my skin did not absorb.  Agghhh, I finally figured out the mystery when I put my contacts in, some fool had put the lotion where the condition was supposed to be and vice versa.  Back into the shower to revive my overly limp hair.

In summation, I loved the room itself.  In the several interactions I had with service staff, servers and tres unobservant security officers, I was not even once impressed.  The drinks were overpriced at the bar and there was no casino.  No shortage of bells and whistles at this hotel however....from trains and police sirens that is.

This will be a do not repeat for me.",6,8,2

You get a rectangular community center pool. 

The rooms, however, are pretty nice and come with a kitchenette. And a stove. 

They really shouldn't have given us a stove. 

The third day of our stay, I woke up drowsily in the morning to the smell of roasting chestnuts, reminding me simultaneously of Christmas and chestnuts sold on the streets in Hong Kong. Pleasant. It looked hazy in the room. I must've been really tired; this is a sign to sleep some more. I half wake again. Chestnuts going strong. Hazier now. Smoky, really. I sit up. The room looks like we hotboxed for 8 hours. 

Long story short, a towel burned in a pot throughout the night and we got charged $200 for smoke damage.

The room was well appointed, but not quite as well designed as The Signature, which is my benchmark for the Vegas Strip.

But my stay here turned out to be pleasant, and I wouldn't mind returning in the future.

+ Friendly staff. We received a call from the front desk after we entered our room to see if we are happy with everything.
+ Walking distance to the fashion mall. If shopping is your thing, then you've come to the right place. The entrance to Nordstrom is a crosswalk away.
+ Complimentary shuttle to Caesar's Palace. Runs every 15 minutes until midnight, but I wish they would extend this by an hour or two.
+ Spacious room and great in room amenities. Love the huge Jacuzzi tub in the bathroom!
+ Gym is clean and smells really nice! Seven to eight treadmills! They even offer yoga class in the morning for $12. Wish I had known about it earlier to take advantage of this.

= Free valet. My feeling on this is neutral since I'm not a big fan of valet because why pay\/tip someone to park when you can do it yourself? I kind of got used to this idea towards the end of my stay. But I still prefer to park my own car. The driveway to this hotel can get a little hectic with people dropping off their cars, waiting for the cars, shuttles, and taxis. This area can definitely be improved.
= Some Yelpers complained about the noise from the train tracks. I actually heard the noise too on my first night. But it didn't affect my sleep at all, and I didn't hear anything on my second night.

- No magnifying mirror in the bathroom. I really like having those in the bathrooms. And was bummed when I didn't see one. It makes looking at myself a lot harder when I'm practically blind without my contacts
- No casino. Some would see this as a plus, especially if you don't gamble. I don't consider myself to be a gambler at all, but would still prefer to play a game or two here and there.
- Resort fee of $28. Well, they say it's $25 per night, but they bill you another $3 for resort fee tax. 
- Terrible phone reception. I had little to no reception in my room on the 24th floor.

The Bad
There is no Casino at this hotel. That was a little disappointing. It is also not on the strip, it is about 1 block of the strip across from the mall. 

The Good
The rooms were comfortable, the bed was great, and the jetted tub was fantastic. The rooms are great for families they come equipped with a cooktop, microwave and refrigerator. Perfect for extended stays.

Service
Front desk staff were friendly and seemed to care about me have a great experience at their hotel. The Valet staff were efficient, called from my room to bring my car around and when I got down there it was! The house keeping staff did not hit the mark. They were slow, very slow!

The hotel does offer a free shuttle service to the strip which is a plus. However, you have to wait in a line in order to take the shuttle which sucks. 

The hotel is right in front of a mall which is a plus. The hotel shopping includes very little. The hotel offers ivanka trump's items (of course). I have one of her clutches and its a high priced item with poor quality materials and generic handsmanship.

The room we got was spacious and had lots of window. It has a pretty yet typical Vegas view. The room was fresh. 

I would have wanted a hotel closer to the strip but we wanted to be closer to the convention center. This hotel was a shorter cab ride to the convention center. It was a compromise we were willing to make. 

As far as the look of the hotel, it's definitely more traditional rather than the grand casino hotels surrounding the trump.

The hotel is close to the train tracks and the cheaper rooms face them and even on the highest level of floors you can be awakened from a dead sleep as they pass through. 

The carpets in the room hallways are dirty, stained, loose and buckled and need to be stretched or replaced. 

The ac in our room never went below 72 no matter what temperature we set it at. The window vent was loose in our room causing a constant low roaring sound. Maintenance did address both of these issues and they were both greatly improved. 

The tub drain is on the wrong side of the tub. You have to get in tub to open and close the drain.

Housekeeping is meh, they never cleaned the sinks or tub the whole time we were there. You also only get one bar of soap that you must share between the separate shower, tub and dual sinks.

The rooms are gorgeous, and it's nice and quiet, but the service is horrible and it's in this awkward LOT (really the worst location ever.  Donald got screwed.  Imagine building a Hyatt at a truck stop).  And btw, you can forget staying here if you rented a car.

After a 6hr flight, where, even in first, I got stuck with an obnoxious, drunken pervert as my neighbor, the last thing I want to be is RUSHED out of my cab when I pull up in your tiny ass traffic lanes by your totally incompetent SCUMBAG scammer bellmen and valet boys.

I booked a corner suite.  I check in to find that my room was double-booked, and ALTHOUGH I showed up FIRST, I could NOT be given the room.  WTF?  OK.... ""FINE.  What do you have?"".  Her answer?  Two penthouses.  I almost felt relieved, but remembered that her words weren't ""Okay, Mrs. _____, here's your room"".  They were, ""Well, we have a 1br penthouse and the 3br penthouse available"".  Yeah.  That MEANT that I had to pay the difference (which, that night, a WEEKEND was almost $800 more than the 400\/night for my corner suite, AND I was staying 3 nights!)  I was in disbelief.  How could that be happening?  I'd NEVER encountered anything like that EVER, and for years, I spent almost every night of my life in-and-out of hotels.  I spoke to the manager, who, in the rosiest way told me that if I walked out, they would charge me for my entire stay (at the rate of the original room)!  But if I stayed, and took one of the remaining penthouses, she would only comp me for one night for my inconvenience.  Omg, I felt like strangling them, I was going to lose devastatingly either way.  So, I stayed, and obviously took the ONE br penthouse (who would even offer the 3 br for one person?).  I was fuming.  I stormed up to my room, which OKAY, was gorgeous, really one of the best looking rooms I have stayed at in Vegas.  Great view, beautiful, tasteful decor.. it was clean, new, shiny- pretty much everything you basically expect from a penthouse suite.  Really though, I'm not the type of person to want a penthouse for MYSELF.

I called for my bags to be sent up so I could just try to take a fucking nap and forget all that bullshit, and it took almost an hour and 3 calls down for them to get to me.

I decided to avoid the long cab line I noticed checking in and called a car svc to take me to dinner later that evening.  DUE to what I later discovered as NO cell service, 10 min after his eta, I get a vm from the driver 10 min before his said arrival time, saying he's getting shooed away and asking if I could I come down now.  WTF.  I scramble down to find that he's not there, and call him back to find that he left and had to take another fare because I didn't call back.  Now I'm standing in the 30000-deep cab line, and am already late for dinner with my associates.  It was at this point where a valet approached me and proposed that I take a limo for $35\/mi, and that my destination was only 5 min away, so it would be like $15.  I was going to Marche Bacchus- at the Lakes... an almost $50 cab ride, and he tells me it's 5 min and ""$15"" for his limo!?  At AT LEAST 10 miles, I would have gotten dipped for over $350.  Thank god I know this town, what a lying scumbag!

Sometime after, I'd spread the story and a friend told me that he'd encountered a similar experience with a double-booking mishap and not being able to get the room after having showed up first and explained that whomever booked the same room was probably from priceline.  It's mainly to do with pre-paying (and thereby guaranteeing) the room through priceline.  Anyway, I had the worst time here.  I WILL NEVER go back.  Yes, I realize my experience is primarily based on double-booking- a fluke that I've encountered several times before, BUT it's the way it was handled, trapping me in a catch-22, and later showcasing SHIT service throughout the hotel, that I'm writing about and based on that, if I could give negative stars, I would!

After a 4 night stay here, I've came to appreciate many things about the property and wish more on other fronts.

Design (3\/5): I found plenty of uniqueness in the gold slab exterior of the building as well as the design of the room. That being said, I felt the design of the room was reminiscent of something that one would find at an old Soviet hotel, with the wood paneling across the entire wall and traditional furniture. Although I do have respect for whoever liked that, I absolutely do not and felt that the room should have been better appointed. Lobby was quite beautiful, lots of flowers, but otherwise was not too interesting.

Service (5\/5): all the interactions with hotel staff were absolutely flawless and people were genuinely kind. Room service was very timely, which is a big plus.

Amenities (3\/5): I knew this hotel was not for me when I went to the pool and it was filled with children. The water in the pool looked so cloudy, it had to have seen better days. There were lots and lots of people for the size of the pool, which is frankly the case with most vegas pools. There was loud party music playing and tons of kids, so the combination of the two was not the scene I'd like. Otherwise, the pool is very basic. Good lounge chairs. Nothing really interesting.

Comfort (5\/5): bedding was extremely comfy and he shower was rather big. I felt that this room was made for comfort, with extra amenities like microwave and larger than normal fridge.

To summarize, i did not feel that this was quite a 5 star hotel. There was nothing particularly wrong here and depending on the price tag, I'd consider staying again. At the end of the day though, it did not excite me. The most beautiful aspect of the property is the exterior, followed by a lobby full of flowers. Location is great and it is close enough to walk all across the strip. A particularly good choice if you want to visit Encore beach club or the excellent buffet at Wynn.",3,1,2

I stayed there the first weekend of the year and had an experience that probably can not be topped.  Everything was perfect to a T. 

After check in, the bell boy very promptly brought my bags up to the room, and since it was my first time there showed me all the nifty features of the room - like the in-mirror TV screen, how to use the jacuzzi tub, how to operate the safe, all the kitchen utensils and supplies available, etc.  I was very impressed by the room.  Not only this, he went the extra mile and asked if I had any questions about my stay in Vegas.  I asked about nightclubs around.  (I usually go to XS but wanted to try a different place.)  He let me know that the Bell Desk could take care of all my nighttime arrangements....which they did - more on that later. 

Room service - perfection.  The food was nice and hot, very nicely presented, and they accommodated my picky eating habits (light dressing on the side, no cheese, no butter, you know, all the LA stuff).

Beds were so comfortable I wanted to lay there forever.  

OK, so back to the night I went out.  Me and my girls (there were 6 of us) dressed to the nines, trounce down to the Bell Desk for our night out.  Dwight, I think that was his name, gives me a cell phone number to text for our reservation at Tao (so that we don't have to wait in line - we didn't have to wait later that night).  Not only this, they chauffeur all 6 of us over to Tao.  For free. We even got a number to call at the end of the night to get a ride back.   Seriously.  Now that's what I call great service.  

Only possible downside of the Trump is that there is no casino.  I actually liked this fact because it made me feel like I was coming home to a peaceful environment.  So for me, it was a bonus.

""Yes.""
""I'm looking at you on the camera."" - Trump International Hotel Las Vegas Security Officer Giel called after searching for me in the surveillance video for 1.5 hours and, at my request, another 15 minutes to finally spot me. It sounded creepy if there was no context, but I grinned from the inside with the new hope to be a step closer to the search for the camera I had left behind in a cab I got on.

""You were with a skinny guy in light blue shirt right?""
""Uh... I call him fat.""
Officer laughed.

The night was too dark and the video was too blurry for Officer Giel to help me spot the cab number (so I can find the camera I left behind), but he was able to give me the cab colors(!!!) and two cab companies to track down.

Who would've thought hotel security would go through such troubles for customers?
Kudos to Trump's Security! Thank you Mr. Officer Giel! =)

Second...there are absolutely no bells or  whistles here.  You basically get a room which is moderately surface cleaned but pales in comparison to the Trump in Chicago.  Little things like dusty shampoo bottles and mystery spots on the towels were surprising.  We had a leak in our room which created a big wet spot on the rug.  There was no mini bar, no alarm clock, no turn down service and they forgot to clean our room once during our stay.

Guests have to pay for basic use of the spa??  Theres no buffet so we had to either pay $80.00 for two breakfasts or walk over to the Wynn for their awesome buffet.

I called several times and they eventually reviewed security cameras and found that it was delivered into another guests room. Our doorbell man initially had given us someone else's luggages and had to go find ours. After asking the guest, which my blanket was delivered to, they said it was not there. I was in so much disbelieve because I had called the same day that the blanket had gone missing and did not get a final answer until the morning of checkout.

They ended up giving me a clean used blanket as replacement, but it was bulky, the color was not pleasing, and was a bad material. I used it on the plane because I was cold yet it was too thick that it made me feel too warm at times. I just really wanted my original blanket.

We arrived in Las Vegas around 3:00pm and after picking up our luggage and packing into a taxi, we arrived at Trump around 4:00pm. The problem? Our room hadn't been cleaned and was not ready.. not would it be ready for another few hours. After a flight with six ladies pumped up for a weekend of shenanigans in Vegas for a bachelorette party, a wait for the room on account of management's fault is extremely inconveniencing.

If it wasn't for the complaining and negotiating skills of one of the girls in our party, we would have never gotten Trump to properly apologize for the inconvenience. Thanks to her, we were offered a round of drinks in the lounge and dinner via room-service later on that night, all on the house as an apology for the situation.

When we walked into our two bedroom suite on one of the top-most floors facing the strip, it was simply a beautiful sight. Logistics: six females, three pull-out couches, two king beds, a kitchen and 3 full bathrooms? You could definitely say it was going to be a good weekend.

The best part of it? We paid a great price for our stay.. I'd say, but a woman shouldn't boast about her deal-finding skills.

My stay at the trump tower was fine, but nothing to crazy happened here.  Very quite hotel, more older folks stay here and couples.  I just wanted more excitement, but hey that's me, I'm on Vacay there! i want crazy things to happened, things I can talk about when i come back to the reality world the work world ;-\. .  I did not like how there is a guard there checking your room key, so its not like you can have all your friends come down and pre-drink before you head out.  To me this place is for people who want to come relax and chill, but you can get that else where for that why Vegas?? lol 

The Pool area is ok, nice people got hit up by a girl there so that was cool ahah.  But there music was wack trying to be like Wet Repub and Rehab music, they need a better DJ, and the view from my room to the pool the water looked dirty!

Very nice people working here, checking in took a while but that's the case in Vegas. Very helpful staff as well, I asked a big intimidating security guard for directions and he didn't buzz me off, shoo me away, like other resorts I've been to. I got one of the ""cheap"" rooms (compared to the others), and it was way, WAY beyond expectations! They seriously go above and beyond here. Can't comment on the food in Trump, but the bar was fantastic as well. Speaking of food, Trump Tower as far away as it is from the strip (not very), Fashion Show Mall is literally across the street if you can manage walking to the food court. Valet parking is a huge plus if you just want to get to Vegas, check in and go - there is a free shuttle every 15 minutes to either Wynn (also a short walk away, but still nice) or Ceasers which lands you on the strip for more Vegas exploring. Who wants to actually drive on the strip anyway? There is no gambling or smoking in the building which personally I am fine with - some of these casino resorts get crazy with getting to your room, and at Trump when you are ready for bed it's just through the lobby and to your room. And the room itself, oh my God. AWESOME view of the strip, amazing layout, I figured since I went cheaper I'd be in a smaller room but there were two full bathrooms, one shower with two shower heads in it, jacuzzi, full fridge (not typical mini bar), stove and oven, A DISHWASHER... I honestly couldn't have asked for a better experience in Vegas and I highly, HIGHLY recommend Trump Tower to anyone looking.

I get that it's politic season and everyone is different. Don't let that nonsense get to you. Separate that for a minute with the resort itself. If you like walking the strip while your car is parked away nicely from it, with complimentary shuttle, to come back straight to your room no fuss and hop in a jacuzzi, go swimming or grab some food either in the Tower or at the mall... Don't think twice! Some people here have talked about staff being rude. I think people have their ""off days"" and while it never happened in my experience I'm not saying it doesn't happen. Honestly I think the people working there could *possibly* get stressed for making sure your stay is perfect and I applaud them for it. I did see a man as I was replacing a lost room key have two team members, one apparently a manager, handling what I can only assume a booking issue very seriously and professionally. I do not know the end to that story but I can only assume by the way they were handling it to have it work out for that gentleman.

If you absolutely need to be on the strip, then this obviously isn't the place for you. Otherwise, you cannot go wrong with Trump Tower. I cannot stress how highly highly HIGHLY I recommend it!",1,1,0

The bed was AMAZING, like sleeping on a cloud. The bathroom had a jacuzzi tub big enough for two people. It was the ultimate place to relax and unwind.

Upon arrival, we got into our room quickly. As we settled in, we turned the TV on. Or tried....it didn't work. We called downstairs and within 10 minutes, maintenance came up. It was a quick fix with a circuit breaker issue and he was on his way. 

We then went downstairs for a drink in the lounge. When we got back upstairs, we then saw that the garbage can near the desk had not been emptied. There were dirty q-tips on the floor near the garbage can, and it was filled with empty coffee creamer, orange seeds, etc. After inspecting the rest of the room, I realized that the bathroom tub wasn't all that clean. Not feeling all that confident that the room had been thoroughly cleaned, I called down and asked for a room switch. 

I was told that they would send somebody up with new room keys and escort us to our new room. That took about 25 minutes. Now we were on a time crunch to get showered and ready for dinner. 

Upon entering the new room, my husband tried the TV. Guess what? It didn't work! Surprise, surprise. At this point, we had to leave for dinner so we called down to let them know that the second room's TV didn't work either. 

In a rush to make our reservation, we left the room and realized we forgot something, so we ran back to the room. The new keys didn't work! 

Sigh....we decided to wait until we got home later that evening to deal with it. 

Later we got back to the hotel and talked with the front desk. We explained our situation and politely expressed our annoyances with what had happened since check-in. The person working the desk said he needed to check on something for us. When he came back, he told us that he ""wanted us to go and settle in our room and enjoy yourselves"" and that he would be ""sending a bottle of champagne up to the room for you."" But he kept repeating that he wanted us to ""enjoy ourselves"", which was a little creepy to me.   

It was 2:30 am by the time we got to the room and I was ready to go to bed. We waited and waited and finally I fell asleep. About 40 minutes later, the bottle of champagne was brought up to our room. 

As the weekend progressed, there were more things that were disappointing. The second TV in the bathroom never worked, there was a light out in the bathroom and the toilet barely flushed. However, we just let it go because we thought we'd just get another bottle of champagne...whoo-hoo! I'm not even a champagne drinker, so that ""reward"" meant nothing for the inconvenience. 

We've stayed at several wonderful 5 star hotels in Vegas....the Wynn, Mandarin Oriental, Cosmopolitan...and the Trump has a long way to go if it wants to be compared to these hotels!

There was a little kitchen area, complete with microwave, dishwasher, stove top, and dishes and utensils. The bed was super plush and comfortable. However, I slept on the pull out sofa bed most of my stay there and it was actually pretty comfortable. Just don't try to fit another person in the bed; it's not so comfortable at that point. 

There's a shuttle to the Wynn and Caesar's Palace. My friends and I took full advantage of the shuttle service. All the drivers were so kind and friendly. My friends and I chatted up all of them and asked for advice and recommendations. Not only were the drivers really nice, the entire staff at the Trump were great! We were always greeted with a smile. One evening we were heading to the Rio for dinner and one of the managers called one of their cars for us instead of a cab. It seemed like such a small gesture but truly appreciated. 

Last but not least, the pool. It was a very quiet pool with more families than party people. It was actually relaxing to sit by or in the pool instead of worrying about how I looked or if everyone was judging me. I definitely do not need a Vegas-style pool party.

Pros:
+ Emphasis on healthy food with 24 hour room service delivering relatively healthy options.
+ Clean simple lobby without casino chaos
+ Big pool area with 2 Jacuzzi
+ Nice rooms that appear to be originally designed as condos (kitchenettes)
+ Fun Trump themed items to buy in the trump store
+ Free trump branded bottles of water 24\/7

Cons:
+ Nothing exiting to see or do in the hotel unlike any other hotel in Las Vegas
+ Hotel windows are made with 14 carat glass (Not sure if that is even a real thing???).  This is nice to look at except during sunset when it combines with reflections off the golden windows of the Wynn and Encore and creates a deathray of of the suns reflection that moves stealthily around the pool area.
+ Check in process seems slow.  Why don't they have your address and email on file when you have already entered it to make your reservation?
+ No in-room snack bar (isn't this a major profit center for most hotels)?  On second thought I didn't miss the $17 bag of pretzels.",1,0,2

The only thing I found irksome about the hotel was the reminder that this was the structure with the tacky gold exterior that served as an eyesore every single other time I've been to Vegas and had a room with a view of the hotel (four too many times). However, once we were inside our room (or suite, really), we were pleased to find out the kitschy facade was a byproduct of Trump's infamous ego that didn't affect the interior design team's personal taste. 

The rooms are incredible - and SO complete... kitchen's equipped with a microwave, stove, fridge, china, pots\/pans, and silverware. You can request complimentary bubble bath and sea salts and indulge in a nice long bath with the LCD on if you'd like.. It's definitely the perfect long-stay hotel. 

However, if you're in Vegas to smoke, party, and gamble.... I'm not sure if you're aware but the entire hotel is smoke-free (you're going to have to step outside to smoke), there's no casino on-site (you'd have to walk 15 minutes to get to the Wynn), and the only thing to eat in the building is either room service or DJT. (I'm not sure how DJT made it into the '09 Michelin Guide with it being permanently empty and having so many awful reviews......)

The rooms.... WOW, amazing!!  Very luxurious and sophisticated feel.  The beds are super comfy, and there is plenty of space to stretch out and lounge around.  The bathroom has a TV built into the mirror, which was pretty cool.  The bathtub is HUGE!!  You can very easily fit 2 adults in there comfortably.

Some things I did not like were the valet staff, not very friendly or helpful.  I did not like paying the $20\/nt resort fee which I was not informed of until check-in.  However, I did like that the resort fee included internet, shuttle service, shoe shine, etc.  No casino was kind of a downside, but the peace and quiet was a good trade off.

Yes, this place is a little off the strip, but its not too bad.  5min walk to Wynn.  Plus there is a free shuttle that takes you to the corner of Wynn & Las Vegas Blvd. and there is another shuttle that takes you to Caesar's so you're pretty much in decent walking distance to everything.  The shuttle saved us over $20\/day on cab fare anyway so it balances out.

Good - the bed was very comfortable and the room had plenty of space.  The bathroom was beautiful with a spa tub and huge shower.  The shuttle service to Caesers Palace was very convenient and the shuttle drivers were all very personable.  The front desk clerk was super friendly when we checked in.

Bad - ""City View"" is on the back side of the hotel and there is a train track that runs back there.  We were on the 47th floor and the train whistle was still loud in the morning.  I would suggest upgrading to the other side of the hotel which would be a view of the mall.

The location is not far from the strip but if you like to walk it is definitely off the beaten path a bit.  My husband and I walked back after midnight and there is no way I would have felt comfortable alone.  On the strip I am never worried.

Good\/Bad - obviously there is no casino at this hotel.  I liked it because it was quieter and easy to access the rooms but when my husband wanted to go to bed and I wanted to stay up it was a bummer to not have the option to stay up by myself in an onsite casino.

This hotel has served as lodging for two consecutive Vegas trips. My buddies and I stayed in spacious and comfortable rooms. We had just about everything we needed here for both before, and after, a night of debauchery along the strip. 
My room came with a nice view, a comfortable bed, and a bathroom that had a TV built into the mirror. The place was decorated with elegance, and the staff was friendly and helpful.
The pool area was smaller than expected, but there was not a large crowd so it was still enjoyable. There is a bar with some food options adjacent to the pool area, as well as a standard hotel gym.
This hotel is not actually on the strip, but that's not a bad thing. The parking is not a hassle here. The lot is right next to the building, and there are more than enough spots to chose from. 
The hotel is not far from a Macy's, where I bought some clothing to go out the nights I was there.

Everyone has different standard about tipping but I don't think this considers a bad tip at all for house keeping? Or maybe I'm wrong. I'm not sure what's the reason but at our last night here, my parents were asked for the room key when we were trying to enter the elevator area. The other groups before us were not asked for that. The reasoning we were given when we called the front desk is that it is the hotel's policy to check for room card After 7pm. The funny thing is that this is our 4th night here at the trump and we have been coming back to hotel after 7pm every night and was never asked for the room card (Who goes back to hotel before 7pm in Vegas anyways!?!!  ).

We are very disappointed. Not to mention the house keeping people are not doing their best job replenish stuff at all. In short, I do not recommend this hotel at all. It is not at all a convenient location and the service is questionable. We did not get a very satisfying response even when we called the front desk to voice out opinion.

We like the fact that there is no casino on the premises. No annoying cigarette smoke and having to walk past slot machine after slot machine to get to the elevators. Instead, the hotel lobby was shiny, spacious and glamourous. There's a piano player in the lobby and a nice quiet restaurant. The hotel staff that checked us in were very accomodating.

I think we must have gone on weekend that wasn't busy because I felt like I had the whole spa to myself! The sauna and steam room were completely empty for the 3 hours I spent there. Roxanne was a great massage therapist and was so kind to listen to me vent about my stresses back at home. oh fyi, if you book a service, just pay for it at the spa because if you charge it to the room, they tack on an extra 18% for the convenience fee. The hotel offers free shuttles to Ceasars and the Wynn. I think they stop running to Ceasars at midnight and the the Wynn at 2am but they are both within walking distance.

I would've if they didn't mess up the next day as well. Gave us the run around about putting us in the right room. We had our bags packed until about 6pm we were moved, kept getting told someone was on their way to the room. The fact that we were waiting around til then to get the room which I paid more for was ridiculous and insult to injury. It wasted our whole day since we were at a standstill. The least you guys could've done is compped a night for us. A meal credit was insufficient. A discount for an additional night was insufficient as wouldn't have felt like I needed to stay an extra day to make up to my family the nightmare you guys provided. Then I get home to find out you guys had 2 unaccounted for charges to my atm, which finally were cleared. You guys didn't care to make this right when you had the chance. You truly showed no care for customer satisfaction! 5 stars? Not at all

I am not big into casinos,  so the Trump was good on that front.   The lobby is beautiful and the staff is very professional. 
My suite was beautiful and the bathroom was quite large.   The view of the city was remarkable and the pool was really nice. 
I like mentioning that the pool was really nice because I spent my time at this casino-free oasis whenever I could. 
There is a bar in the dining area in the lobby and a bar in the awesome pool area.  
It is quite possible that the pool area was remarkable because of me.  I did not build or plan the pool area,  but I was there in swim trunks.  
I might need to put this in perspective.   I am quite attractive, and when you put multiple attractive people in a pool and they are wearing swimsuits, good things are going to happen, and happen they did.   Everyone that was not gambling or searching for women was at the pool,  looking awesome.  I was their leader.   Smelling with the sweet scent of Trumpy soap (that is what I called it), we all enjoyed the pool in the Las Vegas heat, our perfect Greek-godlike bodies glowing like stars, then we all ate too much and got fat, so we hurried to the airport and went home. 
Then we all blamed Donald Trump for our weight gain. 
But do not be like us.  Go stay at the Trump and enjoy the pool.  I think they may be building a wall between the hotel and the mall to keep the fast food vendors and Uber Eats at bay.

The room had sculpted vases and Ansel Adams coffee table books, the toilet has its own frosted-glass enclosure, the ice machine had its own room. Very clean, very updated, and very Vegas. 

The pool area was awesome - lots of chairs, and a very large pool so you won't be right on top of everyone else. They also have ice water that they pass out for free on super-hot days. My personal fave was the polarized windows along the pool that everyone kept using as a mirror.

Upon learning that they offer their guests free shuttle bus services to select hotels, I decided to utilize it. I sat for 20 minutes outside in the piping hot sun waiting for a shuttle bus to take me and my infant son to Caesar's Palace. Once a shuttle bus arrived, a white female guest rushed to get inside. As I approached the door, the white driver (Billy) told me to step back. He then asked me where was I heading. I told him I needed to go to CP. He yelled at me that he's going to take the other guest to Wynn. I politely explained to him that I was there first, so I should be priority. He screamed at me that he's taking her and he'll come back for me next. I asked him if we could both be accommodated on this particular trip since she was his only passenger and no other guests were waiting. He said NO very firmly and sped off. I ran into the hotel looking for someone in upper Management. I was highly upset because I had limited time to meet my mother before she left Las Vegas. I couldn't believe how rude and disrespectful he was acting towards a guest. I was so embarrassed and hurt. I reported him and was told someone would contact me later regarding this incidence. They ended up giving me a ""VIP"" parking pass for future use and they waived their $30 resort fees from my bill. They also deducted a lunch I ordered and charged to my room for in-suite dining. I asked for a full refund and was quickly shut down. I was told that since I pre-paid for my room online, they wouldn't be able to reimburse me. They ruined what was suppose to be a joyous weekend for me. I flew there to surprise my mother who had just got engaged while vacationing in the area. My whole mood shifted after dealing with his blatant racism. I felt like my voice wasn't being heard nor was my money of any value to them. I have never received treatment like this before! I guess the driver saw a young black woman with a baby and figured he could get away with mistreating me since they obviously stick together behind the scenes. They don't care how their guests are treated as long as they have paid in full! They even went as far as to say he had an alternate route and didn't service CP. Then I exposed him...I told them he definitely takes that route because once I was ready to be picked up from CP, he was the driver. I quietly bypassed him and waited on the next driver. I wouldn't feel safe riding with him. I still think they should refund me for my troubles. I ended up staying at another hotel after they refused to give me a free extended stay or refund.

When we came to check in, they automatically upgraded us to VIP.  Then, we went to a separate office to have a personal concierge who takes care of our entire stay.  Our room was upgraded to a City View Suite, (we only paid about $100 a night) and was greeted everytime we walked in and went back to our room.

About 10 minutes after we checked in and was personally seen to our room by the concierge, we got a phone call from the manager making sure that everything was ok.  Our room was HUGE and we didn't expect it to be that big.  We were amazed once we walked in.

It had a kitchen, living room with pullout couch overlooking the strip, plasma tvs, two bathrooms (one for any additional guests and one for us).  

The bedroom had a king-size bed with down comforter and pillows, robes, and a couch.  The closets were pretty spacious and were separate for his and hers.  In addition, there was an iHome in the room so we can listen to our iPods and iPhone when we woke up.

The master bathroom was huge; it had two showers, a separate toilet room, a vanity desk for makeup, a jacuzzi whirlpool tub, his and her sinks, and even a TV in the bathroom mirror.  It was bigger than the bedroom itself!

He said all he could do is give me a drink voucher.   Really?   How much did I pay to go through all that, stay here and NOT use your valet that is already included in the price of my stay? Also, the luggage rack broke when we put our suitcase on it. This is not how I expected Trump hotel would handle adversity.  Other than that, the room was adequate.  As a side note, The Signature  at Mgm is very similar to Trump suites and also better priced.",1,0,0

NEGATIVE: 
-We arrived to the 44th floor and when we stepped in it smelled as if the toilet had been clogged for weeks!
-The blanket on the bed looks a lot fluffier on the website than in person. It's literally 2 bed sheets with a throw blanket in between! C'mon Donald, investing in some quality blankets wouldn't have hurt your wallet at the rates you charge!
 -The jacuzzi and pool was closed
-There was a dirty used pillow in one of the closets
-We requested another room (17th floor) and the tv was a lot smaller compared to the smelly room (not a big deal but I'm reviewing it)
-Not as updated as the other hotels. Example: the blinds do not have a remote to electronically close them
-In our new room it looked like the stove was left on?

Positive:
-Free wifi
-Walked into the hotel lobby, it smelled GREAT!
-The tv built into the mirror in the bathroom is cool
-The front desk did not hesitate to move us to another room
-it's not on the strip BUT it's facing fashion show mall so that's convenient 

All in all this hotel is ok yet isn't the best. I'll keep exploring other hotel options in Vegas. It's not the MGM but because it's owned by a horribly rich narcissist, I just had higher expectations for it....",16,7,4

I was taking meetings all morning today.  My phone died late morning, and I had to use the hotel room phone to complete my calls.   When I went to check out, I learned I'd been charged $164 for 47 min spent on the room phone.  The price for calls wasn't listed anywhere on the phone, as is generally done at respectable hotels, and while I knew it wouldn't be free, would've completely rescheduled my meetings had I known I'd be charged so excessively.

When I brought this up to the desk clerk - who appeared to be about 21 yrs old - he said that was just the policy and at check-in should've been told that only local calls were included.  I was never told that, and asked if I could speak to a manager.  He went back to retreive a manager, but instead came back and offered to take half off one of the 2 charges.  I didn't have time to haggle, so just accepted it and went to the airport.

I am incredibly disappointed at the lack of transparency, and then the lack of responding to the issue I raised professionally.  The manager couldn't even come out to the front desk to speak with me personally?  I assumed the Trump organization would have more professional staff employed.

Even with 50% removed from one of the charges, I was still charged $102.48 for 47 min of talk time.  I don't think I should be charged anything considering a) lack of phone information clearly displayed or explained, and b) lack of professional demeanor in handling my conflict.

The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 here is because a) the hotel and room were beaufiful, and b) Nathan, one of the valets, was extremely nice and helpful every time I had a question re: directions.

I go to Vegas for at least 6 times a year since it's only 4-hour drive from LA. Im kinda a heavy gambler so I've never stayed at a smoke-free and casino-free hotel. I decided to tag along with my friends at last minute so I didn't have a choice. 
Pros-
- we did the $20 trick upon check-in and got upgraded to one bedroom suite 
- full kitchen in the room with microwave. Big plus for me cuz I eat leftovers in the room in the morning all the time to save time and money, and I do not like to eat cold leftover!
- 2 full bathrooms in the suite. Good for group of friends to share. 
- big windows in the room with good view!
- big big Jacuzzi tub in the master bathroom next to a big window. Will definitely enjoy the view and Jacuzzi when I bring my partner here next time =D 
- staffs are super friendly
- internet connection is really good in the room.

Cons-
- since I went with a couple, I slept on the sofa bed in the living. I have to say it is the worst sofa bed ever. Super thin and shorter than usual mattress. Hurt my back so much. It might have been better if I just slept on the sofa. 
- I asked for 2 extra blankets. One of them has a big hole (looks burned ). It just looks gross to me. 
- phones have really bad signal in the room.

Will definitely recommend couples to stay in the one bedroom suite for the view and Jacuzzi. Bring some candles too!! 
Another tip for people who want to stay at trump in the future. Try to book the room on hotwire for mystery hotel. After electing location and date, choose 5-star, north strip, and smoke-free hotel. Trump is the ONLY 5-star hotel on the north strip without casino. The rate is usually way cheaper this way!! (I have successfully booked trump room for friends through hotwire for half of the regular rate!) 

PS, 5-star hotel on south strip without casino on hotwire mystery hotel is usually Vdara",2,0,1

It's an excellent buffer after going all night long, because the thought of getting up at 10 or 11 is just plain awful. 

The bathroom is huge and includes a shower large enough to fit a party of four people (if that's your kind of thing) and a bathtub deep enough to store all your winnings. And there's a TV in the mirror in the event you want to bathe in your money and catch some prime time.

The rooms are spacious and though there's no casino to amuse you, it's walking distance from some of the more desirable entertainment locations of the strip.

Pros:
Great service. We had a few issues while staying there, and it was always dealt with immediately. The guys at the front and driving the shuttles were super helpful.
Room came with mini fridge, hot plate, microwave, lots of shelves, even a sink that has a garbage disposal!
Big tub, perfect for soaking your feet with your friends after a night of dancing. 
Free shuttles to and from Wynn and the Forum shopping center.
$20 gives you access to the spa for the day; I didn't go but the girls that did loved it.
Non-smoking

Cons:
A little ways from the main part of the strip. It always took a lot longer to get there and back than we thought it would.
There is a pool (and two hot tubs) and you can order food and drinks, but there are helicopters flying right over you the whole time. I wouldn't pay for the special seating; the pool isn't anything special. It also closes at sunset.
One side of the hotel is pretty close to the train, bring earplugs just in case.

My husband took me here this weekend to celebrate my 34th birthday and he picked the perfect place.  He knows I thoroughly enjoy a nice, swanky hotel and this was literally perfection!  When we checked in, the man helping us briefly disappeared (into the backroom, talking with the manager.  I think it was over which rooms were clean and ready, maybe?) and we were left hanging a bit.  After expressing our confusion and slight frustration after having to stand there wondering what was going on (for at least 10 minutes) to a co-worker also working the desk, our guy reappeared.  He then immediately apologized for the delay and, without any prompting from us, gave us an upgrade to a corner suite with panoramic windows with views of the Strip.  Needless to say, it wasn't that big of a deal and we wouldn't have asked for anything, we were just a bit confused.  But the free upgrade was very much appreciated, especially since it was my birthday!
The suite room was 1000 sq feet - bigger than some of my previous apartments.  The bathroom is phenomenal - bigger than my current bedroom.  Absolutely gorgeous finishes, everything is ultra high end and classy.  There's a bubble bath with a view of the Strip, plus a tv located inside the bathroom mirror that you can watch while in the tub.  The shower fits a small family. The bed is perfect with wonderful linens.   Since it was a suite, there was a full ""living room"" with large couch and flat panel tv, and a full kitchen, with microwave, oven w\/electric cook-top, dishwasher and full size refrigerator.  Wifi was free and had a great signal, no trouble with it (which seems to be unique at hotels these days!).   All around wonderful!  
Our only, very small, complaint was the poor selection of tv channels.  Which really isn't a huge deal but I was bummed because I'm not a great sleeper and there was nothing good to watch (for free anyway) while I was laying awake.  They should definitely add a few more good channels to their ""basic"" television programming.  But  overall, for the price we paid, around $200, it was amazing.  We will definitely be back!  

PS  We also ate dinner at the restaurant located inside the hotel, I think it's called DJT, and it was the best dinner of my life.  The chicken, the orzo, the entire meal was absolutely phenomenal.  If you stay here, eat there!!!

ETA: I forgot to include one of my favorite parts of staying here.  Their standard checkout time is 4 p.m.!!!!  I absolutely *loved* that and think every hotel should consider it.

This is Vegas - parking is plentiful and a God-given right.  Fortunately, having to valet my car is my only complain with this joint.  I gotta give 'em credit, considering my computers, wallet and watch were still in the vehicle when I picked it up.

Caveat: I didn't stay here overnight.  I spent the day with a client in the Executive Suite on the 64th Floor.  The view of the west valley was phenomenal.  If only I wasn't there on business, I'd have snapped a ton of pics.

The room was huge.  I only got to see the kitchen, living and dining areas and one of the bathrooms, but it was BIG.  The odd thing is that I would have expected the place to be far more, um, ostentatious, considering it's a ""Trump"" property.  I guess I was expecting something more along the lines of his Taj Mahal or even the Trump Towers in NYC.  Instead, the room was very understated (that's not a complaint).  

Service was above average and everyone I came into contact was surprisingly (by Vegas standards) friendly and helpful.  There were three employees in the room and I have no idea what their functions or titles were, but they were pretty much waiting on my client's every word.

Before I write this review, let me say that I:

- don't smoke
- don't gamble
- love to shop
- don't really party
- have a husband that is pretty darn frugal
- like to sleep in

On the basis of that description, the Trump Hotel was the PERFECT Las Vegas hotel for me because it:

- is completely non smoking
- does not have a noisy casino inside
- is directly across the street from the Nordstrom entrance to the Fashion Show Mall
- does not have any rowdy clubs inside
- is CHEAP compared to other strip hotels that are less stars ($125\/night on a holiday weekend!)
- has a late checkout

The bed and bedding at this hotel are simply divine, like sleeping on clouds and sadly better than the bedding I have at home. The towels are plush and soft. And the pullout bed in the sofa is pretty comfortable. $125\/night for a five-star hotel, booked last minute on Labor Day weekend... what a steal!

The only drawbacks are: no affordable food on premise and bit of a walk to the strip (but you can walk through the Fashion Show Mall during the day). Also, a $20\/day resort fee kind of blows. But many hotels in Vegas have a resort fee, so this isn't out of the norm.

Trump, I will definitely be back!",0,0,0

Pros:
---------------------

Grand, Clean & smoke-free lobby:
Because the hotel does not have a casino, so you don't have to go through the maze-like casino full of tobacco smell just to get to the elevator. 

Room:
For standard guest room, you get:
Kitchen with Microwave, kitchen sink, stove. 
Bathroom with Jacuzzi hot tub
Separate glass door shower area
Separate glass door toilet area
Mirror got build-in TV

Room (cont):
The design of the hotel is that beside the door of your room, you share another outter door with the room next to you. So you got a little common area to share with the room next door, an upscale apartment design I guess. It will be nice if you are staying there with a larger group that you occupied both rooms. 

Hotel view:
You get a really nice view since the hotel is one of the tallest building on strip. 

Price: We got $90\/night vs. $150+ in Wynn or Bellagio. 


Cons:
---------------------
Location:
Although the hotel is considered on strip. But it is actually on Dio Dr. and about roughly 1000 feet from Las Vegas Blvd. 
You can always walk from the Norstrom (Which just cross the street of Trump) entrance through the Fashion Show Mall to get to the Strip. 
But the Mall close at 10 I believe. 
Then if you, like us were taking the Deuce (Public bus that go back & forth of the Strip) then you will have to walk back to the hotel. 
Or you will have no choice but to take the cab. 

Mandatory expenses: 
The hotel charge additional $15\/night resort fee for the amenities which does not include Internet Access (which, I really need)
I think they charge you on parking but I am not sure since I didn't drive, and they only allow valet parking, which you need to tip the valet person every time you need your car. Now consider the location of the hotel, you pretty much always need your car to go out, that's a lot of additional spending. 

Train horn:
Because there is a railroad next to the hotel, and it seems pretty busy.  You will hear the train's horn quite often during day time.  This can get quite annoying. I think this only apply to rooms that face the track. 

Conclusion: 
Again, I think this hotel is really nice, and if you're like me that plan to ""try out"" hotels each time to Vegas, Trump should definitely on the list.  

Also the location downside will be less significant once the Montreux completed next to Trump (On the former ""New Frontier Hotel"" site), then there should be complete link from Trump to LV Blvd.",3,0,0

Trump Hotel definitely caters to an entirely different kind of group of people. It's basically just a hotel, so it's not rowdy with casino machines, kids screaming and slutty girls. Why would Trump want to ruin his image?...

Hotel was great.  There's this random horse head structure inside the room, but everything else was well-designed and classy. The bathroom mirror was crazy! This little plasma TV is just embedded into the mirror! Who can beat that? The small kitchen had this cool microwave that had like a thousand features in it too. Like many other hotels, there's a divider separating the toilet area and the shower, but Trump has this one that was sort of see-through.

The only thing bad is that there's a resort fee of $19.95 per night (pricey!). This includes two bottled waters, newspaper, gym, pool, shuttle & internet. Come to think of it, we never got the chance to take advantage of the fee, because after all, we are paying for it...and we never received any water OR the newspaper.

For many (most) people, they appreciate and expect a good night's sleep when they stay away from home. They don't expect to rely on stimulants to get them through the day because they have poor sleep or don't sleep much.  While some may argue that you shouldn't sleep in Vegas, not everyone is a 20 something pumping and grinding young adult that has a huge credit card limit or line of credit.

If you don't expect to sleep much or your too out of it because you've been partying, then this Trump property is probably for you.   I am guessing this is why the Yelp ratings are inflated because it's these kinds of patrons the hotel attracts.

We just happened to stop in for a drink at the lobby bar on the way to an event.
No free wi-fi - unless you are staying there.
No bar food snacks (pretzels, etc.) available when you have a drink.
The bartender, Mexican Guy w\/sleeve tattoo - was horrible!!
My drink (diet coke) was empty for quite awhile and he never offered to refill it.

There was a Manager there who kicked some young children out of the bar, as you need to be certain age to be in there.  She looked like a B**ch and the way she handled the situation was very unprofessional!!

We paid for a room that was unavailable when we arrived.  They upgraded us to a huge, beautiful suite.

Only one bed so they promised to bring a ""roll-in"".  Despite reminding them, the bed never arrived and my daughter had to sleep on the sofa.

The room service meal was excellent but they failed to return to remove the mess and numerous accessories, despite calling them twice.

The in-room telephone is overly complicated and you need to be an engineer to figure it out.

The elevators are confusing,  some buttons work on the right elevator bank, others only on the left side.

So when we discovered we'd be staying at the Trump International Hotel after finalizing our Hotwire payments, we were stoked.  I mean, it's Donald Trump, right?

Three reasons this hotel's awesome:

1.  Smoke-free.  Yep, it smells more like expensive-perfumey sunscreen instead.  A welcome change, for sure.

2.  No casino.  If gambling in Vegas doesn't appeal to you, it's nice not to have to walk past all the dinging slot machines and people slumped over card tables every time you wanna get to your room.

3.  The mall.  Head out the front of the hotel and straight into Nordstrom.  Chipotle, a pizza place, and Johnny Rockets are also right there if you're hungry for cheap eats.  And trek to the other end of this monster mall and say hello to one of the largest Forever 21s I've personally ever been to.  Great (and dangerous) for buying new outfits if you're not crazy about the ones you brought with you.  Topshop is also nearby, which I had no idea existed across the pond.  And when you're walking back through Nordstrom on your way ""home,"" and if you're willing to spend $30 on makeup, they'll do your face for you ... great reason to have a cocktail before getting ready to go out!

Our ""studio suite"" had a full kitchen, TV in the bathroom, and a sofa sleeper in addition to the queen bed.  Every staff member we came into contact with was extremely nice and helpful (one who looked like Adrian Grenier even made several trips to bring us lots of extra toiletries), and the view from the 42nd floor was pretty sweet, especially at night.

A courtesy shuttle will take you to Ceasar's if you wanna get to the strip without walking or cabbing.  And Encore (great for a daytime pool party) and Wynn are just down the street, making for an easy walk to going-out destinations.

Overall, I highly recommend this place.  It's especially great for Vegas-goers who would rather shop and not choke on smoke while they're there ;)",0,1,0

I wish the hotel had a suggestion box because I think the elevators need to slow down. Our room was on the 46th floor and the elevator shot up and down so fast my ears kept popping and I was getting a bit nauseous. For Pete's sake... it's an elevator not amusement park ride! 

Our room had a King Size bed and queen size sofa bed. A Kitchenette with Cuisinart coffee maker, toaster, blender, stove, microwave oven, sink, fridge. There were also some cups, glasses, mugs, plates, bowls, pots, pans a salad spinner, kitchen towel, tea kettle..etc etc. I was surprised by all the closet space and the little living room area. Very quaint and cozy. The bathroom had a large stand up shower a toilet behind a glass enclosure, two sinks, a tub and a flatscreen built into the mirror! 

I really like the pool. The lounge chairs were cushioned, there were larger cushy lounge chairs with pillows, plenty of umbrellas, good music and a cafe, bar and restroom just steps away. What I didn't think was too cool was that the gym looked out on to the pool. Though it gives worker-outers something to look at I personally don't want to be stared at, but I guess you could move out of sight. 

BTW... There were Donald sightings in the lobby at 3am... so if you're a fan and want to stalk him... he does show up at his building.",7,5,4

The minute I stepped into the Trump Hotel, I was quite shocked. It's elegant and classy. There's no casino and it's bright with lots of glass and gold. It had a clean scent - no trace of cigarette smoke - and a friendly environment.

This hotel is definitely a place for people who want to come to vegas and enjoy a weekend, but don't want to be suffocated with the bad air and company. It's so classy, it makes me forget that I'm even in vegas. 

The rooms are nice and spacious. Each room is equipped with a kitchenette with a fridge\/freezer, stove, microwave, sink and dish washer, as well as dishes and glassware for your convenience. For an additional $50 a night, my party was upgraded to a bigger suite in which the bedroom was separated from the living room and there were 2 full (shower, sink, toilet) bathrooms (a master bath and one in the living room area). 

The perks? Free bottles of water in the lobby - just ask! And a shuttle that runs to Caesar's Palace every half hr and one to Wynn continuously until midnight. 

The downsides:
- valet parking only (it's free for guests, but you have to tip and it takes awhile to get your car)
- not much around - there's the restaurant and bar by the lobby, and a little giftshop, but there isn't really much else. You can walk across the street to the Fashion Mall though.

Kitchenette with FULL stove
salad mixer
dishwasher
the best coffee ever
dual sink in one bathroom
2 showers

big bars of soap

If you have the opportunity to stay somewhere else, do so.

This is the response I received after 8 months of communications.

Good Evening..., 

My apologies that you were unhappy with the offer to credit back your previous stay. It was not our intention for you in any way to feel that it was a dismissal. I did look into the option of offering a credit at one of the other properties in our hotel collection, but unfortunately we are not able to do so. I credited the charges that I offered on the day that I emailed you, but if you prefer I can certainly offer a future credit at the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas for the amount instead. It would be our pleasure to have the opportunity to serve you again. 

The Trump Family, although affiliated with our hotel, does not handle correspondences with our hotel guests. Our team of management has been appointed to handle the customer care of our guests.  We do certainly apologize for the challenges during your previous stay, and wish to have the continued opportunity to assist you. We value your feedback regarding your stay and are grateful for the time you have taken to detail your experience with us. I can assure you that we take careful consideration of how to improve our daily operations based on the feedback of our guests. 

Please let me know if you would prefer the credit to go to a future visit at Trump International Hotel Las Vegas, or if you would like for the credit that was placed on the card provided to remain. If you wish to return I will personally arrange your future visit, and I am confident that you will have an experience that meets the standards that you have come to expect from a Trump property. 

I truly hope that we are able to offer something that will work best for you. Please let me know what you think would be best. 

Sincerely,


This is the worst hotel.  It took 7 months to get a reply, and then it was never delivered to Trump Headquarters as requested.

Mr. Trump, this place is such a poor representation of your quality hotels, that you should remove your name from it, or clean it out and up regarding the building and the staff.  A lot of fishy stuff going on behind your back.  Don't know who is managing, but funny how I never heard from headquarters when I wrote the 3 page letter and then only heard back from the actual hotel 5 months after I wrote, and only because I chased them down.

I liked the no casino thing, I also liked the plain look of the place and the remote-ish feel of the hotel yet proximity to Nordstroms and the strip. The price we got it for was a steal

However, it appears others are having the same problems with  
1) screwing people on the resort fee.... I cant believe this has not been banned
2) My wife got the spa and was being overcharged until she questioned it.
3) Room service was a bit of a joke
4) Charging for wifi... This is nickel and dime stuff and really bugs me.
5) The business center charging for a sheet of paper  (one charge for B&W and a different one for colour) charging also for time spent.
6) A bottle of coke and a large 3 muskteers bar, 6:50ish? What? 
7) How about a pedestrian crosswalk to Nordstroms??

He sent us a check for the exact amount of my new flat iron (which I originally had paid way more for the first one). We got it a week later than when he said we would get it. 
We also contacted the BBB and complained to them about the situation. Apparently the guy who never returned our calls or e-mails before told the BBB that he could never reach us. WHAT A LIE!

The hotel kind of looks like a single tower Mirage stranded off the strip. The lack of self-parking does define a level of exclusivity above even the best of the on-strip resorts but with the lack of gaming and the awkward access, the place needs as much exclusivity as it can muster.

[first impressions]
The valet and doormen were polite and accommodating. The lobby was not grand but minimally decorated and finely appointed.  I waited for easily twenty minutes before being checked in (easily a source for minus 1.5 star). Seriously, I started walking laps around the lobby with my garment bag for exercise and distraction.

[the room]
[The rooms were pleasant, not super but still refined enough to exude some luxury. I was impressed by the shared entryway to the rooms. A unique feature in my limited resort-staying experience and definitely something that elevated the sense of luxury.

Local and toll free calls were no charge, which seems petty to note, but also demonstrates a sense of class (who charges money for something that is free in the first place?)

The bathroom was spacious and the in-mirror television was wonderful, even for a non-TV watching individual such as myself.

[Summary]
I mostly didn't spend much time in the room. For the most part it was a landing pad and a place to change in-between long bouts of vegas-party-lifestyle and I felt quite accommodated.  It's not faux-style, flashy; it's not trying hard to be part of the strip and with that, the Trump International Tower is a fairly laid-back, luxurious place to arrive and depart, rest your head and recuperate before taking on the vegas scene.

The lobby was elegant and shimmery. They have a lounge area on the other side of reception. The only thing is BEWARE OF THE ELEVATORS!! we were on the 36th floor and we could feel our stomachs everytime we went up or down. They defiantly need to slow down. 

The guy who checked us in said our room wasn't ready so he upgraded our two rooms to a one bedroom suite, with complete views of the strip. 

The rooms were amazing!!! we had a full service kitchen with real sized oven, microwave and fridge. This gave us the opportunity to bring our own food (saving us tons of cash). they had a nice size table to eat on and a big couch that turned into a queen size bed. There was also a nice size flat screen in the living room with a bathroom and good size shower.
The bedroom was huge! with two closets and drawers. the room and huge windows that faced the strip. great views. then comes the master bath....OMG. the bathroom was as big as some hotel rooms! they had a full on spa that we fit 4 people in jets and everything. and massive sized shower, two sinks and a tv in the mirror. it literally was the highlight of the suite. oh and they has this big window in front of the spa that over looked the strip too, it was awesome.

The only thing besides the room I used at this hotel was the pool. It was really nice and they have these awesome couches to lay on. Now that i think about it i actually really loved the pool area. It was really relaxing after a loooong night of hard partying. 

the only con was the $15 hotel fee and you have no choice but to valet the car and it takes a little while. but other than that it was a really good hotel.

I would most defiantly come here again. The rooms were awesome and the guest services were great! we even called in for blankets at like 4 in the morning and they came right away.

Oh and Donald Trump does check in on the guest too! He came by the pool Sunday afternoon and asked if we were having a good time :)",3,1,2

If you want beautiful, spacious room in a smoke free hotel in the northern Strip this is the hotel for you.  I LOVE the location - on the strip but not ON the strip.  The Fashion Show mall is right across the street so all the shops\/restaurants of the mall along with the Wynn\/Encore, Venetian\/Palazzo, Ti and Mirage are all a short (mostly) air conditioned walk away.

That said...everything was just a little off this time.  I usually visit for a longer than 'normal' stay and in the past when checking in I would get,  'I see you're with us for some time...can I offer you an upgrade' or 'I'm sorry, but we're fully booked over the weekend portion of your stay so this is best room available.'  This time, nothing.  And while the breakfasts are usually uniformly wonderful I had an off breakfast this time - the Eggs Benedict came back hard poached.  And previously when I put the 'housekeeping please' light I've always come back to a cleaned room.  This time I put the light on and left at 9:30 then came back at 3:00...to an unmade room.  At base, nothing horrible...just not the perfection of my previous visits.

Lastly, if you are travelling with younger guests, you should note that the hotel is no longer allowed to serve breakfast to people under 21 in their restaurant (because there is a small bar in the back). As an alternative, they have set up a 'to go' breakfast station in the lobby (and of course offer room service).",1,0,0

Ordered room service 3 days in a row for breakfast and it was great, very little wait for that busy of a weekend in Vegas.  The room was top notch with a full kitchen, huge bathroom\/shower that would of fit about 6 comfortably ;) and a 3 speed jacuzzi tub that my girl and I took advantage of everyday!   The only cons for some may be the lack of things to do inside the actual hotel, there is no casino and also no smoking (which I adored)  I believe there are only 2 restaurants\/bars on premise but the strip is right down the road and we weren't there to spend all our time in the hotel.

It came equipped with a dining table, bar top, full kitchen, 2 bathrooms, and bedroom, living (with pull out bed). The hotel provides cooking tools\/ kitchen ware when needed. The man that brought it to us was kind enough to offer more bottled water. (He came with a case.) I will definitely come back again and stay at the Trump hotel.

I give this place 4.5 stars because it's still no Encore.  However, I rounded it up to 5 because of great customer service. 

Booking a hotel for an all girl trip to Vegas was a lot easier than I thought.  Thanks to Travel Zoo's amazing deal, we booked Friday-Sunday for $99\/night for a Studio Suite.  It usually costs around $150\/night for these bad boy suites.  Keep in mind they have the annoying $20 ""convenience fees""  each night!  Regardless, it was still a steal!  Boy, I love Vegas.   

The Hotel: 
When we arrived, they only offer free valet service, no self parking.  What a great way to roll into Vegas.  We walked straight to the lobby and avoided walking through a parade of smokers and casino players unlike other hotels.  The lobby is absolutely gorgeous with glitzy lights, gold colors, and it smelled so good there...like potpourri.  They have a nice luxurious lounging area where people can wine and dine as well.  Yes, it is non-smoking and they have no casino. I actually prefer this just because of the quick easy access to the rooms and quietness after a night out in Vegas. 

The suite:  
We got the suite room which comes with a King sized bed and a pull-out queen bed couch.  It came with a European style kitchen so it had a mini fridge, stove, microwave, sink, and some dishes.  It was very spacious and the perfect amount of room for 5 gals.  The bed was comfortable but nothing like them Encore bed\/sheets ya know what I'm sayin?  They give two small complimentary water bottles but each additional one is $1.

The bathroom was HUGE. It came with a big shower area, toilet area, and a few amenities.  The only thing about the showers is it's slightly see-through. Hence, you can see blurry naked bodies if someone is showering or taking a poop. What a tease!  Highlights of the bathroom:  big tub\/jacuzzi and a cool snazzy tv in the mirror.  Never seen anything like that so kudos, Mr. Trump.   We made good use of the tub, it was extremely relaxing!  My girls and I slipped into our jammies, ordered pizza delivery, and soaked our poor feet after a night of dancing in painful heels. That's how we roll after a night of debauchery. 

Swimming Pool: 
This is probably the only downside to the hotel.  It was just a regular rectangular sized pool but it had nice lounging sofas and chairs out with waitresses serving drinks.  One perk is they have a gym and spa right next to it.  Free gym access for hotel residents! (That's where part of your convenience fee goes towards fyi.) 

Location:  
We made use of their free shuttle service to the Encore\/Wynn and Caesar's Palace.  Taxi cabs would cost around $8-12 depending on traffic as well, but split that between us girls it was definitely worth it.  It's also literally right across the Fashion Mall, haaaay! Very convenient for last minute clubbing outfits or to grab a quick bite to eat.

Customer Service:  
Excellent service.  I called and complained about a minor incident with my friend who had an encounter with security because her hotel key didn't work late night and they gave her a tough time since the room was under my name.  So security had to come up to our room at 5am to check my id.  Situation with security could've been handled better but I understand they are doing it for security reasons.   However, I called them up and a nice manager named Gerald was extremely helpful and offered an upgrade to a One Bedroom Corner Premium Suite next time I book with them. That's the way to do business! 

Downsides:
Only downside was you may have to wait awhile for valet and shuttle services to come around.  Also, we called room service for extra blankets, pillows, towels.  But they ran out of blankets! The hell? So my friends slept in the comfy bathrobe with the sheets.  At least they hooked us with tons of pillows and towels. 

I will definitely be back at the Trump Hotel, frolicking in a bathrobe in my upgrade corner suite next time!",7,5,5

First, the train noise that starts at or before 5 AM every morning. Not a great way to start the day. 

Second, there is no self park option. While I appreciate that some people like the convenience of valet, we do not. We often travel with classic\/show cars so this would not be a hotel we would utilize for those times.

Third, we booked this through priceline and it was a bit misleading as their site lists the hotel as on strip and it clearly is not. The hotel is not really convenient for walking anywhere. You have to either cab it or take the shuttle which only goes to the Wynn or Ceaser's.

Fourth, after spending the entire morning roaming the strip we wanted to go back to our room and rest for a while before our dinner reservations later that night. We get back at around 3. The room has not been cleaned yet. We call the front desk and are told it would be at least 4:30 before housekeeping gets there to clean the room but they would be happy to send us clean towels in the mean time.

Fifth, I decided to treat myself to a pedicure while my husband was at the pool. Nothing special about it. I could have and have had the same type\/quality of pedicure that I get regularly for 1\/4 of the price. 

While this is probably a great hotel if you are traveling with children or for business and want to be away from the strip but close enough for the excitement, it was not a good choice for us. We most likely will not stay here again. I would not rate this among the 5 stars that we have stayed in for past visits. Maybe 3.5 or 4.",2,1,0

I didn't want my fiancée to see me as I got ready for our wedding, so two full bathrooms with a whole separate area for each of us did the trick.  The TVs in the bathroom was a fun touch.

Thus, we actually PREFER a hotel with no casino in it. I got a Travelzoo rate several months ago for $109\/nt for a King Suite with a view.

When we arrived, check-in was VERY efficient and speedy. Our room was on the 55th floor and we had a view straight down the Strip. The room was spacious and had a well-equipped kitchenette (including Sub Zero mini fridge, Bosch microwave and Cuisinart toaster and blender). The bathroom had a huge marble shower and separate Jacuzzi bathtub, double marble sinks and a flatscreen TV INSIDE of the mirror! The furnishings are very clean and modern and the room felt luxurious.

The best part of the entire room was the bed! It was easily the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in -- IN MY LIFE! The front desk told me they are made by Stearns & Foster specially for Mr. Trump, but that he thinks something similar is available through the company. The sheets were high TC and the pillows and comforter were lofty and plump. The hotel also offers a 4 p.m. late checkout for no additional charge, which was perfect since we were out until 4 a.m. the night before.

My complaints are extremely minor: no call-down service for the valet (but the wait was usually only about 10 minutes), no free WiFi ($12\/day is a little steep and I felt it should have been included), no additional toiletries like mouthwash or toothpaste and the shampoo\/conditioner wasn't very high quality. Boyfriend also thought there should be some sort of rubber mat for the shower, since it was all marble and was very slippery once wet. My only other comment is that the lobby is a little bit gauche (but, it's Vegas...what lobby isn't?!).

All in all, I thought this was a FANTASTIC value and, as I said, the best bed I've experienced in my life. I will definitely be back.

p.s. in response to those who say it's ""off the Strip,"" it's not. It's on the older part of the Strip (near Circus Circus), but it's not technically ""off-Strip.""

I actually enjoyed not having a casino, you don't hear all the noisy machines when you are walking up to your room and are not as tempted to go gamble all the time.

If I was rating just on the hotel, it would be five stars...but the service was SO bad, I would never stay there again and neither will my friends.
Upon arrival, it was unclear that there was no self-parking. We mistakenly turned in to employee parking  (but realized it right away) and in our attempts to turn around we were chased down by an ornery security guard who talked to us like we were criminals. He then followed us out to the valet area and made references to our 'inability to follow directions' to the valet. I also did not appreciate the valet's mocking and sarcastic tone as he joined in the insults. I was ready to cancel my reservation right there.
Our experience checking in was great. The front desk staff was cheerful, friendly and fast! ....my mood changed. And, our room was beautiful-no complaints here. 
Headed to the pool...and BAD service. I waited in line for nearly 15 minutes to pay for a bottle of Snapple in the cafe. Although there were at least ten staff members behind the counter, no one would help me. When I finally flagged down a waitress, she acted annoyed that she had to ring me up. We were at the pool for about three hours and not ONCE did a waitress ask if we wanted to order drinks or food--we tried flagging someone down, but we were always told they'd 'be right back' and never returned. We were thirsty and hungry and had to walk across the street to the mall to get some service.

Pros:
Arrived as a group of 4. We had a late check in around 8pm, it was quick and the woman was very friendly. Each pair got a room with a king sized bed on the 25th floor. We had our rooms facing each other. We booked our room about a month in advance for about $300. 

The rooms are amazing! I like that it's a smoke free hotel and they actually make you sign an agreement to not to smoke or you have to pay the penalty fee. 

I love how spacious the room is (feels weird sleeping in my bed after spending a weekend sleeping in a king sized bed). The bathroom has a ginormous bathtub with jets along with a secluded area for the toilet and a huge shower as well. There are plenty of towels and a television in the bathroom mirror.

The cabinets have lights in them along with two very comfortable bathrobes. We ordered room service and the menu was affordable with a variety of food choices. 

The kitchenette comes with a stove, toaster, microwave, and a roomy refrigerator. They also give you complimentary water bottles and restock them after maid service. 

Saturday night we were upset to find out the pool closes at sunset but luckily Sunday morning the woman at the front desk allowed us to check out at 1pm for no additional charge! We spent our last morning relaxing by the pool and laying down in the nice chairs with relaxing music playing the background. 

Cons: 
There were some stains at the bottom of our bed sheets that grossed us out but we got over it. The hotel is right by a train station and we could hear the train blaring multiple times during our stay. I'm a heavy sleeper though so I'm not sure how many times it actually passed through.

Not only is it in a good area but it is one of the few hotels on the strip that is smoke free and doesn't have a casino inside which could be a good thing or a bad thing. Although the good thing about this is the whole hotel smells like suntan lotion which is a lot better than smelling cigarette smoke! 

I was offered a great deal with the trump were I had to go to a timeshare meeting so I got a killer deal on a 2 bedroom suite. The rooms are huge! Mine had a king sized bed, pullout sofa bed, living room, kitchen with subzero full sized fridge and freezer, and 2 bathrooms. The master bathroom was enormous and even had double shower heads which I fell in love with and there was also a washer and dryer. The trump also offers shuttle service to the Wynn and Caesars Palace but I found it was just easier to take a taxi since every time I tried to use the shuttle it was a long wait.

We notified the front desk that it was my birthday and they upgraded our room for free.  A BEAUTIFUL suite!  2 bathrooms, a full kitchen, a huge living room, and a spacious bedroom. The master bathroom was HUGE!  A TV inside the mirror, there was a stand in shower big enough to hold 4 people, a jacuzzi big enough for multiple people and a toilet with a closing door.

The only reason I won't give it a 5 star rating is because there is no self parking.  It's strictly valet, and it's annoying to shell out money tipping the attendants every time you need your car.

But considering the upgrade for free, I can't complain considering that we booked it through Hotwire.com and got a great price.

If you like tranquillity, this is your place.  It's off the strip, so there isn't much foot traffic. There's no casino attached, so you don't have to get plumes of cigarette smoke hitting you as you're walking through the lobby.

The good...it does not have a casino, so it is not nearly as crowed and busy as the other places in Vegas.  When you walk into the Trump you can smell the amazing aromas of well, bamboo, others are calling it flowers because they can see all of the pretty huge flowers in the lobby.  However, if you go into the Trump gift center they sell the scent sticks that they use to scent the lobby.

The elevators are super fast, and everything is clean.  One weird part about the room is that you have to go thru one super heavy door in the hallway, then they have two separate rooms from this tiny room.  So your door is right next to another door.  So when you are sleeping it is easy to be awakened by your next door neighbor.  

The rooms are really nice and big, the beds are not the most comfortable but okay.  The rooms come with kitchenettes but no plates, or cups, or silverware, you can boil some water, and put it into a disposable cup that is it.  The bathrooms are nice, they have big jacuzzi tubs, big showers and a tv in the mirror.

There is a train that runs by at like 3 something in the morning, you can definitely hear it.  I had earphones in a few nights.

Our first morning housekeeping, which was nice,  was there at 8:25 am, weird.  We kept running into them as they would come to our room at different times thru the stay.

The pool area was nice, it looked like it could have been vacuumed tho.  The chairs around the pool are comfy but are all stained and look worn.  They have round beds next to the pool which nobody uses and they charge extra to lay on one of those.  Also the pool area is really windy, even though it is hot the wind was a bit much.  The pool staff was nice and always checked to make sure you did not need anything.

The hotel is a bit off of the strip and is a pain in the foot to get back in forth between them and society.  The Trump shuttle is lame, I think they only have one shuttle bus, so you could be waiting for upwards of 30 minutes for it to pick you up from Caesars.  When it is over 100 degrees, waiting for that long just doesn't make sense, so you end up buying a lot of taxis.  The taxis charge you an extra $3 or $4 to use your CC.

Overall, there were some inconveniences about this hotel, I do not plan on making any return trip to Vegas anytime soon, but considering the cleanliness of the Trump I would probably stay there again over a cigarette smelling casino hotel.",0,0,0

Okay...that's out of the way.
The hotel was decent.  Not overly impressive especially by Vegas standards.  Room was clean.  We had an upgraded room.  The lobby had the most hideous floral design I've ever seen; looked like twelve year old got distracted by something sparkly passing by and gave up on the whole thing.  Considering the opulence of the lobby, the floral design just stood out like a half-assed sore thumb.
Bring a slip resistant mat for the shower because they must clean the tile with a zamboni!  Shaving my legs was like a near death experience and the shower didn't drain.  Additionally there was the strangest toilet arrangement I've ever seen--the toilet was enclosed in a glass partition and shared a glass wall with the shower!  So if someone was showering one could use the toilet and see into the shower!....what the deuce?!  What cracked up perv came up with that idea?  It was beyond creepy...like Someone with a real hunkering for fetish porn and ice rinks designed the bathroom.
Room service????----forget it!
It took our friends THREE separate orders for just decaf coffee to get delivered correctly!  We ordered room service after the concert and we were told it would be less than an hour to get it and almost 90 minutes later it was delivered and it wasn't delivered with a cart and he plate covers were taken away so there was no way to put our dishes into the hallway when we were done so we awoke to the smell of our late night dinner.  The pizza is made on frozen pre-made shells.  Drinks and food were the most expensive we'd had in Vegas and none of it was that good.

I was impressed when I walked in. We didn't have a strip view but it was a nice view nonetheless. The room was huge. I wanted to throw a party just because it was that big. I walked into the bedroom and noticed a used condom wrapper behind the door since I closed the door to change. Gross right?! This hotel is close to a bunch of adult entertainment places so people choose the trump for that reason as well.

My husband and I were staying at T.I when we heard the news that our Hotel spa was under renovations and was referred over to Trump International by our cabana cocktail waitress.  Loving Trump and so close to our hotel, we decided to go.  Made reservations by phone pretty easy to accommodate us that day.  However, on the phone the receptionist quoted a price for a couples massage. I was fine with the quote that she gave me over the phone so I proceeded to book.  

     As we arrived the hotel lobby is beautiful I do love the color gold.  The massage itself felt really rushed and not relaxing at all.  For the price I believe an hour would have been more worth the money, not 45 min I mean I was expecting something spectacular for the price, Hello. it is Donald.  Coming to an end leaving the spa of course our therapist tried to sell us there products making us feel uncomfortable, and boy was the product expensive.  Last, but not least as I was going to pay for the couples massage my quoted price happened to be a lot higher than the one on the phone.  I almost didn't ask why, but this was a different price than the one the receptionist quoted earlier.  I just decide to be that girl and ask. It's a good thing I did,   I would have  dished out 60 extra bucks.  Well that 60 bucks extra was the gratuity the workers decide to add on last minute.  Didn't bother leaving it up to you the person paying.  Most importantly didn't explain the charges as one should... Receptionist annoying!  Please don't try and sly people out of there money.  Some other person would have not asked why because they are polite and the sleazy balls would have got a way with this cheezy scam.   Byeeeeeee donald.",0,0,0

The hotel is very nice and most of the staff was wonderful. Rooms were beautiful everything was clean and fresh. A little further from the strip then I thought it was but they have shuttles and it's an easy walk to get to Wynn or Encore.  So the reason for only 3 stars:  
1. No outside food or drink at the pool. Well I can understand the policy, I don't have to like it. For one, last year I stayed at the mirage and they had no issues with this.  Second, one morning I saw two girls with McDonalds cups at the pool while I was at the gym. 
2. The dryer in the bathroom didn't go to high.  It was either medium or low. I don't know if that was just mine because luckily one friend brought her own, so I didn't bother to call the front desk about it. 
3. This one is kinda scary.  I ordered a drink while at the pool Sunday afternoon.  When I was almost done I notice something sliver in the drink. To my amazement, it was a staple.  I'm still trying to figure out how it would even get in my drink. I didn't see my waitress so I took to the employees passing out towels. They were very apologetic and the girl took my drink to the bar manager.  She came back and told me that they were very sorry and that they were making me a new drink and comping my drink from our bill. She assured me the waitress would be out with my drink soon. I didn't want to make a big fuss because I'm in the travel industry and I know things happen. But i could have been hurt if I accidentally swallowed that staple and, to top it off, it took forever to get the new drink. Seriously, I thought I was pretty nice not making a bigger deal but to take forever to bring me a new one just kind of annoyed me.",0,0,0

Pros:
Friendliness of the staff! From check in to check out, they were unbelievably accommodating and friendly. 

Amenities in the room. Full kitchen (which is the reason we booked there to begin with. A lot of places in Vegas do not have a kitchen). It had a sink, fridge, toaster, stove top, tea kettle, microwave, Keurig coffee maker, and cabinets. As a nice touch, they had Rio Blend coffee in the room. Maybe because of the 2016 Olympics coming up? Also had paper coffee cups, sweeteners, creamer cups, and stirring sticks. Due to county regulations, they are not allowed to keep plates, silverware, etc in the room but will bring them to your room if needed. 

They also included an iron, ironing board, blow dryer, light up mirror, bathrobe, and plenty of fluffy towels. 

The bathroom has a TV inside the mirror. Didn't use it but interesting touch. Spa tub and separate shower. Marble counters and floors. Water heated up VERY quickly. 

The pillows!!! Oh the pillows! I have to find the Downrite brand online or in Macy's or something because they were divine. Beds were comfy too. 

Our room even had a DOORBELL on it instead of the bellboy knocking, he rang a door bell! LOL

The AC was amazing and cooled the room quickly and kept it cool. 

Very quiet. We never once heard any other guests. All the appliances in the room were quiet as well. 

The elevators. Fast. Ya know how some hotels you stand there forever waiting on the elevator? Not here. I timed it. It took 13 seconds to get from the 39th floor to the lobby. Unreal. 

The ice machines are in their own little rooms in the hallways so you don't have to listen to someone getting ice in the middle of the night. 

It is right across from a huge mall. Lots of shops and a large food court. 

Cons:

The train. Yes, you read that correctly. There was a train that ran behind the hotel where our room was facing that ran every couple of hours throughout the night and woke us up each time. As it came up to an intersection, it would blow its horn over and over. But this is where the nice staff came in handy. They were more than willing and helpful to move us to a room facing The Strip in exchange for a small extra fee because it was a room facing The Strip. We could still hear the train in the distance but not enough to wake us up. We only heard it before heading to bed. 

Valet. Yes, I know that valet was supposed to be bougie and helpful, however, we found it bothersome. It's just easier to have access to our car when needed. On the other hand there was a relatively short wait time so it wasn't too bad. However, that depends on your timing. Some times of the day were very busy. 

Internet. It was a bit slow. So if you are someone there on business who needs fast internet for work, this may become an issue. 

Sleeper sofa. We pulled out the sleep sofa that our original room included. For a 5 star place, there should be a nicer one. It was just your run of the mill, feel every spring, mattress. 

No casino. For me personally, this was not a problem but if you going to Vegas to gamble, this may be an issue for you. 

Not on The Strip. The only reason this is a issue is because of the heat. If you want to go out and walk The Strip, you also have to add to that walk because you have to get from the hotel to Las Vegas Blvd. It's not too far but the heat is what does it.

The good:

* Our room was very spacious and luxurious.  Everything was in top notch condition and full of amenities.  Nice bed, big closets, flat screen TV, lots of phones, a couch, nice wood paneling, high ceilings, big windows, etc.  It was as nice as the room at the Wynn and better than our Bellagio room.
* Our bathroom was even better.  Huge shower, separated toilet stall, double sinks, flat screen TV built into the mirror, big ol' tub.  To me, bathrooms are the real test of great hotels and this was a good one.
* It has that certain Trump style, if you've ever been in one of his other properties.  I would call it modern gaudy.  All of the gold and glitter but its done in such a sophisticated and modern way.  Let's be honest, the guy knows how to design buildings.
* I liked the pool area.  It's just a simple pool deck with a fairly large but uninteresting square pool.  Yet they had a live DJ doing a serviceable job with fun and loud music.  The crowd was acting like adults -- no ridiculous debauchery or nasty skanks.  Just a pretty laid back, nice looking group.  The table service was good too.
* I had a problem with my key one night -- at the time I was alone -- and although security showed up slowly, the extremely large man was quite professional and really made me feel comfortable that I was safe (I was afraid that I had been checked out and someone would come into my room in the middle of the night with a key).
* The restaurant, DJT, is amazingly a Michelin starred restaurant.  I say amazing because the staff never even told me of its existence, much less that it has a coveted Michelin star.  My room service was excellent, at which time I looked up the restaurant on the internet and found out about its star.
* Oddly, not having a casino was nice.  It calmed the place down and made it feel more comfortable as opposed to the constant hustle of a casino.

The OK:
* It's a better location than people give it credit for but still not all that central.  You can walk right across the street into the Fashion Show mall and Nordstrom.  That's good, because the hotel is surrounded by empty lots and the hulk of an abandoned development nearby.  Fashion Show is a nice mall and gives easy walking access to Wynn, the Palazzo\/Venetian and Treasure Island.  Still, its a $10-15 cab ride to most other major strip casinos like MGM or Bellagio.
* The front desk staff was efficient but it all felt a bit odd.  It's a five star hotel selling themselves off at three star prices (which I appreciate, granted).  It was almost as if the front desk staff was slightly despondent about the bargain hotel shopping.

The bad:
* The lobby has a pretty lame bar.  The singer on Friday night was dreadful -- like the guys who get booed off the stage at Showtime at the Apollo.
* The resort fee of $15 per night, which is mandatory but a surprise.  We paid $142 per night on Priceline -- which was pretty good when the best other deal available was TI at $125 or MGM at $210.  It was a reasonably busy weekend and other five star properties were all north of $250 per night.  But the unexpected resort fee was a huge insult and honestly should be illegal.  It felt very beneath a five star property to hide such a fee -- gave me the feeling that Donald himself was chuckling at my expense.  If I had known this going in, it wouldn't have been so bad.  But it was the one thing that left a bad taste in my mouth about the hotel.

Summary:  Great hotel.  Average location.  If you can get a good deal, go for it.   However, next time we might pay a bit more to be more central on the strip so we don't have to pay all of the cab fares.  I'd say the cab fares plus resort fee added $60 per night to our stay.",0,0,0

The hotel is very tastefully decorated throughout from the rooms to the lobby.  It's very stylish with clean modern lines.

Large shower and huge tub. Loved the TV in the mirror feature.  The one detail that caught my attention right away was the wonderful aromas as you enter the lobby.  The soap and shampoo in your room is the same scent.  It's so lovely.  There is a shuttle that will take you to and from the Wynn and Caesars Palace that is really helpful.  Of course there is no casino but I honestly didn't miss it.  It's not on the strip but you're so close to the strip that it never posed a problem for us.

The living area is hugely spacious and super comfortable, makes you want to actually stay in your room the whole time there.  We ordered room service for breakfast (gotta try the sausages, they are the BEST!) and for late-night snack (hummus = delicious!) and both showed up within the time frame they promised.

Bottom line: killer value! I stayed here for $109 a night on the weekend and for what you get, it could have easily been $200+ anywhere else. The lobby entrance is fancy but not over-the-top, with a large space but pretty straight forward design between the front desk, lounge, and restaurant areas. The pool is just alright, nothing special, but does the job if poolside isn't going to be one of your main destinations while in Vegas. Our room was one of the basic spaces offered, but it had plenty of amenities and was beyond comfortable. I'd say the highlights are, the huge bathroom with large vanity, shower, and separate jacuzzi tub, and the kitchenette that allows you to have all the functionality of a small apartment even for just a weekend stay. I've found myself wishing at EVERY nice hotel I've stayed at since that they had that kitchen. The bed and seating provided are all comfortable and the room was very spacious. The only reason I'm giving the Trump a four star rating is because of it's location. This is Vegas after all and it's at the end of the strip, so taxis, and a bit more walking were in order. The hotel is a five in my book though, and if you don't mind the location, then it's well worth it.",0,0,0

Gladly we we're still having lunch in the area and we're able swing by the hotel to retrieve it from reception. Rooms are really nice, clean and odor and smoke-free. Noisy train passing by though! I didn't give it a 10 because toiletries are incomplete. At the poolside you will have to get up your lounge chair to order and wait at the H2Eau bar for your drinks since no server goes around that time. No help or assistance for assembling the umbrella.

The only reason it did not get five stars was because its out of the way location on the North end of the strip. The thing I really appreciate about this place is that its a respite from Vegas. There is no casino and smoking in the hotel. At least for me, its nice to come back to a place after a hard night of partying where I can relax and get away from it all. 

The rooms are gigantic. I've stayed at many properties on the strip and the standard room is much bigger than anything I've ever been in. The bathroom is equipped with a huge soaking tub and there is even a TV embedded in the mirror so you can be entertained while brushing your teeth. 

The room only has one bed, so that could be a problem if its being split amongst a group of friends. There is a sofa that can be converted into a bed for extra sleeping space. There is also a kitchen with a stove and microwave, but personally I can't ever imagine anyone using it. I just can't see people going to the grocery store and getting food, and in the process skipping all the great restaurants in Vegas.

The staff were polite, always. However, it was very apparent that the politeness wasn't always genuine, and became more genuine depending on the apparent value of one's attire.

Trump's location is just awful. They have a shuttles, but awful is still the best word for it because sometimes you don't want to wait for a shuttle - or wait for the next shuttle when one is full. All parking is valet, so keep plenty of small cash for that if you have a vehicle.

I'll sum up pricing with this: Including tip, I paid $20 for a Sapphire martini at the lobby bar. I expected it to be high, but even I didn't think they'd charge for a small bottle of Sapphire to make one regular-sized martini.

The clientele seemed to comprise mainly Jersey Shore rejects and guys trying to impress girlfriends \/ new wives with their vast ability to accumulate debt. I suppose it gets a star just for the people watching value.",0,1,0

If you get the $80 special from priceline...well you deserve to hear the train blow at night. 

As for me.....priceline special. I definitely heard the train but only when I was awake. It never woke me up. 

The bathroom was phenomenal, room nice enough. What I hated is that you could not get a coke anywhere other than room service after the gift shop closes. I don't mind the occasional $5.00 soda but room service would have run me over $12 for the soda. 

If you are in Vegas for gambling...I would rate this place 2 stars. It is a pain to get back and forth to other casinos besides the Wynn. If you are there for shopping....this place get 5 stars as it is next to one of the best malls I have ever been in, in Las Vegas

After being out in the heat and having to deal with the shittle from the airport, Julianne L and I were very happy to be at our destination. The lobby was beautiful. Bright, and clean. Since Trump Towers isn't a casino, you don't have to deal with the noise and crowds. It's nice to have a quite place to come back to. After checking in, we went to find out suite. 

There are two separate banks of elevators. We were staying on the 50th floor and I can tell you that the elevator can be a ride all on its own. Your ears will pop and your stomach would drop a little. Each suite shares a corridor with the adjacent suite. You have to open a set of double doors before you can open the door to your suite.

The suite was HUGE!!!! There's a king size bed, and a pull out couch. You can easily fit 6 to 7 people in there, no problem. There's a mini frige and coffee maker and a flatscreen TV. That's pretty standard. There's also a stove, pots and pans, plates, glasses, and utensils too. That's something I've not seen. Oh... and my favorite part, there's a blender!!! We are so pre-partying and bringing our own booze next time. There's also an ice machine in the hall so definitely no worries there. The bathroom was great. There was a whirlpool tub. A shower stall and a toilet stall. There were double sinks and the bathroom was big enough to have 4 to 5 people in there. Did I mention there was a TV in the mirror? The MIRROR!!!! 

After resting for a little bit, we decided to go to Rio for their amazing seafood buffet. We ask for a taxi at the valet. The guy said that it would be at least $15 for a taxi and since nobody is asking for the free shuttle to Treasure Island, the shuttle can take us to Rio. We can just tip the driver. That was really nice of them. The driver was a wealth of information too. He gave us plenty of Vegas tips. That night we also asked for more towels and toiletries. Room service showed up with a stack of about 6 towels and a plastic bag full of shampoos and conditioners.

Julianne Z. found this place on priceline and got the suite for about $120 a night. That's nothing!!! There is a resort fee of $25 when you check out though. I wouldn't hesitate for stay at the Trump Towers again. The experience was amazing. Expensive, tiny casino\/hotel resort rooms be damned!!!",2,1,2

From the moment we arrived, we were treated as VIP guests (which as poor graduate students we are not). There was a short line of people waiting to check-in (5-7) which I was perfectly fine with when out of nowhere came a hotel employee who offered to check us in at the VIP counter around the corner. (Who were we to deny his request? Ha.) While checking-in, we asked for available upgrades; for a $50 upgrade fee, he put us in a strip-facing 60th floor giant 1-bedroom (2 full baths) suite with full kitchen, living room\/dining room. Did we need all of that space? Obviously not. But boy was it nice to have. Moral of the story: ASK for an upgrade and swing for it, too. 

Common complaints about this hotel (with rebuttals):
(1) Far from the strip: Lies. It's approximately a 3-5 minute walk to Wynn and Encore down the street. PLUS, there is a free shuttle to the Wynn, Encore, and Caesar's Palace that leaves every 10 minutes and runs until midnight. 
(2) No casino in the hotel: Is this really a complaint? There are a gabillion (a really large number) casinos in Vegas. Don't you want to come back to a quiet smoke-free sanctuary away from all the hussle and noise of any casino right down the street? Yes. Yes you do.
(3) Resort fees: ALL Vegas hotels have resort fees. 

My complaints:
(1) The bar closes early and service at the bar could be improved. 

My compliments:
(1) FREE shuttle that runs until midnight; Use this. 
(2) Great lounge chairs by the pool
(3) Fast, efficient valet service built into the resort fee
(4) Wonderful staff; I was walking to the elevator and remembered I needed some  extra drinking glasses in my room; when I approached a maid with her cart, she said that would be no problem. When I tried to tell her my room number, she said she already knew it. Impressive.
(5) Substantially cheaper than all other 5-Star strip hotels regardless of who you book through",4,4,2

When the woman arrived to deliver the food, she handed me the bill to sign and i left the tip line blank and mentioned to her that it was bc the tip is already on the bill.... she then said that she doesn't get any of that tip and usually people tip her too.

To start it off, when we checked in, the front desk couldn't find the reservation. An innocent mistake due to a mistyping of my complicated last name, but it kind of set the tone for the rest of the stay. When my partner and I got to our room - a beautiful view over the river, I'll confess - though the bed was made, it looked like someone had made copious use of the bathroom before us.

I called housekeeping and Jose came up promptly and was incredibly apologetic in cleaning up the mess, but come on - if we're paying this much for a room (well, actually, my grandmother is paying, but still), I expect to enter a clean room with fresh towels.

And finally, the gift bags that my grandmother had given to the hotel to distribute to the guests somehow never made it up to me.  Maybe due to the name mis-spelling on the registration, but whatever the reason, it took me 45 minutes at reception to actually collect this with maps, details for the weekend events, and the like. The receptionist was actually arguing with me that they didn't make any mistake... until they realized they did.

Though the weekend overall was wonderful in reconnecting with family, the accommodations left a lot to be desired in customer service and cleanliness. Won't be staying here again.",1,1,0

I thought that the hotel was on discount sites because some people do not want to do business with the namesake. A hotel is a hotel to me! The good: excellent service, all room service is guaranteed to be delivered in under half an hour! The room service food was delicious. Tip: order a kids meal for certain items (chicken tenders) the portion is HUGE and it is half the price of an adult entree. There is 24\/7 security at the entrance to the elevators so you don't have to worry about your room being broken into (yes that does happen at other places in Vegas).  There are cold towels at the gym and pool as well as free bottled water everywhere imaginable. The jaccuzi tub was amazing! Cons: terrible pool area with no shade, towels were hung sloppily, if you use the kitchen you have to call down for pots and pans (weird NV law), some shampoos and other toiletries were not replaced without requesting it.

I pricelined this hotel under the category  ""5 star hotels and resorts"" and got a great deal.  When I arrived via Taxi (which was about $26 from the airport) there were not enough valets to help with my bags.  The lady who checked me in though was very nice and explained the resort fee to me (wifi, unlimited water, etc is included in the resort fee so the ""free wifi"" description is deceiving).  

Now for the hotel itself... on the way to the elevators there's a vestibule in front of the gift shop.  On the wall opposite the gift shop was a mirror that had water spots or something all over like it needed a polish or something..  my first impression.. what's going on?  In the hallways to the rooms (I had a friend staying on the 26th floor) there was stuff like crumbs\/ trash all over the carpet and this stayed there all day.  In fact some of the carpet was ""stretched"" creating rolls on the floor which can be dangerous because someone can trip and fall on these ""rolls"".

On to the room... I stayed in room 2312. When I walked in the room I noticed that it is similar to the MGM signature and various other hotels on the strip with a little kitchenette.  After I started to look around, I noticed that the shelf under the tv was split. In the bathroom the frame of the large mirror right above the sinks were filled with old toothpaste spatter and some other random things in the crevices which made it kinda gross to stare at while washing my face and brushing my teeth.  What was ultra weird was when I went to take a shower there was a crumbled ALMOND.. yes, the almond nut that you eat, at the edge of the shower floor right below the door.  I left the almond there to see if housekeeping would clean it the next day.. but nope... the almond was still there the next time I took a shower.  The hot water the first night took about 15 minutes to get warm. The shower handle was loose so if you pulled a little bit,  the handle would disengaged from the gears and you couldn't turn on the water.  For the two nights I stayed there I never once had even ONE bathroom floor mat.. while my friend had two in his room.  When I got into bed that first night and moved the decorative pillow I noticed on the back side had a huge hole near the bottom of the european pillow case. 

Also, the first night some idiot rang my doorbell for 15 mins at 1 am.  Because of the two door system, I was afraid to go outside the door of my room into the tiny vestibule to look out the peephole to see who was the a-hole, because I knew that they would hear me come out of that room and might create a scene if I didn't open the outer door.  I guess I could have called the front desk and had them send someone up to see what was going on but at this point I really didn't want to move out of my bed.  

The only redeeming thing about this place was getting a discount on priceline.. however, I hope since theTrump staff knew I was a patron who got a room via a third party payer that was NOT the reason I was in such a crappy room with crappy housekeeping.  

Unfortunately, I have no plans to stay here ever again.  To me and now to my friends, this place will be affectionately known as the Trump Dump.",4,4,1

Rooms were clean and updated and had tons of amenities like great products and wonderful clean tub and great standup shower. When we asked for extra towels and a toothbrush they came quick and were friendly. 

The pool was great. Not busy and there was plenty of chairs. We stayed August 2014 for the first time and that's their busy season but yet we still didn't have any issues at all. They let us take one of the big lounge chairs for free that they usually charge for and even brought us some fries. 

All in all service was great. Pool was great. Room was clean and quiet and had everything you could need including a kitchenette that was very useful. 

Also loved that they were right across from the mall and just off the strip. They had a shuttle service to major points around the strip but were still very close to anything we could need.",2,0,1

The front desk service was great, they upgraded us to Strip views. No charge; we merely mentioned we were exhausted. And the rooms were far and above the usual rooms (MGM, Planet Holleywood, Mandalay Bay, not to mention the lesser hotels such as Luxor). Great, plush furniture; coffee in the room; fantastic views; and a flat-screen television. The kicker though: A TV in the mirror in the bathroom! Finally the treatment I deserve; a man's lavatory should be his castle. 
Yes, you can't gamble at the Trump. (In Las Vegas, does anything say class than not being able to gamble at your own hotel?)

The staff was on point from check-in to check-out.

Stop by and see Marcus downstairs at The DJT, he understands what customer service is all about!

The rooms are all suites.  They are beautiful and spacious with very comfortable beds (if you are allergic to down, you might want to give them a heads up). Bathroom has a flush-mounted tv in the mirror to watch from the jacuzzi tub.  The toilet and shower have glass privacy doors.  The room is also equipped with a safe to keep your jewelry and game winning under wraps.

Ask for the strip view! I was on the 51st floor and was able to watch the fountains at the Bellagio and see the fireworks at Treasure Island.

The Trump doesnt have a casino.  I am an avid poker player, but I have to admit that I liked that the absence of gaming in the hotel.  Getting in and out is easy as you dont have a never ending maze of slots to navigate.  I spent my time playing at the Wynn, which is a very short walk from the Trump.

Next time I am in Vegas, The Trump will have my business again... assuming I can get another good deal on a room.

The rooms were exactly what you'd expect for a 5 star, Trump hotel.  Beautiful, elegant and plush.  The bathroom was FANTASTIC!  The bathtub was soooo big, my husband and I could have fit 1 more person in it with us :-p.  Plus it had jets that had 3 settings.  My hubby also REALLY liked the fact that there was a TV in the mirror, he has requested one in our new home, HA, as if!  Only a couple of minor downsides to the bathroom, the glass doors are super heavy and slam easily if your not careful (I though I was going to break them), and the shower head was too small and not enough pressure.  

The robes were AWESOME, super soft & only $125 to purchase, not much more than nice robes @ department stores.

The loss of a star was for the staff.  They were inattentive and short handed.  In my experience, a hotel with a 5 star rating should have the HIGHEST level of service!  I realize that the hotel is newly opened and therefore working out the ""kinks"" however, this is not Trump's first hotel and therefore the staff should be prepared before opening.  By 3.5 months into operations, you'd think they'd have it worked out.  There was no taxi line and only 1-2 valets who were running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  People were when they got the valet's attention, not who got there first.

The gym was well equipped and we made use of it.  We just walked in & started working out, after a while, a staff person came by to ask if we had signed the waiver before working out, he said when we were done we should sign it & it would also give us full access to the spa facilities.  As we went to sign the waiver, we noticed in small print at the bottom that we would be charged $22 dollars\/person.  Since the desk wasn't monitored, we didn't sign & didn't use the spa.

One more thing, the pool is not very big but there are lots of lounges & half canopied daybeds.  The cabanas, however, are not finished and will not be done until next year.  The pool also looked a little dirty, due to the construction I'm guessing.

We booked on Priceline so we got a great deal.  I would definitely stay there again, for the right price.

As I mentioned, the train was a huge issue for us, we stayed on the ""mountain"" side of the hotel, so we got loud horns every hour, sometimes twice an hour when the train passed through the street intersection.  The train horn is LOUD and pressed several times for probably one full minute, which was like getting an unwanted alarm clock at 3am, 4am, 4:40am, 5:20am, etc.   When checking out, we were told we can ""upgrade"" to the ""Strip side"" which doesn't have the train, but we'd also have to pay for it.  Really, we need to upgrade to get sleep??  

Housekeeping service was a smidge slow when we asked for dishes (since most rooms have a kitchenette with nothing inside, not even drinking glasses), the pool is very small for the size of the hotel, and each time we went down (different days, off times, you name it), the entire seating area would be full or would have exactly one seat available. There are two jacuzzis, both are VERY small, and of course, one was not in use during our stay.  Keep in mind the elevators really hum\/ cry during the night, so you may want to avoid a room too close to the elevators. 

Now the positives! Overall, the staff were very professional, courteous and quick.  The prices for room service were some of the most inexpensive I've seen on the Strip, and the food quality was very good.  Free valet parking (as all hotels have in LV) and there's no smoking anywhere in the hotel (HURRAH!!).  There's no casino, which was a perk for me, and it's in walking distance to the Fashion Show Mall, the Wynn, the Encore, etc.  The location worked very well for us & if there were no trains (or triple paned windows), this would've been a hotel I would come back to.",2,0,0

We booked a spa day at their spa on premises and it was amazing!  That was money well spent.  Their on site restaurant was gourmet all the way.  We felt like royalty!

I came here with a large sponsored group over the weekend, so everything was complimentary, so I can't say anything about money value of this hotel.

The lobby\/public area was very clean and spacious. Gold as far as the eye can see.
I loved the mini suites with the kitchenette and REAL fridge. Not one of those mini 'bars' with $10 bottles of water and $15 bags of M&M's. Too bad realistically, you won't be cooking anything at all here. The bathroom was amazing with the built in tv on the mirror (perfect for bumping music while getting ready for the night!). Separate HUGE bathtub. Shower head had the weakest pressure and sprayed water unevenly. 

Beds were very very comfortable and we had a great view of the strip. Unfortunately there is ZERO reception in the room\/hallway. My phone was basically useless unles sI went into the lobby or was out on the strip. Also, the wifi never connected!

The pool area is huge! We missed it, as we came too late. But one of the roaming guards was nice enough to let us go outside anyway and dip out feet under the cold vegas sky and take pictures! How nice! He also gave us a hint on how to get to the rooftop, but the door to the roof was locked when we found it :( Thanks anyway random nice roaming security dude!

My 2 biggest pet peeve about this hotel was the elevator and the fact that it doesn't have a casino. I knew the casino thing before coming, but the problem would arise from the fact that we would be on the strip, and some people would want to go back to the room. We would have to take a taxi or wait for the shuttle since the hotel is off the strip. Because I wanted to save money, I would hitch a ride back with my buddies. But once we were at the hotel, I realize I actually wanted to gamble some more and there was nothing I could do unless I wanted to walk back to the strip in my painful heels or hail another $$$ cab.

The elevators were annoying! They put my group on floors 31, 34, and 35. The elevators split at floor 34. So to get from my room 31 to my friend's room in 35, I would have to get on the first elevator to get to floor 34, get off, walk down the hallway to the next one, and take that one to 35! The first day we were so lost and confused it took forever to even find our friends. The worst was when I had to travel from floor 35, take an elevator, grab our friends on floor 34, take a new elevator to 31, grab our stuff, then 1 more to the lobby. 

Confusing? Yes indeed.

But in the end, it is a great hotel with minimal problems. But for vegas purposes, I prefer being on the strip with a resort\/casino.",9,8,7

My hubby decided I needed a nice little weekend getaway and one of our favorite spots is Vegas.  We found a nice deal on Travel Zoo and stayed for two nights on Friday 3\/2\/12 and Saturday 3\/3\/12 in their One Bedroom, Premium Corner Suites with a view of the Strip.  LOVED OUR SUITE!!!  We were on the 47th floor and our living room and bedroom windows sat facing the Palazzo, Wynn and Encore!  

Some of the things I loved about the Trump that separates itself from the other 5 Star Hotels in Vegas is that their suites offer more privacy, peace and quiet.  In order for you to get to your suite, you have to go through double doors, which lead you to a small hallway, that leads you to the door to your suite, thus ensuring that you do not hear people slamming their doors, or walking\/talking up and down the hallways etc. etc.  I love that each suite has doorbells, so that you don't have to deal with people knocking on your door.  Also, as opposed to the old school style way of placing a sign on your door to show when your room is ready for housekeeping or if  you want privacy, the Trump goes high tech.  In each suite, there is a key pad that you simply press when you need housekeeping or want privacy.  This in turn is reflected on your room number out in the hallway.  (Please see my pic for reference).  

Our one bedroom corner suite totally rocked.  It had a really nice kitchen equipped with a Sub Zero fridge, dishwasher, stove, tea kettle, coffee maker, complimentary bottle water, martini shaker, blender, microwave and toaster!  All the comforts of home in a 5 star hotel I tell you.  I loved that we had a roomy living room with a comfy couch and flat screen TV.  Our suite also had two bathrooms (with showers in each).  The master bathroom was AWESOME!!!  HUGE!  With a nice window facing downtown Vegas from the jacuzzi tub!  The jacuzzi tub btw, was huge and could easily fit two adults!  :) Perfect to have after spending a night on the town!  The TV in the  bathroom mirror was a nice touch by the way.  Double sinks, huge shower that can fit like 4 people.  

The bedroom had lighted double closets and a large, super comfy king sized bed and a sitting area.  I loved how the bedroom had windows that wrapped around the room where we nice views of the Strip and downtown too.  

Service was friendly, but slow at times (especially valet).   The gym was small, but efficient, clean and well kept.  The hotel itself is non-gaming, non smoking and the  air is perfumed.   Another plus is that the hotel is located directly across the street from the Nordstom's entrance of the mall.  :)

Would I recommend?  YES!
Would I stay again?  Without a doubt!

So, we settled down in the room, view was the back side which is whatever to me. Didn't really need a view. Anyways, my boyfriend wanted to turn on the tv in the bathroom and realized it was broken! Another problem, while sleeping, it felt like the window was crack open, so my boyfriend went to check and realize the window was broken as well ! So, throughout the night, there was an annoying wind noise which sound a bit creepy and just damn annoying. Next morning, my boyfriend complained, so they sent up someone  to fix the tv, and he said it can't be fixed unless he gets another tv set from another room. And the window was taped to prevent the crack. WOW?? We were a bit furious, so my boyfriend complained and requested to switch rooms, and they said there is no rooms available. Which was weird, because we told the guy that was fixing the tv to get a non-broken tv from another room. SO there were rooms available!!? 

Never coming back again. I walked to the strip the first night we arrived. It wasn't a long walk, but it was so windy, I ended up eating sand and dirt during my walk. Didn't appreciate that, so I decided to take the taxi after that experience.

I called the front desk to report that our alarm clock\/stereo did not work and was told that I might not be able to get it replaced with a working one...wtf?  We were charged extra for our service fees.

Even when they fixed it, it worked only one day. This is just too important to not address. But wow, the room was phenomenal and the service was great as far as getting us exactly the room we requested months in advance, thank you Rebecca :)

Last year we stayed in a basic room facing the strip (please see my previous review, I am rather proud of it and it's very detailed!). This year we stayed in the 1 bedroom corner suite facing the strip. Not only were we facing the strip, but we were facing the good side of the strip (ie not the hills, not circus circus, but the nicer hotels). We could see the entire strip and were only 2 floors down from where the penthouses start. 

Because it was a corner bedroom, the views were panoramic, and floor to ceiling high windows everywhere, including in the 2 bathrooms. Yes, TWO bathrooms. One bathroom was huge and the other was, well, ginormous. Even people with 5,000 sq foot homes don't have as large a bathroom as the main bathroom here. There were TV's on the mirror as there are in all the rooms. 

We loved the full kitchen and had fun cooking our food from Vons Grocery delivery. Not only did that save money (banh mi $18 on the trump room service menu!), but we ate exactly what we want, how we want it. 

The bedroom was large, how nice it was to wake up to that incredible view, glass all around you. At nighttime it's even more incredible. The living room and dining room is great if you want to entertain. It's about 1,000 sq foot total. If you got into any of the penthouses, its a similar floor plan but even bigger, especially the living and dining area.",12,6,5

My King room is very spacious and well appointed. Bathroom is huge with a built in TV on the mirror which is a nice little extra. A few things you should know. Everyone was very friendly and the room is very clean.

1. This hotel is off strip. But a free shuttle will take you to Ceasars and you can navigate the strip from there.

2. All hotels on or slightly off strip have a resort fee. The only one or two I know of that don't are ridiculously priced anyway. It doesn't matter if you book your room with the Trump reservation desk, Priceline or any of the other places....Vegas is all about resort fees...get over it.

3. This is a non gaming hotel...which means no casino. While I love to gamble it is nice having a break from all the casino noise and traffic.

4. Check-in can get crowded. Again this is Vegas so there are a ton of conventions and misc events that bring in heavy traffic during the summer months. Look how big the hotels are...expect to wait. This isn't the Marriott in the middle if nowhere....this once again is Vegas.

5. Hotel is non smoking. Go outside to light one up.

6. I see people complaining about additional coffee and tea needed for their room. Since I travel extensively for business and pleasure my advice is to take stock of the towels and tea\/coffee when you first get to your room. Ask for additional at that time and not when you are trying to get your coffee fix on. Once again look at the size of the hotel and understand that you do not have a butler to fetch your coffee in a time you feel is appropriate. 

7. Internet speed. Can't tell you as when I'm on vacation I don't watch TV or use the Internet. 

8. AC is fantastic. It's about 110 degrees outside now but my room is ice cold. While you might not think that is important; trust me some other hotels on the strip don't even have digital thermometers and cool setting can vary greatly.

9. In the event you arrive early and your room is not ready you can pre-register and leave your bags with the bell desk. Then go explore! The hotel will call you when your room is available and there is a separate line to just pick up your key. The front desk will have your luggage delivered to your room. Please be sure to tip the porter. $2 minimum per bag upon delivery.",3,0,0

As for the pool, great low key atmosphere with music that is not overwhelming or too loud.  The wait staff is a little slow, but that's probably the only complaint I have.  The pool area offers reserved day beds with an umbrella that are complementary if your tab is more than $75. Yes, only $75.00. For our party of 3, that was a no brainier...

Downstairs there is a gift shop with lots of snacks.  The restaurant has fantastic breakfast food.  It was about $30-40 for 2 for breakfast.  The standout was the french toast croissant that is really a dessert and the belgium waffles.  The hotel gives you bottles of water each day.  The hotel pool is enormous.
There is free valet only parking for the hotel.  It is across the street from a large shopping mall Fashion something.  A free shuttle service is offered that takes you to the Wynn or Cesears Palace, running every 15 mins.  Fast free wi-fi in rooms.

It's off the strip, but right across the street from the mall which is convenient. It really isn't far away from everything. I appreciated the price I paid, which was $110\/night, and for last weekend, it was a steal compared to everywhere else, but the saying ""you get what you pay for"" came into play after my Vegas trip came to an end.

I'll go ahead and say that the rooms are plenty big for a couple. The best example I could think of is it being the size of an Elara suite, just one of it's king size bedrooms. It comes with a hot tub which is HANDY for long days of walking & clubbing. The door entrances are separated from another door outside which allows for privacy. These were good things I found worked for this hotel.

There were definitely more dislikes however then there were ikes.

One thing I disliked about this hotel was that there was no self parking. You have to valet it, and I don't trust how people drive my car. When we left, someone's car got hit, and they were doing paper work for it. It's just an example of ish that could happen and if you want to drive it around you have to tip the driver just to be courteous.

Another thing was that the hotel was close to the train track. How about investing on some sound proof windows? The train horn can be heard every time it passes by, and over the weekend at night it happened at least 2-3 times. Very annoying.

You also will be charged a $25\/resort-fee + $3 service charge I think. Why? I don't know. Hotwire tells you after you purchase which is BS. They say it's so you get free access to the WIFI, the workout center, and you get free water.

The pillows were also too soft for my liking. They would get to flat once your head laid on it. Having two just raised your neck waiting to be woken up to a cramp.

I will go ahead and tell you why i didn't give it a 5 star rating first and then go ahead with everything i loved about it. When i got there (not a busy day) there was a line with a 10-15 minute wait to check in, and the day i left  (a busy day) was even longer. and when i did check in, there were no rooms ready and i had to wait 45 minutes for it to be ready. So I'm not sure what was up with that but it didn't start my stay well. 
Once i got to my room i was pleasantly surprised at how nice it was for the price of a hotel with no casino. There is a mini but complete kitchen, great views, spacious room all over, and very clean. 
No i don't eat out often and especially with the prices you pay to eat out in vegas. So i needed to find a grocery store  to stock up on food for the 4 days i was gong to be there. I called down to the concierge desk and i have to say Ricca who was working that day was absolutely amazing!! she went above and beyond to help find me the cheapest and quickest ride to a Trader Joes a couple of miles away. After that experience i was hopeful ;-)
I didn't spend a ton of time in the hotel as i was there for a convention but i used their gym every day and it has everything 95% of anyone that works out would need.
The pool is very luxurious with servers, a pool side bar with a food menu as well.
I did go to the restaurant in the lobby for a drink one night and breakfast the last morning. The bar tenders are very good and make wonderful drinks, their breakfast was delicious and the service is A++

I'm pleasantly surprised that it's not. Its off the strip, no gaming, no smoking environment, much like the Vdara's relaxing atmosphere, but more classy. If I had an upscale apartment, this would be it. 

Guest suites come with a fully furnished kitchen (utensils, stainless steel appliances), custom furniture, pull out sofa bed, built in cabinets\/drawers with quiet self closing feature and a huge marble bathroom enough to throw a party in. (you can put 3 people in the tub and at least two in the shower)

The Sealy & Foster bed is comfortable but the pillows are too soft for me.  I do have to rag on the fact that some of the furniture is showing wear and tear and there are visible stains on the carpet so keep those slippers on. (of course I had slippers on, I'm Filipino, I bring them with me on trips!)

The pool area is nice with palm trees lining the wall, views of the Wynn and Encore hotels and 2 hot tubs on either end. For fitness buffs, you can choose from 6 different smoothies on the menu and even add protein powder for $2 bucks. 

Before you think this hotel isn't Vegas-ey enough for you, just keep in mind that there are 50 penthouse suites here and the gold gilded windows of the tower is actually made with 24 karat gold and cost a cool $20 million.

My wife was looking for the best 5-star hotel deal, and this was it. 

I've browsed the reviews here and they all seem very accurate. The service we received was wonderful, the rooms are beautiful, the location is perfectly fine. I'm glad we didn't have to walk through a (smoke-filled) casino to get to our rooms. Nice to have a fridge (no mini-bar), complimentary (Wolfgang Puck) coffee and bottled water, dishwasher, microwave oven, and cook-top. One of our rooms even had a blender. We learned all rooms were designed to be condominiums, hence the amenities, but there are no rooms with two beds. However, each room does have a sleeper sofa, so there are two places to sleep.

A few details worth considering:

A package room will most likely get you a ""city view"" room, which is to say looking north or maybe even west (bad), not south down the strip. My wife read complaints about the city view rooms. Worried about this, she managed upgrades for $20 a night (on the phone, before we arrived). When we arrived, we were told this is normally a $50 upgrade. We had four rooms, 2 with south views (down the strip), 2 with east views (we saw more of Las Vegas Blvd. as it went north). Since there are so many other elevated places to see the strip from, seeing it from your room was not that big of a deal. 

Trump is partnered with Treasure Island. When we checked in we were offered 2-for-1 tickets for Cirque du Soleil's Mystere (which is at TI). If the offer is available, I suggest you take it. There are restrictions, but it really would have been a good deal, even considering we already had tickets for O. 

The pool closes early. Maybe this is a Vegas thing, but we were getting booted at 6PM. At the time we wished we could linger longer. We were told as summer approaches, the hours will extend to 7PM, and then 8PM. In retrospect, we should lounge by the pool in the morning, and experience the strip at night. 

Trump International Hotel just started (the week we were there) a shuttle service that will take you to the strip. This is just a quick run east on Dio Drive to the corner of Dio and Las Vegas Blvd. S. It only runs to midnight, but it will save you a bit of walking and get you very close to the RTC Deuce bus stop (buying a multi-day pass for the Deuce is one of the first things you should do). Depending on reception (and comments from the survey you will get in the e-mail), they may extend the service. 

If you don't want to wait for the shuttle, and the Fashion Show (mall) is open, walk across the street, into Nordstrom's, and walk through the the mall toward Neiman Marcus (and TIX 4 TONIGHT) to get the strip (near Treasure Island). 

If you are going further, or to a show, check with the doorman. On several occasions we managed a private, and complimentary car (a black Chevy Suburban) to take us to our destination. A tip to the driver, and the doorman (important) will almost ensure this service is at your disposal. 

For $30 you can get a limo to anywhere on the strip, including the airport. These guys are just waiting around, and if a car is available, they seem to be happy not to be idle. For parties of 4 or more, it's a better deal than a taxi. Again, just check with the doorman.

Checkout is at 11:00 AM, though you can request a late checkout which moves it back to 4:00 PM. 

Lastly, you may be surprised by the $15 per night per room resort fee. This seems to be a Vegas norm, or so I was told. It covers access to the pool, but also a complimentary (daily?) shoe shine (so I made sure I got my monies worth). There may have been a few other things (newspaper maybe, there were several to choose from, I went with the local paper), but I don't recall for sure. 

Bottom line. Great place to stay. If there were not so many other places to stay and things to try in Vegas (maybe next time it will be a station casino), I would stay here again.

[update] I think Dio Dr. is now Fashion Show Dr.",9,2,3

Although the Trump is at the end of the Strip (Near the Wynn), it was not that far off. Located across from the Fashion Island mall, this hotel is the the definition of classic elegance. 

My friends and I arrived in Vegas around 11am. Although check-in did not begin till 3pm. We tried our luck with the front desk and was notified that a room was not ready. We left a number and ventured across the street to the mall.

When our room was ready (30 minutes later), the 1 bedroom Strip View suite was perfect for the 4 of us. Having two bathrooms in the suite made getting ready less hectic. The main bathroom in the bedroom was spacious and the tub looked amazing! For 4 girls, there was not enough countertop space. Unlike The Palms Place, you have to request cookware\/kitchenware from room service. It did take about 15 - 20 minutes to receive the items. Also, I thought it was kind of the front desk to call to see if we receive the items requested. Cell reception was a major problem. My friends and I had terrible reception on the 51st floor, and we had T-mobile and Verizon.

This hotel is valet only. When I left this Sunday morning, I didn't have a problem with waiting too long for my car. However, I did leave at 7am.

Overall, this is a great hotel if you're looking for calm and nice retreat from the strip. I say it is an affordable hotel and greatly accommodates large groups. From now on, I believe my Vegas days will be spent at the Trump Hotel. 

Resort Fee: $28\/day (besides the usual, this fee includes two small water bottles\/day in your room). I spent $253.00 with taxes for one night. I was in Vegas during Cinco De Mayo weekend and there were two big fights this past weekend. So the prices were higher. Normally you can stay at the Trump for less!",5,2,3

Not a square inch of shade, and lounge chairs practically on top of each other. 

From the layout, it would seem that half of the rooms have spectacular views of the Strip, something I was looking forward to, as I brought all my camera gear. Unfortunately, my room had a view of the sketchy parts of vegas, as well as the train tracks. So disappointed.

We stayed at Trump for a whole 7 nights, so we had a chance to interact with about every position besides those at the Spa. 
At check-in the place was VERY busy, and though the valet area was just packed they had it well managed and directed. We were greeted by the valet and a bellhop who were above friendly especially considering that madness going on in there, and though we don't valet or even stay at hotels often they made the process simple and explained what to do next.
The line at the check-in was very long but went relatively quickly. Our checking host was very nice and because we mentioned we were there for our anniversary she offered a complimentary upgrade from our lower level ""city view"" and we ended up on the 54th floor facing right center on the strip! Wow that really made our stay above amazing.
Our room was beautiful and though it wasn't as goddy or immaculate as I had expected from trump it was classy and clean. I was a bit surprised at the low quality of the living room area furniture, but the couch was a hide a bed, so that was a bonus (we didn't use it, but good to know for the future) and the bed was very comfortable, and there was tons of storage closets and a full kitchen including a little two burner cooktop. The kitchens aren't stocked but you can call down for flatware if you need it.  They also give you 2-4 water bottles everyday (with housekeeping) and some days even gave us 6.
The least impressive feature of the hotel is the pool area. Though they have ample seating and the grounds are beautiful it is just a bit of a disappointing pool for Vegas, I've stayed many places in Vegas and this was the most basic. That being said it still worked out well, they also have 2 hot tubs, and a restaurant boarders poolside and you can be waited on for food and drinks all day if you like! 
The hotel also has a free shuttle that goes to both the Wynn and to Caesars palace, the Caesars one is nice too because it puts you right in the middle of where the hotel\/casino meets the Forum Shops mall. The shuttle drivers were very nice, though we did wait at the Wynn on one occasion for over 45 minutes (it is supposed to run every 15-20 min depending on the day\/ time) because the guy apparently took a lunch break and there was no other driver. That wouldn't have been bad under normal circumstances especially since the hotel is only like a 10-15 min walk away anyway and you can even walk all inside of the Fashion Show Mall, but this day was the first day there and due to the heat and because I didn't drink enough water I was suffering from bad heat exhaustion, and was in a lot of pain and needed to be in bed.
Housekeeping was excellent and did a great job at cleaning even with our babies messes all over the room. We also got Room Service a few times and the food was pretty good, nothing to write home about but tasty and easy. We also checked our car in and out of valet several times and they were just wonderful every time.
On the second day we came back home to a nice fresh fruit, dried fruit and nut platter, a couple of Fiji Waters and a very nice hand written note from the hostess who checked us in wishing us a happy anniversary. 
I cant say enough how the best thing about this place is that they do not have a casino inside or smoking. You get all of the benefits of Vegas without the downside of having to maze through a casino to get to your room, all while getting a nice case of second hand smoke induced cancer. Additionally because of the free shuttle service you can get to the best parts of the strip quickly and easily. 
The Trump has made me a customer for life, and I will be staying exclusively with them any time I go to Vegas. I was a bit worried about not getting the whole Vegas experience (especially since this was my wifes first time there) while being off the strip, but first of all it is not that war off the strip. You can get to the Wynn or Palazzo (which is the base of the strip) within a 10-15 min walk at most, and even walk it all indoors in the mall across the street. Or cut through the same mal to the skybridge over to Treasure Island again 10-15 min tops. Second of all, as mentioned above, the free shuttle to Caesars really opens up the whole strip to you. 
Furthermore it is actually kinda nice to be a bit of the hustle and bustle of the strip, and I would highly recommend giving the trump a try for your next Vegas trip. You can get a great price by naming your own price on Priceline which will more than likely land you here if you choose 5 stars on the Northern Strip.",1,2,0

My only complaint would be the cost of additional services such as room service food. Granted room service is intended to be pricey, but this is Las Vegas.

PROS: Quick check in and fast elevators to 37th floor.
      Excellent light lunch in lobby restaurant.

CONS: 1.)$25.00 ""service"" charge PER NIGHT for double beds.
      2.)One waste basket next to tub, none in the room.
      3.)Cell reception was non-existent in room thus lobby calls for any contact. 
      4.) I left some items in the Valet parked car, when I asked valet to bring the car around ( literally 10 minutes after parking at 2:45 in the afternoon ) they said I can WALK WITH THEM TO MY PARKED CAR TO GET MY ITEMS. I did go with them and called the MOD(manager on duty) to voice my displeasure later that day. He defended the action until I stated..""IF I WAS D. TRUMP WOULD YOU HAVE HAD ME GO TO MY CAR???"" GOOD POINT was his response...We have nicknamed the property ""DUMP""
5.) Pool closes at 8:00 pm( WHAT???...This is Las Vegas not senior retirement center.
6.) Waste baskets were full and rarely clean.
7.) TV in bathroom mirror had HBO but large HDTV in room didn't..weird.
8.)$25.00 per day , per room..""resort fee"" covers wifi..Motel 6 has FREE WIFI and coffee.
9.) $5.00 coffee in lobby ..should be FREE.

I pounced on that deal like Lindsay Lohan pounces on lines of coke that ""mysteriously"" appear on the table. Yes, it was THAT good!

Upon entering the lobby, I was enveloped with such pleasant scents and a cool and calm environment. If only all Vegas hotels were smoke-free. You felt like you weren't in Vegas anymore. There are no annoying slot machine sounds or douchebags that look like they came from The Jersey Shore. There is actually a major sense of normalcy here. I like.

Our room was one of the studio rooms that make up the majority of the rooms at this hotel. Our view was less that spectacular...unless a view of the Erotic Heritage Museum across the street is your cup of tea. I should have taken up that $50 upgrade for a better room from the person at the front desk. Ah well. Our room was very clean and actually pretty spacious. The TV incorporated in the mirror of the bathroom was a very nice touch. The shower is gigantic! You can easily fit 4 people in that thing. Much like the lobby, you get a relaxed state of mind in your room. I likey.

Yes, there's a mandatory resort fee at about $20. I got a chance to use the pool, but not the fitness center. The pool was pretty standard. There were a lot of kids roaming in and out of the pool, but I wasn't surprised with the type of crowd for this hotel. I must say though that the waitresses at the pool were very appealing to one's eyes. I likey a lot.

The Trump is a very good alternative if you don't want to deal with the hustle and bustle of other busy hotels. I would strongly consider coming back here again.",2,6,2

But I found myself Hotwire-ing a place to stay in Vegas for a summer weekend, and of course I waited until about 2 weeks before. So our options were limited and expensive. Fortunately, I've gotten to a point in life where staying at places like Circus Circus and the like are unacceptable. Trump Hotel became our most reasonable option on the north end of the strip.

There's a few things that stand out about staying at the Trump Hotel. There is no casino. I'm sure this is by way of not being able to attain a gaming license rather than by choice. For someone like me who doesn't care to gamble, having a casino in my hotel isn't a deal breaker. On the upside, when returning to the hotel from elsewhere, it's a straight shot to the hotel elevators and you don't have to walk through a long, smoky casino. That being said, it is a no smoking facility. Hooray for the non-smokers and a breath of fresh air that I usually don't get while in Vegas. 

Parking is valet only. This one I am impartial to. I don't mind self park, especially if it comes free. If you have a car, you will be taking it to valet. There is also a free shuttle van to both the Wynn and Caesar's Palace. They run about every 15 minutes. On our weekend we happened to make plans to go to XS and Omnia, so this worked out perfectly for us.  

Bottled water in the rooms were complimentary and when we checked in, they encouraged us to come to the front desk for more if we needed. Seeing as I don't think temperatures ever dropped below triple digits the entire weekend, extra water was definitely needed. 

The room itself was spacious and clean. We had a room with a King and pull out sofa and a kitchenette. The bathroom had a bathtub, shower, and double sink and was also really spacious. In general, luxury is a good word to describe the amenities within this hotel. Our room faced west so our view was of the 15 freeway and Palace Station. 

I didn't have a chance to check out the pool or fitness center, although I was wishing I had more time to. I also didn't check out the gift shop. That one I have less desire to see.

Checkout time was originally 11 am. We were able to extend it to 12 pm for no extra charge. Thanks for a good stay and the extra hour to recover!",12,3,5

i have to say, i was a bit disappointed.

there are a few pros to the hotel: non-smoking, no casino (if you want a quiet environment), mini kitchenette, bottled water, nice bathroom w\/bathtub and cool t.v. in mirror.

otherwise, the room itself didn't meet my expectations.  when i had booked it online, i thought i was getting a ""city view"" of the strip.  and that was the name of the room when i had reserved it.  unfortunately, when we had checked in, i was told to get the actual city view, it would be an additional $20.  huh??  so we also heard that stupid train during the night..... ugh!

the kitchenette was nice and convenient.  only... our fridge was never cold and the coffee maker was broken.  on top of which, one of the bedside lamp switches were broken too.  bummer.  i called the front desk and told them about the problems in the room.  but no one ever came while we were there... granted, it was only one night.  

the bed itself was a little too soft and cramped for my taste.  if you have a bad back like me, the soft bed mattress cover isn't for you.  and the outdoor pool was a little bit smaller than i expected.  

if we had a choice, i probably wouldn't go back.  i thoroughly liked the encore hotel a lot better.  sorry, mr. trump.   :T",1,0,0

Maria, the housekeeper took great care of us & even asked my husband if we needed anything extra for the baby, just don't look under the bed, not pretty.

I personally loved that there was no casino or smoking inside, it made it easy to travel with a baby. But don't try to change a baby diaper in the lobby bathroom, no changing table, so the hotel is like 3\/4 baby friendly, it is however dog friendly. So that's cool.

Everyone was super helpful though, thank god. complimentary valet and shit outside and the standard ""may i help you with your bags?"" BUT NO ONE EXPLAINED THE ELEVATORS. There are two elevators. One that goes up to like the 30th floor or something and another that goes up to the 60 something floors. We lived in the 63rd floor. so confused for a little bit..... 

Anyways, we got the penthouse suite... and oh my god, it was beautiful. double doors, walked into a pretty amazing living room with a nice ass tv and a fULL KITCHEN complete with an oven, full sized fridge, microwave, sink, stove, pots and pans, utensils, dishes, and a freaking coffee maker. AMAZED. two bedrooms on either side of the living room. One of them was a master which had a queen(?) bed, walk in closet, two toilets, a shower, a nice hot tub\/bathtub with jets, and two sinks\/mirrors (that you could watch tv in it). The other room was just about the same, but one of everything but no walk in closet or bathtub. and all in gold and white scheme.  
You get free wifi, and new bottles of complimentary water (SO NECESSARY) every time you finish and the maids come to clean. and chocolate! and fluffy towels and bath robes. Their alarm clock comes with a dock for iPhones (not for iphone5) and you can play your music and blare it while youre getting ready and pregaming! 

Now, i didnt really get to experience the other stuff they had to offer inside the hotel, they DO have a free shuttle to from the hotel to the Wynn. AND when we were late on Jan 1st to Light and there were no taxis coming anytime soon, one of the workers offered to drive the hotel car (Escalade) to Light for us and we would just pay him aftewrwards. He gave us his number so we could get picked up without any hassle after we got fucked up too ! perfect, no wait for taxis either. 

Although it is slightly off strip, you can walk across the mall (which is acrosst he street from Trump) to get to the strip. It'll take you across the street from the Wynn or if you walk a little farther, just a few steps to the Venetian. I had a really really really amazing time at the Trump, even though i dont really remmeber much, but i will miss the comfortable beds and even more soft pillows for my raging hangover",6,6,5

I checked in on Saturday during memorial day weekend, waited 30 minutes to try to valet park my car and failed to get on the porte cochere due to mismanagement and understaffed valet crew.  There is no excuse for that kind of thing at a hotel especially where there is no self park option.  Ended up parking across the street at the mall to check in, ridonkulous.

The service at the front desk was good to great, they were apologetic about the valet and whenever I called down for my car (once I was able to valet my car), they fought to have my car ready by the time I got down.  Accommodations are decent, nice big jet tubs, good sized rooms and a mini kitchenette in the studios to boot because these are condotel units.  The location, despite being off strip, is workable because you're walking distance to the Wynn and directly across the street from Fashion Show.  If you're staying here, you probably don't want a casino and so being next to fashion show is a plus.  

I can't stress how understaffed this hotel seemed to be and so I probably won't stay here again if I'm paying the same price as a on-strip 4star hotel.  I was able to book at a $100 discount to other comparable hotels with a casino though so something to keep in mind.",0,1,0

5 stars. North on the strip. Excellent deal. Condo.

Alrighty, where should I start this review. Stayed here from Thursday night - Saturday afternoon. 

Basic Info -
No casino. A resort. Mini stock kitchen ( stove, fridge, pots, pans, salad tosser, glasses, you name it). Grand luxurious bathroom with a jacuzzi. Comfortable bed and warm cozy sheets. Sofa easily converted to a pull-out bed. Right behind Palazzo and Venetian.

Service -
When it came to delivering hotels and glasses, it was definietly lacking. Waited 5 hours for some glasses. Waited 1 hour for towels. Along with numerous follow-up and reminder phone calls. Definetly disappointed.

Security -
BIG MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. 

Friend #1 got super wasted and did not have the key to get into the room, so calls Friend #2 to call the front desk and ask for security to open the door. Friend #2 does not know who's name the hotel is booked under or any information such as credit card info, address, etc. After numerous attempts on guessing the address and slowly reading my cell phone number off her phone, front desk allows Friend #1 to enter the room. 

Granted that it was my friend and they were staying with us, you guys really need to enforce security and ensure the safety of your guests. It should be much more difficult, if not impossible, for anyone to be allowed into your room without the actual check-in person's consent. Had it been a complete stranger or someone else entering our room, you guys would've been in MAJOR TROUBLE. Extremley disappointed, Trump.",2,1,1

Vegas is a place to splurge -- that goes without saying. I know of people who are willing to spend up to $500\/night on top-notch hotels. I found a deal for a 5-star hotel for $133\/night on Hotwire on the North Strip fully aware it was probably going to be the Trump -- I doubt the Wynn would offer a room at that price. What I would get was worth every penny.

The service is absolutely incredible. Everybody was super friendly and helpful. I had a bottle of alcohol spill in my suitcase and they told me what I needed to do.

The Donald had this hotel covered in I believe 18-carat gold. That's right, he covered the exterior of this high-rise hotel in gold. It's a bit much, if you ask me, but the Donald does not fool around. He means business.

There's no casino attached to the hotel, so everything is nice and quiet.

The rooms are palatial. They come with a microwave, fridge, complimentary bottled water, and a large bathroom. I sunk right into the bed in my room. Easily the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in.

The views from the hotel are absolutely breathtaking, too.

My only complaint is the location. It's off the strip about 1\/4 mile across from the Fashion Show Mall, but they have complimentary shuttles to the Wynn and the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace to eliminate a lot of the walking you'll do.",2,2,1

There is not really any gambling at this hotel and is meant to just stay and relax, which we did.  The accommodations in their suites are nice, but not overwhelming with electronics or special lighting.  It is meant to spend family time for recreation and be shuttled to the various casinos or shopping centers within a few mile radius.  The best thing about the Trump is its proximity to the shopping mall, where your anchor stores pull in much of the shopping.  My favorite is the Nordstroms, which is literally across the street.  My only gripe is that it's valet parking only, which is complimentary, but you really have to tip these guys and gals, as they live off the tips.

The bathroom was my favorite part- HUGE! We basically had a glassed in room for the toilet; large, walk-in shower; and even a TV built into the mirror. 

The negatives: Breakfast was not included; however, I believe that is normal for Vegas.

I also really liked that our hotel was just that...a hotel! No smoky casino, restaurants, or shopping. A nice change at the end of the day.

Cut to 2015...it's not so shiny and new any more.   MOST of their staff is still awesome.  We had a perplexing encounter with a rude valet - my husband spelled his last name for him and the valet leaned over and yelled ""WHAT!?"" with a tone of annoyance - but thankfully we never had to deal with him again. 

We've stayed here twice in the last 4 months because for the most part they are still very nice rooms and a good value.  Unfortunately, we've also noticed that things are breaking down...lamps don't work, blow dryers don't work and irons don't work.  Though service requests are fulfilled promptly, it took us 3 tries to get a working blow dryer and on our latest visit, two tries to get a working iron.  Grr!!  We didn't even bother with the bedside lamp.  

We also noticed a dirty glass in our bathroom...the bottom of the glass was coated with white...and it's supposed to be clean? Ick. I didn't quite feel the same after that.

The general feeling is that some of the rooms haven't been touched in a long time, hence probably why they aren't aware when something stops working.

Yes, I stayed at a hotel owned by someone who I think it's safe to say I didn't vote for in 2016.  Why did I give my hard-earned money to He Who Must Not Be Named?  Because despite his antics (both in the White House and on Twitter) the guy gives damn good hotel; I've stayed here several times before, and have never regretted the experience.

What brought me here the first time was the fact that this uber-luxury hotel has no casino, and doesn't allow smoking.  While it's on the Strip (just barely) it's still decidedly off the beaten path.  That said, it's walking distance to both the Wynn and the Fashion Show Mall; the latter provides lots of shopping options, as well as a good number of places to eat and drink.  

Tip: The Trump provides a complimentary shuttle to Caesar's; there are also enough Uber drivers out and about that all you need to do is request a ride using their app two or three times and it's better than even money that you'll actually get picked up before your driver cancels ;-)

The check-in staff is very attentive and really gets the job done right.  I called ahead to request an early check-in, and while they didn't guarantee it, they made it happen quickly and painlessly, even though I arrived at 11am on a Friday.

The rooms are clean, really large and well appointed; there's lots of room to unpack (if such things float your boat) and the bathroom is massive!  In my double-queen room, there was both a hot tub and an extra shower.  There's also a kitchenette in the regular rooms, and a full kitchen in the suites.

As my only excuse for coming to Vegas this time out was R&R, I found time to use both the gym and the pool.  The former is very nicely equipped and well maintained; the latter isn't as big as some hotel pools I've seen, but the lounge chairs are comfortable, you don't have to mortgage your soul to get extra towels, and the curb service is excellent.  What more could you ask for?  About the only down side of the pool area at the Trump is it tends to get VERY windy; makes it difficult to read anything that's not electronic.

To summarize: Leave your politics at the door, and you won't be sorry about staying at the Trump.  It can be loads of fun to gamble at the casinos on the Strip when you feel so inclined, but when you're tired and ready to call it a night, it sure is nice to come to a place that doesn't force you to spend 20 minutes breathing 2nd hand spoke while you wind your way through a casino to get to the room elevators.",20,18,18

If you are visiting Las Vegas do not pass up spending a few nights at the Trump Hotel. From the moment you walk in you are treated beyond belief. This is a first class hotel with everything you would ever want in a room. The décor is second to none in the lobby and in your room. Your room will consist of a complete kitchen with a sub-zero refrigerator, microwave, oven, etc. You get the idea, it has it all. The amenities are boundless. High speed internet, courtesy shuttle to the Wynn and Ceasars Palace, evening turndown service, in-room coffee and bottled water (which we loved during the hot weather) replenished daily and unlimited local, domestic long distance and toll free calls to name a few. We love our President and wanted to be able to say we stayed at one of his hotels and were so happy we did. This was one of the most beautiful rooms we have stayed in a very long time.

pros:

-amazing customer service (concierge, room services, valet attendants, etc.) 
-non-smoking establishment so it doesn't reek of cigarettes
-no casino (a plus because you don't get these drunkards\/stragglers wandering around)
-all their rooms are suites with a single master bed
-flush lcd tv inside the mirror
-whirlpool tub
-small kitchenette
-complementary shuttles to the strip: every 5-10 min to the fashion show mall and hourly trips to the forum shops at caesars with return pickup!

- LOTS of outside noise from rail line.  clearly no double glazing 
- Not a lot of hotel amenities
- Pool closes at 8
- Too far to walk to the strip, and not a safe walk at night, no lighting and no sidewalk for most of it

Some of the highlights that make this stay more than comfortable are:
- Shuttles to the Wynn and Caesar's Palace (super convenient)
- No casino, smoke-free
- Free valet (don't have to worry about parking)
- Customer service is amazing (call for more water\/tea, and they call you back asking you if you've received it)
- Quieter, less partying than others I think
- Right next to the Fashion Show mall!

Aside from that, my stay in the actual hotel room was also amazing. The bathrooms are really the highlight. So large, clean, and new; there's even a TV on the mirror in case you really wanted to watch TV while taking a shower\/bath.

But this also means that there are limited food options, namely the main restaurant with Trump's initials DJT, and a crappy poolside cafe.
Like a lot of Vegas hotels, this place charges for everything where they can: The resort fee is $25 a day, to rent a poolside chaise with umbrella its $75. Although I didn't take a service, the spa looked nice and well run (I asked for a tour). The gym had high end workout equipment and was well stocked with clean towels and chilled bottled water. Speaking of bottled water, every room has freebies that are restocked every day.
I stayed in their lowest room, the studio suite. Even so, the furnishings were nice. The bed was wonderfully comfortable and the bed sheets so smooth. There is a full kitchenette equipped with pots, pans, plates, cups, cutlery, toaster, coffee maker, tea pot and even a small 2-ring cooktop, and Sub-Zero refrigerator.
The flat screen TV was big enough for the room, though the remote was frustrating to use, difficult to just watch TV without scrolling through marketing channels.
The bathroom was immaculate with polished marble everywhere.. which you would think was a good thing, but taking a shower on it, or trying to walk from the shower to the sink it could have been dangerous. There is a whirlpool tub enough for 2 large adults, but the water has a definite green tinge to it.. not quite sure why, but it didnt smell and I was assured it was perfectly safe to use. The lighting in the bathroom was okay, but there was no good setting if you wanted to have mood lighting, plus there were no nightlights in there either, which made navigating the glass door to the toilet a little unnerving. The coolest thing about the bathroom is the TV located behind the mirror, but for some reason the remote didnt work when i tried to watch the playoff games, so had to settle for the plush sofa instead.
I took the advice of other Yelpers, and asked for a room away from the train tracks, happy to say that I didn't hear any noise from that. 
One funky feature at this hotel is that they have shared vestibules into each pair of rooms. Apparently, the neighbors tonight is a family of 4 with young kids. So their room door is opening\/closing\/slamming, along with the shared front door. Fun, fun, fun!
THe hotel has a free shuttle to both the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace, as well as to the Wynn across the Strip-- a mere 500' away. The Fashion Show mall is across the street, with plenty of shopping and food options.

We had made reservations at the Las Vegas Trump Hotel for the weekend.  After a 7 hour trip from San Diego we finally get to the Trump around midnight, a little tired from our longer than usual car ride.  We are greeted very nicely and everything was nice and clean.  We go to the front desk to check in and that is when our nightmare begins. When we got to the counter, they let us know that our room wasn't quite ready. We weren't too thrilled to hear about the delay considering we booked our room two months prior and were tired from the drive, but said okay and they told us it would be only a half an hour wait.  We went to the lounge and had a couple drinks at the bar, where the bartenders were very friendly and accommodating. We returned to the counter after 45 minutes of waiting and politely asked the status of room. They said they were cleaning our room and it would be ready soon. They were sorry and they would upgrade our room for free. Still, we were kind of blown away because when we asked what was going on, they said they have a ""situation."" 

Now being in the hotel service industry I know that when a hotel goofs or a ""situation"" arises the hotel should do its best to try accommodate.  The only thing we got was a sorry and it would be another half an hour.  So it's now 1:45 am  and we are getting a little pissed, so we went up to the lobby manager and requested an explanation.  All she gave us is ""there is still a situation upstairs.""  Trying to please us, the manager gave us a $25.00 voucher for the bar.  The only problem is that the bar closes at 2:00 am and so when we went to use the voucher the bar had closed.  

So now it is 2:30 am and we had no where to stay and didn't want to walk anywhere else, since the Trump is off the strip and the only parking they have is valet.  
   
Finally at 3:30ish in the morning I had enough and let them know that this was unacceptable and enough is enough.  I wasn't furious about the room not being available, I was furious about them lying to me for three hours.  After I had called them out on it and they saw how upset I was getting, they finally got us a room at the Palazzo.  After it was all said and done it was 4:00 am on Friday before I was able to get into a room. 

Needless to say I had a crappy start to my Saturday where I was going to meet up with some friends for brunch and drinks at the pool.  But that was ruined because I finally woke up around 11:00, still tired and pissed from my experience at the Trump.  

I don't  know if it was new managers on the floor or inexperienced staff, but if you have a situation where a guest is not going to have a room for the night that they paid for, you should do your best to accommodate. Not make up stories and try to buy time.  This is a five star hotel and very little was done to accommodate us and make a enjoyable stay.  I know when our hotel had a ""situation"" we offered free meals, free night stays, or vouchers to other places to enjoy the town.  

The Trump front desk was a complete let down.  The management had no ethics or integrity nor did they have any interest to try to make it up to me.  This is why regretfully give this place a 1 star, which saddens me because I had heard nothing but great things about this place.",12,0,0

We did book through a travelzoo deal and expected to get 2nd hand treatment similar to other bookings I've had through hotwire; however, it was anything but the case.  

The hotel is located a little bit to the side of the strip right across from the Mall with Nordstorm and about a 8 minute walk from the new Wyn towers.  

There are no casinos in the hotel and was exactly what I wanted.  The smoke of stale cigarettes and beer is not what I want to smell right before bed.   

There is a shuttle that takes you to either Ceasar's palace or the Wyn every 10-15 minutes.

There is only valet parking - Good because you don't have to walk back through the heat of lots to your hotel, bad because its really annoying to call up a valet each time you forget something like say beer in the car.

The room we had was HUGE.  We had a king size bed, a love seat, a little couch, a kitchen area with a tea pot, coffee maker, one of those European two burner stoves, a mini fridge, and drawer with utensils, can opener, bottle opener, etc waiting for you to move in.  And the bathroom had a shower, two sinks, a toilet area, and a hot tub and a TV! Very cool to watch the news while brushing my teeth.  

The beds were comfy and I never heard any of the noise from the side-rooms which I was surprised to learned had like 20 kids in there, or the hallway.  So good internal soundproofing.  HOWEVER, the room we were in faced a train stop or something where in the middle of the night there were one or two (maybe three) loud train honks.  I heard one at night, but I once I'm asleep, it didn't bother me.  It did bother my bf whose a very light sleeper, so you might want to ask about that before checking in to get to the other side.

I mentioned the trains as a sidenote about my boyfriend when I checked out and said it didn't bother me at all since I slept through it all.  The guy said our hotel stay is pre-payed already but he waived all our charges such as the resort fee without a second comment.  I didn't think the train was that bad (BF did) but I can't say no to free stuff and no resort fee for a few days.  The resort fees I think are $25 per day.

There's a pool area with very comfy chairs.

My only real complaint is the gym! The gym was nice, had wet towels, dry towels, 10 treadmills or so, a few ellipticals, weights, water and everything a gym needs but it was like 75 or 80 degrees there! I know people who sit and walk in a gym like it warm, but those of us who try to run are dying! Might as well just run outside, that's hot hot it was in there!  Really a shame because it was one of the nicer hotel gyms I've been too, just wish they lowered the temperature there a bit more.

However, after camping for a week in a small tent on the ground, life couldn't get any better than our stay at Trump tower vegas.",3,2,2

Don't know if it's because it's a Trump hotel or because it doesn't have a casino or maybe it's too expensive.  But it wasn't crowded at all.  Service when we went was great.  Nothing to complain about there.  

The only bad thing, as stated, is it's valet only parking.  So you have to pay\/tip every time you pick up your car, or drop off your car.  It can also be a pain if you forget something in your car and you need to run to get something.  But when we were there, the valets were pretty quick in retrieving your car.

My friend and I were able to check in early, and the concierge recommended several shows and restaurants as it was our first time and we were trying to assess what we wanted to do.

The rooms were sparkly clean and beautiful, and the bathrooms are huge! There is almost a full kitchen with cook-top and all, so if you rented a car or drove, you could easily run to Whole Foods and cook some meals if you wanted to.

I would definitely recommend this hotel. I have stayed elsewhere in Vegas, and though I do have other favorites, this is an extremely high quality hotel for a low price tag. The only downside is that it is on the far side of the strip so it takes a long time to walk to City Center. Otherwise, it's great.",1,0,0

In the room itself, one faucet in the bathroom didn't work, one of the closet doors didn't work (permanently locked?) and the free wifi was nice But very spotty (bad connection)!

Went here for a weekend with three of my friends for a special occasion to catch up.  We wanted to stay at a 5 star resort since it's rare we all get to see each other, and were SO disappointed.  

Checked in, found out that all the rooms only have ONE king bed....and a ""queen"" pullout that is actually a twin.  (the twin pullout is cheap and you can feel the springs so have fun sleeping on it).  When we pulled out the twin bed there was stains and no bedding...just a mattress which is super classy right?  Our room wasn't clean when we checked in, I put a receipt down on the counter and went to pick it up and it was stuck to the counter in sticky residue (gross).  We had one coffee mug?  And then a dirty napkin on our window sill that had brown stuff all over it?  We had NO tv remote, we had to call down to ask for a tv remote which took an hour to get to our room. And we had to ASK the hotel for bedding for the pullout bare mattress.

The restaurant in the hotel is overpriced, with awful food and the service takes FOREVER.  We tried to eat at the lobby restaurant but waited 40 minutes for horribly mediocre food.  We waited 20 mins for water and were the only people there so that was awful.  

They charge you a $25 resort fee BEWARE!!! They explained it covered coffee and water (which are even free at a Holiday Inn).  And a shuttle that only takes you as far as Ceasers Palace.  

Also it's off the strip and not close to anything.  Our room had a view of the highway.

Customer service was excellent! Every employee we saw and talked to were extremely friendly and helpful. As for the hotel...the rooms were very nicely decorated and had wonderful Jacuzzi tubs (a word of warning, if you decide to use shampoo and make a bubble bath for you and your lady...1\/4-1\/2-half a bottle max) I used a bottle and a half and quickly had bubbles all over the bathroom floor!) We had a room on the ""far"" end of the hotel facing the strip and supposedly away from the train...woke us up at 7am, so we asked to be moved. They put us on the other side of the building without a strip view and fortunately, we didn't here the trains anymore. The view of the strip is nothing special so I would say stay on the opposite side...the train noise sucks! The pool sucks...small and nothing to it. The gym is small, but decent. As far as location...you're not on the strip, which is definitely an inconvenience! they do run a shuttle from to the Wynn and Ceasars, which comes very often and helped. The forum shops are right next door and with the amenities in the room, you can pick up snacks, breakfast food, liquor etc and save some cash. Overall, I'd say if you're trying to save and don't mind not being on the strip, then stay here. Although, the new Linq hotel also has no casino and I believe my lady said it was about the same price...if that's the case, I'd stay there as it's definitely convenient to be  on the strip!

1) Very nice and helpful staff. Great customer service. 
2) LOVED the late check out - And I don't mean 12pm.. Their late check out is 4pm! Totally loved it. 
3) This hotel is not a casino, but they did have a store downstairs to purchase pills, water, etc. 
4) Since the hotel is not located directly on the strip they have a free shuttle service to the strip. Although it's not right on the strip it is right across the street from the mall. 
5) They also have a shuttle service to the airport for a fee. 
 
Now for the room: 
We got a simple king size bedroom, but I was impressed by it. The room was equipped with a small kitchenette with stovetop and mini fridge. Stocked with cups, plates, and utensils, which came in handy. There was also a pull out bed. The restroom was pretty large, with dual sinks and a tv in the mirror. Although I didn't get to use the jet tub, it was large enough for 2 people. One thing I didn't like about the restroom was the shower. The shower head was in the huge jet tub. It was awkward because jet tubs are deep with a higher and thicker ledge. The shower head also didn't have enough pressure. 

The only reason I didn't give this hotel 5 stars is because of the location and the shower situation. I wish they would have made a separate shower, the restroom was certainly big enough for it.",4,0,0

Location:  north of the strip, which is fine by me, but might not be for some.  Across the street from the fashion mall, close to Wynn.  

Hotel:  NO CASINO.  I didn't even know that there were hotels in Vegas without casinos!  So if you're looking for a quieter, traditional hotel in Vegas, this one is for you.  Also since there is no casino, you can access your room quickly, without having to walk half a mile to get to the elevator like the other Vegas hotels.

Room:  We had a room on the 19th floor, and it had a funky sewage smell.  We complained about this, but the front desk ended up not doing anything about it (more on this later).  The room itself was spacious with a little kitchenette.

Noise:  We could hear the train, it was loud!  Also we were on the pool side, and it got a little noisy during the day.  

Service:  The most important aspect of a good hotel stay.  I didn't feel that the hotel service was that great.  When we let the front desk know about the funky smell in our room and the noise from the pool, they told us we could pay extra for an upgrade to a higher, better room, but did not offer us anything else.  

Other aspects of hotel-
Resort fee:  they charge $29\/night (which they tax you on) that includes valet, wifi, and complimentary bottles of water.  This didn't bother me so much, but I do feel that it is misleading to say parking is ""free"" or wifi is ""free"".

Shuttle service:  Every 15minutes they have a shuttle that will take you to the Wynn or Ceasar's (until midnight). Not sure how punctual this is, but we did use it once and it was useful.

Any other city and this hotel would be a standout, but in Vegas where nice hotels are plentiful and there are so many choices, not sure I would come back here again.  If you do, try to ask for a room on a higher floor away from the pool.",8,3,2

First thing I should point out is that it is valet only. The wife and I drove past the hotel twice looking for the self-parking signs only to find out it was valet only when we drove into the valet. Good thing we happened to have cash on us.

The front desk and the valet employees were very helpful and courteous. Check-in was quick, smooth, and painless. Walking into the room made you feel like it was going to be a good vacation. We actually set our bags down when we walked in so we could take a look at;
          - nice city\/mountain view from the window
          - the comfortable sofa that pulls out to a bed
          - coffee table with extra chairs and a desk

Went out onto the strip after getting ready. Getting to the strip takes about 10-15 minutes of walking. I guess a nice thing is that you get to walk through the air-conditioned mall. The crappy thing is that the mall closes at 9pm.

TIP: The shuttle from the Forum Shoppes to Trump is on the lower level. Take the escalator down that is in the middle of the Shoppes.

The Spa at the Trump was awesome, and highly suggest it. The staff was very polite and professional,

The gym was in great condition and had a good amount of weights, medicine balls, core balls, and even a BOSU.

The swimming pool is nothing too special. The one cool thing it had was a little lip at the edge of both sides of the pool where you could lay out, but also be halfway in the water. About a half foot deep and extends maybe 12 feet out.

We also had to book another room for friends for a single evening, so called the hotel directly.  The service was equally friendly and professional, although she did mix up the details of the length of our stay by one day. Upon arrival, the reception fixed this for us without any issues.   Very friendly staff.

At the top of our list of the main attractions was the exquisite food at the DJT restaurant.  Sometimes the most simple foods prepared with the rarest and finest of ingredients are what impresses the palate the most.  In this case, we ordered the caprice salad, which was ripe heirloom tomatoes and premium, fresh mozzarella, and -- the most sensational flavor -- mixed green leaves with a balsamic and type of olive oil that I have never before experienced in my life.  Our waiter himself was an executive chef and absolutely knew his foods.  When we asked what it was that made the dressing so delightful, he said ""there's a reason some olive oils and some balsamics cost over $100 a bottle"".  I'll never forget that particular appetizer.  

The service in the hotel is just superb. When we arrived I had a nasty headache and called the Bell desk to see if they could bring something up to our suite on the 48th floor.

However, we came to Vegas for a trade show, and didn't want to spend our company's money on anything too expensive.  My husband and I just had our wedding at the Trump National Golf Course in Palos Verdes last year, which was beautiful-so we expected the something similar to the golf course-great service, cleanliness, and great ambiance.  

BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!  The first night we got back to our room from the trade show, we ordered room service because we were too tired to go out and eat.  Eck!  The spaghetti and bolognese was the blandest pasta we have ever tried.  There literally was no taste of salt or the tomato sauce in the pasta.  Even when you add a bit of salt, it still tasted extremely bland.  Secondly, I had ordered cranberry juice.  Be aware-this isn't your normal cranberry cocktail that you get at bars or anywhere else.  This is actually a thick squeezed cranberry juice.  What I was expecting when I put that drink in my mouth was some sort of sweet juice, but got a sour thick concoction instead.  Gross!

Ok-so nighttime falls, and my husband and I are getting ready to go to bed.  We start placing some of the pillows on the lower end of our bed.  We then realize there are scuff marks on 2 of our pillows-almost like someone stepped on our pillows.  Disgusting.  Good thing, they gave you 4 pillows so that we at least got to get one pillow each.  So, we started to try to go to sleep.  While I was trying to get some sleep, I kept hearing the noise of the streets of Vegas and trains.  I woke my husband up at midnight because I wanted him to see if there was some sort of window that was opened.  Well, on the window sill, they have some sort of sliding thing where you could open it slightly for air.  HOWEVER, in our room, it was broken so that we couldn't close it.  So, because my husband was tired and didn't want to go through the trouble of changing rooms in the middle of the night, he got towels, and covered up the holes where there was air and noise coming in.

The next day, we head out to our trade show, and when it ended, we came back to the room to rest a bit.  Even though our housekeeper did come into the room, I noticed that she didn't really tidy up any of my toiletries in the restroom.  Usually when I stay at Wynn or Encore, my toiletries are all lined up in a neat order when we get back to the room.

Here's my email to a manager at Trump:


Hi Tracy, 
My name is-------, we stayed at your hotel last weekend ( 10\/03\/13 to 10\/06\/13) on room 4419. When we got back to our hotel room on Saturday night, my daughter's bear is not in the room. I called the housekeeping immediately to inform them that the bear was missing and I was told that someone will call me back, around midnight and nobody had called. My husband then decided to go to the front desk and spoke to Magid (I'm not sure if I spelled his name right). He told my husband that process of where the linen goes after the housekeeper clean the room and told him that he will check on it and will personally call us the next day.  True to his word, he did called us and let us know that he contacted the housekeeping and where the linens are being sent and they don't have the bear.
My daughter has been crying and refuse to leave your hotel without her bear she named ""Poppy"". This bear was originally my eldest who is 14, and she gave it to her sister when she she was born. It is not a souvenir toy, it is a raggedy bear with only one eye. But my daughters loves this bear, and this toy travels with us everywhere we go. My daughter asked me today if the people from the hotel cares to find her bear, and I promised her that you guys are looking for 
Poppy. My daughter is extremely sad without her bear.  I am writing you an e-mail not to get any of the staff in trouble, but to please help us find Poppy. 
This is not about money or any other type of compensation, we just want our stuffed toy back.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read my e-mail and I am hoping that you can help us,

The rooms are spacious. The TV on the mirror in the bathroom is a great added touch. The spa tub is big enough for two, as well as the shower.

The first thing that struck me was the peace and quiet.  There are good points about coming to a place that isn't attached to a casino.  First off, you know that the hotel is focused on making your stay pleasant, since their income isn't being bolstered by their casino.  Also, the caliber of the clientèle is very different.  Less drunk people, and no crowds to be pushed through, no second hand smoke, no stale alcohol smell, no yelling.  Just people who want a peaceful, relaxing experience.  

The front desk agents were pleasant and attentive.  We got a strip view room on the 52nd floor, which was jaw droppingly awesome.  The room was very sleek and elegant, with understated touches of luxury.  Beds were very comfortable.  Loved the in-room kitchen and all the cookware and dining utensils provided.  Jacuzzi tub was wonderful.  Also, when I discovered our radio was broken, a new one was promptly brought up by a very professional attendant from house-keeping.  

The only reason why it's not 5 stars from me: it's a little too far from the strip (must take taxi), and I wasn't really floored by the food we got at the DJT.  My feeling is that this place hasn't quite reached its apex, since it opened during an economic slump and there isn't enough of a customer base yet to make it truly rock.

We reported it to their security department and have been very patient. It's been almost a month and they have not given us an answer (mind you, we have been the ones who have had to call, call, call to get any sort of ""update"") as to whether they are going to do anything to fix our car. We finally went through our insurance instead.

**Had they not effed up our car, this hotel would have merited a 3.5 to 4 star review**

The hotel itself is quite nice. The rooms are spacious and well appointed. The bathroom had a whirlpool tub - very nice indeed. The housekeeping department does a nice job of keeping the rooms clean. They are, in fact, cleaner than a lot of other high-end resorts on the strip.

Our biggest complaint was the bed. It was not very comfortable at all. My side was a little lopsided and the hubs found it to be lumpy or something...he couldn't quite find the right way to describe it. All in all, they need new mattresses, stat. Good thing we were always too pooped to really care.

*the curtains in my room were not even connected to the rods that you are supposed to use to close them

*why have a kitchen with no utensils. It says you can call housekeeping for any items you need. I stay at a five star hotel so that I don't have to call for anything. It should be right the first time.

*the glass table was disgusting
*the carpet outside of the elevator was very bunched up and I could easily see people who have trouble walking tripping and falling.

I've stayed at this hotel a few times and always refer my friends and family. The service is ALWAYS an A++++ and pricing is usually comparable. 24-hour room service (food, although pricey is worth every penny), spa on site, gym and pool are all added bonuses. 

The rooms - talk about SPACIOUS, suites with fully stocked kitchens, 2 full bathrooms (yes, ladies you don't have to worry about a shower schedule!) the decor is modern with a touch of luxury and class. King sized beds that you melt in. Extra bonus for the ladies: The lighting is also really good  and mirrors are plentiful so when you're getting dolled up for the night you know your face and your hair is definitely going to be on point. Wifi and bottled water are also included with the resort fee. 

This classic hotel is also across from the Fashion Show Mall so if you need some last minute items or just want to splurge on a shopping spree its just outside your doorstep. 

A definite recommendation from me especially for those necessary ladies trips or romantic getaways. 

Ps. Nerlie Walters has to be the best host at the hotel- if you're lucky to get her tell her I referred you.",2,1,1

The gal at the desk said that the room was ready and we can get the room key at the front desk....uhm...nah, at $180 a night bring that key to me.

Pros
+ The rooms are awesome...spacious, comfortable beds, quality linens & toiletries, kitchenette.

+ Free WiFi.

+ Lobby Bar is a great place to unwind for a drink or three.

+ Customer service was great during out trip.  Kudos to the front desk, bartenders, and bellmen who assisted us.

+ Great views.  You can see the Strip from one side of the tower and the Vegas Valley from the other side.

Cons
- The biggest negative was the fact that after 7 am or so, the freakin' trains start to run through the city and blast their horns at all of the train crossings.....there's at least 3 or 4 crossings in Vegas and you can hear that train through the windows and walls of your room.  If you're a light sleeper or bothered by this kind of noise, you can forget about sleeping in.

- The valet parking is inadequate.  The waiting area outside to pick up your car was not meant for a full blown hotel.  It was meant for a condo tower....so it's not made to handle the constant in\/out volume of a large Vegas hotel.  It also doesn't handle the cabs, limos, and shuttles very well either.  So you end up waiting for your car inside the lobby and try to see through the lanes of other cars to pick yours up when it's ready.

The 2 negative items are big ones for me and that's why this place gets 3 Stars in my opinion....otherwise, it could've earned 4 Stars.

There's also no casino at this hotel....which can be a positive or a negative to some people.  I'm indifferent.

Priceline name your own price, William rolled out the Shatastic price of $134 ($159 with all taxes and fees included) for - you guessed it - The Trump International Hotel. I made this reservation on Friday before we went for a last minute Vegas trip on Saturday.

All rooms boast a king sized bed and a queen pullout, but I wanted to see if there were any upgrades available. Upon arrival, I was told I could upgrade to a 1br suite for 50 bucks more. Um, yes please.

Three minutes and 57 floors later, we were in our McMansion of a room, corner suite, so the king sized bedroom was floor to ceiling windows on two sides of the room. The alarm clock has an iPod player with a great sound system, so you can blast your pre-club party music to get you all in the mood.

The master bathroom is big enough to live in, you could put a dining room table in it. Oh, and hello excess, there's a TV IN the bathroom mirror. Even the bathroom has a huge window in it with a strip view. There is a full kitchen with all of the accoutrements of your kitchen back home, so if you wanted to make dinner here, you certainly could. Two full bathrooms (2 showers) in this one bedroom suite really make this place a better deal than the one bedroom suite at The Signature at the MGM Grand.

The only con here was the pullout bed - it was REVOLTING. I've seen better mattresses shown in the slum in Slumdog Millionaire. We didn't even end up using the mattress, they just laid the amazing sheets over the couch and called down for an extra comforter, which came up right away.

If you are looking for walking proximity to casino\/bars\/clubs\/food, you'll have to go somewhere else. But if you don't mind cabbing it, you should not stay at any other place. The deal and the delivery on the deal are just too great to pass up.

Good to know: they have a $15 resort fee here, so factor that in when you Priceline it. But, the resort fee means (among other things) you can drink the bottled water in your rooms. Come Sunday morning, that water is a little bottle from heaven and totally worth the fee.",3,3,1

Note the use of the word ""allegedly.""

First, know that Trump Hotel (actually, Trump International Hotel) was supposed to be a condo tower. Why anyone would want to live in a condo tower on the Strip is beyond me, but hey, to each his own. Unfortunately, not that many units were sold, so the tower was quick-changed into a hotel, as well.

Trump is located on Fashion Show Drive, set away from Las Vegas Boulevard, and near the Fashion Show Mall. It is a short walk to the Wynn hotel and casino, which is essentially across the street. Trump itself does not have a casino (!), as they would not give him a gambling license due to the number of times Trump Entertainment has gone bankrupt in the past (as of this writing, it looks like it will happen again, soon).

The overall Trump experience was very good: we were treated very respectfully by the staff, who were all very helpful and courteous. Room service -- even though it was burgers and fries -- was especially good, as the waiter came in and placed a tablecloth over our table and set our places for us. But it was the little things that gradually got to us and led us to conclude that we wouldn't stay there again.

My friend slept in the spacious bedroom; I slept on the sofa-bed (I figured this was a good arrangement since he would later be coming back to my house and sleeping on my sofa). Upon unfolding the sofa bed, I noticed there were sheets on it. Upon closer inspection, the sheets had not been changed from the previous guest. A pair of socks was stuffed at the foot of the bed. We called housekeeping, and a maid promptly came up and changed the sheets. A similar pair of socks was in the bedroom, draped over a chair.

The room was a suite which also had a kitchenette. Upon re-heating some pizza, we discovered a dirty pan still in the oven. 

Trump charges $17 per day per device for Internet access, whether wired or wireless. This is actually standard for fancy hotels (the more middling Red Roof Inns, Best Westerns, or Motel Sixes actually hardly ever charge for Internet access). Still, though, this is 2009 and the Internet is akin to a public utility. Imagine being charged for electricity and water while you stayed there.

The last morning we were there, the fire alarm accidentally went off. It must have gone off on a different floor (I didn't hear it), but the subsequent broadcast apologizing for the malfunction was at least three times louder than the warning sounds that preceded it.

All of these things conspired to create an experience that was so-so at best. We were impressed by the robes, free slippers, and two bathrooms, but it's the little things that made us say that we would never stay there again.",1,0,0

People complain it's a bit off the strip, but that's the point.  It's NOT a casino hotel.  It's 0.3 miles or a 5-min walk according to Google Maps.  Perhaps they should have an overhead walkway to the FAshion Mall.  They have shuttles every 15-min to Wynn and 30-min to Caesar's, plus you either have a rental car or cab everywhere in Vegas.  In 100+ temp. who walks?  I'd agree this is a 5-star hotel with the one odd exception that the towels are 4-star.  I mean 5-star towels are fluffy soft and you want to steal them, because they're better than your towels at home.  Everything else from the service and room size is decor is 5-star.  I think you must be complaining about this place, because you have no idea what 5-star means and you just want to sound cool.  I mean seriously.  If you had the same price and choice between TI, Paris, Planet Hollywood, NY NY, Tropicana or this place, which would you take?  If you choose this place, then it's a 5-star, bc all those other places are 4-stars.  You can't call this a 4-star if it beats every 4-star in town.  So the pool's not super-huge, that doesn't make it a 4-star.  Super-huge pools are for casino hotels not hotel hotels.  Perhaps the only problem here is that this place can't compete as well with Cosmo and Aria since they have casinos and they're right on the strip in the middle of the action so they reduce their rates and attract people who have to bitch and whine but couldn't afford Cosmo or Aria even at half their rates.

We used the classic $20 sandwich trick (a $20 folded between driver license and credit card) and were upgraded from a city-view studio to a strip-view high-floor large studio. We also requested a late checkout, and were granted our request without a charge.

The room was extremely spacious, and it was heavenly to relax in the bed for a couple of mornings. The kitchen was useful, and the cleaning of the dishes was done by the maids every day. There were plenty of complimentary water bottles and coffee provided to us every day. The bathroom was the best hotel bathroom I've ever seen (better than westin and hilton's), as evidenced by the many pictures all of the others have posted.

The walk to the strip wasn't bad at all. Come on, let's not be this lazy.

Also, be sure to expect:
- the $15+tax daily resort fee
- the $12 extra daily fee access to the sauna at the spa
- the mandatory valet parking (no self-park)
- noise from the train throughout the night (on the strip-view side, it's not loud enough to wake you up).

I wouldn't hesitate staying there again at all, especially for the price.

Don't forget about the sandwich trick!!!! $20 seems to go a long way at the Trump.",3,0,0

Check-in desk was amazing, personalized service, that is why it may take a bit longer. I was offered the 2 bed suite for just a $150 upgrade at check-in. Best 2 bed Suite I have ever seen and I have traveled the world.
Just a class apart. I was walked by the Check In specialist to my Elevators that led me to the Suites. 
This hotel was smack opposite the Fashion Show Mall. 
They also run a shuttle from the hotel to Caesar's Palace every 15 min till 2 am on weekends and till 12 am everyday. Just Valet your car and enjoy.  

Strip views were spectacular. Plus all the Airplanes taking off from McCarran Fly right by you, Beautiful.

One bedroom corner suite, private foyer entrance, living room is fairly spacious, with full kitchen, dining table, full guest bathroom with shower, comfy sofa, couch seating, in room safe, floor to ceiling windows. It just there is NO refreshments and snacks in the fridge, just 2 bottle waters??? Why? We drove in late and I was thirsty, I needed some drinks, room service was our only choice, at least the food and drinks were delicious. Service was good too cause they already charge service fee in the bill. $25 resort fee each day was not worth it, we tipped housekeeping nicely to get more bottle waters and lotions. 

Bedroom is good, comfy bed, floor to ceiling windows with beautiful views, the bathroom is huge, with oversized jet jacuzzi and nice shower. It's supposed to be a great experience with a bathroom like that, they have TV in there too. 

BUT.... Beware of the glass door in the restroom! The bottom of the glass is really sharp, hurt my food pretty bad! I cut two of my toes, and I was bleeding so bad! 

Had to call security to take a look at it, they were pretty nice though, asked if I wanted to go to the emergency room, brought me band aids, first male security called in a female one to help me take care of my wound, filed a report, gave us a number to call if it gets infected later. And they put me on a wheelchair to get me out of hotel to my car, we were about to check out when I hurt my foot, they told us not to worry about check out time, just rest long and comfortable enough to leave. 

What an accident! I was in so much pain, but everybody was very nice and helpful, got me calm enough to leave the hotel. 

I loved the service and staffs of this hotel, the suite is OK, not much of my style, and the restroom door is extremely dangerous! I am so surprised nobody has ever hurt their feet from it???

When my friends and I arrived, we got there a few hours before check-in (which is fine) and we decided to kill time by going to the pool and enjoying some food and drinks.  We checked our bags with the concierge service (HUGE plus!), and made our way to the pool.  When we got there, we noticed there was a free cabana that nobody was sitting at (not even a towel was on it), and we inquired about what we needed to do to rent it.  The young lady proceeded to let us know that it's a $50 minimum in order to rent them (not a big deal at all), but that there were people previously on it and she wasn't sure if they were coming back or not since the rental fee gets you the cabana for the whole day (which doesn't make sense to me because they're missing out on opportunities to make money).  She then told us we can sit our stuff down on it and wait a little while to see if the people came back, and in the mean time she was going to talk to her manager.  After about 35 minutes, a couple walks in (I was able to see this because we were sitting right on the edge of the pool by where they came in) and they were inquiring about the cabanas.  Make a longer story short- the girl came over and told us we had to move our stuff because the people came back, when in reality they weren't ever there because I heard the conversation!  We took our stuff and moved to where there were four reclining chairs and set-up there, only not to be seen by a server for nearly 40 min!  When we finally got to order, it took another 20-25 minutes for our drinks to come out!  The rest of the staff was great, and more than helpful- but that pool staff definitely can learn a thing or two from others within in the facility.  My friends and I aren't confrontational, and we're not ones to make a scene lucky for them, because if we were there would've been a big scene made Saturday.  Other than that, the rooms were really nice and spacious- and the beds were super comfy!

TIP:  book through the hotel directly and you will be guaranteed late check-out!

CONS:  pool service, valet only (and if you don't tip they get smart with the usual ""i appreciate it"" line) which was inconvenient at times when I didn't have cash or just needed to run inside for a few.

PROS:  quick service when you call the front desk for things, good food reasonably priced, free luggage storage, no casino which makes it a more relaxing stay and not smokey, just off the main strip so there's not as much commotion outside the hotel, spacious rooms, tv in the bathroom!",0,1,0

I understand that it is July, one of the busiest months for all of Vegas, but it was made very clear that they were understaffed. The check in process took at least 30 minutes, with only 5 people checking people in, again it felt like they were understaffed. We arrived well after check in, however only 2 of our 3 rooms were ready. We were completely understanding and we were told the room would be ready soon, upon inspection. About 3 hours later, after I called them twice, they finally had gotten the room ready. 
After all this in the first few hours of my stay I was trying to stay positive. However, the issues unfortunately did not stop there. 
Later we called and asked if they could bring playing cards to our room. Staying in a 5 star hotel, in LAS VEGAS of all places, I didn't think this would be an issue. However, we waited and waited and the cards never came. 
The next morning I woke up and had already used the coffee and creamer in the room and called the front desk to ask them to bring more to my room. 40 minutes later I was still without coffee and creamer.  Had I known it was never coming I would have walked downstairs and gotten it myself. What really started to irritate me was that it felt like no one working had a sense of urgency. The hotel was busy and they did not care about trying to make the guest's stay a 5 star one. 
I usually stay at the cheap places when I go to Vegas.  For this trip we decided to splurge and go for the Trump tower, however it felt just like being at any of the cheap hotels I've stayed at in Vegas before. 
My last complaint is about the shower in our room. We were placed in a handicapped room, which I agreed to at the front desk. I was told the only difference in the handicapped rooms is lower fixtures, however the shower was......a horrible mess on slippery tile. The shower curtain was about 2 feet too short and water leaked EVERYWHERE. The shower is made so a wheelchair could be wheeled right in, with no border to protect water from leaking out into the bathroom. 
This hotel is really nice and I enjoyed my room, but the service was definitely lacking. 
The place looks amazing, but for what I payed I was expecting more.

From the valet to the bellman to the front desk staff to housekeeping... Every single person seemed to sincerely care about ensuring that our stay was as effortless and pleasurable as possible. The only time I have experience service commensurate with that at the Trump Las Vegas was at the Four Seasons in Manhattan. That is really saying something. The suites are gorgeous and reminded me a lot of the suites at the MGM Signature, another non-gaming property and one of my favorite hotels in Las Vegas. Perfectly appointed mini-kitchens (even in the ""studio suite"") luxurious bathrooms (two full baths in the ""one bedroom suite"") and 42"" HD televisions which I really do consider a requirement these days. The pool was another highlight, surrounded by endless open chaise lounges and circular, semi-tented padded lounges big enough for two.

The hotel is located just off the strip close to the Wynn, and offers a complimentary shuttle to the Wynn as well as the Forum shops at Caesar's Palace.  Taxis are of course in plentiful supply.

The rooms are beautiful with comfortable beds, amazing spa bath tubs built for two (but don't forget to bring your own bubbles or salts), and great views of either the strip or the mountains in the background.

The service is excellent, but be sure to dress to impress to get the best experience.  We received two completely different responses when we asked for help with a car.  The first time, we were dressed in jeans and jerseys from the rugby match and told that it was a VIP service only.  The second time, we asked the same person, the same question, just 45 minutes later than the first but this time we were dressed in a nice dress for me and a suit for my husband and told it would be just a moment.  Alas, my lesson is that if you want great service you need to look like you deserve it - for better or worse.

My one nit, which I'm not sure it would be different at other hotels, is that there are rail tracks that go right by the hotel and a freight train that was very loud at 5 am both nights that we stayed there. 

Also, don't be surprised by the $19.95 resort fee per room per night.  It's stated most places that you purchase the room, but it still surprises people.  It covers access to the fitness center, free wifi, etc.  Parking is add'l (probably best to not have a car anyway).",1,0,1

1) They called before my arrival and send an E-mail to make sure everything was ok

3) Price was fair - I got a studio - there was oven and refg on the side wall


CONS
1) The hotel has a unique smell (air freshener) that wrote me butts. It was pretty bad and very strong
2) They have a jacuzzi but the problem is that at 1:30AM someone was using and I could hear the water go down the pimps which woke me up

Overall it's an okay hotel - nothing too special. I will probably not stay there again as I could not stand the overall hotel smell - The hotel does not have a casino.

Let me start with intentions - for this trip to Vegas I was with my husband and (for the first time) our 8 year old daughter.  This is the first PG ""family"" Vegas trip we have taken.  With that being said, out intentions were to stay at a place that allowed us to get sleep at night and to shield our daughter's eyes from some of the rif-raf of Vegas.  Trump International definitely fit the bill for that.  We didn't have miles of smoky casino to walk though to get to the front door and the pool wasn't filled with drunk spring breakers.  We never heard any noise at night or doors slamming at 3 in the morning.  Now, if I were on a vacation with my girlfriends or with other adult couples I probably would not choose to stay at this hotel.  However, if your intention is to find somewhere low key to stay in Vegas, this would be the place.
As far as expectations:  The hotel is nice, but dated and a little beat up.  it is certainly not 5 star, but not horrible either.  If you are expecting something along the lines of the Four Seasons or the Bellagio you will be very disappointed.  Our room was HUGE for a very small price ($188 for the 1 bedroom suite.)  The staff is very attentive and service is very good and friendly overall.  There is only one small restaurant in the hotel and the amenities aren't great - i.e. no Starbucks and the hotel gym equipment is terrible.

Right across the street from the fashion show mall so if shopping is your thing it's perfect.

Right now the world series of poker is in town and this is the cheapest 5 star resort. I saw many 3 star resorts selling for just as much if not more.

* 3 boxes of tissues! 2 in the large bathroom, 1 in the small... my sniffly nose was very happy
* Across the street from Nordstroms, which is connected to the Fashion Mall
* Full kitchen, with utensils
* complimentary shuttle service to Wynn, Caesar's Palace, and a few more destinations on the Strip
* The lobby smells like the Perfume section in a department store

Lowlights:
* Slightly north of and isolated from the center of the Strip
* Only valet parking, which can be time-consuming if you always wanna drive your own car

As much as I enjoy staying at this decadent all-suite hotel every time, I do have other more affordable all-suite hotel preferences in mind (e.g. Westgate Flamingo Bay, the Platinum, Palms Place). But since this place is such a hit with my friends, I will be making plenty more visits here.",1,0,0

We were then offered to upgrade to a better room or better view at a discounted rate. We said no thank you but appreciated the offer. After the desks third attempt and our third no they finally proceeded with processing us. No problem so we went to lunch and enjoyed some shopping. We were told we would be notified asap when are room would be ready and it would be by 3. We'll we decided to head back to the hotel around 315. At 335 the hotel called to inform us our room was ready. They did not apologize for inconvenience nor did they offer any compensation. Just would expect a little more form a top rated hotel. Will see how the rest of our stay goes. Will send updates.  On plus side it's free parking.,1,0,0

Also front desk staff was uber hospitable and even though we had quite a wait at check in, very sweet and apologetic! We ate at the in house restaurant for breakfast on Sunday- but get there early.

I didn't know what to expect at first, but after living there for a business trip for over a week, I appreciated the service provided. I arrived late at night and was in tough shape because my flights were crazy delayed due to weather and I was off schedule, disheveled and cranky. Check-in was fast but kind of formal so it had steps to it...they wanted to give me a type of the facilities, but I just wanted to get settled.  I got a great rate on the room and was surprised and what the room offered. Basically a full kitchen, and two comfortable King beds. My room was, to my recollection, on the 46th floor was spacious, smelled great and looked spotless and had an amazing bathroom with a TV in the mirror and a telephone next to the toilet when you need to make those HUGE deals.. High energy! :) After arriving in tough shape, I immediately ordered room service very late at night...a Reuben sandwich with sides. It was kind of expensive but damn it was really good, stuffed high, on fancy bread, and fruit side including rasberries, and came quickly. After eating and getting settled, I was able to get some rest in good form. The hotel was quiet. It's very close to the Sands Convention Center which made it convenient for me. The concierge delivered five large packages to me in good shape after being shipped directly to the hotel from my company. House cleaning staff was excellent. Nothing in the room was broken or out of order.  Later in the week I rented a car for a couple of days and had good experience with the valets at the hotel.  With a co-worker who later showed up the next day to share the room with me, we both went swimming in the amazing pool at Trump... Clean, large and impressive pool with pool-side assistants that got us towels when we got out. Great service at the bar and OK service at the restaurant downstairs. We were pleased with the food big time, although the bar tabs and food costs were really high. I wonder if this is how they make up for the great room cost?  The breakfast buffet was expensive but really solid and convenient. It features some high end fruits, egg fare and breakfast staples along with some other expensive foods on the buffet.  You can also order off of the menu. One problem, the gold tinted windows in the hotel (real gold deposition) tend to block the signals to our T-mobile and Verizon cell phones. We were able to rely on the Wi-Fi just fine, but not being able to use our cell plans in the hotel put a cramp in our business dealings. Lack of a casino in the hotel is a big plus as is the no smoking policy. Overall my co-worker and i were impressed and want to come back to it next year for the trade show if possible, and we recommended it to others.

It being a holiday weekend, most resort\/casinos on the strip were priced pretty high. However, I was able to find a great deal at Trump on Expedia for $109\/night. 

We got a great room on the 57th floor facing the strip. The rooms are nicely appointed. All rooms have two doors to get through so you are away from the hallway and it's extremely quiet. There is a kitchenette that is fully stocked with a stove, microwave, fridge, toaster, blender, utensils, pots, pans, plates, pasta strainer, martini shaker and more. You can cook all your meals right inside your room, but there really isn't a grocery store nearby, so it's pretty unlikely that you will. Each room has a comfy king bed and a sofa bed so you can sleep up to 4. The bathroom has a huge jacuzzi tub and separate shower, and a tv right in the mirror. There is plenty of closet space. And there's also free wi-fi.

The staff is very friendly and accommodating, and you'll receive top notch service as you would expect from a luxury hotel. And that's all it really is. It is NOT a resort\/casino. There are only two restaurants, one bar, a pool, spa and gift shop. Which means you'll be spending most of your time being entertained at other places. While it's located across the street from Encore\/Wynn and next to the mall, it is set back from the strip, and you will end up taking taxis everywhere you go. So, on one hand, it's nice that you don't have to walk 20 minutes through a casino to get to your room, but if you're there to gamble, this is not the hotel for you.

4 stars for the value and the great customer service. Plus, they allowed early check-in and late check-out. But if you want to go all out, I'd suggest Palazzo or Encore.",29,13,25

From the bright gold windows that cast a glow over the neighboring mall to the upper management with thick New York accents. At the moment the doormen (another East Coast thing) open the doors for you, you are hit with a distinct, but pleasant aroma that soon becomes familiar. Although some Vegas hotels have enormous check-in lines, we were assisted immediately by extremely friendly staff members. 

I booked the room at a very friendly 119 dollar\/night rate on Expedia and was hoping I could get a free upgrade to a Strip view room, but was politely informed that that kind of upgrade on a busy weekend would run 25 extra bucks per night. I'm sure if I slipped her 20 bucks I might have gotten some results, but I tend to feel entitled to things like that. Despite the mandatory resort fee of 19.95 per night, I went for it anyways and was glad I did. Our view from the 48th floor was intoxicating. 

The standard studio is large and well furnished. The rooms include a kitchenette, with a fridge, microwave, stovetop, and sink. A small amount of dishes and utensils are also supplied. There is space enough for a small living room  and full size desk beside the king bed and flat screen. The bathroom is also large, highlighted by a gigantic jacuzzi tub and a tv in the mirror. 

I've heard some people complain about the mandatory resort fee. The 20 bucks goes toward free bottled water in the room, internet access, pool and gym, and free shuttles to either the Wynn or The Forum Shops at Caesar's. I'm sure it includes more, but worth it for 20 bucks.

nickel and dime you.  They charge 25 a day for a hotel charge but when my husband went up to the spa they wanted 12 extra TO USE THE STEAM OR SAUNA!!!  Unbelievable.  No slippers in the rooms and their robes where so old and scratchy.
No cue tips no cotton as well in the rooms.  They were very accommodating by
putting a foam pad on the bed so it was not as hard.

When we were there 4 years ago, they had a wonderful chef there. We were there
for 4 nights and had dinner there 2 of them.  This time we were also staying for
4 nights and were so looking forward to have dinner there.  First came the Martini, way to much vermouth in it.  Our first appetizer where crab cake and pork belly.
We waited for almost  l\/2 hour  and when they finally arrived they were COLD.
We both took one bite and realized it, as well as very poorly presented with
2 tiny pork belly pieces we absolutely could not eat it.  We were very disappointed
at the menu as well.  Mr Trump really needs to get a new chef there asap.
We are foodies, and our son is a Executive Chef in Dallas, I as well is a very
good cook, so we do know good food.

presentation.

Two complimentary bottles of water were included in the room, and there was also free wi-fi (though I suppose this is covered in the resort fee).The rooms have privacy doors in addition to your room door.  The room was immaculate.  I had a king size bed, living area, kitchenette, strip view and a HUGE bathroom with a shower and jacuzzi hot tub.  This was my favorite part!  

I ordered room service and that was awesome.  They give a lot of food, too.  I could not really hear anything below going on outside. It was quiet and relaxing.  The bed was also extremely comfortable.  

The staff were friendly and helpful from the valet to the bellman, front desk and room service.  Would absolutely love to stay here again and definitely recommend.  They do have an additional $19 resort fee, so just keep that in mind.

I will admit, my bottom lip quivered and tears surfaced when I found out we were staying at a place that was sans casino and off the strip.  Some of the other reviews noted it was walking distance to the strip, but 1) It's not walking distance when it's Vegas Cold or Vegas Hot 2) It's not walking distance for a girl that likes to wear big heels 3) It's not walking distance for someone that doesn't have a Karate Black Belt or their bodyguard with them.  They do have a free shuttle to the Wynn or Caesar's Forum which we used once on our way out, but the final pick up times are far before we are done for the night.  Cab rides to Rio or Paris area were under $10 before tip.

On to the good points:
I agree with all the good comments listed on the reviews here.  Great service, beautiful and smells good in the lobby. We never waited long for the elevators because they split them up so you will go to one elevator entrance if you're on the top third, another if you're on the middle third, etc..  Very nice front desk and valet peeps.  She offered a discount on an upgraded suite and my friend said he only takes free upgrades.  I'm not sure if he charmed her or they were short on rooms, but we got the free upgrade to the one bedroom suite and it was SWEET!  Full kitchen, huge living room, huge room, ginormous bathroom.  If my hubby was with me it would've been better, but I let my friend take the bedroom since he put the reservation on his CC hoping we could swap the next night, but he's not as nice as me, so warning to you shmucks like me, the sofa bed is not heavenly and if you share with someone, they should pay more if they take the bed. Luckily, I drink heavily in Vegas, so I got over it as soon as my head hit the nice pillow. We called housekeeping at 5am to ask where the sheets were, and they came down and actually made the bed for me. Bring your drinks and snacks if you stay here because they they do not have vending machines to stagger to in the early morning hours if you are waking up craving some carbonation.  They do have a small shop with a moshposh of stuff from $300 shoes to $5 can of Pringles, but again, it closes long before I'm heading back to the room. 

The stuff that was ""eh"":
1- No casino.  Did I mention that already?
2- Resort fee $22 per night.  This was lame because it wasn't pool season (in fact they closed it early due to wind and storms) and I didn't need the business center or use the workout room.  So if you calculate your bang for your buck, factor this in.
3-The ""city view"" was the other side of Vegas, as in the scary side, including a nice shot of The Erotic Heritage Museum, an abandoned hotel development, an old cheezy not-so-gentlemen's club and a not far but not walking distance to the side entrance to Circus Circus.
4- The 2nd night our key got deactivated and we had to go back down and to get it reactivated.

I would only stay here again for comfort and pampering or if I was on a business trip.  It would be a good place if I brought my teenage kids and my dogs. Yes, they're dog friendly! The place and the rooms are very nice.  Yes, you can hear the train every once in a while, which is bizarre, but I found it amusing.

First the positives.  The rooms are huge--the Trump was originally built to be condos, not a hotel--and have nice amenities like a hot tub with jets and a stove and microwave.  The staff was also friendly and helpful.

But there are too many negatives to recommend this hotel.  
-- The parking situation is wretched.  The Trump only does valet (no self-parking) and they are horribly understaffed.  We waited over 20 minutes just to drop off our car, and nearly missed our show.
-- The $25 resort fee borders on outrageous.  I know it's a new ""trend"" for hotels to tack on a mandatory fee for Internet and gym use, but I've never seen more than $10\/day at even the nicest hotels.  $25\/day is pretty insane.
-- The pool is really weak.  One small rectangular pool surrounded by chairs is all you get.  We ended up schlepping to another hotel to use their pool.
-- Certain things in the room were broken.  The main TV in the room was tilted off center, and the TV in the bathroom wouldn't turn off.  We ended up just muting it.
-- There's a freight train that runs a block away from the hotel and it's LOUD.  Trains only come by maybe 3-4 times a day, but just one train at 3 AM is all you need to ruin your night.
-- The bed was one of the more uncomfortable ones I've ever slept on at a hotel.  Way too soft, with weak, flaccid pillows.  I spent much of my weekend groggy and came home with a sore back--and not for the usual Vegas reasons.

I stayed at the Trump the first time I ever came to Vegas. With it's golden facade and golden bathrooms, it was hard not to be in awe of everything. The bathrooms were spectacular, and I, ironically, watched Obama on the TV located in the mirrors of the bathroom. Every person who helped us during our stay was kind and helpful, and we got upgraded (for no real reason) to a suite. Yes, it's off the strip, but at least it's conveniently located right next to Fashion Show Mall. There's also a shuttle available to take you to Caesar's so you can be in the middle of the action (tip your shuttle drivers!). There's also a shuttle that drops you off somewhat near the Wynn, but I didn't think that was very helpful. The pool here was immaculate and when we stayed, had no kids, so that's always a good time. There was music and a DJ, but not the untz untz scene I wanted to avoid. There's no casino or smoking here, which I loved. We booked our stay through priceline and got a great deal for less than $100. We subsequently used priceline to stay at Vdara, which is also casino-less, but I preferred our time and stay at the Trump. The only con I would say is the breakfast options were not that great... and you're supporting Trump.",9,6,6

We were on the 36th floor with a fantastic view.  The lobby is beautiful and there is a shuttle to the Wynn and Caesar's Palace every 15 minutes, which is helpful because the hotel itself is tucked away behind Fashion Square Mall.  It was a $15 cab ride to the Bellagio, which was a shame because that's where we spent the majority of our time.  Another negative is that there is a train thing that goes through the hotel somewhere .... not very descriptive but I could hear a train whistle all night - LOUDLY.  If you're going with kids, this is a good option because there is no casino at the hotel ..... good in some ways, bad in the other.  It would be great if we had closer options to a casino but if you're with a group and some want to go home and some want to continue gambling, you're out alone or you're stuck going back with your group.  There is also a $20\/day resort fee, which is extremely unncessary considering there is no casino and, except for the pool, nothing free that would warrant that required fee.  The 3-star from me comes from being far from the good parts of the strip, no casino, the loud train whistle and the required resort fee.

It had been about 5 years since my last trip to Vegas.  We went in early December (weekend of the Pacquaio fight) and I got a non-strip view basic room for $118 - plus the $25 resort fee, we were in for less than $150 per night on a weekend.  Room was great - bathroom was cool with the giant shower and enormous jacuzzi tub.  I think I took two jacuzzi baths over a couple of days.  

I like how there is no casino, so you get out of your car (free valet) ,or taxi and you can be at the elevators in less than a minute.  The entire property is smoke free too, which was a plus - don't worry, smokers can just go smoke out front.  Elevators are the fastest I've ever been in - amazing.  Service among the employees was outstanding.  Here's a tip - call valet before you go down,and your car will be ready when you get there. 

My brother in law upgraded to a corner suite and it was awesome... giant window with a view of the strip above the bathtub, and also came with a full size refrigerator.  We all decided to just grab a few 30-packs after the wedding and chill there rather than piss away more money gambling.

We booked a last minute room at the Trump towers to arrive at the CES show a day early (we previously had reservations for Thursday & Friday at The Mirage but there were no rooms available for Wed. night).  We paid $404 for a 1,000 sq. foot room for the 1 night.  I was impressed with the non-smoking policy, as we were bringing our son.  I always stay at the Hard Rock Hotel but changed gears when the Trump room had 1,000 sq. ft. compared to the 400 sq. ft HRH was offering, boy was I mistaken to cheat on my HRH (sad face).

Our room stunk like cigarettes and we were too exhausted to complain and relocate to another room.  We arrived at 8:30 pm, dropped off our bags noticed the smell but left to have dinner and returned at 11:30 pm for sleepy time.

Some items to consider - or areas that through me off.
Parking - is only Valet Parking, this is a hastlle when you need to use your car to drive to and from places with children.
Dining -  one fine dining restaurant and 1 adult lounge (not child friendly)
Location- hotel is located near strip clubs but there is a Nordstrom entrance right across the street.
Hallways- the carpet is buckling, as we walked to our room, floor 48 was hurting to the eyes. 
Rooms- they are reconfigured condos, run down. I could not believe all the scruff marks on the walls in the white closets.  The bathroom was very plain although it is completely made of granite, the glass shower doors make a huge bang when they close -  it sounds like they are going to shatter in a million pieces. The ironing board was a cheap white metal model and the iron was a low brand you would find at walmart. They offer complimentary coffee, I thought they would have a keurig but it was a mini machine with self brewing (just very out dated).
Sound - the windows are not sound proof and you can hear a train sound its' horns at the intersection near the hotel (I am assuming there is one) in the wee morning hours every couple hours or so.
Housekeeping- our sheets had lipstick on them (not mine)
Sofa bed- was a thin sad springy mattress, the one blanket that was meant for this living room sofa bed was rough from being burned.  I'm assuming it was fire retardant as it did not have any holes but one corner was hard and crispy. My son actually complained, he never complains.

Nice amenities
Kitchens in every room
2 complimentary water bottles
Free newspaper in the morning
Free shuttles to Wynn and Cesares Palace - the driver will come every 15 minutes for pick ups to and from the Trump tower until 12 am.
Hotel check in area is very impressive.

I will not be returning to the Trump towers but am glad that I did get the chance to experience it.  I'm actually dumbfounded as Donald hasn't fired the management staff at this place.

That's exactly what the our doorman\/valet guy told us every time we arrived back to the Trump from going out. This place is legit I tell you when it comes to their service. You are always greeted with a happy door man\/ valet guy when you arrive and they are always trying to find you a deal if you ask. Our guy last night found us a cheap deal for a Hummer limo to get to XS (club at Encore) for only $50. My girls and I fell in love with him. 

My other girl friend got an extremely bad burn from a motorcycle yesterday and we called the front desk to get us some ointment. They sent us a worker who not only gave her ointment and badges at 2:30am , but the guy looked over the burn, gave her basically a diagnosis and prognosis and all at 2:30AM! 

When we went to the swimming pool, we asked for towels. They sat us down at a row of chairs, which included couch beds, and laid out all of  our towels on our chairs for us. BTW.. try tanning at the pool at the shallow end where the water is only about 2-5 inches deep. It definitely beats and is cooler than sweating your butt off at your lounge chair in 100 degree weather. 

Besides the service, our room was awesome. You had to enter a door into a small walk area before getting to the bedroom itself. This made sure outside noise in the hall wouldn't bother us while we got our deep sleep. And our deep sleep was a contribution from the thick curtains that made  our room so dark, that we thought it was 3am when it was actually noon. Our cute kitchen, had a skillet, coffee cooker, utensils, fridge and toaster that were helpful when we warmed up our left overs from eating out. And the bed.. boy was it comfy. Soft bed back board, down pillows and blankets to sink into. I felt I was in heaven. 

And the hotel itself was just clean and gorgeous. This hotel, I mind you, does not have a casino and does not permit smoking. To compensate for that, you get AWESOME and I mean AWESOME customer service. I felt like the Trump was my home to go to after going out on the strip. (Yes, this is basically half a mile or less from the strip, and exactly a 5 minute drive to the Wynn. That was awesome, considering we only partied at the Wynn or Encore any way). And we got a sweet deal on Orbitz for only $250 for two nights!

Easy to use online reservation process and rates were reasonable. The rooms were spacious and clean and the staff was very friendly as well.

Here are some good and bad things about our stay. Please keep in mind my wife has been working for the Four Seasons for over 18 years, and I'm basing our experience and expectations from this perspective.

The good: Very big rooms and bathrooms. We had a corner one bedroom. Eddie from housekeeping helped us set up the pullout sofabed and brought us an extra duvet and pillow top bed cover and put it all together for us. What a great help! The kids loved the TV and the jacuzzi tub in the main bathroom.We were on the train side, on the 33rd floor and it wasn't bad at all. The mini kitchen was also very convenient. The pool, while small, was very well kept and nice. We rented a cabana for the day (well worth the money) over the busy weekend. The cabana rental includes a reserved circular bed and a lounge chair - keep in mind by 1pm all the chairs in the pool area were already taken. Kevin, our attendant, was absolutely fantastic. He was there whenever we needed something and kept our mini fridge well stocked. The AC and TV were very nice as the day heated up and you needed a break from the sun. This was definately one of the nicest appointed cabanas we've used.

The bad: Parking. I can live with the fact that it's valet only. However, the lines were out the driveway and we experienced a wait time of at least 10-15 minutes to get into the hotel, and a 15-20 minute wait to pick up our car from the valet.Taxi cabs couldn't even get into the property. If this hotel has aspirations of reaching a AAA Five Diamond status, this just will not work. Tommy, one of the valet supervisors was trying his best and putting forth great effort, but he was obviously too short handed to handle the volume. I would hope the hotel management takes time to review this, and I would make this recommendation. The Four Seasons has a process in place to handle these situations - it's called a crunch. It doesn't matter if you're a member of the planning committee, director, manager, or hourly employee,but  when a crunch is called it's ""all hands on deck"" to that department that is being overwhelmed. My wife who works in Sales and Marketing, has had to park cars, turn rooms, do room inspections, assist in the banquet kitchen, just to make sure the customer experience is never compromised at the property. I hope the Trump hotel will keep in mind that valet parking is their customer's first and last personal experience of the hotel.",0,0,0

It had a full shower, a whirlpool tub, toilet and a double sinks in one bathroom.  This particular room had a second bathroom in it which was also nice.

 The hotel is located just off the main street of the strip. Is right across in the Fashion Mall. My only issue regarding the hotel is that there is a train track right behind it. It can be a little noisy early morning.

There are plenty of places around to eat at if you're on a budget. The restaurant inside the hotel is not for someone on a budget. $21 for the breakfast buffet per person. I've seen better buffets in the casinos.

When I stayed here last summer, it was literally the worst experience I've ever had at a Las Vegas hotel. First impression was the place looked gaudy with a distinct 1990's feel. Second, the room was not even clean, there were issues with mold in the shower, cup rings on the table by the bed, and a urine smell on the sheets. The room was extremely loud...I could hear people talking in the hallway throughout the night. When I called the front desk to ask for additional towels, they were rude and short with me, and the towels never even showed up!!

I would suggest staying anywhere in Vegas other than here. It's not on the strip and too far to even walk to the other hotels\/casinos. There are no bars or restaurants within walking distance if you want to eat outside of the hotel (and trust me...you do). The only restaurants in this cheap hotel are overpriced and the food is terrible (think mall food court). Most of the luxury hotels on the strip like the Wynn, Encore, Palazzo and Venetian are all less expensive, much nicer and more comfortable.

I liked the very spacious lobby.  Everyone there was very helpful.  We stayed here on a Saturday night because we had a good deal on hotwire.com.  Then we stayed at the MGM on Sunday and Monday because we wanted to be closer to the ""action.""  I wished we stayed at the Trump all three days, because moving over to the MGM was definitely a downgrade.

There were only a couple of things that I didn't like about the hotel.  The pool was pretty small.  It was not very impressive at all.  And the water pressure in this place is pretty bad, but I'll get to that later.

I liked our room a lot.  It was very spacious and clean.  We got updated to a strip view room, but we were so far away that the view didn't really amount to much.  Still, an upgrade is an upgrade, and it was nice of them to offer it to us.  The bathroom was a good size, with a huge area for the toilet and the shower.  The problem with the shower, and I noticed it a to a lower extent at the MGM, is the water pressure.  It was way to weak.  The shower area was large, but I felt like we had to run around to get wet.  It was pretty sad.

The size of the room was great!  We had a little kitchenette, which included a microwave, refrigerator and stove top.  We also had a nice area with a sofa and desk.  There was definitely enough space to make us feel comfortable.  The MGM on the other hand was similar in price, but the room was smaller and we had no view at all.  And this was the newer remodeled King Room.

I would definitely go back to the Trump.  I loved how everyone was very helpful.  I loved that there was a shuttle to Caesars and The Wynn every 20 minutes.  I loved that there wasn't any smoke smell, probably because there is no casino on property.  And I loved that when we asked for a late check-out, they let us leave at 4pm!

The hotel room is just about right for what you pay for it, BUT you do need to tolerate loud trains rumbling by at all hours of the day during the stay and lousy customer services.

All that changed when we arrived at the hotel. It not not your typical Vegas hotel. It is not on the strip. There is no grand driveway up to the front door, nor is there self-parking. Once you walk into the hotel, you do not have to wind your way through part of the casino floor to reach the check-in desk, nor do you have to wait in a long line to check-in. Once you are checked in, the walk to the elevators and ultimately your room is quick.

Our room was AMAZING for the price. We were on an upper floor with an outstanding view of the strip. As a result of the Strip having a slight curve to it and the hotel being off-Strip we had a fabulous view of TI, The Mirage, Paris, Bellagio, etc. We spent hours on the sofa enjoying the view -- both during the day and at night with all the lights.

The room was tastefully decorated and luxorious. Likewise, the bathroom was wonderful with an oversized jacuzzi tub and a remote controlled television in the mirror. 

Service was impeccable.

As someone else stated, there was a resort fee. I have encountered that with other hotels when using Priceline. 

I was surprised that there was no gambling in the hotel. 

The hotel's restaurant and shopping options are limited compared to other places. They do have an extensive in-room dining options.

You will not like this hotel if you are looking for one-stop gambling, eating, shows, and sleeping.

We also found that since it is off-Strip, it was easy for cabs to take back roads to get to other hotels. We liked not being stuck sitting in traffic on the Strip.",1,0,1

The lobby smells like fresh flowers which is amazing coming from a smoke filled casino. There is no slots in this hotel, which I love. The pool is nice (a bit cloudy water) & their strawberry Island Oasis smoothies hit the spot. All employees are so friendly and accommodating. Bringing more water bottles, more shampoo, whatever it may be to the room to make sure that your stay is perfect.

They also have a shuttle that goes to Wynn\/Encore and also Caesar's Palace. It is a great place to be if you do not want to be in the commotion of Las Vegas. It is nice to walk the strip at night, but then come back to someplace that smells fresh and is beautiful.",11,6,8

I admit the the bathroom was very big, and had a TV in the mirror which was a nice touch.

Also, noticed that the ligth switches are really chea, so cheap that one of them was broken from previous customers.....so as a result, got the front desk to send maintenace crew to fix these issues.

Because the hotel is close to the railroad tracks, expect to hear the train come on through.....late a t night too.

My mother also eplained to me that the hotel smelled of mold, and smelled musty .  We booked a room for her to go the MGM which was way better.

Check in was superb, Christopher at the front desk is so nice and accommodating.  The lobby is spotlessly clean, no smoke at all.  Elevators spotlessly clean.  Room on 33rd floor is nice sized, spotlessly cleaned and well appointed.  Separate shower and jacuzzi tub, dual sinks.  Nice fridge and microwave.  We love the room.   Went to take a shower...NO water.  Called down for service.  Waited 15 minutes and called again.  Got a snotty operator (first one was very nice) who said it would be 10 min. I let her know it has been over 15.  Her snotty self said well then it will be 20 minutes.  Nice.  Bad attitude.  Anyhow, maintenance does come and he is very pleasant.   Sees what's wrong and pulls off the shower head as it is clogged or something.  He replaces the head and it is better.  He says there is clearly an issue and will check it but for now at least we have some water.  

NOW my issue is clearly someone cleaned the room before we got here. Clearly the water wasn't working then yet it wasn't addressed.  Now that is annoying.  This should have been handled before we checked in.  Oh well. Room is spotlessly clean and the shower is flowing nicely. All is good. 

Bed is super comfy, nice soft robes in the closet and lots of towels.  Other than the water in the shower so far so good.  Good ac too as it is 106 here.

Update as it needs to be updated. The next day (today Saturday ) TV stops getting a signal. No clear picture or sound. We call and maintenance is here very quickly. Says it is a common issue...power supply wears out. Changes it for us in under a minute.  Very. Nice except he hangs around for several minutes hunting for a tip.  I will not tip for maintenance issues like this. I tipped the front desk $10 on check in, valet $5 every single time I get my car (and there is no self parking here so it is ALL valet) but I am not tipping for a busted tv.  He finally leaves.  TV works. Then this evening we go to dinner at the forum shops and take the free shuttle.  Very convenient and driver 1 super nice ( and he was also tipped). We go to pick it up...huge fiasco at the line and the shuttle driver 2 was unprofessional and unhelpful and to be blunt..rude.  Suffice it to say my group and 4 other groups all had to take cabs. We were livid. We called and asked for the manager. We got heather on the line. Heather was very professional and helpful and resolved the issue as best she could. When you have 5 unrelated and completely separate people all upset about the same thing...you know there is an issue.   

So in a nutshell after this novel of a review...3 issues, 3 easy resolutions.  I would stay here again actually as the rooms are wonderful and this place smells delightful. Like flowers all the time.  No smoke, no litter, no dust.  Very clean.  I understand our issues can happen anywhere and the Trump staff was, for the most part, very good at handling them all.  Plus the location which is 100 feet from nordstroms, is AWESOME.  If every hotel had a manager like Heather ( and I hope the Trump execs read these reviews) and front desk like Christopher, then clients would be very happy and would return.

The different teams of banquet, catering, marketing, sales and finance do not talk to each other at all, and for an event this is a NO Go. we learnt it the hard way - so beware!

Was planning a reunion event by working with several hotels. Trump was the worst in terms of responses and locking up, but the prices were competitive, so we went ahead. . Then came the bigger nightmare of absolute unprofessionalism.

Post event - they first didnt provide have an invoice, but charged for an amount 2 days after the event. Which we found was in the ballpark of previous agreement so it was okay.

A month later a bigger invoice was charged to another credit card . Most (80%) of the expenses were double charged and they charged us for things from a different event (that had nothing do with us). Best part - finance had no clue we were charged before and they wont respond to us for weeks - but havent taken the charge back! Not a recognition of the mistake, no apology and more importantly no refund or resolutionI Asked to escalate, tried to reach out on twitter to get a resolution - NOTHING! Charges on my card remain and now am taking the credit card to dispute the transaction. All this pain for a event in vegas?? Sheesh!
So here you go - this is a well deserved HORRIBLE rating for event-hosting. Give trump a skip.

The issue is still not resolved. I would gladly like to have a conversation with the GM to talk about not just this issue, but some serious operational issues with this establishment. Tried reaching them on LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter - nothing whatsoever.",3,0,0

Last week my wife lost her phone (an hour before our return flight) somewhere under or near the MGM shopping area. A Good Samaritan gave it to security at the trump hotel. Security turned on the phone contacted me and without being pushy suggested calling back the ""lost and found"" department for reassurance. This was Friday night,  Monday morning I contacted lost and found and spoke with a young lady who took down my information, confirmed the item was mine and expedited for me all without the slightest hesitation. Within an hour of our conversation, I had a FEDEX tracking number in my email. 

We had assumed the worst, ""what are the chances anyone is going to want to do all this work for a phone"". To some it might be nothing, but many of our pictures from our hiking trip were on that phone.

I reiterated that the third party, Priceline, actually DOES agree to issue a refund IF the hotel agrees. However, the sociopathic, greedy Trump culture was pervasive at his hotel, and they  kept repeating this line which was blatantly false (I confirmed with 2 agents at Priceline; they just needed the hotel to agree to a refund, and then Priceline would issue my refund).

Pros:
-no smoking in lobby and rooms - great for people who are allergic to the smoke
-rooms and bathrooms are of a nice size, especially if you're sharing the room with multiple people
-while the pool itself is small, it's enough for the number of guests who are lounging around. You can always find a chair and spot in the pool without too much trouble. It's also a low key atmosphere for those who just want to relax and read a book. Waiters seem to come around frequently to serve people at the pool.
-There's a mini kitchenette - but you have to ask for utensils and cooking materials

Cons:
-slightly off the strip which requires either a taxi or short walk to the wynn. 
-while the hotel is nice, it's comparable to your average business hotel you would find in any other city. If you're looking for a ""Vegas themed"" type of hotel, this resort is not for you. 
-no casino, so you'll have to walk to the strip for night life

There was floor to ceiling storage which was great. And the bathroom was really nice. It had a large walk-in shower and a huge soaker tub with jets. They had a pool area off one of their casual dining restaurants in which you could lounge and order food. We had a large circular lounge chair with an umbrella (free to use during the week but cost money to reserve in the weekend). One of the reasons I would come back is that there was no casino downstairs which meant no smoke. The smell is almost as bad as the health effects. I liked that I didn't expose my children to that. Plus the ease of their valet service was great. We just called the front desk and let them know we needed our car and it was downstairs waiting for us.

Keeping this in mind will definitely make your stay a whole lot more pleasant. I mean... maybe people like to complain just for the sake of complaining, I don't know. I know I do sometimes, but really? A little trip planning and some research will tell you that there is no casino and the parking situation is valet only. Personally, at the end of the day, I really enjoyed the fact that we didn't have a casino. After walking through and playing in casinos all day, being able to head right up to the elevators and our room was nice. The complimentary valet was also a nice touch, made our entire stay feel very #fancy.

I've gotta say that I loved how every single aspect of this hotel felt very upscale. Um, hellooo.. everything here practically glitters. From the gold facade of the glass windows from the outside of the hotel, to all the gleaming marble errrrthang, and even the sparkly decorations in the lobby--I loved every bit of it. The lobby smells so lovely, all those flowers! So refreshing after smelling cigarettes in casinos all day. 

I lucked out on priceline and was able to get two of the most basic rooms here for a pretty sweet price. Even for the most standard option available, the rooms here are super spacious, comes with both a huge bed and a pull out couch, equipped with a little living room\/seating area, and even a kitchenette! Not that you'd need to do much cooking in the land of cheap buffets, but having the option is definitely nice. I loved that there was even a coffee maker and a nice and cold fridge! There's a whole lot of storage space, and awesome floor to ceiling windows. Loved spending a few moments at the window before knocking out, since we were lucky enough to get a room on a pretty high floor with a gorgeous view of the strip! 

They really don't skimp on space here, because I think that the Trump's bathroom is one of the largest I've ever been in. In addition to a stand up shower, there's also a huge jacuzzi tub. There's even a TV in the bathroom mirror, so you can entertain yourself while primping to go out! Talk about luxurious. 

Even though the hotel is a little bit off the strip, this isn't a problem at all. The drive is really less than a minute off the strip, and having no car isn't a problem either.

#1. In my option and my friends who I stayed there with, it would be nice to let your guests know there won't be ANY WATER the next morning you wake up. We didn't get ANY notice about how there was going to be work done so the water was going to be turned off for awhile. We had four people waiting to take a shower. GRRR!!! My friend had to call to see what happened and that's when's he was told what was going on. 

2. When we were checking everything out in our room and turning on all the lights, some of them weren't working. To me, shouldn't you check on those when cleaning the room and making it look nice for the next guest? So we had to call to have someone change out the bulbs and even @ that not all of them were changed! The bad ones, I mean. 

Besides those two issues, everything was great. The service @ the front desk was good. The people @ the valet were nice and friendly, easy to talk to. The room we had was just so nice. Big enough for the four us. There's a TV in the mirror of the bathroom! Lol. It's cool, cuz I like to listen to music while getting ready and so that just made my time there so much more awesome. We didn't get a room with two beds in it, so my boyfriend and I had the couch and a roll-in bed lol. It worked out though, it really did. I didn't mind @ all. That couch was actually nice to sleep on, enough room too. We stayed on the 44th floor. There's 52 floors. The only thing was our room faced the North Side of the Strip, and right now...there's not a whole lot going on on that side, so the view was boring. You see the city lights @ night and then this dark hole lol. But I hear a project is in the works, called Resort Worlds, so be on the look out for that in the next few years (2018, I hear) Oh and you also see what was supposed to have been the Fountainebleau Hotel (big tall blue tower, on the right middle side) just standing there looking sad.

I also like how there isn't a casino here and non smoking!!! Major plus for me since me and smoke don't get along. Also it's right across the street from the Fashion Show Mall! 

There's a FREE shuttle that comes every 15 mins. It takes you to Caesars Palace and the Wynn only. There's only Valet parking and it's ""free"". Meaning you pay for it in the resort fee part. 

There's a bar and what I call a lounge area. There's a pool table too, I was there a lot lol. The swimming pool area is nice. The pool is simple, nothing like the pools @ Caesars Palace though lol The gym is small, but gets a workout done. There's a spa, but I didn't go inside, just passed by.

Overall, I really liked staying here and would stay here again, it's fancy and classy; but this being only my 2nd time in Vegas, I want to stay @ the other hotels too, just for the experience :] Thanks again though, Trump Hotel, for making my 2nd trip awesome!",2,0,1

Vegas, here we come! My friends and I arrived to an elegant-looking lobby. It's not as big as Bellagio's lobby but it looked nice. There was a short wait to get checked-in and when we got to the front, the staff member was very friendly and completed the transaction efficiently in a timely manner.

We flew in so traveling by Uber was convenient at the front of the hotel. There's a place for people to wait for their rides. We checked-in to a suite and the bathroom was huge! It had a bathtub and shower with a mini washer too. Inside the mirror was a built-in TV so we were entertained while getting dressed and making ourselves look good for dinner. In addition to the suite were the usual kitchenette, small dining area, and living room space. We also received complimentary water bottles daily.

Our weekend stay at the Trump Hotel was nice although we were out most of time; it's Vegas, that means party time. The only problem we encountered was the power outage in the bedroom. We had to call someone to fix it. Someone came by quickly and resolved it but was waiting for a tip. I didn't tip him considering I JUST arrived and it wasn't working. We weren't the ones who messed with the room. Shouldn't everything be up and going, ready for us already? He lingered a bit before leaving.

When I see the Trump name on a property, I have a reasonable expectation that from the time I step foot on the property until the time I leave my experience will be a cut above the competition to put it mildly. Unfortunately this is one Trump property that has not impressed me, and it's all about attention to detail. 

1: Valet. When you pull up the service is great. But when I was ready to go I understand I need to wait and be patient. When I walk up to the valet please take the time to acknowledge that I am there and say I will be with you in a minute. Don't leave me standing there for a couple of minutes without saying anything to me. 

2: The lobby is typical Trump...polished to perfection with nothing out of place and top notch service. If only the rest of the property looked as good. 

3: Welcome to the 64th floor. Make sure you look down. I'm not talking about standing at the window looking down at the view below. I'm talking about making sure you avoid stepping into one of the 2-3 floor outlet covers that were half missing. If you have someone accompanying you in high heels, this was a safety hazard. For a property like the Trump surely someone could afford to purchase replacement electrical outlet covers and replace the broken ones instead of covering them by strategically placing tables over the damaged outlets. 

4: I don't expect white glove service. But if the walls are painted white I expect them to be clean. When you open the door to a penthouse suite I don't expect to see dirty, grimy doors especially in the area around the door handles. Or scratches. Or a hole in the wall opposite of the door. 

5: Service. One should not have to keep asking if a manager on duty can come up to address minor issues. I know they have other matters to attend to but when one of the people in your group has to make repeated requests to call a manager.... it's ridiculous. 

On a positive note there were no issues with food service, and the bartender was a pleasure to work with and certainly knew his stuff. 

Overall while the view from the 64th floor is nice, the Trump Hotel - Las Vegas is a property that I do not look forward to visiting again when it comes to attending a special event. If I want the true Trump experience I'll wait until I go to Chicago. Granted the Chicago property is relatively new, but their attention to detail is impeccable, and the level of service is stellar.

This deal also included a $50 SPA credit from hotels .com.  I booked this hotel because it was the cheapest rate for the highest customer rating on hotels .com.

After arriving at Trump Hotel, I was also advised of an additional $15 resort fee, which includes parking, pool, and gym.  

I liked the fact that there was no smoking and there's no gaudy casino design in the hotel.  The hotel itself can be seen as far south as the touristy Las Vegas sign.  It makes me wonder if Mr Trump picked that location for that fact.  It's the only hotel to be seen from the Las Vegas sign besides Mandalay Bay (but that's at the south end of the strip).

The rooms itself were pretty nice for $89 a night.  There is a stove, pots, pans, silverware, plates, cups for the frugal or families.  The bathroom has a jacuzzi with a separate shower & toilet sectioned off behind opaque glass.  I really enjoyed the TV in the mirror.

My room had a king size bed.  There is a couch which pulls out into a queen size bed.  Each room gets 2 small bottles of water.

The hotel is about a 5 minute walk west from the Wynn hotel.  My friends were staying at the Wynn hotel at a discounted rate, and I still believe my room is better for what I paid versus what she paid for her room.

I would definitely return back to this hotel for the price and cleanliness of the hotel.  Thanks!",2,0,2

Do your research, look for photos online, rest assured.

Considering a very busy July 4th, sold out, overbooked Las Vegas hotels, the Trump staff worked systematically, efficiently, and professionally.

I will definitely take my family back for a much longer stay in Las Vegas.

Honestly this hotel is one of the nicest I have ever stayed at.  Everything felt new and clean.  A full kitchen is in every room with a lot of living space as well.  The king sized bed was probably one of the nicest I've ever laid in but my boyfriend and I got demoted to the pull out full size bed.  Honestly it actually wasn't that bad and housekeeping will set the bed up for you if you like.  The bathroom was amazing as well with a tv in there for you as you get ready. haha... Two sinks, a bathtub, shower, and a separate area for the toilet.  It was rather amazing and definitely did a good job of accommodating a pack of girls that needed to get ready for a night out.

For as beautiful as this hotel is the real downside to the entire experience was the fact that it was a bit off the strip.  The strip was about a 10 minute walk which wasn't so bad but in the desert heat I can imagine that feeling a lot longer.  Although it did offer a tram ride to and from the Treasure Island that service stopped around 10 or midnight i believe.  While I'm a fan of not smelling like cigarettes when I walk into a hotel lobby the fact of the matter is that there wasn't really anywhere to go if you got bored except for the mall since there is no casino.  But for people in Vegas who just got back from clubbing at 3 AM the mall isn't really an option.

A friend and I stayed at the Trump International this past weekend 7\/26\/13-7\/28\/13, we enjoyed out stay the room was AMAZING! The view wasn't that great but we weren't in it enough to really care. I liked that is did not have a casino so it was nice and quiet when you came back to just rest. It is a towards the end of the stip across from the Wynn and Fashion Show Mall but if you enter through the MAcys' or Nordstrom's you don't even notice it. Also if you driving it's just off of a main road so that you can go around everything if you want to get to the other end of the strip quickly. We only hada few concerns\/complaints about the hotel. They are:

1) The cell phone recperion was TERRIBLE we each have different carriers andeven if we connected to the hotel's wi-fi we could not access any of our applications, calling in or out was spotty and text messages took for ever to go through. But as soon as we left the property everything worked fine. They should look into fixing that. 

2) We had breakfast on Saturday mornign at the resturant and for the prices we exptected better quality. Neither of us finished our food. 

3) When we left she noticed that the Valet's changed a couple of the setting on her car nothing major but still irritating 

4) When we checked in on Friday afternoon they only had 3 employees at the front desk the line got a bit long. You would think that they would have more staff working the desk for check-ins on a Friday afternoon.

Trump Las Vegas will make you feel like your pockets are much deeper than they actually are. Ultimately luxury prevails throughout this property.
It IS off the strip, but it's really not that far. I did not utilize the shuttles because it's literally a 4-5 minute walk to the strip, less if the mall is open. The convenience of no casino allows easy navigation throughout and lets you get to your room easily. And as others have mentioned, everything in this place smells phenomenal.
The rooms are very well-appointed and almost TOO big for a Vegas hotel room! You could comfortably fit 5 people in a King 1-bedroom suite.
We booked via Jetsetter and I thought we had a standard room but apparently the one-bedroom suite is a bit bigger than the standard studio suite. It was very reasonable priced with the deal we got. 
The room is just astounding. Once you walk in, a full kitchen, dining area, and living room with a L-shaped couch greets you. The full kitchen has a dishwasher and a FULL FRIDGE! The kitchen is not stocked with dishes or cookware per local law but they can send up anything you need. We needed a corkscrew and it was delivered within 10 minutes. 
The living room also has its own FULL bath, with a single sink and big shower.
The bedroom is MASSIVE with floor to ceiling windows and the most comfortable bathrobe I've ever worn. The bed is very comfy as well. Inside the bedroom is the master bathroom (yes, TWO bathrooms in the 1-bedroom suite!) which is probably bigger than the master bedroom in my apartment in LA. The bathroom features a jetted Jacuzzi tub that is actually much larger than a standard tub (see Palazzo\/Venetian) and fits two! The vanity is spacious with two sinks and a stool for the ladies. The shower stall is huge as well with two separate shower heads! Toilet is in a separate enclosure but the wall doesn't go to the ceiling so fumes may still be an issue. 
The staff was all extremely friendly and professional and I had no issues whatsoever with noise or any inconveniences.

My favorite thing about this hotel is that it does not have any gambling and therefore there is no cigarette smoke that's going to make its way into my room!

We stayed in a one bedroom suite that had absolutely everything we could meet. They did not service the room because we were only there for 3 days which was absolutely perfect with us and we had everything we needed for the 3 days including coffee pods. There was bottles of water in the room that were complimentary as well.

The bathroom was absolutely amazing and I love the jacuzzi tub! Plenty of towels and very yummy smelling shampoo and conditioner. And they're not super tiny size either.

We went out to eat one day for breakfast and was thinking that room service would be not so good or high-priced. But that was just not the case the food was super yummy it was hot it was fresh and it was reasonably priced!

The shuttle will take you for free too Caesars Palace. Which worked out great for us because we just walked everywhere we wanted to go from there. We never used our car after our first breakfast outing. The driver was very nice and gave us a lot of information about Las Vegas. This saved us lots of money in Uber and Taxi and we could drink!

This hotel is not connected to anything (i.e., no casino or shops), although there is a nice restaurant and bar in the lobby that serves Starbucks coffee.  Crossing a small street in 100+-degree weather to access the mall became annoying after a while.  Other 5-star hotels on the strip (e.g., Wynn, TheHotel, Bellagio) are interconnected to other hotels and\/or shops and a plethora of restaurants, thus allowing one to remain completely indoors if one so chooses.

In a three resort vacation trip, we stayed at Hyatt, Marriott, and Trump international.  We rate first two 4.5 star and trump 1 star.  Even at budget places we did not have stopped up toilets and flooding washing machines labeled in centigrade temperatures.  Sorry for worst ever review but we advise anyone going for a Las Vegas timeshare via Hilton resorts to go elsewhere.    And we live President Trump and are republicans.  But someone needs to audit this resort even though the building and lobby look beautiful.  Lastly, the staff were very polite.  But the constant tip needs took away from our visit.

1) it took 15 min... MINIMUM to get our car, we were waiting for a half hour wtf is that?
2) we told them our TV wasn't working and they said they were going to send in a tech... as you can probably tell that never happened.

Not that I smoke but my friends that did had to leave the room, get in the elevator, walk through the lobby, and through the front doors before they could smoke. Most people probably wont care about that, but I'm sticking with either the Cosmo, or Palazzo. This hotel doesn't feel like Vegas.

The hotel is beautiful. The lobby is nicely decorated. Staff is super friendly and helpful in giving directions to how to get to where you want to go. Valet comes with the resort fee. The room I got was upgraded with the $$ between the ID and credit card trick. Upgrade from a regular room to a suite for $80\/night thanks to Priceline. 

We checked out the pool and gym. Both great amenities for this hotel. The pool had an abundance of loungers with large umbrellas to shelter from the sun. The cabanas could be reserved. Along the outer 1\/3 ends on either side of the pool there was a ledge for you to sit and relax in the pool and get out of the Vegas Summer heat. The pool is very kid friendly. The deepest part was just 4' and each side of the large pool had an area just a foot deep for toddlers to splash and play. I didn't have my kids with me for this trip, but I would come with them here on our next trip. 

In the suite there was a single cup brew Keurig type coffee machine that came with coffee, cream, and sugar next to the machine with to-go cups for your on-the-go morning coffee needs. As well as a mini refrigerator and standard microwave. 

The bed, pillows, and comforter were so comfy. Didn't want to get out of bed in the morning. We had a great view of the strip from our room on the 47th floor. 

The bathroom had a soaking jacuzzi tub as well as standing shower and a TV in the mirror! That was pretty cool. Spacious marble counter with his and her sinks. 

In the bottom drawer of the dresser there is a safe for you to use to keep your valuables free of charge. You set your own code to use it. 

There is no casino in this hotel, but I personally really like that. I like to come back and not have to stroll through a maze of blinking lights and loud sounds as I am trying to wind down for the night. The whole strip has a plethora of places to gamble. I feel not having a casino in the lobby makes the Trump hotel more homey feeling when you get back from a day of activities. Which is really relaxing to me. I would definitely stay here again.",2,0,0

It's a decent enough hotel, but could be a decent enough hotel anywhere. In Las Vegas I've come to expect a bit more, and this isn't a bit more. It seems to think it's a 4 star hotel, but I found it to be little more than a LaQuinta with a minibar. I ordered two coffees in the restaurant and was charged $30 for Starbuck's coffee that sells for $5 in their stores. The food at the restaurant was okay, but of medium quality. The room was small by Vegas standards. Overall, it's essentially a LaQuinta, with a Denny's, but at 4 star prices.",2,1,0

The gentleman at the front desk was friendly, courteous and helpful. Especially after the HORRID experience I had just had with Budget Car Rental (to be Yelp'd soon!)!

Full Stainless Steel Fridge
Flat top electric stove and oven
Dishwasher
Microwave Oven
Cuisinart Toaster and Blender
Williams Sonoma Utensils
Glasses and plate settings
Small Bar area with sink
Counter top with bar stools and seating for 2

3 total TV's- a 46"" Flat Screen in the living area another approx.27"" in the bedroom and a final approx. 12"" in the bathroom mirror. 
2 Bathrooms- One in the living area with a sink, toilet and shower. The other main bathroom had a dual shower, double sinks, vanity table and a HUGE jacuzzi tub.

I could live in this place! I don't mind the lack of casino as I'm not a gambler. When in Vegas my friends and I are usually trying out the many fabulous restaurants, doing some shopping on the strip and at the outlets or trying out a club\/lounge. 

I thought it was a beautiful hotel, no amazing views and yes it is a bit off the strip amongst a lot of undeveloped land. But I'm not in the hotel the majority of the time and I don't sit gazing out of the window for hours on end. While the view doesn't compare to Mandalay Bay's, the room more than made up for it for me. I had also read here that many reviewers heard trains but I never heard one. Perhaps because it was the weekend? It was pretty peaceful. 

Also to note, we had been out late on Saturday night and when I called on Sunday morning for late checkout they allowed us to check out at 4PM at no additional charge! Awesome!

 Ethel, our front desk rep. was very professional, friendly, and extremely informative. She did not leave any important information out, and was patient with us as well.  Overall customer service here is astonishing. 


The room that we originally stayed in was a one bedroom suite, like I had mention before, Ethel the front desk rep. helped us upgrade to a Penthouse suite for a really good deal! Which right away, my boyfriend, and I could not let that offer slip. We took the offer right away! Come on, Penthouse suite?? For just the two of US? Why, yes please!

GOOD: Can blast music super loud, and no one would complain about any noise. BAD: Very quiet. Kinda felt bad for blasting music, but come on it felt like we had the whole floor to ourselves. All in all it was quite an experience. Will return back in the future. :)",0,2,0

Resort fee made up for the difference between this and a hotel that was on the strip, so that was a lost cause.  Free valet (just like every other hotel).  The rooms were large and clean, the bathrooms had a TV in the mirror, a Jacuzzi tub, and separate toilet\/shower areas.  The bed was comfy, there was a mini-keurig, and the air-conditioner worked (after returning from a trip across Europe, a large room cool room was welcomed).  The stairwell was lonely and the stairs felt flimsy (thin ironwork, paint on wall not finished). The pool area was nice, the jacuzzi in the corner was awesome (glad that it was hidden from plain view), and the drinks were reasonably priced.  Yes everyone at the pool was in shape, yes the music was too loud, but it was still a very nice pool area, and we didn't seem to mind.  I really can't find anything I did not like about the hotel itself.  

The location, yes, about a 5 minute walk from the strip, and the sidewalk disappears if you walk on the north side of Fashion drive. The shuttle runs until 2 Am but only goes to Caesars or Wynn; we took a cab as it was faster and we could go wherever.  Did not try their overpriced restaurant, and did not get to even sit at the bar (which closed at 12 midnight on Saturday night, fail).

Rooms:  The suites (which were an upgrade) have a kitchen (nice), but no cookware, glasses, or utensils. So what good is a kitchen without any of the amenities.

It is slightly off strip directly across from the mall.  So it is refreshing to not have the smoke of a casino.  But strangely, I missed the casino vibe.

Also you are located close to fashion show mall, which can be convenient for various reasons.

Speaking of location this is located at the North end of the strip, but if you're in Vegas you're going to do your share of walking anyway.

I've never stayed at places like Bellagio or the Wynn because it's too expensive.  The Trump is an awesome hotel - you get the luxury for about half the price of other fancy hotels.  

The GOOD:
-The scent!  The very first thing you notice is the wonderful scent in the air...like gardenias.  It is literally a breath of fresh air and instantly takes you away from what you'll normally smell in Vegas - cigarette smoke.

-Beautifully decorated!  Everything is lovely here...all the marble, the gold, crystal lighting, etc.  

-All rooms are suites with kitchenettes!  Rooms have one bed and a pull out sofa.  Nice sitting area, TV and a kitchenette in the standard suite.  Has an electric range, small fridge (great for drinks, water & leftovers), a coffee maker, toaster and microwave.  Cups, plates, bowls and utensils are provided and you can request pots and pans to cook with.  I love that we can keep our own food & drink cold and then reheat if needed.

-The best bathroom!  The shampoo, conditioner & lotion were great...had the same amazing scent as the rest of the hotel & I took them home.  Large & impeccably clean bathroom...shower was awesome, toilet had is own door but walls\/door were translucent; two sinks, giant mirror WITH A TV IN IT!  The bathroom also has a giant jacuzzi bath tub - easily fits two & you can have a relaxing bath while watching TV in the mirror.  This was the absolute best part. =)

-Staff was extremely friendly and courteous.  When checking in, we got a strip view upgrade to the room without asking (yay!).  The security, the doormen, the concierge, the valet guys and the shuttle guys were all so wonderful - never had such great service at any other hotel.


The MEH:
-Valet only; even though valet is free, it's sort of a pain to wait for your car.  Then everytime you get your car, you have to tip too.  I wish there was self-parking although it's not a dealbreaker for me at all.

-Hotel is not on the Strip BUT the hotel is literally across the street from Nordstrom's at the Fashion Show Mall (entrance maybe 50-100 ft. away).  You can cut through the mall and then go out to the strip OR the Trump provides shuttles.  One shuttle travels to the Wynn (the closest hotel) every 10-15 minutes while another shuttle travels to Caesar's Forum Shops every 30-45 minutes.  These actually are very useful.  A lot of times we'd think we would have to walk to the strip but the shuttle was always there to take us - we actually never ended up walking but if we did, it would probably take an additional 10 min. to do so.

-Resort fees.  I hate resort fees...I try to book hotels with no resort fees OR book hotels with internet included in the resort fee (some hotels charge the fee & give no internet!).  Trump's fee is $19.95 per night and includes two bottled waters each day, newspaper, fitness facility, pool, shuttle use & internet.  I didn't mind paying it and getting these things but we only got the paper one day; everything else was available to us. I took all 6 waters and used that shuttle every day, along with the internet.

-Charging tax on resort fees.  Really?  You're already charging me more than the price of the room and you're taxing it too?  I don't think other hotels have taxed the resort fee.


The only real thing that bothered me was the tax on the resort fee but other than that, everything else was perfect.  I loved staying here!  It was a very relaxing stay and without a doubt, I will look to stay here again.",7,2,2

We stayed for 3 nights Nov19-21 and each night we had a different room, why you ask, because of the faulty switches in the spa tubs. The first handicap room we were placed in had a tub shower combo, the tub did not work at all, the shower head literally came up to our waist. (when I have stayed in other hotels and been placed in an accessible room, the staff has always had the courtesty to ask if this was ok). The tub in this room did not work at all. The next room we moved to the tub worked for about 5 minutes before it was obvious that water was in the switch, not wanting to move again, I thought I will just try again later, maybe the switch will dry out. It did not. We called the front desk and they sent maintenance up who told us they ran out of switches about a week ago??? Finally the third room we got to had an operable unit, but also a cracked swtich so I doubt it will work for the lucky party that gets the room next. Also, there was blue contractors tape in the room, highlighting where things needed to be touched up. The bell stfaf who gave us the keys to this room literally played door bell ditch, handing us the keys and trying to run off without giving us the room number. Several other notes, the parking is valet only which is great expect you get your car back with bird poop all over it. Also I asked the bell staff for champage glasses after our first room move. I tipped him and he said no problem, guess what, never got any glasses. This is a beautiful hotel and my mom and I stayed when they first opened and the service was immpecable. I realize the economy is bad and they have had too do some downgrades, (rooms stocked with less equipment, no water at check in or from valet, no more truffles at night, personal letters or slippers in the room, but you can't be a 5 star without the service. Again, the rooms a beautiful and  you can beat the value, but the service sucks, and moving to a new room daily...not so relaxing. On our final night, at about 1020pm, we srpung out of bed to an alarm from security , with a man on loudspeakers directly into the room announcing everything was all clear, this announcement went off another time about 20 mins later , a little alarming considering we didn't get any previous announcements stating a problem. Was there a fire in the building and we should have already been downstairs, were there armed gunman in the hallways. I know this sounds a bit dramatic  but we honestly wondered these things based on the announcement and when we finally got thru to the hotel operator (phones were jammed) she said nothing other that everything was fine now. Maybe I should be thankful I got out alive.",2,1,0

The suites do not have more than one bed (the pullout sofa bed does not count).  The pullout bed was the most uncomfortable thing I have ever slept on.  You would think that a place with the name Trump on it would invest in more comfortable sofa beds, especially in a city where more than two people usually share a room.  

They do however try to accommodate you by bringing up extra cushioning for the bed but it does not help, you can still feel the metal bars digging in strange places of your body while trying to lay down. Which therefore makes it impossible to fall asleep, unless you're blackout drunk.

The rooms however are so nice and the bathrooms are fancy as all get up.  The rooms have kitchenettes (Trump was actually going to make these condo's before turning it into a hotel) and the bathrooms have little TVs.

The location of the hotel is right after the Wynn and right before old school vegas starts (i.e.  the sahara, fremont street, stratosphere, etc.). In other words, ONE HELL OF A WALK.

There is no casino here which makes this very classy and less noisy.  The elevators are extremely fast which can make you kind of woozy if you are inebriated.

Accommodating front desk staff. I reserved two rooms & they ensured both were on the same floor & had the correct number of beds I specified. A different front desk gal changed our check-out time from 11am to 1pm without making me feel I was asking for her first born the way other hotel employees make me feel. 

Spacious rooms. Reminded me of condo living with tons of closet space, kitchen counter, sizable fridge, modern art. Comfy-enough beds. Great temperature without having to fuss with thermostat. 

Amenities aren't impressive. Soap left a weird, velvety residue on my hands, & shower gel\/shampoo aren't super high end, but I liked the sleek, black packaging. Large shower. Toilet enclosed in its own glass room. 
 
Fantastic pool! Humongous, less than 4 feet all the way across, warm, clean. Pool area is surrounded by cozy beds & plenty of lounge chairs, but had no showers. 

Loved not having to walk through a smoky casino. 

$29\/day resort fee, a fee most hotels charge now. I assume this fee covers wifi, free water bottles, & the cool keurig machine.

My mom is convinced that the lobby smells like dog pee, but I'm pretty sure it's just the sickly sweet smell of the flowers in the middle of the lobby. There's not very much grass in the immediate area surrounding the hotel, but if you exit the lobby and walk to the left, you'll find a little faux grass area with doggy bags.

Pros:
- No casino, no smoke!
- Suite style rooms with kitchen area (stove, utensils, pots, plates, etc.)
- Pet friendly!
- Across the street from Fashion Show Mall
- Shuttle to Wynn and Caesar's

Cons: 
- Valet parking only-- this makes the turnaround area in front of the hotel super crowded and difficult to access. Protip: Just park at the Fashion Show Mall parking lot across the street and walk...
- Not directly on the strip, but this can be a pro and con, depending on your interests. Plus, the shuttle does help.
- So many problems with our bill:
We noticed a random charge on our bill when we were checking out, so we talked to the front desk about it and they took it off. Got home, looked at credit card statement, saw that we were STILL charged more than what our bill had said. Called Trump customer service and were told that they added a charge back on because they had to tax our pet fee? And they also charged us for an extra day?? But they said they would give us credits for the next time we stay at Trump and that they would confirm this by sending us an e-mail. Three or four days go by and still no e-mail, so we call again and finally figure things out. Way more hassle than it should have been. BUT all the staff who we met at the actual hotel very lovely people.

tl;dr: Nice hotel, decent rooms, no smoke filling the lobby (yay!), location is ok, depending on how close to the strip you actually want to be, but customer service by phone could be better",5,1,0

First off, this hotel isn't on the strip.  It's about a 10 minute drive from the strip.  There aren't any casinos in the hotel so it doesn't get as rowdy or crazy compared to the other hotels.  The rooms were very quiet and while staying in the rooms, it doesn't feel like being in ""Las Vegas"".  

The rooms are big and the bathroom is also big.  Do watch out for the shower area because the floor does get slippery and the warm water takes a while to warm up when taking a shower.  

Breakfast at the hotel wasn't too great, so I recommend going to other breakfast joints around the area.  

Be wary of the resort fee that's mandatory.  It's $25 and it's added to just about all the 4+ star hotels in Vegas.  Pain in the rear end.",5,0,0

We stayed in a studio with a view of the Encore and Wynn hotels. If you want to stay somewhere in Vegas without the smoking and the casino traffic, I highly recommend Trump. 

This place is beautiful! From the very moment the complimentary (might I add, mandatory) valet drives your car away and you step in, you're in complete awe. The beautiful chandeliers, the arrangements, everything. It's contemporary, it's classy, it's Trump Las Vegas. Check in was quick, easy, and soon enough we were on our way to our room. The studio was huge, and the bathroom was gigantic! Jetted tub that can fit 2 very comfortably, a large shower on the opposite end of the bathroom, a mirror with a TV in it (you read that right), and of course your toilet. We also had a kitchenette, with an electrical plate, a kettle, coffee maker, microwave, fridge, etc. There is also a very nice seating area near the window that was great. I just wish they have the larger sofa facing the window so we can see all the lights and the strip! The mattress was very comfortable, king size. 

We ordered room service twice. Both times we received excellent and prompt service! The second time we had called, we had a special request which the employee informed me they normally do not do but granted it to us anyways. Can I say awesome?! They always quoted 30 minutes to an hour, but both times we got our orders within 25 minutes or so. The bottle of wine we had ordered was great, I just wish I could remember the name. I recommend trying at least one from their in-room dining menu if you do stay here.

At the lobby, there is a lounge area with a bar and some pool tables to the side. It has a very intimate feel to it, which I loved especially at night. We did have some drinks and a shot at the bar which were priced decently. Nothing to expensive. The bartender was quick and friendly. They do serve food down there as well but we didn't try any.

If you are driving here, please keep in mind that there is NO self parking. It is all valet, so you may want to hang on to some cash so you can tip. The guys at the valet are really quick and great. When we had been drinking, we had requested a taxi a couple of times instead of our car. Immediately after, we were already in the cab and off on an adventure! Remember, don't drink and drive.

The strip is literally right there, like a couple minutes of walking and boom! The mall is directly in front of the hotel as well. You can see Macy's, Nordstroms, and Forever 21 from the front. Everything is pretty much in walking distance, you may just want to bring some walking shoes. 

Anyways, I hope some of you find my review useful in some way. If you do stay at Trump, have a great time!!",10,2,1

Quick summary:
 - Very unhelpful managers.  I had an issue with my booking and I ended up having to talk to the front desk 3 times, Priceline twice. I felt like the manager Maddy was telling me completely different information than Priceline and was trying to make it harder for me to resolve the issue.
- Dated room with no five star amenities
- Rooms with stains on the floors and not clean (for example, the soap dish on the counter had not been cleaned)
- Noisy rooms with horrible views.  They played us on a high floor but with the cheap glass we can still hear the highway noise below us.  Plus, we just have a view of a construction sight.
- Bad location off strip with no nearby casino
- Free WiFi blocks VPN connections.  I didn't realize this and had to spend 30 minutes on the phone with tech support to get upgraded to allow VPNs so I could actually do work.
- No real effort to try to win me back.  I made it plain that I was unhappy with their service and there was nothing done to try to make it up to me.

Obviously, I had a bad experience.  At the root of it was a mistake I made.  I own up to that.  I had booked through Priceline.  I thought I was going to be guaranteed a hotel with a casino, but it turns out Priceline does not do that.  Within an hour of booking it, I called Priceline to see if I could cancel because we really wanted to have a casino where we were staying.  Priceline told me they called Trump but Trump denied the cancellation.  I understand that you get what you get with Priceline, but still, was it really a big issue for them seeing how I had booked it within the hour?  I offered to pay a $100 cancellation, but they said they would charge me the full two night stay.

Ok, so not making sure I was guaranteed a casino was my problem.  But, what happened after that was Trump (and to a degree Priceline's) fault.

I went over to Trump to discuss the case after speaking with Priceline.  After waiting in line, I spoke with a representative.  She informed me that Priceline never called them. She said they would be fine with the cancellation but that it was up to Priceline to refund my money since it was they who charged me.   So, this made me frustrated thinking that Priceline has lied to me.  I called Priceline back but they did say firmly they had called Trump and even gave me the name of the person they spoke with Maddy.  They also said that it was really up to Trump since the money for my stay had already been given to them.  

So, I had to get back in line, and talk to the check-in person at Trump again.  Turns out the manager's name was Maddy, so Priceline did probably call them.  It sounds like Maddy just didn't update my record to reflect the conversation she had with them.  So, this made me look like an idiot when I accused Priceline of not actually talking to them.     Pushing them more, it turned out that yes, it was up to Trump to either deny or allow the cancellation... not Priceline like I was originally told by Trump.  They informed me they would allow the cancellation, but not the refund.  That was actually presented like it solved my problem.  I would be out $700 for the two night stay, but hey, at least the reservation would be canceled.

Again I offered to pay a $100 cancellation fee.  The check-in clerk got Maddy on the line and after some discussion they said they could offer refunding one night, but not both.  So, I would still be out $300.  I have to admit, half of me was tempted to just take the money and walk out because I was so frustrated with this.  But, I really wasn't going to be happy with losing $300.

In the end, I just kept the reservation.  However, I kind of regretted that after seeing the room and the amenities.  This is not a five star hotel.  The rooms are dated, there is a lot of highway noise in the room, the view is horrible (not having strip).  The rooms don't have any of the fancy features you expect from luxury rooms such as USB chargers, spa-feeling bathrooms, etc.

The further frustration was the WiFi.  I had to get work done which required a VPN connection.  When I signed onto the WiFi I just took the normal level access (the complimentary one) .. but it turns out that doesn't allow for VPN.  It turns out you have to pay $3 a day to get VPN access.  Who does that these days?  Not a luxury hotel.  I did go down and ask to at least com'ed the $3 for the WiFi given my experience and how they said they would like to do something for me.  But, then their WiFi setup was so horrible that I couldn't undo the complimentary access to select the business level access.  I ended up having to literally call tech support and be on the line for 30 minutes while they reset the preferences for my IP address.",6,2,1

Lice living area, full kitchen and bedroom.  Oversize jetted hot tub.  The restaurant is sorely lacking.  Nothing special about the menu or food and it is way overpriced for what it is..  You feel like you are dining in an extension of the lobby.  Was unable to be seated for breakfast for over a 25 minute wait because tables were not cleared and bar was full.  The hostess and staff did not seem to be in a hurry to get them cleared either.  As a former restaurant worker, I was appalled at the lack of service and accommodation.  I chose to eat elsewhere.  As a frequent Las Vegas Visitor, trust me when I say, there are much better choices.  I will not be returning to this hotel.  Oh, by the way, I like Donald Trump and even voted for him.  I hope he runs the country better than his hotels.  Have a great day!",0,1,0

The lobby smells delightfully fresh with a scent of what I thought was jasmine but turns out you can buy the stuff in the gift shop and it's green bamboo.  Plenty of doormen dressed in suits and over-the-top-willing to help each and every time.  Amazing.  Check in was nothing short of perfectly pleasant.  I love that they offer a business center to use for free, which is great for printing your boarding passes.  I love that the shower is about 5x5 with perfect water pressure.  I love that the jetted tub could hold 3-4 people.  I love that there is a tv in the mirror.  The shower and separate pot are behind heavy, slightly privatized glass.  Marble everywhere.  I love the hair dryer; I'm going to get one.  (Andis ionic)  I love the little Subzero fridge, Bosch microwave, and small Wolf 2-burner stovetop.  We had no use for the Wolf, but having had a huge breakfast at Hash House, it was cool to be able to refrigerate the leftovers and reheat for dinner.  There are dishes for anything you might need.  I love the kitchen shears, must find them too.  Our room faced the mountains, Stratosphere, an ugly, seemingly-abandoned parking garage project, and the train (which was not obtrusive at all.  Only heard it a couple times).  I love that there are not door hangers for Do Not Disturb or Housekeeping; there are buttons.  The room was behind double doors that share an entrance to 2 rooms.  This was fine but my goodness, what heavy doors!  Linens were all very nice, good quality.  Toiletries were very nice and were replaced daily, even though not needed at all.  

It is a bit of a remote location on the strip, but not bad at all.  Right across from Wynn and the big mall.  They offer free shuttles to Wynn and Ceasar's if you would like.  The one to Wynn is great, they drop you at the front door, but to Caesar's  you are dropped at the pit of that enormous place and will have a long trek to wherever you are going.  We just got a cab to get back because we didn't want to find it again, in heels after a long night.

All the rooms have 1 king bed.  I was traveling with my niece so would have preferred 2 queens, but she's young and wanted to sleep on the sofa, which she thought was very comfortable.  So it worked out fine.

And to top off a fantastic stay, we were drunk and hung over and barfing from a night of awesome partying (should I have said that?), forgot to reserve the shuttle back to the airport, but the awesome doormen offered a free ride in one of their Escalades (just give a nice gratuity).  THAT was wonderful.  The employees have fun there, love their jobs, and will not hesitate to help you.  

I can't believe the rate was so cheap.  This easily could have been a $500 room.  I'm not sure what their trick is to offer such low prices, but do take advantage of it.  It's a beautiful property with no trashy people, no smoke, and no casino.  I will definitely go back.  There is a $25\/day resort fee that includes all these amenities, plus 2 bottles of Trump water a day, newspaper of your choice, internet, and more.  Love it.",1,1,0

After all, Trump Hotel is considered an upper echelon hotel for most cities and I figured out the reason for the low hotel rates upon my arrival. The Trump is not located on the strip, it sits perpendicular to Encore, the new twin of the Wynn. You can easily cut across the Fashion Mall to get to the strip but if you don't like walking a lot or plan on getting drunk at the clubs, the Trump will cost you many round trip cab rides. The resort fee is ridiculous as well because amidst all the items that the resort fee supposedly covers, the only thing that stuck out to me were two bottles of water every day (not Fiji, it was some generic Trump brand) as well as a towel if you decide to use their pool. There was no turn down service, bar closed at around 11:00pm or 11:30pm and only one restaurant inside the entire hotel. To make matters worse, we had no water to shower the day we arrived for up to 6 hrs due to plumbing work. I understand plumbing issues are out of the hotel's control but there was no prior warning, signs as well as updates as promised. There were also a lot of rowdy teenagers staying at the hotel, it was probably due to low costs.",2,0,0

The Good:
The hotel is immaculate.  The room we had was gorgeous (layout is very similar to The Signature Suites at MGM.  It was a corner 1bdr suite on the 58th floor with a spectacular south facing view of the strip. There's an iPod docking station with an add'tl USB slot... perfect for charging multiple devices.  The hotel amenities were clean, peaceful, and easy to navigate to.  Beautiful pool, that thankfully wasn't over-crowded especially since it was J4th weekend.  A nice sized fitness center... there were plenty of treadmills and equipment... I never found myself waiting to use anything.  The spa was had a steam room and sauna that I was able to enjoy after booking a massage. 

There's a $20 resort fee added on to your bill but in my opinion is well worth it for what you get... 2 complementary bottled waters w\/every housekeeping visit... or you can call and request more water.  Complimentary drop off & pick up shuttle service to\/from the Wynn or Caesar's Palace.  Access to Pool, Spa, & Fitness Center.  FREE WI-FI.

Shuttle service came in handy and saved on cab fare (which means more gambling money!).  However, the shuttle to Caesar's ends at 11pm, so if you plan on staying out late, save a couple bucks for cab fare.


The Bad:
Our beautiful corner suite developed a horrible odor coming from the master bathroom... smelled like mildew.  We called front desk nearly every day to send someone up to take a look.  Turns out there was a leak in the laundry room which is locked off and only available for the owner(s) of the suite.  Maint. came to fix the leak and had to come again to run a wash cycle to get rid of the stale water left in the washer.  However, the smell never left the bathroom.  To prevent it from stinking up the suite, we kept the bathroom door closed and used the second bathroom in the living room to shower and get ready.  It was terrible that we couldn't make use of that huge master bathroom and spa tub.  Unfortunately, no one offered to have switch rooms until the night before we were checking out.  

Secondly, there's a train that passes by on the West side of the hotel near the 15 fwy that you can hear very clearly even from the 58th floor!!  We were in early one night and awoke at 3:30 am to a train passing by blowing his horn!  Rude awakening.


Other things I thought that might be good to know.... 
Pillows are way too soft for me,  your head literally sinks to through... but the bed was comfy.  There is NO CASINO in this hotel... this may be good or bad depending on what you're in LV for.  For the most part, not having a casino downstairs was great for our trip... it was less crowded (especially on J4th weekend) and peaceful.  There was one night I did regret it when I awoke at 4am (thanks train!) and could not get back to sleep.... then would have been a great time to have a casino conveniently located downstairs.  Nonetheless, figure out what you want out of your hotel during your trip before you book a non-casino resort.  Also, not sure if it was just our room, but the volume on the TVs were super super low.  I had to max out the volume just to hear anything.  Kitchenette and full Kitchens have a microwave & stove with dishware & utensils.... so if you wanna save some $$ on grub... walk across the street to the ABC Store inside Fashionshow Mall and buy some pre-made sandwiches, salads, etc... they even sell alcohol and you can store that in the fridge in the room!

We went for SEMA, so soaking in the tub after walking so many miles was the best remedy.  Also, BONUS TV in the bathroom mirror that you can watch while soaking in the tub.  The shampoo and conditioner they provide is the best I've ever had at a hotel.  My bf loved the conditioner and threatened to use it all himself.  I also loved the hair dryer, which is probably better than the one I use at home.

I ordered breakfast to my room and receive barely cooked poached eggs (literally, raw) and found a hair in my fruit salad. 

I complained to the front desk, and they took the meal off my bill, only after me having to really explain why I deserve to not have to pay for it. 

Then - I see the meal charge on my credit card. 

Mr. Trump - is this the service you intended to provide?

Rooms
Free and fast valet, and a beautiful lobby welcome you to the place. The elevator is super fast, and the rooms are awesome. The bathroom is huge, with a shower AND a giant bathtub. My room had two queen beds, which were super comfy, along with the average hotel things (safe, mini fridge, etc.).

Pool
The pool is awesome, it is really big so the pool is never really cramped, even on hot summer days. There are plenty of chairs, but it's a little hard to get a good and shady spot. 

Extras
This place is smoke-free, and has no casino, so I'd doesn't reek of cigarettes and is great if you aren't in Vegas for the casinos (and other casinos are a minute's drive away if you are). 
It's dog friendly. This probably can be annoying, but it was good for us since we have a puppy. It's not too big a deal, but as a dog owner, it's hard to find good and dog friendly hotels.

We were originally booked for a deluxe room with strip view but were offered a highly discounted penthouse so we took it. The penthouse would have been almost $3000 if I booked online but 3 nights was just over a grand. Amazing discount and so worth it! The penthouse was GORGEOUS!!! Huge living room, full kitchen with stove, oven, toaster, blender, microwave, full fridge, and even a dishwasher. I felt guilty we weren't cooking!

I got to stay at the Trump Hotel through Priceline after bidding on it.  I think I paid about $150 per room.  It was my first time spending so much money on a hotel, but it really was worth it.  This hotel was by far the best hotel experience for me and I'm still trying to find a hotel that will be just as good or even better. 

The Trump Hotel is off-strip, but not too far from it.  It's actually not too far of a walk to get to the strip, so you don't need a taxi if you're up for a little walk.  The Trump Hotel is everything Trump is ..basically meaning  lavished with gold. Gold is EVERYWHERE.  

I had the studio suite and it was really spacious.  It consisted of a king size bed (omg, SO comfortable and plushy), a flat screen tv, a living room area with a couch and table, and a small kitchen with a fridge and stove.  The bathroom was AMAZING.  Separate jacuzzi tub and shower and a small flat screen tv in the mirror in front of his and her sinks.  I would have been okay just being in Vegas and staying in the hotel room all throughout the trip. =)

The lobby has a very distinctive smell.  Don't get me wrong, it smelled really good!  We stayed when the temperature was so high (100+ degrees), so each time we walked into the lobby, we were greeted with air conditioning and a nice smell..much better than the hot weather and smoke from cigarettes everywhere outside on the strip.

The employees were very professional and nice.  They addressed everyone in my party ""Mr."" or ""Ma'am"".  You HAVE to pay for valet parking no matter what, but I was okay with it because we went in and out A LOT.  The valet parking guys were very nice, but we had to wait awhile for our car to arrive..it was okay, since we figured it was due to the Memorial Day weekend and the hotel was crowded).  The bellhop was great - he brought our luggage up right away and placed it wherever we asked in our room without any hesitations.  On our second and final night there, I asked the concierge for suggestions on events taking place.  She was very informative and suggested a lot of great places.  They also have an employee outside the elevator in front of the lobby to make sure only Trump hotel guests were allowed in for safety precautions at night.

Overall, a GREAT experience.  The Trump Hotel definitely shows other hotels what great customer service is all about.",0,0,0

We stayed here for the weekend and it reminded me of The Signature Suites at MGM.  At least the layout was similar.   Obviously Signature is nicer in every aspect and the rooms are larger but for the price Trump is a nice place to stay.

Room service was quick and I was happy with initial cleanliness of the rooms.

So I gave it a 3.5 star because:  I've stayed at a lot of the hotels in Vegas and this wasn't Wynn quality (5 star), Aria (4 star), TI etc (3 star), Luxor (2 star).

Granted, that's kind of what I wanted. I don't gamble (gasp!) so Trump appealed to me as a place where I could get away from the madness. 

The lobby is beautiful and I had a high floor room with a nice view of the mountains. Whatever, I paid $75 for the room so I wasn't expecting the Strip view. One weird thing was that I shared a foyer with another room: you accessed the door to the foyer with your key, then you accessed one of the two room doors again. I shared the foyer with a group of dudes getting their party on but luckily there wasn't too much noise. I didn't exactly feel unsafe but it was just an odd configuration.

Parts of the room, like the mattress that was 8 inches too short for the bed, were totally half-assed. Yeah, I work in the industry so I probably notice cheap carpet or unfinished elements before other people but only the most cracked out of guests (or the person who signed off on the furniture order) would miss the Grand Canyon at the end of the bed.

The empty lot next to the hotel is sketchy at times... As we were walking the 5 minutes from the Strip to the hotel at 10PM one night I remarked to my companion that this was the perfect place to get mugged. I was fine in the daytime but take a cab after dark.

The night of my arrival I was starved after not eating for 12 hours so I ordered a $20 burger from room service. It was terrible and I would have been better off eating that squished granola bar in my carry-on bag.

All staff was friendly - no attitudes here.

Super fast WiFi - probably the fastest I've ever experienced in a hotel - but it better be fast since that was basically the only amenity that I used that was covered by the $20\/night resort fee.

When I checked in, the representative was getting over a cold and kept wiping his nose after he turned around to sneeze. You can imagine how thrilled I was to get the contaminated key cards he handed me.
The room was so-so. All of the plates in the kitchen were dirty, which proved to be a hassle when I brought home a take out pizza.
The super-bright lights that light up the tower from below are way too much of a nuisance, even at the 30th floor level. Even the blackout curtains don't block out the light.
To get to the strip, you have to walk across a dangerous cross walk and then walk through a busy mall. Give yourself at least 20-30 min. to get to the closest hotel\/casino on the strip, Treasure Island.

First, the only parking is complimentary valet parking. Which is awesome. And makes you feel pretty legit, especially when you're not swanky enough to usually valet park your car. 

The girl that checked us in was very nice and very helpful. She made light conversation with us and was very polite. All of the staff that we came in contact with were the same way. And I really appreciated when we came in late one night, that they were checking everyone's room keys before they could get on the elevators. 

The hotel lobby was beautiful and well-kept. I really appreciated that there wasn't a casino attached because it made everything look that much classier and nicer. 

We just got the standard room but it was HUGE. King-sized bed, more closets than I have in my house, a kitchenette with a sink, mini-fridge, toaster, etc., and a sitting area with a couch and two chairs. And the BATHROOM. I have never in my life seen a bigger hotel room bathroom. A shower that could have easily fit ten people, a walled off area for the toilet, double sinks, a HUGE jetted tub, and a TV IN THE MIRROR. I felt like a queen. 

The only problem we had was the reception on the TV. About every three minutes, the picture would freeze and would stay that way for another minute or two. But when you're in Vegas, you don't spend much time laying around watching TV, so it wasn't a huge deal.

The hotel is located about a block off the actual strip, just down the street from the Wynn and Encore. In fact, we had a very nice view of the two hotels from our window on the 17th floor. Our group figured it would be best since we planned to club at XS on both Friday and Saturday night of our stay. Luckily for us, the hotel provides a round-the-clock shuttle to the Wynn that arrives every 15 minutes or so that will take you on a 5 minute ride down the block to the Wynn. Unfortunately for us, this service ends at 2am, so if you plan to stay at the club til it closes, you'll have to cab your way back since the ladies aren't about to walk back to Trump in their clubbing shoes.

As for the hotel itself, it was very nice. Fancy enough compared to some of the others but again, I didn't think it compared to some of the nicest ""true"" 5-stars in the area. If you've stayed at Aria, Vdara, Cosmopolitan, Venetian, and Palazzo, you know what 5 stars is like!

Parking is valet ONLY which for some should be a convenience, but was annoying for me because I had to tip every time I picked up my car and depending on the line, had to wait also. Our room had one king bed + a sleeper sofa (no double bed + sleeper sofa option available!), the sleeper had no sheets, and we were missing an iron+ironing board and had to call 5 times for them to bring one. Despite this, the room itself was very clean and the big king bed was very comfortable. Bathroom featured frosted glass doors for the shower and the toilet area so you could be going about your business if other people wanted to use the restroom at the same time to wash their hands, do their hair, etc. at the vanity. Not something you should do most of the time, but when everyone is trying to use the restroom at the same time to get to the club in time, you gotta do what you gotta do. Also, no casino or buffet downstairs was something of a negative in case you want to go down for a quick meal or to gamble a couple of bucks away. The positive side of this is that you don't get all the noise, sounds, and smells of having those things downstairs. Didn't get to see or use the gym or the pool area, but they did look nice in pictures. 

Would I recommend this place? If there are only 2 or 3 people in your group, this is a perfectly good place if you don't mind the distance and don't mind not having a casino or buffet downstairs. For the younger crowd that comes with an entourage, I suggest skipping this place and forking over the extra money for a nicer place with 2 double beds and the sleeper sofa. 

So overall...
The good: Bargain price compared to the other 5-star hotels, comfortable basic room is perfect for 2 people, 3 at most. For a bigger group, opt for a 1 or 2-bedroom suite. Quiet if that's what you're looking for in a Vegas hotel. Tacos El Gordo just down the street! Very good for late night munchies.
The bad: Valet parking only was somewhat inconvenient, not super close to other hotels\/resorts, no buffet or casino downstairs, no options for 2 double beds - one king bed only in a regular room.
The ugly: 5 calls to get an iron in our room - not cool if you have to iron your clothes before clubbing!",1,0,0

I spent a lot of my time at the Wynn, Caesar's, and Palazzo. You think it's just across the street but when you actually do the walk in the Vegas heat it seems like miles. The shuttle service was really nice, but only took us to Wynn and the back of Caesar's Palace shops. 

I actually liked the fact that this hotel didn't have a casino. The hotels with casinos all smelled like cigarettes, especially Harrah's. It was nice to go back to a clean and smoke free hotel. 

The pool area is a bit small but it didn't bother me so much. My one complaint is that there are limited umbrellas. So, if you want to relax without the sun blazing on you, you have to grab the umbrellas fast. However, I did like how cold the pool was. I was expecting a luke warm pool because of the heat but was surprised that the water was actually pretty cold!

I was in a spacious one bedroom city-view suite but the ""city-view"" just means the view of the liquor store and construction. This might bother you if you're into getting the ""good view"". So try to avoid ""city-view"" and try and get the ""strip-view"".

I probably won't stay here again because I want to be literally ON the strip so that I don't need a shuttle or taxi. But, I would recommend it for people who don't mind taking the shuttle or taxi to get to the middle of the strip. It was clean and the staff was very friendly.",1,0,0

I stayed here with a girlfriend during a trip to Vegas and was extremely pleased with how nice this hotel was (although, I guess that should have been expected since its a Trump Hotel).  The room I stayed in had a King bed with a pullout bed in the couch.  The bathroom was the size of my bedroom at home and I seriously could have slept in the tub, it was that big,  The room was modern with a small kitchenette and was well furnished with simple, yet elegant furniture.  What I liked most about this hotel was the fact that it didn't have any casinos or nightclubs in it, which helped add to the feeling of luxury and exclusivity,  

The only thing I didn't like that much was the fast that the shower and toilet were separated by glass window panes.  I didn't like feeling like I was on display if someone walked into the bathroom, but considering I shared the room with another girl, I guess it was okay.  Furthermore, something else I've never experienced before were staff members asking to see my room key to make sure I stayed at the hotel.  Obviously, its not a problem since I had my room key on me at all times, but it definitely felt a bit intimidating.

The toilet was separated by a frosted glass door within the bathroom.  Next to that there was a shower in a separate stall.  The view of the strip from the room was nice. There was a mini kitchen area which came in handy to store leftovers and chill drinks.  Only thing that was inconvenient was that you have to call if you want any kitchen supplies. There was a sign that explained there was a law that prohibits them from storing them in the room. Two complementary bottles of Trump water were supplied daily which came in handy since the weather was dry.  There was also a K-cup coffee maker and Lavazza Perfecto cups that were restocked daily as well.  I didn't really like the scent of the supplied soaps and shampoo since it was musky, but it was not a big deal for me since I brought my own. Location is directly across the street from the Fashion Mall which you can cut though to get to the strip.  It takes about 10 min to walk from the hotel to the strip.  Check in and check out went smoothly. I booked here through hotels.com which saved me some money since there was a promotion on that website and cash back via ebates.",0,1,1

(and it's a big BUT) How come nobody here has complained about the continuous train horn blowing at 11:00 PM, 12 AM 1 AM 2AM 4AM and 6AM until you wanted to just scream WTF!  It was horrible.  45 floors up and it was just like someone left the tv on full blast right by your head.  

No wonder they couldn't sell condos and had to make this a hotel.  Nobody could live there!  Maybe if you had a strip side room it wasn't so bad, but jeez, 2 nights there and I was definitely ready to go.

To Whom It May Concern,
We have been staying at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas since November 22, 2012 and have regretted staying in this supposed 5 star hotel since our first 20 minutes after checking in. Our first room, 4717, had missing handles on desk drawers, clogged jets in the jetted tub and the bathroom door had to be slammed in order to close. My partner accidentally locked the bathroom door and we had to call the front desk to get someone to unlock it, which took a few calls until someone finally came. He noticed the condition of the door and said he would have to remove it and they offered us a new room. When they sent up a bell hop to give us our new keys he gave us wrong directions on how to get to our new room sending us waltzing around the 34th floor looking for an elevator to take us to the 25th floor. 
Anyway at this point no big deal 20 minutes later we are in our new room, 2505. The new room is all fine and dandy and then I notice that the floor is just horrible. Long raised wrinkles all down the hallways where the carpet has started to pull away from the floor. The condition of the flooring is even worse in front of the elevator where the wrinkles have started to expose the underside of the carpet and lose threads and are raised high enough to create a tripping hazard. These are literally right in front of the elevator. The only things I can think of that lead to the condition of this carpet are; improperly installed, water damage or just excessive wear ( My entire family are Contractors who work in flooring and I have worked enough flooring jobs to know this is wrong).
We brought our concerns to the front desk manager, Mr. Andrews, who informs me that he will look into all of these deficiencies and offers us a $50.00 room credit which is basically one meal at trump (and not a good meal at that, more on this later). I sent Mr. Andrews pictures of the carpet and that was the last I have heard of it since. At this point I am annoyed because this ""5 star hotel"" comes with a 5 star price but not the quality of a true 5 star hotel. 
Now fast forward to November 24, 2012 and our breakfast here at trump and I am no longer annoyed I am pissed. I ordered the American breakfast with 3 eggs, potatoes and bacon. In the potatoes I find an enormous lump of seasoning which explains why everything tasted incredibly salty. I refused to eat the rest of my meal and they removed it from my ticket. 
Now one thing most people can agree about Mr. Trump is that he does believe in offering luxurious properties and services (and charging the price for it) but staying here I can tell you that this is crap! My partners first time in Vegas and believing we are staying in a top of the line hotel and we get this mess. Things happen and no one is perfect but the constant rate of failure here is more in line with a Motel 6 and their prices not  5 star status. I think this hotel's rating deserves to be downgraded and will never stay at any property in the Trump collection again and will recommend others stay away from them. I have stayed in hotels in 3rd world and developing countries and have been more satisfied than with them than this place. I would have checked out but our reservations are non-refundable so we are stuck here until we leave this Sunday.
 The only saving grace of this hotel is the staff. Mr. Jay, the man from the engineering division who came to fix our door, was very helpful in assisting us to our new room after the bell hop sent us the wrong way. He was also genuinely concerned about our situation. Also, Mr. Andrews who moved us to a new room was very apologetic and proactive in fixing our situation.
Thank you for your time,",0,0,0

I was a little dubious about staying off-strip with no casino (I'm not a gambler, but I love to wander the strip & the casinos & watch other people get over-served & squander their money).  In retrospect, staying here was absolutely a great move! 

We arrived at 10 AM, & despite the early hour (at which one would typically be informed that no check-in would be available until afternoon), the super nice staff were completely accommodating.  They not only provided us a room for immediate occupancy, but upgraded us to a suite with a killer view of the strip from the jacuzzi & a corner bedroom with 2 walls of windows, one overlooking the strip & one looking out at the mountains - gorgeous!  Very clean room, comfy bed, & all the amenities one could ask for - top of the line appliances (Wolf stove & oven, Sub Zero fridge, Bosch dishwasher - not that you'd want to cook or wash dishes in Vegas, but just in case), a HUGE bathroom with TV & telephone, separate toilet room in support of your dignity, a full second bathroom off the dining room, in-room safe, free wifi, free local calls, in-room coffeemaker, lighted his & hers closets, & the sweetest, plushest bathrobes EVER for lounging around between sexy times :)

As to the location, it really could not have been better.  The Trump is on a quieter side street but within easy walking distance of The Wynn and others for breakfast (Wynn breakfast buffet was really good) & casino action if you're inclined.  It's also right across the street from Nordstrom & Fashion Show Mall - super convenient for shopping & other retail needs during your stay.

There were only a couple of glitches during our stay, but nothing that ended up being a real problem for us:

First, there is a train track running right past the building, & even 50 floors up the train horn is REALLY loud. We are somewhat early risers, so not a horrible problem for us, but given jet lag & the late-night-first-day-in-Vegas-who-needs-sleep push of being awake almost 24 hours, I would have used my earplugs had I known.  After the first morning we were used to it, I suppose, because we slept right through it every other morning!

Second, & more randomly, after being awakened by the train on our first morning, we decided to take advantage of the tub with the great view. Once we were done with our soak, I had difficulty turning the spa off - the switch seemed out of sync with the power.  After several tries, the pump finally turned off & I opened the drain & moved on.  In the midst of our shower, which was adjacent to the tub, the pump suddenly turned itself back on &, because the water now level with the jets, the jets began shooting COPIOUS amounts of water onto the shower stall wall, the window, the opposite wall, the bathroom floor, our PHONES (which were on the shelf next to the tub & which we retrieved & slung out of the room before diving back into the tub, wrestling the nozzles to a downward position, & scrambling to try to turn off the pump).  After several failed attempts to turn the pump off, it finally went silent & the flooding stopped. There we stood in an inch of water, totally shell-shocked, half laughing, but still seriously worried about our phones, when the tub turned itself back on a THIRD time - thankfully the water was all drained out or distributed into the room at this point, so no further soaking occurred, but now the pump wouldn't turn off. We ended up calling the front desk for a third time (we had managed to place one call after each malfunction) to let them know that now they were in danger of having the pump burn out in addition to the flooding, & shortly thereafter maintenance arrived to break the circuit.  Housekeeping was right on the heels of maintenance & quickly cleaned up the mess, & the front desk said they were sending security to file a report in case our phones were damaged.  Our morning was wasted & we were hungry & wanted breakfast, so when security didn't show after housekeeping finished, we sought them out on our way to what was now lunch.  We were perplexed that we had not seen a manager yet, given the severity of the problem & the fact that it hamstrung our entire morning.  We had to be very proactive in getting a manager's attention, but the manager's representative did contact us by phone that afternoon.  She acknowledged the problem & very fairly compensated us for having to deal with such a messy morning, & we were totally satisfied with how the situation was ultimately handled.  Thankfully, our phones seem none the worse for wear so far, as we had excellent case coverage in place on both devices.

Overall, our stay was super pleasant, the room was lovely, the location was optimal, we never missed the smoky presence of an on-site casino, & we would DEFINITELY choose to stay here again in the future!",3,0,0

My girlfriend and I stayed at the Trump for two weekend nights in June of 2014. We got a pretty good deal through the Priceline name your price feature but on that same token you don't know what hotel you're going to get when you do that, so when we got the Trump I was unsure what to expect. I did my research and saw the same complaints: far from the strip, no casino and bad parking situation. After my stay, I was again reminded how unreasonable certain people can be when writing reviews on Yelp, because our stay was truly fantastic. I can say without a doubt that the Trump is the nicest hotel I've EVER stayed at -- and I've stayed at the Venetian.

From the moment we walked in, we were treated like royalty. Lots of being addressed as ""sir"" and lots of smiles. We went to the pool on our first day (the pool was nice -- nothing extravagant like Caesar's Palace or the Venetian) and one of the pool employees asked us if we want to sit in the sun or shade and then set up the chairs with our towels tucked in and even gave us advice to show up early the following day, Saturday, because of how busy it can get. On our last night, I got back from Treasure Island, where I went to play poker, at about 2 a.m. I went to the front desk to ask about the late checkout situation since I knew I'd want to sleep in and the desk employee said ""the latest I can do without charge is 2 p.m."" Wow! Good luck getting that late of checkout for free at any other high-end Vegas hotel. I also asked if I could get another comforter and one was sent up to my room within 10 minutes. It goes without saying the room was amazing -- the bed was super comfortable, the bathroom was amazing in itself (huge shower and bath tub, TV in the mirror) and the kitchenette was cool, though we never really used it, except for the coffee maker (free Starbucks coffee was a very nice touch).

As for the complaints:
1.) ""It's far from everything"" Then you know what? If you're looking to roam the strip for hours at a time on a nightly basis then this place probably isn't for you. My girlfriend and I liked the fact it was off-strip because we're over the strip craziness and it made for a relaxing and quiet stay, while the strip was still close enough for us to easily meet up with our friends staying at Caesar's Palace. On that note, the free shuttle to\/from Caesar's was nice (we never used the one to the Wynn), and it runs every 10 minutes or so. The one time we used it it was returning from Caesar's (we decided to take a cab there -- about $10 with tip) and we didn't have to wait for the shuttle to get there and it was a quick ride.
2.) ""But there's no casino!"" You're in Vegas -- there are plenty of nearby casinos. Treasure Island was my nearby choice for my one night of gambling, and it was less than a 10-minute drive and under a mile away. I drove, but you could certainly walk or take a cab. Again, it's Vegas...your options are plenty! I personally liked walking in to a hotel that smelled nice and not having to walk through a smokey corridor with degenerate gamblers to get to my room, but maybe that's just me.
*Also, the loud freight train some people have complained about never bothered us, but then again we were on the 49th floor...we were also facing the tracks though, so if we were on a lower floor it might have been a problem, because we could definitely hear the horn at times, though it never woke us. Translation: get a higher room!

The only reason I'd ""downgrade"" it half a star is because of the valet only situation. Yes, I knew this after getting assigned the hotel in the Priceline match and, after doing my research, I made sure to have cash on hand at all times for tips. That means that if you plan on taking your car to go out frequently -- and you might have to, given the location -- then be prepared and bring cash. I consider myself a generous tipper and have no problem tipping, especially in a place like Vegas which is so service-oriented. However, having self parking would be a nice option seeing as how pricy doing valet a couple of times a day can be. It almost puts your guests and valet employees in a weird situation, because guests might not always be inclined to tip since they're being ""forced"" to valet and it's technically part of the resort fee, and in turn the valet employees -- whose livelihood is dependent on those well-deserved tips -- might get upset, and somewhat understandably so. At the end of the day, frequent tipping, even a couple of dollars each time, is MUCH cheaper than taking a cab to\/from strip locations. In the three times we picked up the car, I tipped $2, $3 and $4 and never did I feel like I got lesser service because my rental car wasn't fancy or the tip was comprised of singles.

In summary, I highly recommend the Trump, but do your research and make sure the particulars of the hotel work for you!",4,1,1

We were told it would take an extended period of time to fix the problem, so they were going to upgrade us into a 2 bedroom suite for free.  Awesome.  We ended up in a large two bedroom suite on the 61st floor with a view right down the Strip. You ever seen Rain Man? The big high roller suite? It kinda felt like that.

The suites are nice and clean.  Full kitchen.  Bathrooms are luxurious. They even had a bidet. Damn fancy.

The room service was decent.  Did not try out the lobby bar.  They have a shuttle that will run you over to the Wynn or Caesar's.  Runs every 15 minutes til about 2am.  The pool is actually pretty small for a hotel with their capacity.

As long as I have a room to go to at the end of the night, I am good. But let me tell ya, this hotel blew me away! Recently our group of friends decided to make a trip to Vegas. I let my friends handled the hotel. Several of us ended up booking rooms at the Trump. One of our friends upgraded theirs to a penthouse suite so I got to check out both the regular room, which I stayed in, and the penthouse suite. The rooms are a steal for the price!

Let's start with the pros: complimentary water, the stove, microwave, non-smoking, fridge, sink, his and her closet, his and her sink, tub + spacious shower. I like the small detail of the tv screen in the bathroom so you can watch while you're brushing your teeth. All rooms here are suite style so it's fairly spacious even if you didn't book a penthouse suite. There is a pulled out couch that allows you to fit a few extra people in your room. No casino which can be either a pro or a con. For me, it's a pro. I do not miss the smell of cigarettes. The penthouse suite was large, beautiful, and had a gorgeous few on the 63rd floor. It's perfect for a large party.

One night, we decided to order room service. Our chicken noodle soups was sooo salty. They were more than happy to take it back and fix it for us. Their service is impeccable.

The con? NOTHING! I would definitely stay here again in a heartbeat.",6,4,1

Also, the costumer service was exceptional. There was no wait when I checked in. The front desk person pointed out the extra costs we should expect on our bill, the amenities, and even walked us to the elevator.

Echoing the negatives: Trump Tower is a fifteen-minute walk away from the strip. It was annoying at night, but during the day when the Fashion show mall was open it wasn't that bad (Monday - Saturday from 9am - 10pm and Sunday from 11am to 7pm). The Nordstrom's entrance is directly across from the hotel's lobby, providing a decent short cut.

Continuing on negatives, I'm surprised I didn't read more about the following:

The Internet connection was hit or miss - sometimes it worked, but more often it didn't, especially on my phone.

Cell phone reception was poor. This isn't necessarily the hotel's fault, but if you have AT&T and want to depend on your phone you may want to seek other accommodations.

The 'extra' bathroom door was weird. Once inside the bathroom, there was a second, frosted-glass enclosure for the toilet. It was confusing - Is it for people who are comfortable sharing the bathroom and hearing but not quite seeing everything? The glass door would loudly slam shut too if you didn't pay attention to it. 

Finally, the TV was small, less than 30 inches. A minor issue, I suppose, but is this expected from a five star hotel?

These negatives, especially the poor Internet access, led to my three star review. Since there are so many high-quality hotel options on the strip, I'll seek another during my next Vegas trip.

EDIT: When I checked out, I mentioned the internet issues and the staff comped the $20 a day charge. Smooth move. Maybe I'm fickle, but surprise savings are my weakness. I've upped my three stars to four.",2,1,1
