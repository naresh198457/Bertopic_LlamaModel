I am not a big time gambler.   I love to play, but I only play $5 or $10 tables as I hate losing money.   I can play for a long time even if I am losing and not go broke.   That is why I was excited to hear NY NY was adding $5 tables blackjack.  It worked, it got me to gamble there for the first time.

You usually have to wait for a seat to open up, but it usually only takes a few minutes.  No issues with that.

I have only one issue.   It is the dealers.  They completely lack personality.  I have tried on multiple occasions and it does not matter who you get.   They rarely speak at all.  They just deal like robots.

I have given up trying.  I will be going elsewhere for my gaming needs.",0,0,1

He said he wanted to stay in a fun hotel on the strip. After doing some research, I picked this place for us. So as his best man, I had to make sure he had a good time.

We stayed in the players suite. Came with a jacuzzi. Nice layout for the room and plenty of space. The service here was very good and prompt. Made sure we always had fresh towels. 

I indulged in sports betting at the sports book. It was so cool and thrilling to set up some bets, watch the games there, and wait on the results. I ended up winning too! Plenty of tv screens and they have all the games on. The casino itself is big. Lots of slots and tables to play on. Then there many different food choices there to eat. Steak, brunch, pizza, hot dogs, crepes, etc. 

It's in a good location on the strip, so you can walk in any direction to go do some other things, and you're not too far from the hotel. I would definitely stay here again. My friends enjoyed it as well, so we'll probably be back soon.",1,0,1

There's now the daily resort fee, which at least includes two free drinks.  The rooms are small, but the beds are comfy and we loved the extra pillows.  There's plenty going on within the hotel, with lots of dining choices and bars.  Zumanity is here too, which is a great show.  My husband is also part of the Player's Club, and although he by no means spends a large amount of money gambling we got a great room rate offer.

I wished it lived up to expectations.  We stayed in early July '15.  Not what I would consider the best value for the money on the strip.

Unfortunately, we stayed for two nights and had issues both nights with the room that prevented a sound sleep.  The first night our smoke detector started beeping (due to low battery) around 4:50am in the morning; maintenance promptly came up and fixed it after a call to the front desk.  The second night, our a\/c unit started making a squeaking sound around 5am, but we were too tired to get dressed to have maintenance come for an indeterminate amount of time to to fix it and there was no way we felt like packing up and switching rooms.

We did mention these issues upon checkout and after some insistance, we were compensated what we asked for, so I feel customer service was good.  However, for the price we were charged per night, I feel these things should not have happened.

Oh, and we had splurged for the 'strip view', but what we got was a view of the airport and the Excalibur, and Mandalay Bay, which are at the far end of the strip.  Not worth requesting a strip view, IMO.  Also, because it's so far down on the strip, it's not convenient to everything.

BUT...it IS convenient if the UFC is at the MGM Grand and\/or the Mandalay Bay,  We stayed here for UFC 189.",1,1,2

But, it seemed like the wait at the elevators (Century Tower) was longer than it needed to be.  There are only 4 elevators that service the very frustrating, you were already annoyed when you came downstairs in the morning because of the wait.

The VIP check in area is very nice, and the women were fantastic.  Very quick process.  Same with the valet.  The room left a little to be desired.  We required a fridge due to some medical supplies, and when it was delivered the guy delivering it commented on how small our room was.  He had to put it by the door because it fit no where else in the room.  This meant it was bumped a couple of times on our way in\/out of the room.

When we arrived the safe did not work.  This caused us to have to wait in the room about 20 minutes for security to come.  The woman with security was very nice and solved the problem quickly, but it was an annoyance to deal with right when we arrived.  Also, the safe was on the floor of the room.  In other MGM properties I have stayed at (Bellagio, MGM Grand), the safe is inside the night table next to the beds, so you can sit on the bed and get into the safe.  At NYNY, I had to sit on the floor and lean over, which was also annoying.

MLife employees were friendly.  There are lots of casual dining options in addition to a very good steakhouse in Gallagher's.  I think if the rooms were upgraded upstairs, it would help a lot.  Good location, with a quick walkway to MGM Grand and a very short walk to Monte Carlo.  They do need to remedy the elevator situation.",4,4,4

Not only was the hotel staff courteous and helpful, they went out of their way to make our stay as pleasant as possible. From the moment we walked through the doors, it felt like we had flown from Arizona to the Wonderful Land of Oz. 

From the Bar at Time's Square and the sizeable gaming floor, to the many restaurants, it was a virtual playground for the young and young at heart. Everywhere you turned, the atmosphere was filled with electricity.

We stayed in the Park Avenue room and I must admit, I had never slept as comfortable in a hotel as I did there. The ONLY downfall was the night the B-52's held a private concert outside below our 33rd floor room. Loud doesn't begin to describe the vibe as we were trying to rest. But then again...it is Las Vegas, right? You don't go there to rest (much). 

I would highly recommend to anyone a stay in New York New York. Generally speaking, you won't regret it - that is unless you are of the mindset that this is a place to tuck yourself away for a few nights. For that, I suggest the Comfort Inn Suites somewhere far removed from the strip location.",0,0,0

My BIGGEST draw with this place is the walk from the tower elevators to my room. This could have been better planned out, for sure. It seems like there is only a set of elevators at the center of the building, meaning if you have a room at the END of  the building, the walk to your room can be slightly ridiculous.

The roller coaster is overpriced and the food court area inside is ok but nothing special. What makes NYNY awesome is the outside Brooklyn Bridge area on Las Vegas Blvd. The addition of restaurants like Shake Shack burger and Tom's Urban are nice. The bridge also has good entertainment and live music at night. The casino definitely benefits from the new T-Mobile Arena which is located in between the casino and Monte Carlo.,2,0,0

We came and had initially reserved and paid for a two queen room. When we checked in they had said there was only a room with 1 king bed. The person at the desk assured us that they would send up a rollaway bed to accommodate our party of four. However, when we called room service to verify that the bed was coming they told us that they did not have any left. How is a group of four adults supposed to be sleeping on 1 king bed? You tell me.. but being it the holidays I tried to be positive and called housekeeping for blankets and sheets to be sent up only to be told that they didnt have anymore blankets left but could send up bed sheets & pillows. I agreed and I asked for it to be delivered and dropped off to the room because i had other arrangements that kept me from staying in the room. I went out and came back tired to find out my keys werent working. I went down to the front desk only to wait 45 minutes with 1 person working at front desk. When it was finally my turn, I had someone completely rude. At this point, Im already tired and had enough so Im excited to go back to the room and just call it a night. When I do get into my room, I only find two extra pillows and no bed sheets..... now Im sitting on the couch waiting for these darn bed sheets to get here. On top of everything, I find hair on the bed.. and let me tell you.. it isnt ours........... Probably wont be coming back to this hotel..

Regardless of holiday or not. I would assume they could at least be considerate when taking care of you and actually carry through the requests that they had agreed upon.

EDIT: We called room service again to ask for the sheets that were not brought to us. A woman returned with sheets and was kind enough to offer to look again for a rollaway bed. It is now 3am and she was able to bring back a bed which we had the mattress separated from the frame of the bed to create two makeshift mattesses. Because of this arrangement there is no floor space. The one star is for the woman who kindly came to our rescue.",0,0,0

You are in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip. Not too far from the McCarran airport. If you don't feel like walking along the strip then head across the street to MGM Grand to take the monorail. 

The hotel was very affordable and had good rates. We got a 2 queen size bed rooms. The rooms were nice, clean, and it was a big room. Our room had a view of the T-Mobile Arena and parts of the Roller Coaster. 

Plenty of casino games to go gamble and play. They are spread all over. If you don't feel like gambling, but still want to have fun. You can definitely check out the gaming arcade they have. They also have a roller coaster. 

There are plenty of restaurants to go eat without every leaving the complex. They are trying to make New York City-ish, but I don't really think it is in terms of the food. 

If you are looking for shopping, then there are gift stores inside the casino like the Hershey's World Store.

Work sent me here to join a last minute conference. The conference was at NY NY and though there could be worse places to hold a conference, I was hoping to stay at a place with some good restaurants. 

NY NY has always been a mediocre type hotel for me. Im not a snob... just saying.. Vegas has seriously revamped within the last 5 years! Not the worst as it is somewhat still in the middle of things with City Centre being the next block over. But not exactly the best either as I'd still have to walk quite a bit to get over to the heart of things. 

It's definitely not one of those hotels you travel to for the food and since this was a work thing rather than a social outing, I wanted the FOOD that Vegas is oh so good for. Unfortunately, NY NY wasn't it. BUT the hotel stay itself wasn't so bad. The room is spacious and decent. Clean and NOT smelly like some other hotels. They've got a good variety of machines and tables. AND they had a sports book which is muy importante during football season for me. :)

We booked our room months in advance and requested early check in, which you pay extra for. When we arrived at the hotel our room was not ready and they told us then that early check in is just a request and it is not guaranteed available- even though we paid for it... It was such a hassle to deal with the front desk and finally after much back and forth the girl who was helping us got a manager who (kind of) took care of us and got us in a room.... Not the room we requested .. It was on the back side of the hotel.... But none the less we got a room. That did not start our trip off on the right foot, but we rolled with it. 

When we finally got to our room, I heard a loud constant noise.... They put us in a room that was next to some kind of generator (?).... Electrical (?).... There was something in there and the entire trip we had to deal with that constant high pitched running noise... 

We ventured out to check the place out.... Originally from NY, I was super excited to stay here.... But I quickly realized that there was nothing to be excited about. Customer service at each and every shop\/restaurant, etc was HORRIBLE!!! 

Let's start with Greenwich coffee.... We went to get a coffee and I asked the rude girl for a mocha. She asked me what size, and I asked her what sizes do you have? She said small or large.... I asked 'well what size is your small and what size is your large?'.. Her response with eyes and mouth wide open with a head bob was 'we have small.... And we have large...'.... Umm that's okay and I put up my hand and said 'actually, I'm good'... She walked away without a second thought.... FYI little girl, when I asked what the sizes were I was hoping for the ounces, so I know how much I would be taking in. Never gave that place a second thought.

Went to the other coffee place 'Il Fornaio' and they were much better.. The girls were nice and the coffee was good. They get really busy and they handle it OK. I was a little frustrated one of the mornings when I went and ordered 2 small vanilla lattes, one regular and one decaf.... When I got them I tasted mine and realized there was no vanilla. Being really busy I went to the barista and asked if there was vanilla and she said no they were regular, I asked her to add it and went to the register to let the girl know, my exact words were 'I don't think the girl heard me ask for vanilla so the barista is fixing my drink but can I pay for the difference?' She said not to worry about it but 'next time make sure to ask for it'... I was only fairly annoyed with this because it was obvious they were busy but that's the exact time you need to hone in and listen to your customers orders, it was clear to me that neither of the register girls listened to me.. They were overwhelmed, but they were polite and accommodating. 

Nine fine Irishmen... Went in there and waited about 20 minutes for our server.... Ended up getting up and going to the bar instead.... Bartender was cool, not the best bartender but he was nice. Food was AMAZING... We went back here a few times this trip for the clams... 

Did not know they had a 24 hour shop in the hotel. This would've been nice if someone had told us at check in... It was unfortunate we toughed out midnight heartburn after drinking so much and didn't see this shop until the day we left. Really front desk people--- would have been nice to know that was there!! 

Okay let's talk about the casino... Craps dealers were talking about their weekend the whole time and missed paying us out at least 3 times during our game. That was really not cool... Don't waste your money at this casino... If you like the ambiance of Vegas and to people watch, go somewhere that's busier and more professional. The casino was empty by midnight... Was not worth it. 

Went to il fornaio restaurant for breakfast one morning and server dropped us some water and disappeared.... So long we ended up leaving and going off site for food. Luckily we tried this place again and sat at the bar and had really good service and the food was really really good.... 

All in all, the food here is good.... But the service sucks. Definitely better places in Vegas to spend your money.",0,0,0

We stayed in a Broadway room. You have to be careful when you book that you are not put in a room with pink windows. I was warned of this before we booked because apparently your whole room is pink all the time. 

The room was pretty spacious. Unfortunately it did have a big column in the room that blocked part of our view. You do get two big windows though. 

I know you don't go Vegas to watch t.v. but when it's late and you just want to fall asleep to it you want it to work. It's a small junky old t.v. Keep your little kids away from it because it's really loose on the little swivel thing that holds it. The remote had a mind of it's own. It didn't matter what you pressed on the remote it just went all over the place. Plus you had to use your muscles to even get it to work at all. Then, of course 50% of the channels rolled so your couldn't even see a picture. 

So I thought, heck with the t.v. let's listen to the ipod on the ipod dock. Nope. Volume didn't work. Finally, after ten minutes of poking at it with a pen I got the volume to work a little. 

When you stay at this hotel remember to bring your Draino. The bathroom sink drains slooooww. While washing my face I looked down and almost the whole sink was filled. 

I liked the shower though. There was a light in there for good leg shaves and it had plenty of shelves for all of our girly things. 

The room itself was pretty clean although I think they need to clean out the dusty vents. Lots of sneezing going on.

Pool area was B-O-R-I-N-G. It was pretty small and the sun didn't hit it until about 12:30 or 1:00. So if you go out early to get a seat then prepare not to get any sun until then. Though that might be a good thing. We sort of enjoyed not being scorched. But if that is your goal then don't rush out there. Poolside seats are limited but people get so bored they leave so you could get a poolside seat if you wait it out a bit. 

So if you come to Vegas on the cheap this hotel isn't too bad. Just warning you of all the little pitfalls.",2,0,2

I love love love New York New York.
The decor inside and out of this casino and the roller coaster make this a must see spot in Vegas. 
The casino here is one of my favorites. The ceilings are high making it much less smokey than others on the strip. There are a ton of themed slots and tables to play at. 
This is MLife property and if you are a part of their rewards system, where you can receive a free or BOGO to the New York, New York Roller Coaster. The Roller Coaster brings me back to my teenage years and with the car made to look like a taxi cab, it is just too fun!
When you are headed to the roller coaster, there is an arcade that is perfect for kids(and skillfully located). Bringing kids to Vegas may be challenging, but this is a great stop for the little guys. Arcade games and a roller coaster can make a great day or evening. 
Make sure to check out the Hershey shop that is located here. 
I would love to see how the hotel rooms are decorated. Hopefully we can grab a room here when we come back to Vegas!",1,0,1

The hotel was decent. It is walking distance to the Bellagio\/Caesar's area, but it's a pretty lengthy walk - about 2km according to Google Maps but felt much longer with all the stairs\/walkways. 

We were given the additional rollaway bed we asked for within 30 minutes of entering the room. Requests for additional towels and slippers were also completed in a timely manner. 

My main issue is that we had booked through expedia.com where the room was listed ast having 2 queen beds, but we actually received 2 double beds.

What I enjoyed the most was the fact that I don't have to walk so much in order to get to places. I was an elevator ride down from the food court, parking and arcade. Everything has such an easy access! My last stay was at MGM Grand which was a great casino as well but it doesn't compare with the amount of traffic of people you have to deal with like in NYNY.

THE GOOD:

Great location if you are driving from the airport.  Easy off and on from the freeway!  Close to MGM, Monte Carlo, Excalibur and Luxor, plus you can catch the tram across the street.  The Canyon store across the street also has a big selection of alcohol and lots of nic nacs you might need that you forgot at home.  Close to Ross Store too if you need clothes while you are there!  Easy walk to Bellagio for the light show and the many other hotels and shopping down the strip.

We got upgraded from the Park room to the Madison room which was roomier and very nice.  They were out of Strip views but we got a great room on the 28\/29 floors with a great view anyway.

The matresses were very comfortable!

Free newspaper each day at the little store near the exit to the parking garage.

All the staff I dealt with was very friendly.  I never came across anybody with attitude or rudeness.

Free wi-fi included with the resort fee (see resort fee under THE BAD).

Check-in as quick on a Wednesday night but each time I passed by the line was always much shorter than what I have experienced at Excalibur and MGM.

THE BAD:

Our room the first night was next to some up-all-night party goers... it was so noisy and the hub did not sleep very well.  We asked for a new room the next night and the people next to us were not as noisy but they were still loud and noisy, just not up all night!  The walls are too thin if you get the adjoining rooms.  As for rooms that don't adjoin and that might be better.

There is a $20 resort fee (typical I think of all the hotels on the strip) per night so even if you have comped room you still pay the resort fee.  They did tell me at the check-in that if you play enough, you can use your comps to offset the resort fee.

We asked for a cork screw and wine glasses and there was a $5 fee for each plus a delivery fee added on from room service!!!!  OUCH!

I did not win any money on the slot machines but it was fun and they did let me play for a while...

Overall a good visit and I might return if I find another good deal!",6,2,4

They gave us a room in the Empire Tower which was close to the front desk, pool entrance and gift\/snack shop which worked out well. We also asked for a room close to the elevator and the lady that helped us booked us the 1st one you see out of the elevator... Very nice of her. Our room was decent sized and because it was a corner room, it allowed for us to get a roll-away bed to accommodate other people while leaving a good amount of room to still to navigate the space.

The pool area was decent. Not very big, so you gotta stake your claim on a lounge chair quite early or just wait around for some people to leave. But it was a good time spent cause there's no too many people like other Vegas hotel pools... The roller coaster screams overhead from time to time but you'll get used to it. Good times...

What I like about NYNY was that it had a lot of places to choose from as far as dining options go. Whether casual dining or something a little more special. I tried a fish & chips place that was pretty good except the wait was waay too long. They seemed understaffed so I tried to understand but as hungry as I was and I was buying food for my friends as well, the wait time (over 30 mins) was unacceptable. There's also a decent italian joint that has pizza\/pasta dishes with waiter service.

Valet was quick to get your car... Even as busy as they were. And you know how important this is during the Summer in Vegas. Proximity to the freeway on-ramp is a plus for NYNY. Whether you're headed back to McCarran Int'l airport or to Downtown LV, the freeway is a quick right turn after you leave the valet pick-up.

Choppy and sporadic internet connection. Not bad if you surf, but terrible for streaming live radio and slow for all other uses. Internet is charged in the Resort Fee. RF is about $21. per night so this is not free or comped, though many guests never use it. I record radio shows and had problems with this connection. The connection was strong, so that was not the problem. 

Bathtub was slow to drain. My wife had to wait more than five minutes for the water to drain after my shower.

Long walk to our room, on the floor. Because of the building layout, there is a long walk to some rooms from the elevators. 

Every day, the drapes were opened by the cleaning staff. The first day. it was 106 degrees outside and pretty hot in the room because of all the heat conduction that came through the exposed (closed) window. After that, I made a point of closing the curtains and the room stayed cool. 

Now the good points.

Great elevator service. Six elevators that moved rapidly. Short waits and rarely crowded. 

Great hotel location. Especially for RTC local bus service, many routes on the cross street (Tropicana) and no transfer to the airport (Route WAX without a transfer). Also WAX going west on Tropicana was a quick ride to downtown Fremont Street along I-15.Runs about every twenty minutes, with times posted and kept to its schedule, while I was using the route.   

Fabulous Times Square Bar with two piano players. Great party every night. Be sure to request Piano Man, it fits this bar perfectly. 

Also, across Tropicana Ave. is a free monorail that stops at the three casinos south of Tropicana. Mandalay Bay has one of my favorite buffets. (Careful it is not cheap).",3,0,0

They charged me for the first night which is standard procedure. I contacted New York New York directly so that they could take the remaining balance. I wanted everything paid up front before my arrival. I was told that I needed to fill out a Authorization form that was emailed to me so that the remaining balance would be charged to my card. I filled out the form and faxed it back the same day. I was told everything was paid in full and was told about offers that I would receive as a guest like 2 for 1 show tickets for Zumanity. Nothing was ever said to me about any additional charges.
Upon arrival 10\/10\/2014 I showed my I.D., Debit Card and gave the receptionist my confirmation number. I was told that I had to pay $50.00 a night for a deposit. I had spoke directly to New York New York's staff and not Bookit.com prior and it was never disclosed to me about any deposit prior to my arrival. I was also told that because I paid for the room with my Debit card the deposit was more. If this was disclosed to me I would have paid for the room with my credit card. I paid cash for the deposit which I was not to happy about and while speaking to the Supervisor he offered to compensate me by reversing the travel fees of $67 to my account upon departure. My guest that accompanied me spoke to the Supervisor as well and he offered to upgrade us from our Spa Suite to the Marquis Suite on our final night.
On Sunday we left our room around 10:40 AM to attend a Vow Renewal Ceremony at the Bellagio. Upon returning, we noticed that our bed had been made, new towels had been replaced but there were dirty drinking glasses and a empty Pepsi can on the end tables. In addition to that the trash had not been emptied and the safe had been opened. Luckily before leaving we emptied the safe where we had a large amount of cash inside. We called the front desk to transfer us to our supposed, ""Upgrade"". Upon entering our room we noticed immediately that the Spa Tub which the front desk told us would be a Whirlpool Tub and bigger was the same exact size in our previous Suite. The room was outdated in comparison to our Spa Suite and we realized that we were put in a handicap room. There were rails in the restroom, shower and a removal seat. I had to take a shower in my house shoes because I did not feel comfortable taking a shower with my bare feet on the shower floor nor did we utilize the Spa Tub. I feel like the upgrade was not an upgrade and the previous room that we were in was much better. I also felt disrespected by being told that that we were going to receive an upgrade due to the unexpected fees upon our arrival and placed in a handicap room. Later on that night I called the front desk to ask for a late checkout for 1:00 PM and the guy at the front desk kept telling me the latest time I could check out would be 12:00 PM. After going back and forth about three times he finally said it would be okay to check out at 1. When I arrived home and looked at my e-mail there was a self checkout email that stated the latest checkout was at 1 PM. We left our room again because we had dinner reservations at Hugo's Cellar. When we returned we bought drinks and gambled. I went to the front desk and spoke to the front desk clerk about not being happy about our accommodations and experience at this property. He went in the back and said he would speak to the Supervisor. I had asked him if we could speak to the Supervisor ourselves initially. When he returned he acted as if he was looking in the computer for something and handed me a $35.00 food voucher that was good for certain eateries on the property. He also stated this this voucher could only be used prior to checkout. This would have not worked for us because we had asked for a late checkout earlier because we knew we were going to be up pretty early in the morning hours gambling. The eateries would not be open during this time. I declined the voucher. I did not feel like I was treated properly for the amount of money that I paid to stay at the facilities. I felt like the money that I spent did not matter to the Supervisors and front desk workers . Money was spent on the our Suite (1,110) in addition to room service, gambling, drinking, and tipping bartenders, valet and bells man. A lot of money was spent solely at New York New York and our treatment was horrible. I will never stay at this property again.

What we paid for groovy eats, bets, and shops of the hotel that we would have enjoyed staying elsewhere on the strip for a little less money.
 
I'm not being snobby. I've stayed at Disney resorts and I've stayed at Motel 6's.. and I've given them both high marks. The room at NYNY had nice decor, but it didn't appear that it had been well taken care of. It wasn't really dirty, but I did feel I had shelled out a lot of money for a so-so room. Double sinks shouldn't always double the price. If I return to Vegas, I do want to stay on the strip, but I may consider Tropicana or Excalibur. They are older, but I think they are a better value. If the sheets are clean, then I'm good. Both of those hotels are linked to NYNY by bridges anyway.
 
Good: NYNY does have the ""Village Eateries""-- one of the nicest hotel food courts on the strip. The great selection snakes through brick alleys and outdoors streets... very cool. Though I thought the room was average, I like the concept of the hotel having different towers (each one being a different New York city skyscraper). Our room was in the Chrysler Building. The sidewalk in front of the hotel really captures the essence of New York city... especially at night.
 
Bad: Roller coaster fan? Skip the coaster on roof of this hotel. If you have to do it just to say you did, as I did, then do it. It was a horrible, painful design that contributed to an instant headache. Though, I loved the look of the coaster, it must have been purely designed for the novelty of being on a rooftop and NOT designed as a pleasurable thrill-ride for human riders. The casino was attractive, but the New York city decor was a little weak in this area... a bit generic.

Overall, though, I have to say the modern glitz of places like the Bellagio and and the Venetian combined with a distinct unpretentious quirk made New York New York kind of the archetype of what a Vegas casino should be. When I landed at McCarran that morning, I definitely envisioned all the casinos feeling like this one.

The casino floor has that faux-outside design to it, meant to evoke being in some sort of 1960s version of Manhattan. It's kitschy, but it's fun.

The tables run the range from low limits for the casual player to much higher stakes, so there's a little something for everyone. The dealers I had were super nice if not extremely talkative. 

Plus, this is another one of those casinos that has the catwalk by the tables populated with scantily clad go-go dancers. I can't count how many times the dealer had to snap me back into reality because I was distracted by the sexy. Okay, it was once, but it happened to everyone at the table, women included. The dancers are a fun distraction from the fact you're being bled to death.

So over all, New York New York had just the right kind of atmosphere for me to really feel like I was getting the Las Vegas experience.  Even when I was staying at the Riviera, I thought it was worth the feet shattering, hour+ long walk to get there.  It's an excellent high energy, but casual kinda place, packed to the ceiling with the kind of fun its namesake wishes it had.",1,2,3

A great place and location if you plan to just hang around the southern part of the strip.

It's a step up from Luxor and two steps up from Excalibur and Circus Circus and a bit more. It might not be the most luxurious hotel, but it has its odd charm and their nice staff. I've experienced some of the worst customer service at Wynn, so that's telling you something. 

My review is going to answer some of the complaints below, just because I was annoyed...

This isn't a very big hotel and it doesn't have a very big casino. So, if you get lost... urmm.. good luck? Let's say you come off of the NY Tower, to exit, you can either walk straight and turn left at the round bar and follow the path to the escalator (go up), and you'll be given two choices-go right and you'll end up at Excalibur and go straight and you're at MGM. If you didn't want to go there, follow the path by Il Fornaio, and in front of the front desk is a path leading to the taxi area or walk passed the front desk towards the bell desk and you'll end up at Valet. That simple! If not, the other exits include the one by the Sports Center (goes out to the bridge), Nine Fine Irishmen, and another one by the parking garage-ish (never use that one, it's weird).

As for security, although there aren't many in uniform, you can count on the retailers and shoe-shiner and other employees there. There was once a shooting upstairs by the NY Pretzel stand and the first person to take the shooter down was an employee at the gifts shop. So don't underestimate the security, also notice the numerous cameras by the NY Tower elevators, it's there for reason.

Yes, the hotel is a bit ""outdated,"" built in 1997 (when I was in the 2nd grade lol). But it's not as old as Tropicana, Excalibur, Luxor, or MGM.  There's a complaint about pillows, which I thought was weird. Anyway, if there isn't enough of something, you can always ask...it's not difficult to call Housekeeping and ask for more pillows, the standard for most Vegas rooms is 2 plus the one or two extra in the closet. 

For first time Vegas goers and New York State residents, you can't really take NYNY Las Vegas seriously for the real thing.  It's a themed hotel, and they'll try to mimic as best as they could, it's not going to be a perfect replication.  It's like taking Excalibur and Luxor as the real thing, which would be absurd.   And before you stay at the NYNY Hotel, why don't you just check where it is on the map, how stupid of you to complain about the walking distance to another hotel, it's not like the hotel can move and be closer to your destination. STUPID.... 

Now to answer the big topic of the day, resort fees. All of the Vegas hotels have resort fees, so suck it up and pay it. The Harrah's Entertainment Group (Paris, Rio, Harrah's, Bally's, etc) say they don't have resort fees but you still have to pay for your internet and all those small items (we all know someone brought a laptop to Vegas). NYNY has one of the smallest resort fees, incomparison to the Wynn, Aria, and Vdara at $20+.  The wireless was fast each time I used it, so to those who had connection problems, I have no idea what you did (I used the internet to check-in for my flight to Southwest, A group all the way).

To end my ""review,"" let's talk about food.  Check out casual dining at Greenberg's Deli in the Village, awesome sandwiches for your tummy and chicken noodle soup, there's also Nathan's Hot Dogs in the Arcade and 2nd floor Promenade.  Also don't forget the sit-down restaurant Il Fornaio and how can I forget Gallagher's, the only casual steakhouse on the strip (lamb chops bomb.com).  Room service, try their Ribeye Special from 3pm-10pm for $14.95 and their dinner entre Cedar Plank Salmon with extra onion strings for $17.95. 

That is all for now, I can say so much more, but so little space. =]",7,5,6

First off the tables seemed filthy and dirty with stains all over like they don't know how to take care of their tables.  My boyfriend accidentally spilled his beer on the table and the dealer looked at him with a disgusted look and rolled her eyes at him and off top that was the first negative thing I noticed.  He continued to play at the same table and was standing at the corner of the edge of the table where its hard to reach all the numbers on the other side.  Usually when he can't reach all the numbers he gives his chips to the dealer and tells her which numbers he wants his chips placed (which is NEVER EVER a problem at any other casino but here) and after a couple of times she seemed very snobby and gave him attitude about it.  She actually told my boyfriend to move closer to the middle so that she wouldn't have to place any of his chips for him because it was so hard for her to do! I guess it was so difficult for her to do because that means she would have to pay attention to what's going on with the game.  After she told my boyfriend to move with such harsh attitude that's when we decided to leave! Worse customer service ever!!!!!!! Who the hell hires these people?!

Now, I don't think it is fair to compare this hotel to places like the Venetian and the Bellagio which are 4 times the price. Compared to other hotels in their caliber, like the Luxor, NYNY is a great hotel. We payed $55on Wed\/Thur for their summer escape package. We only had the baseline skyline room (who stays in their room?). It was very clean and nicely decorated. My BF, who has a bad back, loved the beds since they were on the firmer side. I also thought they were comfy.  We were up on the 10th floor, so there was a semi view of the strip.  We were close to the rollercoaster, but it shut down late at night and you hear stuff all night long in Vegas anyway. The staff was very nice and friendly and the casino is nice. I loved the location - you are right across from the MGM and can easily walk to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay. 

The downside is that the food is pretty blah - the Il Fornaio is worse than other locations I have tried. The chin-chin cafe was sort of blah and the America restaurant is like any Denny's in America. The pluses in the food category were Nathan's and the Hagendaz stand. 

The casino is also very small so we really didn't gamble there. Also there are more children than in other locations - but that is better than the trashy elements in hotels like the Excalibur.

The decor here is just adorable. I've never been to NY, but whatever, I love it. 

We stayed across the street at the MGM, so we ended up spending quite a bit of time here since it's so close by, and I was having a love affair with the decor. I love all the little streets full of quick service food locations. The casino floor is pretty extensive. They have a Coyote Ugly Bar too, if you're into that sort of thing. 

They have a bar upstairs near Coyote Ugly though that serves good, strong drinks for a good price too. It's good for people watching. 

The decor here is awesome though. They definitely put a lot of time and effort into it. It's a fairly family friendly hotel too. Especially with the Roller Coaster. 

The Cirque du Soleil show here, Zumanity is awesome too. It's adult themed though, it's like a cross between Cirque du Soleil and Burlesque\/Cabaret. We loved it!",6,8,7

WTF?! Rude.

One added bonus for any iPhone users: iPhone charger dock right next to the bed which I LOVED! 

The only reason I'm not giving this hotel 5 stars is because when you have signs all around the hotel advertising $5 dollar blackjack tables all day and all night but then ONLY have two tables who are running that special then you probably shouldn't advertise that.

One of the restaurants there, Chin Chin was very good. The sushi, chicken lo mein, and breakfast buffet are amazingly good. There is a big arcade but my very tall 7 year old was too short to ride the roller coaster, which is one of the reasons we wanted to stay there. The pool lights up at night so my son enjoyed that. Unfortunately the internet did not work in our room which created a bunch of problems for us. We called tech support and they woke us up with a knock at the door 2 hours after calling the front desk only to tell us there was nothing they could do.  I hear that this resort will be building a central park themed amusement park soon. That seems like it would be really fun. We enjoyed the new Hershey World and cute NY theme throughout.

Bottom line: The NYNY hotel is affordable for the strip, is in a good location, and is within walking distance of a lot of fun attractions but next time I would choose a middle of the strip hotel like the Mirage or the Flamingo with kids. The hotel served its purpose and we would return.

Pros: Price is affordable, Free Parking, Chin Chin breakfast buffet (yum), cute theme

Great:
-The casino. Great slots, I won a lot of money here! Very friendly staff and waitresses. I don't drink but the waitresses were very nice and offered anything you could possibly want while gambling away. 
-The decor. Okay, so it's not an exact replica of New York. I've read a lot of complaints that it doesn't look authentic, but I'm originally from New York, and I think they did a good job. It's cute and a bit kitschy.
-The rooms. Awesome but a bit overpriced I think. I had a jacuzzi right in my room and it was quite spacious.
-The Mexican restaurant. I forget the name, but if you visit this hotel, DO NOT miss this food!
-Roller Coaster. Beautiful views, but expensive!
-Snack stand upstairs. Best caramel apple I've ever had. I went back about 5 times.

Not so great:
-America restaurant. Terrible service, terrible food. It's open 24 hours, but I'd rather take a cab or walk to another hotel if I'm hungry at 4am
-Game tables. There's more slot machines, and when I went, the people playing the tables seemed pretentious and unfriendly.
-Access to rooms. Confusing!

The whole hotel is themed like NY, ofcourse, and some parts of it even are made to resemble old new york streets. 

For breakfast, I recommend the America restaurant, which I believe is open all day. I mean, it was around 4am and I had a craving for country fried steak and eggs and people were inside, eating away. Awesome :)  But my favorite restaurant here has to be the Nine Fine Irishmen. They have great food and live irish music that starts at 9pm and it's a blast! 

Also, if you are going as a family, they have a wonderful arcade with plenty of games and entertainment! Since Gameworks closed, this place probably has the best arcade now and they still have the rollercoaster ride! (which i've never tried, lol)

Though I will say that in spite of that, they do have a same selections that you will find at most of the casinos in Vegas.

The not so good things. The tv remote did not have batteries so had to call maintenance. The tub drained very slowly and I had to remove the drain stopper.

I won't rate this hotel on the gaudy exterior or tacky interior since it's all par for Vegas. And I won't get into the general ambiance, but suffice to say it is, as you'd expect, a place for those with dying dreams. You will love NYNY if you like your air stuffy, smoke-filled, and heavy with the desperation of hundreds of strangers forcing themselves to have some approximation of so-called fun.

So none of that is why I'm giving one star to this supposedly classy Vegas mainstay. Rather, NYNY's main downfall is its housekeeping department. The front desk kicked things off by checking me into a room that was listed in their computer as cleaned, but had never actually been touched (unmade beds, trash can full of empty perfume bottles, etc). When I called down to ask to change rooms to one that'd been cleaned sometime within the last 72 hours, no one ever picked up the phone.

A trip downstairs on NYNY's hilariously overworked and insufficient elevators resulted in--to their credit--a modest room upgrade (a clean one at that). The next day I was gone from roughly 12-9pm, and despite no 'Do Not Disturb' sign, nobody came by. So at 9pm I asked that it be cleaned while we were at dinner. ""No problem, sir."" Would you be surprised to hear that 2.5 hours later it still hadn't been touched? At this point I called it a night and asked for the front desk to let me know what super secret code you need to whisper in order to get service. 

The next day, against all odds, housekeeping stopped by.

But the day after that, they were back to their usual ways: no one came at all the entire day. (Again despite no sign on the door and nobody being there all day.)

I won't even get into the quality of service once staff do actually clean: empty toiletries left scattered around, the unwanted hairs from previous guests \/ current staff, etc. You will also enjoy the pleasures of room service carts lining the hallways because nobody ever thinks to come pick them up. Never been in a hotel where you can pass somebody's room in the morning, see their food cart outside their door, and then see that same damn cart still there when you pass by again at night. 

All that to say: if you want to pay 2016 Vegas prices to experience something like a no-star hourly motel from 1990s New York City, then this past-its-prime 1c slot machine of a hotel is probably perfect for you. (Just make sure you check out by 11am or these price-gougers will assess yet another fee for the honor of a slightly later checkout.)

P.S. - none of this is actually meant to knock the housekeeping staff themselves. This kind of poor service is indicative of management's issues: not enough hiring, not enough training, not enough clear processes, not enough attention to detail. God help the poor staff who have to work in this kind of place for almost assuredly awful wages.",3,1,0

There's nothing about the city is small: big buildings, big monuments, big personalities, etcs.  So naturally I thought of the same of New York New York casino and hotel in Las Vegas.

I remember that I was in awe when NY NY first opened.  The casino did a pretty good job encompassing exterior decor that gave it the feel of New York City.  I appreciated the replicas of the Brooklyn Bridge, the Statue of Liberty, the skyline, and ferry boats.  That was years ago when I was just visiting the casino.

Recently I had the opportunity to stay there for a couple of nights.  The lobby itself was pretty spectacular with its' New York themes, decorations, and old photographs.  Strolling through its' food court gave me that New York feel.  Pretty cool so far.

The moment of truth was going into my room.  Unfortunately that was where the New York feel ended.  The room itself was not bad: comfy queen sized beds, alot of closet and drawer spaces, and an overall nice set up.  What really surprised me was the room was kind of plain and somewhat bland.  No splash of vibrant colors or anything.  The bathroom was quite small and also bland.  No only that but the amenities were very minimal: one small bottle of shampoo, one small bottle of conditioner, one small tube of lotion, and one small bar of soap.  Plus there's no in-room coffee maker to make yourself a cup of coffee or tea.  For a hotel\/casino in suchy close proximity of MGM, Excalibur, and Monte Carlo, one would think NY NY would be equally comparable.

The casino is not smoke-free but you can request a non-smoking room.  However the lingering smoke was everywhere even if you're on a non-smoking floor.

NY NY is affordable during the beginning of the week with the automatic $15\/day room fee tacked on.  Aside from room WiFi, the fee covers amenities that hardly anybody uses but I suspect they're added on at other big named casinos along the Strip.  The location of NY NY was ideal.  The parking situation was rather odd: you have to stop at the entrance for an employee to get a really good look at you (roll down window completely) before you can proceed.  I don't know what that person was looking for but none of the other casinos I've visited had that.  One of them was rather rude.

Overall NY NY was good but not spectacular.  Aside from the decor and NY theme, nothing about it really stood out.  I would prefer staying at other places.",1,0,0

I booked with NYNY because the location was primo and the price was not as ludicrous in comparison to the Wynn, Venetian, etc. for Memorial Day weekend. We arrived in Vegas at 3pm on Friday. We were afraid there would be a slew of people at check-in for the holidays. Luckily, there was no line, and the lovely desk lady quickly checked us in, upgraded us to a nicer room with a view for $15 extra, provided us info on things to do around the place, and gave us coupons for 2 complimentary drinks and shopping discounts around the NYNY hotel.

We went up to the rooms. OK. They aren't Wynn quality or anything like that. But the place was clean, spacious enough, and had all the basic amenities you need (AND free water! A must in Vegas!). It did not come with a mini fridge though, so forget about bringing back food. AND, I did notice the cable channels SUCKED. Very little channels. The NYNY commercials were cheesy and adult oriented. More class please! What if kids were flicking through the channels???

Anyhoo. Aside from that, we had free access to the pool and fitness center. I didn't swim in the pool, but it looked big and nice. I did go to the fitness center. It had everything you needed to get a good workout. Cardio machines, free weights, weight machines, mats, balls, etc. It also came with additional free amenities like bottled water, headphones, and the cardio machines came with your own TV. The views were nice because it overlooked the pool. I really enjoyed that part of the hotel. Additionally, for an extra $10, hotel guests can get get access to the spa amenities such as: jacuzzi, steam room, treats, etc.

--- ORIGINAL 6\/2\/2015 REVIEW ---
I've stayed here a few times now, most recently in late May 2015. It's centrally located on the strip. There are connecting walkways to the Excalibur, Luxor and Mandalay Bay.

The check-in process was fine, and the staff was friendly and accommodating.
The check-out process was simple. You can do it in a number of ways.. via the television, in-person, or via internet.

Wi-fi ""everywhere"" (in the hotel) and fitness center use are included in the resort fee ([resort fee amount deleted by user- see update]). I think I clocked about 5M download speed on the wi-fi. The resort fee also includes: local and 800 calls, boarding pass printing, notary, 2-for-1 roller coaster passes, faxing (five page limit) and daily newspaper.

Shower, faucet, and lavatory worked fine. Water pressure in the shower was great, and the shower head had a comfortable spray pattern.

[Parking pricing comment deleted by user - see update]. If you self-park in the right place, the exit from the parking structure is right next to the Century Tower elevators.

During the weekdays, craps has table limits as low as $10, with the typical 3\/4\/5x odds.",0,0,0

Meh.  As far as hotels on the strip go, you've seen one you've seen them all.  Literally and figuratively...at least for the most part.  I mean, you have outliers like The Wynn but places like that are exceptions to the mediocre rule.  I'm not sure what we paid for the room, but there were 4 guys sharing it.  So, in the end it came out relatively cheap.  And since we were in Vegas for a friend's bachelor party weekend extravaganza, lounging in the room would be kept to a minimum.  You know how it goes.

So, it was supposed to be a a non-smoking room, but when we walked in, it smelled like a wet ashtray.  But, I guess that's to be expected.  The room was a double and had two good sized queen beds with pretty comfortable mattresses.  Decor was run-of-the-mill Las Vegas blah and the bathroom was good sized and clean.  Nothing too spectacular, but it served it's purpose well: to sleep 4 inebriated and semi-coherent men comfortably.

The casino itself was like the room.  Again, nothing too spectacular.  And like every other casino, it served it's purpose well:  To get you drunk while you gamble away your money and make the worst decisions possible.  

And while we didn't see any of the hotel shows, word on the street is, Zumanity is Cirque du Soleil with tits.  So, if you're into that, then check it out.    If not, then you can ride the roller coaster or throw more money away at the diner called America....more on that shit hole later.

All in all, NYNY is, well, a hotel, on the Las Vegas strip.  Nothing more, nothing less.",2,2,2

Roller coasters, a bit of a crazy interior décor theme, a few large centrally located bathrooms and sprawling elevators. It's a pretty unique place in comparison to all the other hotels on the strip. The rooms are basic, and a little dated, but they are quiet and the pool is nice, but not spacious enough. The rates are good, but the towels suck and they often are out of many amenities, I think they are a bit under stocked as I've yet to get a fridge or humidifier even with advanced request. I'll give them one thing, their AC gets cold, just the way I like it. They have no real restaurants, but rather café's and shops, not soo much a shopping area, but just boutiques while you're on the way out. The beds are what you pay for, the sheets were clean, but thin and well used, not somewhere I'd visit again. ROK is ok, but is more of an updated club version of Coyote Ugly bar.

I think this casino is the most ""family"" friendly compared to other ones on the strip. The Arcade area by the Roller Coaster entrance was pretty impressive for kids all ages (including me). Too bad I'm such a chicken, I didn't ride the roller coaster. 

The casino is just like any other casinos in Las Vegas. I have to say, I love the gift shops merchandise. They have cool t-shirts compared to other casinos. Who doesn't love a t-shirt with New York New York writing on it? On top of that, the t-shirt has Ed Hardy feels to it...of course you will love to get one (now I'm being sarcastic).

When I checked in I asked for a good room and was not disappointed. The very nice check in clerk set me up with a corner room which provided views almost 180 degrees around. Awesome. 

After we checked in our bathroom sink was clogged and not working. We went back to the front desk to tell them and no less than 2 hours later it was unclogged and working. No big deal, and they fixed in quickly. 

I love the restaurants at NY NY and the casino area. There is easy access to other casinos with the bridges. 

The pool however is not so great, I have seen larger pools at airport hotels. Tip if you get a lower floor you might have to deal with the sound of the roller coaster, which I heard complaints about. So when you check in ask to be put away from the roller coasters. 

Another reason why NY NY didn't get 5 stars is that the elevators are slow and there are only two of them to get to some of the rooms. So had to wait sometimes up to 5 minutes just to get upstairs.

Well, New York New York Hotel has been the place until 2017 St. Patrick's weekend, March 16th-19th, for my reservations. It's not cheap, but it had been worth it for many, many years until now. 

First, I'd like to compliment two employees, they should get 5 stars. However, this review is for my experience with 1 employee from Housekeeping that ruined it ALL. The good: 
First, Gale from Customer Service for taking my request regarding my room reservations and answering questions regarding my stay. She's very kind, patient, and willing to help. Secondly, the Asian lady from housekeeping, who attempted to clean my room on Saturday, March 18th in New Yorker Towers. She was very diligent and accommodating when I only wanted to take my trash out of my room. She even tried to refuse the tip I gave her just because I happily declined  to have her cleaned my room. 

The BAD:
Now the reason why I only wanted to take my trash out on Saturday was because of my awful experience from housekeeping last Friday, March 17th.  I had left $23 tip on the table for MARIA M.-name tag (female, Hispanic, 5' 02 or 5' 03"", between the ages of 45-55 yrs old-yep, I remember details from any good\/bad encounter, especially bad) from housekeeping for cleaning my room later on that day. I was on my way out of my room between 9:45-11:00 am to go somewhere when I wanted to purchase a drink from the vending machine. I knew the vending machines accept $10, 5, even ones. The 3-one-dollar bills I had left for Maria with the $20 were kind of crumpled and couldn't use it in the vending machine. 

So I stepped out of my room, and saw the cleaning cart almost next door, could have been Room 2859, and said hello to see if anyone was in the room. Maria came out and I asked her if she had any change for $10. She said no at first, and then she said yes. She then asked me if I wanted my room cleaned while taking the $10 from my hand and reaching into her apron or one of the pockets. I replied yes to her question then she handed me 5 $1-dollar-bills back. I glanced back in her eyes with a puzzled look and said I can take 2 $5s or a $5 and 5-$1s. She then looked at me and said, ""I clean your room, $5 for me, and $5 for you.""  All I could do at that time was thanked her, kept my 5-$1s and went back in my room, sat down, tried to process what just happened and imagining what would she have done to my toothbrush if I didn't let her keep the $5. I took the $20 dollars back and left the $3 on the table. (Sorry, Maria. You could have had $23 tip, but you made me cringe in the most uncomfortable way). 

I've never experienced anything so forward in my life, especially having celebrated St. Patrick's in NY NY Hotel for the last 14 years, either with my friends, family, or boyfriend-thanks to RiRá the house band at Nine Fine Irishmen for playing such great music, who is an amazing group of collectively talented and truly kind at heart musicians. 

Now, St. Patrick's in 2018 might be a different story. I would definitely stay somewhere else just to avoid certain housekeepers or hustlers in New York New York Hotel. I don't want to ruin my yearly tradition by experiencing something unpleasant from this hotel. Undoubtedly, bar none, worst experience ever from housekeeping.

Pros: 

*Location location location. 
Close to MGM, Excalibur, Ceasars and a lot of other hotels on the strip. 
*Free parking garage (as most hotels on the strip) 
*Lots of restaurant choices to choose from.
 My favorite? Gallaghers for the steak. 
*Rooms are large and modern. Feels like its been recenty remodeled
*Starbucks opened at 05:30 in the morning wich is great for the jetlagged europeans 
like myself. 

Cons:

*While not an expensive hotel i think its a little to pricey for what you get. 
*The pool area. Small and with poolbar that fits it and theres not a lot of people there. 
It also gets shady pretty early in the afternoon. 

Conclusion? This is an ""ok"" hotel with fair pricing and lots of restaurants that has a good location on the strip. As the Excalibur is cheaper, has the same quality of rooms and a lot better pool area i would stay there instead. Yes the lobby\/casinopart of Excalibur feels really old and dated but as im not a gambler who spends a lot of time there, i dont care.

But to sleep in a room where is seems that there is someone smoking in the room when there isn't was annoying. I think they need to check the ventilation of this place. After a few nights, the smoke that seems to be dubbed into the room was too much for me. 

I will give them credit for moving us into another room when we had a group of partiers next to us all night. I sound like an old lady but I am not. When you figure in the time change of 3 hours and go to be at 3a.m., I was up for almost 24 hours. The walls were so thin, it was as if the people in the room next to me were in my face yelling. I had to sleep a few hours!! 

So the last complaint I have is, and it may sound petty but I was served a bill at check out, for  the ""phone"". You are charged $4 a day, every day for the phone in your room even if you don't use it. Why? They just took my cabfare home.",1,0,1

""LOCATION! LOCATION! LOCATION!""

This hotel is on my favorite end of the Las Vegas Strip...but best of all it's in walking distance and centralized between the likes of the Bellagio, Monte Carlo, MGM Grand, Luxor, and Manadalay Bay. Location is one of the reasons why I highly favor this hotel.

Now we're not talking Waldorf-Astoria Hotel so don't expect Park Avenue perks when it comes to staying here.  But for Las Vegas glitz and glam its a nice fascade of New York Imagery.
http:\/\/ltierney.demon.co.uk\/webimages\/galleries\/12\/fullsize\/IMG_4394.JPG

Now...I'm not much on gambling....

But when I am in sin city... I do like to check out the glitz , a show or two, people watch among the tourist from all over the world, check out the local eats...and most of all...relax when I want to get away from the crowds...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Which is why we like to stay at one NY-NY's Spa deluxe Rooms.
http:\/\/www.nynyhotelcasino.com\/images\/hotel\/center_hotel_spa.jpg

Rates From: $155 a night

A comfortable pad with 400-500 square feet...one king-size bed, sitting area and large clover-shape spa tub thoughtfully positioned in the corner of the bedroom.  The bathroom is very roomy with an over-size shower and vanity.   And there's more than enough space to unload your luggage & lay out all your gear for your Vegas stay.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Living the Vegas life with your own spa in your room is the way to go!  And keep in mind I do believe the Luxor and Caesar's offer similar Spa Deluxe rooms.

I highly recommend!

We got there, checked in, and when we got to our room we learned that they had put us in a different room than we had requested. My husband called the front desk and talked to Emily (he says he's 99% sure her name was Emily), who informed us that there were no king rooms available (despite us booking our room THREE MONTHS AGO) but that we could be moved the next day and she would waive the daily resort charge for the entire trip to apologize for the inconvenience this caused us (as we had to interrupt our plans for the next day so we could move rooms). We were greatly appreciative of that. 

The restaurants and stores are pretty good here, like there's a good variety. 

Some of the rooms can be extremely loud. I got four hours of sleep our first night here (not an exaggeration - I took this number right off of my Fitbit app!) because the first room we were in was right next to an elevator that was running during all hours of the night. Along with that, we dealt with a terrible AC unit that was ice cold but when you tried to turn on the heater, it would start smoking. There were people screaming at each other in the middle of the night. The beds are somewhat comfortable. The bathrooms are pretty awkwardly set up, with the door barely clearing the toilet. It's an aging hotel and it shows. 

I thought the arcade was pretty cool until we realized that half of the games don't even work. 

We checked out this morning to make sure that the resort charge was in fact waived. The individual who helped us was Denise, who was oh so pleasant (sarcasm). She confirmed that the resort charge was waived for ONE DAY out of ""goodwill"" and reminded us once again that we didn't get the room we had reserved the first night because it just wasn't available.

Earlier in the evening we went up to our room to freshen up before heading out.  There was a Hispanic woman who was strangely following us as we walked to our room. When we stopped to open our door she slowly walked past us.  It was strange and I made a comment to my husband that I almost thought she was going to confront us.  

We got ready and left the hotel to walk the strip.  We didn't get very far though, and turned back to NYNY and had dinner then gambled a bit.  We then decided to go back to our room.  

Upon walking in I noticed an empty overturned coffee cup partially under our bed, with light lipstick on the rim.  Right then my husband noticed his Adidas were missing.  As we looked around it was obvious our things were rifled through and my cellphone I left to charge was also gone.    Other items were missing, including his wallet and my cash. 

Called Security who came up to take the report. Gave her the coffee cup which she said she'd ""take into evidence"" and we questioned her about checking the elevator cameras for the Hispanic woman or anyone holding a similar coffee cup (she laughed and said that was a good idea).  She said we'd need to wait until morning for the next shift (???!?!)  She went to the armoire and asked if we had used the plastic laundry bag that was usually kept there. We didn't.  And it was gone. She mentioned that thieves will use that bag to hold all the items they remove from the room.  We had no idea it was even there.  Obviously an in-house employee would, right?  

So now we lay wide awake in a different room, same hotel.  Management moved us to a different room and credited our account $100 to be used as food\/beverage credit.  Yeah, sure, the first thing we want to do is leave our room and belongings to go spend that credit.  

Up until now we were enjoying our stay here. Now we can't wait to get the F outta here.

Hotel\/accommodations- check in was by fast, elevators no line and fast, hallways clean, staff very nice, pool was rather small for the size of the hotel, wifi included in resort fee, valet was actually really quick.

Restaurants-I have to say that this hotel has a ton of selections for food which I liked about this hotel. And a lot of choices to fit a person budget.

View was amazing, plenty of space, and the Jacuzzi was a great bonus. 

Casino is small but we kind of liked that. Italian place has buy one get one free breakfast when you stay there during the week -  the food was delicious. plenty of shops, and easy access to MGM sky bridge and Luxor\/Mandalay tram at excalibur. 

Location is a bit south on the strip but no biggie. We walked to the north end and caught a lyft ride back for 7$. 

Only complaint was the smug bartender at the center bar, but i guess everyone has a bad day... everyone else at this place was VERY friendly and helpful.

We started with a ""Strip view"" Madison Avenue room; we paid extra for the ""view"". We were more than disappointed with this view (or lack thereof). We immediately requested to move and were just as quickly accommodated - the service was great. The view we ended up with was on the back side away of the hotel looking at the mountains and the city, but we both agreed it was better and it was actually spectacular.

The location is OK, but OK is all it is (one of the negatives). At least when you walk out of the hotel you are directly on the strip. But, you have a bit of a walk to get to the main action.

The rooms and hotel (and casino) were clean and well kept up.
The wifi worked well through-out our room and lobby.
The bed was comfortable (a little on the firmer side), but the pillows were all the fluffy type that go flat within an hour of laying on them.

The casino is in the hotel lobby rather than an attached separate building; I found this convenient if you want to gamble. There were slot machines as well as table games, but this was one of the smaller casinos we visited. With that said, it was nice to have them right there when you come down to the lobby, or on the way back to your room.

The smoke was overwhelming in the casino (and the restaurants since they are shared space). I know, I know, this is Vegas what did I expect? Sure, there was smoke in ALL the casinos we visited, but some\/many of the casinos did a much better job of controlling the odor. This was a large part of the negative for this hotel, since the smell was everywhere. We expected a nice hotel like this one to smell better since even some of the much older casinos (on Fremont) did a better job with the smoke smell. Here, as soon as you enter the building you can't get away it.

The hotel provides many options to eat, but none of the places we ate would be considered fantastic. We ate at both of the nicer restaurants and neither one of us was impressed.

The parking garage was free, easily accessed, and has two entrances into the hotel\/casino.

I didn't stay here, didn't gamble here, didn't see a show here, and didn't ride the rollercoaster. I did eat here once, at Gallagher's Steakhouse.  And I walked through it a bunch, as I stayed at The Excaliber, and NY-NY was kind of a gateway to the rest of the strip.  But mostly, it was my second favorite casino - Paris was my favorite - and if I had to choose only one casino to remain in Vegas, it would have been NY-NY.

This is because Las Vegas is a strange, frightening place. I grew up in the suburbs of NYC and have lived in Philly and the suburbs of Philly. I'm an east coast lad.

And Vegas is NOT the east coast, in big and small ways.  It's a different color! It's all pink and yellow and red... and there are no trees, except palm trees (which make no sense in 35deg Vegas February weather), and it's flat everywhere, but then there are these mountains rising in the distance... the buildings are low and the city just... stops.  You can walk 10 minutes away from the strip and find motels and fast food and a whole lot of... nothing.  No traffic, no apartments... open, undeveloped space.  Where do the people that work in that city live?  It baffles me.  Try walking in any direction when you're in Center City, Philly or Times Square, NY... are you going to find undeveloped lots or lazy motels?

Vegas is truly the city that doesn't sleep, with old women sitting at slots at 4 in the morning.  Smoking appears to be allowed everywhere, and Hispanics in hoodies line up in rows along the sidewalk trying to get you to take cards advertising prostitutes by snapping them back and forth, as if you'd say no to 10 in a row and then yes to the 11th.  Everything is a mockup of somewhere else, a city that doesn't have its own soul so it borrows and exaggerates on everything else it sees.  Then it bedazzles it, adds a light show, and charges twice as much.

Ok, getting off track.  Basically... when I was outside, and I looked over at the NY-NY... it felt a little like home.  and when I was overwhelmed by the smoke and the flashing lights and the hooker cards... it was a good feeling.  And when I went inside the casino... that fake version of NYC felt more real than any other place I went in Vegas.

Less melodramatically... I liked the casinos who stayed true to their themes.  Luxor is a giant pyramid with a sphinx outside, but inside, it's just a sleek black and gold colored casino.  And it's the same with most of them.  But the city themed ones, Paris and NY, they took it to heart.  The stores and restaurants a mocked up to make you feel like you're on streets outside, the foods and gifts stay true to the theme as well.  Outside and inside, they're dedicated to the conceit.  And I liked that a lot.

So I can't tell you about the rooms or the tables or the rides, but I can tell you I was happy NY-NY was right in Sin City, and if you're an east coast adventurer looking for a feel of home, this caricature of it might be able to get you through.",1,2,2

We reserved a 2 bed hotel room and once we checked-in (which was on time) they told us ""sorry we are all out of 2 bed rooms."" This is seriously not acceptable, but what could we do. We got a roll out bed with our one-bed room.

Food: 
There are not that many food options here. Pizza, fast food, and unhealthy options. The only thing that was a plus, was the 24 hour Starbucks inside. 

The nightlife: 
The bars were a-ok. Nothing special. There was one bar with a man signing Friday\/Saturday night that was so loud and had a horrible voice. I don't want to sound mean, but it was awful! Every time I passed by there, I had to literally cover my ears. 

So why 3 stars, if this sounds like a 1 star place? 
The room was clean, comfy bed, and decent view. I loved the hotel theme and there is a cool looking rollercoaster, although I would never go on it in 105+ degrees outside.

Hot Dogs, Asian, Italian, etc. The decor inside really makes you feel like you are in New York...that is if every street had slot machines on them. I would probably stay here again, but ask for a room away from the rollercoaster.",0,0,0

Positives:
- Cheap room rates!
- Plenty of food options (Food Court)
- Cheap tables (BJ\/Craps\/Roulette)
- New Beds!  So damn comfortable!  
- Parking structure is fairly close to the lobby.

Negatives:
- Non peak weekend and our rooms were located in a smoking tower.
- It was either way too warm in our room or too frickn cold!  They need to go digital on the thermostats.
- Our room was close to the Roller Coaster....  Thicker glass please!  I have sensitive ears when Im hungover in the morning and I hear the roller coaster with people screaming.  =)

We picked the New York New York because it was cheap and we knew they had several casual bar and restaurant choices which we thought would work well for a large group. As a hotel it was satisfactory but it didn't take us long to realize that the New York New York is not one of the 'happening' spots and we spent most of our time on the other side of the strip. That being said, here are some pros and cons. 
Pro's
-The mini New York skyline and landmarks are pretty spectacular. I think from the outside this is one of the most visually exciting spots in Vegas.
-The rooms were well decorated, spacious and comfortable.
-The cocktail waitresses were attentive with the free drinks even when I was sitting at the penny slots.
-I ordered a birthday cake a few days in advance of my arrival. It was at the door beautifully decorated at the exact time I had specified. 
-As mentioned above, there are a ton of cheap and fast food options downstairs that range from burgers to a New York Deli. While none of the food was spectacular I will say that it was a great alternative to going out for a pricey group dinner at a sit down place every night. We were able to bring food up to our room and chow down with our own cocktails while getting ready for the evening and listening to music on the iPod dock which was a nice in-room amenity. 
-Guests at New York New York can also use the pool at the Monte Carlo where we found plenty or sun, chaise lounges and tasty frozen cocktails. 
Cons
-The vibe inside the casino isn't nearly as bustling and high energy as other casinos that we stopped in. The hay day for this place has clearly come and gone and the crowd here seemed a little sorry. 
-Our room keys got demagnetized and wouldn't work about 3 times. It was a huge pain to constantly have to traipse downstairs, through the casino and wait in line at the front desk. They did give us a $35 credit when we complained - but still- the constant key issues were very annoying.
-I came down for coffee one morning as some of the restaurants were opening up and there were big garbage dumpsters out for guests to smell and see. Although I like the New York city street theme, I don't need it to be that authentic.
-Based on what I've heard from other friends that go to Vegas a lot, I can tell that neither the New York New York or the Monte Carlo have the best pool scene. Both pools were pleasant enough but lacked that party atmosphere you look for when you are on a Vegas vacay. 
-The action is at the other end of the strip which isn't exactly close when it's a million degrees outside. 
New York New York served its purpose but I would never stay there again, or recommend it. The money we spent shuttling back and forth to the more exciting end of the strip could have just been spent on a hotel that was closer to the action.",1,0,0

Cons: Muppet at front desk added up our iniial room fee wrong by over $600 what a mess. rectified though
You pay $20 to have access to wifi its a resort fee, not great. should be covered in room fee etc
bathroom so so, the showers are old and a bit out dated, but clean so not all bad.
tv channels or lack there of, alot were locked out.
cigarette smoke in our room, even though it was none smoking..unacceptable.

Pros
the reason i gave it 3 stars where it really should have been 2, was the room service
room servie was great, goodfood big portions, nice staff.
great view of roller coaster and vegas

There were no extra frills in the room, it was a simple suite without a mini bar or jacuzzi tub; however, it was clean and quiet.  We ordered room service for breakfast, it was delivered in the allocated time and was well prepared.  The prices were high, a pot of coffee would have been $8.95 + mandatory $3 service fee + 18% gratuity.

The casino restrooms were acceptable, but not amazing.  There were all the necessary items available; however, there was no hand lotion or other frills available tht someone gambling for 2-3 hours might appreciate.  

We visited the the Sunday Brunch at Ting Ting restaurant, and it was confusing.  There was a very limited selection of brunch food, the food quality was not in par with the price, and the service was slow.  I do not recommend it and I regret wasting my Sunday brunch at this location.

The casino dealers were, without exception, over 40 years old.  They were pleasant and nice, with the exception of pit boss Bob Miener.  We placed lots of dealer bets for tips, which they seemed to enormously appreciate.  When all was said and done, we left lots of money with the casino.",0,0,0

So thanks to a special player rate promotion offer, I decided to gave this place a try since we decided to take the kids on this Vegas trip and figured they should have a kid friendly area with the coaster they have there.  When we arrived to check in, the front desk staff were very nice and friendly.  I was told that our room was quite far from the elevators, but I can call the next morning to have them change rooms for me.  What really stopped me from giving this place a 4 star was the actual walk to our room from the elevators.  It was a bit confusing with so many twists and turns just to get to our room.  It really felt life forever to just get to our room.  The lady that checked us in wasn't kidding about being far from the elevators.  The rooms were small, but clean.  Another reason for the 3 stars was the TV.  We had issues with the signal and the channels went black, so that was a bummer.  At least the wifi was working (comes with the resort fee), so the kids had something to keep them busy while we were in our room.  The next morning we were able to get a room closer to the elevator, so our next day stay was a little better.   The TV worked fine in the beginning, but we ended up having the same signal issue as the last room later on that night.

Another pet peeve that I had was the cocktail service when I was at the tables.  While I was the table to kill some time before dinner, it took a while for someone to come by to take drink orders and when the girl finally came and I placed my order, she never came back with my drink!  I was sitting there for a good hour since my order and was so bummed that I didn't get my drink before I had to leave for dinner.

The kids seemed to enjoy themselves when we took them to the arcade here.  I think I'm just spoiled by my stay from places like the Palazzo to Encore, so NYNY wasn't impressive to me.  But honestly, in comparison to Luxor... it's way better and the prices aren't going to leave a hole in your pockets for a night stay.",2,0,1

We booked this probably before or after our intended stay in September so the price was a deal! I believe we got a night free!

Now, prior to actually staying here I didn't even know where you head in order to check in, but wherever the taxi drops you off, you head to the left of the casino and you'll find the registration. 

What I semi-disapprove of is how there are FOUR towers. Now this was only a downside because we wanted to be near our cousin, but he ended up being in a completely different tower. Our floor was located in the Century towers and I believe our room had part of the word ROK on it, we're still trying to fig that out. 

Twanyways....we had a strip-view room which meant we walked down endless hallways to get to the LAST room. Now, if you don't care much for views, which I certainly don't care about anymore, I'd recommend letting them know you want a room closer to the elevator.

Now, I thought the distance from our room to the elevator was pretty long, but that wasn't until I visited my cousin's room. I don't remember which tower he was located in, but it was behind the eateries. Where I expected his room to be, we continued to walk in about 2-3 more hallways!!! SO LONG!! That's terrible if you're going to be staggering to your room at 3 in the morning!! Or if you're lazy like me! (and my ankle is still healing from being fractured)

Other than that, the location of the hotel is good on the strip and it has direct access to Excalibur and MGM. I didn't discover the Excalibur bridge until the day we were leaving. 

The late night eats they have here are yummy too! They have pizza, pretzels, hot dogs, and all of that other fatty stuff you'll stuff in your face to suck up all the alcohol from the many Fat Tuesday drinks you sucked down all day\/weekend. 

Unfortunately, this last visit we didn't get to see our dealer Taison =(

This is one of those themed casinos that's fun to visit. I think it was great all the themed casinos they have built here. Seems like that are getting out of that. That's sad to see. It's part of the allure. It's part of why people come to Vegas.

Reasons I hated this place:

- found hair all over my shower. Like full balls of hair in the shower\/on the wall. I am blonde and this hair was black, so like...? I guess the shower was not cleaned between guests?

- water was shutoff the morning before I left. I came back to my room around 3 am and the water was off...completely. Called the front desk and they sent up three mini bottles of water but this didn't help me shower or wash my face the next morning 

- more hair (not mine) found in the sink

Vegas makes it tough to choose.  You literally have every option under the sun for... well... everything!  We decided to stay in New York New York the week before thanksgiving since the price was right, we like it's location on the strip and we prefer MGM properties.   Overall it was a fabulous stay.   Sure, the rooms are slightly dated looking but they are huge, affordable and insanely comfortable.   I also love the fact that it feels less sprawling than other vegas strip resorts.  We come down the elevator and *bam* we are in the casino or next to F&B options.   2 minutes later we are walking along the strip.  Try doing that in some of the other resorts!  

F&B options are varied and good.  The America 24 hr diner is surprisingly decent as is the Italian restaurant.   Service is pretty decent for Vegas and most employees are pretty friendly.   

The best advice I can give is to book the level of room that you want to actually stay in.  Don't rely on the hope of an upgrade (free or paid) and then be disappointed when it doesn't come through. 

Yes, the resort fee is ridiculously high, but so are almost all other strip properties.  Yes it's frustrating that they charge for parking now, but so do most other strip properties now.",0,0,0

Houskeeping was very friendly, 9 Fine Irishmen had a great band and dancer our first night. Lost a star because of the big brawl in the piano bar that went on for about two minutes before security got there. No reason patrons should be breaking up fights.

Except for the rediculous fight, the public areas are fun, the room was so-so, service hit and miss.

The front desk staff seemed friendlier than the rest of the staff though. While walking through the hotel and dining at the various eateries, the staff made it seem like it was a bother to serve and help you. The staff rarely smiled. The only person who was truly friendly was the gentleman who worked at Hershey's out in the kiosk. He gave us some free samples and made us feel welcome at the hotel.

The hotel itself has a confusing configuration. If you checked in at one of the kiosks, you get a card key but have no idea what tower you have been assigned. The email the hotel sends you does not indicate it either. You can either access the pool by walking through the hotel lobby in your swim gear or go to the third floor, walk down a hallway and take another elevator that brings you to the first floor and to the pool. It would make life a bit easier if the designers of the hotel would make going to the pool more fluid.

The room we stayed in smelled like smoke even though it was a non-smoking room. Perhaps, the hotel could separate the smoking rooms and non-smoking rooms in different buildings. If the building shares the same ventilation system, then the smoke goes into all the rooms. 

New York New York is a reasonably priced hotel, but I feel that if the hotel is charging a resort fee it should actually have some amenities.

When I came to check in, there was a portion of the counter that was closed because the roof was leaking water in multiple places.  They were using trash cans to catch the water.  I don't know what happened there.  The staff at the check in counter all seemed nice.  We paid about $73 for 1 night on a Thursday and it was from Travelocity's website.

When I was here, it didn't seem like I was there for leisure because I had business to take care of which will bring me to my next point: the business center.  They had a business center where you can check your email, fax, and print stuff.  I needed to photocopy something and there was nobody there to help.  The other person who was there tried to help even though that's not his position.  All the computers in the business center require you to use a credit card (maybe a debit card too?) in order to use their computers.  The prices varied for each transaction.  Eventually, I got everything I needed to do taken care of.

One thing I liked about the room we stayed in was the internet.  I think it was included but I forgot.  It was an ethernet cable that you could plug into your laptop.  The room was roomy and the bathroom was good, too.  I don't think anything stood out in the room so that's all I'm going to say about the room.

There was an arcade but I didn't get to look at it when everything was turned on; instead, I quickly walked through when it was shut down in the morning.

We stayed on the sixth floor.  There was a really loud annoying sound going on all night.

They all stayed quite a ways up from us.  It was so loud our friends could hear it when we were on the phone with them.

We had a king size bed and our hotel room totally sucked as far as size.  It was the most cramped room I've ever been in.  You open the door and there's your bed!  The bathroom was larger than our room.  I recommend going for a two queen bed room, as your room will be bigger for the same price.  We were tripping over our stuff in the middle of the night.  Otherwise the furnishings are nice and the hotel room was clean.

On the outside, I'm wondering if there is supposed to be water around this place?  We were standing on the bridge to the Paris and noticed a bunch of pipes in a concrete thing under us.  Didn't look very attractive.  Perhaps there were budget cuts.

When I arrived on a Sunday, at valet I double checked with him he informed me it was $18 for valet for every 24 hours if I was a guest and $10 for self parking. While I was terribly annoyed, I realized I didn't specify valet or self parking when I made my reservation. I checked out Tuesday. To return on Thursday. Again, I confirmed the price for valet. I was told as of the day before the prices went UP! Valet was now $20 and self was $12. What annoys me is a lot of people drive to Vegas. Wouldn't it make sense that in the multiple emails sent from NYNY they notify you of the parking fees?

The pool isn't overly exciting but it is kinda cool looking up at the ""skyscrapers"" and having the rollercoaster whizzing by. Very family-oriented pool (only 3- and 4-feet deep, volleyball net).  Pretty good location but not as central as I always think it is. I would stay here again for a bargain, but I'm always wanting to stay at a new hotel each time so I probably won't come back anytime soon. Good coffee at Il Fornaio downstairs by the casino floor (and help yourself to the ice water they put out, very handy on a 110-F day!). Good people-watching at some of the slots near the escalator to Coyote Ugly and the passovers to the other hotels. I always want to go to the piano bar but it's always too packed.  I would give it a 6th star if I could because I left my iPhone charger in the room and thought it was long gone, but still called Lost and Found and they took my info and remembered to check the room when the new guests checked out and actually called me back saying they have it!!

And the reason this gets 4 stars is due to the fact that their roller coaster was so rough, violent and scary that it pretty much frightened the living son of Jesus out of my brother and I.   

My brother and I are veterans of some of the most notorious roller coasters in the US.   And upon walking by New York New York, and hearing the screams of the people riding, we thought it looked ""cute"".   We noticed the signs warning people with heart conditions, etc., not to ride it and just thought ""Yeah, yeah yeah, whatever, bring it on.""  

I can tell you why the people were screaming.   I know now...    It's because they were terrified of dieing!     This coaster shakes more than any I have ever rode in my life, and from an engineering point of view, when riding, I was 100% certain that the wheels were going to break and we were going to be killed.   I was totally sure of that.   In fact my brother says that I screamed ""I want off this ****** NOW!!!!"".    I don't recall that, but once you're on it, there ain't no one to listen to your demand that it stop.....     :)

After that ride, our parents were laughing and said that we looked ""pale"".    So we rode it again.    

After the second ride my brother could not stop laughing as I had ""slobber"" all over my shirt.   I don't recall ""slobbering"" but sure enough I was covered in slime.     Those two rides are all I care for on this roller coaster.   I won't do it again.

Parking is difficult due to construction and hard to find if you haven't stayed here before.

This place was okay, you are basically paying for your location. Even though the rooms are clean they are sub par and nothing special. I would not stay here again because of that. Most basic rooms in Vegas have a fridge and coffee pot in them, so that was a big disappointment for me to see our room didn't even have those basic items. There are way better places to stay at in Vegas. If you are looking for a higher quality room at a lesser value, I would make a different choice.

I had only heard of the bigger hotels like MGM Grand, Belaggio, and Paris, but figured you couldn't go wrong with this hotel! Well... You definitely CAN go wrong with this hotel.

Night 1 (8\/8) - Arrive at Check-In. We had 2 rooms booked, each with 2 double beds, with a view. They only had 1 double room and 1 king size room. They informed us that if we wanted the other double room (that we reserved well in advance, January I believe), we'd have to take the king for 1 night and then repack everything and move to the double room. Guess reservations are useless here... We were staying in the New Yorker. We got off the elevator on the 16th floor in the middle of the tower. We had a good 5 minute walk just to get to our room. There is only one block of elevators in this tower and if you were stuck with Room 1604 like we were, you've got a LONG walk. Got up to our room noticed it was a little toasty in the room, walked over to the A\/C to find it on the lowest setting... Guess we ordered a sauna in our room too!

Day\/Night 2 (8\/9) - We decided to keep the king size room because it was too much of a hassle to pack everything back up. We left our room with our towels on the hang racks (as they instructed if we DIDN'T want them replaced by housekeeping) and came back a few hours later to find our towels gone (we had 3 bath towels, 2 wash cloths, and a hand towel), and replace with only 2 bath towels and nothing else. We called down to housekeeping and told them we were missing towels and they said they'd get them up here right away. We left the room and walked the strip a bit, grabbed dinner, and came back about 3 hours later to find no towels. Called housekeeping again and they told us they'd get them up here right away. 45 minutes later and we finally got a knock on the door. But instead of giving us 1 bath towel, 2 wash cloths, and 1 hand towel, we got 3 bath towels, 3 wash cloths, and no hand towel. I guess we made it work, but little attention to detail.

Day\/Night 3 (8\/10) - I FINALLY realized what the god awful stench was on the casino floor... It's stale cigarette smoke mixed with some sh*tty air freshener that makes the cigarette smoke worse.

Day\/Night 4 (8\/11) - Went to the Grand Canyon South Rim, so it was a relief to get out of this place.

Day\/Night 5 (8\/12) - Needed to get online to buy some NHL Stadium Series tickets. Tried logging onto their WiFi, and that's a joke. IF you can connect, it's usually slower than molasses, and frequently gives errors when it won't load web pages. So we ran down to the Business Center to use a computer. Minimum $5 just to log on... I guess they're not making any money on the casino floor, they need to make up costs elsewhere. We also noticed a number of people that walked into the Business Center asking for towels too (common theme, no?).",0,0,0

The spa suite in NYNY was very nice. We went for my husband's birthday.  When I first walked into the room there was a smell like cigarettes,  but it might just be the hotel smell.  After a while I got used to it and didn't notice it for the rest of the 3 night stay.  The room was clean and we had a great view on the 23rd floor.  The room service was great.  The food was good,  not too bad on price,  and it was delivered within 20 minutes. 
THE SPA-the spa is the reason we went.  It was in the room so you could still watch the TV from it.  Very relaxing.  The only thing is that after the first night we used it my husband and I got red bumps on our stomach and arms. They looked like bug bites! I goggled it and we came to the conclusion that it was a bacteria in the spa  (this is OUR conclusion). We think it was the spa because when we got in we didn't have red bumps and when we got out we took a shower, dried off and that's when we noticed the bites\/bumps.  I called the manager the next morning to inform her and to ask if we could have chlorine wipes to clean the spa. She was very nice but said they didn't have any.  She said she would notify the room cleaning manager.  I was ready to just leave at that point but my husband said we could get rubbing alcohol at the CVS near the hotel and rinse the spa before using it again.  That worked! No new bites\/bumps after that.  We poured rubbing alcohol and a little tea tree oil in the spa before each time we used it. After that we were able to enjoy the rest of our stay there. 
Would we stay again? Yes, I would just pack rubbing alcohol and tea tree oil so we could apply it to the spa before we used it.",2,0,0

This is probably one of the few properties I stayed at where I stayed during a time where going to the pool was possible. For some reason I tend to avoid Vegas when it's a reasonable weather outside.

We lost another 30 minutes there. Needless to say we couldn't make it to where we had our reservations for which had been planned for a while now. My partner was beyond pissed so we waited until the morning at check out to talk to a manager about the domino effect not having a CLEAN, strip view room ready when we got there. From the time we got there to the time we walked into the room we had already wasted an hour and forty minutes.

We talked to the check out lady and said she would not charge the resort fees a nice $38 savings (WOW!) and insult if you ask me. I then proceeded to tell her that it wasn't enough due to all the time wasted and making us miss our reservations, she then told us she might have a letter in the back to where we can get a free upgrade at our next stay. (Who would want to stay again after that experience) so i kindly declined and explained this to her. She then went to talk to what I am assuming is the manager and came back saying they would comp us a room for ONE night at a later time which of course would have black out dates. 
We agreed because it sounded like the best they could do which still doesn't make me happy. She then proceeded to say that they were ""out"" of letters and they would send me an email with the letter ""tomorrow"" which was yesterday...of course I still haven't received anything, oh and they STILL charged me the $70 they said I would not be charged!

They completely ruined our FIRST New Years experience in Vegas! The LEAST they can do is comp us a few days with no black out dates or another chance at having a good experience in Vegas on New Years Eve\/Day! SMH!",0,2,0

Reservation was for a Park Avenue, King Bed Room.

I arrived on a Sunday around 7:30PM and was told that they no longer had king bed non-smoking rooms even though that's what I reserved.  So they gave me a double bed room, 12th floor.  Upon arriving I was less than pleased with the room.  The desk was in the middle of the beds facing the back wall.  It was awkward.  The view was crap (to be expected for the lower paid rooms) and lastly the window blind was stuck open!  It couldn't close.  That's no fun when you're trying to sleep while the sun comes up.

I went back down to the reservation desk to pick up my complimentary buffet vouchers as I forgot earlier.  This time I met with a different person.  I mentioned that my window blind was broken and asked if there were some way to fix it.  Instead he said he could move rooms for me and I asked if there were a King room available as that was my original reservation.  Rest assured (just a mere 20 mins after my initial check in) a King room was magically available!  I'm not sure if the original female check in person did their due diligence.

The king room worked much better for me because I got a bigger bed (obvious) and the desk was to the side of the room.  And I got a higher floor (27 versus 12) with a slightly better view.  Everything else between the King Room and the Double Bed room were basically the same.

It was pretty easy to walk from here to MGM, Excaliber, and Tropicana hotels.  The Hersey World store was a nice place buy some souvenirs.  I enjoyed the food court area some nights if I were a rush to get a bite to eat.  You get a younger vibe at this hotel than like...Tropicana.

The Brooklyn Bridge area was nice to hang out and listen to street music.

The worst part about this casino\/hotel and will keep me from staying here again is the tone and mood of so many dealers. Some (very few) were a ton of fun but my friends and i encountered quite a few irritable and obviously bored dealers here. They would snap at us and other gamblers and were often caught staring off into space with absolutely zero interest or attention paid to the table and guests. We learned that tips are shared with all dealers at the end of the night which seems like a really bad way to incent them to be engaged in the guests and create a fun atmosphere. They get tips whether they are nice or not making it feel like they just don't have to try therefore they don't. Last year when we were here we picked new york new york because the gaming area was super fun with the dealers, this year they killed that :( sad...they also have awful wi-fi but that felt the same all over the strip there is most likely too much interference so not their fault but it is part of the surprise $20 a day resort fee which was disappointing",2,0,0

It is interesting to peer out of your window and see a roller coaster go by your window. 

Since it was my first time staying at this hotel, I was dreading having to enter into this property since it is located on the NW corner of Tropicana and Las Vegas Blvd. Since I was exiting off the 15 freeway, I wasn't sure if there was an entrance off of Tropicana. As I was making my approach, I did notice an entrance off of Tropicana Avenue. However, the left turn lane can be easily missed at night. Also, there is a long curb delineating the left turn lane so if you miss it, you will have to enter through Las Vegas Blvd which is not really the best idea due to the traffic congestion. When you get to the parking garage, there is an attendant who supposedly monitors people entering the garage but all he does is just say hello to you. Once you find parking, there are two pedestrian bridges that lead into the property on the 3rd floor. Actually, they both lead into the lobby registration area so don't worry about getting lost although the signage can be spotty at this property as I was confused initially as to where registration was.

Being that it is a MGM property, many of the properties are right next to each other such as MGM across the street, Monte Carlo, Excalibur, Luxor, and Mandalay Bay are pretty close by if you just take the free tram.

I love that New York New York has a wide range of restaurants from budget to pricey food, there is something for everyone. I really wanted to eat a Nathan's hot dog, but of course got distracted from all the other food and entertainment choices on the strip. Since I was inebriated for most of the time in Vegas, I found myself stumbling to Sirrico's Pizza frequently. 

Even though I was on vacation, I found myself also heading to their gym on the 3rd floor of the Empire Tower. It was actually a very decent facility, must bigger than the gym at the Tropicana. Since the gym was included in the resort fee, I might as well use it since I was paying for it. 

The casino area had a wide range of games that seemed to be quite reasonably priced for the strip that is, although if you wanted lower limit tables and slot machines, the downtown Las Vegas area would be better for that.

The elevators are not clearly marked or distinguished from the other towers (there are several sets of elevators). Seriously awful planning on the hotels part. I think it took us 1\/2 an hour to find the right set of elevators. 

The room was on the 33rd floor and when we arrived I noticed that there is a pink film on the window. It gives a weird red hue during the daytime and makes the room look even smaller and darker than it is at night. There is no source of natural lighting in the room what so ever.

If I need an inexpensive, clean, but no frills room, I usually go Rio, Luxor, Westin, or, now, NYNY.  For luxury rooms, the CityCenter or Encore.  For a true getaway, it's Green Valley Ranch (which also tends to be very budget friendly vs the strip).  

Anyways I enjoyed my stay at NYNY.  I received a comped room via MyVegas and also paid for a 2nd night ($80).  When I arrived, I decided to upgrade to the Madison Ave room for an additional $20\/night.  The rooms didn't look that much different, although the Madison Ave room has a pillowtop and 50 more sq ft.  

My room was a long trek from the elevator, which was probably the most annoying thing about the room.  The room itself was slightly antiquated.  A large armoire stood near the king sized bed, with a small table and desk along with 2 comfortable chairs, which made it a nice place for a conversation.  Central air was available.  The bathroom was a bit outdated...no individual tub\/shower, it was a combo.  The necessary amenities were included (which I think are the same as Luxor).  

The gym was small but decent enough.  It had freeweights, some cardio machines, a pull up bar setup, leg press, shoulder press, and a few other machines.  

There wasn't a mini-fridge in the room at all, which was mildly annoying, since I like to keep extra water in the room.

We upgraded from a Park Hotel room to a Marquis suite and I gotta say, unless you're in need of the mini Jacuzzi that comes with the upgrade, it's not worth the money. We were in a group, and had three rooms at three different levels, and I'd say the Madison Ave. room is all you really need.

The hotel is fun. The pool is no frills, it's got some good music, but it's family oriented and not the day club atmosphere. The pizza when you're coming back from a late night hits the spot, and the Greenwich Village Coffee company beat Starbucks hands down in my book for a good pastry and cup of iced coffee. 

The rooms were clean, the service was good, and so it goes. The one down is a down not just for New York New York but all the M Life hotels- not only is their loyalty product beyond confusing, the customer service for that in particular was incredibly horrendous. I looked into it since you can transfer points between that and Hyatt now, but I must say, it's nothing impressive whatsoever.

Service was great. All the staff were friendly and helpful 5 stars

Parking has walkways to casino

Casino: smaller but easy layout in a round. Bar and food accessible and affordable. Nothing super fancy. 

Food: love Nine Fine Irishmen. Very tasty and relaxed setting. Pizza is good on second floor. 

Seen Zumanity in the past and enjoyed it

Room: We booked the spa room for the large jacuzzi. This is the only selling point of the room. This is where they lost the stars. The light flickered. The lamp was possessed. The outlet by the tv ( the easy access one for our phone chargers) would spark and turn off. The dresser was missing knobs. These aren't deal breakers. The room was clean. The bed was comfortable but this room didn't have a fridge or minibar. There were a few little things, annoying things. We didn't call them up for maintenance because the point to be on vacation is to have a stress free stay. These things should have been checked. The last thing I want to do is waste time moving rooms and repacking all my crap up when I have a dinner and show both nights. 

If this was a comp room or the cheap room, I would kinda understand... that it's just to pass out before you go out and party again. This was a SPA room. I wanted to spend time in it. Soaking and relaxing. The lights flickered - not that I didn't use the other lights but it's not the experience I paid for.

My only two complaints are that our room was right near the roller coaster which made it hard to sleep at times and the fact that this hotel is far from all the action in the middle of the strip.

Not bad.  Great variety of games, various denominations and we can often play here for quite some time.  GF got lucky during our May trip and won $$$$ here, so we were all happy.  Service doesn't come around as often as we'd like.  Actually, come to think of it, floor assistance took forever when a slot was being funky, but it's okay.  We'll always come back here.  It's convenient, it's tight-spaced (which I normally don't like about casinos, but it works well in here).  Coyote Ugly upstairs (yeah! for boots!).  We ate at the italian restaurant downstairs, and that was okay.  Wouldn't necessarily eat there again.  As the server was pouring oil (for the bread), I pushed over my plate (because I want my own) and she looked and me and RUDELY said, you know this is oil for the bread, right?!?!?!?!

Invited guest line is supposed to be VIP treatment yet they only have 1 rep working at a time.  My last stay there I had to wait 20 min for the guest in front of me to finish strangling the reps throat about the best deal for 1 more night.  I could've gone through the normal line 5 times if I tried and wouldn't have missed the first 2 rounds of a prelim UFC fight if it weren't for this.

Also on my most recent trip the people in the room next to us seem to just be blasting music all night and it took 3 calls over a 45 min period before the security finally showed up to enter and quiet them down.  It was 4 in the morning and the music was so loud they couldn't even hear him knocking. It shouldn't take any calls for these people to be quoted down.

I also liked their eateries better than the nicer hotels. It's weird that Paris and Venetian have McD's and other disgusting chain food eateries. NY NY actually tries to stick to a theme...

-1: The casino area: I know. I loved most of it, but the arcade and roller coaster have to go. Noisy (some of their rooms have double-paned windows, but not all) and attracts a ""family"" atmosphere. Bleh. It's Vegas - leave the kids at home or go to Circus Circus. Plus it takes away from the theme. 

On a side note, we looked up a review and they were listed as a kid-friendly Vegas hotel. Definitely my bad then. I guess the pubs and go-go girls threw me off. Oops. 

+2: The spa tub: Super romantic and relaxing!

-1: Cleanliness: The rooms weren't filthy by any means. Everything you used, or could see, was clean. However, once we pulled the pillows off of the dresser, dust flew everywhere. Pretty ick. The wall paper was also peeling and dingy. 

+2: The gym: Their gym was conveniently located and nicer than I'd expect to find in a Vegas hotel. They even had complimentary purified water and towels. Sadly, I was too hungover or drunk to use it after the first day.

-1: The neighbors: By far the worst part of my stay. I guess it's not the hotel's fault and they really did try to help. But knowing the clientele this place attracts made the decision to never stay here again an easy one. 

The first night we had a room (with a connecting door) next to a family with a brat (yes, I know. I should have considered their poorly chosen arcade and coaster idea). The brat cried and the parents constantly yelled at it. We moved to another room. Not as nice but quiet... until the next morning. A group of German guys moved in. They brought their own sound system and cranked the European techno full blast, bass pumping. They even used our adjoining wall as a drum for emphasis. Maybe they wanted to let us know which tunes they liked best? The entire floor was serenaded with lovely Euro tech which saved us the trouble of complaining - someone else quickly beat us to it. 

-2: The view. Each room we had a view of the back of other hotels or buildings. At least the second room had a view of the mountains, but the windows were really tiny. 

Total: One star wonder. I would never stay here again. Ever. But they weren't 100% heinous.",3,1,0

The only thing i can deduce is that they just don't travel much and have nothing to compare it to.  I stay in a lot of hotels and motels, and other than the Motel 6 I stayed in in the early 80's, I have never stayed in one I disliked more. And I have stayed in all levels of hotels and motels  (5 Star diamond resorts to little roadside motels like Sleep Inn) so I have a pretty good base to compare this to.

For starters, the rooms are dirty and the furniture and carpet is old and dirty.  They have no microwaves, or mini fridges,or even a coffee maker!  The rooms are smaller than the little Econolodge I stayed in in Houston. The tubs have a very high side you have to hang onto something and step over to get in to shower, there is no dresser to lay things on, the beds have indentations in them and I felt like I was sleeping in a hole against the side of something.  You do get a free paper, but you have to go to the gift shop across the lobby to get it.  I worked in my room one day until about 12:30 (noonish).  The housekeepers were cleaning the room next to mine. When I returned that night, they had never come in. Used towels were in the bathroom floor in the pile I'd left them, the bed was unmade, the trash had not been taken out.   When I called to ask if they supplied coffee makers on request, the answer was no.  Basically, they will use any means to lure you to the lobby where all the slots are because they think you are weak and will start playing.  That's an insult to my intelligence. I did not spend one dime in that hotel, other than the room cost. I was there for a company conference they booked and paid for, so I had no choice, but I will NEVER stay at that hotel again!!

The only thing I dislike is their location. The hotel is a bit more South than the hotels I usually stay at, and that means further distance from hotels such as Bellagio and Caesar's Palace. For a more centralized location on the Strip, you're better off staying at Paris or Planet Hollywood.

As far as dining options, NYNY has everything from quick bites like Nathan's hot dogs to an upscale restaurant like Gallagher's Steakhouse. We had a $35 dining credit and used it at their Irish pub, Nine Fine Irishmen. Pretty much ate for (almost) free. Overall, can't beat this hotel for the value. I had a free night from myVegas, got the other two nights from an Expedia deal, so I stayed for three nights for under $200, that's including resort fee. I'm definitely coming back!",2,1,1

Room was good, shower was excellent.  Room was clean throughout.  Nice tile floors and great amenities.  I do wish they offered a mini fridge in every room.

On top of that, the front desk accidentally charged me twice for my room..
I caught the first one when I was checking out. They refunded me for the first one, then I realized they charged me again once I got back to my hometown.

I'm glad I went with NYNY. 

The hotel itself is not as massive as some of the other resorts we visited (MGM, Caesars, Bellagio,) so you don't feel like you're walking for days between your room and the exits or somewhere else in the hotel. The staff at check-in was fantastic and accommodating -- we had asked for a room near an elevator and while she tried to up sell us to an upper floor for $50, we stayed on the 3rd floor, about four doors down from the lifts. Also, I had a fabulous chat with the ladies at the MLife desk (I wish I could remember their names... One was from NC!) and felt very much at home at NYNY. 

While is isn't much in the way of shopping, the restaurants are superb and I recommend hitting up a slice of NYC-style pizza on the cobblestone streets for $4 (or $7 with a drink). Plus, at night you can listen and dance in the street to the piano bar through the open windows.

I had stayed here before and its a decent hotel. If your looking to party the night away and sleeping is just a second thought, then this is an excellent hotel. Right in the middle of action on the south side of the strip and now close to the Aria and Vdara, its a pretty good choice. I ended up getting the rooms for about 40 a night which is excellent! The beds are comfortable and the rooms are fairly spacious.

If you are looking for a hotel where you are cruise around or take advantage of some of the amenities, this might not be the place for you. No buffet =(, the pool area is very weak, the show Zumanity is adult in nature so its with your significant other only, and the food places are mostly quick stop places (only good place is Nine Fine Irishmen, but even that is heavily geared towards mostly drinking. After all your in an ""Irish Pub"").

In think in the end, it really depends on what you are looking for.

This review is based off my stay for 5 nights at the end of March 2017. 

I normally stay here on longer visits because the rooms are priced reasonable and they are decent size. However, here are the problems I had on the most recent stay. 

- Below the window (view of Las Vegas strip) there was mold on the wall, where the wall paper had been pealed back and ripped off. 

- When we went to use the blow dryer in the bathroom for the first time, the whole system came off the wall. The screws they used went into nothing but the sheet rock and they didn't use the proper wall anchors. 

- The drain in the shower was very very slow. Would be standing in water that covered the top of the foot by the end of the shower.

- The bed only had 2 pillows, with no spares in the room. Had to call to ask for more pillows. 

- Sports book is the tiniest I have ever seen. 

- The TBS channel in the room was HORRIBLE. Couldn't watch the basketball games (NCAA tournament - March Madness) games on the channel it was that bad. 

- The MLife card is very inconsistent at locations. Some restaurants will take the card and add the points, some make you take the receipt to the MLife counter to have the points added, in which you can wait in line for 30 minutes depending on how busy. 

- If I am already paying a daily resort fee of $30 I believe, why do I have to pay more to use the sauna in the workout facility?? They wanted $15 more to use that...

I really like the places to eat inside, the atmosphere inside (minus the cigarette smoke all over) but I don't know if I would stay here again. 

I had mentioned to someone at the front desk about the mold below the window, I don't even know if they did anything about it. They didn't offer to move us to another room or anything either!",11,3,1

Anyways, we checked in, walked to our room, and I have to say, NYNY really improved and modernized everything, which was nice. 
   One day we decided to go to the pool, the weather was perfect and what was a better way to cure a hangover  than being at the pool and absorbing some sun? .. Turns out it was under construction... Maybe I'm being prissy, but I felt enraged.
   Our check-out experience was horrible. This woman, charged us for the full resort fee and we argued that we shouldn't pay the full fee because the pool wasn't available. She then tried to explain to us that they mentioned it when we checked in and also mentioned that we can use the pool in certain hotels. They assumed, but in fact they did not tell us this during check in time. She was arguing that they did. She didn't even give us a discount on this stupid resort fee. We didn't want to waste our time, so we left. 1 star deducted for the pool, 1 star deducted for bad customer service, and 1 star deducted for hiring this lady.

I mean who doesn't love Piano Man several times in one evening..they also have video poker right on the edge of the Bar so I can people watch , play poker and have a nice lemon drop ...it's a win all the way around.
They also have a food court that has great extended hours,  and they have a  Haagen Daas  just in case I have an ice cream emergency. The Food Court had a Pastry area that had really decent  tarts which I felt I needed to sample.

This item came out luke warm and the beans and rice arrived on another plate.

The rice and beans were only luke warm and only about 5 bites of rice and 5 bites of beans, no cheese!
The tortillas were luke warm...the service waiter was very good and attentive. no chips and salsa were served and chips and salsa have to be ordered as an extra cost.....most mexican restaurants will serve chips and salsa before you order......

The chandeliers above the eating area need to be cleaned or shaved , they look hairy from dust and lint. Gross!

******************Security Warning ***************

I was a guest at this hotel for five days. during this time period I stayed in the same room and at my request refused any type of room service or maid service.

I had brought a pair of mini canon binoculars into the room, upon check out the binoculars were gone, I realized this a few hours or less after I left when I needed the binoculars for sight seeing at Red Rock.

I contacted the hotel house keeping, short version, the maid said she had not seen them. A security report was filed and this is under investigation. It's hard to believe they had not been located , there's a possibility that someone used a room key during tbe week I was there unbeknownst to me.. The only people in the room was my wife and I and the cleaning staff, who cleaned the room one time right after we left. We had refused room service the entire week. I really hadn't seen the binoculars for about three days but wasn't looking for them either, when we checked out they were just out of sight out of mind. I didn't realize they were missing for a few hours after check out. Update will follow upon conclusion of the hotel security investigation. Just be mindful of these circumstances. I was sloppy for not having a good inventory of my stuff when I packed.

08-27-14
Update Conclusion

Hotel completed their investigation, nothing to support my claim other then my statement. Through their own follow up and interviews and checking electronic records of my room lock they feel the theft is unsubstantiated.  Bottom line I arrived at the hotel with the binoculars and somehow they were stolen from my room during my absence . They just didn't vanish into thin air...no compensation offered for replacement                                                                              ( WHICH I DIDN'T EXPECT ) and they closed their case.....I won't be staying here again for obvious reasons. Take the information for what it's worth.........

This trip, I was kind of surprised that there were not a great deal of changes. The hotel rooms have little to no outlets, to charge your electronic devices. Each bed has only 2 pillows, whereas today's chains usually have 4 pillows to a bed. You pay extra for a pillow-top mattress, but they aren't any more comfortable than the regular ones. There are no mini fridges either. One thing going to them, is they have a safe. While napping in my room, with a do not disturb sign on the door, housekeeping unlocked my door and entered without knocking. They saw me and left. When I went to see what they wanted, all they could say was ""room check"". Checking on what? They had already cleaned the room much earlier. I do like that the hotel has numerous restaurants, from quick counter service to fine dining, as well as a couple bars. They also have more than a few shops. Taxi service is quick to obtain.

Decent location on the strip. I did not realize how big this place was- it's massive. The casino is great but the drink girls were a bit inattentive during the day\/evening (although at night they came out in full force). Casino was decently clean and did not smell like smoke, despite people smoking at the games (it's gotta be something they pump into the rooms).

1) The hotel rooms are hit or miss. Sometimes, I get a great room that is extremely comfortable and very clean. Other times, I have to ask for another room because the room isn't clean or there is a problem with the plumbing or air conditioner. 

2) It is so difficult to fine cocktail servers on the casino floor. I've taken to going and buying a bottle of booze and just taking my flask with me so I don't have to rely on a server. That's kind of sad given that I know the casino wants me sitting in one spot with money to burn.

3) The casino is small in comparison to other casinos around it. MGM and Monte Carlo, for example, are both massive. Mandalay Bay is not too far, and it is huge. New York, New York could stand to do some improvements in the casino, move out some of the overpriced restaurants, and turn that area into some more casino space

Those things said, I do like the fact that there is an arcade and coaster in the hotel. Keep in mind that the coaster is expensive to ride.

Pros: Very clean and spacious room. The bathroom was nice size and all of the furnishings were updated and clean. The bed was really really comfy. I don't know why someone else complained about the roller coaster noise because it doesn't open until 11am and closes at like 9pm. If you're going to bed before 9pm, why are you in Vegas? The casino is nice; just your basic MGM casino layout. 
Cons: It is not easy to get to. Seriously. Not fun. Even walking was not that great. We went for a bite over at Planet Hollywood and it seemed like it took forever to walk there and back because of traffic and the placement of the hotel. Perhaps that's why I prefer off the strip hotels. I can always just drive up somewhere and get valet. The check in staff were pleasant enough, even if for some reason none of the express checkouts were actually working, which made for a longer check out.
But overall, it was a nice stay. I like the hotel, just not a fan of where it's located on the strip and the streets getting to it. Of course that also could be because of construction going on nearby. Hopefully this will get better.",0,0,0

Was able to book a package through Southwest that gave us free tickets to Cirque shows as a bonus. We received an upgraded Park Ave room and it was huge and lovely. The beds are very comfortable and we loved the funny packaging on the toiletries provided. Our bathtub drain was ridiculously slow, but otherwise everything was great.

I would recommend checking out the room-service menu. We browsed through it the first night we were in and found that their specials (and meals in general) are very reasonably priced. We got a huge slab of prime rib, that came with veggies, potatoes, buns, and a side salad, an entree salad, and a plate of nachos all for $50. There was more than enough food to feed the four people we had staying in the room, plus leftovers. And the menu is fairly similar to the 'America' restaurant down in the casino.

There is a wide variety of gaming options in the casino, plus food and bars to keep you entertained. Note that the Zumanity box office is the only one that sells day-of tickets in the afternoon and can usually give you a better price than the other ticket retailers. Watch for the Rok reps walking around the bar as they'll give you wristbands to get in free and there is free champagne for ladies from 11-midnight. There is always a giant line for Coyote Ugly but if you're a lady and are with all girls, head up to the front of the line as they'll let you right in. Guys, befriend girls as this will be your ticket to avoid the lineup. 

I would definitely stay here again as the walk to the center of the strip isn't too long and the hotel has everything you could need. We had a fabulous time and really enjoyed all of the subtle signs mocking NY\/NJ.",2,0,0

The Merriweather fight was on the weekend we went so we didn't get our first, second, or third hotel choice. We went with NYNY since we'd never stayed here and it looks cool.

First, the parking was fine. It was quite a long walk from the garage down the elevators, through the midway, down the escalators, then to registration...but at least we weren't carrying lots of bags (insert sarcastic mark)

The trouble began once we started dining. We had breakfast on Saturday at Il Fornaio (delicious!)...then when we tried to charge the meal to our room I was told (very politely, btw) that I wasn't authorized to room charge. I informed the waiter that I was on the room and also authorized, so he talked to his manager and it was fine.

Nine Fine Irishmen, no problem. Then we go to the pool (they don't allow outside beverages - ridiculous) and get a couple of drinks. I'm told I can't charge to the room (again). Repeat earlier experience, except this time the incredibly rude pool bartender doesn't call his manager or the front desk and simply says NO. Ok fine. Here are the drinks back that you already poured, except you have to waste them. Definitely better than getting money for them (insert another sarcastic mark).

We call the front desk and ask what's going on as we can use the room charge sometimes and sometimes not. They say that I am on the room charge, but whomever is running the bill has to call the front desk for authorization. Sounds like a broken system to me.

The cherry on top was checkout. We go to checkout, and the rooms, room charges, etc. are all on the bill. My dad argues with the supposed casino host for about 15 minutes (reading off of printed email confirmations of offers of free room and food) and only gets 2\/3 off of the bill.

Overall, the good was good, but the bad was so bad. The people we encountered (except the pool bartender and casino host on the phone) were actually really cool people - you could tell they were hamstrung by the suits upstairs and actually cared about the customer (they were the only reason I didn't leave one star). Their system is so messed up that if you were less aware, you'd think the faces you see incompetent, but in actuality, they are in dire need of a system overhaul.

The rooms were large and quite fairly clean. They had all the amenities you could possibly require. My only complaint about our room was the serious lack of a view. We large windows on the corner of the building...and only really had a view of a portion of the roof and the roller coaster. Not the end of the world, but...mundane. 

Because of the price it seems this hotel attracts a moderately sloppy crowd. There will be no shortage of overweight white people in flamboyantly colored track suits playing the slots. 

I liked that the interior lobby was designed to look like you were in the middle of downtown new york, however, the architect would have been better served designing some window seating or something.

Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move.  Got it? OK, let's proceed...

Review #6:
spoiler alert: it is themed after New York City!; some very cool features including the outdoor faux Brooklyn Bridge along Las Vegas Blvd., the outdoor roller coaster that actually runs right above areas of the casino, and the Greenwich Village area of low key eateries; the hotel check-in is not impressive, basically part of the casino; the entry to the roller coaster is via a huge maze of arcade games - great area for the kiddos, I suppose, but Hades for childless adults; serene & classy conference room area on 2nd floor with cool black & white NYC photos; I must say that Nine Fine Irishmen is the greatest Irish pub west of Manhattan, especially with the house band Sin e Ri Ra kicking it almost every night; best craft beer bet = Pour 24 on the 2nd level has a great selection on tap (please stop ordering Bud Light here, people!), and the Broadway Burger Bar has a fair bit as well",2,0,0

Initially, I was told via the phone operator that I was unable to make a booking due to the fact I had just used an offer at Aria. However, she double checked her accuracy and confirmed that she could make a three night complimentary reservation for me. I arrived at the hotel and due to an event earlier in the day, I did not have a credit card to make the reservation at check in (entirely my fault). I spoke with a front desk agent who informed me that if I was unable to check in on the 25th that he would leave a note in the system moving my reservation forward to 26th-29th...great! As it turned out I was unable to come up with the necessary deposit until 8am the next morning when a friend (M Life Platinum member) laid down the cash and checked in with me. At this point we were told the reservation was cancelled and we couldn't check in due to the fact that I had just used an offer at Aria....at this stage I'm starting to realize NYNY Hotel and Casino has serious communication problems. The lady in VIP services who was phoned by the front desk agent didn't even bother to read the notes that had been logged in the previous night stating that should I not check in the reservation would be moved forward. I instructed her to read all the notes and she then realized her error and proceeded to confirm the reservation. However, without telling me, she instructed the front desk agent to make the reservation from 25th-28th against the instructions in the notes. Furthermore, I was told so many different deposit amounts for check in that I became confused as to how much was required. One time it was $367; another time $300...finally my friend put down $200 cash and they gave us a room after a 30 minute process early on a Saturday morning. 

My buddy who put the cash deposit down had to suddenly depart Las Vegas Saturday evening and wanted his $200 so we went to the front desk and explained the situation and they eventually refunded his deposit. HOWEVER, they didn't explain initially that is was contingent on the room being cancelled until I provided another deposit. I informed the front desk agents that another friend would be arriving within the hour to provide a credit card. At this point the agent said as a courtesy the hotel would allow me a one-time entry into my room and provided a key which would work only once to allow me to grab a few belongings and freshen up. I grabbed the key and took the elevator up to my room and, of course, the key didn't open the door. I returned back to the lobby and explained to the male agent, Robert, who programmed the key, that it didn't work. He went and spoke to the assistant manager, Michelle (unprofessional and horrific communicator), who then came over and said I couldn't access my room because they needed a deposit and that she was unaware I had already been in the room!! WHAT?!?! As a manager, how could she not have looked at my folio and made this mistake. Poor poor poor service NYNY. She wouldn't allow me to access my room to grab a few items. So I waited another half hour...keep in mind this past encounter took at least 30 minutes by the time I was told no!!!

I waited and decided to speak with another manager, Jackie, who was even more unprofessional than the assistant manager. Jackie told me that the only reason I got in the room was because I paid a deposit (is she serious?). Anyway, she gave me a bunch of dud excuses about why they made a mistake and miscommunication on their behalf. Finally, I left in disgust and simply said their service was deplorable. 

My friend arrived an hour later with his credit card and I was able to access my room. I am going to be a nightmare to deal with until the end of my stay as I felt the disrespect they showed me was unlike anything I have ever experienced. 

The two female managers that worked that shift on Saturday January 26 were the worst example of customer service I have seen in the US. Vegas and MGM International most certainly pride themselves on exemplary hospitality and these ladies were not trying to find solutions but rather defending their mistakes. 

If you have other options for a hotel, explore them. Numerous other guests were complaining about the service that day as well.",5,1,1

This has to be by far the worst run hotel Vegas has to offer. The customer service experience leaves much to be desired. In fact, I'm surprised the employee name tags don't just say ""give us your money! screw you!"". Reserved a king bed for my husband and I- we are newly weds, however we showed up to a room with two double beds (which they swore were Queen. They're not.) and then was told a room with a King bed would cost extra. We tried to quickly redeem our vacation by going to the roller coaster which is just a maze of meandering employees who don't know where the line begins (they looked blankly and shrugged). Additionally, that whole area where the ticket booth, lockers, & gift shop are located- is a crowded mess of people sitting, standing around, waiting in lines, and there is zero signage up helping direct where to go. We ended up paying for a locker, not going on the ride, and leaving disappointed. As a young woman with a chronic illness, I can assure everyone this is only a place for a young healthy and able-bodied person who isn't phased by demeaning comments slung by staff. I ended up asking an employee if I could speak with a manager, waiting and waiting and waiting and finally just saying ""nevermind"" before heading back to my room. Glad I'm heading to the Golden Nugget tomorrow. Would never step foot in here again and will make sure no one I know for as long as I live ever visits this establishment.

There are a lot of cheap food choices here, but my fav was 9 Fine Irishmen. Irish pub with decent food, good beers, and excellent service. The waitresses' uniforms did not hurt either. Ben & Jerry's was convenient and great as always. Il Fornaio and America were decent, but better food could be had by walking to MGM or Monte Carlo. The only breakfast buffet was at Chin Chin, with an Asian twist.

NYNY was all over location. It's centered in the south strip, across the street from MGM and next door to Monte Carlo. Excalibur is across the street, but I only used it to pass through to Luxor and Mandalay Bay.

Next time I will definitely skip the spa services at NYNY. Their spa is small and overpriced for the amenities. Also, the guy on the men's side was kind of rude.",0,0,0

How are you expected to get on the elevator, past reception, with that giant slot machine staring at you...laughing in your face because it knows it's going to take all of your money. 

True story folks. It all started when I put $20 in this machine. First few pulls and I'm down. Next few pulls and I'm up. Up, down, up, down, up. Now I'm exhausted and have a crowd around me as I've been here for about 20 minutes (I'm sure people were just gathering because they were fed up with me not sharing the machine). I am heaving and hawing, yanking on that machine over and over. Every time I got back to  the original $20 I had put in I told myself I was going to leave, but I never did. 

Downward spiral. In a matter of minutes went from $47 to $1. I took my last $1 pull and gone, the money is gone. I share a moment with the machine, pulling my face close to it...more like using it to cover the tears gathering in my eyes. I take a moment, step back and take a breath. No longer than a minute and someone else has already taken my place. $1 in. 

DING, DING, DING, DING. $1, 1 pull, jackpot of $4,793.54. For realzies?

Things to remember:
1. That was a true story
2. You can't ask someone for a cut of their winnings, even if it was you who had just dumped an endless bucket of cash in the machine for over 20 minutes. It doesn't go over very well. 
3. Don't go in March because the pool is closed (I learned that the hard way)
4. Nice accommodations, good value.

At 6:45am the morning after we checked in a strange man walked into our room, using a key & turned on the lights. We are two ladies passed out after a long day of getting to Vegas & had the hell scared out of us. Probably scared him, too. 

I call to front desk, obviously very upset & confused and she tries blaming it on me saying it either didn't happen or we must have left our door open & he randomly walked in!!! She checks the computer saying no other keys have been made for our room & insists it was our fault. Then she suddenly puts me on hold for 5 minutes because he came back down to the front desk saying exactly what I said. 

She offers no apologies, no making it up to us, just says it rarely happens & we can get a new key programmed. Like that makes a difference. Wow. When I ask to speak to a manager, she says she is one. When we ask for a room she says we have to wait until 9am to see if there is anything available. I ask if she'll be on at that time and no...

It was our first time in Vegas, and a friend recommended the New York New York, and I am so glad she did.  We stayed there for two nights - Saturday and Sunday night.  I thought it was very affordable.  We used an entertainment book coupon to save a little on the price (10%, I think).  I booked online and called to confirm my room a few days later. 

This hotel met, and exceeded, all of my hotel requirements - clean, quiet and comfortable.  The room even had black out curtains.  When we woke up at 10am my husband and I literally thought it was the middle of the night.  It was wonderful. 

Every employee we encountered at the hotel was kind, friendly, and helpful.  I truly enjoyed staying there.  As I typically do in hotels, we just hang the do not disturb sign up, and we don't have housekeeping come into our room - we ran into them in the hallway and got some fresh towels.  

We stayed in a king sized nonsmoking room, which was exactly what we had requested.  We were even able to check in early at 1pm for no extra fee, and when we arrived before that time the early check in process was explained to us, and it all went smoothly.  We arrived on an early morning flight, so they held our luggage at the bell desk (efficient and friendly service) while we checked out some casinos before our room was ready.  

We stayed on the 29th floor of the Century Tower and had an amazing view of the back side of the strip, the mountains around the city, and the Rio.  

During the day I sometimes heard people talking while we were in our room, but we slept straight through the night and into the late morning without hearing anything (which I can rarely say about a hotel).  We kept our AC fan on medium speed, and that kept our room nice and cool, and possibly covered up any background noise if such a thing existed. 

Everything was efficient at this hotel - luggage drop, luggage pick up, check in, check out...and they have plenty of employees available to answer your questions with a smile.  We enjoyed the casino.  It's big, but not too big.  There are also lots of affordable food options in the lobby area by the casino - pizza by the slice, and a deli.

I checked out the roller coaster on top of the casino with our two for one deal that we got since we stayed at the hotel, and it was a lot of fun - and we did not have to wait in a line to ride.

I see that many of the reviews complain about the hotel not living up to the city of new york.  And all I can say is DUH!  It's a THEME for crying out loud.  :) Do you expect to feel like you're on a pirate ship when you're at Treasure Island, or like you're in ancient Egypt when you're at Luxor?  They did put a lot of effort into detail though..  You do get that ""gritty, hardcore"" new york feeling to a much larger degree than anywhere else on the strip.....despite the fact that a large percentage of the people here are weekender transplants from LA.  

What I find funniest of all is that the most ""new yorkish"" thing of all is the lines that you'll run across in the food establishments in the ""village"".  The lines are all VERY slow moving and long...just like new york.   I swear, they must've went to new york to hire these people too... because most of them seem to have everything from the accent to the look of typical new yorkers.  

The room - The room is a pretty standard room.  You get what you pay for.  You're not going to get the posh opulence of the Bellagio....but it won't be a bargain basement slummy place like Hooters.  I did have a problem with a safety pin being on the floor upon my arrival.  (Must've been missed by the cleaning people, I almost stepped on it barefoot.. ouch), and one morning there was a problem with water temperature.  (Might have been a fluke as it was better later on in the evening, and the following morning).  Other than that, I have no problems at all with the room. 

It's a nice middle of the road hotel.  For 10bucks a night they upgraded me to a strip view, which has an excellent view!  The location is in a perfect spot on the strip.  It's within easy walking distance to the heart of it all.  Also, you're just a hop away from both the Monorail AND the Mandalay Tram.  There's a pharmacy within easy walking distance if you want to pick up essentials like mouthwash, bottled water, (condoms) etc...without paying the overpriced strip prices.

GREAT! We left Excalibur (see my review) and came here based on the recommendation of a buddy. Fantastic recommendation. Within five minutes of sitting down on the slots the drinks started flowing. I got fairly drunk and dumped quite a bit of money into the slot machines here. Funny how that works isn't it?

There were half naked dancing women behind the poker tables, great way for the house to win LOL. All in all, we will definitely be back, and may never wonder anywhere else on the strip. New York-New York is about the best we found in our walk of the strip.",0,0,0

I have to say, as we slowly entered into the hotel, I did not expect to see what I was about to see. I did not know there is a mini New York INSIDE the New York-inspired buildings themselves. The whole entire food court is based off of the infamous streets of New York. You can see mini ny apartments, along with the iconic ny food served there in mini restaurants. I started r frolicking around like a little kid in the candy store. NyNy's food court is so cleverly designed that we rarely ate elsewhere. 

Now, to the room. As we reached our room number, we heard muffled music. Weird. After a few tries with the card, we got into the room. Lo and behold, the blaring music came from the radio in the room. The room keeper must have knew we were coming to party our asses off as that is the only explanation I can come up with that explains why she left the radio on (with volume allll the way up). Needless to say, our little dance parties took off right away. 

The room was very spacious and nicely decorated. I have nothing to complain about except for one thing: there was no vent in the bathroom. So with no windows and no vent, one may wonder how to do their daily deeds (deeds that don't smell too great) without everyone else knowing AND smelling it. Yea, it was definitely tough......

Check-in was fairly smooth; May 26-29, and our room in Century Tower B on the 33rd floor had a nice view of the T-Mobile Arena and neighboring Monte Carlo Resort for our 4 night stay. But even at check-out, no one could tell me what the incessant noise was that sounded like machinery; or a train; or even the roller coaster, almost non-stop day and night. I know the coaster doesn't run throughout the night, and from our room the track looked to be maybe 10 floors below our window. And the only sound from the coaster, was the screams heard from riders during its descent down the drop, seen from our room #3337. 

The bed mattress was firm but quite comfortable, but the pillows are some of the most uncomfortable I've experienced anywhere, and you're not given a choice of two, only one each.

The restaurants were for the most part quite decent, minus my experience at Il Fornaio Cucina Italiana Bakery. Which I found to be below average. I confused this bakery with the restaurant, which we did not dine at, so disregard my check-in and tip of that establishment.

Staff, for the most part, were quite helpful but at check-out, the desk clerk tried to charge me $20.00 for our use of the complimentary drinks we had on our tab. Apparently my wife's bartender at the pool when ordering her virgin mixed pina colada\/lemonade drink, and Starbuck's barista, my Frappuccino and son's coffee, entered these orders as food not drinks. Fortunately my wife arrived with my frap in hand, and the receipt from Starbucks, just as the clerk was heading off to his manager to get the charges dropped. Sure, it's only $20.00, but you awarded me the complimentary $25.00 drinks card at check-in, don't now try to charge me for its use. And train your staff the difference between food and drink items when inputting them into the register. He was eventually given the okay from the manager to drop those charges.

We stayed at Bally's so our experience at New York New York felt like a breath of fresh air, literally. Our friends were staying in a suite here so we met up with them and I have to say that I was really surprised. First off, it smelled delicious throughout the hotel and casino. They are certainly pumping extra oxygen into the casino and they must have a thousand glade plug in's because it was refreshing and not as smokey as other casinos. On Saturday night it was a party in there as well. The casino was blasting great music, every table was full, slots were being used all over. My friend's insisted on finding the $5 blackjack tables (really?!) and of course the two they had were full of college kids and had crowds of people around them. We finally got in and it was pretty fun. We also had a chance to hang out at the pool for a bit on Saturday afternoon and it was a lot of fun there. The pool seating area was not too large, but the pool itself was a good size. We had to roam around for a while until we found the perfect seats right next to the pool. They have those fun chairs in the pool which were cool because you get to sit in the water without having to actually get INTO the pool. Lots of people at the pool but not overwhelming at all. There were fun games of water polo happening and the people watching was priceless! We got a few margaritas, they were stiff and delicious. The restaurants area was very lively and fun. My friends ate at Gonzales y Gonzales and the food looked good and they said it was delicious. And finally, we didn't stay the night there but we hung out in their suite on the 17th floor. I have to say that I have seen better suites for SURE! The decor was pretty bland, nothing special. Two small single person chair\/sofas and a small table. They also had a really ugly looking Jacuzzi in the middle of their room which was fun for them but awkward looking aesthetically speaking. Also, the walk to their room was literally over 10 minutes from the casino elevators. Once on the 17th floor it was a windy trek all the way to the room. That would have been an inconvenience for me if I was staying there. And here's something alarming to me. My friend and her bf are heavy smokers and when they got to their room, they realized it was a non-smoking room. After they called the front desk, they told her that they didn't have any more smoking rooms like she had reserved so they could go ahead and smoke in the room anyway. As someone who deals with bad allergies, it would suck to check into a non-smoking room and have to deal because the couple who stayed for a whole week before me were allowed to smoke over a pack a day in that room.",2,0,1

I go every year because of the Strip at Night half marathon. This past weekend, my husband and I decided to upgrade the room to a players suite for more square footage and just to be comfortable. We enjoyed the two tv's and my girlfriend and I enjoyed foot soaks in the jetted tub that is in the room.

I'm inspired to write this review because we mainly stayed here and got to pretend we were living in a New york apartment. Go downstairs for breakfast (grab a cronut at the America place, or breakfast samich at the italian bakery) or heading down to go to a show or grab lunch. I like choices. While there is no buffet (we walked to Cosmo for Wicked Spoon which is amazing!) I did like the diversity of quick eateries that were available.

The one thing I would stay away from is the Cell phone accessories place located on the Mezzanine level. That guy is a total con artist. My phone charger broke (it's a cord I bought at the swap meet) and since I was only there for one more night I didn't intend on bothering to charge my phone. I passed by it and specifically asked if the item in my hand was the cheapest iphone 5 charger. He said $24 and then proceeded to try to sell me a phone case that included a charger. I asked if that one was cheaper than $24 and his reply was it's $99. Did you NOT just hear what I was asking you. When I stepped away to leave he tried to pull me back in and say he would sell the first one to me for $20. When I asked what time he would open til (because I still wasn't justified in $20 purchase for just 12 more hours til I got home) he said ""I won't be open later for you, after you leave, I'm closed"". That was the last straw.

I was very skeptical of this hotel due to the type of clientele that some of the attractions entice. (Coyote Ugly, ESPN Zone, Arcade area on 2nd floor, Mediocre restaurants) but after a lot of research (on Yelp and other sites), we decided to give it a try. 

Luckily due to the crappy economy, there are a LOT of hotels offering killer rates, especially for the Sunday - Thursday crowd. NYNY was offering free upgrades to the Spa Suite including a bunch of coupons for drinks, food, and BOGOs. Also, the Spa at NYNY was offering a deal: 2 50 minute treatments for $170 which is about $70 off of the regular price. ALSO, Zumanity tickets were 40% off. Signs pointed to stay at NYNY this trip and give them a shot. 

Check in was a breeze. Arriving on Sunday is great. No crowd at all at the front desk. We got our keys, went to our elevator which was very close to the front desk, and went to our room. 

We walked in and it was BIG! Huge picture windows overlooking the pool and 1st drop of the roller coaster, Big flat screen on the wall, Huge Kingsized bed with footside bench, Roomy bathroom with walk in shower and big shower head, and the coup de grace, the elegant Hot tub for 2 with all kinds of mirrors surrounding it. Lots of stuff in one room but there was still enough room to run around, do cartwheels, whatever you fancy. It really is a nice room with modern decor and a lot of space. Too much space almost. It seemed like a chore to walk all the way to the front to answer the door for the bellhop who brought our bags up, but I complain in sheer jest. 

First order of business? Test that hot tub out! It had one of those cascading water spouts that pour into the tub. After about 10 minutes, I finally realized that it wasn't filling up and I had to close the drain. Duh. It took around 20 minutes to fill and we were ready to dive in. We actually took a shower first because we didn't want to soak in dirty water. Must be the Japanese in us. Once in, it was nice. 2 little seats to enjoy the jets. Very very very nice way to start our vacation. Also, you would think that it would get a little musty in the room that has a hot tub in it, but the venting system was very good and it didn't stink at all. Good job to the engineer for that job! 

We decided to get a drink at Pour 24 because they boasted a large beer tap inventory. 24 I presumed. We sat at the bar and got 16 oz pours of Moosedrool Brown Ale and Abita Purple Haze. Both were very good beers. We also had the Rogue Stout and the Blue Moon Honey Wheat. All were good and will be reviewed more deeply in Pour 24's dedicated Yelp. :) 

After getting a good buzz, we decided to go pick up our tickets for Zumanity at Will Call and also make reservations for dinner at Gallagher's. We didn't want to walk outside the hotel for the night and Gallagher's was the best option for this hotel. Both Gallagher's and Zumanity will be reviewed separately as well. Good for both though. 

Next day was our Spa treatments in the morning. Great experience. Review to follow as well. Same goes for the pool. Not huge but a great atmosphere. Perfectly crowded on a Monday afternoon. 

After a great dinner at L'Atelier at MGM (highly recommended) we came back to some leisurely gambling at NYNY. They have a good assortment of everything for every budget. I stayed in the high roller area just to kill time (yeah right) We headed up to the arcade area to check it out. Wow, still a bunch of loud and obnoxious teenagers running around at 11pm. Bleh. Decided to grab a slice of NY pizza and Nathan's hot dog and head up to the room for the night. Both were delish BTW. 

Check out was a breeze. BTW, everything is payable via room card so you don't need to carry around your wallet except for gambling and such. Great system. No employees acting skeptical as to how to charge the room or anything. Very professional. I didn't meet one employee that I didn't like. 

Like I stated above, NYNY has changed my mind about staying here. I still wouldn't come here if I wasn't staying here, but I would definitely come here to stay. Spa Suite or better only according to the other reviews.",3,0,3

Pluses:
* Front desk upgraded me 2 levels, and the rest of the staff is friendly;
* Room they upgraded me to is pretty big
* Not including room, the place has aged well.  The outside still looks good (it was built back when Vegas was trying to be family-friendly...ha!) and both the outside and casino area have aged well and don't look dated.  However...

Minuses:
* The room is pretty dated.  The fact it was built in the 80s is very clear here.  I think the TV has to be at least 15 years old (it does work well though.  But the channel choices are pretty limited);
* Cleaning staff could do a better job cleaning; I found a bunch of toenail clippings near the bed;
* I worked late so ordered a steak thru room service.  Meh, pretty mediocre, salty and not worth the $26.  (in fairness, the salad I had the next evening was very good);

We had the best service when we were here; either on the floor with the comped drinks, which where not watered down like some other places, or at any one of the bars or restaurants there. We moved around a lot and it seemed that every time we'd stop to gamble, one of the waitresses would come and ask us if we wanted a drink. We never went with out one for long. 

We'd chuckle every time the rollercoaster would come through and you could hear the people on it screaming. It just added to the fun.

Due to family (kids want to go to arcade), was forced to set foot in an MGM Resort properties for the first time in over a year (boycotting due to them charging for parking to squeeze more profits for executive bonuses). Casino has no poker room (my usual game) so went down to the pits for a little blackjack while the kids do their thing. Sat down, bought in for $100 with plans to re-buyin for a couple hundreds more, and gave the dealer my player's card along with the money. Dealer immediately toss the player's card back and condescendingly said 'we don't track at this table'. Wow. Really? $5-25 a hand action is too small for New York-New York\/MGM? I realize everyone love whales but it's the everyday gamblers that keep the lights on for you and prevent your property from looking dead. Everywhere else give you at least token credit for sitting at a table.

Dealer had personalities of zombies - just going through the motion. Nobody was tipping but with that attitude and company policies no wonder nobody tips.

Crappy multi-deck blackjack rules with high house edge. To top it off after giving them $300 in under an hour of play, you still have to give them $$ for parking. 

Awesome experience (sarcasm). No thanks, won't be back. Good job turning a property that I am somewhat neutral on (never played in NY-NY before) to a negative experience. For the couple bucks in parking fee you chased off customers that would drop a couple hundreds in your properties.",6,0,1

Yes, I live in SoCal, but sometimes life and career happen. That aside, seeing the towering, cluster of buildings took my breathe away and he excitement was kind of overwhelming; I'm a 31-year-old man, just two months out of major abdominal surgery. I couldn't have asked for a better place to enjoy 24 hours of just fun, albeit toned down fun, but fun nonetheless. 

After purchasing my room from Expedia and whatnot, I couldn't wait to get there. (Just FYI- date of arrival was 10-22-15 and departure, 10-23-15 AM) I counted down the days and seconds, etc. Valet is quite easy to find and on Tropicana (just a quick U-turn from Tropicana if you're coming from the 15 North). Our valet attendant was incredibly nice and welcomed us to the little bit of the isle of Manhattan on the West Coast. Exciting! It was such a rush waking through those double doors; the smell to me is highly intoxicating and a happy familiar smell that 10 years later feels like you've arrived in Vegas. Awesome sauce! 

We got into the registration queue which took an astounding ...5 minutes to check in. Alfonso, I believe was his name, checked us in quickly. As my room was not a suite, was prepaid via Expedia, no credit card was required as I paid the resort fees in cash. No credit card needed for a hold for incidentals, deposit or anything. (Hope I answered some of the questions about that.)

After we got to our room assignment 2931, Century Tower A or 1, our awesome room on the 29th floor, the first room you come to once exiting was our room. Now, some might find that unappealing as it is so close to the elevator. However, for someone who isn't entirely at their prime (only 2 months out of surgery), it was a godsend. I must also mention, there was zero hallway traffic noise throughout the night. Zero, zilch. 

We ventured to the Lobby Bar which is very quaint, we plumped down to two video poker games, pumped it with a $20, the first drinks of the day began. Cameron, at the Lobby Bar, is quite possibly the nicest, funniest and most accommodating bartender I've ever encountered. The bar was full and people from all parts of the casino wanted drinks from him. As busy as he was, he never faltered in giving each of his patrons the best service with utmost attention. Thank you, Cameron!

If I had one issue, it would be the mLife desk to check-in, sign up or redeem MyVegas app comps. It was about 3:30pm, the line was 25 people deep and only 2 registrars. There is also a separate line for mLife ""high rollers"" that trumps the rest of us who doesn't have all those points. I'd recommend, especially during peek check-in hours, there'd be more folks over there helping us out. I digress from the positive. 

For dinner, I made reservations for my aunt's birthday at Nine Fine Irishmen and the 6 of us gathered there at 5:30. The lovely hostess explained the history and liveliness of the restaurant (my mom's family, which is who attended said dinner, comes from the UK, so we enjoyed it). We are, at times, heifers so we love trying as much as possible. We ordered the fried sausages with those delicious dipping sauces, the Beer Cheese dip with artisan breads and the baked Brie with balsamic marinated cherries; all 3 were unbelievably and insanely good. (Side note: the bartenders are no joke. Every drink that was ordered was delish). Our main entrees were 2 fish & chips, Shepherd's Pie, two Nine Fine Salads and one Bangers & Mash. All was delicious. I'm a trained chef and yes, I stand by these opinions on the food. Our server was very attentive and the expediter was also very nice and attentive. Just an all around great dinner. 

I'm sure I've bored you enough with my review, but we gambled a bit and my traveling companion and I went to the Center Bar for drinks and some gambling. Drinks were fantastic (Cosmopolitan was amazingly cold with little floating chips of ice -- perfection!)

To top it alllll off, after the alcohol seeped in, we decided to order room service. I can't say enough about how great the menu is for us late night eaters who need booze sopped up. We ordered quite a bit (because why not) and were quoted 45 minutes or less; it was there in like 25-30, piping. Very happy!!!

We checked out today, Friday morning and the email to check out was super easy and key drop right in elevator waiting area on first floor. Got our car from valet and off we went back to Los Angeles. 

I cannot thank you all enough at NYNY for making this trip, as short as it was, just so much fun and how happy I was. Thank you thank you thank you. From the bottom of my heart. Thank you.",4,1,2

Hotel:  Our $85 run-of-the-house room for a Sunday night was clean and comfortable. Certainly showing some age, but the shower had good pressure and the bed comfortable. One sign of age was the fact that there are few places to charge cell phones.  Neither of which were convenient. (desk and bathroom, not nightstands)

  Two strong dislikes: 1)  no security!  No security guard at the elevator, and no card needed to access the elevator.  2) The mobile check-in service sucks!  Checked in the day before.  Was asked for an estimated time of arrival.  Well, check-in was 3, so I said 3 (although earlier would have been better).  After filling out all the info (including credit card), I was told to NOT go to the desk UNTIL an email arrived with our room number.

Fast forward to FOUR hours later (7pm) and we still had not gotten said email.  So now we're ticked off and ready to do battle when we decide to risk all and go to the check-in counter.  After a simple ""sorry"" when he heard we had been waiting for four hours, we were given the key to a room via the New Yorker elevators.   Note to NYNY management...we would have spent more time and more dollars IN your hotel had we received the email and been able to check in earlier, instead of killing time and spending dollars nearby.  Just sayin' you might want to revisit this strategy.

Casino:  Hell yeah!  I can't recall another time where I had more fun at blackjack tables!  My rule for playing blackjack is it has to be a fun table with a friendly dealer, and literally every table I hopped around to was exactly so!  Even the pit boss was friendly.  It truly felt like they wanted us to play and have fun.  Which we did for as long as our one night,early morning flight allowed.
Again, too bad we couldn't have checked in earlier and spent more gambling entertainment dollars.

Parking:  It was $12 for the night.  We had problems with the machine to pay on the way out, but they had a help button. Have to check my credit card statement to make sure that worked out okay.",7,3,4

The furniture were mostly paint-chipped with scratch marks. Oh and the kicker of the whole trip was that the king sized bed sagged one ONE side and not the other, so either me or my partner had to deal with back pain the next morning. 

This is seriously the worst room we have ever stayed in in Vegas. Even Tuscany Suites or Southpoint had better rooms.

We asked where the pool was.  She responded that the fitness center was only for 18 and up.  I said ""my son isn't going to the fitness center.  Where is the pool?).

Not a lot of time was spent in the hotel room, but the views at night left amazing memories. 

I was warned by a friend that the roller coaster is noisey but it was actually pretty silent, it was never loud enough to bother or wake us up. The friends we went with were pretty stoked to hear that you can ride the roller coaster for free if you stay at the hotel (i think its about $10 to ride the roller coaster normally).

The beds were really comfortable with super soft sheets. I never sleep good on hotel beds but I actually had a really amazing sleep the nights we were there. The room was always nice and clean, as well as the rest of the hotel. 

As for downstairs, theres a Espn sports club as well as a Coyote Ugly. Dont forget tons among tons of slot machines and card tables, but since its NYNY there are New York facades that have breakfast and lunch foods for pretty reasonable prices.

Pluses:
-Location: right across from MGM for (Wet Republic) and about a 15 min walking distance to Aria (Haze) and Cosmopolitan (Marquee)
-Coyote Ugly, well not sure if this is a complete plus due to the type of ppl who show up here..
-Quite a few quick bite places to eat here when you're on the go: pizza, sandwiches, etc.
-Price is fairly decent, you can probably land a pretty good deal with hotwire.
-Lost and Found is pretty awesome. A friend left her heels at a cafe here one night after a few too many drinks and they kept it in Lost and Found. I was back a few weeks later and was able to pick them up fairly easily.

Deltas:
-Small unexciting pool although easy to find beds to lay on
-Noisy ppl in the hallway, it's like the doors block absolutely no sound.
-The rollercoaster is one of the worst ways to spend your $14.
-Drinks at the bar was unnecessarily $$. A Corona for $8?? I know it's Vegas but goddamn!!
-Ultimately, it's a very meh hotel for Vegas.",2,0,1

Their prices are decent to stay and their rooms are very nice. You don't get all the glitter and glitz that you would like some of the other fancy and classy hotels on the strip but this hotel is still great for a vacation for families that can't stay away from the casinos and still want to have fun for the family. The pool is nice and the ride will keep the kids entertained. The food is great so you can't go wrong if you chose this hotel on your next Vegas vacation.,3,1,2

I was on the end near the Vegas sign more & not in the middle, but I did not mind at all it was still on the strip, right in the action ! 

The room was clean & well decorated as well. Very nice & comfortable. Bed was heaven. I know some people say the rollar coaster was annoying, but the part where they first drop was right outside my window & I only heard it once. It was only a tiny shriek was all & I actually enjoyed seeing people on it haha. The bathroom was also very clean.

I was a bit dissapointed that the pool was only open til 6pm. I would have liked the option of some night swimming & it is strange since most hotels have theirs open later in the night.

The decor of room is so ugly nothing matched the lighting was horrible. We had our neighbor trying to get in our room from the adjoining suite in the middle of the night banging on the door and trying to force door open and then they started fighting and yelling was ridiculous. We had to pay $3 a day for having the phone in room??? Our room was not cleaned the first day somebody put a privacy card on our door so was never cleaned and called for fresh towels took 40 min and the ipod radio was broken the hallways were so dirty and smelly I would NEVER stay here again so much crammed inside casino it is so crazy you just want to take a shower from taking a shower its gross.

There it is, a jumbled pile mock-up of the venerable Manhattan skyline -- the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, the Public Library -- all crammed together, along with the 150-foot Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, all built to approximately one-third scale. And as if that weren't enough, they threw in a roller coaster running around the outside and into the hotel and casino itself.

Inside is a different story these days. Once as highly themed as the outside, the main casino space has gotten a makeover that has removed much of the New York detail. Gone are the Big Apple Bar and Central Park-themed gaming areas, replaced by a sleekly modern decor that while pretty, is nowhere near as entertaining. The replica of Greenwich Village, down to the cobblestones, the manhole covers, the tenement-style buildings, and the graffiti, remains (Yes, they even re-created that!), and you'll still find enough of the Gotham silliness elsewhere to probably evoke a smile or three, but dizzy laughter over the sheer spectacle is a thing of the past.

Upstairs is the arcade, which is Coney Island themed (naturally) and this is where the line for the roller coaster starts. There are many restaurants, all housed in buildings that fit the theme of whatever New York neighborhood is represented in that particular part of the hotel.

Rooms are housed in different towers, each with a New York-inspired name. The place is so massive and mazelike that finding your way to your room can take a while. There are 64 different layouts for the rooms, which have moved them ever farther from the original Deco-inspired decor to something bland, albeit comfortable, and though the bathrooms are small, they are pleasantly decorated. There can be a loooonnnggg walk from the elevators, so if you have ambulatory issues, you had best mention this while booking. Light sleepers should request a room away from the roller coaster. The health club and spa are nice but nothing to write home about and the mediocre pool is right next to the parking structure.

In addition to a particularly good food court and the aforementioned restaurants, there are several festive and beautifully decorated bars and club opportunities plus the topless and adults-only Cirque du Soleil production Zumanity, which we think is improving but not the best that Cirque has to offer.",1,3,1

Ive stayed at alot of the different hotels on the strip and I got to say this place has been added to my list. I was kind of worried since I read different mixed reviews on this place, but they proved all the negativity wrong. 

One thing though...

DO NOT UPGRADE TO BROADWAY!!!

We got a Broadway room the first night  because the guy at the front desk had UPGRADED us....totally disappointed with the room. the decor was bland and the room looked very old. don't be fooled just because it says its bigger.  I was facing the back part of the hotel which is the parking lot.

I called the following morning to change rooms....Very easy process. 
I DOWNGRADED to a PARK AVENUE room. Now this room was nice. very clean. Nicely decorated and a better view of the strip. I was on the 24th floor. 

Beds are comfortable and so are the pillows. The bathroom is like a normal bathroom nothing special...but I honestly don't care...I just need it to do my business and take a shower..

Sound proof walls... I didn't hear any noise when we were in our room. 

The staff was very friendly. 

The location is good. if you don't feel like walking then you can catch the monorail at MGM which is right across the way. 

The roller coaster was cool said the hubby. Check out the schedule you have in your room because there is a 2 for 1 special during a certain time of the day. 

A suggestion though is to bring a cooler of some sort and buy some drinks and water to keep in the room..so you don't have to keep on going downstairs to get  something to drink.

The reason I give it a four star is for the LONGGGGGGGG WALK to my room. I mean seriously...I had to pack water and food just for the walk to the room.lol.

Check in and out has always been quick and friendly.  Look, if you show up to check in right after the AARP tour bus shows up, I don't care what hotel you're at, it's gonna be a wait.

The hotel is not situated in a way that you can get a view of the entire strip unless you're in the penthouse, so I wouldn't pay extra for that.  If your idea of a Vegas vacation is sitting in your room looking at the view, spend the money for the Bellagio.  Otherwise, this is a great place to stay.  Have I stayed in better?

My understanding was that I could receive a bandaid or pay for ems to take me to a hospital. She gave off the impression that my bleeding foot was an inconvenience to her.

To add insult to injury, I was wheeled from a small area to the open casino floor rather than a private room to wait for bleeding to stop. I have attached photos.

We got two free rides on the roller coaster which was way fun!  I'm glad we got to do that but I don't think I would pay $12 for it.

We got 2-for-1 drink coupons for Nine Fine Irish Men, the hotel's Irish bar.  We LOVED this place!  It was a huge, tri-level bar\/restaurant with a nice little outdoor seating area.  We thoroughly enjoyed sitting out there on a few balmy September nights.  The bar somehow manages to remain intimate in spite of its size.  The bartender was friendly and generous, giving us big tastes of a bunch of beers for free because we didn't know what to order.

Also included in the coupons was a 2-for-1 breakfast at the litte Italian restaurant.  Again, we weren't expecting much.  But the breakfast was fabulous!  The best benedict I've had in a long time, for sure.  Plus we got to sit ""outside"" on the ""patio"" next to the ""river"".  

NYNY has a great location in the middle of all the action, which is another plus.

The only downside was the selection of late-night eats.  We ended up settling on slices of pizza that were like cardboard and just NASTY.

Oh, and the pool leaves a little to be desired.  Kind of cramped, and it feels ""walled-in"".

I would certainly stay here again because I don't think you can beat the value.  You're not paying all that much but you actually get a lot of quality.",0,0,0

I went to Vegas for one of my birthdays. It was my first trip to Vegas, I drove from LA and was rather tired. I booked a room beforehand, and wanted a nice one, so I have paid online for the upgrade to a Strip View room. 

What a disappointment it was for me when I have seen that the ""Strip view"" was a view of that part of Strip where nothing was built (it was a few years back). The room itself was OK, just a hotel room. 

When I went down to talk to a receptionist that I really wanted a Strip view (with some view, not empty roads, and not a partial Strip view), and it was my birthday, the receptionist looked at me like I had a disease or something and said nothing. Really, he did not say anything, not I apologize, not an even attempt to make me feel better. So, I was stuck in this room with an ugly view of a desert having paid for it a higher price. 

Could I talk to a manager? Yes, perhaps, but this is the last thing you wanna do when you are in town for two days and want to have fun celebrating your birthday. It already sucked to be there all by myself. And New York New York did not help. 

I guess it might be selective treatment: regular mortal people who don't rent penthouses don't count.

The show is in a pretty small theatre, so even with balcony seats we felt a lot closer than you would at other Cirque du Soleil shows.  The food and drink options were surprisingly limited and very mediocre looking.  As far the show itself, due to the setup and theme of the show it actually isn't quite as acrobatic as the other Cirque shows I've seen, and it is a smaller setup so there is less going on at once, more of a focus on one performer at a time.  But there were still some pretty great performances.  It was definitely pretty risqué stuff, but my wife loved the show, so there ya go.

Ok I'll deal with since I won't be spending a ton of time in the room anyway.  One of things you will come to find out in Vegas is every ATM has the most ludicrous of fees possible.  So to avoid this I always visit the banking center at the cashier to pull large sums of cash out at once.

Once again clearly not the richest dude in Vegas however to me $5000 isn't a small amount of money.  When I visited the cashier not only were they incredibly rude when I asked to get money off my card but they told me that even as a guest of the hotel they would charge a fee of $200 to simply pull the money off my card.

~tons of restaurants and bars and check into the 24 bar and get a free jello shot at the Center bar.   Yea!  Free is good.

Here's the big HOWEVER: 

IF YOU EVER LEAVE YOUR BAGGAGE IN THE HANDS OF THEIR EMPLOYEES OR IN THE BELL HOP AREA, LOCK YOUR BAGS!! 

My boyfriend and I vacationed there May 1-3, and when we checked out, our baggage went to bell hop because our flight wasn't leaving for another 12 hours. 

When we got back home in Honolulu, we found some personal items (brand spanking new!!) MISSING!! 

I called the hotel and TWO weeks later, they are still giving me the run around about how to go about filing this complaint. Initially, they allowed me to file a complaint and i got a report number. Then they said call the RISK MANAGEMENT office (which I don't think exists!!) to follow up. I have called the office EVERY SINGLE day and EVERY SINGLE time it goes to voice mail, saying they are busy or away from the desk. They must be playing all day cause cant get them to answer ONCE. When I brought this up to a manager (about how i cannot get a hold of the RISK MANAGEMENT), they said ""oh, they must be backed up."" WAIT. That's the last thing I want to hear: That they have SO MANY report complaints that they re backed up. WTH. 

So, I call front desk, and i end up talking to several different managers saying they'll get back to me. THEY NEVER DID. I asked to be connected to an actual speaking person from the Risk Management office, and the managers say they cant connect me (How sketchy is this?!) Then just recently, the manager said they don't even have my report number. THAT WAS IT: I'VE HAD IT UP TO **HERE**. 

Its very frustrating because as paying guests, we should get the treatment and respect, and so far, the only thing I've walked away with is that THE ENTIRE CORPORATION DOESN'T CARE. They haven't called me back since, they haven't offered to take care of some of the expenses. 

I wanted to share this HORRIBLE experience over yelp because I don't think anyone else should have to experience this. 

By the way, if you ask to speak to a manager, don't even bother (I'd put their name on here, but I don't do threats). Yeah that's right, I just called you out.",9,4,2

I will say out of all the hotels in Vegas on the strip, NYNY is the best hotel I have seen that has a total them inside and out. My sister and I decided to walk down the strip (bad idea with my sister in flats) since we didn't know there was a bus\/trolley that goes up and down the strip (bad planning...I know). As soon as we saw NYNY we made a quick turn into the hotel and instantly it's like an overwhelming sense that you're in NY w\/o the smell. I just can't sum up how well themed this hotel\/casino is. It's like you hardly notice the slots and casino feel off it because it's like you're really on vacation. 

We didn't get a chance to ride the roller coaster outside, but I'm sure it would have been a blast. The food was excellent. The slots were looser one that day than most of the other casinos on the strip (disclaimer: probably not going to be loose on the day\/time you go.... :P ).

It was an awful experience from start to finish.  The check in process took forever and when we finally got to the front, the lady was extremely rude.  After she finally found my reservation, she informed us that if we wanted an early check-in, we would have to pay an additional fee ($25-30).  They had rooms ready and we had a reservation, but they wanted to charge us to let us in one hour early!  I have NEVER had a hotel do this before.  Next, my reservation clearly requested a room on a higher floor....she gave us a room on the 5th floor.  Directly next to the roller coaster and with a ""view"" of the mechanical roof.  Our room literally shook every time the roller coaster went by.  I called to switch rooms and was placed on hold for a long time before I got a manager, who suddenly had a room for us on the 15th floor (but she made us lug our bags back down rather than offering to send someone up with a new key).  The new room was slightly quieter but that's about the only positive thing I can say.  

We could barely open the door into the room because it was so small.  The door nearly hit both the desk and the armoire.  The armoire had an old tv, three hangers (one was broken), a safe that didn't work, and a space where a refrigerator SHOULD have been. Then I went into the bathroom.  Oh my, the bathroom.  There was one sink (who has ONE sink?!) and one terrible overhead light.  The sink had built up mold and calcium on the faucet.  The shower had one of those flimsy sliding doors that never gets clean and you actually had to step into an old school, small tub in order to shower.  The shower head and faucet also had mildew and calcium deposits and the water pressure was non existent.  It was honestly one of the worst hotel bathrooms I've ever seen!

We did try to go enjoy the pool one afternoon. It's got to be one of the smallest on the Strip and at least half of it is in shade at any given time.  On top of that, the lounge chairs are easily 12 years old....they have those plastic straps but all of them are stretched out and faded. So awful!

Needless to say, our usual favorite places to stay were all booked or had outrageous price tags that we weren't willing to stay. NYNY fell within our budget so we decided to book. The check in process was fast and friendly. The woman that checked us in offered is an upgrade to a strip view room for a small fee. We agreed to the upgrade and went on our way to our room. As we boarded the elevator, I had regrets about staying here because it just isn't somewhere I'd normally stay. When we got to the room, we were shocked as it appeared that the room was occupied. The beds were undone. There were drinks on the bedside table and towels on the bathroom door. I peeked outside to catch a view since we paid for a ""strip view"" upgrade and the view was very disappointing. We headed back down to the check in desk and were ultimately given the original room that we booked. Apparently the cleaning crew had marked the room as clean when in fact it was never cleaned after the prior  occupants checked out.

I pay close attention to detail and every corner of the bathroom was spotless. Will I stay here again? Probably not, but overall it wasn't as bad as I expected.

The roller coster goes until mid-night, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  You can hear the screams and roar, loudly, the entire time it runs while in your room.  They do not inform you of this when you book a room.  They do not inform you of anything when you book the room. I called 3 times to get my confirmation emailed to me.

The house keeping staff drops the dirty laundry on the floor in the hallways while cleaning a room.  I felt like we were in a 3rd world country.  Dirty laundry was all over the place.

I've never stayed at NYNY, so this review is based solely on casual visits and gambling runs at the property. I'm a machine player, not tables, so this casino has always been appealing in that it really is machine-heavy. NYNY seems to always have new machines as soon as they come available as well, and a fine assortment of old favorites on tap, including some really old ones near the bathroom next to the casino escalators.

There is a midway upstairs and a roller coaster at this property, so DO expect a fair amount of family traffic here; it's not Circus Circus or Excalibur status when it comes to kids, but you will see them here. The coaster is something I haven't been on in over a decade; we rode it the night NYNY opened in 1997 (we drove from Orange County to Vegas and arrived at about 3am, just hours after the resort's midnight opening) and once was enough; nothing special, and now, it is VERY expensive. No thanks.

During our last trip in January, we ate dinner at the resort's Mexican restaurant, Gonzalez Y Gonzalez and LOVED it! Can't speak highly enough of the food quality (see my review under that business) and freakin YUMMY drinks! Go there and enjoy!

NYNY is within walking distance of the south end of the Strip, although Luxor and Mandalay Bay or Hooters may be a bit of a hike for some. It is right next door to Monte Carlo and across the street from Excalibur and MGM Grand; great location, and definitely worth a visit! It's changed a lot since opening day, but still has its New York theme mostly intact. One thing you won't find here are a lot of video poker machines on the floor; this casino is mostly catering to slot machines of other types (yes, VP is considered part of the slot family, but that confuses people) such as Lord of the Rings, Goldfish and Sex in the City.

Walking along the Vegas Strip and passing New York New York is a really cool experience. The hotel manages to create a feeling of walking down a New York City block. There are bridges, skyscrapers, shops, monuments, and artworks all crammed into a short distance. 

There is a roller coaster that you can ride. It speeds around the New York skyline in front. We wanted to give it a go, but we just ran out of time. The interior was cool with more decorations that made you feel like you were walking down the streets of New York City. 

There were areas that seemed a little outdated and could use some renovation, but overall it was a cool theme that was well executed. The attached Hershey store was also worth checking out.

I chose NYNY because it looked the most exciting and had a fairly good location as well as by far the lowest price of the good hotels. We booked the rooms (three days, two nights) and started packing.

Arrival was a little irritating, unlike most hotels where you park out front and go in for a quick registration, you have to actually go around back, park, then walk all the way down to the front desk. A minor inconvenience and I can see how the valet area would get packed quickly, but still unintuitive. When we got to the front desk we chatted a bit with the girl checking us in. My limitless charm netted us a free upgrade from the Skyline to the Park Avenue Deluxe. What a sweetheart!

When we got to the room we were instantly impressed and amazed with the quality of it all. The marble tiled bathroom, enormous bathroom, great view. It was fantastic. I highly recommend the Park Avenue as the minimum choice for staying here. Even if it isn't a free upgrade it's well worth the small price premium.

Other amenities were nice. The spa gave a great massage and had great features, the restaurants we ate at (Chin Chin, Gallagher's, and Gonzalez Y Gonzalez) were actually really good, and the overall upkeep seemed really great. We also watched Zumanity which I highly recommend.

I am very happy I chose NYNY as my hotel for my first trip to Vegas. That coupled with the choice to go during the week (Tues-Thurs) netted us an amazing experience that wasn't diluted with the weekend party crowd and seas of people flooding the streets. I highly recommend NYNY, and I'm sure I'll stay here again in the future.",0,1,0

The valet took our car for free and so forth. The checkout though, that was another story. It was such a nightmare, that I will never go back and I cannot recommend it to ANYONE. Ever.

First off, we wanted to have some breakfast in the buffet and planned to check out. We went to the counter and asked if someone could fetch our bags. She said we needed to be in the room. So we asked if we could go ahead and check out and go up there. She said yes. She lied. I hate employees that yes you for everything knowing full well it's not true.

So we check out, go all the way back upstairs and find that our key didn't work. Great. We ask a maid to open our door and she said she doesn't know who we are. I pull out my ID and she still refuses to open the door. She has written down that we're staying. That's not true. This was the day we were scheduled to check out. 

She says she has to call security to open the door. He also refuses to let us in to get the bag. Never mind that we have an ID, NO ONE wants to let us take OUR bags and the security guy sarcastically tells us that they wouldn't have checked us out if they knew our suitcases were upstairs. How dare him! 

I was livid and not only that, I was now sick to my stomach from the awful breakfast that we had. I barely made it into the bathroom before I lost all my breakfast. The breakfast came with an enormous price. The eggs were cold and none of it tasted any good. 

To be treated like criminals was an outrage. I could see if we didn't have IDs, but they had the list of guests, our IDs matched that list. What was their freaking problem? How dare them tell me that their employee didn't say we could go back upstairs to get our bags. There was no apology, when they realized their mistake. NOTHING.

The location is fantastic. Right on the strip next to Excalibur, MGM Grand and the Monte Carlo. Plus they host the best thrill ride in of vegas. A huge steel roller coaster that circles the cluster of skyscrapers. Far superior to the rickety Desperado of Primm, or the little coaster that used to be on top of the Stratosphere. The coaster at NYNY is a must-ride. An absolute blast!

Where the NYNY loses points in my book, is in their thorough gouging of their customers. They really milk every cent they can possibly get from you. Every single place to eat is quite overpriced in my opinion. Even with a buy1get1 voucher for entrees we decided we could do better elsewhere even without said voucher. There's a really big and cool Hershey's store in the casino - but again, they severely overcharge. You wouldn't believe what two chocolate-covered strawberries ended up costing me. They even charge you for parking. Even self parking - even if you're a guest of the hotel!

We decided to stay in the New York-New York hotel as it was decently priced and seemed to be in the middle of the strip. This was my first time in Vegas and I was traveling with a two year old. Anyway now that you have some background lets get to the review:

Rooms: Although we chose the cheapest room, it was perfectly sized, nice decor and great view. We were on the 31st floor and faced Southeast above the roller coaster. When I took my first look out the window and noticed the roller coaster, I thought---how loud is this thing gonna be. It wasn't loud at all and I really enjoyed seeing the riders screaming their heads off without hearing it. 

Entertainment: We had a baby sitter for the nigh so--me and  the wife took in a show--Zoomanity. It was very entertaining, we liked that it was performed in the hotel so we didn't have to go far. If you're easily offended or aren't into adult entertainment, this is NOT the show for you. It was a bit pricey but I'm glad we saw it.

I could go on and on but to summarize...this was a really nice place for a fair price. Centrally located on the strip and has everything you want and need within walking distance for a satisfying Vegas trip. My only complaints about the room: There was a faint stale cigaret smell noticed when we first entered the room. It didn't overwhelm and seemed to fade pretty quickly. Secondly, the room was like a meat locker and when I adjusted the thermostat---I felt more comfortable standing in the Nevada desert. I adjusted it back, pulled the covers over my head and enjoyed a couple days in Vegas at the great New York New York hotel.",4,1,1

Numerous fast options that aren't that great largely due to the fact that they are not operated by the hotel but by ARK Las Vegas. Galligers and Chin Chin are quality food. Nine Fine Irishmen is owned by the hotel and is a cool Irish pub. A little on the spendy side and not as nice as some of the other Irish themed places in town, but I still grab a Guiness there every now and again.

First, you should understand a bit about my Vegas feelings to put this review in perspective:  I agree with one fella on the Web who likened the city to a great big ""Golden Turd.""  Seriously, the city is gaudy, artificial, obnoxious, crude, expensive, and -- IMHO -- largely not worth visiting except for some good shows.

And speaking of gaudy and artificial... gah, NYNY just made me wanna puke.  I'm guessing that if any REAL New Yorker met up with the designer of this place, they'd a punch'im in da face.  And rightly so.

It's basically a cartoonish, 204785471285-slot-machined, loud faux imitation of how a mentally challenged two-year-old might perceive the actual city of New York, right down to the ""street"" signs and other signs, wall coverings, and so on.  And the ""America"" diner?  Just like real diners in NY and around America, except more polished, obnoxious, and expensive.

The pizza I had?  Definitely not NY pizza.  The ""dueling piano"" bar?  'twas people playing one real piano and a fake-piano synth.  They couldn't even have gotten two real pianos in the place?  No, wait, that'd be too much realism.

The rollercoaster?  $12.50 a ride.  You've got to be kidding me.  I didn't bother.

Blackjack tables?  Mostly $25 a hand, cheapest I saw was $15.  Again, no thanks.

And, like most big hotels in Vegas, I guess, it's laid out and lit in such a way as to make...
- getting to your room from the lobby entrance about a 20 minute trek
- finding an exit a particular challenge unless you have a compass
- enjoying even a tiny sliver of peace and quiet basically impossible, except in your room.

Oh, wait, even THAT isn't very quiet, due to the paper-thin walls.

And speaking of my room...
It was barely serviceable, with a tiny tiny desk, Internet access that required you to string a cable (literally) from one end of the room to another (TV to desk) and pay $11.99, a fan (hot\/cold) that had no automatic setting, and bedsheets that clearly didn't fit snugly on the bed 'cause they got all bunched up after laying on the bed for 5 minutes.

And why is it seemingly a universal rule that tap water in hotels tastes and\/or smells disgusting?  NYNY was no exception to this rule.

Having the hotel store your bags after checkout?  Expect to wait over 20 minutes while they tag them and then later try to (with difficulty) find them.  Other service aspects were no better.  ""Where can I get breakfast here in the morning?"" elicited great puzzlement from the person at the weirdly-named Bell Desk, who didn't seem to have any knowledge of which of the 10-15 eateries in the hotel actually served food in the morning.

*  *  *

So, with all this crapitude, why do I give the place two stars?

The bed, despite the ill-fitting sheets, was pretty comfy.  Room was nicely cleaned and not too horribly cramped.  Shower worked decently.

But still... avoid this place.  There are MUCH finer places to stay in Vegas.  If you want peace and quiet, for instance, stay at the Renaissance Inn; no infernal slot machines, huuuuuuuge rooms (suites, basically), and friendly staffers.",5,0,1

The room was ALMOST perfect, only because of the following problems:

1. There was no DVD player attached to the TV, as I had been promised by a local reservationist.

2. There were problems with the Cable TV connections in one of the 2 TVs in the room, requiring a maintenance staffer to make two visits (and doing some cable re-wiring) to correct the problem, which was never fully corrected (not due to anything involving the maintenance worker).

3. There was no in-room coffee maker\/pot, as one sometimes finds in lesser-quality inns.

The room where we stayed for 4 days (March 18-21, 2012) had a whirlpool hot tub, and it was terrific.  While there, we utlized room service on two occasions, and the meals were delivered quickly and at a reasonable price.  One meal was breakfast, while the other was a late-night pizza.  I was most impressed with their room service delivery and amenities, and would certainly recommend it to anyone who has the good fortune to be a guest there.

In particular, I'd like to mention managers Charles and Robert, maintenance worker Edwin and security staffer Tina, for the excellent customer service they extended to myself and my cousin.

One of the dealers I had, Lee, an older Asian man, took the cake in the ""Rude Dealer of the Year"" category. He had a bad attitude during the whole game and didn't speak unless something little upset him. When I sat down to play and handed my ID to the pit boss, he yelled at me demanding my ID. I told him the pit boss had it and he had the gall to shake his head like I was in the wrong. He immediately talked himself out of being tipped. 

When I wasn't playing and was watching my friend play, I pat the table when my friend got an ace (good luck measure for the next card to be a face card, seen all over the Strip), and he BARKED at me saying ""hey! I don't like that! You're not even playing!"" Excuse me, we're trying to have a good time and you're just an asshole. I didn't reach towards the cards or the chips and every other dealer is okay with this. I barked back ""I don't like YOU"" and my friend and I both left.

The New York New York would've made some money off of us if they had dealers who had better attitudes but they quickly affirmed that we would never be back. If you don't like your job as a dealer and can't be entertaining, especially in Las Vegas, you need to switch careers.",1,1,0

We actually had a nightstand in between the beds instead of a desk that's usually in the room. Our desk had an outlet in the side that was popping open a little bit. The outside of the windows were disgusting and had a bunch of dirt built up on them. My friend asked if the window had paint on it it was that bad. The biggest issue I had was with the staff. There was a little bit of a line to check out so I went to the Mlife priority line. I stood there next to the sign with my gold Mlife card in hand and they kept pulling people from the check in line with out even acknowledging me. Ask if I need help tell me I'm in he wrong line but you don't just ignore a guest standing in line. That's not even bad customer service that's no customer service.

The ""view"" costs extra and is not worth it; our view consisted of the roller coaster, a beat-up roof, the airport and two hotels: Excalibur & Tropicana.   Based on the extra cost, I was expecting a strip view (not two hotels but the ability to see down the strip at night etc).  If I had to do it over again I  would not pay extra for a room with a view as it is nothing to pay extra for.  

The room itself was clean and the beds were comfortable.  It is a large hotel so the walk to\/from the elevators is a bit of a hike but we were expecting that as all the mega hotels are like that.  We were on the 16th floor and one thing we did not expect was the noise from the roller coaster.  I certainly knew it was there when we booked the room but I did not think about it running all day and well into the middle of the night.  The roller coaster itself makes quite a bit of noise and when people ride a roller coaster they scream...constantly. 

There is a $20 ""resort fee"" with the hotel which is a total rip off.  What you get is free ""high speed"" wifi (that works at a SNAILS pace...think back to the days of dial-up internet). You get a free newspaper with it (if you want to trek downstairs to the shop and ask for it but I don't know why you would want one anyway).  The fee also allows you to print an airline boarding pass (what a bargain at $20 a day...insert sarcastic face).  

The hotel looks awesome from the outside and has an awesome decor inside (they also brought New York prices in for all the shops and food vendors...a soda is $3).  The staff were all friendly and the casino was pretty standard.   

While the hotel is neat and the room was clean I would not stay here again.  You can come (for free) and visit the fun parts and stay at a better place.

And since Yelp refuses to give us use of a 1\/2 star, I am forced to round, and as this was a very enjoyable 3.5 star experience, it goes up to 4.

We booked a room here for the Rock n Roll Marathon and Half Marathon weekend.  It wasn't our first choice, but we waited way too long to book the room, and by the time we pulled the trigger, it was either here or the MGM, which is where we stayed the last time.  I like the MGM, but we decided that we could save a lot of money here, and it would be some place new, so worth taking the risk.

Neither of us had high expectations.  We looked at it like a Quality Inn or some similar quality hotel, just bigger (Vegas style).  We were wrong. Firstly, I booked the room using 2 methods.  3 of our nights were booked using myvegas comps from facebook.  Been playing those freaking games for a year, and it paid off.  Got 3 rooms for free, except for taxes and resort fees.  The 4th night I booked through the race website and got probably 30-40% off.  Unfortunately, because I wanted to use my freebies on the most expensive nights, it ended up being 3 reservations (thurs\/Fri, Sat, and then Sun).  I heard stories that the hotel would make you check out and check back in each day, and possibly switch rooms.  However, that was not our experience.  The booking agents through myvegas and the race were able to link the reservations so that when we showed up to check in, the front desk clerk basically merged them all and we never even had to go back down to re-check in each day.  In fact, the only hiccup was the information housekeeping received apparently showed the checkout on Saturday, but they knocked and then left when I explained they were mistaken.  No harm done.

So - customer service was fantastic.  As for the rooms - really comfortable.  Beds were easy to sleep in, linens were soft.  Rooms weren't huge, but spacious enough (we were in a ""Park Avenue King,"" basically their smaller room (400 sq. ft +\/-)).  Large bathrooms with awesome showers (hot and strong water pressure).  My only complaint about the room is that we were over the roller coaster and could hear it and people screaming whenever it was running.  Not very loud, and it didn't keep me awake for long, but you could hear it in the background.  Tip for you would be to ask if your room is over the coaster, and if so, try to get a higher floor so maybe it will be more muted (we were on the 17th).  And wifi was free (well, it was included in your resort fee, but some places don't give you wifi with your resort fee).

The rest of the hotel was fine.  The casino isn't huge, but I found tables to play at easily enough with room.  As this is NY NY and not Wynn or Bellagio, they had plenty of $10 limit and other low limit tables.  It was fairly easy to get in and out of the hotel (i.e., unlike MGM, you didn't have to walk for 20 minutes just to get to the front door).  Our check in and check out was very quick and smooth, but we arrived at 8:00 PM and left at 8:00 AM, so timing might have had something to do with that.  The sportsbook looked comfortable, but I didn't spend any time in there (plenty of screens and TVs, like you would expect).

I only ate at the Broadway Burger Bar and reviewed that separately.  We otherwise didn't spend any time in the hotel.  I did use their coffee stand for some coffee and tea (not starbucks, thank god, but that may have been somewhere else in the hotel).  Both the coffee and tea were very good.  Trying to remember what brand tea they served, and I can't, but I do remember it being high quality.  

The only other thing to comment on is that this simply looked like a fun hotel.  Every night down on the casino floor were people cheering and laughing and having fun.  There is a bar by the room elevators that does dueling pianos, and it was constantly packed with people singing along.  Only draw back is I heard they charged an obnoxious cover for a lobby bar - even with entertainment.  

I'd stay here again.  I'll probably want to try someplace new for my next trip, but I will definitely keep NY NY in mind as a fallback.",5,1,1

However, if you are not you will like this little strip version of NY. The outside is supposed to look like a NYC view, meh. It is really cool because this is the hotel that hosts the roller coaster on the strip. Huge tourist attraction. So if you are coming here remember this is the hotel that has it. Finding it is kinda tricky but once you ride it its kinda cool. I find the roller coaster old and rocky. I'm always sore coming off it lol.

When you enter the hotel there is a huge casino. Reminds me of planet hollywoods casino. Has plenty of restaurants there. My favorite is chin chin. They have the Hershey store here and also on the first level they have the Hershey bar. Prepare for a very sweet chocolatey adult beverage.

Another centrally located hotel. You can get to many hotels from here. Rooms in the hotel are nice. Nothing over the top. I visited a Friend here in a simple room. I'm sure they have other cool rooms that I just haven't seen. Hotel is worth checking out. It's never over priced and I haven't heard bad things about this hotel!",4,0,3

Was recently at NYNY for 9 nights for work reasons and figured any of the big name hotels on the Strip would be just fine.  Sadly, by the end of my stay I had a little collection of less than favorable remarks for my Yelp entry, not the least of which was the fact that they didn't change the sheets on the bed until I left a note with an arrow pointing at what looked like some previous guest's dried nosebleed stain that the maid was I guess trying to ignore - Ewww.  On to better topics.. their premiere steakhouse.  On my first night, I sat at the bar and ordered a wedge salad, glass of Cabernet, and a filet. The wine and salad were fine, but the steak was so overdone that when the bartender came to ask how it was, she answered her own question by saying ""oh that's embarrassing.""  She had the host come and take the hockey puck away.  When the host brought a new one he said it was the least they could do because after all, they ARE a steak house and should be able to cook a steak. Yep.  Okay, so everyone has an off night, and I figured maybe since I was sitting at the bar, they didn't make their best presentation... several nights later, I thought I'd give it another try.  Came back to hotel from work, stopped at hostess stand and made a reservation for a couple hrs later and requested to dine this time at a small table - went and worked-out, showered, got dressed for the evening and came back to start it off with a lovely dinner.  They put me all the way back in the furthest room in the darkest corner.  Not exactly the right way to make a single diner feel comfortable or ever want to come back!      No problem, because there are a few other restaurants in NYNY.. none that are spectacular, but lots of street vendor hot pretzels and pizza slices, so you at least won't starve.  My fave dining experience was the night I went to the upstairs bar at ""9 Fine Irishmen"".  The bartender Dave made me feel welcome, suggested a great salmon, poured a good glass of wine and made conversation - I even enjoyed the Irish band that started playing at 9pm - a really fun evening! 
As far as the staff at NYNY goes, there were some interesting inconsistencies. The front desk folks, players club folks and concierge were all fantastic - accommodating, happy to assist, and competent.  The duds were at the pool and Starbucks.  The boy at the towel stand wielded his ""one-towel-per-customer"" policy like nobody's business.. which would've been fine if it hadn't been perfectly alright to have two towels the day before and the day after, so I don't know what his story was.. But the Starbucks ladies are not to be missed!  They are the rudest, slowest, most unenthusiastic bunch of Starbucks employees I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with!  Each morning, I left my room a good 15 mins early to get down there and stand in line to watch the slow progression of guests get manhandled by these women.  Monique or Monica even told me one morning (after the players club employees had trained me to use my players club card with every purchase in the hotel to get points or comps) that she had already entered the number.. she hadn't even looked at the card, so just to entertain myself I walked over to the players club desk and inquired about whether my Starbucks purchase had registered on my card... nope.  They of course made up for her laziness (and untruthfulness) and gave me credit for the purchase.  So if you want to feel like Piper Chapman in an episode of ""Orange is the New Black"" standing in the food line in prison, make sure to stop by the Starbucks each morning during your stay at New York New York!",1,4,1

Anyway, the Palms was completely booked up and this was the most convenient hotel to stay in that I wasn't scared would give me some kind of STD just from touching the sheets.

Aaaaanyway, I remember why I hate this place. There's really no Verizon or AT&T service in the rooms, making tethered Internet useless, and the in room wifi is so slow I'd imagine I'd get better speeds on a satellite link in a dacha somewhere near Siberia. But I'm here for work, I'm not picking mushrooms in a forest so no useful Internet access is kind of a non-starter. 

Also, the food options here kinda suck. Chin Chin is miserable, Gonzales y Gonzales is kinda eh from my drunken recollections years ago, Il Fornaio is like a more expensive Spaghetti Factory, the sports bar that may still be here served me one of the worst steaks of my life....actually I've eaten at at lot of the restaurants here and I don't know why, I should have just crossed the street to the tram and gone to Mandalay.

Also, my TV randomly turned on at 3:30am, and no, I did not bump the remote, it was on the far end of my nightstand, well out of reach, there was no kind of laundry bag for dry cleaning (which I like to steal for my dirty laundry), and somehow there was no shampoo or conditioner in my hotel room.

For one thing having a microwave and refrigerator in the room would be nice!  Also at the front desk they told us there was a computer we could use to print our boarding passes and when we went to use it the computer stated it was a $5 charge to use it which was fine but then when I checked my bank statement I got charged two $11 charges for it. One of the charges then fell off when the charges went from pending to posted. I didn't make a fuss or anything about these charges but users beware! Also in this hotel the ATM charges were crazy. To use the ATM with your debit card it was like a 6 dollar charge and to run a card as a credit card on the ATM was a 19 dollar charge and if you were running it as a credit you would get a receipt from the ATM machine that stated you had to take it to a cashier to finish the transaction because it was run as a credit and not a debit.

Overall though the hotel and casino was very nice and I would stay there again.

Looking for cheap drinks? Check out the 'chiller' stand in the casino, souvenir cup is $16 but refills are only $12 and you can really taste the alcohol so you get your money's worth. 
There's a New York pretzel stand that sells 'pretzel dogs', but don't get any there, goto the Excalibur and check out Auntie Annes. You get more for the same price and they make it fresh when you order. 
The sign says parking is only for guests but they give you no decal or anything to distinguish you as a guest of the hotel and they wave everyone in, so be careful about locking your car.
There's a 'resort fee' of $18 a day but they'll waive the fee if anything is wrong. We found a wet spot on the carpet when we checked into our room, they took two days off. My boyfriend accidentally used a towel stained with grease and he was able to get 3 more days off, so that we didn't have to pay the resort fee at all. 
They have a Cirque show 'zumanity' playing at the hotel but it wasn't playing the week we were there, although we did see the KA show across the street at the MGM, a must see if you can get tickets. There's an indoor 'tix4tonight' box office across the street inside the coke a cola store front, we got a good deal from them, at least a $40 discount from reg price. But if you want KA or another really popular show you should show up at least by 9:15am to stand in line the day of the show, they open by 10am. 
The Chin Chin restaurant is a good choice for their breakfast buffet or for dinner. The breakfast buffet is really limited but they have a rice dish with pork, peas, and carrots that is delicious.

I've always had the urge to stay here every time I visited Vegas--from the outside, it looks awesome, and everytime I walk passed it, looks like a really fun place to play\/drink\/eat.

Location

NY NY is located a little south of the main four (Ceasars\/Ballys\/Paris\/Bellagio) yet it's not so bad of a location if you're trying to get to the south end as well as the north end.  The tram out of the MGM (just a walk over the bridge) is an easy ride for the day.  It's also relatively close to the airport, which can be somewhat helpful.

Check In

Checking into the hotel was very fast.  Having the advantage of the ""guest-invited line,"" it did save some time from standing in line.  My requests were all honored at that time as well--high floor, away from the rollar coasters, and a view.  Not bad.  9\/10

Rooms

The distance from the elevators of the 24th floor to the rooms was SOOO far!  It definitely didn't help when my friends and I were a bit drunk! :p  It's like walking through a maze.  Not very pleasant.  Once we got to the room though, I was fairly impressed.  It's got everything we needed--beds\/tv\/safety box...but I will complain that the bathroom door lock was broken.  Didn't bother to call maintenence b\/c only there for a few days though.  It was overall--clean and well-kept.  In all, who cares how the room looks....only there to pass out and shower right?

Casino Floor

Quite spacious and a good choice of machines.  Could be winner's first luck!  Not too smokey.  Not gigantic which makes it easy to navigate the floor easily.

Restaurants\/Bars

Didn't dine out at the restaurants however made a food stop at Nathan's!  Sooooo goood!!!

I would return back to the NY NY.  The rooms were comped and the location isn't so bad.  Next time, I will be requesting for a room closer to the elevators.  Other than that, no complaints!",0,0,0

They have little areas for children to enjoy and areas for adults to enjoy. It's got variety and lots of options as far as things to do. IT's also a convenient spot to really see a lot of the strip without having to walk so much. You can cross the bridge to shop at the small shops and watch a movie at the Shocase Mall. Also, the M&M Factory is just a few steps away, alongside the ultimate arcade, Gameworks! The other bridge also sends you to Excalibur if your in the mood for a nice renaissance adventure.

The rooms are very nice and clean. Very spacious (I mean like can get 20 people to dance in the common room special) for a standard suite. The bed is big and comfy with a small little lazy seat. The bathroom however, is small but I guess it's because the wide open spaces are taken up by the big living area and sleeping area. Great view of Las Vegas as well!

I actually ended up enjoying my stay.  I did the $20 front desk trick I learned from that website got a free upgrade.  Slightly bigger room with strip view.  Wasn't the best but for $20, it was definitely worth it.

Had a 2 for 1 coupon for the coaster, and it was fun!  I'm Canadian and the closest thing we have to a decent coaster is the Tea-Cup ride.

1: Shower clogged first time we used it. had to shower in 4 inches of standing water. We called the front desk and they did have someone come repair it while we were out. Problem was when we got back the shower was unclogged but completely disgusting. Covered with black specks of god knows what. Had to ask a maid in the hallway to come clean it. 

2: On the topic of maids (and really this is probably not that big a deal but just irked me). We are in Vegas...why is housekeeping knocking on my door before 9am. I mean I should have put the stupid don't knock thing on my door but holy cow. We are checking out at 11 the same day. Why are you bugging us at 830?! 

3: Everyone is right - the walls are paper thin. It's obnoxious. Also (and this is probably our fault for staying here) but the roller coaster was outside our window and sooooo loud (even though we were on the 24th floor). 

4: The pizza sucked. My husband is a New Yorker and was looking forward to some good New York style pizza. Instead we got about 5 pounds of smooshy dough. Nothing New York about it. 

5: While the room was clean and okay in style, the bedding sucked. The pillows were horrible. I usually love hotel pillows because they are so soft and nice. These ones were like Prison style. Super uncomfortable. 

6: Last but not least, there is no way to change the temp in the room. We were pretty hot and uncomfortable. Would have been nice to have been able to kick the temp down a few degrees. 

So basically, yes it's a bit cheaper than staying more central to the strip but unless you can't afford better I would not recommend it at all. We are 100% we will never stay there again.  It's not a dump so to say but it's not the Vegas experience I look for.",3,2,0

 I'll say that they do take care of their frequent gamblers here better than a lot of other places. My mother and her friends have stayed for free a number of times because of time that their husbands have put in at the tables.

I didnt care for the room decor very much -- it looked like a generic hotel room and was rather dark and dingy.  It was comfortable though, if not particularly spacious.  What I do like about this hotel is all the food options.  They have almost every type of food imaginable and at all price ranges. You don't have to leave the hotel to find something yummy to eat, and I especially liked the crepes place.  Another restaurant that stood out was Gonzalez y Gonzalez -- they serve huge, delicious flavored margarita's here for a great price and really yummy taquitos. A great value on the strip especially.  I wouldn't mind staying here again, just because it's cheap and I don't have to kill my feet walking out of the hotel to find affordable food options.

ETA: Stayed here again recently and received the $150 drink credit.  Not worth it if you ask me, unless you're staying for 4 nights or something.

We called the day before to see about early check in. ""Oh, yeah. Happens all the time. Come when you need to."" So we went from our last hotel to NYNY, arriving at noon on a random Wednesday. Of course our room was not ready, not unless we wanted to pay the same price we would have for our Jacuzzi room in exchange for a newly clean, yet un-renovated and smoking room. Ah, Vegas logic.  They told us to check back with them in an hour as we watched countless other parties get the keys to their rooms. Of course an hour later our room was still not ready, and after going through these motions for three more hours we finally got in our room at 4:30. 
Our Jacuzzi room was decent, with a fair view of the roller coaster at the hotel, the pool, and a ton of parking lots. The TV only received about 5 basic cable channels, weak in comparison to my bunny ears at home, or even the 6 NYNY channels promoting itself and its lousy shows. We ordered a movie since there was nothing on TV, but it's quality was equally static-driven and fuzzy. Waste of money, as was the $13\/day Internet access code. 
Since there was no safe we didn't want the housekeepers to clean our room; they were kind (or annoying?) enough to call us and ask if we want them to come and clean anyway. I though that's what the sign was for? 
The pool was decent, especially if you arrive before the high-noon sun, otherwise there is no shade. You can watch the rollercoaster to your hearts content fly over you heads all day long from your pool lounge chair.  Thankfully there aren't a ton of screaming kids running around or hookers with butt-baring skirts trying to sell you beer. The pop-music played at top volume at the pool can get a little annoying after awhile, though. 
Another thing that annoyed me is the décor of this place. I don't think they every made a final decision of what kind of theme they were going for - 30's New York flare or pretty pink flowers as seen in the room décor? Personally I would have gone with simple black and white photography and run road signs, but what do I know?

Stay at NYNY if: You have kids who crave an arcade (though there are sketchy Zumanity ads everywhere); if you love an Irish pub; if you want to watch the roller coaster all day long (though the Bellagio fountain show is much more entertaining); you are on a budget (in exchange for quality).

There were wadded up Kleenex balls right outside my room and she just walked by them. Gross. I thought maybe she just didn't see them. On the third day there, I'm pretty sure someone in housekeeping had to have seen them but they were still there.

1. Location. Right next to Excalibur. From Excalibur, take a tram to Luxor or Mandalay Bay. 

Right next to Monte Carlo. From Monte Carlo, walk into Aria or take a tram to the new Crystals mall or the Bellagio. From the Bellagio, walk across the street to Caesar's Palace (which is across from Bally's and Flamingo).

Walk across the street to MGM, M&M World, Coke World, and GameWorks arcade.

2. Spa Suite. Spa Suites (with jacuzzi tubs) on the Strip range in price with the Luxor and NYNY on the low end, MGM and Monte Carlo on the slightly higher end, then up to Treasure Island and Caesar's Palace, until you get into the super expensive hotels like Bellagio and Venetian or hotels that only have jacuzzi tubs in pent-house priced suites like Paris. 

NYNY's spa suite is spacious and the tub is a clover-shaped tub with four jets in the bottom. The jets can hit the small of your back or your legs, but because of where they are located, they cannot massage your back or shoulders. There is plenty of room for two. For the price, well worth it (we paid $80\/night in August). 

3. Nine Fine Irishmen. Good food with real Irish (or at least British) fare as opposed to an American menu with fish and chips thrown in. The food is quality (I highly recommend the butter and caramel bread pudding) and the vibe is relaxing. 

4. Dueling Pianos. Throughout the afternoon and evening, one bar has dueling pianos where two pianists take requests from the audience and play them on the piano and sing. However, it's more than that. They are entertainers and will sometimes parody a song. There's no cover, actual tables (but also dance floor) and food and bar service. It's a great way to have an entertaining evening without the ridiculous cost of a bottle service at a night club and since you can influence the music being played, more likely to cater to your tastes. 

5. The resort fee includes the wi-fi. 

6. Access to Monte Carlo's pool. 

Cons. 
1. Temperature control in the rooms. The thermostat is not programmable. You just toggle a little bar from ""warm"" to ""cool"". Our room was freezing, but if I moved it just a smudge toward ""warm,"" the heater (and it's bad, unused heater smell) kicked on. 

2. Pool is unimpressive, but you have access to the far superior Monte Carlo pool as a NYNY guest.",5,0,2

I highly recommend the $20 trick when not staying on a weekend or during a major event! (Basically slip a folded $20 bill between your ID and credit card at check in and ask if there are any ""complimentary"" upgrades available. This is a Vegas hotel standard, all the check in staff will know what you mean at any hotel pretty much!) 

The rooms are nice, even the simple most basic rooms have a very clean design and upgraded feeling to them. The suites are also very nice. (The $20 trick got me an upgrade to a spa suite). The little book of coupons they give at check in are great, especially since it includes 2 roller coaster rides per room! The 2-for-1 drinks and meals can be useful if you stay around the hotel\/casino. 

I'm a big fan of attention to detail, probably why I am such a huge Disneyland fan, and in many ways, I see Las Vegas as kinda like Disneyland for adults.

I really have no complaints. 

As far as dining options, Gonzalez y Gonzalez was soooo good! I am still dreaming about the shredded beef crispy tacos and the guac they make tableside. Chin Chin was pretty good too as was America. We ate at America for breakfast (veggie egg white frittata-yum) and carried out rueben sandwiches at 3AM  that were pretty good. The fries are really great, good seasoning. It was nice to have a 24 hour restaurant to order what ever you want and take to your room. My only dining warning is to stay away from NYP-the pizza place they have. It is worse than Sbarro! Cold pizzas that were cooked hours ago with very little to no sauce on them that are then reheated in the oven when you order a slice. They were really gross and the garlic knot I tried was dried out, hard and flavorless. 

The center bar was a cool place to chill with leather couches all around (2 drink pp minimum which was no problem for us!) Pour 24 was a pretty chill place to with a great beer and cocktail selection. 

NYNY was exactly what we were looking for. A comfy room to crash in, plenty of restaurant and bar choices, good casino with decently loose slots and great walking distance from the other main hotels.

The pool SUCKS. Super tiny with barely any room for more than 3 lounge chairs and I guess it's considered a family friendly hotel b\/c it was crammed with kids and grandparents.

The room faced the back corner of the hotel so the view was less than stellar, mostly just the walls of the hotel along with a partial view of the roller coaster. The room itself was nothing special, I've stayed in nicer Super 8s!

It might be normal for hotels in Vegas to charge their guests to use their computers\/printers but I've never had to do that in other hotels so that was annoying.

This year, I stayed on the opposite and very far end of the strip at Hilton Grand Vacations and I will review that later.  The NYNY room is reasonably sized.  I will say it fits two comfortably.  Of course you have the resort fees which is a downer - but to be expected in Vegas.  I really have nothing negative to say about the place.  I would stay there again.",0,0,0

Nevertheless, I found my stay to be quite pleasant and reasonably fun for a solo business trip.

My tiny room directly overlooked the strip from the 18th floor, but the windows were so minuscule that I wouldn't exactly call it a view. There was a nice, big flatscreen in the room. The cable came with the usual suspects. No premium channels--they want you to pony up extra cash for the movies. The room was acceptably clean and the nights were quiet enough.

The casino is like any other. I don't gamble, so not much to hold my interest there. New York New York does have a nice, varied selection of eateries right there in the casino. Two of the places I tried were quite good.

The gift shops have a big selection of drinks and snacks, which I appreciate, since I like to spend my travel evenings hunkered down in my room watching TV and working on my laptop. Free wi-fi for guests. There's also a reasonably appointed gym.

Only one bad thing to us though:
The music heard in the casino at  1:00 AM  on Sat into Sunday  was loud and BAD BAD BAD.   They were blasting  RAP music,  which I consider the lowest common denominator of bad taste in music.  It's not even music,  it's street thug, gangster, low class, low IQ, poor people's NOISE !   Electronica music would have been a welcome change.   If I was the hotel manager,  I would fire the music director because of his ""limited"" scope and vision.  
Also at that time all the drink spots were full to capacity, standing room only, no available seating,  with a bunch of drunks everywhere. That's O.K. but I've been there \/ done that.

Let me start with the good:

Zumanity!  Love this Circ de Soleil show located at NYNY.  Such a fun show with amazing energy by some awesome performers.  Definitely a must see if you're in Vegas.  Plus it's one of the only Circ shows you can find some great discounts for if you look around.

The Theme: As a former Manhattan resident I love the New York theme from the hotel shaped like NY skyscrapers, to the little Greenwich village inside the casino with restaurants and shops.

Location: Great location on the strip with easy access to MGM, Mandalay Bay, and City Center.

Now on to the not so good

The room: The rooms here are tiny and drab.  Plus because of the layout of the hotel it's usually a hike from the elevator to your room.  The air conditioner in our room seemed pretty weak, which left our room HOT, even with it running on ""high.""  In the middle of summer in Las Vegas you do not want to be sleeping on top of the sheets and blankets still sweating balls.  Also the walls are extremely THIN.  Every morning at 5:00 am I could hear the lady in the room next door talking on the phone.  And I mean, I could hear her entire conversations.  Not very conducive to sleep when you were out late.

The Pool: The pool is way to small for the size of the resort.  Also there are not enough chairs around so you usually end up without one.  And it's a BORING pool.  Nothing exciting about it.  The drinks are overpriced which is to be expected, but they are also extremely WEAK.

Prices: The rooms are about on par with the Excalibur in my mind, but the prices are usually double.  You're better off staying there than at NYNY.  The $12.95 resort fee is ridiculous, as is $14 for one ride on the roller-coaster, and $5 for a hot dog at Nathans.  I have never tried any of the other restaurants here so can't comment on them.

Bottom line: definitely check out the NYNY while you're in Las Vegas, but spend your money elsewhere.",0,0,0

The beds were a bit hard for our liking and you can definitely hear that darn roller coaster. Luckily week nights it stops at 11pm. The 7th floor and our room would sometimes smell of smoke, other guests on the floor also mentioned it. We also found the casino very cold compared to other casinos but I think it might be because that darn roller coaster goes right through the interior of the casino so the cold winter air was getting in.

It was a very basic standard room.  No view, no thrills, just ok for sleeping.

Biggest gripe was that the room smelled BAD when I first arrived.  After some complaining, the housekeeper came up and sprayed it with room freshener.  Problem is that they sprayed so much that I wanted to GAG!  What was worse - before or after?  I'm still asking myself...

I will say that upon check-in they gave me a free upgrade which included 50 feet of more space and a pillow top bed.  I was tired every night so I slept like a baby.  That was great.

TIP:  There's nothing worse than your room being far from the elevator.  The upgraded rooms are all closer to the elevators.  OH, and bring your own toiletry.  They only give you the low quality stuff!

Once we finally got checked in, we decided to roam around a bit. Get back to our rooms around 3am to find out that the water had been shut off and wouldn't be available for a couple of hours. I could see where this would normally be ok but considering we weren't able to get to our room until around 2 am and we all wanted showers after our flight, this was a huge inconvenience for us. 

The next day, we went to the mLife desk... 3 people working, around noon, huge line and I can say we wasted at least 20 minutes just to get players cards... which, they offered no free play, since I had signed up 5 years ago on my last vacation. So nice to see them charge $20\/person for resort fees and their players club couldn't even hook it up with something! 

 After spending some time in the casino, we went to go back up to our room (around 2pm) to find out the elevators were not working. They were expected to be back up and running in about an hour. I asked the security gentleman where the stairs were, because I needed to get to my room. Security told me (2 security gentleman who were standing together) ""um... we aren't sure where the stairs come out at. Our elevator guy is stuck on the 14th floor and we are waiting for him to find a way down here to fix the elevators""

Excuse me, WHAT?  Security doesn't know where the stairs come out??? That didn't make me feel very confident, that's for sure! After about 10 minutes of waiting with multiple other guests, another guest came to us and said she had found the service elevators and she used those to get to her room. Without any help from any of the clueless staff, another guest was able to lead us to the back area of the casino so we could ride service elevators to our rooms. What's worse is none of the staff in the back area found this odd or tried to tell us we were out of place. It almost seemed normal for them to encounter guests in the service area.

After all of this, my party asked for a late checkout. The front desk was less than helpful and informed us, regardless of the issues we encountered, if we wanted 2 extra hours, we would be charged $20. I get that it is policy and all of that but after the nightmare we had for a stay, they could have at least offered to waive the fee.

I would not recommend this motel to anyone. Obviously they are understaffed and when their security guards don't even know where the staircase is... that really tells you something about how well they train their staff. What's even worse is at check in, one front desk agent even made a comment about ""complaining won't do you any good here"" when we asked why it took over an hour to check in at 1am!

The fixtures in the bathroom looked a bit dated and old.  I liked that they had complimentary drinks (sodas and water) in the frige but they were all Pepsi products (which I'm not a fan of).  The large curved couch in the living room was comfy but I questioned the cleanliness of the room when a single dirty sock and glasses were found under the couch.

I'm really struggling here between 3 or 4 stars. I think 3.5 would be the most accurate. 

The room we got was perfect for us - a king suite with a view of the strip. It was easy access to the parking lot and the casino, which was nice. Every other casino\/hotel I've stayed at hasn't been this convenient. 

The pool area is pretty small and quite windy. It was disappointing heading out for some sun and pool when there were very few chairs to choose from and the wind was blowing hard - like the blow-your-hat-off-your-head kinda wind. I know that wind is typical for Vegas, but this was worth noting. 

The New York street food area is a nice lighting and ambiance, but food options here at the hotel itself were quite limited. We gave the Il Fornaio happy hour a try, and that was nice. No buffet here. But again, that's nice as it attracts less crowds. 

The casino is deceptively small. But that's ok - just go across the way to MGM or next door to Monte Carlo if you want more options. The benefit of the small casino floor is less crowds. 

All in all, it's in a pretty good location. We like walking and didn't mind walking up the strip for our shows and food. 

I also HIGHLY recommend signing up for the M Life players club and using it every chance you can. We got discounts on Cirque du Soleil tickets, and you can use it at any MGM resort.

I liked NYNY better than I thought I would.  Having been to NYC a bunch I wasn't sure how I would receive this simulacrum.

As a hotel\/casino it is a pretty good base.  There is no shortage of food, gambling and people watching.  I got a double upgrade from the room I reserved for some reason.  It could be because I ""chat people up"".  It's a good skill.  Could also be because they had low occupancy and want to woo me back.  No, sure it was purely as a result of my charm and wit.

So the room was nicely appointed.  Tasteful and modern decor.  I got a corner room with a ridiculous amount of windows all along two walls.  Nice view of the strip to the south, mountains to the west and a roller coaster zooming by.  

NYNY has some odd layouts, probably as a result of the effort to resemble the Manhattan skyline.  I think this leads to unusual things like this:  my room had two large pillars, one near the doorway, the other toward the outside corner.  These pillars created dead space that could easily hide several people.  Hmm.  I am not a paranoid traveler but I am an aware traveler.  So I had to peer behind these pillars whenever I returned to the room to mentally check off - yes, I did make sure no one was back there.

The bed was comfy and firm but the sheets felt slightly plasticized.  They felt a little funny and crinkled oddly when I moved.  What exactly were they expecting to happen in this bed anyway?  

150 yards.  Remember the odd layout?  From the elevator to my door was 150 yards.  150 paces and my pace is just over 3 feet.  And there were rooms farther than mine.  I expected there must be another elevator at the other end but no.  And the hallway takes many turns.  The first time I left the room and headed for the elevator I thought I must have passed it already.

Overall, I would stay here again for sure.  Hopefully I can ""chat them up"" for an upgrade or two again!",10,9,9

Here is what happen: 
Tuesday: over charged us
Wednesday morning: maid walked in on my husband and I because she said Front desk told her we were checked out. 
Wednesday early morning: got locked out of our room because someone in the front desk ""forgot"" we have a back to back reservation. 
Thursday night: got locked out again, we had to ask security to let us in. When we called the front desk they said I shouldn't put my room key near my wallet. (I've been coming to Las Vegas for over 15years, don't you think I know that) not once did they take responsibility. 
Friday morning: called the front desk again to ask for Hotel supervisor, she's not there again. But assured us she would call Saturday morning.

Als Stilelemente wurden Nachbauten des Empire State Buildings, des Chrysler Buildings, der Brooklyn Bridge und der Freiheitsstatue gewählt. Mit der Achterbahn ""The Roller Coaster"", die über 2 Loopings verfügt, kann man die Skyline New Yorks umkreisen. Im Inneren des Gebäudes hat man den Times Square, die Park Avenue, Little Italy und den Broadway nachgebaut.

Das Casino ist mit 7.812 m² nicht so groß geraten und verfügt über 80 Spieltische, wie Blackjack, Craps, Roulette, Mini Baccarat, Pai Gow Poker, Caribbean Stud Poker, Big Six, Casino War, Keno, Renn- und Sportwetten und mehr als 2.000 Slots. Für die wohlhabende Kundschaft gibt es den Players Club ""M life Players Club"", wo man sein Spielglück austesten kann.

Being a hotel connoisseur I pride myself on being knowledgeable about what is acceptable in a hotel and what is not acceptable. For example, nice beds rank very high for me. A nice bed is defined as a bed that is cushy, not a bed that feels like its been a hotel bed for 100 years. New York New York beds were a little rough on the back and for me, someone who likes a softer mattress left some kinks in my neck each morning. The room service was very nice and I was happy to notice the opportunity to order whatever we wanted from the menu. We were very lucky when it came down to the front desk because we asked for a better room from our first room and they obliged. Interestingly, we went through 2 rooms before we found one that was perfect. We finally found a room that offered a strip view, king size bed and a little living room area. My fiance was there for 2 days previous to me and he was enjoying a conference for his work. They closed down the Brooklyn Bridge for a welcoming afternoon of open bar and appetizers. They also chose to close down the streets of New York for another banquet during the conference.

1. Location (Tropicana and the Strip. Nice.)
2. Theme
3. Price
4. Gambling Facilities (that I like)
5. Dining options
6. Size: not too big, not too small, not hard to get lost

I the NYNY casino because of the fact that it's in a great location and the theme that it offers is rather genius. I honestly do not have a desire to go to New York city, however, I do have an appreciation of the fact that the designers of the casino did an excellent job at making sure that the details were made to look really nice! It's a classy place, and for me, it wasn't over the top, which some places feel like. 

It's location on the South Strip is nice. Most of the facilities in that particular area are really new, mostly stuff built in the 90s, with the exception of the Tropicana (which I hear is perking up). Either way, it's good for families that choose to go to Las Vegas. It's the epitome of the ""new"" Las Vegas, which is what Al Pacino calls the ""Adult Disneyland,"" as he describes in the movie Casino. For the record, though, I'm a big fan of the old school Vegas, where you can have your whiskey and gamble at the same time while trying to be somewhat classy, but not way over the top like many places are now. 

The Theme. Awesome. What can I say? The design is brilliant and fun. 

Prices for hotels for this particular hotel are average for this area. Book online and you will find good rates. If you like living on the edge and know that travel season is not ""hot"" or it isn't fight night at the Mandalay or MGM, waiting last minute can be awesome too. 

Gambling facilities. I like the smaller sports book this place offers. Also, I appreciate the fact that the sports book is distinctly separated from the race book. I like the racing aspect of gambling and appreciate the fact that cocktail waitresses are quick to offer beverages for gamblers in this area. They were also really nice, too. 

Food. Good food makes a big piece of the casino. The Burger Bar they have in here is really good. Go see my review. 

The size of the whole resort is really big. It's not as big as the Mandalay Bay, MGM, or other similar resorts, but there's still a lot of room. I wouldn't be surprised that if they gutted out the casino floor, they can host a huge monster truck show and fill it up with about 20,000 seats in there. Either way, I appreciate the fact that casino is roomy and structured in a way that I won't easily get lost in the sea of tables and slot machines. I hate the fact that I can get lost in a casino and take hours for me to find my way out (case in point the MGM Grand). 

Yay! I'm a fan.",0,0,0

Literally, the view was horrible - a $50 room at the 26th floor had a view 10 times better than mine. The Bose sound system in the room didn't work at all, even after trouble shooting.

Trivia: which props do NOT have a buffet on the strip? Answer: Ballys, Venetian\/Palazzo, and NYNY.
Casino has some life and very scrambled. hate that they tore down old high-limit room; now its more ""high-tech"" looking and cant seem to ever win anymore. Used to have this garden-like high limit room that was quaint and cool. Now it sucks.
Best part is the food choices. They have casual fast food like a diner upstairs right next to the arcade, pizza and a deli near the cool cobblestone walk path, as well as other quick bites. Mexcian restaurant is quite good (forgot name) oh, Gonzalez Y Gonzalez there u go.
Arcade is so-so...usual ripoff rigged low ticket-giving games, and shitty prizes. They dont have good maintenace on a lot of games, and a lot are outdated big time.
Seems whichever room I get, always hear the stupid roller coaster rumbling and rattling through the night. Buyer B-Ware.
Il fornaio has awesome pizzas, and the cafe immediately to the left which is little fornaio has the best breakfast value and quick meal this side of McD's. They make grilled cheese toast, or with a croissant, with ham or without. Their ham always smells like ass so I order cheese only. Free pitchers of tap water too.
Check-in is a pain in the ass unless you VIP, but nothing compared to Caesars.
Treated in laws to zumanity show, they were disturbed yet impressed.

America is worst restuarant here, gallaghers steakhouse good but very expensive, and to be honest, you can pick a better rib-eye at costco than the ones they serve here.

They have a nice area with fast food type shit like pizza and deli sandwiches. 
Chis or whatever the chinese place is aint all that...tried once very forgetable, panda express might even battle with it so save your money here at least.

I wanted to stay at MGM because that's where the show was and I thought it would be more convenient to just walk downstairs to the show, but it was too expensive. I found a deal online for a spa suite here, and figured why not. I'd only be in the room and at the concert, so might as well get a room I'll enjoy.

First, upon early check in which is at 1pm, they did try and tell me the room wasn't ready and that they couldn't guarantee it would be till possibly even 4pm. This must be an MGM resort ""thing"" because I experienced the same problem at Mirage. However, this visit, I wasn't going to accept that. I needed to be at MGM early for the concert and needed time to get ready. I expressed this to the clerk and she took the time to call housekeeping and find a room that was ready. Housekeeping confirmed there was a spa suite ready and I was sent on my way.

What can I say, my jaw dropped when I walked in. The room was absolutely huge, I believe they describe it as 500 square feet but let me tell you it felt bigger than my first apartment. I didn't have a strip view, but I did have a view of the pool and part of the rollercoaster. Contrary to what others have said, the noise from the coaster isn't that bad. I did hear faint screams from riders but they stop the coaster at a decent time. By the time the concert was over and I was back in my room, it wasn't running anymore. The bed was super comfy, the pillows were fluffy, and the spa was awesome. I relaxed before and after the show and watched TV from the spa. 

I'm more of a Venetian girl and tend to stay there when in Vegas, but I would absolutely stay here again if I needed a more affordable option.

As for the casino, there was a big jerk working at the center bar, Vincent or something.  He talked down to all the customers he waited on, including us.  So avoid him if you go there.  

We are part of the players club, and although, for us, I thought we spent quite a lot of money, we only got $8 back toward our room bill from all our slot play and things we charged to the room.

We enjoyed an 8 hour drive due to major sand storms in the Mojave desert that almost doubled the travel time. Fortunately, we communicate well, so it wasn't too torturous.

I've visited this property numerous times, primarily for the gaming & steakhouse, so I felt that this property was a good selection for his first visit for a variety of reasons, including the fact that only a short stroll is needed to find additional venues for eating, drinking, & being merry and it's only a short walk away from the must-see MGM. 

We enjoyed an awesome dinner at Gallagher's, including vodka martinis, red wine, a prime NY steak & lamb chops, both bloody as hell, top quality, & delicious.

In the Brooklyn section of the property, we enjoyed pizza loaded with the wonders of the meat-loving universe!

We also visited the Coyote Ugly bar, a small, hot, stuffy drinking establishment that was MC'd by a loud, skanky little girl that would benefit from charm school.

Three things I do not like and try to avoid.  If given the choice between vacation in Las Vegas and no vacation, I would most likely choose no vacation and just take those vacation days as an opportunity to do some laundry.  Thrilling, I know. 

On to New York, New York.  If forced to take a vacation to Las Vegas, I could stay here and never leave and feel completely okay about that.  

I have stayed here twice.  The rooms are standard hotel rooms but just steps away are some really cool time consuming activities. Okay, these things are technically a lot of steps away since Vegas hotels are built all maze-y and confusing to keep people stuck inside to spend more money.

Coyote Ugly is fun in a ""I saw the movie and can totally do that"" sort of way.  I love any place that actually encourages my friends and I to dance on their bar.  

The dueling piano bar is great if you are there will a smaller group and want to laugh your booty off.  Get there early if you want to find a seat and be ready to spend a large portion of your evening there.

The good:
-Prime real estate. You are right in the center of the strip. Not too far South, not too far North. You're within walking distance of Monte Carlo, Excalibur, Aria, etc.
-Cheap food. NY-NY has the greatest selection of cheap and good restaurants. Try out Greenbergs Deli (my personal fave), Sirrico's Pizza, Fulton Fish Market, New York Pretzel and Gonzalez y Gonzalez. All great locations and you can get cheap food. When we stayed at the Aria which had absolutely NO cheap food, we found ourselves at NY-NY almost every meal.
-Some decent bars. The piano bar was pretty fun to kill a few hours and free to get in and the Nine Fine Irishmen had entertainment too. I highly recommend the beer & cheese dip from Nine Fine Irishmen if you're looking for a quick bite. The rest of the food was just okay for me.
-Rooms aren't fancy, but with all of these other perks, I don't need fancy.
-Good pillow allotment. Yes, this is very important to me. 
-Room rate was hella cheap AND I got free tickets to Zarkana included. In fact, the people next to us at the show paid more for their two tickets to the show than I did the entire 2 night stay there. (Make sure to sign up for any of the MLife properties email list because they do this frequently.) 

The meh:
-One complaint about Vegas is that you're constantly being marketed to. Whether it's the guy on the street handing you his music or the people trying to get you to visit their properties, it's enough to make someone go bat sh*t crazy. The ONE safe place has always been my hotel room to escape from these people. WHY OH WHY has NY-NY taken advantage of me by putting advertisements on the mirrors and in the bathroom? I hated that part and had to resist ripping it off and throwing the spa advertisements away.
-Our room was away from the elevator and it turns out we had one of the last rooms. I guess I was spoiled by Mandalay, where there's 3 hallways and u just have to walk down one hallway to find your room, but at NY-NY you are just walking foreverrrr to get to your room. It's not horrible, but it did get a little annoying if we forgot something and wanted to run back up really quickly. Next time, I'd ask for one near the elevator.
-The deal we booked said we'd get a BOGO coupon for the rollercoaster. We got no coupons or any deals with our room key. Not a deal breaker since the room rate was phenomenal but I decided not to ride the coaster since I didn't get my coupon. 

The bad:
-My back hurt after sleeping on these beds. After the 2nd night of sleeping on it, I felt crippled and could barely walk. Maybe it was a combination of sleeping in hotel beds for 7 nights straight, but all I know is that it sucked. I think I'd give NY-NY another chance though because there's so many other things I love about it and I'm hoping it was just that particular bed.
-Resort fee. Yeah, I already knew about it before I went, but I still don't like them and you can't make me.

All in all, we still love this hotel and would give it another go when we go back to Vegas. If you decide not to book NY-NY, at least make sure to stop at Greenbergs for one of their amazing sandwiches.",2,2,0

I must say that I was impressed with the hotel in a way I didn't expect. But I still don't like this part of the Strip. 

We arrived around 6:30pm on a Friday and I expected a long wait at check in. But...there wasn't. We had our keys within 5 minutes or so. We had two Park Avenue (base) rooms, and one Madison Avenue room. 

Park Avenue - Small but comfortable. The bathroom was large enough, and the beds were comfortable. Everything was very clean, the TVs were nice and had plenty of channels. 

Madison Avenue - On a corner overlooking the Strip and the airport (great, because I'm an aviation nerd). There was more room, but also an annoying column that was randomly placed and took up park of it. There were plenty of windows, a large bathroom, two comfy beds. 

Food options are good, and mostly on the affordable side. I recommend the Greenberg's Deli or the Broadway Burger place. Also Nathan's which is quick and cheap. Bar wise, Nine Fine Irishmen is a blast. Pour 24 is okay. Coyote Ugly is a great place to get a to-go frozen beverage for the road, but I have no desire to actually go inside.

Since my wife likes to feed money to the machines, the players club likes us and gives us discounted rooms - so the value is pretty outstanding on a per night basis. That is, of course, if you discount the money that then disappears into said machines which make the players club like us so much. :) 

Rooms are OK, a bit of cigarette funk seems to invade the nonsmoking rooms despite their being non smoking rooms. 

I like the blackjack games they have downstairs, the rules are some of the best in Vegas (unless you can afford to play $50 minimum double deck games at the Mirage). Of course this is probably because its one of the MGM properties - I generally won't set foot into one of the Harrahs properties for my gambling endeavors. They're just over the top greedy. :) 

The hotel is sort of showing its years - some of the rooms are definitely better than others. 

I'm a food snob, so I have to say that if you're looking for top end chow, this isn't the place. Gallaghers has some nice steak, but can be pricey. Nine Fine Irishmen was OK, and Il Fornaio has been very hit or miss for us - mainly in the service department. Though if you're a Los Angeles weekend driver like we are, their sandwich bar next door is a great place to get road food before making the trek back home. 

Overall, a pretty good value for the dollar and a good location on the strip - not too far in terms of walking distance to the fountains, plus you can make it over to MGM or Mandalay if it suits you with only a short walk.

We stayed at New York, New York Hotel and Casino on this Vegas Trip. On the night that we had arrived, the winds were extremely strong.  I took about 5 minutes for someone to come to our Vehicle from bell services while we were standing in what seemed like hurricane strength winds.

Arriving inside, we had no trouble with our room, considering it was 15 minutes until Midnight (we were on the verge of loosing our reservation due to heavy traffic on the I-15 from L.A.).  Once in our room, we wanted something cold to drink and we noticed there was no Mini Fridge in the room.  Bell Services arrived about 10 minutes after we were in our room with our bags from the car earlier...service here was faster than what it was at the Valet.  

On our 2nd day were were out most of the day with our Vegas out of town Family, so we didn't spend much time at the hotel enough to continue this review

Day 3, I left to run  a few errands and my wife had decided to order room service, but we had no Menu in our room, so after I had come back a few hours later we decided to go eat at the America restaurant down stairs, instead.

Over all, our stay here was great and I would not mind spending another Vegas trip here...considering I never got to ride the Roller Coaster.",1,0,0

Completely different experience. It started off bad in Valet. We were in line for the valet. We had already gotten out of our car and was getting our stuff out. (We were next in line) The next thing we know is one of the valet guys moved the cone for the other lane to open it. He told us to move our car over there. There was no way this was going to happen because we were already blocked in with other cars behind us and now people were pulling over to that lane also. We told him it was obvious we couldnt move and could he please take our car from where it was because we were next in line. He said no and if we didnt move to that lane then we could just wait until he had time to come back to that lane. He had all of the attitude to go along with that statement. My husband and I just looked at each other because we could not believe he spoke to people like that. We waited, but just to get out of line and find the parking garage. We usually self park any way, but my husband had hurt his back so valet would have been convenient. We went in to check in. After the check in process was completed, we asked to speak with management about the valet incident. She called for management and said they would be there soon.

For those who don't know, accessible rooms are generally for disabled persons. This meant that the bathrooms had railings, there was no bathtub in the restroom -- just a shower, the shower has a foldable seat, and the shower floor is level with the rest of the bathroom floor. This spelled disaster when I tried to shower. 

First, the shower head was in the middle, so it faced the middle of the bathroom. I think they should have had it on the side, but I understand that most people who would stay in these rooms would just take the shower head off its hook. Second, the bathroom floor flooded because the entire bathroom floor was level. We ended up having to switch out of that room into a regular room.

Now, all is fine, right? Well, it would have been if we hadn't been missing a few things in the room. Both the tv remote and do not disturb signs were not there. Minor problems for some, but very important for us since we knew we'd be sleeping late and didn't want housekeeping to disturb us, and the remote is obvious. 

While we had some problems with our rooms, there are many things about NY NY that are good. We enjoyed the roller coaster (although my husband said it was a little slow). The location is good, and parking was quite easy to find most of the time. Service for the most part was good minus a blip during checkout when the guy told me I had more Freeplay than what the Players Club gave me.

The fact that this hotel is on the strip and NOT considered a low budget cheesy hotel in Las Vegas and part of a decent chain of hotels AND priced much higher than any off the strip budget hotel. You definitely expect MORE.... SUCH A LET DOWN!! First off entering the hotel from the parking garage the elevators are SO confusing. (Even an employee of the hotel had a hard time) The elevator buttons are not labeled, so you are guessing which floor to get off on to get to the hotel entrance floor. Once in the hotel (from parking garage) you are in the gaming\/arcade\/kid zone area. Trying to navigate to find the ""check in"" desk from that area there are no signs for the elevators. There is an escalator... but when you have all your luggage and escalator is NOT going to work. OK so bottom line navigating your way WITH VERY LITTLE SIGNAGE POSTED was difficult. Elevators not clear as to what floor is CASINO or ROOMS...?? Leaves you guessing and frustrated!!! NOW THE ROOM: We booked 2 Queen bed room. It was 3 of us. My mom, sister , and me. This room was SO CRAMPED!! There is this huge wardrobe\/TV\/hutch that takes up almost 1 entire wall. So this thing is to be used as dresser, closet, TV Stand. So there was no other closet in the room. Each of the beds is basically again the wall on either side.  No desk. A chair crammed in a corner, basically useless because it's right between the huge multi purpose wardrobe piece and 1 of the beds.  OK so ROOM: SMALL and NOT comfortably functional.  The TV was intermittent, barely any channels and the channels that were available were not clear and would go out!! Not whole lot of time watching TV but it should be an option. No fridge in the room. No glasses. Not even plastic cups!! We had to go to Walgreens to buy plastic cups. When I called to ask for a couple of cups, I was told it would be $5\/ cup. AN EMPTY CUP!! REALLY???? Looking back I should have ordered a soda from room Service for $8 and used that cup.  No coffee maker. Could not heat up water for tea.  Even HOLIDAY INN offers that complimentary. 
Hard for guests to navigate within the hotel\/elevators. 
VERY crammed room accommodations. 
NO common amenities available (unless you want to pay)
WIFI in rooms was terrible to non existent (probably why the TV reception was soo bad)
Bottom line for the price you pay NOT WORTH IT!! 
Better accommodations at HOLIDAY INN.

After walking around for about an hour and a half, we walked up the front desk to check in, and even though check in time was around 2, they let us in at about 12:30pm. Rooms are separated into different buildings so you have to take a specific set of elevators to your room. We got the corner room in the Chrysler building on the 27th floor, facing away from the strip towards the mountains and the Monte Carlo Hotel. Room was pretty standard, and the beds were very comfortable. We asked for a cot and more fresh towels, all of which they brought up right away. My only qualm with the room was the bathroom didn't have a fan, and also the water pressure was extremely weak in the sink and the shower. Other than that, it was all pretty nice, clean, and comfortable. 

This is an excellent hotel and casino to vacation at if your with kids, or with friends, or just looking for a great deal overall. This hotel isn't the Ritz so if your looking for sheer classy and elegance, a place like the Aria or Bellagio might be your place, but it is still a nice, fun place with a lot of character to it. 


PROS
*Price - Compared to the other prices for hotels, you can't beat the price. A much cheaper price than anywhere else, yet the rooms, atmosphere, and everything else was fantastic. The best bang for your buck on the Las Vegas Strip for sure. Only con on the price was the 'Resort Fee'. Basically, you have to pay it anyway, so why not just include that in the original price. It's a little deceiving, but all of the MGM properties do that. 

*Food Options - We ate at the Broadway Burger Bar and got some other random food there like a slice of pizza, but there was so much more that we could have eaten. The options there are incredible, and lots of places to choose from. The Burger was was reasonably priced and good food. The slice of sicilian pizza was good, but $6 a slice!

*Casino Options - One of the much smaller casinos on the strip that I saw, but they have lower table limits like $5 Blackjack which many hotels do not offer. I also liked the layout of the casino how it was more of an open air atrium like Paris had, as supposed to low ceilings that almost every other casino has. Maybe it was a bit of a dead week, but they didn't have as many table games open as they could have. 
 
*Service - Everyone was extremely friendly from the wait staff, to the maids who cleaned the room. Every single time we ask for something (towels, soap, cot, etc.) they brought it up right away and were very nice about everything. We also met a host on the floor who gave us our mLife Cards right there and helped us out with advice.


CONS
*Location - More towards the south of the strip, but still not a bad walk if you want to travel to other surrounding casinos.",1,0,1

There are really only a few reasons why I have or would ever stop by for a visit to the NYNY and the following are:

Zumanity (Cirque Du Soleil show)

Tom's Urban (Restaurant)

Hershey World (Only to take my tourist friends)

I have stayed in a room once in the past and was not impressed compared to all of the other better options for lodging that Las Vegas offers.

Valet parking is a plus here though as it is super easy to access the hotel to get in and out.

The casino is small and dark, they have some decent quick bite options and a good pizza & pasta joint called New York Pizzeria which is open 24\/7. I would not make a special trip to eat here however if at the NYNY and in the mood for pizza I would. They sell whole pizzas, stuffed pizzas, pizza by the slice, Stromboli's, calzones, salads, etc.

There is just not enough going on at the NYNY to keep me there or coming back. 

That don't impress me much!",8,4,7

Check in: Was not that long of a line when i came, but this hotel is busy so expect long lines around check in time.

Room: The room was nice, had a unique layout and I felt the bed was very comfortable to sleep in. The bathroom was very large and the shower head had 3 different settings which i found to be an enjoyable feature.

Pool: NYNY has ALWAYS had the perfect pool water temperature the only word i can think of to describe the water temperature is 'beautiful'. The pool deck was hot.....but definitely not as hot as other hotels thanks to the buildings and garages surrounding it.

Service: My keys got demagnetized & wouldnt work and 99% of hotels in town will send Security up, verify your identity and let you in sparing you the front desk line again....However some Security person on the phone named ""Corey"" (Graveyard) bltantly refused to send someone up to assist me and displayed quite a condescending attitude over the phone until I reminded him that i could make a phone call to his director to find out why assisting me would be a problem. I went to the desk, got my own keys and mysteriously Security arrived when i got back in which i thanked him & told him i had resolved it myself per 'Corey'. The front desk agent i spoke with laughed with me and stated Security is rude to them alot too.....lol

Spacious, clean rooms, well stocked bathroom and updated decor grace this hotel so I am never disappointed in my stay here.

If you're craving a slice of pizza, they have a spot open til the wee hours of the night or you can hang out a the Bar at Times Square and watch the dueling pianos belt out crowd pleasing tunes. I'll usually do both. Grab a slice of pie and watch the show unfold from seating outside. Kill two birds with one stone! They also have a Coyote Ugly bar if you wanna kick up your heels and potentially leave your bra hanging from the ceiling for good measure after you've had one too many.

We were there for 5 nights and stayed at the Century Tower on the 22nd floor. The only complaint was that we were in room 2279 and it was such a long walk from the elevators. Also, when I booked it, we were supposed to be given a king sized bed. As you can see from the photo that it wasn't. I specifically told the guy at the front desk, when we checked in, that it was supposed to be a king sized bed. I even showed him the itinerary. I was disappointed to see that it wasn't when we walked into the room. However, the room was nice and we didn't feel like going back downstairs, and standing in that line for another room. There is a $29.00 a day resort fee and a 12% tax for $3.48 a day.

The hotel was built to resemble the New York skyline. The have replicas of the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. There's also a replica of the Statue of Liberty and a roller coaster on the hotel premises. If you ever stay at this hotel, park on the 3rd floor. Drive around and park closest to the hotel entry to the lobby. 

This hotel is home to the Shake Shack, Tom Urban, America, and a bunch of other eateries. It's also home to Hershey's Chocolate World. They have this huge Statue of Liberty that's made out of chocolate.

I really liked walking through Greenwich Village. The facade of the buildings are just like New York. They have a bunch of eateries there. 48th and Crepe, and Fulton Fish Frye, were 2 that we tried. I also wanted to try the bakery there, but didn't have time for it. 

The housekeepers were so friendly. They would say good morning to us, every morning, when they saw us. Check out was really easy. The hotel sent this email, where you could just do it on your phone. They also have these independent check out centers where you just enter your info and you're done.",13,2,6

Room was clean, nothing fancy. It was a Madison room. No fridge or microwave. Probably best to go with the basoc room and try a $20 sandwich up check in and ask for a complimentary upgrade.
At first the main floor gaming and food areas are a bit overwhelming, but once you get the hang of it is all good.
The Times Square Bar has dueling pianos nightly. They charge a cover after a certain time, but the music can be heard (loudly) from outside. You can grab a slice of pizza and a beer for $7.77 next door and listen for free. The times square bar also has video poker at the bar. Put in $20 and slowly play the 25 cent game. Bartender said you have to start with $20 to get free drinks (don't have to play it all though).
Plenty of restaurants inside. Il Fornio had 2 for 1 breakfast entrees with a decent selection for around $10.
Starbucks has small coffee for $3.50.
Beers to buy anywhere inside are around $10. There is a CVS about 5 min walk North. Go there and stock up if you don't plan to gamble consistently. The shop in NYNY is super expensive.
There is a slushy bar inside. You can buy a glass and get discounted refills (still not cheap).
There are at least 2 $5 blackjack tables at all times, but are pretty packed at night. I never saw a craps table less than $10. Take the attached crosswalk to Excalibur for $5 craps and a much better sports book. The sports book at NYNY is pathetic, but serves the purpose of being able to place bets.

We requested a non-smoking room specifically due to my sensitivity to cigarette smoke.  When we arrived in our room, I was extremely upset.

The first thing we noticed was that there were two ashtrays on the table next to the door.  One of these ashtrays still had cigarette ash in it.  We also were hit by the waft of stale smoke smell from the room.  My gut reaction was, ""Oh great, they gave us a smoking room.""  However, upon moving further into the room, we saw the advertised no smoking signs with associated fine for smoking in the room.

I immediately called the front desk to express my concern.  The first concern was my discomfort, followed very closely by the desire to not be charged for smoking in the room because of the evidence left by the previous guests.  The front desk's only solution was to send someone up to ""freshen"" the room.  

In addition to the ash trays, we were also greeted by what appeared to be a heavy duty fan of some sort.  When the bellman delivered our bags, he expressed extreme concern as this was no ordinary fan, but was a machine that, if it had been running, would have been harmful to our health.  Luckily, housekeeping was already on their way to attempt to cover up the smoking smell so the bellman didn't have to call to have this item removed.

When housekeeping arrived, they pulled out an air freshening spray to assist with the smell.  This simply provided a different strong smell, which didn't last.  Over the three day stay, the smell of smoke lingered and was noticeable even on our clothing that we had not worn when we returned home.

Finally, when we had started to unpack, we opened the mini fridge and discovered leftover food from the previous guests.

There is an added price to just about everything they sell. If you buy a Starbucks coffee, expect to pay another dollar per cup. If you want to use the Internet in your hotel room, you pay 15.00 a day extra resort fee. The resort fee is suppose to give you access to the fitness center and hot tube, which were closed for maintenance during the time I stayed there, so I think this is a complete rip off. I think for $150 a night, the extra nickel and dimming fees are a crappy way to treat the customer.  

The night clubs and entertainment stink at this place, Rok is a crappy club and Coyote Ugly Saloon is all hype and no real entertainment. 

I stayed two nights in a hotel room that was considered to be an upgraded room. The hotel was clean and organized.

We tried to enjoy the Super Bowl with some friends in our room but our cable would keep glitching so we got frustrated and turned it off. Also our last night here we tried to just go to the room early and watch tv before bed but again we're unable to.

The casino and the hotel as a whole is very hard to navigate, especially with a few drinks in you. Each historic tower of New York City, which has been reincarnated are the rooms that make up the hotel. However, unlike most hotels where the elevators for each section of the hotel are close together, the elevators at this hotel are spread out. 

The rooms themselves are a little awkward, the normal rooms are a bit small. There were two of us in our room and sometimes when we walked past the bed closet to the window, one of us sometimes would scrap or bang our knee into the entertainment center. Ironically the bathroom in the room was huge and very nice. It almost seemed that the money was spent on the bathroom and not on the rooms. The standard rooms are best suited for a one-person party or a couple's weekend. 

I have stayed in what is known as the Broadway Deluxe room that is a little bit larger, I would recommend spending the extra money to have a more comfortable room. 

The customer service, however, is very helpful. I receive offers from the resort on what seems like a weekly basis and it is nice when you call them that they will go over all of the offers with you and let you know which offer is the best.  

The pool is not very large and the roller coaster goes above it so if you are bothered by noise, it could bother you.  But one thing that I did like at the pool was that the cabanas are only around $100, which is a good deal. 

The casino itself is large and offers a wide range of games. I am a blackjack player and have really never done well at NYNY nor know anyone who has ever done well. Once in a while you get a good game of Craps, but that is about it. However, if you plan to do any gambling there, I strongly suggest the sports book. 

The restaurants at the resort at mediocre at best and can be downright bad. Gonzalez Y Gonzalez made half of my party sick. The ESPN zone is like any other sports bar that has mediocre food. Nathan's is not bad but you know what you are getting. 

The nightlife with Coyote Ugly is fun but the venue itself is small and when it gets crowded, you may not have any room to breathe. Rok is fun if you are a fan of rock music, which I am so I enjoyed the place more. But be prepared to pay, even girls, at the door.   

I also do not like valet parking system they have, instead of giving your ticket to a person, you check in at a machine and more than once that the machine lose my parking ticket and had to wait up to 45 minutes to get my car back. 

Overall, it is not the worst place to stay in Vegas, but it is for sure not the best.",0,0,0

When I saw pictures of the exterior, I always thought ""cheesy"".  When I saw it in person, I thought ""cheesier"".  If I would have booked a room, I might have thought ""cheesiest"", but I'll leave that to people who did sleep here.

I love roller coasters, so I planned to go on this one.  Then I got to the entrance, and found that it's $14\/ride.  That is beyond steep.  I didn't ride.  My coworker, who was also in Vegas at the time, told me that she did ride it a while back, and it's so rough and throws you back and forth so much that it hurts.  At my advanced age (I've been 29 for many years now), I don't feel like booking a chiropractor after riding a roller coaster.

Now for the good:  The Hersheys store.  Like World Of Coca-Cola and the M&Ms store, this one is overpriced.  But you can get a Hershey bar customized with your name on it.  And it has a chocolate Statue of Liberty at the inside entrance;  cool.

Could use slight updates. We had a room by the roller coaster. I would not suggest that area to anyone. The ride came around quite often an ran until 11 or 12. The roller coaster itself was loud enough but all the screaming put the noise level over the top. The hallways to get to your rooms goes on and on and on like a never ending maze. There are adequate elevators though so you shouldn't need to wait more than a minute for one.

The casino area was the perfect size, not too big not too small. Makes it easy to find  one another if you prefer different areas. There is a hood variety of slots. There are also table games.

The area surrounding the casino is very fun. There are mock city streets with a pub, pizza parlor and several other eateries. Except for the casino noise, you would feel like you were strolling through a neighborhood. 

One side of the casino is open to several stores and a bar. The ""I Love New York"" is great for forgotten items and souvenirs. There prices are on point or lower than similar stores in the area.

After a couple weeks of on-again, off-again digging for cheap prices, I came to the conclusion that NY NY was a good option for me. Although Paris seemed to brag about not having a resort fee and NY NY has a $20 daily fee, I was still able to save ~$40 a night by staying here. After talking to a fellow conference goer, I found Paris charged extra for internet access anyway, so the wifi included in NY NY's fee made the deal even sweeter. The fee also included use of the fitness center and the ability to print out your boarding pass in the hotel's business center - be sure you have your confirmation number with you.

Overall, I was very pleased with the space. I was given a basic ""Premier"" room with two queen beds - meh, I don't need a king - on the 14th floor in the ""New York Tower,"" with a view of the roller coaster. I found the bathroom to be quite large and stocked well with towels. There is no desk in the Premier room, so if you need one, you'll need to obtain a more expensive unit. No refrigerator, microwave, or coffee maker. I did use the ice bucket to keep my yogurt chilled, which worked well for me.

Not having been to Vegas for 10 years, I was surprised at how much the Strip had changed. Remembering the major pain it was to cross the street way-back-when, I did a happy dance when i saw there was a pedestrian walkway from the mezzanine level across the Strip toward the MGM Grand. From there, it was a 10-30-minute walk to Paris. ""A 20-minute difference,"" you ask? Yes, 10-30 minutes. A 10-minute walk at 6:30am if you walk fast, but otherwise, if you need to get anywhere quickly during the day, forget about it, unless you're assertive\/borderline aggressive. There are just too many slow, alcohol-infused bodies.

NY NY offers express checkout, perhaps predictable since establishments in towns 1\/10 the size of Vegas often do so, as well. Because my workplace is partially reimbursing me for this trip, and because I work for the state government, I had to go through the traditional checkout process for paperwork reasons. Front desk staff, as they were at check-in, were friendly and helpful. My only issue with NY NY was that, upon asking where I could pick up a shuttle to the airport, a staff person said I needed to call in advance. Um...what? In Vegas?? When the airport is such a short distance away and there are a bazillion people coming and going at all times? Sheesh. When I picked up the house phone to make a reservation, the operator connected me to a shuttle company that didn't come for me on time. Luckily I was able to get to the airport via another shuttle service. So, if you're making reservations in advance, you may want to clarify the shuttle issue--unless, of course, you win big and score a limo.",1,0,1

+Friendly employees
+Self Parking had spaces right by the bridge to the entrance

IN BETWEEN:
-\/+ Craps dealers lack personality.  They're friendly and professional, but they've got no soul.  Made for some lame action... especially considering I was winning.
-\/+ The ice machine in the room didn't make ice....made a decent fridge though.

-Rooms are clean, but the furniture seems like it's in need of renovation.
-Obstucted views in the center of the Empire State Building

-CRT TVs...

Pros
1) We had a good sized room with amazing views of the strip, but we were in a corner room so thats probably why
2) Was clean and classy without trying to be too swanky. Its Vegas after all...cheesy and cheap reign here
3) The staff were very helpful in trying to make my friends birthday a memorable one
4) My friend won $800 on the nickel slots

Cons
1) DESIGN!!! who ever designed this sucks. You could hear the rollercoaster in our room which is not exactly welcoming when its 9 am, you went to bed at 4 am, and are a little hung over. Actually, its really really really annoying. AND the rollercoaster goes right over the pool area. I like to relax and zone out by the pool, which is hard to do with screaming people going over you every few people. 
2) Speaking of the pool....I was underwhelmed. Really generic and small. 
3) Needs better night clubs. Coyote Ugly is the only option, and believe me, you'll pass on that!

A friend in another room was smart and brought a small 2 cup coffee maker - I will do that next time.

The upstairs attraction is the Coyote Ugly bar which can get crowded quickly and seems to turn into a mess of young people - not exactly one of the more better established bar\/clubs that are on the vegas strip but it has been a staple to the New York New York for about 10 years or so.

I have never had much luck in the casino here - not sure if its what I was playing but I have seen winners come out of this place so it may be a place to try if you feel like bank rolling some of the table games.

Being in vegas does not mean you have to gamble, drink, and party. Heck, i'm 21. It was my first time in Vegas & I truly had a blast. I think it was because being in our suite made things feel so relaxing. Can't wait to go back to the New York New York again!

BTW, we also had a special deal with our hotel room purchase. We received a free buffet for the 2 of us at any of the participating hotels :D",3,0,1

Location: 
Very south - be warned you will be walking a lot unless you're heading to the adjacent hotels. Having said that, you're very close to the MGM Grand, which is the largest hotel on the Strip.

Rooms:
We had a Player's Suite on the 24th floor. The suite is a great size and layout, good for entertaining the other people that came down with us. The bed was comfortable, and the room had great black-out shades. The room is EXTREMELY outdated, I was shocked this hotel wasn't built in the 60s. Paint was peeling off everyone, furniture was old and stripped, bathroom fixtures barely worked because they were so old. Also, (and I know this is a small thing) the television cable package is an absolute joke. I'm a bit confused why all MGM properties wouldn't have the same? Room service was great, always cleaned our room (REMEMBER TO TIP YOUR ROOM ATTENDANTS PEOPLE...  :))

Restaurants:
Not much in the fine dining category, but definitely great late-night eateries. Lots of them. Also, no real lounge or club on site. There is a Coyote Ugly, but be warned it's very small.

Casino:
Has all the standards you would need for some gambling. I found the drink service at this MGM property to be quite sub-par compared to Aria, Mirage, Bellagio or even Monte Carlo. Still though, the Casino isn't bad by any means.

Overall: it was a good value for the price, which is one of the other reasons it gets 4 stars.",1,0,1

   Owing to the fact that NY-NY featured a Memorial to the victims of 9\/11 by the Statue of Liberty up to 2013, it is appropriate that this is going to be my review 911. Likewise owing to the facts that my family and I vacationed there for a week in March and that it is frequent spot to hang out at, the time has come to review New York-New York.

   New York-New York and the real New York share something else besides landmarks. Both are exciting and have Pizzazz!  

  The first time I ever set eyes on New York-New York was on a summer afternoon back in July 1996 when the MGM was the hot new property on the Strip. Because it was being built, I couldn't set foot in it. The next year when we returned to Las Vegas, it was my first time in the casino. Nearly 20 years later, the property has not aged. The thing about theme casinos that some bean executives just don't understand is that a great theme never gets old. Additionally fantastic themes are so exciting that it puts the reviewer at a disadvantage of streamlining to avoid the character limit. For that reason this review from this point forward separates it by category. 

Hotel Rooms:

  Our hotel room up in the Columbia Tower was clean and comfortable. The neat thing about the theme is that the towers resemble the New York skyline. Because my dad paid for it the few things I could say about pricing is that it is competitively priced before the resort fee. The view from the room overlooked the Statue of Liberty and southeast Valley. The roller coaster would careen up and down the track outside the tower. 

Drinking:

   The coffee fan in me appreciates that it is easy to savor the beverage. By registration, Fornaio serves a delicious Cafe Americano and desserts. There are two Starbuck's with one that has seats overlooking the Brooklyn Bridge. 

  The alcohol fan in me appreciates the variety of bars. There is the Irish Bar near the Strip. Upstairs for a different drinking environment is Coyote Ugly. In the casino is a central bar and sporadic cocktail service at the slot machines. The pizza place has a $7.77 special including 2 slices and beer. The Times Square Bar is a fun spot for a cold one while listing to Dueling Piano players duel it out. 

Dining:

   There is a nice choice of places to eat. The themed streets of Greenwich Village are a unique spot to enjoy a bite while taking in the attention that is so detailed that steam rises out of a manhole replica on the walkway. The restaurants include a fish & chips place, a crepe stand, Greenberg's Deli, Chinese restaurant, hot dog stand, Broadway Burger and pizza place. Way out in Coney Island there is a Nathan's that is the only one to serve super cheeseburgers on the Strip. Near the hotel registration America is the casino cafe. Upstairs in the menazzaine the restaurants include a pizzeria and Haagan Daez. Out in the suburbs are Tom Urban and Shake Shack. 

Entertainment :

   The theme is the major entertainment. It makes this a unique place that is unparalleled at a New York theme. Before I step foot in the casino, there is the New York skyline, Statue of Liberty, and the Brooklyn Bridge. The theme continues inside. Even Hershey's World gets in the New York mood with a towering chocolate Statue of Liberty. There has been some detheming in the Central Park casino where the trees have been replaced with contemporary furnishings. This causes the eye to look across the casino to the perimeter. Usually my eyes lead me to Greenwich Village. At night the sounds of the Times Square Dueling Piano Bar bounce across the Village. Throughout the day and night the New York roller coaster cars fly along the tracks above. Above Times Square there is entertainment to be had in the Coney Island arcade. In back of the hotel, there is a resort swimming pool that overlooks the roller coaster and Monte Carlo. The hotel us also the home of the Cirque Du Soleil show: Zumanity. The entertainment got even better with the newly opened Park connecting the casino to the T-Mobile Arena. 

Conclusion:

   New York-New York is the quintessential proof that well-run  properties with fantastic themes never get old. They remain exciting places that never get boring. Fantastic themed hotels in comparison to hotels that try to be hip or overluxurious alleviate the negative energy of paying to park, obnoxious resort fees, and other expenses. New York - New York puts me in a New York State of Mind.",11,4,9

Friendly staff, good coupons, good shows and a good variety of places to eat.  

The pool tends to get crowded, so you have to show up early to get a seat because they are first come first serve. When we finally made it down to the pool with decent seats, we walked away for a few mintues to get a drink only to come back to our stuff moved to another chair by 4 old cougars....apparantly they ""went to the bathroom to change"" but didnt leave anything on the seats to let people know it was occupied. I decided to be a lady and let them be since they were bitters old women anyway! ahahahaha. But if your willing, you can fight for your chairs cause it was hell finding seats after that! Luckilly the lifegaurd was really friendly and helped us find seats:)

We also we to ROK vegas which was only ok because of the music (and music video playing on a huge panoramic screen) and me being drunk! Crowd sucked. They were lame and alot of people didnt dance... (uh?). There were also older people there too. wtf! lol If you happen to be walking around the casino there will be promoters giving away free entrance to ladies and reduced for guys ($10)

1. They have an arcade and roller coaster for the kids .. Well the crap thing is they don't tell you height for the roller coaster so after having bought tickets for it we get up there and he's too short so yeah have the damn measurements out FRONT!
2. Different variety of food .. Pretty decent but the americana sucks
3. Location the location is decent 
4. The gambling was good
5. Front desk doesn't tell you what the ""deposit"" is for. 
There's a few other issues such as we had 2 rooms ... Credit card was linked to one but not the other... Dumb!!! So my mother had to go get cash to pay for room services at 10pm.

First of all when I booked the room I asked for a (non-smoking) King bedroom for me and my GF, but when we got there they told me they only had 2double rooms left. I let the check-in guy know that I had booked a king bed almost 2 months ahead of time, and he actually got annoyed with me and went on a spiel about how they don't guarantee anything when I book. After I started getting annoyed myself he finally told us we could have the wheelchair accessible room, which had a King sized bed, and the only difference was it had railings in the bathtub. Fine.

Also, 2 nights in a row, around 6pm we had hotel staff walk right into our room without knocking. Even though the room was already clean. We went straight down to the front desk and he let us know that sometimes management comes to inspect the rooms to ensure they've been cleaning properly. Thankfully it never happened again after that.


Pros
Very Cheap to Stay in
Nice sized room, very clean and big
Great View
Very comfy beds
Roller coaster didn't bother us with noise
Good selection of fast\/cheap food in the lobby
Fun but expensive piano bar in the lobby

This one isn't bad, but...I definitely enjoyed Venetian more (and I believe this place was only $50 less or so).

I liked this hotel in terms of accessibility. Compared to Venetian, this is the heart of The Strip. Since we depended on public transit, we wanted a hotel close to the express stops, and this was one of them. This hotel is also close to the airport express route, so I didn't need to transfer at South Strip (or take one of those unreliable hotel shuttles). I also liked the whole ""New York"" feel, but I only really felt it in the main floor, with the whole Little Italy\/Greenwich Village feel.

The rooms, for the price we paid, were decent at best. I can't complain much considering the beds were very comfy and everything went relatively smoothly in terms of checking in and out, and they even offer complimentary computer access for boarding pass printings! However the rooms were only about 40% the size of the Venetian rooms, and for $50 less I somewhat rather pay a bit more for a larger hotel.

The wifi was also quite weak sometimes. Without the ethernet plug, the speed felt like dialup at most times.

Check-in: there are about 6 people working and a huge like, took longer than expected. 

Room (Spa Suite): 
We changed rooms because as soon as we walked in to the room it smelled like smoke and it was a non-smoking floor.
Not very different than a regular room, a little bigger with a spa against the wall away from the window. The bathroom has a door for the toilet and shower but the sink part has no doors.
There is no fridge, no snacks and no drinks for purrchase in room. You have to order them through the phone.
The view was horrible, you'd think that the extra money would give you a better view...nope...both rooms had horrible views.
Super long hallways. If you're room number is in the beginning numbers such as 1605, 1610 expect to have a long walk. It took us 2 minutes to get to our room from the elevators. 2 minutes is nothing but walk at a normal pace for 2 minutes, it's a pretty good distance especially when drunk. Lol.

After waiting in line for 30 minutes, I nicely asked one of the employees [the guy taking pictures of the people on the roller coaster] if he can get me some water from the water dispenser they had. Mind you.... I could've easily grabbed some myself, but it had a big note that said EMPLOYEES ONLY! So, out of respect, I asked! He not only said NO! but was flat out rude about it! I had been coughing in line for almost an hour, and needed to drink something. He was a f@#$ing jerk... walked over to the dispenser, and served HIMSELF some water, and drank it in front of me.

The downstairs casino part of the hotel isn't very crowded and is easy to get around in. You never get all turned around and lost like some of the other hotels and the ceilings are high which helps to lessen the cigarette smoke.

I came to the New York New York one afternoon to have a few beers at their Pour 24 bar upstairs, which is actually quite nice and a great place to people watch! They have a Coyote Ugly Club\/Restaurant next to it, as well as a New York Pretzel place and a New York Pizza place which I never tried, but it's supposed to be really good.

What I did try was Shake Shack which is attached to the casino, but outside and downstairs. It's AMAZING. Definitely go if you have the chance! It gets crazy busy during lunch time, so definitely make sure to go on an off time to avoid the biggest rush. 

There is also a Nine Fine Irishman Pub (which is supposed to be good) and a Tom's Urban which I heard is OK. For shopping they have a Hershey's World Store which is interesting to look at, a Stupidiotic Store which is hilarious and also interesting to look around in, and a Swatch Store which really brought back the memories for me!

I have enjoyed the Mexican restaurant, the Jewish deli, Chin Chin Asian Fusion, and the frozen yummy drinks at the stands. No complaints on any of those restaurant trips. I especially enjoy the Chin Chin $13.95 breakfast buffet which comes with $1 mimosas at the bar! 

On top of that, NYNY has a particular casino game that you can't find in many other hotels -- I'm referring to the Roulette table that is a cross between real-life and virtual. A real ball spins and stops in the center of the table, meanwhile, you can play on the screen and not through a dealer. I think this is the wave of the future of roulette.

NYNY place seems to be at an intersection where I tend to linger around the Strip - by Excalibur, Luxor, MGM, Monte Carlo, and now Aria. It's also one of the closest Strip hotels nearby McCarran Airport. They'll hold you bags for free if you ever have a late night flight and need to check out earlier in the day!

The fitness room is a joke. All of the cardio machines were ancient and half of them were not in service. Small free weight area and a water cooler.

My first time playing slot machines in Vegas! I only lost $6! (From $23, haha.) Woohoo! 

This casino sticks to the cheesy NY-NY theme really well. Statue of Liberty outside, cool art deco art & structures, the restaurant area fashioned to look like streets...all in all, I was impressed with all the sights! Had some pizza, & Reuben sandwiches for dinner. Prices were ok, considering the area. There are some sit-down restaurants I'd consider trying in the future. We passed by a dueling piano bar that would be fun to hang out in - I always wonder how they remember all the songs! Also, they have a roller coaster upstairs in the ""Coney Island"" arcade! We didn't go on it, but I suspect it's expensive or has a long line. 

The casino part was pretty standard, but I don't know much about casinos or gambling. They all kind of look the same to me. Hourah Ghostbusters & Batman game though - high tech visuals & vibrating chairs! Hostess came by 3 times & each time we got our ""free"" drinks...got a bit hammered so I was having fun.

The location is great and right in the middle of town. If you're going to be there for a bit, buy a pass for the Monorail. It really pays off.

Coyote Ugly was fun for us, but the drinks pretty bad. We went in around 8'before going into Zumanity, and it was dead, but we got our hands stamped for free cover the rest of the night. We came back after the show, and it had livened up a little bit. The drinks were awful and expensive so we got drinks at the bar next door and went back.

Pros:
It was very easy to take the exit from the freeway onto Frank Sinatra Drive, and enter the parking structure of NYNY. I cannot believe that I did not have to drive on Las Vegas Blvd this trip. Easy walk to Aria, MGM, Excalibur etc.(+1)
A very busy arcade for kids\/youngsters. There were hundreds of kids the night we went to entertain Ian. Roller Coaster is also cool. (+1)
Lot of variety in dining. Pastrami at a Deli, Tacos at Gonzalez, Steak at Gallagher's, different kind of cuisine at Nine Fine Irishmen, Shake Shack, Bruxie's, etc.

I think we got a hotel for ~$120 a night (excluding resort fee which came to additional $35-40 a night) during a long weekend (independence day), so it wasn't too expensive. We were able to walk to other places on the strip or just cross over to other hotels like Excalibur or MGM to take a free tram or a paid monorail to other hotels\/places of interests.

The theme of this hotel is not high end by any means. It's casual and is reflected in the stores that the hotel offers. They don't have high end designer chef per se, but they have restaurants\/places that many want to try: e.g. shake shack, nathan's hot dogs, low-frill pizza places (that reminds me of pizzas on NY streets)..and hershey's.

She asked for advice, the dealer refused to give her any, and I helped her by explaining a particular aspect of basic blackjack strategy, as thousands of low-limit blackjack players do every single day across the country in casinos like this one. Secondly, since when do blackjack players belong to a dealer? I object heavily to the insinuation that I, or anyone else at the table, belonged to the dealer in any capacity. Thirdly, it's a $5 table, and a friendly one, not some high-roller table in the back. Relax, for crying out loud. Dealers are supposed to promote a good gambling atmosphere where guests have fun, and this one went out of his\/her way to destroy said atmosphere.

I left New York New York today for the last time and will not wager any of my money there again. There are other places in town that actually put a priority on their guests having good experiences. I'll be spending my money at THOSE places from this point forward.",0,0,0

No other charges, no surprises. Cool done! We chose to switch rooms mid trip because the basic room had a strip view and the suite didn't. Our choice. Just call the front desk when we're ready and they'll move our bags. Easy right. NO!

We were NOT told about this deposit by Kurt, however he made sure to cover his ass by noting in their system that he told us. We were not told about this at all.  We decide not to go with the bait and switch by Kurt and not do the suite upgrade. Already starting to dislike this hotel. A lot. 

Edna did nothing to help us with the situation. We asked her if she could at least have new towels sent to our room. My husband wanted to wait to make sure she put in the request because, at this point, nothing anyone said has been done. 
But we go ... It's just towels right... How could they get this one wrong... 

... 30 mins later, up in our room, still no towels. I call down to housekeeping asking about the request and THERES NO REQUEST. I asked house keeping myself for the towels and 15 mins later they show up. HOUSEKEEPING is the only department that got it right!

One thing that I absolutely hate about Vegas hotels is how full of smoke the main floor area always is. It sucks that you have to pass through the stinky area and breathe in second hand smoke every time you go in and out of the hotel. Right now it is just an annoyance, but staying in such hotels would be out of the question as soon as I'll have kids.

Comped room. I've stayed and played here in this hotel off and on over a decade so this review will be accurate and helpful. 

First, we are on the quiet side facing an arena which had thousands attending a Kanye West concert last night. (He needs your $ because he said so). The view is pretty cool at night with the lights of the strip and beyond. The most noise is from the LVPD Metro flying about. 

The noisy area of the hotel would be near the roller coaster but you can request at registration to be located away. 

I HIGHLY recommend the food restaurants in the New York hotel for lunch or in between gambling, shopping and .  The pizza is average but unfortunately doesn't come close to the real New York Pizza I've had on my 20+ visits to the REAL New York City and area on the east coast. 

Gambling...always friendly staff. Plenty of bars, easy to order drinks. 

Location Location Location. To be central in the strip, this hotel will meet your above average ""needs"" and your walking distance to quite a few other hotels and strip action. . 

Affordable hotel, check Expedia and place yourself on email for deals. 

ALWAYS obtain a gambling card to be registered and you'll be connected to other participating hotel casinos too. This ALWAYS helps to get a deal$.  

Draw back...no sports bar. But it's ok...we watched the Warriors game 7, at Paris (yes we flew kidding). 

Valet or NOT to Valet??...that was the question. It's about $18 a day to valet and $10 not to. Parking in this town has gone up. I ALWAYS recommend valet parking which is SAFER and allows comfort. The guys working that area were all patient and nice. 

MUSIC...there is a piano bar, VERY fun, drinks and singing participants YOU, ME, THEM...everyone sing along. I always forget the name but at night it's fun. 

Gallagher's is another good bar.

They do a good job of capturing the New York atmosphere, right down to hiring a lot of people who are apparently from New York or very good at faking the accent.  The coaster itself is a lot of fun, especially if you like vintage-feeling bumpy coasters (it feels like a wooden coaster) as opposed to super smooth rides.   

Getting on the coaster is not as much fun as actually riding it because you have to rent a locker for all your stuff.  You can't just leave your glasses or cell phone or whatever on a shelf when you get on and grab it when you get off - You need to rent the locker.  Since you have to walk quite a long distance to get to the coaster after you put your stuff in the locker, it's a bit of a hassle especially if you left your glasses and can't see without them.  Also if you want to ride twice they make you go out and come in again even when there is no line.   Finally, when you leave you have to go out through a very overcrowded souvenir shop.  

I like the arcade game room and again it does a pretty good job of capturing a New York amusement park vibe.  It tends to be way full of kids though since they have to have something to do other than the casino and this is one of the only options available.

Check in was lovely. We got a free upgrade from a Skyline room to a Park Avenue room, which is very nice! So front desk service was ace. Too bad we got the wrong direction to the elevator we needed to go to, but hey, maybe the free upgrade was worth it. Or maybe. 

Going to our room was really annoying. When we got to our floor, it felt like endless turns to get to our room. I guess because the building is a funny shape, the hallways are built accordingly. Too bad that it's really annoying, but at least you won't get lost. You just feel like you're in an intestine, waiting for the relief that is your room.

Rooms were decently clean. Bed was scratchy, and I just couldn't get comfortable. Very uncomfortable. I didn't sleep very well. In fact, I couldn't wait to wake up. This was very bad planning on my body's part, and because of this massive miscommunication, led to a not so fresh and energetic Hayne that was a little bit sick and required a little help from Starbucks and Theraflu... the former which was thankfully and conveniently located in the hotel. 

Bathroom was big, but the tub was kind of gross because it didn't drain. By this time, we had just given up on the room and was grateful to check out and move on. 

Bartender service was a little unfriendly. I felt like because the bartender saw that we were Asian, that he could skimp on service. Um, no! I felt super uncomfortable at the bar and instantly regretted even going there!

Also got a coupon booklet. Word of advice: get your jello shots from Fat Tuesdays. They're $1 and not... more than whatever they have the coupon for. Also, coupon for well drinks isn't really worth it. In fact, we just threw away our coupon book after thinking it over. There are lots of better deals out there that you can take advantage of. 

Overall? You get what you paid for. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this joint, and I would stay here again if a good deal like this popped up again. I just wouldn't be looking forward to the clogged drain and the bed, and I wouldn't get my drink on here.",2,2,0

We got three rooms total, all three were double queen beds. We also asked for roll-away cots in each room too and they gave them to us with no problem.... so we had a pretty comfortable stay.

We did most of our gambling at other casinos just because the table minimums were a little higher than we wanted to spend. The inside of the casino though is unique compared to some of the others, which I liked.  

Food wise-we ate at the Italian place one evening, had some late-night pizza one other night, and ate at the American place for some late night pancakes another night. All was pretty good.  

The location is pretty centralized which was good, allowed us to go to either end of the strip easily.  I think though that we spent most of our time across the street at the MGM though, and while gambling at some of the hotels at the ends of the strip. 

All in all, if I were considering for only the hotel rooms and sleeping arrangements I would rate a 4 (maybe even a 5).

We got into Vegas extremely early (like 7:00 AM early) but thankfully when we got to the hotel they had our room ready and waiting for us. We were celebrating my Birthday and Mother's Day for my mom and the hotel manager sent us a note welcoming us to the hotel and saying if we needed anything just give them a call. 

We got to the room and it was exactly what I wanted (it was a room with a strip view). The room was large, clean and while it was a bit noisy with the roller coaster I wasn't upset about it (I knew what I was getting into checking into a hotel with a roller coaster). The hotel is located in a great location (right across from MGM Grand and Excalibur).

Of course we didn't really stay in the room much but when we were there to sleep and shower it was nice. The beds were extremely comfortable and the shower\/bathroom was great.

My biggest complain is the $15 resort fee which you give you a crappy WIFI speed. The internet is slow that it took me forever to download an email. They have LAN Cable but there is no network cable in the room so I have to ask technician for a spare cable. The check-in line is very long and it took forever for them to check-in guest.

We booked the Park Avenue room, which is the smallest room they have (300sq ft, king size bed). It's basic, but met all our needs. The room and bathroom was visibly clean, the bed was really comfortable and the sheets were clean (we checked Anthony Melchiorri stye ^_^). The decor was ok. We got the view of the roller coaster and you can hear it from the room, but it didn't bother us because it wasn't too loud. It was more entertaining to watch it. 

We received great customer service at the front desk upon check in and at the casino. Our waitress was the sweetest lady. Offered us drinks while playing at the slots and made small talk and gave us water bottles. We tipped her well. The bar in the middle of the casino turned into a ""dance floor"" a few times. Great energy from people having a good time. 

Make sure you hit up The Chocolate Bar and get one of their chocolate martinis. You'll thank me later ^_^.

New York-New York went to great lengths and painstaking detail to try to capture landmark like Times Square and the Statue of Liberty.  Hey, it has to be accurate if the Postal Service mistakes faux Lady Liberty for the real deal!  Still, looks aren't everything.

Unfortunately, this is Las Vegas and New York-New York is a casino.  Sadly NY-NY falls a bit short in being able to impart the Vegas experience and a solid gaming, dining, and boozing experience.  The most egregious sin in my book that a casino can commit is to offer games that are blatant rip-offs!  It's a Saturday around noon and one of your few open blackjack tables, one using an 8-deck shoe, is only paying 6:5 on a blackjack...a fact noted only by the very small and easy to miss print on the placard that displays the table minimum   That, my friends, is a casino that's ripping off its customers.  MGM Resorts, I thought you were better than that!

In a nutshell, there's no way in hell that you'll find me sitting at a table or machine in New York-New York.

There were 14 of us total so we ended up getting 4 rooms (all at the double occupancy rate which was $60 on Thurs. and $129 Fri and Sat) and passing out wherever we ended up. The rooms were surprisingly clean and nice and as far as we could tell, they pretty much all have a view of some sorts -- ours looked out at the roller coaster. 

I called the day before we left to see if we could reserve rooms that were right next to eachother and was told that rooms are never assigned in advance, but when we showed up they were able to give us two larger adjoining rooms, one other two floors below, and one a little bit separated. Not perfect, but it still worked out totally fine. 

Like I said, the rooms were a pleasant surprise -- big windows, comfy beds and pillows, a nice tv and a big dresser, and a pretty clean, newer bathroom with lots of counter space. The only MAJOR bummer was that the rooms didn't have fridges, so keeping drinks\/mixers\/snacks cold required buying cheap styrofoam coolers at the CVS down the block. 

The pool at the hotel is nothing special but it served the purpose. It's fairly small and the chairs and lounges filled up really fast. There is a bar and food served, though, as well as a volleyball net in the middle of the pool and a hot tub (we saw some people using it, though I can't see how they could stand it in the heat). Don't even think about diving our swimming around though. The deepest point is only 4 or 4.5 feet deep with a bench that goes the whole way around, so it's really only ideal for standing and sitting. 

Locationally, NY NY is pretty convenient. It's at what I think is the southern end of the strip, next door to the Monte Carlo and across\/diagonal from the MGM Grand, Tropicana, and Excalibur. We never used it during our stay, but I noticed that the entrance to the Strip Tram station is literally RIGHT across the street at the MGM Grand and you can get there from a skyway bridge thing on the second floor of NY NY. 

Overall I had a great stay and was really happy with the hotel and the convenience of it and I would definitely stay there again if I found a good deal.",0,0,0

Because I do love the casino, night life & eateries. The people you run into here are always super friendly & fun! I absolutely love their restaurants, roller coaster, Nathan's hotdogs, piano bar, and coffee\/donuts at America cafe. I always make it a point to stop here every trip.

However, we decided to book a room here recently, since we came up a day early. I was very disappointed--Their rooms are outdated, with paper thin walls and very small. There was no fridge in the room and what made it even more miserable-- Their room card keys did not work!!! We had to alert security a few times to to let us into our hotel room & it did not work for parking. So sitting there in front of your room on a late night, having to desperately use the restroom is NOT COOL!!!! Especially being a first time guest. 

After letting Guest Relations know about this uncomfortable situation they did comp the resort & parking fee--(eyes rolling). And their email to me stated ""If you choose to come back as a guest"" really is saying A LOT---meaning ""we really don't care if you return."" They won't even give a corresponding reply email address to whom you are replying to in Guest Relations. Only a generic email that goes back into their email queue. Really?!!!!

So with that being said we will definitely NOT be staying at this property again. Get it together NYNY and make sure the room keys work. Or you will be losing more guests, but again you do not care about your guests, do you?!!!",6,2,0

There's even a coyote ugly bar in there! The room was nice, but of course I didn't spend too much time in there LOL the bed was so nice & comfy & I loved the shower! The room & this hotel are plenty accommodating!! The ONLY thing I wish different about this hotel is that they'd add more signs. It is EASY to get lost in here. Seriously lost. Which, of course, is very frustrating when you're drunk & trying to just get to your room. As it has been mentioned, this place really isn't as modern as other hotels, but I really didn't too much mind that.

I don't like that we booked our hotel on priceline for said amount, then are charged a daily fee.  WTF is that? I've never experienced that anywhere else.  Is that a Vegas thing?  

Also, I HATE their cable channels.  It might also be a Las Vegas thing, but they had better cable channels in a freaking Solvang, CA hotel.  

The worst thing of all is that if you'd like to watch a movie inside your hotel room you have to put 100 down-depending on how long you're staying there.  WTF is up with that? Really? 100 dollars? What if I only want to watch one movie.  Granted, they probably don't expect people to stay in their rooms, but man it was hot during the day.

I even felt comfortable running around this hotel room without sandals.  If you know me, this is a big thing because I hate hotel room carpet.  Maybe my room was recently remodeled?  

My boyfriend got us the spa suite (room 1815).  He paid $111 a night (not including tax and $22 resort fee (everyday)).  This was on a Friday and Saturday.  It was a deal from SmarterVegas.com.  Wow, I never knew how cool it would be to have a hot tub in a hotel room until we got this room.  While he was playing poker at the MGM (New York New York does not have a poker room), I got to sit in the hot tub and read and watch television.  I loved this so much.  AND, the hot tub was clean.  It looked brand new.  

I looked at the yelp pictures and the other spa suites did not look as big as ours.  Our room was huge.  Much bigger than the 500sqft that it was suppose to be.  Our room was probably 600 or 700 sqft.  Check out my pictures.  

We had a view of the roller coaster and parking lot.  It was fine.  I could hear people screaming on the roller coaster occasionally, but it was muffled.  I didn't really notice the noise at all unless I was standing at the window watching the roller coaster.

The casino didn't smell like smoke.  I really appreciated that.  Plus, I liked how the rooms were close to the parking lot.  In some of the other hotels, you have to walk forever to get to your car.  This place, not so much.  I also like that this place is located on the corner of Tropicana St.  This allows for a quick escape to and from the 15 freeway.  We never had to get on the Vegas strip in our car.

What I didn't like - the hot tub created a lot of steam.  I felt like I needed a vent in the room for the steam.  I hated operating the television because they didn't have a tv guide channel.  I like being able to go to one channel and see what's playing on every channel.  It sucked cycling through the channels from the hot tub trying to figure out whats on each channel.  Eh, first world problems.  The wifi is spotty.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  However, wifi was included in the resort fee.

I didn't get the best room, but because I waited too long, I had to pay over 900 dollars for these two nights in their second cheapest room the ""park avenue"" room.

The casino is okay, people make a huge deal about the huge slot machine and it's annoying to get to the Chrysler elevators, which are slow to pick you up even though there are six of them. 
Room itself was next to the roller coaster which was fun to watch. 
Cons-
-room occasionally smelt like sewage for some unknown reason.
-they pimp that zumanity crap everywhere even in my room's bathroom
-really really long hallways to get to your room
-their pizza in the food area made me sick but I have a sensitive stomach.
-frat guys yelling in the elevators (to be sadly expected at cheaper hotel like this)
-maid carts always in the hallway empty and gross food carts left there forever
-I think the maid stole my shirt 

The shirt story-
Left a shirt in the closet, brand new from the Harley davidson shop.called them, they said our room had not been cleaned since we left and they would send someone to check the closets. They said their was no shirt there. Suspicious because it's not in my luggage or in the room where I left it, it must be in the maid's  closet now...

Pros-
-it was open last minute
-beds didn't hurt my back 
-room seemed clean enough
(even though there was toothpaste spit left on my sink)
-tv was nice enough
-24 hour breakfast and room service (which I didn't try)
-they had my favorite wheel of fortune secret spins slot machine

Everything was fresh and warm and served so perfectly! I do wish we had a balcony in our room just because I love some fresh air from time to time. As the windows tend to just ""push back"" to open. Meaning they don't really open, there is just a small piece of metal that you have to open to just get an inch a fresh air. But for the most part, it was quiet  (we did get a room away from the coaster), secluded, the casino part is so great. It feels just like New York! It's spacey and not always crowded and I love their selection of restaurants! We ordered Italian twice for room service and both times it was absolutely delicious. The only 2 cons I had was that they don't offer a fridge unless you pay for it? Which is so odd and inconvenient. And 2nd, the cleaning lady actually opened my room door! And of course, I had the ""do not disturb"" sign on the door. But she opened anyway and I had to run to the door and say no thank you. That really bothered me as my boyfriend and I were there for business trip more than vacation. But I would stay again (if i had to). I just would get a fridge and maybe a balcony.

Along with being one of the newer hotel\/casinos in town, it is also really unique from the outside.  Inside it gets a bit crazy.  I quickly caught onto the fact that the designers of these casinos want you to get lost, quickly, and pass a lot of chances to drop some dough while you are finding your way to your elevator.   While we are on the subject of elevators.... With the striking 'skyline' appearance from the outside, NYNY is actually made up of several different ""towers"", which means that each one has it's own set of elevators.  The first couple times through the lobby it can be a tricky making it to your specific elevator.

The interior was pretty cool.  It might not be what you think of when you think NY, but it had a neat street feel to it.

Our room was about average, no disappointments, but nothing outstanding either.  I was pleased overall though.

One thing that really wowed me though was the wide variety of restaurants available.  There are really too many choices to list, but I ate at Il Fornaio Panetteria and Nine Fine Irishmen twice each.... the Panetteria for breakfast and Nine Fine once for lunch and once for dinner.  All of the meals were good, especially the ones at Nine Fine.  The restaurants were the highlight of our stay there.

The pool was a bit of a disappointment.  I think it was more of an afterthought for the designers.

They had to exit the elevator on the 39th floor and walk up two flights of stairs to get to their room on the 41st floor, that is just madness!!? They room was about half the size of mine, with a puny TV and a useless walk-in closet room.",0,0,0

My partner and I made the unfortunate mistake, more than once, of staying and NY NY. The first time was with my parents. They had our reservation completely wrong! They checked us into 2 smoking rooms with no strip view. Both my mother and I have health problems when it comes to smoke but that is not even the point! We booked 2 special packages, offered directly on NY NY's official website, that included strip view rooms that were NON smoking. I verified this with the clerk at check in and he rudely told us they were indeed nonsmoking. NY NY did move us to 2 rooms that were nonsmoking but they were on separate floors. That is not what we arranged when we booked our reservations. I completed an online survey about our stay later on and they actually offered us 2 nights free if we came back. My partner and I returned alone a couple of months later and it was an ""OK"" stay. During our second ""free"" stay we experienced HORRIBLE service at more than on of NY NY's food establishments. Many reviewers point out that NY NY's food options are not great. 
We chose to return a 3rd time because of NY NY's location and price several months later. This 3rd trip was THE WORST of all 4 stays. While we were there one of there house keeping staff walked into our room WITHOUT knocking. He was clearly in a hurry and and ran in to drop off pillows. We were not even up on a our feet before he was standing in the middle of our room. We jumped the moment we hear him coming in but he was going way too fast. When I reported this the manager on duty was completely rude. He actually tried to blame the situation on us! I later reported his conduct and was assured his manager would be contacting me. I waited one week to hear from them and then emailed them myself and competed their email survey, very honestly. Still nothing! POOR follow up! After I emailed the original contact from our first issue moths earlier, they offered us another 2 night stay and my partner and I sad ""this is THE last shot."" The general manager assured me that he would be at the front desk to greet us when we arrived and that our stay would be flawless. When we arrived, our reservations was completely wrong! After paying for flights and taking time off from work we arrive to find out that we would have a view of the parking garage and that our free stay was NOT free! They told us we would have to pay a resort fee! Unbelievable!!! After quite a long period of time at the front desk and meeting with yet another manager, the general manager emerged from some special place in their back office. He actually argued with me about the fee! Finally it was waived when I caused quite the scene in front of other customers. I will not stay at NY NY again and highly recommend you stay elsewhere if you wish to have privacy. Some will say we should have locked our door but we just stopped back into our room for 5-10 minutes to use the bathroom and then hit the strip again. 

If you value your hard earned money and wish to have a fun relaxing vacation where staff members are well mannered and trained to provide you quality service, DO NOT STAY AT NY NY. Try another hotel down the strip. 

Note: All of our troubles occurred between 9\/09 and 5\/10",1,0,0

We thought, ok great.  It was not right next to check in and i had to hit the escalator twice.  F U security and bell hop!  

We got an upgraded room with a jacuzzi (pic) in it.  It was nice to use it at the end of the night and anytime I can see the wife in a 2 piece of a no piece I'm a happy man.

Our room was far from the elevator, so it was quiet and left undisturbed. Yes, there's a roller coaster outside but it doesn't really affect your sleep.

At arrival there was quite the line with only 3 employee's working. I found this strange because it was the first hour of check-in. After finally getting checked in we get to the room and my wife started to take a shower so we could go out for the evening. About 5 minutes into the shower the water stops. I call down to the front desk to find out what was going on since my wife was covered in soap. The front desk person was extremely rude for no reason telling me that it's a big hotel and things go wrong. 

I explained that I was just trying to get an estimate on time so my wife could finish her shower. The front desk finally agrees to bring a couple bottles of water so she can at least get the soap off. 45 minutes later we finally get a knock on the door and was handed 2 8oz bottles of water. They said that's all they can give and we'd have to make it work.

Also hotel is located in the sightseeing helicopter flight path resulting in a flyby every 5 minutes or so and the windows are not very sound proof.

I paid extra for a premium view room, but there was no view and we were near the roller coaster so we had to hear that late into the night.  Not relaxing at all.  The layout of the casino was confusing - knowing what was on what floor was difficult.  On the positive:  beds were comfy, shower was hot & had good pressure, faster food options (NY Deli in particular) were good & well priced.  However, these few positives were not enough to get over the fact that this hotel is priced similar to other 4-Star Hotels, but the NY NY is FAR below the others.

We came here for a mini vacay in town because why live in Vegas if you're not going to take advantage of the resorts! Being from NYC it's hard not to pick certain things apart, so I will try not to, considering this is a hodgepodge of my hometown meant for tourist- I promise not to be too nit-picky. 
 
The New York New York Hotel is located on the South Las Vegas Strip and has connections to the other resorts such as MGM, Excalibur, Luxor, plus Mandalay Bay.  The outside of the hotel looks like someone took sections from all five Burroughs and fused them together like a patchwork quilt. Personally, I feel the fusion of all the Burroughs is Frankenstein-esk in appearance!

There are shops and restaurants inside of the hotel, as well as on the outside of the building to give you that New Yorky vibe. The inside of the hotel is congested like time square with all the tourist moving about, the lighting is ambient, you see a slew slot machines, and other gambling of sorts on the casino floor.
Our room was on the Century wing of the hotel. I liked the setup; it was pretty spacious, comfortable beds, great views, and the room smelled awesome- which is not something I can for a hotel room. Housekeeping kept the things tidy after we would come back from our wanderings the room was spotless. 

The pool is open from 9am-7pm I believe. I'm guessing they the close the pool sort of early because this is a family oriented hotel. I like the set up at the pool; there was a fair amount of seating, a big hot tub, and bar if you're in the mood for libations. My only complaint is that the pool was freezing cold, which you would think is a good thing but because the area has a ton of shading, so the water wasn't very pleasant. 

Aside from the cold pool I'm impressed!! If I had to stay here again I  would be okay with that, it was fun, affordable, and entertaining- my experience was great here.",5,1,2

But if I do, I almost never gamble on the strip. I recently was at the MGM and lost a big pot in poker. I knew I wasn't playing good and decided to hit up New York New York to get some of my losses back. Plus, I was hungry and thought that NYNY would have a lot of inexpensive food options.  I like the NYNY for their lower limit table games.  You can still find $5 Black Jack and 3 Card Poker for $5.  These limits are also available on the weekends.  This is good thing for tourist, gamblers on a budget, and people learning the table games. I played a few hands, got lucky enough to win about 75% of my original losses, and left.  By the way, I never did get anything to eat and still left hungry. 

The casino has made a lot of upgrades on the outside with cool additions like The Park and T-Mobile Arena.  However, the inside of the casino hasn't changed much since they opened.  

I really can't comment on the hotel rooms since it's been over 10 years since I stayed here.  I can say that the hotel rooms are a lot more affordable than the rest of the hotels on the strip. If you want the convenience of the strip without paying baller prices, then NYNY may be the place for you to stay at.

I normally stay at the ARIA and am certainly use to what I get there.  I was attending Vegas on a conference and use some of my comps to stay at the New York New York.  The rate I had will not add value to your decision on booking.  Here is what might help.  Check In was quick even though I could not find the VIP desk.  I was in a room on the 17th floor of the New York tower.  The room was in great shape and very clean.  It had everything I expected from a Vegas MGM resorts room.  I had asked the front desk to get me away from the noise and that is how I ended up on the 17th floor.  That said the noise from the coaster is very annoying.  I think maybe the 34th floor if it exists might have helped.  Since the coaster runs around the hotel I am not sure you can escape it.  If you are not looking to get to sleep earlier don't worry about it....it seems to end around midnight.   The only issue that I have and cant seem to get a reply on is the rate I was charged.  I was asked if I wanted to be billed in CDN funds and I said yes.  I think I have been charged over 30% when my card would have charged about 12%.  I have tried to call the number provided and was on hold for way to long....so I tried to use the email that they provided and I have not heard back.  I will refuse to be charged a criminal exchange rate.....if I can confirm that is what they have done....so far I can only trust what little information I have been provided when I used the online checkout....if they ever answer me I suspect I can get it resolved.  The hotel experience was just fine and I would be cautious of believing all the negative that I read.,0,0,0

We had a decent room. It was whatever. Nothing spectacular. Big-back TV, wardrobe instead of closets, 1990s style bathrooms. Whatever right?

Our room was near the elevators - view of the pool, the Monte Carlo and all of Las Vegas city. Non smoking room, only faintly smelled of cig smoke. A\/C worked too good. We were freezing at night but turning it off would have killed us. It was 104 F at midnight! I know it was the middle of July but when the sun goes down and there's no reprieve of the heat - you're doomed. 

The mirrors in the bathroom were not cleaned. The steam from my shower revealed a message to a partygirl long gone. ""Lisa, meet us at Piano. Dress slutty."" 

Our maid Rosalina came in knocking on Sunday at 830. WTF? She goes, ""You're still here? Oh! When are you leaving?"" I'm like, ""Lady, get out of my room... I'm not wearing any pants!"" It was pitch black in our room, that should've been the first indicator that we were still sleeping. Rosalina apologized and backed out of the room. I left her a tip worthy of that stunt. 

I didn't realize my room came with free drinks. The coupons are located in the envelope your room keys come in. They're good until the end of the year. Wi-Fi was good. No problems with that. There's a tax on the resort fee... one for each day you stay there. I would've appreciated a newspaper at my door but oh well, it ain't the Hilton.

We didn't use the pool - that's next time.",1,1,0

Through MyVegas, thy lover and I got 2 nights comped in their Park Ave room. Would've love to stay longer but life called for us to go back home. Either way the two nights there has definitely convinced us to return.

What I love about this hotel is that the staff is SUPER DUPER friendly and courteous! Being the tourist that I was, I went to check in at the WRONG LINE, which I believe was for VIP type guests but guess what, they still helped me out. After checking in, I saw a long ass line with a bunch of people waiting about 50 feet away. Oops but your bad =P

***BTW, we got a nice corner room facing errrthang bc I mentioned to the desk guy it was me and thy lover's first time in Vegas together (true story so we did not have to pay the rip off $50 upcharge for a corner and strip view)***

As opposed to the other hotels I've stayed at, this location has more of a ""we want you to enjoy your stay with us"" vibe. It's smaller than a lot of other places so I felt it was more of a REAL stay for vacation rather than there to party, gamble and go home type feel.

Anyways quick pros & cons:
Pros:
- Friendly staff
- Family friendly especially if you got kids (they have an awesome arcade)
- Easy to access a bunch of places on the strip
- Nice clean room
- Parking garage isn't a b***h to get to unlike other places if you need\/forget something in your car
Con:
- Limited selection of quick food joints (mainly dine in)

Ooooo another story, I pretty much lost a few hundos gambling at other casinos but my LAST $20 make it all up on this cool slot machine in NYNY. You the bomb!",0,1,0

However, two areas for needed improvement for me that occurred during my stay.

One, my ice bucket was filthy.  Luckily, I found a room attendant cleaning a room down the hall and requested a new ice bucket.  However, there were none available on the floor, so one had to be brought in from storage downstairs.  Two, room service goes around knocking and opening the doors to the rooms around 9:00 a.m., even though check-out is 11:00 a.m.  I understand that they want to turn rooms over as quickly as possible, however, please respect the 11:00 a.m check-out.

We were getting married at one of the pricier hotels on the strip and expected to utilize this pricer hotel for our honeymoon and wedding guess rooms. Well that didn't work out because that hotel required me to go through the wedding coordinator for everything and I couldn't get them to wouldn't return my calls\/emails. Which brings me to Ny-Ny......
      We contacted them and let them know we were going to stay with them and needed 2 town cars to take us to the other hotel on wedding day, 2 different rooms for grooms father and groom to stay in the night before, then the room for bride \/honeymoon. They were so helpful. The rep we spoke to even went over the salon bridal packages (I ended up going with a outside person that came to my room.) We were able to plan out the whole honeymoon with Ny-ny help. There was no pressure to sale us on upgrades, shows or anything. They let us know about some great things to see and told us about the MyVegas app which ended up getting us a lot of free stuff. :) The day of the wedding we came back to our room with a card from Ny-Ny and chocolate congratulating us. 

Check-in      
           When we got there the line wasn't that long of a wait to check in. (nothing compared to some of the other hotels on the strip.) 

Rooms
       We got the spa suite for the honeymoon, and the Park Ave for the groom. They were both nice rooms, clean, and were not loud. The view wasn't great, but its not a deal breaker. Beds were comfy. 

Pool
     The pool is nothing to write home about. I do think Ny-Ny needs to invest more money into the pool.

Food
    Love the food options they offer!! Chin-Chin has a great buffet. Plenty of snacks you can buy, or simple lunch food. Nine Fine Irishman is by far the best! Live music and Irish dancer at 9pm. Worse; Bar at Times Square. They wanted a $25. cover charge!!! Are you kidding me?! Its a bar, not a club. They have dueling pianos, but the bar was dead inside (and this was on a Friday night). Cover charge needs to be lowered. We weren't about to pay $25 for that. 

Casino
The casino is smaller then some of the others, but it made it perfect. It still offers plenty of gambling options and all the Dealers are really nice. They are willing to teach you the rules of the game if you arent aware of how to play. 

Over all Hotel 
    The hotel connects to MGM and Excalibur (5 mins walk from your room, and most of it inside a air-condition building to get to the next hotel). Its a really short walk compared to a lot of other places. You can take the tram from Excalibur to Luxor or Mandalay Bay. There is 2 Starbucks in the hotel as well. They aren't to far from the rooms either, which was really nice. They play great music through out the casino at night. All of the staff was friendly and really helpful. 

Overall, we will be back. Great job Ny-Ny for making our Honeymoon great. Because of your helpful staff all my wedding guest stay with you guys and we spent our money with you guys. 
My only request is to up grade that pool before we come back ;) My son will thank you.",1,0,0

I do expect a few more non smoking hotels to open up or change policy soon is what I expect.  I digress.....anyhoo, I absolutely love the two Irish bars here. My kind of places. The burger joint was good. The beds are comfy, the shower was pretty good and I liked the water pressure.  The best part of my stay was the roller coaster! That was amazing.

The hallways are super confusing, and has a maze like feel to it. It's s little strange but it's not big deal. Overall, my stay was decent. I wouldn't mind going back, as there wasn't too much to complain about.

The location itself is prime in my opinion. It's close proximity to everything you want to see, and it's one of the closer hotels off of the freeway. You see the rollercoaster and people having a good time, so it's a nice way to enter the strip. The reason the hotel is enticing is because they tried to replication NYC itself. The dining isn't too bad either. In my opinion this is a great hotel to stay if you're not in it for what the hotel has to offer in terms of a grand feel. 

If you're going for the pool area it isn't that great, there are plenty of hotels that offer a way better beach club feel to it then this place. But there isn't anything I can complain about. But it isn't my most favored hotel. The casino area itself isn't very impressive. I feel like if this hotel amp'd up all of its amenities it would be top notch.",0,1,1

This was my first time staying here and I have to say that the hotel is nice if you stay downstairs as a ""visitor"". Nice selection of good reasonably priced food and quick bites as well as plenty of places to grab a weak drink (stick to mixing your own).  The gambling floor was clean and the slots were a little tight not much action at all. The pool was ok but nothing grand just a place to cool off and kinda small for so many guests. The resort fee was not justifiable because there is no mini fridge, no coffee machine, you each get 1 small pillow, and a decorative pillow to fight over. The in room AC was designed by someone devious that's wants you to get sick! The air was switching from cold to hot and back again in an attempt to maintain your desired temp. The room and restroom lighting was too dim the bathroom sink smelled until you get some water down the drain and there was a serious lack of clean towels. I found my self reusing towels and drying off with a face towel in between turndown service. Decor and overall look of the hotel is nice, the floor employees were professional bartenders were a little lackluster. Beer Haus was decent pretty well rounded selection of craft beer and bites with fast service. Toms Urban sounded cool and unique but I think the menus is too diverse lots of directions with nothing really to anchor it down and make you come back, kinda like a buffet al la carte menu. I am non biased I'm not a Vegas regular but I do know good food, drink and can tell when I'm being taken care of. 

Would I stay here again probably not just based on my room notes. Would I come back to hang out yes.

*Tip one-If you like Rum and Coke or Coke and what ever ales-ya bring your own Coke this is a Pepsi only establishment.

Most of our  team stayed at the MGM Resort, but since they had sold out, this was the other closest option so we can all be close together.  I'm glad my company booked me here since the staff were all very nice everywhere I went.  From their check-in, to their restaurant staff and I was even surprised how good their breakfast was at America.  And for us carb and coffee lovers, the America Bakery has huge selection of donuts.  I suggest getting their vanilla donuts. It was quite delicious. And if you go right next door, they have Fornaio Cucina Italian bakery that serves a fantastic espresso and cappuccino.  My morning fix at 0600 all week!!  Hahahah  

Their room service here was amazing and quick.  I enjoyed their special King Crab and Steak for only under $16.  Man, that was a bargain for Vegas price right on The Strip.  I highly recommend if you are on a convention and get back late in your room, use their room service. They have a good selection too. Their maintenance crew was also fantastic.  My room was spotless.  I also love their elevator. It was lightning fast and quite convenient especially in the morning when I was rushing to catch our coach bus to head to the CES 2017 at 0700 heading to the Las Vegas Convention Center.

I'll admit I love the set-up of the casino and was very happy that my significant other (who swore up and down he wouldn't like Vegas) loosened up while wandering the mini street replicas of a city he really does love. Yet despite the friendly service at guest registration and the casino's atmosphere I was less than pleased with the room itself. The beds were comfortable enough, everything was in working order, the setup desirable, and things seemed clean.. however there was broken glass in one area of the room and upon further inspection I do not see how this room could have been vacuumed before our arrival. When calling our complaint in we were apologized to and told it would be cleaned right away. Well, it wasn't and since I didn't want to spend my time on the phone growing frustrated (I save that for calling my internet company) we just avoided that area of the room -- the entire time. 

Okay okay, so perhaps we should have called again. Maybe two peoples mistake  (the person who didn't vacuum and the person who didn't send someone to clean it up) was not worth knocking an entire hotel\/casino down despite the fact that the hotel is supposedly four stars. Well, I'll give you that.. but I have another complaint too! Upon our arrival we were informed that since we were staying at the hotel we could get 20% off tickets to see Zumanity, the Cirque du Soleil show available at NewYork-NewYork. We had planned on seeing a show to begin with so the proposed deal somewhat swayed our decision. After walking the strip we decided to just go with Zumanity and headed back, found ourselves in line, and then waited to be greeted by a less than charming woman behind the box office. No 20% off apparently, that was only for certain days of the week. (Alright, fine.) But, as we asked questions about the show to make sure we were making the right choice we were privvy to annoyed responses. Look lady, I'm not some cheapskate but registration told us the show was AWESOME and also told us we could get 20% off. Since one was a lie I want to make sure the other one wasn't as well. After realizing I wasn't going to get anywhere with this woman we just took our chances and purchased the tickets. 

Ugh, I suppose I wouldn't completely write this hotel\/casino off but I will definitely look elsewhere before booking here again. There are just too many options to have to deal with these types of scenarios.",0,0,0

The lady checking us in upgraded our room for free since we mentioned we were on our honeymoon. We got a spa room, which is just a room with a hot tub in it. I LOVED the view from the room! We were on the 33rd floor with a great view of the strip. The bed was comfortable, the hot tub was great and I loved the fact that there weren't a lot of rooms on our floor. We didn't hear much activity up there and felt like we had the whole floor to ourselves. 

We ate at a few different places while we were there. We knew to stay away from America since a lot of people got sick there, according to a few reviews. I tried the buffalo wings and fries from the Sportsbar restaurant (I can't recall the name). The wings were ok but instead of dipping the wings in the buffalo sauce, they cooked them in it so they came out a bit dry. Still pretty good if you dip them in ranch. The fries were really good! We had one order of the regular fries and one order of the parmesan fries. Get the regular fries. My husband got the sliders. They were ok. 

We then tried a place that was famous for it's burgers. I can't recall the name of this place either but you can't miss it since it's around the same area as the Sportsbar place and they literally have all kinds of burgers. It's their thing. I really liked that place. The burgers were good!! The service there was awesome. The waiter we got was very attentive and made sure we always had our glasses full. 

As for the gambling, I don't gamble much but I did play a few of the slots. They were ok.

I'll never stay in their hotel again. They gave us so much trouble when we stayed there last time. There was a heatwave going on, which I understood all of Vegas was experiencing over heating problems, inside all areas, we're not snobs & we ARE patient, BUT our rooms were a nightmare, the air conditioning didn't even turn on, at all, they kept making excuses about it & though they had other available rooms, they wouldn't move us the first night, they said they fixed our AC while we were out, but they didn't. My parents room was just fine, so their excuses that ALL the rooms were experiencing some minor problems wasn't true. We had to demand to change rooms. TWICE! The second room they moved us to had an AC but it wasn't working well. It was also very dingy & NOT what we paid for! So they moved us again. But were very put out that we even asked. They did not offer help with luggage, even though they changed us on completely different buildings, both times, I've got a disability & can't walk very much, my husband suffers from migraines, which he was experience while there because they made us sleep in a room that was about 98 degrees inside & super stuffy. But they still never apologized for ANY inconvenience & wouldn't even help us move our bags??? It was a nightmare!

The rooms were somewhat clean, but... could have been so much cleaner. Hair was all over all of the bathrooms! Which grosses me out! & the room was just... old & not what you'd expect. We paid higher prices for nicer rooms, but they weren't so nice! AND they overcharged my parents & us, & refused to give us the reserved price & would not refund us the overcharges. We complained & showed them all our paperwork claiming THEIR promised discount (wasn't a lot, but it WAS an overcharge). So we paid a lot more money for a lot less quality! 

I've never been to New York, but I hear that people in general are busy & rude! & that is the staff here at New York New York. Busy, so if you DO have to stay here, plan on waiting a million minutes for anyone to help you out, then expect to be treated like dirt for choosing to stay with them. RUDE RUDE RUDE!!!!!!

Oh they would also not help us out with little things like printing boarding passes (even though they advertise free online services\/printing for hotel guests) OR with wifi problems in our rooms & other little things like this.

Walking around the shops & deli's area is a neat experience, & I fell in love with a sweet lady working at one of the eateries there, wish I remembered where & who, I'd give NYNY 5 stars JUST for her!

We had a regular room and it wasn't super big or anything, but we weren't in the room much so it didn't matter. There wasn't a refridgerator, mini bar, hair dryer or coffee maker for those who are wondering. I had read yelp reviews before so I knew that going in. There are a couple of different places downstairs to get coffee, including Strabucks. The Starbucks line was always very long, but there's another little stand around the corner that will serve your coffee fix without the huge line.

The Club - The Rok absolutely SUCKED. It's tiny. We only went in for one drink and left. We aren't big club people, but thought we'd try it. We literally couldn't move anywhere. It's super small and they overpack it (like most Vegas clubs) and the scene wasn't that cool at all.

You can walk across a bridge to MGM grand and hit up studio 54 or their casino, which is quite a bit nicer. The sportsbook at NYNY is terrible - virtually no seating and the TVs are sky high, which will give you a neck ache by the end of a game. You're better off walking to MGM.

Call me old fashioned, but I like a good theme casino.  To me all of the uppity amenities in the world can not differentiate casinos in my mind.  They're all just boxes to gamble in.  Some of them are just nicer boxes.  Unless they have a theme to lure me in.  And few casinos stick to their theme as well as fake New York in Las Vegas.

I simply love everything from the cobblestone streets outside leading through a fake Brooklyn Bridge to the food court (with slightly inauthentic New York City bagels) designed to approximate the West Village (complete with street signs).  And, just like New York, they have a multiple story Hershey's World.  The facades are even more interesting than the casino games.  Though they have a few great ones of those too.

I was actually able to double my money on $.25 video blackjack because they have the game set to allow for splits and doubles.  Of course it's 2:1 blackjack but it was still the good variation.  Their video poker is pretty fair (8-5) to boot.

About the only thing that made it seem unlike the real New York City (or even the rest of Las Vegas) was how quiet it was.  Sitting in the ""West Village"" and eating bagels was actually pretty relaxing.  I love this casino as a good place to both indulge in and get away from the hustle of The Strip just outside of its doors.  This might be my favorite casino in the world.

Restaurants I've been to are not noteworthy. The Zumanity show hosted here is one of the lower-rated Cirque shows but is also adults-only, despite the casino itself being set up to appeal to families with children (hence the roller coaster).

Interior is the same as any other casino, rooms and meeting space is dull and dated. Glad to see they're getting some new business in (like Tom's Urban) but it's going to take more than yet another overpriced bar to get people in the door consistently.",3,4,0

NY NY was advertising rooms for $65\/night. I got so excited, I booked immediately. Turns out they add a $35\/night resort fee. Talk about bait and switch. Anyway we were still excited to go and felt that it was a great price nonetheless. We got there a little after 3pm when check in time was and there was already a long line to get to the reservation desk. The line moved pretty quickly and checked into room 1970. We got a strip view room with two queen beds. Small, but it'll do. We got a view of the MGM and the Big Apple rollercoaster. My husband turn the tv on to find he can only get 2 channels. He calls the front desk and tells them the situation. An engineer comes right away and fixes the problem. 

After the long drive, my husband wanted some coffee. Where's the coffee maker he asks. He calls the front desk to ask about one and they tell him they don't offer in room coffee makers. Wth!?! Never heard of a hotel not providing them. Of course...they want us to drop a buttload of money at Starbucks...ugh!

The next afternoon, my daughter was changing into her swimsuit to go down to the pool. Housekeeping just barges in with my daughter standing there naked! The maid just closes the door without even apologizing! I check and there is no inside lock on the door or one of those latch things!! Really?!? Unacceptable!

All in all some things were handled efficiently and to our extreme satisfaction...others not so much. But I still cannot believe the no door lock thing...That's crazy scary...glad nothing happened. Also I took full advantage of the safe to lock up my laptop and iPad while we were out of the room...I've heard this place has had issues with property being stolen from rooms.

Not sure we'd stay again...price was really good, but they need to fix the door lock problem.

Wifi is decent, with capable speeds able to play video.

The gym (in a separate part of the complex in another TOWER) should have been placed a tad closer to the other rooms.  The gym itself is quite small at any rate; though, there weren't a lot of people using it (probably for fear of people having to sweat profusely and then take the long and embarrassing trek back to the room).  

The atmosphere and the amenities in the main floor are pretty fun.  Huge selection of a variety of restaurants to spend boatloads of cash on.

The roller coaster is decidedly awful.  I must have banged my head five times on that hard seat--they should really consider remodeling that thing for a smoother experience.  They certainly make enough cash from it.",0,0,0

It was very easy to get free drinks here, even playing the penny slots.  The tables weren't overly busy, and I had a spot whenever I wanted it really at blackjack.

The food was very average though.  The Rainforest Cafe over at the MGM was far superior to anything here, and the breakfast at the America restaurant was downright terrible.

Another downside was the room.  It was apparently an upgraded room, but it was a bit dirty with long black hair in both the shower and the toiler.  Decent enough beds I suppose.

There really is no wow factor to this hotel. Rooms are clean, yet small. Sheets are clean, but not very modern. Amenities, well I don't remember any. It's all pretty bland. Didn't get on the roller coaster, which I kinda regret. Pool is small. And theres a very strange odor that lingers every now and then around the pool area.

I think the best part of the hotel is the lobby area. They have mock shops there, with restaurants. They have this one little pastry shop that is really cool. And sells great tarts. Right next to this gag magic gift shop. That carries a mock Shaun Connery mask. Its hilarious, other than that. I can't bring up anything memorable.

The room was large and my favorite touches were the IPod dock and fab. magnified lit mirror in the bathroom. 
The casino is good for slots, if you are after poker\/good table games, stay somewhere else. 
I had brunch at Il Fornaio (Wonderful!) and America (Horrible!), both around $30.00 including one drink. There is a Starbucks in the casino which has good muffins and lattes for the bargain price of $7.00.
My only complaints are:

I was very impressed by my choice of hotel!! We booked a Madison Ave Deluxe room and it looked big! The view was 'ehh' considering they gave us our room on the 4th floor but hey, its Vegas right?? I came to enjoy the ambience of the Strip, not to stay in a room all cooped up all weekend!! The staff was very friendly here. We ate at their buffet, which was at the Chin Chin restaurant. It was very affordable at only $14 a person! Other buffets were going for above $30. Heck no Im not paying that amount!! Their breakfast at the buffet was very delicious. Its cool that their hash browns are little and triangular in size!! I hadn't seen those since high school!! The casino area was pretty big, which also reeked of cigarettes, which also didn't bother me! We checked out Gonzalez y Gonzalez restaurant and club in the night time. It was a small place but with a good ambience. The music was great-Spanish music, the best kind to dance to!! Especially if you wanna see some ladies shake it!!! Since it was only a one night thing, we didn't get much of a chance to see the rest of the hotel. We did venture around it for a little bit on the day of our departure. Its cool how outside of Coyote Ugly, they have a little machine that lets you take free pix. The significant other fell in love with that and was hooked instantly! Women are such shutterbugs!! Yeah, this hotel isn't one of the new ones like Cosmopolitan, Wynn, or The Bellagio, but this hotel is very cozy and very affordable in price. Oh yeah, Gonzalez Y Gonzalez has no cover charge; just a little donation in the entrance is recommended. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anybody who is looking for a great hotel at a very affordable price. For only $20 extra at the time of booking, you can have your room ready by 10:00am. That's what we did and I must say, it worked out to our advantage! The pool was okay. Honestly, I saw much better looking pools with a greater ambience at other hotels we were checking out. I'd still give this hotel a very high recommendation to anybody. The only reason it gets 4 stars in my book is because I was looking forward to walking across the Brooklyn Bridge they had there, but it was under construction! Boo! Check out this hotel though, people! Take my word for it, it is very nice and one worth staying during your rendezvous in Las Vegas",0,0,0

While certainly not high end, it's still a decent 4 star hotel, especially considering the price, you can get some really good deals here.

However, with that comes the main downside - while a 400 square foot room is adequate for a short stay, I'd advise anyone to upgrade if they are staying longer or look for a deal elsewhere.  It just feels a tad cramped, and while staying in the room is not anything we really do much of, for me who is used to a lot of space at home it just makes me feel a bit claustrophobic, like they just tried to cram a little too much in there.  One thing they failed to cram in is a fridge - this is not the only hotel on the strip I have this complaint about by any means, but it still bugs me and adds another slight level of inconvenience.  Beyond that though, the room was nice, the king bed was really comfortable and the room was clean.  Can't really complain for the price we paid.

The casino here is great, especially the tables - has some of the friendliest dealers I've experienced in Vegas, and also seems to draw really friendly people to play as a result.  It was really fun playing here and while we tend to wander all over on the strip when visiting Vegas, on this last trip this was the only hotel we actually played in.

Food options are good here - I highly recommend Nine Fine Englishman for any meal be it breakfast, lunch or dinner.  II Fornaio (Italian) was good for breakfast.  I have separate reviews posted for those.

For my first big time in sin city, I was expecting a little more excitement, a little more bang for the buck.   

Well, I didn't get any of that.   What I did get was all the lights, drunk people slobbering over themselves, the smells of cigars and cigarettes everywhere, and well.. the only saving grace was stepping up and getting into one of the restaurants that were attached to the hotel.   

My room was rather lacking.   The closet for my clothes would not shut.   Normally that wouldn't be a problem, but there is also a light that is on inside of the closet, so all night long there was a bright beaming light across the center of my room... 

Our room had 1 spare outlet which just so happened to be behind the TV, which didn't really make things easy to plug things in and get them charging.  

And here's one stupid thing that annoyed me the most.  Hotel towels.  If I'm spending near $200 a night for a room, I expect the towels to feel a little bit more enjoyable than scraping dead skin cells off with sandpaper.    Just... maybe try something a little nicer next time.

Tons of free parking in the adjoining garage, and it was good to see bicycled security patrolling the lot.

I got a Park Avenue room for cheap. It had a desk with a LAN and wireless connection (""free"" with your $20 per day resort fee). Showers are a little narrow and the tubs are quite high so be sure you don't bang your knees. Everything else is clean, comfortable, standard.

I had a late check-out (3pm) tacked on for $20 and they were fine accommodating another 30 minutes after.

I did note that NY-NY seems less busy that then other South Strip properties. On the flip side, there were more kids here, probably because of the roller coaster and arcade.

Didn't eat here but other patrons seemed to enjoy Il Fornaio quite a bit. Always seemed to be a fun packed crowd at the Bar at Times Square.

It was a long walk from the elevator to our room, almost too long. Didn't go to the pool but walked by, looked small. Didn't try out the gym or spa either. The line was slow for a players card and getting comped. The sportsbook is weak. Probably 9 seats and you strain your neck trying to watch the t.v.'s. 

I think it's overrated as a 4 star property. Given the level of service and room I think it's more of a 3-3.5 star property. I only paid $55 a night so can't complain. 

Not a fan of the $12.95 resort fee. Why don't they just build that into the room rate.

The entire time, there was no one working there who was roaming the corridors for us to ask. When we finally found it and got up to the 7th floor (2nd and 3rd night of EDC), the ENTIRE path from elevator to our room (deep on the right side because the rest of the floor was booked with EDC goers) REEKED of vomit, weed, and alcohol.

I chose NYNY having never been to the strip, but I love NY so I figured the theme was enough. Thankfully, my systems for choosing hotels and restaurants has improved over time.

I called ahead the day of check-in to make sure we'd be able to get a non-smoking room and was told that it couldn't be guaranteed. Fortunately, at check-in it didn't prove to be a problem and we were given a perfectly smoke free room. The room wasn't fancy, but just what we needed for our strip experience. 

NYNY in my opinion is probably the most convenient casino on the strip for locals. The parking lot is rarely full and easy to access and exit. They probably have one of the shortest walks from parking garage to casino as well. For hotel guests it is also very convenient because the front desk is close to the parking garage entrance. The entire casino and restaurant layout is much less spread out than other casinos. 

NYNY didn't have the best restaurants when I stayed, but the new additions are great. Now they have Tom's Urban and Shake Shack plus some shops.

This is especially helpful if you are traveling with a bunch of girls. The desk can be used to put on make up and do hair because there is a convenient plug on top of the desk. There is also a full size mirror right outside the bathroom where someone else can get ready. 

The casino has plenty of things to do if you want to go dancing you can go to the Rok, if you want to sing in unison with a bunch of strangers you can go to the Bar at Times Square. If you want a thrill you can go on the Roller Coaster so there is something for everyone. 

The casino has it's share of new games but I try to stick to the ones I know because I'm always afraid I will lose my money quick if I don't choose wisely. I don't know anything though cause while my sister in law was following me I chose a machine I was familiar with and she played next to me. She won like $80.00 on her first spin betting 80 cents!

There are lockers to store your things (purses, bags, etc.) that cost .50 to use. They have them at the end of the line and there are a few at the platform to use if you've neglected to put your stuff away before getting in line. The roller coaster was quite entertaining.

Our room was comped thanks to my friend who likes to make it rain on the slot machines whenever she visits Vegas. I'm not sure what the regular rates were, but I'm glad it was free for me because our room was very basic and lacked the stereotypical over-the-top, big baller appeal I see so much on TV. Anyway, I guess that's the whole point - to deter you from staying in your room and just head straight down to the casino right?

One of the main attractions is the Big Apple roller coaster attached to the building outside that will snake its way through the food court inside. Pretty cool. The appearance of the casino itself felt borderline in need of a major upgrade in comparison to the others I've seen on the Vegas Strip. If you're against second-hand smoke, this is definitely not the place for you. There are tons of chain smokers galore and seemingly not enough adequate ventilation to keep up - you will surely reek like a fully loaded ashtray within minutes. 

The way the casino is structured doesn't make you feel the need to go out of bounds and venture the Vegas Strip. It seems like everything you could possibly want is contained right along inside. There's plenty of restaurants, gift stores, Starbucks, Hershey's Chocolate World, Zumanity by Cirque du Soleil, T-Mobile Arena, spa & salon, and several bars. 

Good luck!

There appear to be many mixed reviews for NYNY, so let me state at first that it is not a high-end resort and you shouldn't come here expecting it to be.  That being said, there are upgraded suites available if you're willing to pay.

Typically we stay in a standard room with one king sized bed.  Most recently we went with two queens sized beds since our children were  with us.  The rooms are not small enough to be claustrophobic, but not large enough to feel spacious.  They come equipped with wardrobes, dressers, and a basic but serviceable restroom.   The beds have always been comfortable for us, although they do that all-white sheet and comforter thing that gets annoying sometimes.

In terms of entertainment, this hotel\/casino is a hit.  For the grown-ups, there is the casino and a wide variety of eateries, not to mention the large pool with food and drink service.  For the kiddos, there is lots of kid-friendly fare, with a large arcade (purchase a card for $20 for about 30 minutes of entertainment there) and the aforementioned pool. There is also the roller coaster, but we have never ridden it.

We like to spend a lot of time at the pool.  It's large and not deep, so it's very kid friendly.  It can get crowded, but not as much as other hotels on the strip.  If all you want to do is take a dip and splash around, it's fine.  There is a little fountain feature in the center and usually a volleyball net strung up.  On a weekday, the cabana is a great deal for only $250 in food and drink purchases  (seriously, if you're getting drinks\/snacks\/meals at the pool for several people, then this is a piece of cake).

The other cool thing worth noting is that the valet service is automated.  The waiting area is nicely shaded and misted.  Just scan your ticket at the kiosk and your car pulls up after a short wait.  I thought it was awesome. 

Long story short, don't expect this to be a glamorous place to stay, but it is fun and cool.  You're also in a great spot on the strip, within walking distance to shops, movies, and lots of other casinos.",1,1,2

We only used the internet and we used the business center to print boarding passes. 
The interior of the hotel is decent. There was a lot of construction and some escalators were out of order, but a lot of things in Vegas were out of order or under construction. There were a quite a few restaurants. I visited the Starbucks, Haagen Daz, and a sandwich place. The sandwich place was the least satisfying. And of course the prices are jacked up at Starbucks.

Let's be honest, no one comes to Vegas to sit in their hotel room all day.

It's been awhile since I've been in New York New York.  I went today to pick up a ticket for Zumanity and I was reminded about the convoluted walk from the garage to the theatre.  I wish I had remembered the two short cuts which would have made my trek more pleasant.  Having said that, it was fun to see the tourist in its grazing area.  In fact, some were just standing there acting like they had a laser sight aimed at them and they were frozen in position.  Get out of my way, you dolt!

I made it to the theatre without too much difficulty but then I waited.  They were understaffed and they also had a customer who needed to make a phone call to find out about a lost reservation booked through her airline.  That kept that agent from helping others for awhile until the agent handed the phone through the bars and let the woman talk directly to the people with whom she had to get the problem resolved.

Ten minutes later, the woman is still on the phone and I make it to the window where she is.  The NY NY rep was a pure delight.  She found the ticket in the system with my confirmation number and she had me on my way in less than two minutes.  And, I took the shortcut back to the garage.

As for the casino and the areas in it, I always liked the vibe of this casino.  The New York theme, the restaurants, the food court--it all goes into making this place OK in my book in spite of the tourists (we have to love them--they pay so much in taxes)!

I'll be back in August for Zumanity.",5,5,4

I had never stayed at NYNY, though I had stumbled inside in May last year during a Bachelorette party and we ended up dancing on the bar at Coyote Ugly...lots of fun!  

I booked NYNY for a two-night stay during a promotional deal - discounted Zumanity tickets, a bunch of 2 for 1 coupons combined with Monte Carlo (think drinks, buffet, Lance Burton).  Overall, the promotional items were awesome, and had it not been for those, I would have totally regretted my stay at NYNY.

Out room was the size of a shoe-box.  Our ""view"" was of a brick wall.  Not even kidding.  You couldn't even see the sky, we were right against another building.  It almost felt like we were in hiding!  Our room also must have been right above the roller coaster because every 7 minutes (long into the night...) we'd hear this crazy rumbling above us, even making our lamps shake!  Even though we were stumbling into our show-box room at like 2AM, I was still unable to fall asleep due to the noise.  Already planning on being hungover, I was NOT happy that sleeping in and mid-day naps were out of the question due to such noise (ROLLER COASTER!)  Every other place I've stayed at in Vegas allows me to get my mid-day rest in, so I'm alive the next night and able to hit the strip feeling refreshed!

Our bathroom was pretty gross also, sure from a quick glance it looked clean, but the floors and bathtub were pretty filthy.

I'm giving the casino one star for Zumanity as it was a great show. The horrible, racist, experience I had afterwards I could have done without. 
On the way out of the hotel we stopped at the cigar shop for my boyfriend (we're both caucasian - it's relevant). We were chatting with the vendor; usual transaction until he asked what Zumanity was about. I said ""It's about sex"". He then said ""Oh, well do they have blacks and whites together?"" Me and my boyfriend looked at each other puzzled, then I responded ""well, yeah"". This is when the whole transaction turned. He said ""Oh that's wrong. That's sick. I'm not interested in that"". I was amazed that this man.. Who is at work.. Would so blatantly  share his racist views with two complete strangers..but we're white so I guess he thought he was safe?
After letting him know how offended I was, I pulled out a picture of my half black son and said I couldn't wait to get home to my baby, then walked away. 
I went to the front desk at the hotel to make a complaint. I immediately asked to speak to a manager due to the sensitivity of my complaint. A gentleman came out of the back and I told him what happened. The look on his face was not shock, as I apparently felt it should of been, it was indifference. I started to get the feeling he wasn't taking me seriously so I asked him to recap my complaint and he got some key facts wrong (like which vendor I was complaining about). He offered me his card and I gave him my work email address instead (I work for one of the largest travel companies in the world). He asked ""what do you want me to do with this?"" when he wrote down my email. I said I wanted him to give it to the person who is responsible for the relationship with the vendors and have them contact me so I could be reassured my complaint was take seriously.

When youre in Vegas you arent gonna spend too much time in your room anyway so I was OK with the size. The room itself was clean and the bathroom was nice. The Ipod dock barely worked and when it did it was mostly static, but again, you arent gonna hangout in your room and listen to music while youre in Vegas. From our room on the 18th floor, we had a decent view of the strip...I wish the windows were a little bigger though. My parents also had a Skyline room but they were lucky enough to get a corner room with double windows for a better view, so I guess its hit or miss. That brings up my next point. My parents and I booked seperate rooms but at the same time, so we were expecting to get connecting rooms or at least be nearby, but we weren't even on the same floor! They were on the 25th floor and way on the other side of the building.

This may be something you need to specify when you book by calling the hotel rather than just booking online. Other than that, I loved the exterior\/interior of the hotel. I've never been to NY, but it made me feel like I was really there. Inside of the casino was nice without being too rich or intimidating, its very relaxed and easy going and I liked that. Cocktail waitresses were friendly and came around frequently. Check in seemed to take forever, so we opted to use the express check out from our rooms which required me to leave a voice message to the main desk...kind of weird but whatever.

The young lady at the check-in desk was great when I was having problems with a new debit card (it wasn't activated correctly, easy fix!) and was patient while I worked it out. The room itself was flawless; we had one of the Spa Suites- totally worth the money. It was a corner room and we had a view of both Las Vegas Blvd and the T-Mobile park.  We saw Zumanity which was everything I was hoping for (who WOULDN'T want to see naked Cirque dancers?). I would definitely recommend this hotel to other people! 
PROS 
 the spa tub easily fit the two of us (he's over 6ft and still fit comfortably) which was perfect for a romantic evening 
 bed was perfect; we got less than 6 hours of sleep and still feel great 
 great service 
 easy access to restaurants (we loved the deli) 
 room service was fast 
 check out was fast and easy and they offer a spot to hang on to your luggage if you want to gambol a little more 
 I LOVED having a light up makeup mirror in the suite! 
 Having towels right next to the tub already was perfect 

CONS 
 We're both Las Vegas locals... even something as small as waiving the parking fee would have been great ESPECIALLY since we were actually staying on site or like, free play as an incentive to gambol 
 STEPS leading up to the spa tub, it was a bit high for me and I slipped getting out; it was a little bit of a safety hazard 
 I requested champagne flutes and never got them 
 A slightly later check-out time would have been great 
 Room Service was fast but the quesadilla tortilla was doughy and the ice cream was freezer burned 
 A mini-fridge should be a given in a suite 

Over-all, my cons are small nitpicks, this stay was exactly the romantic evening that we were looking for!",0,0,0

My husband surprised me with the Regency Penthouse suite and what an amazing place it was! It takes up the entire 35 th floor ( with the exception of one small room ) 

He made me go up myself to check it out and wow ! I walked in and was blown away. It was HUGE! Like perfect for a cocktail party entertaining huge. 

The living room \/ bar \/ kitchen  \/ dining area was all open concept. There was a large island with bar stools, hardwood floors, stereo system, sofa, dining table, arm chairs - there was enough seating for 17 people in that area alone !

Just off that area was a half bath with separate sink and mirror ( a perfect place for guests to go powder their nose ) The bedroom was also separate on the opposite side. 

Upscale decor with lots of glass tiles in the walls , It had a super comfy king size bed. ( Second only to the Aria sky-suites bed )  it also had a huge dresser, TV, end tables,
Separate  huge mirrored closet, plush carpeting, and another awesome bathroom. 

I love hotel bathrooms ! This one did not disappoint. It featured a raised jacuzzi tub, separate shower, deluxe toiletries, his and her sinks on either side of the room. The toilet was closed off and had a bidet. There was tasteful artwork including a cool sculpture right beside the jacuzzi. 

The entire suite was so luxurious and I felt so comfy there. After staying at the penthouse suite at Aria skysuites the previous week, it would of been hard to impress me - but this certainly did ! 

Besides the awesome room, NYNY had a great casino, wonderful 
Places to eat ( Mexican, Italian, Steakhouses, the 24 hr Cafe, just too many to name ! ) 

The location is ideal for getting to other resorts from ( Monte Carlo, MGM, Excalibur, Luxor, ect ) as well there are Marshals and Ross stores right across the street. 

The VIP lounge was one of the better ones. They had wine and beer as well as snacks, and the girls who worked there were excellent. 

I really didn't know what to expect from this place, but with lower expectations I was sure happily surprised ! 

* on a separate note, I did see a basic room and it looked pretty dreary and depressing VERY basic. I also saw one of their other spa suites which was nice, but by no means any comparison to The Regency ! Not sure how much it would cost as it was through my husbands Mlife platinum but if you get the opportunity to stay there ( or even just party there ) totally do it !",9,4,5

Not only does New York New York feel old, but many of the surrounding hotels are newer or more recently renovated.

New York New York is an average place to stay at on the strip.  It is a 'no frills' type of place, with not a lot of fun stuff to do and lacking in attractions.

On this recent trip, I stopped at the desk the morning after I checked in to make sure that I was in the correct room type because it was so much smaller than the room's the previous years.  I was assured that I was in the correct room but that sometimes the room size varies because of the building architecture.  The desk clerk offered to move me to another ""building"" without my asking and the room we were moved to was much more what we were accustomed to.

When we arrived at our room I was really impressed by how nice it was!  Very clean, roomy, and appealing.

The other positives about this hotel are the great restaurants, bars, shops, pool, and service.

Animal debauchery aside, (kidding) I managed to get a standard room and flight from a southwest deal for less then 70 bucks a night, during check-in the woman at the front desk inquired if I would like to pay a small upgrade to gain access to their Spa Deluxe Room, I figured I'm in Vegas, why not?

Man, the first night I was there was awesome, did some room service, caviar, a little bit of bubbly and chilled in the tub, while watching whatever movie they had to offer up on that big 'old flat screen TV!

Edna was ever so kind to check us into a Suite upgrade.  I can't thank her enough for that.  It was smoking room, that's all the could offer with early check in for clean rooms.

Room was spotless, I liked the um... Night view best.  The mountains are lovely to see but I live here so I guess I'm used to the beautiful mountain view.  Basic hair dryer, soap, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, & Kleenex inside the bathroom counter. ONE ash tray. They had not wet bar BUT the bathroom counter was where they put the ice bucket and 4 NY NY Clean glasses (I still won't trust it). It stunk to high heavens when we walked in, smoke hit me in the face it was to be expected I held my breath as long as I could until I opened the ALL vents on the window to air out the room with fresh air.  Ran the AC on COLD (second notch).

They had a wonderful menu of the spa facilities that I chose not to go for.  24 room service (or you can go downstairs to America their cafe same food).  Wifi was disappointing, not fast enough for my phone. I guess someone might of been HOGGING it for themselves or it was that bad.  I used my 4G phone connection.

We were also at the bar in America their 24 hour cafe the before our show. Loved the service, the manager checked on us frequently. I read about their beds being to die for top 3 in Vegas. We had a luxuriously comfortable king bed, which I took a power nap on. We had a show planned later in the evening. Over night, I got a full 6 hours before I woke up to some construction beeping faintly in the distance (We sleep with the TV on low to drown out the city noise I'm a light sleeper).

Eventually I got the resort fee waived at registration by another kind lady I can't quite remember her name. Short, black hair in a bun, soft spoken, possibly Asian. She genuinely cared about our stay.  $88 for a Tuesday night on the strip.  I left the vents open thinking the housekeeping might appreciate the clean air. I was disappointed the little housekeeping card didn't say a name who serviced the room very well done.  I'm giving this a moderate rating because I booked with M life I'm sure you could book cheaper with flight, hotel & car included though using Expedia. Travel sun-wed for cheaper rates.  NO buffet in this strip casino have to visit Monte Carlo we cut through Hersey's World to get to the front. You can go out by the Sports book and food court area too. I wanted fresh air and to check out the renovations to the front of NY NY and Monte Carlo.

I did give post a 1 minute 33 second video of our room and it really was nice. They have a parking garage for free or valet which is what we always do to avoid accidents.  You could park on the top floor of the parking garage in see it from our suite window, building Empire Tower. Floor 33.  If I booked again through their Mlife program online I would have to wait until I get an email for the bundles they have with dining credits when you book. They go fast.

The rooms are clean and nicely updated. I don't spend a lot of time in the rooms, so this suits me well. Their park avenue upgrade rooms are well worth the money as they've been recently renovated to keep pace with other hotel amenities.

Another issue with NYNY is the lack of pool space. Other properties Ive stayed at (MGM. Mandalay, and Bellagio) have multiple pools and lazy rivers to beat the heat. NYNY only has a single pool and its always jammin'...and why not when it's 100+ out.

When I go to Vegas I go for two things: food and gambling. The dining is lacking when compared to other big hotels. I'd expect to see at least one big name chef, but no. We ventured elsewhere to eat.

The shower\/tub combo was great with a deep tub that was great to soak in after those long walks. 

My only complaint would be the door going in and out of the room. There is a door thingy (yes, the technical term for it :) at the top of the door that slowed the door down so much (so it doesn't slam) that you have to stand there and wait for it or try to pull it closed, but then it doesn't close right as the top of the door hits the frame. So, every time you open the door you have to wait to make sure it closes before you go walking off. 

But, really....that's such a minor little thing! I really loved staying here and with my family, New York New York made us all feel so comfortable giving we had to bring kids to LV. I will definitely be coming back as we visit LV 3-4 times a year and I would absolutely recommend this hotel\/casino to anyone",4,1,1

(Or Imperial Palace, for that matter, which is the only other casino I've stayed at thus far.)

I've only been to NYC once, but one thing I'd say this casino captures is the hullabaloo factor of city streets.  There are so many different bars, restaurants and shops that when you add in the standard variety of tables and slot machines and hoardes of people, I'd say you've got a mind's eye view of what it might be like to be in Manhattan.  Maybe not spot on authentic, but what in Vegas actually is?  It's a newer casino, so everything appeared to be in fine working order.  The staff was particularly friendly across the board at check in, the America restaurant, the valet, and the gift shop.

We had a standard room with 2 queen beds.  It was just my boyfriend and myself, so we used one bed for our bags and slept in the other, and I was pleasantly surprised to find 2 extra pillows in the armoire, so we slept like two greedy pigs with 3 pillows apiece after we kiped the other two from the extra bed.

I find it amusing at how many people complain about the confusing layout of the casino floor.  I've only been to LV twice, but even I know that all casinos deliberately design themselves to keep you boxed in and away from the natural sunlight (noticed that there are no windows?) so that you gamble and drink for longer!  C'mon, let's not be so naiive.

Another plus is that this is across from an older mainstay, the MGM-Grand, where you can catch several shows, see some real live lions, and eat at a buffet.  There is a skyway linking the two.  This helps because New York, New York is on the southern end of the strip and not close to much else besides the aforementioned MGM-Grand, the Excalibur, and Mandalay Bay.  You'll still have to hoof it several blocks to get up to the likes of Caesar's, Paris, or the Venetian.

All in all I think this was a fine casino.  For my money (which I say metaphorically in this case since the bf paid), I prefer the theming and central location of Paris, the Venetian, or the Bellagio, but that's personal taste and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend New York New York to anyone looking for an on-Strip location in Las Vegas.",0,0,0

My wife and I were involved in the planning of a large charity event and had planned this trip as both a reward and something to look forward to as we did the grueling work on the event.  

On average, we go to Vegas 2 to 4 times a year.  Due to our work schedules we tend to go on Sundays- Thursdays.  This was our first time checking in on a Friday so when I saw the line at the front desk, my enjoyment of our trip was already in jeopardy.  The front desk had all windows open though and the line moved fairly quickly.  

Check-in itself thought was surprisingly quick and efficient.  I was surprised that there was no talk of a room deposit.  This is the first time that I have booked a trip like this with American Express so I don't know if that had anything to do with it, but we were checked in MUCH quicker that those around us.

Unlike many places in Vegas, the elevators were located near the front desk so we did not have to walk all of the way through the casino.  Bag service was prompt, especially for a Friday during prime check-in time.

Our jacuzzi room was clean and spacious.  Everything functioned well except for the television which pixelated on most of the stations making watching tv nearly impossible.  This is an issue only because I tend to wake up well before my wife and am looking for something to do.  

Valet service was prompt enough with no excessive waiting. 

We checked out via in-room television which went seamlessly.

Checking email and surfing the net was sufficient. The room\/non smoking floors didn't have any scent of smoke, which was a big plus. Nothing fancy, but a decent room to stay in for a few days.

Friendly and accommodating. Gave us a free room upgrade. One reason why I took off a star was because it took us 4 calls to get our room cleaned. Friendly Concierge and Bell services. Upon checking out, we stayed a few more hours, and checked our bags in. Check-in and out was no hassle.

It's in the middle of the Strip. Great access to all the local resorts...it's literally walking distance from MGM. And since it's part of the M life chain hotels, it was easy to pick up my Ka tickets at the Concierge.

One thing I like about the hotel is that there is a lot of things to at the hotel and at the neighboring hotels as they are east to walk to especially in late July.  

On this trip I ended up with room 8 which is almost at the end of of hallway from the elevator.  The good is that your far away from the elevator and all the noise of people walking by.  The bad is how far it is but it is good exercise.  

The room was clean and pretty big for one person.  The king size bed which is huge for me.  It was comfy and the pillows were soft.  No refrigerator in the room.  I understand some hotels are removing the refrigerator and all the amenities that go with it.  It is easier to have the convenience store in the lobby then stock all the rooms.

Bathroom was spacious and clean.  Plenty of hot water and water pressure.  With some hotels I have stayed at, the upper floors sometimes have water pressure issues.

Parking structure is easy to get into and out of.  Signs direct you into the casino so it is not very hard to get lost.  There are only 2 bridges linking the structure to the casino.  The casino is not very hard to navigate.  I usually key into several landmarks inside the casino as directional beacons to get me around the casino floor or find the elevators.

I made reservations for a two-bedroom, nonsmoking room a month in advance and called the hotel to confirm, they assured me my reservation said two-bedroom and nonsmoking.  When I arrived, I was upgraded to a one-bedroom room, I tried to decline but then they admitted they didn't have any available two-bedroom rooms that were nonsmoking.  When I got to my room, it reeked of smoke.  They sent up a rollaway bed and offered to send up some air fresheners as well, but didn't do anything else to make up for it, repeatedly reminding me that I had been upgraded, as though I should say thank you.  An apology would have gone a long way, their customer service is the worst I've encountered in Vegas.  The upgraded room had one king bed and a giant tub in the middle of the room, which seemed awkward.  The room and hallway looked a bit old, and the sink and shower in the bathroom had trouble draining.  The standing water covered my feet from a 10 minute shower and I managed to get standing water in the sink from washing my hands.  The bathroom also didn't have a fan.  The casino, like the room, is smokey and disappointing.  I had dinner at an Italian place in the hotel which was very tasty, but I wouldn't stay here again.

Unlike a few of the other places I've stayed, it was a pretty quick walk to the check-in counter. No line, so checking in took no more than 10mins. 

We had a Park Avenue room(2 queen beds) with a view of the roller coaster(would be cooler to see if it was lit up at night too) and partial of the strip. You could hear the people screaming on the roller coaster only really when you're going to bed because it's quiet in the room by then. Beds were really comfortable. Bathroom was a basic bathroom, hair dryer, make-up mirror. Nice to be able to adjust the shower head to aim higher & lower, especially when your friend is shorter than you! :)

Lots of food choices. The America restaurant has decent variety and pretty convenient for when you're ready to call it a night and eat after a long night out. 
Checked out Coyote Ugly on a Thursday night. Got in free so even if it had sucked, couldn't complain. It was kinda small but didn't matter. Had a great time there!

During our stay, I originally posted a review for this place and gave it four stars, but a combination of things that happened, especially on our last night, have compelled me to reduce that rating.

First, I called in early June to check rates.  Was told $60 per night double occupancy, with 30$ additional per person charge per night for extra people.  I claimed that was too pricey for me traveling with my wife and three kids, so they said ""oh, we can waive the additional per person fee"".  Great, I made my reservation and got a confirmation email.

During our subsequent road trip, I called two days in advance to reserve a roll away extra bed.  I was told there was ""no record"" of them agreeing to waive the fee, so I would have to pay an additional $90 per night for my three kids, and an additional $30 per night for one roll away bed.   I explained the offer to waive the fee, and that I had a confirming email, but the person on the phone basically called me a liar, said it was my problem, and offered to get her supervisor.  I proceeded to wait 27 minutes on hold before hanging up and calling back.  Never did talk to a supervisor.

When I called back, second person was more pleasant, and helpful, confirmed fee was waived and took care of me.  So even though at this point I had spent about 2 hours on the phone with this place, I gave a good review because I thought they had done a good job taking care of me.  Not so fast.

Our stay was ok, until the last night.  We had a wake up call at 5:30 AM so we could travel back home.  Unfortunately, maintenance decided to start replacing the vending and ice machines right outside our room at 3:00 AM.  After we were all awakened by the banging and pounding, I went out and asked them why they were working so loudly at 3 AM.  Guy responds ""that is just when we do it, too bad if you don't like it, we will be done soon"".  As someone who has actively practiced martial arts for a number of years, and still does practice, I fought off the almost overwhelming urge to pound his face through the wall.  I take my sleep very seriously.  So I opted to just tell him he was an A$$.

I call front desk but cant get anyone.  I call hotel operator, who says she will call supervisor and get them to stop.  That never happened.  Well, after listening to this another hour, I finally get through to someone at the front desk, who apologizes and offers to reduce our bill by $75.  I thank they them, and we get up and get on our way (at this point why try to go back to sleep for like 15 minutes).

So, then we get home and a ""final bill"" is emailed to us showing a charge of $175 more than we were originally quoted, and no indication of any $75 credit.  I call, spend another half an our on hold, finally get a person, who tells me ""That is just a mistake, dont worry about it"".   She sent me a receipt with an adjustment.

So, did they take care of us?  Yes.  But all the hassles and being woken up at 3 AM were just too much.  I will NEVER STAY HERE again.  Be forewarned, and stay at your own risk.",6,3,1

Down in the lobby they have recreated an entire 'street' of NY eateries, hot dog and pretzel stands, souvenir shops, etc which make you feel like you are in a version (albeit a warped one) of the big apple.

Overall my world was far from rocked though.  At over a hundred a night we seemed to get the room at the FAAAARRRR end of the corridor - it took 5 minutes at a time to get to the lifts!  The cleaners brutishly ignored the do not disturb sign and someone tried to access our room at 6.30am - if the bolt wasn't across we would have had an even nastier fright then the one we got. 

We were not provided with any of the promised amenities (newspaper, toiletries) and for $25 a day resort fee the internet was basically unsuable. We used our phone wifi. You don't get anything except a room for the price you pay.  Its pretty rubbish.  Our view (over the pool) was boring.  The front office staff were useless too... not their fault because they have to service so many people - but it felt so cold and clinical. They just didn't want to lift a finger to help.  We were just a number to them.

One thing that bothered us was that we called ahead and asked if we could have a couple of packages sent - they said 'thats fine'.  But what they didn't say was 'there is a $12 fee per package to pick them up'.  Macys.com decided to send our order in a few packages, meaning we had to pay twice! We ended up giving the business centre about $50 in fees for packages, which was horrible since the $39 a night Super8 down the road not only let us have things sent there for free, but also provided brerakfast, let us use the office phone AND had amazing wifi! 

Another problem was the credit card fee on check in.  I had been very unlucky to have both my credit cards stolen the week before (I know - how unlucky can you get!).  They literally would NOT let me check in without one.  I offered to pay cash and they said it wasn't possible.  I ended up giving them my debit card, which is totally stupid since all I did was load enough cash onto it for the transaction... thats basically like paying cash anyway right?   Being that it was my Australian debit card the transaction cost me a small fortune... so thanks for that. 

I get it, people love to stay at places like the NYNY when they go to Vegas, but next time I will be spending less on boring, average hotel rooms and more on going out and having fun. Out of all the places I have stayed in the world (across 60+ countries) I would rate this as one of my least favourite hotels - due mainly to the lack of value you recieve for the price you pay.",1,0,0

We usually stay at monte Carlo or mgm but had offers for 3 free night stay so decided to check it out. We were staying for 4 nights and were offered a upgrade for $75 to spa suite and decided to take it. What we were not told was that on our 4th night we would be charged for a regular night PLUS the $75 fee. When it was written on a piece of paper by the hotel staff that we would pay $75 a night next to each date. I spoke with the front desk upon checkout and she said she would adjust the difference but they only took off $67 in resort fees which did not cover all of any charge. Not too happy about that. 

However I will say that there is a lot more going on at this hotel and a lot more food options than previous hotels we have stayed. The spa suite was nice but I am sure we would've been fine with regular room as well. I mean you are only there to sleep.

Checkout shake shack and Toms urban (try the Cuban) for food...oh and pizza place for late night snack ;)

Our brief stay was awful.
My wife and I arrived around 7:15pm. Parking fees are ridiculous but at least guests pay $10 a day. The first hour is free so we went to eat at Shake Shack until we decide whether or not to stay at the hotel. The burgers are small and greasy to the point of sogging through the bun. Rather gross. By this time, much of our remaining free parking hour is gone so we decide to stay.
We head to the front desk and speak to a lady (possibly fillipino accent, short stature, shoulder length brown hair, glasses) she was short with her answers, didn't explain breakfast, checkout time nor the 50 dollar required deposit charged to my card. The door cards she gave us didn't work and we had to come back down to get new cards from a kinder african american lady. We also spoke to another caucasian lady at priority checkout with longer dark hair who was also helpful.
(Sorry for the descriptions as I was too focused on the issues at hand than to start taking names. If I start remembering names, that means the situation has turned exceptionally bad.)

The room had dirty floors that weren't vaccumed enough. The bathroom had hairs left behind by the previous guests. The toilet clogged so I called housekeeping and a kind lady answered and sent up a man who fixed it up. He was friendly and efficient.

My wife and I decided to tour the strip for a few hours and split up for a while to explore the sights. Her phone dies and her charger is broken so she returned to the hotel looking for me. She forgot our room number and went to the front desk to ask.

She speaks to a lady (asain, longer than shoulder length black hair, round glasses) who was obviously already having a bad day. We later find out her name is or sounds like Nuri. (Not sure of the spelling because her hair covers her name tag). My wife asks for our room number and provides my name for the booking but Nuri doesn't quite get it and can't find my name in the system. My wife is Korean and has a slight accent. It just so happens that Nuri also speaks Korean and recognizes my wife as a Korean. Now we don't automatically assume that every asain we speak to is Korean so my wife started the conversation in English but Nuri rudely asks my wife to switch to speaking Korean.
Her facial expressions appeared annoyed and she spoke with a rude tone of voice looking down towards my wife. She told my wife ""You gave me the wrong name"" My wife then wrote down my name on paper to prove in fact she did know my name and how to spell it. Then Nuri accused her of initially giving her the wrong spelling and said things like ""How could I find it if you give me the wrong name?"" instead of saying, ""oh I'm sorry I mis-heard"" or any kind of apology. 
In any language, you should never speak to customers in that manner or with an angry disrespectfull tone.

My wife goes to the room, tells me what happened after I return and I'm infuriated. She takes a shower and the slow drain is causing water to pool up passed her ankles. I call housekeeping and a man answers and sends the same man who fixed the toilet. He effectively fixes drain. Good guy, no complaints about him.

Unfortunately we can't be comfortable with the room and we're too angry. It's our first trip to Vegas and it's ruined. It's about 5am and we haven't slept but we can't handle staying.

We pack up and go to check out. I get a chance to speak to Nuri and she recognizes my wife so she's quick to refund the resort and parking fees. The room was booked through Hotels.com which i guess is also owned by expedia.com and the hotel claims they can't refund the room charge. I call Hotels.com to confirm and the rep tries to call the hotel but can't reach them for some reason even though the general manager has arrived and is standing in front of me and they wont talk to each other over my phone. I file a request for refund through Hotels.com and will have to wait upto 72 hours to hear back. 

The general manager (Mark I think?) says there's not much he can do. He interrupts us as we explain our issues and claims we didn't call about any problems with the room earlier even though I called twice. I called housekeeping but he says all calls go to the front desk. We chose to leave and hope that Hotels.com will take care of the rest.

I could have paid less at a cheaper hotel. I thought paying more at a 4 star with decent reviews would help us avoid issues like these. 
We're never coming back.

 Check in: There was a line but is expected in Vegas, it went by quick. Front desk rep was very hospitable. Gave me a room on the 17th floor.

Room:  The room was super spacious. It had a wardrobe unit, 2 sitting chairs and a desk. I had a view of the parking garage across the way, the rollwler coaster and the pool below. Restroom had plenty of space as well. The only downside of the room was that it was lacking additional wall outlets to charge multiple devices. Free wifi.

Pool: NyNy's pool is more closely compared to those of lesser caliber hotels. No wow factor really just that the roller coaster can be seen and heard from above. Pool is on the small side compared to other hotels on the strip. 

Grounds: If you have a car, you use your room key to get in and out, unlimited, and also includes other mgm properties for the parking fee paid. So you pay the required parking fee and you have access to other mgm
properties parking garages using your room key.  Also if your room is to be accessed through the new yorkers tower elevators you can also get to your room via the arcade on the 2nd floor.

Comments on casino and roller coaster only, not hotel. 

The casino itself is worth a walk through. It looks like pictures of new york. A cool concept. The dealers were hit and miss (ha!) with friendliness, let it ride was a hit, roulette was a miss. 

The roller coaster, which I seem to recall was $7 per ride, was pretty intense! Really. It was frightening because we were stalled at the bottom for a good 5 minutes before it started working. The ride itself was fun but intense, not for the weak of stomach.

Outside the Hotel\/Casino, you will see miniature replicas of New York monuments, one being a mini Brooklyn Bridge on the sidewalk and the Statue of Liberty at the front of everything. There's even some random roller coaster called The Roller Coaster that you can actually ride.

-- CASINO --
I didn't spend too much time in here; I mainly wanted to see what it looked like inside. Inside you'll find bars and sections named after New York landmarks. There was nothing particularly memorable that stood out.

What did stand out was me trying to get out of this casino. Now I know they are built to keep you lost, and I have a pretty firm sense of direction, but this casino was the only one in Vegas that confused me on how to get out. I initially entered through one set of doors, explored around, and then tried to find that same set of doors to get out. I went out one area to be greeted by the car pickup area. I used Google Maps on my phone and it took me to the parking lot, which only circled me back to that same car pickup area. I gave up and just used my intuition to find the street again.

-- SUMMARY --

New York isn't exactly exotic, or perhaps my first choice for a theme, but I thought the hotel was beautifully done and the theme was much more prominent than any other hotel we visited. 

Our room had an amazing view of the end of the strip. The room itself was nothing amazing, but it had a very nice touch of class, and was a good place to lay our heads between trips to the casinos--and certainly wasn't badly priced considering the alternatives.  

The hotel is just a convenient walk away from the monorail behind MGM.  The casino was large and dark, with bright neon signs everywhere- echoing the look of Times Square.  NYNY is also known for its miniature Statue of Liberty- which is fun to take pics with- and fullsize rollcoaster. 

The casino itself had a gorgeous bar in the center, and the tables were always hot.  We met a very nice couple one night that taught us how to play (and win!) in blackjack, and it quickly became my favorite game.  The vibe was fun and not stuffy like the Belagio or Paris.

The amount of trouble this caused everyone involved in this trip was astounding. It really did pretty much ruin the vacation, as ridiculous as it sounds. Even if you're not a heavy smoker at all, like a few cigarettes a day, when you're staying 25 stories up in a hotel and are ready to go to bed, but you need one last smoke, and you have to change back into your shoes and clothes and you're not wearing any makeup because you didn't think you would be up for long enough to have to come all the way back down here and you're around hundreds of people milling around, looking like a slob... it's really the fucking worst and it makes you very very very angry. 

I guess I'm never staying at an MGM property again, since they've done this to all their hotels. Even in California you can get smoking rooms. 

And the fact that they made this change less than a week before our stay without telling us beforehand just shows it was ill planned. I hope at least some of their properties revert back, or have outside smoking areas placed on every floor in some hotels. 

Also the hallway was ridiculous. We were at the very end of it and it was like if we had to make ONE MORE twist and turn it would had to have been a joke. Not only do you have to wait for an elevator and go down 25 floors before you smoke, you also are at the whim of whoever places you in a room. The walk down the hallway takes 2 or 3 minutes, not an exaggeration. 

On top of everything the air in this hotel was just bad. I had watery eyes and an itchy throat and severely stuffed up sinuses every morning, maybe from the heater, which had to be on, otherwise it was too cold. I could go visit other hotels on the strip, even other MGM properties, and my eyes would eventually clear up and sinuses too, but five minutes after being back in NYNY it would all come back. Our last day there I woke up with straight up laryngitis, thinking I must be sick, but sure enough it cleared up a few hours after leaving. 

There was good food in here and the roller coaster was fun, the arcade was amazing and had sweet games, but I would never ever ever recommend someone stay here because this experience was just torture, and even if you're a non-smoker the air is SO TERRIBLE in here it's not worth it.

So anybody who sees the videos on YouTube or the pictures on their site, trust me they don't all look like that & some are a lot smaller than the one they advertise. I tried calling in a few days before to ask them to block me into one of the penthouses with the balcony and every person I spoke to was unhelpful and sort of robotic about their speeches. I felt like nobody really wanted to help me.

At check in I was really nervous that we'd get the small penthouse. I needed the large one because I was having a gathering in there and needed room for my guests. We were so lucky to have Daylinda as our check in agent because she was so helpful and patient! We got checked in to the penthouse called ""The Ritz"" and while it was nice it wasn't what we were looking for. I went back to the desk and saw Daylinda again to see if she could help us out. She offered another option to us and let us go up to see it before we made our decision. We ended up LOVING ""The Regency"" penthouse. Very spacious & wide open. My boyfriend tipped her for being so accommodating. We really appreciated her help!

The penthouse easily fit a lot of guests. The jacuzzi tub is the very best I've seen in Las Vegas. We had a nice view of MGM out of the bedroom and of the Excalibur out of the living room. Also if you have an iPhone or iPod, they have a docking station with speakers set up in the ceilings of every room including the bathrooms. Party mode is awesome it plays the music EVERYWHERE! The only thing I didn't like was there was no microwave. It's a penthouse it should at least have that (other models do).


Room: 4.5 stars (very nice but could use microwave)
Service: 2 stars (this includes everybody I spoke with except Daylinda)
Price: 3 stars (you easily get money's worth but it entirely depends on the luck of the draw with the penthouse you get assigned to. It really shouldn't be the same price for such huge differences in size. I would have gladly payed more to guarantee the larger one)
Daylinda: 5 stars (she deserves a raise!)

Let's start off with the room:
I asked for a non-smoking room but clearly got a room that smelt like smoke. Sure, maybe a guest smoked in the room when they weren't suppose to, but it's still up to the cleaning crew to notice it and take care of the situation. I had to talk to two managers before they would finally swap my room. Unacceptable.

When I finally got into a room that didn't smell like an ashtray, I decided to take a shower. The shower was filthy, with remnants of the last guest's hair. Trying not to be negative and cause more issues, I just rinsed it down the drain and sucked it up.

WiFi:
Now, I know many of you reading this might laugh at me for even mentioning wifi when I'm in Vegas, BUT, like many of my other colleagues, we were here for CES to work. That being said: MGM properties had no WiFi. This makes it really tough for me to do the work I was sent there to do, which was cover the conference.

It took a total of 2 hours and 3 front desk managers to finally come up with a plan for people like me trying to get some work done. Apparently there were meeting rooms up on the second floor that had wifi. So that ended up being their solution.

Staff:
There seemed to be no authority. I spoke with multiple staff throughout the week which included managers, front desk, bell desk, etc, and all seemed as though they were part of the same pay grade. Like neither of them had the authority to make something happen. When speaking to managers about issues I was having, they all look dumbfounded like they have never had a concern or an issue presented to them before. It was a disaster.

Not once was I offered any sort-of comp or kind gesture for the trouble I was having. I'm not one to ask for anything, nor do I look for free things, but when you travel as much as I do, you know what good service is, especially in hotels.",2,0,1

The room was great: clean, great view, comfy beds and good lotion.

Room service is tricky, they include the 18% gratuity and then they ask for additional tip, I got duped and tipped more.

I gambled some hard earned cash at roulette and played some nickel slots too. The cocktails were flowing and the cigarettes were burning.

I guess it's good to keep your expectations low, because I was pleasantly surprised by the contemporary look of the room itself, albeit small, but not so small that I was tripping over my own feet.  

I had made the reservation several months ago, and had requested a room on a higher level floor, which they noted at the time, but again, I was surprised that they actually honored the request.  I went with my boyfriend- our room was on the 28th floor.  Yay for heights!  My only complaint about the room was that the walls were thin.  Really thin.  Either that, or the people having sex next door were being really loud.  I had to turn the T.V. on halfway to full blast, and I could still hear them.  Geez.  I realize it's Vegas, but still.  

While the room itself met (possibly even exceeded) my expectations, the stay at NY-NY was not without occasional inconvenience.  When we first arrived, before we even checked in, we went over to the Zumanity box office to purchase the $25 Passport Coupon Booklet, which is featured on the hotel's website, but as we would soon found out, was nothing but a big annoyance and produced what appeared to be lousy, pointless coupons.  Passport highly NOT recommended.  Unless you want to do some running back and forth throughout the hotel, in which case, you'd be better off walking the strip.  

After we had purchased the Passport, we checked in, not after discovering that coupons in the booklet were expired by more than a year.  Bah!  We checked with the concierge to make sure that we could still use the coupons, and they gave the okay.  Yet, when we tried to use one of the ""Buy One, Get One Free"" drink coupons at the Bar at Times Square, the bartender wouldn't honor the coupon.  This led us back to the concierge, who asked us to come back in the morning to see if accounting would comp the 2 drinks we had just purchased.

We did a lot of back and forth from the concierge and the Zumanity box office that next day.  It was slightly annoying that we had to explain the story to every staff person at both places, even more annoying that the staff didn't seem to want to offer to either comp our drinks or refund us the money we had paid for the Passport, not until we asked for this specifically anyway.  Staff were friendly, patient, and apologetic toward us though, and we eventually did get a refund for the Passport, in addition to two free drink coupons, which somehow made the whole rendezvous worthwhile, and earned NY-NY a 4 star rating.  Good thing, too, because after all of that, we really did need a drink!

Overall, the experience at NY-NY was decent.  I would stay here again, but will definitely forgo any coupon booklet that I actually have to fork over money for.  Especially one that's expired.",3,1,0

In Vegas, I would give it 3* as a true pleasure seeker (single, with an SO, or with friends) and a 4* as a family-equipped traveler. Note that I've never stayed here and am only referring to the public areas.

Alas, it is in a city where the standards for tackiness and everything done in excess are high. Many factors including proximity to other trendy destinations, the restaurants, the shows, the casino's machines\/tables\/drink service, and the quality\/maintenance of the interior means the difference between attracting Giuseppe Zanottis or New Balances. (Not knocking the NBs here since I, for one, have discovered upon becoming a Mom that NBs are some of the most comfortable shoes in the world. Yep, I do fit the stereotype.)

New York New York offers nothing in the way of fine dining and high end retail stores but is home to the (delicious!) burger and concrete shake powerhouse Shake Shack and two of the better shows in Las Vegas: Blue Man Group and Cirque du Soleil's Zumanity. It's also home to a pretty thrilling roller coaster that starts indoors and continues outside for some high drops and one big loop.

The outside might make genuine fans of the real NYC like myself gag, but the interior is pretty charming and looks a bit like some of New York's neighborhoods and streets, with a cobblestone walkway and rows of what appear to be brownstone buildings with fire escapes and an area modeled after Greenwich Village.

Plans for renovation were announced last year. Can't wait to see what kind of changes they'll be making!

- shows\/entertainment 5* (2 good shows + roller coaster)
- restaurants\/dining 4* (it was once 2* for me, but the addition of the Shake Shack is enough of a reason to lure me into NYNY. Now all they need is the chicken rice cart from 6th & 53rd or 49th & 6th and they will have secured a visit from me on EVERY future trip to Las Vegas.)

The facility is undoubtedly impressive in its stature and architecture.  The inside streets and layout of the casino are one of my favorites in Vegas.  There is plenty to do here, plenty to see and plenty of places to wander around.  However, with that comes an entourage of kids and families checking out the facility or staying here.  In my book this is a con not because I have a distaste for children in general but because it seems that parents never truly watch them appropriately to my standards.  

I'm a big fan of the casino floor here.  Everything seems to flow here and there is adequate space to move around which can be uncommon in LV.  There is not just rows and rows of tables and slot machines throughout.  Things curve, angle, etc and it makes for a nice ambiance and is aesthetically pleasing.  Plus we won a decent amount of money here which may have skewed my opinion.  I love the easy exits to the both the street level and the upper level that leads across to MGM.  This is pretty big benefit given that the actual location is a bit further from center then I would prefer.

Also the selection of beverages and food here is pretty decent and allows for some late night opportunities which is a plus.  We did not sit down at any of the restaurants here other then the little breakfast place which was uninspiring and provided less then stellar service. (And service is something I'm rarely picky about)

The other drawbacks of NY-NY are the lack of a coffee maker in the room on par with most of the LV Strip outside of the Monte Carlo at least.  The staff here was less helpful then at other spots and despite requesting close rooms six weeks in advance we were scattered down a few different hallways which I would have to assume could have been avoided with better planning.

Let's start at the beginning. A few friends were spending the week in Las Vegas, and NY, NY was the right price. As a recent Vegas transplant, I have my regular casinos that I frequent, and NY, NY isn't one of them, but since our friends wanted to play where they were staying, we indulged them. On day 1, my husbands experience with a Blackjack dealer was atrocious. The dealer felt it was appropriate to roll her eyes and make condescending remarks to my husband regarding a conversation he was having with his friend about game strategy. When her relief didn't come on schedule, she became disengaged in the game entirely, barely keeping her eyes on the table. 

On day 2, we sat at different blackjack table for over an hour without 1 waitress coming to take our order. After an hour passed and my husband played through literally $500, a waitress finally arrived. The waitress took our friends orders and when my husband attempted to finally order a drink, the waitress tells us, ""We can only serve casino guests who are playing."" He explains to the waitress that he just played through literally $500 while no one serviced our table, the waitress puts on a pouty-face, shrugs, and tells him that she is refusing to serve him. When the waitress walks away from out table, we begin to discuss amongst ourselves how utterly ridiculous the service we have received for 2 days straight is. The waitress turns around, returns to our table, and asks us if we have a problem. She actually turned around, returned to us, and joined in our conversation. She then tells us that it's the company policy and suggests to complain to them. At this point, the waitress has refused us service after we have played for over 60 minutes, played through $500 and she is now being hostile to us as well. We decided that we no longer wanted to play at NY, NY and promptly went to valet to retrieve our car. 

I have never received such horrible service at any other M Life casino, or any other casino at Las Vegas to be honest. We are M Life Gold Card members and we were shocked at how terrible the staff at New York, New York treats guests. We will NEVER return to NY, NY and will definitely never ever recommend the hotel to friends and family who are coming from out of town. If they suggest staying there we will urge them not to. If I see someone, anyone on social media suggest they are thinking about staying at NY, NY, I will be there to strongly urge them against it. This wasn't an isolated incident with 1 staff member, so clearly this is a reflection of the standards New York, New York has for its staff, it's quite obvious there are no standards in place. Both of these women felt it was quite fine, probably encouraged to treat guests like trash. That speaks to their management. You can waste both your time and the managers time complaining about how rude the staff is, but they likely all have a nice laugh about it after hours. Don't give your money to an establishment that feels comfortable treating guests like a jackass. 

If they think treating guests like trash is part of their New York charm, as a native New Yorker, I can tell you that they're way off base. New Yorkers might be a bit blunt, but their M.O. isn't to make you uncomfortable or to embarrass. This is a lack of class. The staff here is on a mission to make guests feel unwelcome.

After doing some research I decided I wanted to upgrade to a penthouse suite. Mainly because the price online seemed to be a great deal with my Mlife! I watched some you tube videos, and the few that are posted showed the penthouse suites with balconies. So...heads up you must be specific if that is the penthouse type you want.

I was able to upgrade upon arrival. The employee helping me stated the price, however, he did not communicate properly that the price he was giving me would be in addition to what I already paid for the room. Not a huge deal, but something that I feel should have been explained in detail. I get to the penthouse suite, ""The Drake"", when I opened the door first thing I noticed was, it does not look like the penthouse suite shown on the website. Next, I do my walk through and notice zero balconies. So at this point I am a bit upset but overall the room was nice so I figured I would ask the front desk later about this. (which is how i found out if you want the balcony penthouse you must request it specifically)

On the plus side, upon walking in you have a 3\/4 bath to your right, closet on you left. In front of you is a sitting room with a couch, coffee table, chair, cabinet, wet bar with a small flat screen tv. Also included which was great, complimentary water, soda, and coffee. 
As you proceed you next come to the living room\/dinning room area. Full couch, chair, flat screen tv, and the dinning room table with 4 chairs and small flat screen in dinning room area.
Continue on and you get to the bedroom and next to the bed is a spa\/jacuzzi tub. Also has a small walk in closet, and of course another flat screen tv.
Bathroom has a huge shower, and dual sinks. Great bathroom toiletries which included toothpaste, toothbrush, shaving kit, etc. 
One thing I really loved was that audio system. You can use the remote control in any room and place it in ""party mode"" allowing you to play music in each room and adjust the volume.

On to the cons. Front desk customer service is probably the worst I have experienced and I have stayed at several other hotels as I travel to Vegas about once or twice a year.

To start, the tv in the living room would not change channels. I called and the front desk had some workers come up to look at it. They were super friendly and nice and did what they could to fix the problem. An hour later, there were 3 people trying to fix it. I kindly excused myself and went to concierge. I explained what was happening, that I had concert tickets for that night and what could be done. I was then directed to the front desk. 

The employee there checked the status, even after I told her there were 3 of them currently working on it. Asked if I would like to be moved but then noticed I was in a penthouse, so she came back and said nothing else was available. Her next option to me was, ""can you ask them to leave and come back later?"" 
She clearly was not understanding the principle of the whole thing which to me was...I paid for a upgraded suite and the tv doesn't work? Everything should work! The safe was locked, so I couldn't use that either and at that point did not even want to mention it. 
All i was looking for as a customer was for them to be understanding, and it came across to me as...deal with it! I basically lost an hour or so of my day waiting for them to fix it. When I went back up to my room about 30 mins later....still working on it! I checked in around 4pm, problem solved around 6pm. 

When I checked out the employee did not even bother to ask how my stay was, just handed me my receipt and said, ""next"".

The overall customer service is what made me give NYNY a 3 star. I was looking forward to staying here, but I do not know if I would come back. The only reason I would is because of the value of the rooms for the type of room you get. Also, the cleanliness of the room. My housekeeper was Maria and she did a tremendous job! 

The penthouse suite is listed on the website as ""the ultimate in VIP living"", which I did feel the room lived up too, but the front desk employees definitely do not make you feel like a VIP.

I also noticed after reading several reviews, that some people were allowed access to the VIP lounge with the purchase of the penthouse suite. This was never mentioned to me, I was never told about it, so did I miss out on something that should have been included? Once again, poor customer service communication skills.",3,0,0

I found New York New York to be exactly what i need on my stay but nothing more. I got a great deal for a four night stay and thought i would book it. The hotel did mess up part of my reservation but they fixed that asap and were very apologetic. We had free beverage credits which i used at one of the bars in the centre of the hotel. The bar tender was extremely rude and the bar wasn't even busy, but he was rude to the ppl next to me as well so maybe he was having a bad night or even year, i could care less. 

Each hotel in vegas has its unique flair but found myself spending more time in other hotels rather than my own. There was also construction work being done on the hotel facade and restaurants outside which was disappointing. My room was pretty good everything seemed updated and i had a good view of the strip. I like to play poker in vegas and was disappointed when i found out new york new york does nit have a poker room. The roller coaster outside was fun but no discount of tickets even if you are staying at the hotel. 

I did not eat at any of the restaurants at the hotel so i cant comment on the food. But there was some cool live music over the weekend. Overall the room was cheap and had everything i really wanted.

To begin, I stayed here in the late 90s and for reasons unknown, hadn't been back since. All of my memories of that trip were wiped with bleach-bit, since I went with my ex-wife. So I started fresh this time around with a completely open mind.

Since I generally stay at MGM places and play poker a lot, I've walked through the NYNY while heading somewhere else literally hundreds of times. (No poker room at NYNY.)  And for a long time, the only reason I had to spend any time there was Il Fornaio. Slowly but surely, NYNY kept adding places I like (Tom's Urban, for example, which is just phenomenal).  

It was time to stay there again, so I booked a Marquis Suite. Looked interesting. Plus the pics showed what looked a 4 person tub with viewing\/photography bench, if you're into that kind of thing. 

Check-in service was abysmal. The staff was 50% friendly, 50% incompetent. Not a good ratio. They had the VIP check in blocked off, so we had to check in at the regular desk area. But still, if you're platinum, (a) you probably shouldn't have to ask for the platinum experience at check-in, and (b) if you are forced to ask, the person you're asking should probably have heard of it at some point in their life and not have to go somewhere and ask someone what it is. Finally, if you ask someone to see if a higher floor is available, they should at least pretend to check the computer before telling you no. If nothing else but as a courtesy. Jeez, check your email, whatever. Just pretend you give a crap about my request.

Next, you can't just take an oversized room and call it a suite. That's all the Marquis suite was. A big-ass room with a big-ass tub and a lot of wasted floor space. Things you think of when you say the word suite: Separate living\/bedroom area. A place to relax in the separate living area, like a couch. Stuff like that. Like the Delano's suites. Or the Monte Carlo's suites. Or the Luxor's pyramid suites. Or even the Excalibur's suite, which had a second bathroom along with the separate living area. Nothing like that in the Marquis suite. Don't waste your money. Unless, of course, you have 3 other people, a bath bomb from Lush, and a photographer. Then, by all means book this room.

Other things I dislike?  No poker room. Having to wait forever for things like Pai-gow because there just aren't many tables of it. Sloooooooooow drink service at slots. The sports book.

Things I like about NYNY?  The uniqueness of the place. Walking down the hallways in the hotel is like no other place I've stayed. I REALLY like Tom's Urban and some of the other food options. Zumanity. 

It's like watching Hells Kitchen when a chef comes up with a fantastic looking dish, only to hear Gordon Ramsay reject it because it was raw.  NYNY is a beautifully presented dish, poorly executed.",0,0,1

I booked the hotel on a promo ""Vegas Party Scape Package"" which includes 'free' cover to four bars\/clubs and some other minor 'perks'

Well Rok, one of the bars was closed, Coyote Ugly was handing out free cover vouchers and the other two bars I believe didn't have a cover. Only thing we benefited from was a 15% reduced room rate of $68.  Some promotion.

Our room has a stunning view of a wall and the backside of the roller coaster. I tried to get them to bump me to a Strip View room for free, which they would do, FOR $15. Oh well I tried. Maybe since I had the ""Vegas Party Scape Package"" they felt I was already getting a deal. 

$15 resort fee blows. Sort of like getting a haircut for $10 and then paying a mandatory $5 fee to sit in the chair. No way around the fee, outside of staying at a 'resort fee free' hotel. But let's be honest - if they aren't out right charging it to you, it is most likely packaged into the price somewhere. 

I was less than blown away from this hotel\/casino. The location is on the South end of the strip. My wife was less than thrilled after the 1.5 hike down to the Venetian Casino. If I had to do it over I'd stay at a more centrally located hotel along the strip, then you can walk North or South and check things out. This is really my fault for not knowing the area. Lesson learned.

Rooms are meh, ok, I guess. Only two pillows on the bed. Their upgraded strip view rooms get more pillows...seriously? Has the feel of a worn Westin Hotel room. Decent but not what I expected for ""Vegas Baby"".  I'm cheap, so paying a premium wasn't a priority for a premium room, but IF I ever come back I'm looking elsewhere. We didn't spend much time in the room anyway, but do want to feel that you are getting the most BANG for your buck.

This place is really put together quite well

Especially the rollercoaster and New York  street dining area. It's very cozy and very well designed and put together. I'm very impressed

People in previous review rating this 1 star are complaining about a $25 hotel fee....did you book through Priceline, Hotwire, hotels.com, Travelocity??

Have news for you. ALL the casino hotels here on the Vegas strip have a hotel fee of between $25 and $35

Not sure why you would slam New York New York for such a typical charge.

This will be the very first place I come back to when I get back to Vegas.  Various  night stays here you don't even have to leave this place. It has pretty much everything

Oh I'm adding something: SIRRICO'S PIZZA in food area is hands down by far some of the best pizza I have ever had and I'm from Chicago I have had amazing pizza 

I ordered pepperoni and sausage with a cup of marinara sauce to dip in.....MY GOD!....HEAVEN.....

The food area is designed really really well and has kind of a warm rather ""cozy"" feel to it. The seating and the view makes you feel kind ""at home"". I don't think I have ever felt that way about a food court area except here

Oh by the way: Cordell in security is soooo hilarious!  That guy is awesome and really helped me out when I accidentally left my ID at the front desk during my

I was further annoyed when I saw that my credit card had been charged a $349 deposit for our 3-night stay which would cover ""incidentals"" and would be otherwise fully refunded.  Well, I have no idea which incidentals they were talking about, as we were refused when we tried to charge our poolside drinks to the room, stating that we had not arranged with the desk to do so.  Further, our room came without a fridge, and they tried to ask for $30 per night to rent one.  We refused, and they still gave us the fridge.  The maid service was fine, except that they called each day at 1:00 PM stating that they could not clean the room because the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign was still on the door, which is fine, but a little early to decide they cannot clean the room at all.

It's right across from MGM and it's right off the strip. They have a very nice food court of different restaurants and a lot of little shops. Honestly all the employees I've ever run into here are all very nice. I don't recall ever having a problem with the service at this hotel they've always been very accommodating even giving us a discount on the rooms and things to do out in Vegas. One downside is coming off the elevator from the parking garage there's always a very odd smell when you're walking down the bridge. Parking here is free it seems pretty busy but usually can find a parking space. It's your first time here I would keep her car parked and take a cab or walk so much easier. There's plenty of cabs always waiting in front of the hotel. Rooms are really nice try to get a view of the strip . on the top floors is really nice usually a little more quiet. Staying on the bottom floors it usually gets pretty loud at night with people getting in and partying. Really really comfortable beds. nice flat screen TV. No coffee maker but there is a Starbucks downstairs.,1,0,2

Currently in my room writing this review at 2:40am.

To get the main thing out of the way, is that it must be a policy for employees to be absolutely rude and condescending to the guests who are staying here. The NYNY employees have been some of the worst hotel employees that I have ever had to deal with in my life !!

This is my first time and last time staying at the NYNY.  For obvious reasons I had not stayed here before. I travel to Vegas at least 2 to 3x a year. It is an older hotel, and that was one of the main reasons that I did not want to stay here. I've stayed at the Cosmo, the Wynn, the Palazzo, the Venetian and Mandalay Bay. 

Unfortunately, I had to plan a last minute trip to Vegas and the deals I received through a friend's employee discount, I could not pass up.

Cons:
Called 3x before arriving to confirm with reservations that my total would be $198, all 3x the person who I spoke with on the phone said that the amount of $198 would be my total. Including resort fees. Boy was I in for a surprise when I arrived and got a whole whopping  $198 + 68.99 charge on my card plus the $100 incidental fee. The employees who checked me in were very condescending, the manager who I spoke with not much of a help at all either, and basically just tried to prove me wrong the entire time I was speaking with him. As if being condescending and belittling me would ever make me want to return to this dump?!?!?

The ""drink girls"" are snobby and absolutely rude!  One of them basically called me a liar out to my face and I did not get a drink because she said I was ""not playing"" when I clearly had over $50 in credit on the machine. She just walked away laughing and never came back with a drink. She brought my mom a drink, but not me. The manager whom I spoke with just apologize. No complimentary anything from this hotel. They are absolutely terrible at satisfying the customer, or trying to make up somehow for their rude, belligerent employees.

I was traveling with my mom, who has trouble walking around, and we needed a wheelchair. 

Staying at 4 and 5 star hotels, the wheelchairs are usually free of charge to use for the guests! Because of all the money you're spending on a casino already. The bell hop lady was so rude and said ""nope, I'll need your cc if you want to rent a wheelchair, it's $40\/day!! $40 freaking dollars a day to rent a wheelchair when it has been comped to us in other hotels. Smfh!

The first room we were put in was a Madison Avenue corner suite and it was absolutely filthy. Dirty bathroom  dirty carpet. I called downstairs and we were moved to a higher floor 3434 same room. The room was cleaner, but the toilet clogged , kept making a loud squealing noise all day and night and the 1st fridge they brought us did not work. Had to call and get another one delivers to our room. (Fridge was ""comped"" or else they charge you $25\/night for it)

Just seemed like problem after problem after problem.

The heater and AC-Heater smelled really bad, they should probably clean the vents. I felt like my allergies got worse staying in that took I would wake up with a stuffed nose or coughing.

Will definitely absolutely not be staying here ever again!! because of the lack of customer service and care you would expect  from such a big hotel, and the lack of attention to detail they put into their rooms. Sure the hotel is older, but that doesn't mean it has to be dirty too.

Pros:

The fridge was comped 

The view was not that bad

I tried the  $20 "" sandwich"" and thats why we got an upgraded room and ""comped fridge",6,4,1

I didn't use the gym but my friends did and it wasn't anything special but met their needs.

My girlfriend also recently stayed here and used the spa. She says it is overpriced for what you get. The spa at the venetian was a similar or cheaper price and had many more amenities.

""Linda"" said ""mam we no longer have cribs and I don't know when you requested it because we stopped using cribs a long time ago."" She offered me a roll out bed with six pillows and 4 blankets to use as a crib for a 9 month old. I relent and said ok. 

Well housekeeping showed up with 6 pillows and 4 blankets in a damn crib. He was using the crib as a carrier to transport the stuff. I asked about cribs he said they have tons and gave me the one he had. 

The other experience was my daughter asked for a late check out and they said yes. I asked for one they said no. I offered to pay the fee and Cecilia still said no. So I ask to speak to her manager who immediately came on the phone and gave me late check out without a fee since I'm a Mlife member.

This is one of the most fun hotels in Vegas. This review is purely on the attractions and casino floor because I've never stayed here, but I'm seriously thinking about it for next time. It's a great location - right in the centre of the strip, not far from MGM, Caesars, Planet Hollywood etc so you can walk right on in. 

One of my favourite things about it is the little fake new york neighbourhood, with the shops and cafes. There is a mexican restaurant somewhere there which makes awesome guacamole and even better sangria. I forget the name. 

My next favourite thing is the goddamn rollercoaster. Which goes THROUGH the casino and is genuinely terrifying. Definitely buy the all day pass (it's like the price of 2 rides) because you will 100% want to go on it more than once, and then it means you can skip the queue for second\/third\/fourth visits.

I made the reservation anyways and requested 2 beds with a view on the Strip. I had an amazing view of the Strip and it actually looked a lot better at night. 

Guest service:
They were very friendly and helpful, answered all our questions and most of all were very accommodating. As I said before, I called and asked for 2 beds and a view of the Strip and they made sure my request was met.
When it came for us to get tickets for shows, one of the front desk person was kind enough to tell us to check the prices online as they are always running specials or promotions. I thought that was very nice of him.
We were able to purchase tickets online for Zumanity at a lower cost this way.

The room:
The New York New York hotel and casino is an older hotel on the Strip and to be honest I was a bit skeptical making the reservation. I am glad I did though, the room was clean, the shower\/bathroom was clean and our view of the Strip was fantastic. If you are on a budget and are looking for a hotel on the Strip and walking distance from everything, look no further this place will meet your expectations. The only complain I have is room service. My friend and I had left to venture out on Las Vegas boulevard when we got back around 2 pm our room had still not been cleaned.

The casino:
It is pretty basic with slot machines, Craps table, poker and blackjack tables. What I thought was awesome and unfortunately didn't take advantage of are the poker, blackjack and craps lessons they teach between noon and 2pm daily. For people like me who have limited knowledge about Craps, this is a great way to learn the rules of the game. 
Also inside casino is the Hershey store where you can buy New York themed candy. It was so tempting because you can smell the chocolate and it smells delicious. As you know you can smoke in casino s in Las Vegas, NY NY casino in my opinion was one the least smokey casinos on the strip.
If that doesn't convince you,  if you are a thrill seeker like me, you will LOVE the Big Apple roller coaster inside the casino. The roller coaster is supposed to represent a cab ride in busy NYC and it was truly fun and amazing. I loved it so much that I rode it back to back. 

You also have all these amazing restaurants on sites. From Shake shack, to NY style pizzas to Mexican inspired food, to Irish themed pubs, the choices are unlimited.

In conclusion, I was truly impressed by the hotel and like I said if you are on a budget and want to be close to everything (I.e the strip and stores) this hotel will not disappoint you. 3.5 stars. Overall great experience.",4,3,4

We booked a spa suite since my wife's back has been acting up and we thought it would be helpful for her.  Well the spa was great and worked as we intended it to.  We both enjoyed the warm soothing comfort after our days out on the town.  The room itself (1615) was a bit underwhelming and I'd compare it to a Comfort Suites.   Just nothing exciting about it.   As mentioned in other posts, the roller coaster was near our room and was a bit noisy at times but nothing unsettling about it.  We were right next to the first drop so it was fun to watch as people began the first drop from 16 stories up.   

The casino was good and as slot jockeys we found a wide variety of games that we enjoyed.  I especially liked the two different Hangover  games they had.   We did spend a good amount of time in the casino and had fun which is what it's about.  Machines weren't bad for payouts so I wouldn't consider them tight.   

The New York theme of the resort, both inside and outside, is terrific.  I liked going for a stroll down the streets on the inside where you'll find a nice selection of themed restaurants and bars.   The scaled versions of New York landmarks are also impressive.   

The resort is on the south side of the strip and has easy access to other MGM resorts including the MGM Grand, Excalibur, Monte Carlo, and Luxor.  It's also a short distance from the airport.  

Service at the resort was good, Nuri at check-in was super friendly and helpful. The drink waitresses on the floor were always nice and pretty quick compared to other casinos.  Maid service was good.  We used room service twice once for dinner and once for breakfast.  Compared to other resorts around the country that we have stayed at, NY NY had reasonable prices and very quick service.

The only knock I can give this hotel is actually MGM wide.  They charge for parking both self-park and valet. However if you are Pearl Status, which we are, self-parking is free.  Gold status will get you free valet parking.

We rarely buy into the movie version of what Las Vegas should be. NYNY should be commended on their staff\/service ethic. Excellent service started at check-in, and we never had bad service at all. Wait staff were kind, shop staff were kind...staff make the Strip Experience, and NYNY knew how to make us feel welcome.

Get there early, by at least 8:45PM, so that you'll have a seat when the music starts at 9PM. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was due to the lack of proper air in the hotel room.

Booked for the weekend of 4th of July during their 20% off sale awhile back. Room was decent sized with a view of the roller coaster. Bathroom is a little hard to manage with 4 people. Would have liked to see the sink OUTside of the toilet\/shower. Housekeeping was super nice - although we didn't request their service during our stay, when they saw us in the hallway they offered supplies of shampoo, soap and towels!

Additional facilities at the gym\/spa was AMAZING. I'm not really talking about the equipment, although they had a nice variety for bulking and toning, I'm talking about their facilities for when you're done exercising! The girls side had the sauna, showers, etc (there were some tubs, but it all had reserved signs). The sinks had a variety of make up removers, hair ties, face scrub, face wash, everything I was afraid to bring on the plane I found here. My bf told me they have a full on Jacuzzi on the mens side.   

The main highlight of NYNY was the awesome awesome waitress at the penny slots near Rok. Her name is Won, Yes as in winning! She was amazing at making the rounds super fast and ensuring that we always had a heavily dosed drink (or two) in hand. Tip her well and she'll take care of you!

Restaurants at the NYNY are also quite yummy. We especially enjoyed the Nine Fine Irishmen for their lamb burger special at the time and the Guinness chocolate float! Il Fornaio was a decent place to grab breakfast, especially since during our stay we could get 2 for 1 entrees. 

The rollercoaster was fun! Helps that they also had a 2 for 1 deal going on. 

Check out was easy, even at our midnight leaving time. Called and left a message. Then called the receptionist for the airport shuttle. Forgot the name of the company, but they sent a limo! What a way to end Vegas!

So overall, had a fabulous time staying at the NYNY. Would not hesitate to stay here again. But the bf wants to explore the other hotels for our next trip to Vegas!",4,0,1

New York New York Hotel and Casino is only 15 years old, but it looks 25 now with worn carpet, furniture, and matching down-trodden atmosphere. I've had some of my best casino wins at New York-New York, but don't feel drawn back despite generous player perks.

Once you've stayed at a few of the nicer hotels in Las Vegas, it is hard to go back to normal-size rooms, motel furniture, and basic amenities. Even so, I don't hate New York New York Hotel. It is what is has become. A lower priced hotel option with plenty of $10 tables to work your gambling magic. It is convenient to MGM and most other places on the strip. 


If you're looking for a ""reasonable hotel with a cool theme"" for a first visit to Vegas, then New York New York may be a great choice. It also is probably a decent option for families since kids can hit the arcade, food court, and roller coaster on their own. Otherwise, if you are a Vegas regular, foodie, or have the $$$ to spend on something nicer then you can find better hotels in LV than NY-NY.",18,16,16

We first stopped in just to look, and then were instantly sucked in by the pizza right by the front door. It was SO GOOD. Maybe it was the serious hunger that was taking over our group at that point, but it was delicious. 

The casino here was excellent.  While stuffing our faces with pizza, we noticed the ""$5 Blackjack, All Day, Every Day"" sign.  Blackjack was our game, and we couldn't believe that $5 tables existed.  ALL DAY.  We noticed that many other hotels began the morning with minimums at $10, then raised them during the day.

I wanted to write this review to specifically thank the manager that assisted us that day (June 21st).  The casino was busy, and we were walking around aimlessly for the $5 tables. We stopped to ask someone to direct us to the area where these tables were. We assumed we were going to get a quick point in a direction, but that we did not.  A manager (I'm sorry if that's not what they are called- the ones in suits who stand behind the dealers is who I'm talking about!) took the time to walk us ALL THE WAY over to the tables.  He engaged us in conversation the whole way over, and when we got to the tables he discovered that there was not 4 open seats for us to all play together.  He made his way over to an open table, a $15 blackjack table, and had the dealer let us all play for $5!  I was amazed at how kind this man was to us.  I did not catch is name unfortunately, but he was a shorter man who was bald and wore glasses! When there are plenty of gamblers spending WAY more money than we were, we were so impressed to receive this kind of service.

Next time we are back in Vegas, I will be sure to visit the New York New York again! (And hopefully win some more on those $5 tables!)   Thank you for the wonderful experience!",0,0,0

Bathroom was nice and clean as well. The theme itself isn't bad, it felt more targeted to the under 30 crowd and families. Has a floor of arcade games and attractions and a roller coaster, but not as kiddish as circus circus or Excalibur. 

 NYNY lacks any decent shopping, and it's the only hotel on the strip with no buffet (which i don't care about since I went to the bellagio one). It's too far on the side of the strip, and not the good side. Honestly if you're staying in Vegas for 1 or two nights I'd rather just get the cheapest room possible and spend the money elsewhere, since really you will only be sleeping there. I probably complaining because we paid too much for memorial day weekend, it wasn't a bad expereience nor was it great - just not worth the money.

So inside in the middle of the casino was a free party with the same crazy ass people that were at that free bash party 2 years ago with also good priced drinks (mix drinks 10 bugs for new years is totally cool) we had a blast and it was great.. also we stayed at the hotel 2 nights this time since we had my Vegas loyalty points from the game myvegas and it was cool.

This place has the best junk food ever!!!!!!!!!! There is pizza until three AM. They have a great Italian place. The staff everywhere was all so friendly from check in, to the casino, food etc.  The rooms were perfect, clean and I liked that they met our request to have rooms close to each other. We requested on the Internet to have adjoining rooms or rooms near each other.  When we arrived they had us booked in adjoining rooms. Also it was no problem getting the rooms cleaned after  five PM in the daytime because we slept so late. I may be a bit biased because I love the real NY NY more than any place in this world and even thought the hotel is really nothing like it, I still would rather stay in a fake NY than anywhere else if I can't get to the real thing. There is only a couple reasons I didn't give this place five stars instead of four.

Charging to sit down at the piano bar? The guy at the door said we could go in but we had to pay if we sat down. Lame. I don't understand charging a cover when we are already going to purchase the over priced drinks. I didn't go in because I did not want to pay for drinks and a cover charge. Lame!

The TV has very few channels. Yeah I know Vegas is a party place but  I still like to enjoy being away and having a nice relaxing hotel room to rest in, and along with that I like a TV with lots of cable channels.  It was clear from the lack of TV, the idea is to keep you out of the room not in it, so you can spend your money downstairs.

Walking through the make-believe streets of Big Apple, I thought it'd be a cool hotel to stay at.

A few weeks back, my wife suggested she'd love to celebrate her birthday in Vegas so I got online and booked us a room for a couple of nights at this hotel.   It coinciding with CES, the rate wasn't cheap... $169 a night or thereabouts, but Planet Hollywood or Paris were even more expensive, so I figured this would be a good time to try the NY-NY.

Let's just say that the room we got for that price was absolutely tragic.   Yeah, it had a King size bed, but no, it wasn't a Cal-King, and let's just say that after the bed was placed in the room, it left very little room for you to walk around.  The TV is still good ol' Cathode Ray Tube, Pay-per-View does *not* give you the ability to pause or rewind your film.  The bathroom was actually pretty decent, but let's just say the Paris and Planet Hollywood both put this hotel to shame.

As for the casino, it was nice to see $10 blackjack tables.  I'm not sure if that's a result of the economy crash-and-burning, but it was refreshing to see minimum bets go back down to reasonable levels.   The drinks, though, were a complete fucking joke.  $14 for a Ketel One and Red Bull at the bar, and I ain't talking a double or stiff drink.   This was pretty much a 1-shot drink.   I had the same drink at the Venetian and, while it cost me $15, it was poured in a 16-oz glass and had a stiff shot and a half, if not 2.   Compare that to a minuscule 8-oz glass at the NY-NY.

While the Nine Fine Irishmen was a nice Irish Pub, and of course the America Diner provided much needed simple carbs at 3 AM to soak up all that excess alcohol, I must say I was not impressed with the NY-NY at all.   I don't plan on coming back here anytime soon, that's for sure.",0,1,0

I work in a large bank and know what customer service is and I can promise you that these people do not know what it is!

1. The roller coaster is loud and has fake screams, even if there is no one on the thing they still run it and the fake screams still sound. The damn thing starts running at like 9am and goes until 11pm. 

2. New York New York is way at the end off the strip and not near a whole lot of excitement which means you either get on the bus (the Deuce) or take the Tram or walk all the way down the strip. Let me tell you about the Deuce, that thing is slow and the people getting on are all of course tourists and are all confused on how the damn thing works which slows the thing down more, they stop every dang block! Grrr! 

3. The hotel is kind of old compared too many of the other hotels along the strip and could use some TLC. 

4. Even in the Suites you have no amenities, no coffee maker, no microwave, no small fridge or mini bar? What the! Yes, I know it is so Ill go downstairs and pay $5.00 on a cup of coffee. 

5. Our room had a view of the roof and a parking garage! How Romantic is that? Umm, we were on the 5th freaking floor and in a suite and got a view of a roof? Please!!!

It is a sickly sweet odor masker reminiscent of pet freshener thrown all over a wet dog bed.  Granted I am a little sensitive to smells but there was no denying how overpowering and nauseating it was.  My husband commented on it and he never complains about anything.

I don't know how anyone could eat at the restaurants in the casino, smelling that smell.  I got Starbucks and couldn't wait to take that outside.  

Unfortunately that completely cancelled out the rest of the positives for me.  But I will say, in fairness, that somehow they managed to keep that smell out of the hotel room itself.

I haven't stayed at NYNY since 5 years ago, so I can't really say anything about the rooms, but I love this hotel for the feel and for the main public area and the restaurants!

First off, my favorite steakhouse anywhere is Gallahger's.  It's is the same Gallahger's as the one in NY and when dining inside, it does feel like a NY steakhouse.  It's not the fanciest, yes, but it is just good steak.  There's a display fridge showing you how they dry age their beef and shows you that's exactly what they serve!

There's also plenty of other eateries that's legit.  It's overpriced, especially for pizza, but having a pretty authentic NY pizza at 2am in the morning is awesome.  Also others that's a little more ""fast-food-ish"" but they all have something to do with NY.

Lots of bars, such as the Irish pub\/piano bar.  It gets packed on the weekend and the crowd is a little older, but the pub does offer a good Guiness on draft.  Probably due to the crowd and moving through kegs faster, it just tastes fresher, or maybe it is the psychological effect :P

One thing is that the casino floor is a little dark and a little random for me in terms of the placement but it's still ""new"" enough compared to some of the other hotels on the strip!

As a themed hotel, it does a pretty good job in presentation, albeit corny, but c'mon, can't expect real NY in Vegas!",4,1,3

I will focus on the rooms, restaurants, slot play, table games, M Life desk service, front desk service, and much more.  

Front desk- I checked in at 2am, and the person who helped was not in the least bit happy.  It was clear he did not enjoy his job, and he would rather be doing a thousand other things, than to help me check into my room.  I asked him if he had any complimentary upgrades available.  Most helpful people I have encountered before have upgraded me, or at least attempted to upgrade me in any way.  He immediately shot me down, saying I would be lucky if I were to get a room right now.  What an ass hole.  He checked his system and seemed surprised that he found a room for me, like he had to do more than just scroll through the computer and magically find an empty room.  

The room was nice, but there was definitely no wow factor.  The view from the window consisted of pipes and ventilation systems equipment.  The room reminded me of Luxor rooms, which were dark and had no natural light.  However, the bathroom was modern and clean.  

There are quite a bit of restaurants located on the casino floor.  I dined at two, and overall was not satisfied.   (See my reviews on Il Fornaio bakery and Nine Fine Irishmen)  One lacked quality foods, while the other lacked good service.  

The slots at New York New York were on the tighter end.  For looser slots, I would head over to MGM or Monte Carlo.  The selection of slots were also less than that of other neighboring casinos.  No one seemed to be winning much here.  

The table games were good.  Everyone that sat down with me at the blackjack tables knew what they were doing.  The dealers were friendly, and quick in knowing how to count to 21.  (You won't believe how slow some dealers are elsewhere).  The only downside to the tables were the lack of attention from the pit bosses.  I would throw in my card countless times to get rated, and they would come by ten minutes after I had started playing.  

The service that I received at the M Life desk was disappointing.  No matter what time of day it was, the line was so long.  Redeeming myvegas rewards took an incredible amount of time, and definitely slowed the line for everyone.  

If my rooms weren't free, I would not stay here.  New York New York is in the middle of The Strip, and you just simply cannot beat that.",5,1,0

Enjoyed staying here with my family. Everything was fine! Food selection downstairs is great too.

CASINO:
(June 2016) HORRIBLE. Never gambling here again. When I just turned 21, decided to try NYNY out. I played at one or two blackjack tables and the dealers were incredibly rude and unhappy. Their vibes totally killed my vibe and I didn't have any fun. I wish I could take back my money and time I spent there. When I went home, I told my parents ""I'm never gambling at NYNY again"" and they immediately asked ""the dealers huh?"" :O they already knew!

It rained one night we were here, and it was nice to not have to go out in the rain.

I'm a serious sucker for themed re-creations, and New York is Vegas' prime example. Their little downtown shops & restaurants, complete with phony upstairs apartment windows and fire escapes; their Coney Island;  their Brooklyn Bridge. Just charming.

I've stayed here before, and I'm definitely a fan. Prices are reasonable, and this hotel maintains a high level of quality, even though it's not brand new. The inside just sparkles - it's completely mesmerizing, and you can totally get into the NY vibe.

As you can clearly see by walking around the entire property, they defiantly invested  into the renovation. Where they lack updating is with their systems. Obtaining a simple players card at the M-life desk takes at least 30 min. The elevators are all out of whack and I wasn't the only guest having the same issue. Certain floors require a key card to get to but if you place your key card near any credit card or your cell phone that key would no longer work. The biggest mess at this resort is all the signs! It's really just like New York, chaotic and confusing. They point you in wrong directions and some simply just need to  be taken down. Example: The sign in the elevators say health spa and pool access from the 3rd floor. Wrong! There is NO POOL access from the 3rd floor! By the conversation I had with the spa receptionist, they redirect guests all day long because of that elevator sign being wrong. Only one pool access point and that is from the main floor. Once you are at the pool, hope that it's not a windy day or you will blow out of there. The placement of the pool is the worst! Horrible architectural design and a major over look. Once that wind starts blowing there is nothing shielding the pool from all that force. It's a mess!  The 5 star quality about this resort would be its employees. They really take pride in their guess services! The feed back I got from them on this property  is more valuable than any review! When the employees are having the same frustrations as the guests it's a clear indication someone is not doing their job. I will not be returning to this property at all. A complete mess.

Turns out, they've done a half way decent job of doing some small renovations here and there in the public space that make it feel a little less outdated; but there are some pros and cons: 

Pros: 
-Good selection of restaurants from a cultural and price stand point. Loved me some cheddar burger at the Irish Joint and the NY Style Pizza was FAB. 
-Pool has a DJ 
-Cute theming carried out throughout the property. Loved the middle section with the cobblestone and big signs. 
-Roller coaster! 
-Couldn't hear our neighbors on either side.

Cons: 
-Bad pool scene. Where did all the white trash float in from? I saw several people smoking in the pool and then ashing in it, having adult-like relations, letting unattended kids swim about, plus they rent out the cabanas (for $400 a day, mind you) and each cabana gets it's own sound system. Kind of defeats the purpose of having a DJ if you're sitting next to a cabana that is BLARING country music! Not enough chairs either. 
-Standard rooms are circa 1997. I swear, the bathroom fixtures, purple leather & leopard chair and blush colored wall paper must be originals. The comforters also looked to be showing some age. 
-Room could have been cleaner.
-Couldn't check in until 3:00 PM.  Not sure if that's a Vegas standard, but an early check in to ditch our luggage would have gone a long way in my book.
-No ammentities in the room.  Hello mini bar?
-Tub and sink were very slow to drain.
-Bad cell service in the rooms and in the hall ways of the room floors (although it wasn't bad inside the casino area).  We tried both AT&T and Verizon with no luck...

I was rather torn between 3 or 4 stars for New York New York. I remember my first visit to Vegas in the late 90's when the NY NY was still relatively new. I really liked it and really enjoyed nearly all the themed casinos of that time. 

Now, after having lived here all these years and having been in NY NY countless times for shows, dining, and playing tourists with friends, family, and visitors, I have a more balanced perspective of this casino.  

- They do house the Cirque Du Soliel show ""Zumanity"", which I think is one of the better Cirques in town
- I do love the theme all decked out with streets of NY, the outer facade including the Statue of Liberty replica, etc.
- It is definitely one of the more affordable options on the strip without having to go to the ""low roller"" casinos
- they do have plenty of affordable and higher end food options to choose from
- fantastic location on Tropicana  and the Strip and close walking distance to MGM, Tropicana, Excalibur, Mandalay Bay, Luxor doesn't hurt either.
-they recently added Hershey's choclate world, which I need to check out soon


- Some of the staff could use a brush up on their customer service skills. Especially security and some of the cashiers at the cage.
- Those slots are tighter than a frogs a**! We're not talking about 1 bad outing. I just do not have any luck at this place.
- The sports book is pretty small, but gets the job done.

My wife and I have debated staying here but never did so it was a good chance for me to evaluate for 1 night to see if it was worth staying at on our next trip.

While I do like the high ceilings of the casino I don't like the fact that checkin is basically in the casino and there is not a dedicated lobby like other places.  Other issues are I arrived to checkin at 12:40 and because it wasn't 1pm they charged me an extra $20 for early checkin.  I've stayed at 4 or 5 other properties in Vegas (mostly MGM ones) and always checked in in the morning and have never had to pay this extra fee.  In fact a week earlier I checked in at 9am at the Monte Carlo and it was not a problem.  That in itself will keep me from staying here again but beyond that this is just a very odd building.  My impression is that great strides were taken to focus on the exterior of the building despite what it would do to the interior.  What it resulted in is very long (even by Vegas standards) halways with countless crooks and turns and overall a very disconnected feel to the building when trying to get from point A (your room) to point B (anywhere else).

Room was nice but the other things will keep me from staying there again.",1,0,0

The downside though is that you have to walk outside to do that. In fact, you have to walk outside to get to any other hotel from there. That's something that would be nice to avoid when it's 110+ degrees in the summer. Many Vegas hotels are connected to other hotels inside. The pool is also small and there aren't many chairs around it.

The pricing is what first caught my attention when I was looking for a hotel, plus they have a roller coaster so that was some incentive as well.

Casino: Seemed like one of the smaller casinos on the strip, but still fine. One thing worth noting was that when a slot machine wouldn't give back my cash-out ticket, it was very difficult finding staff who could fix it - everyone kept passing the buck and it took a long time to get my money back.

I loved the decor of the casino, and all of the authentic New York eateries.  Unfortunately we were still super full from breakfast so we did not partake in the deli, which smelled amazing.

The free drinks were nice and strong and I got a pretty good buzz while gambling!  The dealer was funny and witty and it was nice to have her engaging the table rather than just standing there dealing like most of the places.

My only gripe is about the roller coaster.  We wanted to go on it, but I had a small cross body purse with me.  I needed to put it in a locker but I had no quarters.  I went into the roller coaster gift shop and they refused to break my $10 - I had to buy something (which I refused to do).  So, if I wanted change, I'd have to cash in my $10 all to quarters, which was out of the question.  I ended up getting annoyed and pulling hubby out of line and we just left rather than dealing with that pain in the ass.  For the money, I can't imagine it's really worth it - we live 2 hours from a real amusement park so I'd rather just go there!",1,0,0

Sure, the guests are younger that at other casinos and the gambling area seems smaller and there where lots of non-gambling things to do (they've got a roller coaster).  

They fail on some of the basics.  They wanted really wanted me to take a smoking room with one bed - I want non-smoking, it doesn't even need to have a bed!  My room didn't have a desk, only a side table the size of my laptop and the same height as the chair.  How is that for ergonomics?  The fitness center wasn't open 24 hours - who ever heard of something closing in Las Vegas.  Plus I had to pay $35 for the privilege of using weight machines probably from the mid-80's, albeit refinished to match the brown decor of the weight room.

The restaurants had good food, but that is for another review (as are the not so good parts).

We did get a really good room rate and a lot of attentive service from our meeting coordinator (yep, it was a work trip), but I don't think the NY NY is a better place to visit (to quote the Beatsies).  You can see the transplanted NYC landmarks - you can look up the statue of liberty's windblown skirt where she adorns a row of slot machines (I'm not sure of the socio-political metaphor) - but it doesn't call to me as a place to stay again, unless my company pays for it.

This time we upgraded to a Spa room and it was worth every penny. The jaccuzi tub was amazing and the room was a perfect size for a couple to feel pampered. The housekeeping service was efficient and did a great job tidying up for us. One downside was that there was an aroma of stale vomit beneath a bedside table that sorta detracted from sleeping on that side but, hey, it's Vegas, these things happen. The sheets and bed were luxurious although the pillows could not handle my big head and were rather uncomfortable.
The table games are great in a fun environment. Dealers are hit and miss but when you get a good one it makes for a fun evening.  
We rode the roller coaster this time and it was enjoyable (for my wife, not much of coaster fan myself, had to make up for the time she spent escorting me at the blackjack tables) for a really decent cost. 
Gallagher's is a must for a fancy evening. One of the best steaks I have had in my life and some really decent vegetarian options for my wife. The wine list was great. Our server, Preston, really added that something special to our evening and is really good at his job. 
Had a really horrible corned beef sandwich at the deli, the culinary low point of the trip. But Il Fortino was a great meal when we first arrived.

She then said the room may not be ready and to come back at 4 (check in time is 3pm) . I was slightly annoyed because I had been driving for hours and wanted to be in my room by 3.

May sound like I'm nitpicking but there was a rolling tray filled with half eaten food and dirty dishes that stayed parked near our room elevator for two days. Just seemed like no one bothered to take care of this mess and left it in plain sight. Dirty. Aside from that, hallways are nice.

My friend made it to the finals and ended up winning $250 bucks.  

Then we headed over to the piano bar.  A man that kinda resembled Yanni was playing the piano and a good sized crowd was drinking booze and listening to him hammer out tunes.  I walked up to him and asked him to play ""Piano Man"" by Billy Joel (I'm sure he gets this request all the time)....he obliges....I ask if I can lay on his piano...he obliges...I get on the piano and sprawl out like some old school lounge singer (think Michelle Pfieffer in the Fabulous Baker Boys sans the gown).  Yanni's twin, aka the piano man, starts to sing ""Lady in Red"" to me....ah, shucks.  Maybe because I'm turning red.  A few dudes from the crowd join in and all are singing this song to me.  I'm the center of attention, drunk, hysterically laughing and being serenaded by Yanni and a bunch of tools.  Then Yanni sings my request ""Piano Man.""  The bar crowd is singing along and my friends are in the corner of the bar, bent over laughing.  The mustache man with locks of Jew finally finishes the song, I hop off the piano and we go on our merry way.

The main floor is a casino but if you go up to the second level, there is an arcade. That is also where the entrance to the roller coaster is located. They had some great games at the Arcade too. You can also find Hersey's Chocolate World attached to the hotel. I think this is a new attraction since I don't recall seeing it in the past before.

We booked the most basic room you could find and it was very welcoming. Had all the amenities we would expect, AC, Cable, Free Wi-Fi, King Size clean bed, Sofa and great window view of the roller coaster.

My only gripe with this hotel as with any other place in Vegas is that the food was very expensive. They did have a Pizza place that was super cheap to eat at. All the other places charged on average $15-25 per person. That's what you would expect to pay if you went anywhere on the strip. I won't knock the hotel down because of this though.

All I can really say about this place is that once you stay here, you've stayed here and there's really no incentive to go back. 

One thing I did not like is that when you call to make reservations, you have to pay for the room up front, NOT pay for it when you arrive. Cardholder must be present with the actual card. If you use your bank card, they have to take $100 deposit, which I thought was bullshit. Then I was told that it takes between 5 to 7 days to be refunded that $100 if you don't use any of the room service, etc. 

We were given our room keys (hotel attendant was extremely nice and professional) and went up to the 23rd floor to our room. Something I don't understand is that they have separate elevators for floors 1-30 and a completely separate elevator for floors 3-38. Maybe to divert traffic? Who knows. It was just a pain in the ass to have to take our elevator to the 3rd floor and then get in the other elevator to go up to the 31st floor to visit our friends in their suite. 

We got up to our room and our rooms keys didn't work, not only that, but it sounded like the room was occupied because the tv was on very loudly. It was such an inconvenience to have to go all the way down to the lobby to have to see what was going on. 

The same hotel attendant helped us and apologized for the inconvenience but offered no comp whatsoever. I still feel that the maids were just hanging out in the room. When we got up there, the tvs were on, but they were on very low volume. A far cry from how loud they were 15 minutes prior. The attendant then called our room and told us that we were comped the ridiculous $20 something resort fee.

The suite was gorgeous, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was nice for the price we got it for for just a night. I just wished the spa tub (that had whirlpool jets) had been in a place where we could have looked out to see the Vegas lights. That would have been awesome. We had a mini bar, two tvs, a killer place for me to do my makeup. The only things that sucked, the windows were tinted green, they barely had any toiletries, the water pressure in the shower SUCKED, the air was recycled, and the bed was extremely uncomfortable. 

Now for the actual casino part. I loved that this casino was not a smokey mess. I wasn't coughing and gagging profusely. My husband enjoyed the slot machines until it was time to call an attendant over, which took almost a good hour. This place has like four places to eat, two or three shops to shop in, and they offer one show. Oh, and an arcade and a roller coaster. Other than that, they have nothing special to offer Vegas goers. 

The receipt that they send to your email if you do the express checkout is so hard to read. From the looks of it, it looks like they over charged me and then comped me the entire stay. I still need to give their customer service a call so I can confirm the charges that they made on my card. I did, after all, not sign for a few of those charges.

Like I said before, once you've stayed here, you've stayed here. Time to venture off to another hotel on the Vegas strip.",2,0,2

On Tuesday, October 6th of 2015 I arrive to Las Vegas, NV for a business trip to attend to one of the most important trade shows of the nutritional industry, SupplySide West. Even though this trade show was held at Mandalay Bay hotel, my coworkers and I decided to stay at New York New York hotel due to the proximity to the venue and the rest of hotels and restaurants in the Strip. Unfortunately, I lived a true NY NY experience, where you get ROBBED and no one is held responsible for what happened. Let me tell you my story! On Wednesday night, I decided to change my 14K gold personalized University ring for a more simple ring to go out for a dinner with a supplier. All my fake, non-expensive jewelry were in a clear plastic bag, including my university ring in my open suitcase next to my bed. On Thursday, I did not put back my ring back; it was one of the busiest days of the trade show between breakfast meetings, more and more meetings throughout the day, my 14K gold personalized University ring was the least of my worries. It's important to mention that every day the room as cleaned by the housekeeping staff from the hotel. On Friday morning, getting ready to check out I noticed that the ring was nowhere to be found. I searched multiple times, underneath the bed, in my suitcase, all over the room before I decided to open an Incident Report. It's important to understand that the loss of this ring is much more than monetary. I graduated from a country outside of the United States in 2011. This ring is unique and customize for me, it had my name, the graduation year (2011), the Country's flag shield and the University shield. The jewelry store that makes these university rings no longer produces the 2011 ring because some many years have passed. This means that this ring was irreplaceable. After a few weeks I still had some hopes that the ring would appear. I called the Risk Management department every day for an update. The first two weeks I was told that it's still under investigation, that they will call me as soon as they interview the housekeeping staff. Today, November 3rd (almost a month a later), I finally received a call from the Risk Management Manager, explaining me that they talked to the person who was responsible for cleaning the room and section of where I stayed. The person claims she never took or saw a 14K gold personalized University ring. In my opinion, it is obvious that they will not admit they robbed something. Nevertheless, the manager explained me that the hotel will not be responsible and will NOT refund the value of my 14K gold personalized University ring because they don't have any prove that it was actually stolen or if it even happen, UNBELIEVABLE!! Definitely the worst hotel experience ever! If you're planning a trip to Las Vegas, please try to avoid this hotel. The service mentality of this hotel is that no one is held responsible if something wrong happens with one of their guests. This hotel definitely ruined my Vegas experience, but now I understand why everyone says ""what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas"", my 14K gold personalized University ring stayed in Vegas!",0,0,1

Honestly,  I did not want to stay here because the hotel pictures and theme seemed so cheesy and it was upon arrival. We got a standard room with a terrible view of a roof and back side of roller coaster. The biggest issue we had with this hotel was the very cold temperature. Our room was freezing and we had to use the heater a lot. It's cold everywhere because they keep the air conditioner on full blast. My poor husband had to wear a jacket on the  casino floor. Our room was spacious but had a lot of dead space. No coffee machine in the room,  no bath ropes and cheap tolitries. For such a large hotel,  the pool area is small and closes at 7pm.  Not sure what the daily resort fee is covering but just another way to get more money out of guest.  Upside is the variety of restaurants, roller coaster is fun and housekeeping was prompt in fulfilling our request. Btw, all the food here is over priced. $4.99 for a cup of orange juice, $4.00 for a small cup of coffee, etc etc. Fun slot machines but you won't win much; I lost every penny I gambled and so will you.

My very first night at the hotel, my father and I went down to the casino and the strip for a few hours starting at about 4 PM.  I had brought enough money for me to be able to safely play for our three day trip, and I hid it in a book in my suitcase and placed that book under another book.  I told my father out loud only in our room what I was doing in case I forgot where I had put the money.  We returned at 10PM tired from the flight and our time in the casinos.  The next morning, I went to replenish my money for the day, and I noticed that the books were reversed from what I had last left them.  The wrong book was on top, and the money was gone.  We searched the room and found no trace of the missing money.  It is my opinion that it was an inside job and that some sort of listening device was placed in the room.  Security came up to check and verify the report we made, and despite saying that """"these things tend to have a happy ending,"" nothing was done to either compensate or show that anything was actually being done.  I would never recommend this hotel to anyone, and I will personally never stay here again.  My advice to travelers thinking about his hotel is to enter at your own risk.  I only have an opinion of what happened, and based on my story, I will let you decide if you think I am right or wrong.
The hotel and casino itself was not bad.  The economy room reminds me of a slightly nicer courtyard by marriott, and the casino is about average size with normal games and several five dollar tables during the daytime.

Check in was a breeze, and the front desk folks were very polite and accommodating.  Our room itself was nice.  The bathroom looked like it could use an upgrade, but everything else about it was great.  One of the biggest annoyances of this hotel had nothing to do with the room, but the light fixtures in the hallways.  I know...'who cares about light fixtures?'  Well, when you have to walk around 7 different corners to get to your room from the elevator, you notice things like light fixtures.  They were pretty large and bright and directly at eye level.  How about smaller, dimmer, and higher up?  Maybe those stumbling around with a hangover wouldn't be cursing the hotel for making the walk of shame so painfully miserable.

As for the rest of the hotel, they had a good number of $5 tables, which is right up my alley.  The quick food options were plentiful, and the sit down food options were pretty good too.  They had a great dualing piano bar that was very popular.",1,0,1

Check-in was 3:00p (check-out 11:00a), and we arrived around 3:30 or so.  We all parked in self-parking (3rd-7th level for customer parking), which was pretty easy to do (and during our entire stay, never found it completely full).  My parents tried to valet their car initially, but was given a hard time and ended up having to self-park anyway (something about valet being full so they needed a confirmation number or some kind of proof of stay, which my parents didn't have then since my BIL booked the rooms).

The check-in line was looong though.  Probably because of the weekend that we went, but it sure took at least a good 30-40 minutes!  Somehow we were all able to get a room on the same floor (3 separate rooms on the 4th floor via the New Yorker elevators), which was convenient.

Room was clean, definitely has been upgraded.  We were in the building with the pink windows, so our room glowed pink...especially because it was late afternoon and the sun was setting.  It wasn't a big deal though (the kiddies thought it was cool).  The beds were surprisingly comfortable.  There was a safe, iron, hair dryer, free Wi-Fi, but no fridge.  The closet was on the smaller side compared to other hotel rooms, but then again, we brought our puffy jackets AND regular jackets (was really cold at night but warm during the day).  There were only 3 sets of towels (is that normal nowadays?) so had to get more from housekeeping.

The New Yorker elevators were conveniently located between Chin Chin Cafe & Sushi Bar and Gallagher's Steakhouse, which were near the food court and other eateries.  We only went to Il Fornaio's Bakery Cafe during our stay, but would've loved to visit Ben & Jerry's and Nathan's too if we had more time.

This is a pretty kid-friendly hotel with an arcade, roller coaster (minimum height 54""), and Hershey's World.  They also have a walkway to MGM and Excalibur so we didn't have to cross the busy streets.  With resort fees and all other fees, our 2-night stay came out to about $340...obviously hiked up quite a bit during this busy season, but still cheaper than the other newer hotels.",4,2,4

Roller coaster stops at 12 therefore so does the screaming. Room was clean. Towels did smell a little funky but I'm sure it's just the industrial bleach they use. Room had air conditioner but even set at its lowest it was still somewhat warm in the room (I really think the hotel controls it to control costs but whatever). It was livable. 

The hotel has everything you could want or need. Really no reason to leave the place.

Stores, restaurants, clubs, drinks, shows... it's all there. I'll definitely be back soon and hopefully get to experience everything I missed out on this time.

Resort fees apply at almost every hotel so people need to stop b*tching. Most places charge more. Get over it. Wi-fi was good but as is in any high rise building it comes and goes. Parking wasn't an issue, always plenty of it and no damage to our car.

Their 2 major clubs, Rok and Coyote Ugly are complete jokes. Didn't wanna stand in line forever for Rok to have my bf pay for himself to get in.

The rooms themselves were pretty nice.  We upgraded from the cheapest room that we had reserved and it was very clean.  The TV would mysteriously change channels on occasion, honestly that is the biggest complaint I have for the room.  

The pool isn't that big and it doesn't get deeper than 4 feet and that is only close to the volleyball net.

A couple reasons prevented me from giving this hotel 5 stars. Even though they stated that the final decision is made by housekeeping, no birthday greeting was put in the room as I requested over the phone. Room service wanted $40 for two champagne glasses (without the champagne). You now have to pay $10\/day for parking which was a waste due to the fact that they were just letting people leave without inserting the paid ticket.

So I finally booked it for an overnighter this weekend. There were pros and cons. 

On the pro side, I love the atmosphere. The designers really did a great job of capturing the vibe. It's one of the reasons I wanted to stay here. 

I used the mobile check-in when I got the email, and estimated our arrival as 12:30 p.m. I got a second email at 10:30 a.m. saying our room was ready, and to go to the keycard kiosk at arrival. So technically  I was able to be in my room at 10:30 a.m. had I been there, which is really impressive considering check-in time is 3 p.m.! I did not pay for early check-in, but it is available if you want to guarantee access to your room by 11 a.m.

Our room number was 772, which ended up being a fair view. It was part roof, but had a great view of the hotel's front sign and the MGM across the street. At NYNY I'd rather have the roof than the noise of the roller coaster going past my window. Our room was very quiet. 

Another thing NYNY gets props for is quick valet service. I have never been at a hotel with faster car delivery. Also, when you are a guest of the hotel, you get in and out valet service at all MGM properties (most of the Strip) until almost midnight of the day you checkout for $20. That includes the Bellagio. That's a great deal and they have it down to a science. 

On the con side, there is no security stationed at the elevator area entry points. I would highly suggest they rethink this, and have security checking guest key cards as many other Strip hotels do. 

Even though the hotel is non-smoking, there was a noticeable amount of marijuana smoke on our floor, in the casino, and outside the property during our stay. 

The dueling piano bar was not nearly as much fun, or as good, as the night that made me want to stay here. It was a major disappointment. The new area called The Park, however, is a very nice space. 

My main negative experience was the lack of a comfortable pillow, which led to no sleep and a sore neck. I didn't contact housekeeping because it was 2 a.m. when I realized the pillow was hard as a rock. The hotel needs to provide a medium firm pillow option in the room. Two for a king bed. 

I'm happy I stayed, but it's one and done for me.",1,0,0

The initial reason for the visit is to celebrate a good friend's birthday. Lots to visit inside the building as well - from playing the machines, getting your chocolate fix at Hershey's Chocolate World, or being sun-kissed at the pool.

Sidenote: we spent 2 hours in the pool area (103 degrees that day)- it was so refreshing! One of (many) highlights of the trip was to actually enjoy, being confident!, when entering the pool- there was no finger-pointing, nor rude jokes, or fat-shaming. Unfortunately I've experienced that back home a time or two.  Everyone was enjoying the desert heat, visiting with others, the DJ music was AMAZING! The best Sunday Funday ever!

You exit the highway and you make a left to enter the New York New York. If you miss the left, you can go right up to the light at Las Vegas Blvd and make a left, turn left again into the Monte Carlo lot and make another left at the 1st stop sign. It sounds more confusing than it is.

Anyways, I wasn't sure how the parking would be since the parking structure wasn't very big in comparison to the hotel and it was spring break. We had no problem finding a spot, and I recommend that you park on the 3rd floor of the garage so that you can go directly into the casino\/hotel w\/out having to hassle w\/ a lot of elevators.

Once inside it was very lovely, and had a pleasant odor. It's pretty straightforward to get to the registration desk...my only gripe was that you had to take an escalator to get down to that level, we did not see an elevator nearby. The line was really long since I got there right at check in time, but it moved super quick. The girl at the desk was very sweet and was able to answer any questions that I had. She asked me if I had a players card, I said no and she was very polite about it and did not try to pressure me in to signing up for one. I asked if it would be possible to have 2 beds (I booked on a 3rd party site and bedding was guaranteed above 1 bed) and that's what I got.

Our room was in the Century A, up on the 19th floor. The only thing I wish the girl at check-in would have done was explain the elevators better. There are 6 elevators in the Century set, but 2 of them you cant take if you are on floors 19 and under. I realized after that the elevators are marked above, but at the time I did not see that sign.

The elevators are SUPER SUPER FAST!!! We were on the 19th floor and I thought it would be a pain waiting for the elevators and then the ride would be slow, but I was wrong. I dont really care to ride in an elevator, and I will always prefer the stairs over one, but these zoom up and down. I used my timer on one ride, and it took less than 27 sec to get from the ground floor up to the 19th w\/ a stop at the 18th floor.

We got to our room...after walking around corner after corner after corner and ended up almost to the end of the hotel. We arrived in our room and it was one of the cleanest rooms. The beds were made very nice, the bathroom was clean and everything was in working order. My only gripe is that they only provided one tube each of shampoo and conditioner, as well as one tiny bar of soap. And the toilet paper that was on the roll was 3\/4 used. I don't mind that so much, but I would like a whole new roll for my stay in addition.

Our room had a nice little view of the pool and of the rollercoaster. I wasnt sure about how I would feel about the coaster, since I read in previous reviews that it was a source of noise, but we didnt have any problems. We actually enjoyed looking out the window as the coaster would zoom by. 

The sucky thing is that the pool closes EARLY, like around 5-6pm. My kids were bummed cause they wanted to go swimming, but we didnt get a chance to try it out cause we didnt want to waste the day exploring Vegas.

Rooms are okay, and you can get pretty good deals to stay here. Service on the casino floor is a little slow for drinks, but our waitress brought us two at a time. (Yay!) The best thing I can say is that the strip wouldn't be the same without it, and I will always lose some of my money there on any visit to Vegas just to make sure they keep the lights on.",2,1,1

I rarely take the time to write reviews, but I felt compelled to write about how terrible our room was. The sink had the smell of sewage in the pipes, the TV kept changing channels by itself, there was a cigarette burn in the bed spread, and they only gave us two flat pillows. I had to ask for them to bring more and that took 30 minutes! And, the concept of being ""environmentally"" friendly is a load of crap, like all hotels. 

Find a hotel where resort fees are included if you're not going to use any spa or fitness services. Paying extra money for things I didn't use was a waste. 

The food at all of the restaurants were great. I recommend staying at another MGM resort hotel and then go to New York-New York for food or drinks. Seriously, you'll see the difference in all of the hotels when you visit and you'll find the layout and gift shops are A LOT better.",0,0,0

My husband and I stayed at the NYNY from July 13-16th.  I earned one night free stay by playing MyVegas on  facebook plus $75 in free play; which is a great reward for just playing around on facebook and not actual spend in the casino. 

We arrived around 2PM and the check in line was pretty long but nothing overwhelming. I was expecting a bigger crowd because when I looked on line, there was zero availability in the hotel that day if you wanted to make a reservation.  When we were finally called , I casually asked if there where any upgrades available and was told that for $15 I could upgrade from a Park Ave King to a Madison Avenue comer suite with strip view . so we took it (or a tacky spa suite for an extra $45 bucks-No thanks) . Upon reflection, I should have asked it any  FREE upgrades were available since if the hotel was showing ZERO availability and there are upgrades, it means they over sold the lowest category (the one we were staying in) and would have to upgrade folks anyway.

The room was nice, clean and spacious..the down side is that we were right across from the roller coaster, which we could hear at night. If you are a sound or heavy sleeper, it would probably sound like being in a wind tunnel and not too bad. If you are a light sleeper, you could also hear the screams of the riders and it probably sounded more like being in a hurricane. 

I think a $30 PD resort fee is pretty steep, especially when they don't even have coffee makers or mini fridges in the room.  We tipped our house keeper $5 per day and she did nice job of straightening our room up when we were out, even if it was later in the afternoon.

All the cocktail waitresses were very nice and genuinely appreciative of tips. Another plus for the hotel is they hired folks of all shapes, sizes and ages. From an HR perspective, I think that is awesome . especially when the image of Vegas is show girls galore. 

Over all, the employees be it in the shops, casino floor, or restaurants were pleasant and\/or engaging. 

We stopped by the players club on the way out and were happy to learn we earned enough points to have a nights stay and resort fees comped...so be sure to sign up for an Mlife account and if you like to play, stay within MGM casinos to get credit for it. ETA Make sure you do this before you check out or  otherwise the bill is finalized. Also remember, if you booked your air and hotel as a package from a third party site, there also isn't a lot of comps they will be able to offer you after the fact since you have pre-paid with another company. 

On the down side, as someone else on yelp pointed out there is a huge transient problem on the walk way that connects the NY NY to the MGM. I would think this private property and they could have security clear it out.  Going from one casino to another shouldn't feel like crossing the river Styx where guests are subjected to 'bum fights' (it seriously happened)..aggressive pan handlers and disgusting signs asking for money such as ""Need money for PXXXX "" if you want to know what the p-word is..think of kitty cats. 

PS A really touching gesture was in remembrance to the victims of the terrorist attack in Nice, France, the US flags outside the hotel near the statue of Liberty were flown at half staff.",4,2,1

Obvi, there was no one in line and it went very smooth. They upgraded our room due to being sold out of the rooms we originally paid for. Upgraded to Marquis suite on the 34th floor. Required a credit card for ""incidentals"", luckily I had one because apparently a debit\/credit card wasn't sufficient. Good thing I had mine with me, not sure what would have happened otherwise.

Room was huge, had a nice king bed and a couch, 2 TV's in the room and a Jacuzzi. Everything was clean from what I could tell. The room was non smoking and did not smell like smoke at all to me like some ""non smoking"" rooms tend to do. The Jacuzzi was big, but once it filled up the drain thing would not pop up so we couldn't drain it afterwards. Hope they were able to fix that..

The view was not bad. Looking out our window to the right you could see the Monte Carlo and the Aria off in the distance, plus the lights of the streets and buildings down below. In the daytime, you can see the roller coaster (and could also hear it). Meh

Wifi (for those who care) worked just fine on my phone. 

The casino and the restaurants and shops were cool. Tons and tons of slots, tables, etc. The inside was made to look like the streets of New York city, with different places to eat and shop, Coyote Ugly was upstairs although we didn't go in. There seemed to be enough to keep you busy for a while at this place, before you ventured out anywhere else.

 The only thing I hate is that the casino was SO SMOKY but I guess that's to be expected. Also, the first night we were there we were playing slots, and one of the waitresses came and took our drink order and pretty much never returned. When we did finally spot her again, she asked me if I needed anything...umm yeah I've been waiting on you for almost 30 minutes...you don't remember? She said she'd be right back and never saw her again. We gave up eventually and went to bed. Didn't have ANY luck with the slots here either.. so boo on that.

All in all, I enjoyed the stay, and because it was my first time in VEgas and I don't have anything to compare it to, this place gets 4 stars. I don't know if I'd hang out here though. Maybe...maybe not. There's too much to see and do to stay in one place too long :)",1,0,0

During a recent trip to Vegas, I didn't book a room at NYNY because they were more expensive than nearby Luxor and Excalibur.  I did, however, do the iconic Manhattan Express rollercoaster ride here-- which made for one of the most memorable experiences of my visit to Sin City!

Admission is $14 a pop (half price for a repeat ride), which is kinda steep for a thrill ride that's over in a couple of minutes.  We figured, 'what the hell, we're in Vegas!' and went ahead with it.  All I can say is WHOA!  This thing loops, twists, and plunges it's way along a skinny metal track high above the Las Vegas Strip and alongside the faux New York skyline.  It was a blast, but I was happy to step out of the roller-taxi alive and without tossing my cookies.  What a rush!

No cameras are allowed on the ride or in the loading area, but they'll sell you photos from your ride for $15 each (of course).  There's also a large arcade\/midway located just outside of the rollercoaster loading area

As for the rest of NYNY, it was pretty much the same as all the other mega-casinos on The Strip: lots of overpriced food and drink options, and of course tons of gambling.  As far as I could tell, the rollercoaster is really the only thing that sets this one apart.

Oh yeah- we also bought a 32oz daiquiri here for $16.  Not exactly a great value, but pretty damn tasty!",2,3,3

Check in didnt take super long, maybe 30 minutes or so. We ended up upgrading the park avenue room to a spa room for an additional $29 per night as advertised through the email we recieved prior to our stay.

So we get our keys, go up to our assigned room, open it up and notice that peoples belongings are still in it. So we're like what the hell.. its no wonder there are reviews of peoples stuff getting stolen.  This is probably the majority of the reason why.

My husband goes down to talk to them and they say sorry and give us a room on a different floor and as far away from the elevator they could possibly give us, which was annoying. The room was nothing special. It was nice enough for what it was. The spa tub had a bunch of hair in it, so i didnt even want to get in it, and mold or crud around the jets that came off when i wiped it with a baby wipe. So housekeeping pretty much does a piss poor job cleaning, if they even do any at all.

My daughter had black feet from walking around for 10 min on the carpet. So gross. I washed her up and instantly put socks on her. Shampoo your carpets once in a while!

The following day we are out and about and go back up to our room to find that we're locked out. So my husband again, goes back down to get our keys fixed. They said it wouldn't happen again but it very well did the following day. This time i was pissed and went down there to the guest services desk where no one is to help you. All the other service people are checking people in and ignoring us standing there, so finally, i went up and interrupted someones check in to get help. She looked irritated but i didnt care. If they did their job right the first time, they wouldn't be bothered by crap like this and then i wouldn't be angry.

We didnt get a sorry, no resort fee comped, nothing for this irritating hassle. This hotel is one of the most unorganized ones i have stayed in.

The only thing decent was the bed. It felt comfortable.

The pool was like warm bath water. Wished it was colder on 100 degree days. I really hope they dont heat their pools?  That's pretty dang silly for the Vegas summer heat if they do.

The machines are tight, but the location and hotel is fun and entertaining which is why i give it 2 instead of 1. I will never stay here again, but i will probably pass through.",3,2,0

Why?

++ The casino itself is large, spacious and offers a ton of table games!
++ CASINO WAR! (let me tell you, as redic as this is, I won so much!)
++ Staff is ultra nice, friendly and so talkative - as many gamblers and guests are out of town visitors!
++ Free drinks on the casino floor when gambling!
++ EVERYTHING is NYC inspired - down to the food (NY Za' or Shake Shack anyone?), various neighborhoods featured throughout the casino (times square, the Village, Manhattan, etc), the Statue of Liberty along with other monuments, and the hustle and bustle of the city!
++ Roller Coaster - that goes both outside and inside!

They do charge an $8.99 per night resort fee ($10.07 after taxes)... includes two drinks per stay (as opposed to per day), local and 800 calls, free newspaper (not delivered to your door, you have to pick it up at the convenience store) and 20% off at a couple restaurants (3p-7p only, however). 

Rooms are nothing out of the ordinary. What is out of the ordinary is the long ass walk to your room if you happen to get one at the end of the hall. Sure, it's a long walk to the end of the hall at any hotel, but this is a haul. It's a trek. A journey. I'm talking 146 paces from the elevator (yes, I counted). My stride is probably about two feet, so you're looking at about 300 feet, which is a football field folks. 

Another con: no poker room.

You can take a tram to luxor, excalibur and mandalay bay, not that you'd want to visit the first two anyway. Be warned though, the tram stops running at 10 or 10:30 most nights. I had to walk from Mandalay Bay to nyny at 4:30am, which while probably less than a mile, is not what you want to be doing at that hour. The only saving grace was the krispy kreme in excalibur appears to be open 24 hrs. 

Didn't have any meals there this trip, but I recall the pizza joint is pretty good.

We drove in from Los Angeles, and arrived at approximately noon to check in. 

The first surprise was that there was a $25 early check-in fee. We wanted to check-in and use the gym, but we were surprised we were being asked to pay a fee to get to our room early. We could also understand if our room was not ready, but it was. They were simply going to make us wait to check-in until 3pm, unless we were willing to pay a fee for the key.

When we got to the room, we were surprised that the Madison Avenue wing does not have any refrigerators.....unless you are willing to pay an additional $30. For THAT fee, they are more than willing to have someone roll a mini fridge up to the room right away. There is a space for a fridge, just no fridge. I gamed the system by trekking down to the ice machine, located at the very end of the floor, away from the elevators, near the fire escape, and loaded up the fresh trash can liner from the bathroom with enough ice to fill the sink and keep snacks we brought from home. Crisis averted!

We learned from other friends who booked rooms for the birthday party at NY NY(out of convenience) that NOBODY had a fridge in their room. One couple had a huge Jacuzzi tub, but no icebox. The running joke during the weekend was how NY NY was going to change the rooms in the future. Would you like a door on your room,....there is an extra fee for that! Perhaps in the future NY NY can improve their bottom line by having a dorm style bathroom, with a fee to unlock the private bathroom in each room for the day. Sounds like fun, doesn't it.

The casino is great, with lots of tables, and lots of free advice from the dealers. I have always played blackjack ""by the book"", and I found most of the advice given by the dealers was in the house favor, and I watched many people lose a boat load of cash from the advice. I came home ahead, but it was a greater fight to stay ahead than at other casinos, as most of the players at the blackjack tables think the dealers are ""there for them"", and they kept making plays based on intuition, or how much money they might lose if they were to double down or split when the dealer is showing a bust card. Regarding the environment, beware. There is a noticeable smokiness to the entire venue, and after a few hours in the casino I was feeling the effects. The smokers are not noticeable, but the filtration system in the hotel must need to be updated or serviced more often. You've been warned!!

The food at NY NY is fabulous. I would recommend this hotel for a destination resort, where you stay and eat at your casino, and only go to other locations for shows or events. This keeps your trip within budget, as taxis are expensive and filthy, and there is still a great deal of construction on the strip which slows down any commute to other venues.

If you are going to stay at NY NY, price your room with the amenities you need. If you go through a third party to book the room, be sure you have a fridge, and a view, and a Jacuzzi tub, or proximity to ice or the elevator. Without the amenities you need, any room at NY NY can blow your budget PDQ.",0,0,0

I tend to go through Priceline for my hotel bookings, so it was nice to actually pick a place on my own for once. I am not too fussy about hotel accomodations, but I wanted to splurge a bit this time since it was Vegas and there are many great hotel resorts throughout the city.

Check-in is probably the hardest thing to do when you are staying a Vegas hotel. The lines tend to be very long. NY NY is a good hotel, but not one with the best profile so the line was not too bad here. Checkout is super easy though. You can even checkout using the TV!

I checked in at around noon so the room I wanted (king bed\/non-smoking) was not available. Rather than wait for a room, I checked into a 2 queen bed\/smoking Park Avenue Deluxe room for my first night.

However, I was able to change over to my desired room on the following day. I just called reception to request the change. Once the new room is ready, you will get a message from them about where to move. No need to go downstairs to change your key card though. Just use your current card to enter the new room. I have to say that staff was very professional and handled my request with grace and patience.

The rooms here are stylish. The marble tiles in the bathroom are classy. It really does have a New Yorker cosmopolitan vibe to them. The Park Ave rooms are quite spacey at 400 sq ft. and are located on a high floor. Because of that, you take a different elevator to get to your room than guests staying in a Skyline room.

The room amenities are kind of basic though. Expect the usual of fragrant toiletries. But no coffeemakers or mini fridges. There is Wi-Fi access here and it is included as part of the $15 a night plus tax resort fee. That resort fee gets you a daily newspaper and access to the pool and gym.

As for hotel attractions, the casino here is okay. The slots are kind of stingy. Knew I did not like Monopoly's Mr. Moneybags. Restaurant selection here appeals to a general audience and priced moderately. There are a quite a few cheap\/affordable fast food options here too. And they have several places here like Nathan's in which you can try NY food as well.

Location is on the south end of the Strip. I would have liked to stayed closer to the middle so I did not have to walk so much. There is a free tram at the Monte Carlo next door that you can take to the Bellagio if you want to rest your feet a bit and the Monorail is across the street at MGM.

My overwhelming impression of NY NY was due to the color of the hotel casino's ceiling.  It's painted black.  Although of soaring heights, this depressing overhead color lended the entire place a dark, oppressive vibe that was enhanced by the pervasive smell of stale, 15-year old filtered cigarette smoke.  It was definitely smokier than other casinos because I could tell my asthma was close to flaring up, which didn't happen at the other hotel casinos.  NY NY also appeared dated, especially compared to its competitors.

The hotel staff deserves 5* (not including the restaurant workers) and honestly, I would've given NY NY an overall 2* if it weren't for the staff.  There was a long line to check-in, but our frontdesk guy was helpful and friendly, even witty.  Our flat screen TV's cable box did not work when we arrived, so they sent a workman up TWICE.  He was super nice and appeared that he truly cared about the problem, and he fixed our issues quickly and followed-up within two hours.  Impressive.  And the dude who worked the afternoon shift at the 24-7 convenience shop near the pool was always eager to smile and made us feel welcome each time we were in there.

Our room was in the Century Tower directly over the pool and maybe 20 feet above the very top of the roller coaster.  Elevators were pretty quick.  Great views of The Mirage and surrounding desert canyons from our large, tinted window.  Bed was clean and comfy, and this basic 400 sqft room had enough space to move around in comfortably.  No fridge or microwave.  Plenty of drawers to store clothes, and I especially liked that the cabinets lit up every time they were opened.  The bathroom was ok, but it needs an update.  Hot water was always available with good pressure in the shower.  However, I found a disgusting live earwig under our bath mat.  Other than that, we found no evidence of cockroaches or bed bugs.  Room was tidied up everyday when we returned.

My boyfriend's conference was held in one of the smaller rooms on the 3rd floor of the Century Towers.  It's a soulless, windowless room and he said it just sucked the life out of him for the 8 hours each day spent inside.  The catering left a lot to be desired as they didn't leave utensils one time and provided no healthy fruit options; over-processed pastries and brownies were offered.

Speaking of food, lots of available eats inside NY NY, but none of the options are what I'd call healthy.  Gluttony is a good sin to have in Sin City!   Il Fornaio and Gallagher's are probably their nicest restaurants.  

Didn't get a chance to ride the roller coaster, but that arcade area upstairs is full of teeny-boppers.  Also didn't use the pool on the first floor, but we took a closer look and it is TINY.

The unique thing about this hotel casino is the ""mini old Manhattan.""  Blocks of recognizable New York street names formed a maze in the eateries portion near the Zumanity theatre.  And the ""Brooklyn Bridge"" is just outside.  Overall, it's sort of cool.  
But if we got to choose where we stayed on the Strip, we would not have chosen NY NY.",0,0,0

Though it is a busy place, it seemed less so due to the more open layout of the casino.

I like The Village eateries, and 48th and Crepe is yummy and priced right. There's a great variety of restaurants at The Village, including pizza, fried fish, crepes and a deli. I plan to return for more crepes! There are two areas of eateries, which is confusing, but more choices for dining is good.

With that being said, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. I had the pleasure of being in the Park Avenue room and it was perfect sized, it was actually bigger than I thought it was going to be. The beds were super comfortable, the IPOD docking station definitely came in handy and we even used the two chairs set up near the window. Our view wasn't the greatest, we got to stare at the starting tracks of the roller coaster but whatever no big deal. It was too hot to stand close to the window anyways. The bathroom was good sized, toilet worked great, shower had enough water pressure and the mirror in the hall outside the bathroom helped when girls were getting dressed in the bathroom and you needed to do makeup. 

As far as the rest of the property goes I was happy with everything. The amount of restaurants and eateries was more than sufficient, the casino tables were awesome, especially our guys at the craps tables! You know you're home when the craps dealers know your name or face by the second day. The pool is meh but I also didn't expect much from it because I looked at pictures before going. I do like that they allow you to drink while in the pool.  Most places will not let you do that so that's a plus in my book. 

The front desk clerk who checked us in was a little on the beyotchy side. She felt it necessary to point out that check-in wasn't until later in a not so nice tone. Yeah we know, hence us asking ""We wanted to see if it was possible to check-in early"" But we got our room early and it all worked out. 

Tip: The room keys suck! They get demagnatized very easily so try to keep it away from your cell phone. I tried to keep mine in my wallet and that worked for the most part. During our stay we had to get the key replaced twice which can be a little frustrating, especially when it's 3am and you're drunk and just want to eat food and go to bed. 

I would for sure stay here, the price is too good pass up.",0,1,0

As with all the resorts on and off the strip, you can tell so much work went into the construction of this resort and it's hard to believe that some people consider this place to be a budget hotel on the strip.

The representatives are so friendly and helpful and it all started with the young lady, who gave me a free upgrade to a much nicer room than the ""run of the house"" Park ave. room and placed me in the New Yorker tower, that had the Madison Ave. room that was very big, clean and comfortable. I was so delighted and impressed and I didn't even request the upgrade.

There are no end of dining options here and many of them are open late, with the America Cafe, open 24 hours a day. I met some really nice servers and bartenders in Tom's Urban and Nine Fine Irishmen. Everyone was very friendly, including the housekeeping and maintenance staff. Even the guests were easy to get along with and most definitely having a great time. Once I got to know the place, it was easier to navigate than I thought it would be.

Just a very fun and exciting place to stay on the strip. I love the southern part of the strip, as it has so much more breathing room and much less congested than the coveted ""heart of the strip"". So easy to get to the airport. Young, or still young at heart? I very much recommend this wonderful hotel. Such a great idea to build this resort! Stay and play!!",0,0,1

Day One:
Scaled down city streets are charming. I love it! Burger place is very good. OMG ZUMANITY!! Not much cigarette smoke in the casino on a Monday night, yay! Spa Room is large, can't wait to try that tub. Went to the Lush store just for the occasion. The pillows are like clouds of chewy marshmallows - can I buy one in the gift shop? Only one side of the bed has an outlet for charging a cell phone (I had to unplug a lamp). It's 4ft away from the bed & my charger has a 3ft cord. Ok I can deal with that, I guess...
Oh but now it's 3am and NYNY just lost a point with me. My better half stole all the covers. That's not the hotel's fault, but I'm explaining why I went to the closet to get a spare blanket. But when I got there, the cupboard was bare! It's *standard* for hotels to put an extra blanket & pillow in the closet (she wails, quietly). You put a telephone next to the toilet, but no blankets in the closet? Come on, are you really going to make me turn on lights & get dressed & call room service & wait around, for a blanket, at 3am?

Day Two:
In the morning, called room service for a blanket. They delivered. Went for a long walk for sightseeing. I like the location of this hotel. Send a note to your architect: there is ALWAYS a line at the elevators, even on a quiet weekday afternoon.
In the evening, I got ushered out of the NYNY gift shop after 5 seconds because they close at 10pm. I suppose they have their reasons, but I was sad. Consoled myself with bubble bath in the spa tub. Tried to do work on my Surface, but the hotel's wi-fi Internet was too slow to open files. Had to use cell phone data instead. 
Seriously, my phone has been mostly dead for 2 days. There are lamps for hotels that have power sockets built into the bases. The Hilton has them on the nightstands. Look into it, guys! 
Made use of the 24\/7 room service menu. Lady on duty was chipper, at 3am. They delivered a lovely breakfast in just under 30min, with a doily under my oatmeal. Thank you!

Checkout time is 11am. Barely dragged myself out the door at five-of. Never did make it to the gift shop, but I'll be back! Those city streets are my favorite.

The casino itself was nice. A wide selection of slots to play compared to PH. I got to play Ghostbusters for a bit which was nice. 

As for the arcade

Wow....

Oh man how times have changed for the worse.

I remember the arcade being really awesome here when I was here 8 years ago. I dunno what happened but it seems they really cut down on the size of the place and let the machines rot away. They used to have a ton of those carnival games to try and win a stuffed animal but the few remaining had no one attending to any of them and for good reason. It's not packed here. I was bummed after hearing about Gameworks closing down and moving away from the strip. The variety of games is lackluster. You won't find a DDR, Beatmania or Initial D here. The only decent game I found here was ReRave which is similar to DJ Max Technika. Downside was you only get 2 songs for a dollar.

The claw machines here suck too. They have some Cut The Rope green monster plushies but mostly Angry Bird ones. Not a fan of AB so I didn't bother.

They have a few Key Masters with Ipads, Nintendo 3DS, iTunes gift cards.

Ticket redemption here is not worth it. Most of the prizes are crap.

Definitely worth checking out for the casino part of it anyway. Not so much for the arcade.",5,1,1

There is an ENORMOUS, two story Hershey's candy store just inside the entrance. On the top floor there is a Statue of Liberty made entirely out of Twizzlers. As you exit on the bottom level, the Statue of Liberty is made entirely out of chocolate.

Ich liebe das Casino, hier könnte ich stundenlang bleiben, was irgendwie auch oft passiert. Das Casino hat das Motto Central Park, der Innenraum mit den funkelnden Slot Machines und den Roulette- und Hold'em Tischen stellen den Park dar, der gesäumt wird von Häuserfassaden, in denen sich tatsächlich Geschäft befinden. Die gesamte Fressmeile des NY NY besteht aus Häuserzeilen mit Kopfsteinpflaster und ist dem alten, charmanten New York der 20er (obwohl ich für diese Einschätzung nicht meine Hand ins Feuer legen würde), nachempfunden. Hier gibt es Fressalien zu ganz annehmbaren Preisen. 

Im Casino selbst spiele ich sehr gerne, da hier besonders gute Slot Machines stehen, die auch mit mehreren Spielern gemeinsam Spaß machen.

Zum Amüsement gibt es in diesem Hotel noch die Coyote Ugly Bar und die fantastische Show Zumanity. Der Pool ist hier allerdings eher kleiner im Vergleich zu denen anderer Hotels und liegt schnell in Schatten der Wolkenkratzer.

Die Außenfassade ist aber dafür einfach ein toller Anblick, man könnte glatt meinen, man hätte Manhattan vor sich. Gekrönt wird dieses noch durch die Achterbahn, die außen herum  führt (und die wirklich Spaß macht!). Auch die Freiheitstatue bewacht hier das Hotel, auf der anderen Seite kann man außen auf der Brookly Bridge an Geschäften vorbei flanieren, das alles wurde 2013\/2014 neu gemacht.

Wir hatten zu einem Schnäppchenpreis eine Suite inklusive Jacuzzi.

I like that it distinguishes itself from the other hotels in that you know which one you are in because it's decorated as though you are walking through the streets of New York in some areas. 

I like that this hotel has a section for children to spend time in. I always see people walking around with small children and I can never figure out why they would bring them to the Las Vegas strip. Seeing places like this make me realize that there may be more places like this on the strip that I don't know of. This is probably the reason they added the Hershey store inside of the casino.

I went on the roller coaster, which was really fun, but when you're riding it you can tell that it's kind of old and hasn't been taken care of like roller coasters at regular amusement parks because the ride is very rough and jerky. I had a little bit of a headache when I got off. I probably won't ride it again, but I'm glad that I did. 

The only thing I didn't really like was the lack of variety in the food selection that wasn't a super expensive sit down restaurant. Their food court mainly had pizza and sandwiches. We were going to eat at the pizza place, but the food looked like it had been sitting under the light for a while so we decided not to.

I'm so glad we did because I loved our room at the NY-NY hotel. 

We signed up for the Park Avenue Deluxe room, and the room was exactly what was pictured on their website. We asked for 2 Queen beds in a non-smoking room, and the room was quite spacious, and the beds were extremely comfy with 4 pillows on each bed ;) We were located on the 6th floor, and had half a good view of the MGM grand, but the other side of the view was a part of the roller coaster. It wasn't that loud, except minor hearings of the riders screaming, which didn't bother my friend and I. The room had AC which we were able to adjust to our preference (very nice!). The bathroom was nice and clean, and not too small. I wish the bathrooms had double sinks, but we didn't mind the one sink. The shower was clean and did not have any mold (YAY!) You could tell that the room and bathroom had been thoroughly cleaned before we arrived =)

The only thing I disliked about the hotel was the smoking in the casinos. When we arrived through the front valet entrance, we located the registration desk, but we had to walk through the casino to get to our rooms. I was sick with a bad cough so the smoke did not help. Another thing that might bother someone is getting around the hotel. Do ask for a map at the registration desk. =) Also, be sure to ask which elevator to take to get to your room. There are several elevators with different names that take you to different sections of the NY-NY building. This will help you with your stay so you don't get lost! =)

We arrived at the hotel around 5pm, and check in did not take more than 5 minutes. Our receptionist was a young, pretty Filipino lady, who was extremely nice and helpful (Thank you Christine!). Check out also took only a minute. Partially because we did not order room service so all we did was return the room keys, and she printed out the bill (just the hotel fee per night). Beware that practically every hotel on the strip will charge you a resort fee per night. This  fee will include the usage of internet at the hotel so it didn't bother me too much.

We only tried one place to eat at NY-NY, which was the New York Pizzeria. The pizza was big, soft and crunchy. YUM! ^_^ Overall, I really enjoyed our stay at NY-NY and am so glad we had a great experience with the hotel. =D

What's nice abou this hotel is that it is in the middle of the strip and accessible to the other neighboring hotels like the MGM, Alladin, Paris, Excalibur and Monte Carlo.  This hotel usually draws a younger crowd without the arragance.

The rooms are among the smallest in size on the strip.  It is also among the darkest lit which doesn't help when you want to look your best.  The bathrooms utilize flourecent light, which I find a bit odd for a nice hotel.

If you are a coffee junkie, you will love this place.  It's one of the very few hotels on the strip which features an in-house Starbucks AND Krispy Kreme doughnut kiosk!

It's fairly easy to find your way around and has enough amenities to run down from your room and get whatever you need without walking for 30 minutes.  The rooms are nice, always have been clean and spacious enough.  They always have decent prices and deals too.   If you have a room that faces the roller coaster, the noise can be annoying, but I think it stops around 11pm.  It usually interrupts an attempted afternoon nap but not that bad.

The casino was clean, and offered an average range of slot machines. The staff was friendly, but didn't see any cocktail waitresses around while we were hanging out. Maybe they thought we'd had enough already.

Despite the small rooms, this is still a fun hotel to stay at because of the location.  It's close to the MGM Grand and Hakkasan and not too far from Mandalay Bay and City Center.  I'd stay here again if the room rates are at a good price.

We stayed at NYNY and we had a great time here. When we first arrived we were greeted by a bellhop and they took our bags off our hands right away. They gave us a claim ticket and told us to call when we got to our room and they would deliver our bags to us. Check-in was quick and easy. We made it clear we did not a room too close to the roller coaster and they accommodated that. We barely heard it at all. We decided to upgrade to the Players Suite for an additional $90 a night and I am glad we did. It was a great room. When it said there was a spa in it I assumed it would be a spa bathtub but to my amazement it was an actual spa!!!! It was so relaxing and we enjoyed it. It had two TV's and a sitting area. Now I am spoiled and addicted to suites. LOL. They have a very extensive room service menu and the prices are not too bad. They are also very prompt and polite when you order room service. The only real issue we had here is when we first checked in our phone in our room was not working. That is why I am deducting a star because that should not be an issue at all.  I used my cell phone to call downstairs to have someone to fix it and the lady who answered seemed to not believe us. I also requested our bags at this time and they sent someone really quick for that. Then she had us push all these buttons and then she said she was going to try to call the room and of course it did not work so she finally sent someone up. It kind of took a while and we called back and said we want to go out so how much longer and they said we did not have to stay. As we were getting ready the guy arrived to fix it. Turns out the phone needed a new cable. Kind of annoying but it got fixed and that's all that matters. The casino was great and I love how they had it set up like NY. I thought it was cute. the outside of it looks really cool too. There is no shortage of games to play and we had a blast.

Check-In time is offically 3pm but they will start checking in a couple hours early for an additional fee ($50 I recall) and you can store your luggage with the bellhop service if you decide to wait.  I arrived around 11am from the airport and was told by the very friendly and courteous attendant at the front desk that if I didn't care about a view, I could have a Spa Suite on the 3rd floor right away.  I wasn't there for the view so I accepted and went up to the room and immediately realized why this room was available......It's surrounded by large VERY VERY NOISY fans and other roof equipment.  The windows in the room (357) look out onto the top of the roof of another section of the hotel.  No big deal, like I said, I wasn't there for the view.  But the noise was insane!  Sounded like a diesel truck engine running in the room!  I went back down to the front desk and told them about it and they said ""no problem, we'll move you up to another suite as soon as one opens""  which turned out to be a couple hours later.  The new suite up on the 21st Fl was excellent.  Same basic room layout as the noisy 3rd floor room, very spacious bordering on huge, king bed, 2 person hot tub in the bedroom, decent size bathroom, free wifi, nice TV, and a really great view of the West side of Vegas and the scenic mountains.  Only thing really lacking was a refrigerator.  Not even a small one in the room.  The next size upgraded suite apparently has one it but not  the Spa Suites.  Hmmmm I'm used to having a fridge even in a basic Hilton room!  Anyways....
The bed was very comfortable, tons of pillows, and really no compaints about anything in the room.  I was a little worried about noise when I first looked out and saw the big arc of the roller coaster where the coaster climbs slowly up to the big drop.....and everyone screams......but unless I was listening for it, I didn't even notice after a short time.   having the hot tub in the room was awesome too after some long days on my feet doing a lot of walking around.  So nice to come back and relax in the hot tub in the privacy of my own room.  
The casino is well laid out in a central location and most of the rest of the first floor is filled with eating establishments.  Being there for 7 days and 6 nights, I got the chance to try many of them and was very pleased with the variety and quality of the choices.  They run the full range from very cheap to rather expensive too so there really is something for everyone's budget here.  
They have a couple shows to see as well and my wife and I saw Zumanity with a nice discount from the hotel conceirge.  Good show for adults...a bit odd at times but very entertaining overall.  
I'd highly recommend not renting a car from the hotel's Avis desk though. They charge twice as much to rent from the hotel as they do from the airport which is a 5 minute cab ride away.  I only needed the car for one day so it was worth the cab ride over to save $100.  
So overall, I'd recommend the hotel and wouldn't mind staying there again but I'd make sure I got a room with a fridge next time and wouldn't even think of anything on the lower floors due to noise.",1,0,0

1.  Affordable hotel prices.  I don't have to worry about giving one of my kidneys just to stay overnight.
2.  Great for gambling.  They don't take my $40 in 5 minutes *cough* MGM Grand *cough*
3.  So many late night places to eat whether you're only craving a pretzel or a full size pizza.
4.  The bars are so laid back.
5.  The rooms are clean and spacious enough that you won't feel cramped.
6.  It's located right off the strip so everything is within walking distance.  For instance, the monorail is right across (MGM Grand) so you can go to hotels that are not walking distance.
7.  Service staff is friendly, courteous and helpful.
8.  NYE - Has a great spot to see the fireworks.
9.  Members Program - A lot easier to accumulate points.
10.Casino-Invited Guest Lounge - You can get free bottled water, sodas, tea and coffee while snack on pretzels, cookies and trail mix.  It's not located at one of their sister hotels unlike The Palazzo and Venetian.
11.Essex Penthouse Suite - I was fortunate enough to stay here a while back ago and this place was simply amazing!  Master bedroom comes with bathroom so big, it's bigger than a studio apartment.",11,5,8

It did have a faint odor (sorta like that old cigarette smoke coverup aerosol) but after a few minutes didnt notice it.  Internet worked good.

As a 'pearl' Mlife the daily parking fee is waived (or is supposed to, we got charged and had to work with the front desk to resolve, probably the only stumble here)

As in my prior post we enjoyed the Nine Fine Irishmen, the other shops, and placed a few sports wagers.  We like its location on the strip with easy access to the other MGM resorts.

The gambling here, like most corporate strip casinos, continues to be manipulated in the house favor (6\/5 Blackjack, 6\/5 Bonus Video Poker, etc).  However they do have a FEW 3\/2 blackjack tables here, so i was able to play a bit.  Craps is a game that refuses to be jiggered with so you can always play that without fear.  I did play some of my old school favorite slots Haywire and Wild Cherry and had fun, but when me and the wife want to do real gambling we hop in the car and head off strip sad to say.

I stayed in the Century Tower and I believe it was like the 32nd floor.  Of all the places I've been to in Las Vegas, this room had the best view.  We had a great view of the strip and the mountains and the strip looked great all lit up at night.

Besides the view, the room was nice.  Had plenty of room for 3 guys without being in each others way.  Things are a little dated in the room so no flat screen TV and some of the stuff here while in good condition was old.  The sinks were in a separate room from the toilet and shower which is always nice.  The shower was definitely high end and hot water was there quickly.

On my last trip to Vegas, over Memorial Day weekend, hotel prices were sky high. I was looking for an affordable hotel, and after seeing Zumanity at the NYNY during my last trip, I was very impressed with the casino and wanted to eventually give the hotel a try. 

Parking is very easy, and the walk to the hotel is very short. The casino is updated and clean and has such a kitsch vibe to it. The casino is also very well ventilated and when gambling the cocktail waitresses are friendly and fast with drink orders (unlike the cosmopolitan). Checking in was painless, their was no line and the front desk worker was friendly enough. 

When we finally reached our room, I was starting to panic slightly. The elevators and hotel corridors were outdated and I was wondering what our room was going to look like. Let me preface by saying the only 2 other times I have been to Vegas I have stayed at Aria and Bellagio, higher end hotels than the NYNY. When we got in our room I was a little shocked. It was outdated atheistically, and had bare minimum in terms of a hotel room. I don't know if it was the 8 hour drive from SoCal or my expectations being too high, but initially I was taken aback. 

However, after a solid nights rest, I really came to apprecitate and LOVE the room we stayed in. The rooms at NYNY are good sized. Our bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. No bed bugs and we arrived to a clean room. Our bathroom was HUGE! It came with a huge (semi-updated) vanity, and the shower was big enough for two people. All the appliances in the bathroom worked and were clean. Our neighbors were also very quite for our entire stay, no loud music or disturbances. 

What I also love about this hotel is how many awesome food and drink choices are available to you, a few minutes from your room. They have a pizza place, a pub, the Hershey's bar, and affordable restaurant places near the check in desk. Their are lots of affordable reassurance and I really loved that about this hotel. 

Another plus for this hotel is that within walking distance you can take the tram that connects to Monte Carlo to Aria and Bellagio or you can take the tram that connects to Luxor, Excalibur, and Mandalay bay. Being between two trams that take you to so many hotels was so great and saved a lot of time. 

Also, the pool is great here! 

Checkout is also very easy. I have noticed a lot of hotels doing this now, but NYNY also lets you check out via text. It is very easy especially when you need to get on the road to beat that godforsaken Memorial Day traffic back to CA.

Overall, after my initial shock of the minimalist rooms, I came to adore this hotel. It is clean, fun, and has that electric Vegas energy, no snotty attitudes found here. I would highly recommend this hotel if you are going to Vegas on a holiday weekend or you are looking to stay somewhere cheaper, if the rates at other hotels are exorbitant.",3,1,1

The slot machines in the casino are very repetitious, and I like gambling so finding a good machine was sorta impossible. I did settle on Wonder Woman though, and it paid out OK... I still ended up leaving a few bucks in there.

NYNY houses many restaurants along with many stores, an arcade, and the beloved roller coaster.

And since we weren't going to use the wireless Internet in the rooms, he waived the resort fee! 

Navigating the hotel was pretty simple but could require a long walk. The towers of the hotel are at the back meaning that often times the are as far as possible from the entrance. 

The rooms themselves are pretty nice. I didn't notice anything that looked old or out of place. The only thing that might be considered ""old"" was the TV. It was just a regular TV and not a flat screen, but if you're watching a bunch of TV in Vegas you're probably doing something wrong, so that that didn't bother me 

Since we were in Vegas and getting wild with a bunch of people in 4 different rooms, our doors were often open to let people come and go as they please. I guess the doors have sensors in them, because several times during our stay security would come to the rooms and make sure everything was OK. Its a very cool thing for the hotel to do but it got annoying after awhile. But really, we can only blame ourselves for that, haha.

I stayed at the NYNY shortly after it first opened and in between that time and now, I've been staying mainly at The Venetian.  However, because I have a younger friend in from London, I decided to book someplace that might be a bit more fun and decided on the NYNY.  I booked a room that was comparable by price and so my expectations were comparable what I expect at The Venetian.  Not so. Not even a little bit.  The 1st room was as old as the day the hotel opened (the bedding, wallpaper and the antiquated TV) and the only word to describe it would be, dank.  I requested a move and it wasn't until the 3rd request that we were upgraded a somewhat more modernized room.  I use the word somewhat very sparingly here, as the the room was in disrepair.  The curtain rod fell right down when I went to open up the curtain.  The shower pull thing to activate the shower, came right out, the lid didn't fit properly on the toilet, the TV was yet another dinosaur (completely with crackly reception) and the internet SUCKED.  

I cut my trip short and left a day early.  I WILL NEVER STAY AT THIS SORRY EXCUSE FOR A HOTEL AGAIN. The price for the room is worth about $59.99.

On the way out, the only thing the hotel clerk had to say was, ""you know you can't get a refund.""  Refund?  Who asked for it? I made the mistake of booking the hotel and blame no one but myself for not being a little more thorough.

Warning to Parents: The NYNY doesn't know who they want to be, with the fact that they have a roller coaster and gogo girls right on the casino floor, makes this an inappropriate place for children.

We stayed in their one bedroom luxury suite.  If possible, GET IT.  The room is ENORMOUS.  It comes with a whirlpool tub that we took advantage of one night.  The bathroom was incredible and having a fridge came in handy.  We were amazed to learn that the beverages in the fridge were FREE.  I had to ask our check in lady, a few times, ""are you sure they are free?   Like it's not weighted and if we touch something you charge us?"".  She assured us they were completely complimentary.  Pepsi, diet pepsi, sierra mist and water are all waiting for you in your room.  They even restocked them the next day!  They also have a keurig machine in your room with K-cups!  I tell you, you will not be disappointed if you get this room.

We ate at Tom's Urban for brunch and it was absolutely delicious.  Coyote Ugly was fun as usual and the dueling piano bar provided the entertainment for a couple hours. Fun tip, if you sit at the bar where there is a machine to gamble on, your beers and well drinks are free!  Just make sure to play a hand every once in awhile to be eligible to get those free drinks.

I do have to share one complaint though.  We were supposed to fly out of Vegas on the 17th but due to a storm back home, our flight was cancelled.  I was alerted to this at 7:30 AM on February 17th.  I was able to book a flight out the following day but would have to spend one more night in Vegas.  Nothing to complain about really.  I called down to the front desk and was helped by Gail.  Gail informed me that staying another night would not be an issue but we would have to switch rooms as the suite was already booked.  Fair enough, I asked her what room was available and the cost.  She replied only a standard room was available and it would be $150 plus the $30 resort fee.  I stated I was an MLife member, maybe there was an Mlife rate that would apply?  $180 for just a standard room seemed a little excessive.  Gail stated she would transfer me to Mlife and I could ask them about a better rate.  Gail accidently hung up on me.  So I called back.

Gail apologized and placed me on hold to transfer me to Mlife.  20 minutes passed on hold.  I figured it's early, maybe a full staff is not on board yet.  Gail came back on the phone and was not aware I was still holding.  She apologized and then transferred me to Mlife.  This time, the Mlife music was playing so at least I knew I was at the right spot.  The Mlife member came on the line, got my information and asked how she could help.  I explained the situation about not being able to fly out due to a storm and we needed to book another night.  The Mlife member then put me on a 7 minute hold.  She came back and apologized and stated the hotel said I would have to leave my suite.  I told her I knew that and I assumed Gail had told her.  She stated she doesn't who Gail is.  I said it was the New York employee that transferred me to her.  She said they don't communicate with the transferring agent....well that seems a little unhelpful.  I could have saved 7 minutes for both myself and the MLife agent if they were in the loop after being on the line with Gail for so long.

MLife informed me that the $180 rate for a standard room was the best they had.  I sighed and said that's fine, go ahead and charge me and let me know what I have to do to switch rooms.  She said that I would need to check out, then go in line to check in, share with the check-in person my situation and let them know I talked to VIP services and stated the $180 rate....Are you kidding me?  After spending almost an hour on the phone, the hotel expected me to do this all over again but in person?  Why didn't Gail tell me this when I first called?  That I couldn't extend my stay over the phone and that I should head down to the front desk?  Why waste everyone's time?  After this conversation, I decided we should switch hotels since it was cheaper at Excalibur and we would have to pack up anyways.  So we did.

Long story short, the hotel suite is incredible but the service was lacking.  I still give the hotel 4 stars because the room was great, the entertainment was great, the drinks were amazing and the hotel really offers everything you need for a good Vegas trip.  But the service issues should be addressed.",0,0,0

We really liked the place. It aint the Ritz, but it's definitely not bad at all.

One of the best parts was that they offer free Craps ""lessons"" every morning at 10am, and if you attend the lesson (which takes place right on the casino floor), they allow a $5 minimum bet on the Craps table (usually, it's $10).

The cocktail waitresses come by often, though every now and then they will take your drink order and forget to bring it to you (even if you are regularly tipping them).

If you want cheap eats, they've got stuff like Nathan's Hot Dogs. If you want a nice place, I've heard Gallagher's steak house is really good (in the hotel).  They've also got good pizza place (Sirrico's, I believe) that's open 'til 3am, which is perfect after an evening of drinking.

The sports book leaves a lot to be desired, especially when you compare it to the ones at MGM and Mandalay Bay, which are in close walking distance.

The only downside was that there were some seriously questionable\/sketchy patrons along with us on the casino floor around 2-3am when we were gambling, but nothing too uncomfortable.

The NYNY hotel\/casino is in a convenient location to the other hotel\/casinos on the new strip.   FYI, our standard room with double beds doesn't have a fridge or microwave, but the room size is decent.   Early check in\/ late checkout was available. 

Entertainment wise- check out Zumanity while staying here, the show length is only a bit over an hour so don't spend too much on tickets, balcony seats offer perfect visibility for half price. Also buy them at hotel box office, they have the better seats available and they are just as cheap if not cheaper than others. 

FYI Latin night at gonzalez&gonzalez on fri  and sat sucks the music isn't really a Latin night, if your looking for copacabana style or Havana Atlantic City style salsa merengue  reggae reggateton etc.. you won't find it there.. mostly Mexican band music. - (sorry if u like that kind of thing)

The live piano bar - 9 Irishmen is cool because of the live music. however it's an older  crowd and turns into a sausage fest later at night. - coyote ugly maybe be a better choice by not by much

The round bar in the center of the casino is the safest place to pregame with good music.  

Avoid the monorail! - even though there is a stop at the MGM across the street- all the stops are really really far at the back end of the mega casinos  and are certainly not faster. A cab is fastest and another good choice is the RTC busses.  (I would choose the 24hr RTC busses which ride up and down the strip every 15min and there is no risk of getting ripped off by the cab drivers)

There is a big Starbucks at the hotel- great but slowwwww -expect to wait in line and don't expect the line to move efficiently like the Starbucks back home. But Still - slow Starbucks is better than no Starbucks. 

Breakfast wise if your not satisfied with the NYNYs selection- we found much better Diner just around the corner.

The reason why we decided to stay here was that we got comped here for 3 nights. We got to the hotel at about 8 PM, and the check out line moved pretty quickly. After the long car ride from LA, all I wanted to do us was to go to my room. Our comped room gave us a standard room. Our check in guy was kind of pushy about upgrading our room. But, I looked at the upgraded room and didn't think it was worth the $20 per night. Once we told him we didn't want to upgrade, he was kind of rude to us. But, I was so tired by this time, all I wanted to do was go up to my room.

Our room was in the New Yorker tower. And, when I came into the room, it smelled like stale cigarettes. (We aired it out a little and it was OK after a while). Looking at the room, it was so small. I almost regretted not going for the upgrade. But, I just decided to settle in. I had one of the worst sleep night ever. There was an adjoining door and there must have been a small party going on next door. I can hear the conversation so clearly that it was almost like they were in the room with me. The soundproofing in the rooms definitely needs work. I didn't want to ruin anyone's fun so I didn't say anything that night. I decided to try to switch room the next day. The next day, the lady that helped us was so nice. She upgraded our room for us for free to the one that the pushy check in guy from the night before tried to sell us. The room was definitely better and bigger (it still smelled weird). Also, there was an adjoining door, but since our room was connected to the emergency stair, the soundproofing was not a problem for us. (I really appreciated the fact that the lady thought about it to give us a room that did not adjoin another room). 

All in all, I don't think I would want to stay here if I had to pay. The standard rooms were so small and smelled weird. The check out guy was rude to us. The pool was also on the small side.

First be ready to be tricked into staying in the casinos hours on end.
No clocks in sight. You are unable to see exits and entrances without asking a million people and walking for ever. Free drinks, yep, so you keep gambling, No windows, so you can tell how long you'v been there. No cell reception in the rooms and wifi is a joke. TV channels are also a joke.  Ok that said, its probably standard for Vegas, i'm sure that's how they make their money.

The Good, pillows and beds were comfy. Bathroom clean. Lots of restaurants to choose from. Located conveniently near MGM Grand and Excalibur. I did win big on one of the slot machines my second night so that's a plus. My friend stayed in a penthouse. Beautiful, spacious, great balconies, and 3 televisions with DVD players (I couldn't even rent one from the front desk).

The Bad, A long rough walk to Venetian. WiFi is a joke. One night water was shut off until 6 am... yeah, either hold it or go to Casino, what do you know, the water works fine down there. Housekeeping cleaned my room while I watched TV, tired from walking, and had the balls to steal my heels right out of the bathroom. i had them on the sink to clean the heels from night before.... I had just put them there and they vanished. Hotel didn't care. Carpets are kind of grimy. $15 a night resort fees ugh.

The GREAT: Zumanity is shown in the hotel AMAZING show. Front row tix are over $100 but guests of the hotel get 2 for $100.",0,0,0

They really should tell people that upfront.  So we got to our ""non smoking room"" and it was so smoky it gave us both a headache after 5 minutes, so we went back downstairs, which from where we were was a trek, and got a different room, at the very end of a very long hallway.  When we finally were able to settle, the room was nice.

As for the rest of the hotel, I didn't find their service through the casino or at the restaurants great. It was nice that they offer a service to hold you luggage if you're checking out, but not flying home right away, and they did offer late check out which is almost a must in Vegas, both which were free services.

We again chose to stay at NYNY, due to our experience last time which was pretty stellar.  Once again, we had a great time.  This hotel\/casino is pretty classy, without being ridiculously expensive (i.e. Bellagio, Wynn).  I booked my room no more than 2 weeks in advance, due to not being 100% sure I'd be able to make it this year, and still had 3 nights for $500.  Sure, there are cheaper places to stay on the strip, but NYNY offers the glitz and glam of some of the ritzier places without the super-heavy price tag.  Book earlier and I'm sure you can get a very decent room rate.

The casino itself covers a lot of floor space, and it really does feel like a miniture version of New York City in there.  Last year, they had $5 blackjack tables on weekdays (except Fridays), but apparently now they have converted over to minimum $10 tables, according to one dealer.  I guess that's my only real ""complaint"".

There are plenty of resturaunts, clubs, and bars in this hotel to entertain yourself if you don't feel like venturing out of the hotel.  I never rode the rollercoaster, but some friends told me it was pretty fun.

For the most part, the staff and cleaning crew at NYNY are friendly, helpful, and polite, which is refreshing for a place that caters to many thousands of people a night.

I may try staying somewhere else next time in Vegas, simply to add a little variety, but NYNY comes highly recommended by me.",1,1,2

It's got a pretty central location on the south portion of the Strip, making it easy to walk around to MGM, Luxor, and Mandalay Bay to the south, while being within very walkable distance of all the new CityCenter stuff (which wasn't around last time I was here), Planet Hollywood, Bellagio, and the likes to the north. Although we arrived quite late (after midnight on Friday night), there was still quite a bit of a line to check in, with only 2 people helping to get people processed. It was late, but this is Vegas - so expected a bit more attention to service to be paid. They also didn't have the room we booked handy, so they gave us a 'Madison'-style room in the smoking section that was clearly for people with accessibility needs. I didn't mind the extra space, and they actually did a decent job of keeping the smell of cigarettes muted (the hallway, not as much). That said, the amenities in the room are of rather poor quality - the TV had really bad reception; the shower set-up (a no-bath setup without a door) had water leak out a bit more without the proper sloping towards the drain; and the weirdest thing of all - our toilet always required 2 flushes to work properly.

The room experience was rather poor, but the rest of the hotel is pretty solid. The roller coaster was actually a very fun\/solid ride, and there's a good assortment of restaurants inside the hotel to cater to any stereotypical New York-inspired needs you may have (steakhouse, Italian food, Nathan's hot dogs, etc.). The casino itself was okay, although I felt like there weren't enough tables for card games relative to how many slots\/video poker terminals there were (I'm sure these are the main moneymakers, but still). Parking is free, which is a nice plus given how hectic driving around the Strip can be. However, just like nearly every other Strip hotel, you get charged a 'resort fee' (in this case, $20\/day) that's not really worth the price.

Would I stay here again? Possibly, but I don't know if I would pay the price that I did. The weekday prices (which are around $60\/night, as far as I can tell) seem fairer than the $130\/night that it gets on the weekend, given the absolute quality of the hotel. That said, there's plenty to keep you interested within the hotel itself, and they do a pretty solid job of imitating the look (if not the exact experience) of New York City.",1,0,0

so the second day we went down to the check in area and asked for a king bed room. we did get it after a lady went ""to the back"" for a while.  this room was in the 24th floor. the room did not smell at all. it was a decent size, smaller than the other room. it had the same stuff as the other room. 

oh yeah the maid came into our room twice....once each day in the morning. like at 9am we were still in bed. but dude i did not like that!  i guess that i should have locked the door, or put that do not disturb thing. 

as for the casino...this place was not happening. it was a lil bit empty. i tried to get a beer at a bar while playing video poker but when i ordered it i was told sorry because i have to put more money into the machine i was pretty p'od! so i was like well then dont bring me anything, thanks. and i cashed out. never did i play again at this place. 

as for food the only place that i at was the pizza place in the village that was good. 

there is construction in the middle of the casino but its boarded up so i dont know what was there but it had ROK vegas ads i guess thats the new club idk.

The girl at check-in was friendly and actually asked us if we would prefer a higher strip view, which obviously we agreed to and she even had her manager throw my name up on their rotating sign behind them to say happy birthday to me!

I loved that they had good restaurants and a bar that were close off our elevator without having to walk all the way to the strip for a bite. I was of course ready to start day drinking at 10 AM, but I guess 11 wasn't too bad... 

Inside our room, the bed was comfy and the wifi was solid throughout the hotel. The layout to our room was easy and parking in the structure near the hotel elevator was also a breeze with their light up signals, albeit still stupid that you now have to pay for parking. We even spent a little time in their arcade which was pretty cool.

I'm only knocking them for one star because the pool wasn't that great... because of the high rise buildings and parking structure, the sun doesn't actually come down on the pool area until like 11, which means all the chairs are filled and it's so hard to find a spot.

I stayed here for 3 nights and 4 days for a total of $100.82.  Like any other MGM property, you will have to pay for parking unless you have a Nevada state driver's license which then will be free.   The parking here is a little hectic because they don't open all of their parking decks.  3 parking levels are closed off to the public for some reason so it's a fight to find a parking space anytime of the day.  

Registration at the front desk is easy because the staff are great.  The elevators to the rooms are really quick and clean.  I found my room very clean and functional.  The only thing I would recommend is adding a small refrigerator.  

The hotel has a game room on the second floor which also leads to its famous roller coaster.  If your staying at the hotel, you can get a second ticket for the roller coaster for free.  It's definitely a good place to drop off your kids :)

There are plenty of various slots and tables like any other location in the Strip.  Your luck is the same so no need to go into great details about this topic.

They have a roller coaster ride which is a bit pricey but if you stay here you get a discount and there are always discount coupons floating around the internet. I have ridden this roller coaster a while back and it was really fun. One of the things I do come here for is the gambling which the floor is not overly huge like MGM but not as small as Harrah's. 

There is the famous Coyote Ugly bar which I think I am going to visit the next time I come to Vegas and all the around the area they have many little shops such as this magic shop which is really kewl and many food places such as New York Pretzels, the famous Hershey store where you can get the Hershey Milkshake, Starbucks and many other food and restaurants here. I like the vibe here and is very lively and it is just a walking bridge across from MGM and Excalibur. 

They are also apart of the MLife Rewards cards and they host many big show names like currently Lady Gaga is coming up. Since it was night I didn't have a chance to walk below but one of the most memorable things about this place was that after 911 there is a gate that runs around the perimeter and many people had tied notes in remembrance to their loved ones and I still remember that being an amazing and very touching sight to see. The structure is just amazing and the details of the buildings look so incredible at night.

The 2nd thing I love is the roller coaster, formerly known as the Manhattan Express (like Prince, I do not know it current name). I go on it every time I come to Vegas. It's the scariest ride I will go on (I managed to elude the bungee ride at the MGM until they took their amusement park down) and it rises high enough to see a large portion of the Vegas strip - for a quick second. It also cuts through the casino - which I think is very creative.  
The 3rd favorite thing is that you can take the sky bridge over to the MGM or cut over to the Excalibur (meh!) then to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay. You can also walk north and hit the Monte Carlo next door. I love being in the middle of things and although this isn't exactly in the middle, it's close enough. Besides, from the MGM, you can take the monorail all the way to the north end, stopping at any casino except the Stratosphere. 
I also love the good deals you can get to stay here.
The rooms are nice - for what you pay. They are standard, but then, you won't need to hock the pink slip of your car to afford a few nights here. I was sold on staying here simply because I had never been to NYC, so a hotel in the design of the New York skyline was the next best thing. 
They house the Cirque du Soleil production of Zumanity - but it is not kid friendly. This is for grown up's who want to go to a strip club but don't want to admit out loud that they want to go to a strip club. 
On the down side, the pool is small. So small, that we opted to sneak into the Monte Carlo pool and risk getting the boot. We didn't get caught, but it was a close call. If a really great pool is your main criteria, stay at their sister hotel, the MGM Grand.",1,2,1

The only real advice I can provide that hasn't been covered in other reviews is that I wouldn't stay in the Zanzabar suite or anything in that stack of rooms.  If you look at the NYNY Hotel from the outside, you will see that there are several ""buildings"" that make up the rooms of the hotel.  For the Zanzabar Suite (and certainly some other room types) the exterior is green glass. In theory, it sounds nice, but after a few hours in the green glow, I was ready to leave.  It did not provide a good feeling.  Sound strange?  Check it out for yourself.  I have spoken to others who experienced the same thing.

As for the hotel and the amenities, I don't really know what to say.  I don't understand who NYNY is trying to target.  They have magnet stands and Nathan's Famous hot dogs for sale when you walk in, a roller coaster and arcade for kids, and a themed restaurant row.  However, it is all wrapped around a casino that is for adults.  Didn't Vegas give up on the ""kid friendly"" thing in the 90's?  Time to renovate?  I think they did...oh well.

I can tell you that the worst massage I have ever received came from the spa in this hotel back in 1999.  I can also tell you that the pool is in a terrible location where most of the sunlight is blocked by the towers of hotel rooms.

On a lighter note, I once saw a guy in the NYNY casino win a small jackpot on the Wheel of Fortune machine.  The next day when I walked by the same machine, he was still sitting there.  I asked him how things were going and he said that the machine was still paying out.  He was smiling ear-to-ear.  The day after that when I walked by, the entire bank of machines had been removed from the casino.

- Check in process was fine. We had to learn a few things on our own...the desk failed to mention if you are on a high floor you need to put your card in the elevator. We asked after getting to the highest floor we could and dragged our bags up five flights of stairs. 
- We stayed in a Madison, and our view was toward T-Mobile, not the greatest to people watch, but at least our view was obstructed by other buildings so I guess it wasn't too bad. 
- We had a king bed that came with only two pillows, a sheet, and a cover. We called down to get more pillows, a blanket, and towels. 
- Room has no refrigerator, which I knew going into it, but still annoying. There wasn't even a room coffee maker, so they really make you pay for everything. 
- There was a HUGE walk in closet which personally I thought was a waste of space. Probably good if you have children though because it's defiantly big enough for a crib, pack and play, cot, or blow up mattress. 
- They gave a buy one get one free breakfast at a restaurant downstairs. For two of us getting a plate of food and cup of coffee, it came to $25 total, which I guess isn't terrible in Vegas. We thought about getting the breakfast sandwiches next door, but it ended up being cheaper to sit at the restaurant. 
- Even though we had a non-smoking room, the floor smelled of stale smoke. I have a high sensitivity to smoke, and wasn't TOO bad in the room, but was smacked with it when you open the door to the hall. If smoke bothers you, make sure to plan appropriately. You clothes will stink after a day in Vegas. 

All in all it wasn't a terrible stay, but I would have thought a few more in house amenities would have been nice. But then again, that might be standard for the area.",0,0,0

We got the room through a deal online, so we got a much cheaper price than normal.  That made up for the location of the hotel.  It is a far walk to anything, which I already knew, but it was not fun hiking down the strip at midnight in high heels.  

The rooms were clean which is most important to me.  It was a decent size room as compared to most hotels and while it was sparsely decorated, I appreciated that it was not over the top with the New York theme.  

The casino floor is nice, but small.  It never seemed overly busy to me and I liked that it was less insane than some other places.  We felt free to play slots and not have to listen to drunk people screaming at the blackjack tables.  

The staff was friendly as well.  I used the gym twice during my visit and was happy to find more than your standard two treadmills and an exercise ball.  They had four or five treadmills, several elliptical machines, and all kinds of weight equipment.  Free water, fruit and towels were also available.  

The roller coaster is fun, but watch your neck.  This coaster is not what I would describe as a smooth ride.  Still cool though.  The New York theme is not as over the top as some other Vegas hotels, but it is done tastefully enough.

As we were roommates in the real NYC for many years, I thought it would be funny to stay at NYNY in Las Vegas.  I haven't been to Vegas in over 3 years, so I was curious if it had changed much, and curious how exponentially more expensive Vegas is now than in the many times I had been there over the past 12 years.

We arrived on a Thursday to check in around 5:30pm.  Despite traffic on the strip being a gridlocked parking lot, the NYNY wasn't crowded at all. There were only two people in front of us in the check in line, and very soon we were in our room on the 21st floor. The room was a looooooong walk from the elevator, but I didn't request a room closer to the elevator so I can't really bitch about it.  We faced the Orleans and Monte Carlo and had nice views of the sunset. And, despite being close to the roller coaster, I didn't hear it at all, as many online reviews had warned.

As far as large resorts on the strip go, NYNY is probably the smallest, which is a good thing for me. I am partially disabled so walking at length can be painful.  The casino, restaurants, gift shop, and exits weren't a ridiculously long walk unlike other places (MGM, Luxor, Venetian). I didn't gamble for long at all, but the cocktail waitress swooped down on me like a hawk getting me a drink in a New York minute.  Lots of new machines in the past few years:  The Hangover, Sex and The City, and Pawn Stars to name a few.  I'm waiting for HoneyBooBoo slots!  

The only restaurant we ate at was the America restaurant, which had very good food and excellent service. And, the prices though high, weren't ridiculous for the strip. Cocktails were strong as an ox and were a better deal than the food. There was NYC favorites like Ben & Jerry's and Nathan's, plus higher end options like Gallagher's and Il Fornaio.  I wish they had a Blimpie like I used to get in NYC all the time.  Blimpie is far superior to Subway sandwiches.

The rooms were the smallest Vegas rooms I'd stayed in, but not exactly tiny either.  The beds and sitting chairs were very comfortable. My only complaint was the bathtub which drained slowly and had the highest step-in I've ever seen. You almost need a foot stool to get in the tub.  The resort fee was extortionary but every Vegas hotel has this now, not the NYNY's fault.  At least the wifi was the fastest hotel wifi I had ever used. Even faster than my broadband at home.  Maid service was good and didn't steal anything, always a plus.

In summary, I enjoyed my stay at NYNY and would definitely stay here again.",1,0,0

The location is very convenient to a lot of stuff you might do on the strip, to start. Although everything is under construction as of Oct 2015, which makes getting in and out a bit of a pain, you can access a lot just by walking. The dining selection is very good; there are several nice restaurants and many smaller things like Starbucks and Nathan's hot dogs. They have plenty of shopping if that's your thing. NY-NY souvenirs, plus themed shops like Hershey's World of Chocolate and Houdini's Magic Shop.

The casino itself seems to be very spacious and in good condition, offering a large variety of table games, electronic games, sports book, and more. There are bars around and plenty of stuff to keep you going all hours of the night including dueling pianos, Coyote Ugly, and much more. You could probably spend a whole weekend here and never leave the premises. 

The less-than-good:

The room I got, a Park Avenue King, was just OK. The bed itself is good and very comfortable. Standard furniture and bathroom, nothing special. Lack of accessible outlets and newer light\/climate controls gives this away as an older room. They've put a veneer of updates on it, but the whole thing needs remodeling and refreshing. Everything was pretty clean, but one of my pet peeves is hotels who still provide unwrapped drinking glasses in the bathroom. We have no idea where those have been or who cleaned them; please just give us a disposable cup in plastic wrap. At least we know it's clean, and not left from the last guest or wiped with a rag. 

The bad:

The A\/C unit in the room was noisy and inefficient, with an ancient thermostat and a loud metallic rattle. The shower temp dial was so hard to turn that I had to grasp it in a weird way and actually cut myself on the sharp edge underneath.

I don't think I met a single employee here that appeared to enjoy their job. The desk clerk at check-in was robotic and never smiled or addressed me by name. The attendants working the arcade and roller coaster looked like they could barely stand to be at work. Bored expressions, looking at their shoes, never smiling or interacting with guests. The dealers also looked glum and disinterested, even the ones who had guests and their tables. I went to another property and gambled where I got smiles and welcomes. Bad form, whoever hires these people. 

I won't return because I can get a comfortable bed at any number of places on the strip. It's personal attention that makes the difference in this industry.",5,1,2

And registration, at 11am, required waiting in line 30 minutes. Also, they now CHARGE FOR VALET PARKING.  $18 per day..  Boo, hiss.  Oh - and don't forget the $30 resort fee.

Notes:
1.  Study the hotel on the internet before you actually check in.  There are lots of great things (numerous restaurants & shops, a Starbucks, food at the pool bar, upgraded chaise lounge options at the pool, a spa, a roller coaster, etc... ) but no way to find out about them from your room - there is no hotel binder!!!  Even the hotel website is vague. (i.e. Online spa menu has no prices listed.) Write down what interests you, and be sure to ask at check in.  Otherwise, good luck getting the front desk on the phone for info. 
2. The concierge is quite helpful, though, and easier to reach, but remember, they make their $$ on commissions.
3. Almost all the hotel eateries close by 11pm, on week nights, anyway. We  got back from our show and the only choices were pizza and stuff from the candy apple stand. Wait - the actual restaurants might have still been serving, but all we wanted was a late night snack. One candy apple, a Stromboli and a bottle of water came to over $30!
4.  Late check out (noon) cost me an extra $20.
5.  There is no charge for early check in!  Hooray!

Would I return? Probably, if the price was low enough to counter the valet fee. And I would know what to ask about and be able to plan better, so I could get my money's worth from this very nice hotel.",2,0,0

Don't expect accomodatations along the lines of Wynn or Venetian (I'd be more apt to compare NY, NY with Planet Hollywood or TI) but this resort did not disappoint during our one-night stay in October 2014.
We stayed here for Red Bull Air Race for one night (company paid--we paid for Friday at the Trump) and had a fairly easy time checking in with a pre-paid room, even though the line was long. The associates checked in guests quickly and efficiently and gave us clear and concise information on the hotel, amenities, policies, and directions to our room. 
The property itself is a lot cleaner than I remember, but I haven't been to this part of the strip in years (it definitely caters more towards families\/tourists vs. the northern side of the strip that's a bit more geared toward the party crowd). The casino was lively and there were plenty of food options within the resort.
We had a room with no view, which was fine because we were barely there the one night. The windows did have a weird red tint which was a little annoying but not bothersome when the curtains were closed. The room was pretty standard--don't expect a massive layout or lots of luxury. The bed was comfy and there were plenty of easily-accessible outlets (which is surprisingly rare!). The bathroom was pretty basic and the toiletries were ok. The water pressure was actually much better than some of the pricier resorts I've stayed at!
Room service was surprisingly cheap and very fast, albeit standard diner-tasting food.  They deliver pizzas late which we definitely utilized post-club (it came REALLY fast!).
Parking was really easy as well. 
One bonus for a Kings fan from LA--they actually had Fox Sports West in their cable package so I got to watch my game! (although it wasn't HD--crappy quality hockey is better than no hockey!)

I love the overall theme of the hotel. Viewed from the outside, you could see that the buildings are modeled after actual famous buildings in New York City. Inside, you can also walk through a section of New York-y places to eat.

I also love the water pressure of the showers. Sounds weird, but I was actually very impressed. It felt like a mini massage! 

The Roller Coaster had a surprisingly short line for New Year's Eve and was very fun. Because we were guests at the hotel, we got a buy-one-get-one-free deal on the tickets. It only costed a total of $14 for one ride for two people! The Roller Coaster had fast turns and steep drops and took the picture at such a great moment of the ride.

What I didn't like about staying at the New York New York was its housekeeping services. Room cleaners will actually never come to your room unless you call for them. My family learned that the hard way after our tiny trash cans started to overflow. Unfortunately, after one room cleaning service, my extremely expensive retainer was missing. Myself and everyone staying in the same room with me recalled seeing my retainer in a clear cup in the bathroom. I had put that cup on the opposite side of the bathroom counter to signal that I intended to keep it. But later, the cup and my retainer were gone. Also, after each service, we found the thermostat on full blast on the coldest setting. In the winter!

I had to check out soon, so I didn't have the time to notify the hotel. But, I highly doubt anybody working here would have made the effort to search for my retainer.

This is the reason I am rating New York New York Hotel & Casino just 2 stars. Housekeeping does its job too poorly to overlook. 

A note to others: Make sure you close your suitcases and seal all bags before calling room service. Organize your items in one area and take a picture as proof in the event of anything going missing.

My husband and I came here expecting a decent hotel with a great view (we paid for an upgraded room and then paid additional for a view of the strip). $150\/nt (after tax\/resort fee) on a Thursday on the Vegas strip for a hotel of this quality was apparently way too much. 

Good: The person checking us in was friendly and helpful with questions we had about the area. The location was really special. The theme inside the hotel common areas was adorable and was a great thing for us to see. Check-out was super fast, dropped our keys in a box by the elevator. WiFi was good\/fast. We only stayed there one night so it didn't manage to ruin our whole vacation.

Bad: Price for the quality (way too much $). Paying extra got us nothing extra. Our ""view"" was of the rooftop of the lower floors and the roller coaster which was plenty loud (luckily it closed at 11pm, but still really obstructed the view we paid for). Our ""upgraded\/recently updated"" room got us nothing : no coffee maker, no fridge, wallpaper peeling off of the walls. And okay, ignore all that an I just want a clean place to rest my head. But this was not that either. Didn't take showers because I saw a few curly black hairs lingering in our tub so good call there. Couldn't walk around the room without socks on (I guess that's pretty typical in a hotel) but I was even a little uncomfortable taking off my shoes. Do you ever vacuum\/shampoo this carpet? 

This place was so sad and old. I had such a great first impression but I guess I shouldn't have let that fool me. Next time we won't be staying on the strip for fear that the experience will be like this again. Gosh I hope the real New York isn't so bad....",0,0,0

 We generally stay off the strip at Red Rock but decided to shake things up and stay on the strip. I'm a pinball geek and the deciding factor for staying and gambling at NYNY was the new, well maintained pinball machines in the arcade.

 Terra (sp?) checked us in flawlessly and was over the top cheerful and personable. We get to our room and are thrilled to see that we got a corner strip view. The room, and for that matter, the entire casino was spotless. Our cable went out in the middle of the Masters, which we had bets on. Called the front desk and within minutes, Lamont was at our room and fixed the problem. He couldn't have been nicer.

 Really liked the Flintstones, Rolling Stones and other newer slots. We originally had booked three nights but were having such a blast, we added two more nights. Couldn't get enough of Bruxies and other eateries in and around NYNY. Also, the guy that sings at the main bar is a hoot.

The pros is the location right next to the T-mobile Arena if you're there for an event and it was easy to get to just about anywhere for other attractions from NYNY in Vegas.

The cons is that the rooms are feeling old.  The electric outlets were very worn and some of my AC adapters for the electronics had a tough time staying in since they were so loose.  The rooms did not feel as modern as I expected from a bigger hotel on the strip.  I was a bit disappointed with the size of the bathroom, considering that I upgraded to a suite.

The rates have gone down considerable which made me worry just a bit but after spending 3 nights here, I say it's a bargain (especially for families).

I booked a Park Ave. room, non-smoking with a king bed...they gave us two queens instead because they didn't have a king available & asked if we wanted to switch in the morning - I said we'd just stay with two queens since I didn't feel like moving around.  Here's the good & bad of our stay:

The GOOD!:
*Clean room & bathroom - our room was at the very, very end of the hallway...kind of a walk but that's fine with me since it seems to be more quiet the further away you are from the elevator.  Bathroom was also very nice...had marble floors, clean sink area & shower was nice as well.  Everything in the bathroom seemed new...room also had ipod docking station which is nice

*Arcade & gambling - for families, there's an arcade area where you can play games and win tickets, which is something nice to do to keep you out of the harsh temperatures.  There's also the rollercoaster but I hear it's expensive so we didn't give it a try.  The slots are just ok here...they don't have some of the newer ones here & I think you'll have better luck playing in the daytime rather than at night.  

*Restaurants - good selection of restaurants & lots of noisy fun; there's a section that's meant to look like the streets of NY with cheaper food options like pizza, fish & chips, sandwiches, etc.  Also has two Starbucks, Haagen Das and sells Krispy Kreme doughnuts - if they had an in-n-out inside I would not have left the hotel.  =)  We tried the pizza place at about 1am...it was fantastic!  Lots of restaurants and drinking to choose from as well - tried Gallagher's Steakhouse and thought food was excellent for the price.  The Bar at Times Square has nightly rowdiness because of the piano bar - seemed like a lot of fun

*Easy access to...MGM & Excalibur.  MGM has good restaurants & the monorail station that takes you northbound all the way to the Sahara.  One ride is $5, one day is $12 - a good way for you to get to places like the Venetian, Paris, Harrah's & the Wynn.  If you go to Excalibur, there's a free monorail ride to Luxor & Mandalay Bay; love the restaurants in Mandalay Bay too so I enjoyed the easy transportation to different parts of the strip.


The Not-So-Good:
*Blankets - the comforters & blankets on the bed are old and thin...would be nice to get something a bit more plush.  

*Old box TV - why do hotels still have these?  Everyone should upgrade to flat-screens.

*In-room safe did not work for us

*No sliding closet in the room...instead had a wooden wardrobe which housed the iron & ironing board.  Not a big deal to me though.

*Not having the room I booked for me.  I make a reservation for a reason - to have this particular room ready for me & when I check-in, it's not available?  that's the reason we make reservations!

*A resort fee of 12.95 a day.  The new trend is to charge resort fees...daily fees that include crap stuff that should already be included in the price of the hotel!  Why not just bump up the price & include these imposed services in the room\/hotel description.  $12.95 is not bad compared to some other hotels & at least it includes internet access but we did not get the newspaper and I would have preferred bottles of water instead of cocktail vouchers.  

Overall, I would stay here again.  Like I said, the rates have lowered & it's a pretty good value for the hotel.  With taxes, room rates and resort fee, it's probably $80-100 a night...& if you stay with other people it can be a pretty good deal.  Get the pizza!  =)",5,3,2

Every trip to Vegas requires a trip here. The casino floor is just big enough to have room for everyone (except on the busiest of nights in Vegas). The location is perfect with cheaper casinos within easy striking distance.

Called for early check in a few days before we arrived. We asked for a view of the strip from our room and Monica working the front desk hooked us up! We had a wonderful corner room that had 2 walls of windows showing a view of the strip in both directions! Bed was  nice. Cleaning lady forgot to pull out desk chair to remove some cake crumbs...Other than that the room was clean and spacious enough. The pool was great, good music and cold drinks. NY NY had a good selection of low to medium priced venues to eat at, but no upscale restaurants. When we needed a replacement iron, house keeping was there in about 35 minutes, not too bad for such a huge hotel. Gaming floor could have been a little bigger but never had to look long for free slots or tables. I liked the very high ceilings over the gaming floor. This hotel is one of the few that tries to cater to families and couples\singles. Located in a busy part of the strip theres lots to see and do in the immediate area. If you are looking for a nice spot to stay that doesn't cost an arm and a leg consider NY NY, especially if you're traveling with kids. My wife and I had a blast and I can't wait to come back and if I bring my kids we'll stay at NY NY.",0,0,0

Hubby received a promotional code for $49 per night stay here and couldn't resist so off we went. We stayed here once before but I don't recall the experience but this time around, I will definitely remember it since I am also yelping about it.

Yea, I don't think I'll be staying here again unless it is for free. The rooms have NO insulation to block out any noises. I mean ANY noises!  I was woken up at 1:30 am to a moaning neighbor...(yes, pretty gross). The number one thing I hate, when I am in my REM sleep! I mean what if I had a family with kids...that would be horrid! The walls in the rooms are so thin, you can hear every word in conversation if people were not whispering, you can hear water running, like everyone was in the same room.

Besides the thin walls, I don't know how well they clean. I won't go into details but I saw some left over stain on the bathroom walls ( I will let your imagination roll with this). If I think about it too much, I think I'll throw up. =P

I wanted to give this hotel a four star, but the bathroom took one star out. While the room itself doesn't, the bathroom shows the age of the hotel. The sink is small and old. Cold & Hot water knobs were confusing!! We never got the right direction for opening and closing the knobs - LOL. I felt the bathtub was kind of odd with a heavy glass door, which was hard to open. The tub was deep so you'd have to bring your legs up. Otherwise you'll hit your knees with the door frame (ouch!). I like taking a bath, and am a bit picky about the tub...

The only good thing I can say is:  the showers get hot quickly. Otherwise, the design is poor, the rooms are small , the acoustics are poor, some of the rooms are dark. Depending upon what tower you are in (I was in the 'Chrysler"" building-  VERY small windows) you either have a view or you look @ a parking lot.

When the rollercoaster runs  you can hear it-  the screams, the cars on the track- and it can interfere with sleep. The fire alarm was set off when I was there and for 10 minutes a BLARING message was PA'ed into the rooms warning us of a possible emergency.

First off, we pulled up to the valet and there was no one working, I stopped my car got out and walked around looking for someone to take my car.  I looked around and couldn't find anyone so I figured screw it, I'll self park, it's not far.  As we drove out of the valet area there was at least 40 people waiting for their cars.

We park and walk to registration.  There wasn't a large line by any means, maybe 6 people in front of us and 4 employees working the counter.  It took almost 30 minutes to make our way to the counter, once there the room reserved was no longer available so the guy upgraded us.  We originally reserved a Park Ave room which is just above the standard room, the clerk told us he put us in the Broadway room which was a level up from that.  All was fine and dandy until we got to our 'room?'.  Ever been on an Indian reservation?  Well me either until I got to my room.  The indian theme was pretty tacky but the purple pleather chair with tiger stipe seat cushion really pushed made it incredible awful.  The room was big enough for an after party but I mean even Motel 6's have coffee makers in the rooms...

I can say for a room that runs $400 for a Friday and Saturday it's definitely, DEFINITELY not worth it.  We got a good rate, that's the only thing I can say I came away with from this stay.",0,0,0

Details: 
We came here for a friend's surprise proposal. So there was like 10 of us that were staying at this hotel. We arrived after everyone else and when we originally checked in we got the 6th floor and some tower on the other side (no where near our friends).  
We decided to go back and ask if there was anyway we could stay on the same floor or at least the same tower as our friends (21st floor\/century tower). We had a clerk name Laurie (or Lori) she was super nice and not only did she get us a floor close to them (20th floor) she upgraded our rooms from the park avenue to the Madison avenue deluxe for free! Our room was handicap accessible so it was so spacious! It was huge! Also right next to the elevators. #winning

Our room quickly became the room for everyone to come hang out in. 
Such a great experience thanks to Laurie! She helped us out and was super nice. I will defiantly come back and stay here. 

We also uses the valet and baggage claim. The baggage claim was great when we go there but lacked organization when we departed. (They came to the room to get our bags and we were told we come get them later when we're ready to leave. ) well we went to give them the ticket to bring out the bags and then went to valet to wait for our car. Our car came out first. And we wait a total of like 30 min for our luggage (I went twice to go see what the hold up was) 
Turns out they couldn't find our luggage so they had me go in the back to identify my belongings. It was just a little annoying. 

Overall still a great experience.",1,0,1

I was incredibly charmed by the miniature city with the cobble stone streets, the manhole covers, and street lights.

Walking from self-parking down into the casino, if you stop to use the restroom, you'll see signs for ""Central Park"" and ""Bryant Park"", which was a bit surreal. On the casino floor we walked through areas which felt like mini\/Hollywood versions of the village. We parked here first before walking around to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay, and we walked over the ""Brooklyn Bridge"" on our way there. I can't say I'm a fan of the fake NYC stuff, the fake Arc De Triumph and Eiffel Tower at Paris; it just creeps me out.

The casino floor was pretty nice though. Later we came back to eat and do some slots before heading over to Penn and Teller, and ate at the Bar at Times Square. For the strip, they had a good happy hour: $5 drinks and 50% of food, which meant $7.50 cheeseburgers and fries. The kitchen messed up the hubby's burger order, and the bartender was very nice about getting a new one and comped us one drink. They were very nice, and the food was pretty good. And most of the other HH's we saw were drinks only.

So: creepy, nice floor, good HH at the Bar at Times Square! Kinda wish we had done Zumanity too, looked cool!",1,2,2

Its not the nicest, fanciest bathroom but i like it because instead of the flimsy modular metal stalls that separate the bowls, they have solid doors that go all the way to the floor with out gaps at the hinges and bottom.  So you don't have to worry about what sounds may come out of your stall, you can just let er' rip!  
The stalls also have an occupied or vacant indicator, like on an airplane bathroom, so you don't have to turn your neck and to see if someone's feet are in the stall to figure out if its occupied or not!  GENIUS!

What i also like about NY NY is they are green, bathroom has the Dyson Air Blade, swipe your hands in and out 2 or 3 times and they are dry!  no paper towels needed!  Trash cans around the casino say ""we recycle your bottles for you""

1. Entertainment- With a cirque show (Zumanity) an irish bar, a piano bar, coyote ugly, and a nightclub (ROK), you won't know how to split your time equally amongst the choices. Plus they have a roller coaster and arcade for the kids.

2. Deals- Sign up for a players card if you are going to gamble. The NYNY marketing team is very generous with their offers. I got 2 free nights, 50 dollars in free play on the slots, and 2 for 1 mgm show tickets on opening NCAA Tourney weekend with out having to lose the t-shirt off my back. The only stipulation is to get GOOD deals you must bet at least 15-30 dollars a hand consistently.
 
3. Location. Directly across from the MGM where you can take the monorail all the way to the North End of the strip. Also a 5 minute walk to the City Center. Also if you are renting a car, the parking garage here is conveniently located to the freeways for easy access to off the strip adventures.

4. ETC. Newly renovated rooms, (ask for one closest to the elevators) good sportsbook, tons of food options from italian to mexican to japanese at good prices, nice employees,  and a great atmosphere.

Avoid the room service menu, the food comes from the America restaurant (see my other review). You're better off walking (staggering) to the Il Fornaio cafe or something like that.

It's modeled after a NY city street, complete with a cobblestone path, manhole covers, bright lights, brick buildings, and cafes. You don't quite feel like you're really in NY but it makes for a cool setting when you're grabbing a bite or just passing through.

However, I didn't care much for the casino or the four elevators placed at opposite corners of the building. How chaotic!

It seems like the staff is not happy because they act like they don't care for your business. From check in, to just the general staff. 

     Later my wife and I decided to go gamble downstairs and after spending about an hour at the table, not one single person approach us for a drink. I even started waving down waitresses who kept telling me that they did not service area I was in.This was two days in a row and we were drier than the desert itself. Worst part is I got up and lost my table to go get a drink and when I asked him for a common beer like Shocktop, the bartender told me they didn't serve it and I had to get it from another bar across the casino. He told me I'd find it under a certain sign but when I got to that sign everything was closed. From there we decided to no longer gamble in the hotel. There is definitely some other hotel that would appreciate our money. Later that night my daughter got a little sick and her throat was hurting, I called downstairs to see if they could send up some sugar so we can sweeten some hot tea that we made for her and and we explained it was for my daugter. They wanted to charge me $7 dollars to bring it up to me. I asked if I could come Down and get it and they tell me know that I would have to find some at either one of the coffee shops or a restaurant. Seriously? What kind of crap is that? The rooms were nice and spacious but even the beds were uncomfortable. I felt like that episode of I Love Lucy where Ricky and Lucy have to type themselves to the edge of the bed because the bed has a big dip in it. And the Internet is horrendous. I swear DialUp with AOL is faster than the Internet at this hotel and you're forced to pay $18 as a ""resort fee"". What a serious rip off, every time I tried downloading a file from work it would lag and I would have to start over. Just browsing the web was a joke.The only time I actually complained to anyone was about the gambling with no one approaching us for drinks. I actually had to tweet someone to get a response, but the only response I got was ""I apologize and I'll forward this message to the manager"". Whether they did it or not I have no clue. I would seriously suggest staying in a different hotel, some where that not only appreciates you as a guest, but treats you like one. Overall my experience with this hotel was horrible.

Parking was easy to find.  However, they have drivers roll down their windows before entering into the parking lot due to the possibility of inspection.  I didn't see any other hotel do this, so it was a bit of a puzzlement on what they were hoping to do by stopping cars, especially when it led to backup traffic.  

Check-In was simple.  We already had our rooms reserved, and we were able to get our Park Avenue room with a king-size bed and nonsmoking with no problems.  We also booked the room for Mon-Thurs, so this might have had an affect on which rooms we had.

I loved the consistency of the theme of NYNY through every part of the hotel.  When we visited the other hotels, I didn't see the consistency as much.  Then again, a them of ""New York"" should be more easily updated than with other hotels...

Room: 5 stars!  Clean clean clean clean clean.  My bf and I absolutely loved our room.  The a\/c worked (o thank goodness), the sheets were clean clean (which meant I didn't even do as thorough of a UV light cleaning like I would normally do :p  ), the furniture was stylish, and the entire floor was non-smoking.  I had previous experiences in other hotels where they didn't segregate the non-smoking from the smoking rooms very well, and I, with my sensitive senses, could not stomach the smell.  So, I was very happy with our room\/floor.  One of the negative things was the bathroom.  You REALLY have to lift up your legs to get into the tub\/shower.  There were more than a few times where I nearly tripped and fell into the tub because I was trying to get into it...  

By the way, the TV channels weren't that great.  Best thing I found on TV was probably PBS.  

No minifridge or microwave, but that's the same with the majority of the hotels on the strip.  We anticipated this and brought our own ice chest and filled it up with the ice from the ice machines on the floor.  It worked great.  =)

Didn't do room service, so can't comment on that.

Walls were fairly thick, as we didn't hear our neighbors.  Doors not as thick.  Then again, drunk patrons are hard to ignore when they're loud in general.

Lots of different foods on the first floor.  Hot dogs, deli sandwiches, ice cream, lots of drinks (it's Vegas), Italian restaurant, and American restaurant.  Probably lots of others I'm missing.

This was the first time the bf and I went to Vegas together, with each of us not having been back in a decade.  So, we were disappointed that the penny slots were not actually penny slots.  All machines accept either cards or dollar bills, but no coins.  So, we didn't really gamble much.  

Go to the America Restaurant.  We had the steak with crab legs dinner.  IT WAS AWESOME.  Steak cooked to the way we wanted it, the crab legs were huge, the baked potato was done right, and the appetizer of buffalo wings hit the spot.  And, the steak\/crab legs was only $15 per meal.  It was seriously one of the best meals we've ever had.  

One negative thing may be when we checked out and really saw all of the charges.  We were expecting the taxes and resort fees and the resort fee taxes, but it still made our hearts sink to see that those fees and taxes by themselves was basically an additional 20 a night on top of the room cost.  Still, it would have been the same in any hotel we stayed at on the strip.  For our 3 night stay, bill came out to around 200 dollars...

Overall, very likely that we'll stay here again.  Compared to other hotels\/casinos on the strip, NYNY was ventilated very well, and the smoke smell didn't really cling onto you.  Staff was courteous and helpful.  And, the room was awesome and better than I thought it would be.",2,1,1

I went a couple times as an adult and remembered why I loved it so much so we started making it a regularly visited place again. Then we go today and they changed everything to a new system where you use a card for everything. I can definitely see the positives to this system but now they have removed several games including my favorite one. Also, we something was wrong with their system and we lost out on several hundred tickets.

This is the worst where I lived in Las Vegas hotel, front desk staff is so mean，he gave us to arrange the most remote corner rooms in the hotel, outside the window is a wall,blocked all of the view and there is no any light come in.That is Wednesday,all the way around the room should be nobody to live, the front desk guy is so mean to gave us this Disgusting room !Remind everybody, when you check-in the hotel,if room number is 383 or 384, do not live, go ask to change other rooms.",2,3,1

The hotel itself is clean and well-attended with a nice variety of eateries, games, bars, and other standard casino fare. Self parking and valet are free. I opted to self park and parked on the roof of the garage and could see my ride from the room. Late checkout gives you an extra hour.

The burger joint, steakhouse, and Italian restaurant are particularly delicious with excellent service and the Irish pub and center bar are fun and lively spots. I didn't ride the roller coaster, but heard it was good enough to not feel ripped off.

The pool is nothing special, though cabanas are available to rent and I had the pleasure of relaxing by one. A flatscreen TV, fridge, outdoor fan, and plenty of lounge furniture made it an enjoyable intermission to the trip.

Visit the spa before booking, if possible. It's not the luxury you might expect from a hotel spa off the strip, but still nice.

Our room was situated in the New Yorker B tower, which overlooks the parking garage, roller coaster, and pool. The windows in this tower (and possibly others, too?) are quite small, allowing very little light into the room during the day. Lighting in the bathroom was also dim and water pressure somewhat weak. Our room had no fridge, but offered a safe and clock radio with iPod dock and a 40"" flatscreen TV. Beds were moderately comfortable and extra pillows were provided. Free WiFi is available in all rooms.

The connecting bridge to Imperial Palace is handy as it leads to the free tram travelling to Mandalay Bay, home to House of Blues. 

Overall, this hotel is fine in terms of cleanliness and convenience. I'd stay here again, but if you're looking for Vegas extravagance where you're immersed in the hotel theme down to the detail, look elsewhere.

Room Tip: Some rooms are quite far from the elevators - if you have mobility limitations or fear the long walk an impossible chore after an evening of drink, request one close by!",0,0,0

I had to come home and get on Yelp to voice my comments on some things at the hotel. First off I will say I like the hotel. The slots I will say don't pay off much but than again what casinos do pay out much. This was the 4 time I stayed here and 2 times when i brought my in-laws with us there rooms (accessable rooms) are always never ready till 5p. Still to this very day I still gripe about the resort fee. 33 bucks a day in addition to my already 97 dollar a night rooms. The one thing that really got me was now they are charging a valet fee of 18 bucks per day. OUCH !! If your a guest of the hotel why isn't it already part of the so called resort fee ?? I think it's just another way of getting more money out of us. Man I paid near 900 bucks for 2 Madison room 3 nights each.. Man I may have to start looking into VROB to get a condo to rent the next time I go to Las Vegas.,0,0,0

At check-in, I was offered a $15 upgrade from the Park Ave to the Madison Ave room. The desk clerk was very sweet and was not a problem at all. However, she did say the Madison Ave rooms were ""renovated.""  I normally wouldn't pay for an upgrade, but I do like new rooms so I confirmed, ""the Madison rooms have been renovated?,"" to which she replied yes. Upon getting to my room, it is quite dated. Beyond that, the furnishings are rather beaten up (dings on all corners and along some edges), chairs are dingy and have a few small stains, I had trouble opening one of the curtains because the rail is apparently damaged, there are many scuffs and what may be patches or smoke stains on the wallpaper, and the bathroom looks 20 years old if a day. I called to ask if there are other rooms in this class more recently renovated, and I was told by a polite agent that when they sold me on a ""renovated"" room, they meant that it is only more recently renovated than the other room I had booked. He initially said ""it's been a couple of years,"" to which I replied that it has CLEARLY been considerably longer than that, then listed some of the signs of age I noted above. Later in the conversation, he said it had been ""about five years or so"" (I doubt that's true, from the look of the room), and told me that the only thing they could offer would be to allow me to downgrade and check into the lower room type. I said I am unwilling to do that without seeing it first, and he said they would reserve a key for me at the desk for one-time entry into the other room. 

I'm an easy traveler. Read any of my other reviews - I don't review often, and when I do it is with little complaint. But this is ridiculous. I was offered an upgrade that I did not ask for, FOR A FEE, and I was told it was ""renovated."" I shouldn't then walk into a room that NEEDS RENOVATED, but happened to have been renovated apparently a decade or more ago. Almost every hotel room in the country more than ten years old would apparently qualify as ""renovated"" by this hotel's standards. If it's ever BEEN renovated, they apparently consider it suitable to say it is renovated for purposes of getting an upgrade fee. The thing is, but for their deceptive practices, it's not that I'm all that unhappy with the room. I've stayed in much better, but I've stayed in worse and I felt I got a good deal when I booked. I would be writing a positive review in a few days, no doubt, had I not been told I was getting something that I am not (for a fee, offered to me without my request for an upgrade). 

At the very least, when I called to inquire initially I feel my upgrade fee should have been refunded and I should not be inconvenienced by having to look at another room to see if it's too crappy for me to stay in. At this point, this hotel should be offering me a TRUE upgrade, free of charge. If that doesn't happen, I will definitely not be staying here, nor will I spend a dime in this casino or at any of its restaurants or events. There is plenty to do in Vegas without NYNY.",4,1,0

Check in and out was quick and easy. When we checked in we left our bags with the bell hop since we arrived before 3:00. At 1:00 our room was ready, and the bell hop brought our bags up quickly. 

The room was nice. We had the Park Avenue room on the 29th floor. It was clean and the bed was pretty comfortable. Not rock hard but not super plush either. I though the decor was simple but nice. It wasn't over the top, but I liked it. It wasn't extremely plain. 

There's a lot to do in the hotel and around the area. The roller coaster is fun but at times can be painful. There's a lot of good food in the New York hotel, too. Although, I will say skip the starbucks. We got a tall coffee, one of the protein boxes, and a small sandwich and it was $17!!! And then they wanted to charge 50 cents for a cup of water. There's other places to get a quick bite in the hotel, but it was very early when we went and it was the only thing open. Just avoid it. 

The only thing I really didn't like about the pool is that it was small. Like really small. Other hotels have multiple pools and they are large! But this one was one tiny bean shaped pool that was only 4.5 feet deep. That part of the hotel could use some improvement, but other than that it's a good place to stay.",1,0,1

With that, this review is specifically about the front desk person and my room.  I didn't utilize any of the many restaurants, food areas, games, etc....

The front desk person was incredibly nice and super understanding when I explained I wasn't there for the ""Vegas"" experience.  I just wanted a quiet (quiet enough) room.  

The room I was in overlooked the roller coaster which was fine.  I heard it and the screams of people for a while.  The alarm clock has a nice sound effect feature.  I turned up the ocean waves to block out the outside noise and all was well.  Otherwise it was a standard room.  It was clean, the bed was comfy and the shower was fine.

Drinks are even worse. I paid $14 for the sorriest bloody mary at Il Fornaio after the bartender said they had good ones. It was served to me in a plastic cup though I wasnt at the pool. Was gambling for hours and only got teo drinks despite being a good tipper.  Went with girlfriend for her birthday and valentines day. Asked if it was possible to upgrade room for these reasons. Got a $200 increase in cost and a view of a brick wall about 5 feet from the window and the roof out the other window. Also, one night the building alarm sounded for about half an hour them finally told us "" everything was ok"".  Overall a lackluster experience. Not sure if I can but will post a pic of the bloody.

The rates were awesome in December and since we planned on venturing off the strip quite a bit, it had great access to the interstate without having to drive on barely any of Las Vegas Blvd. 

We did not gamble at all, so I have nothing to say about the casino, but it seemed much more open and airy than a lot of the other ones we walked through. 

All the staff I encountered were very nice and pleasant. The room we had was very clean and had a nice TV and a great view of the strip and the roller coaster. 

I haven't stayed at any other hotel\/casinos to compare it to, but there was nothing I could really complain about.

I stayed in a suite and it was nice, but it wasn't that nice since it was on the bottom floor! uhh no view except for a piece of railroad track of the roller coaster! Luckily the roller coaster would only operate mid-morning at 11ish and stop running around 7 or 8 so it wasn't a problem. Location wise this hotel is okay, but its more toward the beginning of the strip.  But the whole look of the hotel of Manhattan all bundled up is a must see!",0,0,0
