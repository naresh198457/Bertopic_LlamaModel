I landed in one concourse of the A terminal and flew out of another within the same terminal.  I walked through the first and saw several food options which gave me hope for my options near my departure gate.  Unfortunately after my long walk to the other concourse I found there to be very limited options.  This I cannot understand.  Both concourses had a similar number of gates, yet one was loaded with options and the other completely lacked them.  Of course by the time i walked to my departure gate I did not have time to wander back to the other concourse, so I settled for a lesser option near my gate.

Just hope you do not have to change terminals or rent a car.  Either requires a bus trip.  That is a big pet peeve of mine.  At least you do not have to take a train like in Atlanta or Denver.

The last issue I will cover in this review is the fact that Southwest and US Airways hold most of the spots at this airport.  That is enough reason not to fly here.",0,0,0

On my scale it's a 3.5, but I had to bump it up to a 4 after thinking about all the other horrid airport experiences I've had elsewhere.

Here are my favorite things about Sky Harbor:
-- Traffic to the airport is usually not that bad
-- Free Wifi, which you think would be common, surprisingly is not in most airports, but is fantastic at Sky Harbor
-- Easy to navigate and get through security and where you need to go
-- Clean
-- Typically not crowded and not a bad place to be if you end up there early. I usually sprawl out, and sit and read a book, do some work, catch up on miscellaneous tasks very easily without feeling cramped or some person trying to strike up a conversation with me

Some downsides:
-- It's hard to find an outlet that works depending on what terminal you are at
-- It's nice to have rental cars all in one spot but if you ever need one that place is like a bottleneck and it can take awhile.
-- One time I had to go to the continental cargo facility and it took me 45 minutes to find it",3,0,1

It's a pretty well laid out airport, and making connectors is pretty much a snap because of the super fast people movers that wisp you away to this and that gate area. 

I was there not too long ago and had an early morning 1.5 hour layover. Ate at a typical Tex-Mex place that served chorizo and scrambled eggs. Quite tasty and I like how they mix in plenty of restaurants around the gate areas. 

It's a big and busy airport, but navigating it is very straight forward. If I'm heading out West, this is an airport that I don't mind hanging in if I have to have a layover. It features free wi-fi that seemed to work wherever I went. The airport and it's bathrooms are very clean and well maintained. 

A word to the wise: if you are running a low battery on your electronic devices, you're better off sitting down at a restaurant and trying to find a wall outlet to mooch power from than you are trying to find an available outlet at the gate area. They are few and far between at the gates and you can almost rest assured someone has beaten you to the punch in using it. So I usually go into a restaurant, scope out an outlet near a table or a booth, sit down and use that. Of course, just to be courteous, I'll order something to eat to make it fair. I haven't had to go through the TSA checkpoint since I only land there to connect elsewhere, so I can't comment on that fun experience.",0,0,1

As other Yelpers have stated, for such a large airport the security check goes relatively quickly. Terminal 4 is the biggest\/best with restaurants, shops, etc but the other terminals are fine as well. Make sure if you're getting dropped off\/parking a car that you're at the correct terminal. They're working on a tram but for now you either have a hefty walk or have to catch a shuttle to get to another terminal. Plan ahead, know where you're going and you'll be just fine. Free wi-fi for your layover pleasure and an overall well kept building makes Sky Harbor a great departure point from Phoenix...c'mon, you wouldn't want to be here when it's 115 degrees either.",2,0,3

Sky Harbor used to be my home base for a couple of years. It is a remarkably good airport given the tremendous growth in the Valley of the Sun. 

There are 3 terminals: 
Terminal 2, the smallest and oldest, (United, Continental, others)
Terminal 3, next largest and oldest (Delta, Northwest and many others, including international flights)
Terminal 4, newest and bigger than the others combined, dominated by SouthWest and US AIrways (formerly America West)

For locals, there are the West and East long term parking lots. You can park in the West and walk to Terminal 2; East is much larger with an annex and hi-rise, and closer to terminal 4, but you need to take the shuttles. To help you remember which is east and west, PHX names the shuttles Gecko, RoadRunner, and one other I can't remember! 

For visitors, to get a round the sprawling valley, you need to rent a car. The recently added offsite Rental car Center is huge and well organized into 4 floors with different brands on each floor, and a lot of shuttle buses that are dedicated to each terminal. It is about 1 mile from the airport, but allow 10 minutes for shuttles and loading when you drop off your car. 

They have recently upgraded Terminal 2, expanding the security area and remodeling the restaurant. Terminal 2 has little in the way of food and shops. Terminal 4, organized into 7 separate buildings of gates connected with long hallways and moving sidewalks, has more food and shopping choices, but not on the order of PDX, or DEN. Because of the sheer volume of flights, Term 4 can have a long security check-in line, so plan accordingly. 

If you have questions, there are roaming information assistant volunteers, wearing blue sports coats and hats. Signage is decent and most monitors have been upgraded to flat screens. 

Sky Harbor is located close to Tempe (ASU) and no too far from downtown PHX. The edge of Mesa and Scottsdale are about 5 miles away, but it is 20 or more miles from other parts of North Scottsdale, Deer Valley and North Phoenix. Overall, it is fairly well organized and a clean airport with a lot of flight options, especially on SouthWest or US Airways, who use it as a major hub. For other airlines with a smaller foothold, you have to often connect through LAX, DEN, SLC, ORD or SFO depending on your final destination.",7,1,2

That hurts me to say, I met my wife while we both lived and worked at Grand Canyon, and I've spent a lot of time in mostly northern Arizona.  At one time I dreamed of retiring to a small ranch with lots of big dogs and Mount Humphreys looming in the distance.  No more, those days are long behind me.

The combination of my disgust with Phoenix - really just a hotter, dryer version of LA -  and the unseemly politics of people like Sheriff Joe Arpaio and Governor Brewer have  pretty much taken me to the point where I don't plan to set foot (or spend another dollar) in that state.

This airport blows.  It's huge, if you rented a car it succeeds in outdistancing even Providence in terms of how far you must travel to get your vehicle.  Plan on an extra half hour to take shuttle buses and then hunt for your car due to the extreme lack of effective signage and staff.

And please tell me why the hell I'm paying for your football stadium.  Your team sucks, you have a (ridiculous) corporate sponsor for it,  so why are people who could not care less about the Arizona Cardinals paying a stadium surcharge?

We had a connecting flight at PHX on our trip to San Francisco and our hour-plus layover gave us plenty of time to grab lunch.  We decided on pizza at La Grande Orange in Concourse D.  

There was a security checkpoint at the end of Concourse A and I figured one of the TSA agents could steer us there.  One of them told us that Concourse D was on the other side of the airport so we needed to follow the moving platforms there.

We walked 10 minutes' worth of moving sidewalks--traveling east, south, and then west--before we got to Concourse D.  Then I happened to glance to my right and saw the back of the TSA agent's head.  It was the same lady who had given us directions there.  She was standing in the same spot 10-15 yards away.  

She made it sound like the two concourses were in totally separate parts of the airport when they were literally right across from each other.  Because there's a security checkpoint between the two, you can't just make the 15 second walk from A to D.  Instead you have to take the time wasting A-B-C-D route.

Terminal 4 is larger\/newer and now has the SkyTrain from the economy parking to it, which is surprisingly more convenient than I though, so maybe it's not a complete waste of money. Although, you still need to take shuttles to the rest of the terminals.
The signage is rather clear for the most part, but if you are part of any of the premium boarding groups, sometimes the signs are either not very clear or missing. Seems to have gotten better lately though. Baggage claim area has large screens telling you which carousel has your flight's luggage (foreshadowing for Terminal 2 right here). If you are being picked up by someone, remember that there is both a North and a South side of the arrivals area, so be clear where you are going to be right away, besides just naming the door number.

Terminal 2 should just be a regional airport of its own. It sure got the conveniences of one. The signage for initial security check point is Flight Crews, First class and the rest. Do note, First Class is actually for most Premier flyers and TSA PreCheck as well. Not that anyone can tell you that.
The 4 baggage claims carousels (in theory) show the flight number of where the luggage is coming from, but so far it at best displays late, or more often is announced over the speaker and for most fun occasions, on the wrong carousel altogether. At the very least, there is only one side to the terminal, so you don't have to tell North\/South to your heat stricken friends when they pick you up.

Food\/entertainment choices are nothing exception in either of the terminals and are typical airport food.",1,0,0

I love that SW has outlets now so you can charge your cell phones and knock out some work on your computer 
Quick tip is to pack light, print your boarding pass b4 hand and head straight up to level 3 and go directly to gate. Sunday afternoons\/evening and Monday morning are high traffic tine so I avoid flying on those days as well as weekday early am flight before 9am, anything after 9 is a breeze. 
Utilize east economy parking $8 day vs terminal overnight parking @ $25 day (ouch), Buses run every 10 min, I've never had to wait to long. The Gecko bus which is the west side of the lot has a quicker bus route (avoiding the overflow lots) like the Roadrunner.

I was grateful because I probably would have been walking around aimlessly otherwise. There are plenty of people movers if you dont want to trek it from terminal to terminal. There are a lot of eateries upstairs on the 2nd level. And just like other Yelpers mentioned, they have some popular local fare. 

One thing I noticed that could be improved when I was departing (Southwest) was that there were about 4 gates crammed into one end of the terminal. I was at A8 and there was just a log jam of folks waiting to depart, looking for seats and everything else in between. It was cramped to say the least.

1. Easy TSA process
2. Fabulous restaurants
3. Easy navigation around entire airport including parking outside
4. Extremely efficient pick up\/drop off areas with plenty of space for everyone


To expand on each thing that I really enjoy...

TSA Process:
I frequently travel with just one carry on item and it's generally a process. I'm a frequent flier so I know how to breeze through the lines, if the airport recognizes this and lets me.  By that I mean doesn't stick me in a super long line behind people with a ton of baggage (or kids). (Sorry but it's true!)  Sky Harbor seems to ""get"" this more than other airports and frequently sends me and other people who don't have many items into a smaller, more quickly moving line.  Perhaps I'm totally wrong about this and it's just luck but it's something I've noticed after flying out of PHX dozens fo times.  

Awesome Restaurants:
Normally airports suck at food- they'll try to have options but instead of offering great restaurants they give you shitty options.  (I'm not sure which I'd rather have- no options or shitty options... probably shitty options.) Sky Harbor has a lot of options that are not shitty- not at all!  For example, last year they put in a Matt's Big Breakfast- if you're not from Phx or haven't visited or lived there for a period of time you probably don't know about the gem downtown that is Matt's big breakfast.  It is an awesome breakfast spot with bacon that is almost a half of an inch thick.  YEAH.  There are awesome food places in Sky Harbor and I always try to get there early just to eat.  A funny tidbit.... last year I was flying on Thanksgiving day and ended up having my Thanksgiving dinner at Chelsea's Kitchen outside of the TSA checkpoint at Sky Harbor- haha!

Easy Navigation: 

This one is pretty straightforward so the point I'll focus on here is that they are a stop on the light rail that runs all across the Valley.  I have frequently used this system and have found it foolproof.  Rarely to I trust public transportation when trying to get somewhere with a tight timeframe but I absolutely trust the light rail system with the Sky Harbor drop off points.  

Pick Up\/ Drop Off Areas:

Long story short (I've already written a novel- about an AIRPORT - I'm crazy.) they have really easy pick up drop off areas that are heavily monitored for stalling and it makes it really easy to get space to get in or out of the airport quickly!

This is, by far, the most relaxed airport I've ever been to (to date). We got off the flight and all the nationals breezed through immigration (int'l flight), never seen the lines go that fast.

Free wifi non responsive in C11 or C18 gates (Southwest) nor did paid Boingo Hotspot ( $6.95 for a day) that I purchased in C18 work anywhere else.  When I got back to C18 it wouldn't work.

1:25 plane first moved fromC11 to C18 and 30 minute delay.  Then we are told plane was diverted back to Tucson apparently due to rain (where I had just driven from) and then would return to Sky Harbor at 4:30 But they are not sure....OK....

Then apparently gate was moved to C17 (I found out by asking several people, but not by gate agent or gate sign) departing *perhaps* 5:00 PM but the gate board STILL says 1:35 ON TIME.  I asked gate attendant at C17 if they could fix the gate sign but she says the City of Phoenix has to change the sign -- she has notified them.

So...undoubtedly there are people at the wrong gate, in the wrong line, and even elsewhere in the airport who are going to miss their gate\/flight.

Apparently the adjacent gate's Dallas and Denver flights were also delayed and gates were changed but the gate signs dos not reflect the correct city or correct flight time.

The Phoenix airport flight finder is not accurate about the flight changes either.

Gates at end of Southwest are packed with frustrated people.  Went as far as D concourse in search of decent affordable food and away from bad vibes.  All of them way overpriced and receiving medium to bad reviews only on Yelp.

Then, I had a delay and was switched to a US flight. So, I hopped a bus to take me to the US\/United terminal. This was much much busier. The security line took quite a long time.

The carpet has been updated, and that is the least of the changes the airport has been through since I was flying unattended at the age of 5.  

The majority of the following refers to Terminal 4, as that is where I usually am and where most passengers go through.

Food: If you're willing to pay for a real meal, you can get some decent options here.  La Grande Orange, Blanco, Sauce, Chelsea's Kitchen... all good.  However I do not recommend the on-the-fly kiosks trying to sell you a half-baked breakfast burrito.

Security: On par with other major international airports.  The lines can be long during peak hours, and you have the intrusive machine that scans you as you stand ironically in the pose of a frozen army man.  I've had my pony tail searched.  Remember that the largest airlines share the same terminal, so Terminal 4 is much busier during ""rush hour"".  

Transportation: The rental car agencies are off-site, so you have to use a shuttle if you are renting a car.  Not ideal, but at least there's a simple solution.  The parking garages are the same way, unless you pay for nearby\/covered parking (and you sure will pay).  The new and improved Sky Train will get you around the airport for free, and deposit you at the Phoenix Light Rail station if you choose to use public transportation and avoid all that parking mess.  Driving around the airport is easier than it is in other cities, but it's still ""airport traffic""... be careful.  Watch the signs, or you'll have to do a loop and go at it again.  Within the terminals are some very long hallways with people-movers to get you to your gate without requiring a nap in between.

Shopping: Solid airport selections.  Books, magazines, snacks, etc.  There are some gift-shoppy Arizona-style stores, so if you forgot to pick up a souvenir until now you can go ahead and buy a saguaro sweatshirt or scorpion paperweight.  There are also some of those electronics vending machines where you can buy phones and iPods and such.

Other: As featured in Twilight, beware of the confusing women's restroom.  I haven't been lost in it since I was young, but I guess it's still there.  There is now free WiFi and charging stations at or near each gate.  The whole airport is full of museum-style displays and art exhibits if you want to learn something on your way to retrieve luggage.  

If you call for an airport shuttle, make sure you know what side of the terminal you're on.  Don't answer ""the outside, of course"", I mean North versus South.",2,1,1

Of course, it's always nicer when you fly first class or club member level, as you typically get to avoid major lines.

One in particularly, sounded as if it were written straight from HR...Good organization... LOL.  Anyway, believe all of the horror stories that you hear about airports and TSA. They are more than likely all true.  I'm looking for other options now but if it comes down to just staying put I'd rather do that, personally.  I'll never fly U.S. Airways again. They didn't even give my husband and I seats together. After more research I discovered that this is a trick that they do to pump more money out of couples.  

The days of ""Thank you for flying with us"" or ""Happy travels"" is a thing of the past. We all know why but the scary thing is that there are not any checks and balances In place for the TSA.  They have no fear of being as horrid as they wish. If you give them any offence they threaten with the police who are all but ready to go nuts on anybody. 

However, they were not as bad as the TSA and actually helped us a little.  Since there's a monopoly now with airlines they do not have any need to be pleasant and believe me U.S. Airways is the worst from the obnoxious and loud flight attendant, to the old nasty planes, to the pilot that says on loud speaker, ""Keep it moving one bag on top and one on the bottom you are delaying the plane.""

 We had all just gotten on to board and it's as if the pilot was already blaming us for his enviable lateness.  
Nothing can compare to what TSA did and it's unbelievable. I actually spilled an ICEE  because some woman that jumped out at me and said we're doing extra screening today mam""... You know you'll have to throw that away before you get up there."" She scanned me on my hand and right before I went up to the line I threw it away and missed.  

I apologized to the lady sitting in front that saw me... Suddenly this mean old lady comes out and the girl just says there was a spill. This woman said, ""Who did it"" so harshly that the girl wouldn't rat on me. I honestly think that if she had I would have gone to jail right then and there.  The woman says who did it!!! Like the Soup Nazi and I just said, I don't know but she had on a brown shirt and blue jeans you cannot let her get away with this. LOL.  I swear this TSA woman had a gun on her hip and said, that she couldn't handle it and left.  


Needless to say it was tough right at the get go but it just got worse and worse and yes I had to endure the famous pat down too. The second Soup Nazi was giving me orders and I honestly thought that she wanted me to lift my shirt so I did.  You should have watched this bitch put on a show like I had offended her deepest core of her soul.  I feared that she wouldn't recover from the shock and I'm telling you I'm cute. LOL.  I'm not that hard on the eyes.  She recovered enough to do the pat down as if that $60 million dollar x-ray, (that most likely killed my white blood cells) couldn't get everything on my person. 


The story is longer and crazier and it ended up that we got on the plane and then we were called off of the plane and we just left. The only good thing that I can say is that U.S. Airways did refund our money and so did Expedia.  However, we missed our trip and lost $500.00  for a psychodrama workshop. Oh, one of the TSA agents asked me where I was going. I thought that saying Berkeley, CA would be  a good thing because it's one State over.... How likely am I to highjack a plane that's going two hours away? He grunted back to me...""Berkeley why do you want to go to Berkeley"" as though I had said Death Valley.  Once I answered the psychodrama workshop he had no response because he had no clue what it was. LOL. 

 
I have spoken with a friends of my mother's who was a child in France right before the Nazi's invaded. She said that America has that same eerie feeling right now that she cannot shake. I didn't really get it until Thursday but I agree now. I don't think that it's a color thing... I think that it's a new American Terrorist group called the TSA from Homeland Security and it's them or us.  We are seen as pesky insects that are trying to get them and they have to get us first. It's as if no one said to them look, most of these people are just business or vacation travelers so be pleasant and do your job.  

They definitely need checks and balances and someone there to handle their misconduct. They are completely out of control.  What happened in Afghanistan has nothing to do with this ongoing horror that has been unleashed on the American public. Perhaps, we are just getting ready for what is to become once the Chinese takes over. LOL. 

Oh, and just because U.S. Airways claims that they allow carry-on pets every employee there treated us as if we had a patient with Leprosy with us from the ticket booth through TSA.",0,5,1

Actually, the rental car center is great, state of the art and efficient.  But getting to it is another story entirely.  One has to take a shuttle bus to the rental car center, and I've had it take as long as 15-minutes to get there.  It's incredibly slow, and the rental car center is a long way from the airport.

Ironically, the place where the shuttle buses are repaired and stored is right next to the airport.  How much more sensible it would have been to have the rental car center there, and the repair\/storage facility off-site where the rental car center is now.

And to add insult to injury, one has to exit the highway quite a distance from the rental car center, and go through multiple lights, which back up with rental return traffic.  They have a huge facility charge on rentals, but make it about as difficult as it could be to get to a flight in a reasonable amount of time.

This is the slowest car rental set-up I've seen in the USA.  And it's brand new - what were they thinking?

In fact change is probably the one constant every time I come through Sky Harbor.  I've flown through a bunch of airports in my lifetime so I have a pretty good feel for the things Sky Harbor does well and where there's room for improvement.  In recent years, I do believe the City of Phoenix has made mostly smart decisions with regards to improving the experience here.  Let's do a quick rundown of the good and the bad.

As I write this, Sky Harbor is in a kind of weird state of flux.  For most of my life, the lifeblood of Sky Harbor was Phoenix's own hometime airline.  Originally known as America West Airlines, it later merged with another carrier to become US Airways.  Then almost 2 years ago, Phoenix's hometown airline was bought by American Airlines and the operation shipped to Dallas.  Sky Harbor was no longer anchored by a hometown airline.  And as a result, the number of flights coming in and out of Sky Harbor (and subsequently the amount of foot traffic at the airport) has dropped.  This has meant that Sky Harbor is now in the process of shrinking its footprint while modernizing its operations at the same time.

Terminal 4 (soon to be rebranded as the East Terminal) remains the busiest place at Sky Harbor with Southwest and American airlines making up the bulk of the flight traffic.  British Airways, Air Canada and a number of smaller international airlines also have operations in this terminal.  As other Yelpers have noted, Terminal 4 has seen a big time upgrade in the restaurant offerings available both in the terminal common area as well as the gates.  While there are still big chains like Starbucks and McDonalds around, you'll also find Phoenix based restaurants with locations in this terminal.  You'll find popular valley restaurants like Barrio Cafe, Chelsea's Kitchen, Four Peaks Brewery, Matt's Big Breakfast, Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles, Los Taquitos, Sweet Republic and many many more.

Terminal 3 (soon to be rebranded as the West Terminal) is currently in the middle of 6 year, $600 million renovation and expansion to add more gates, more ticket machines, more luggage carousels, more dining options, and improved technology.  The expansion is being done to make room for the remaining airlines that currently occupy Terminal 2.  Once the last airlines make their move to Terminal 3, Terminal 2 is slated for demolition.  Currently airlines like Delta, Frontier, JetBlue, and Hawaiian make their home at Terminal 3.  Soon airlines like Alaska, United, and a number of smaller regional carriers will move over from Terminal 2 to join them.  Many of the interior improvements are already complete and have greatly improved the look and efficiency of the terminal.  Final completion of the terminal's renovation is slated for 2020.

Another recent addition to Sky Harbor is the SkyTrain system.  This above ground rail system was created to make it easier for people to shuttle between terminals as well as to parking lots and the Valley Metro Light Rail system.  I have to admit this has been something of a disappointment to me.  In my opinion it would've made a whole lot more sense to just run the Valley Metro light rail right through Sky Harbor rather than create an entirely separate system.  Additionally, the boarding areas near the parking garages require you to make a trek down from your parking spot to ground level then right back up about 3 stories to the open air station.  Not only is it logistically weird but that station can be brutally hot in the summertime.  The SkyTrain also currently doesn't connect to any of the west airport parking lots nor does it take you to the rental car section of the airport.  As infrastructure projects go, the SkyTrain system really seems like a botched opportunity.

Overtime, we'll see how things continue to evolve at Sky Harbor.  There's still a great deal of infrastructure improvements that need to be made (faster & more efficient security checks, easier connectivity to power outlets and WiFi, easier navigation to and from the freeways and the terminals, etc.).  For now though, it seems that the City of Phoenix is moving things in a mostly positive direction (improved dining, more transportation options to and from the terminals, consolidating inefficiencies, etc.).  Sky Harbor still has a long way to go before it can ascend to the status of other more beloved airports like Denver, Portland, or Tampa.  But as I said earlier, whether its the people watching, the evolving technology, or the airline industry itself, the one constant at Sky Harbor is change.",5,0,2

This airport has more than one Starbucks location.  The Southwest terminal has a Starbucks right after security so depending on where you are flying out of it is possible to get your coffee fix after going through TSA.

Nevertheless, it gets the job done quite efficiently.

Hit security TSA pre-check; short line and got through really quick, but the scanner agent was pulling almost every bag to check it. What is the point of qualifying for TSA pre-check if every money clip in a backpack and bottle of ice needs to be checked? 

Did you know that you can bring mini bottles of alcohol in your bag and you don't need to remove shoes or liquids in pre-check?  You are also permitted to bring through a bottle of ice, just not liquid - but they will stop you and check the ice. Not the 6 mini bottles of alcohol, just the Contigo bottle of ice.

I did not take my computer off my bag since it does not have a magnetic drive. Computers without magnetic drive are supposed to be fine within bag since they don't affect X-Rays. However, security watcher was overly cautious so he called the police for ""bag check"". Police guys didn't show up for 10 minutes. Then they finally show up and say I simply needed to take the computer out and run it again The security watcher person could tell me to take the computer out which he didn't have to and I wouldn't miss my flight, neither would other people need to wait.

Terminal 4 is expansive and modern, with plenty of amenities and a reasonable walking route to stretch your legs if your layover allows.  But security lineups can be frustratingly long at times.

On the other side of the coin, Terminal 2 is small and offers barely enough in the way of services to satisfy any longer visit than maybe an hour.  Heaven forbid if you're stuck there with kids for an extended period. But security is usually a breeze.

It's centrally located to pretty much everything in the greater Phoenix area and is easily accessible from all main freeways.  There are a few goofy lane transitions if you need to circle the airport drive, but otherwise it's a fairly straightforward in and out for most terminals.  Plus, there's a train to quickly shuttle you between terminals (for if you need to get out of Terminal 2 and over to 4 for some decent food options).

The large, relatively new rental car facility is a quick bus ride from the terminal and is even easier to access, allowing you to avoid navigating the airport altogether.

Bathrooms are pretty clean, signage isnt the easiest to follow when looking for a specific exit area when you are trying to meet up with a shuttle.  When we were dropped off by the shuttle in the morning, I was looking at the signage as you are driving into the airport, a little confusing with the abbreviations and small signage to direct you to the correct terminals for drop off.  Nice landscaping outside of the airport though.  

US Airways agent here was super helpful and totally understood our situation, gave us a hotel voucher, gave us detailed info on what to do, update on our luggage situation, shuttle info, gate info and made sure all our questions were answered.  Which totally is the opposite of what the US Airways agents said over the 800# and at CLT airport customer service agent said.",1,0,0

First and foremost is the worlds most inconvenient and expensive rental car facility. You have to ride an often crowded shuttle for 10-12 minutes, which dumps you into a giant monstrosity to obtain your car- then inconvenient freeway access to get on your way, especially if going to Scottsdale, which at least half the peeps always are. Taxes on cars is nuts. Sometimes you can find cars for as little as $10 a day, only to have the City of Phoenix tack another $20\/day onto it, mostly to pay for more sports stadiums and even more springtime crowds of tourists, along with a light rail that goes to downtown Phoenix, a place where few are brave enough to venture into. One of their bureaucrats got fired for expense account fraud and they sent them packing with a $230,000 per year bonus, for the rest of his life. Corruption, and you will help pay for it. A court ruled some of their tourist taxes illegal, but still amongst the highest in the nation. Not at all welcoming from a facility that promotes itself as ""the world's friendliest airport.""

The next biggest problem with the PHX Airport is Terminal 2. Despite decades of collecting landing fees and passenger facility charges (ticket tax), they haven't invested a dime in the terminal or its infrastructure in 40 years. It's horrible. Carpeting is filthy, security area too small, boarding areas overcrowded, food choices poor. Just went to pick someone up and the only bar in the waiting area  closes at 6pm. On a Wednesday. The cell phone lot for Terminal 2 is absolutely dangerous to enter or exit- involves making an unprotected left turn from behind cactus, across three lanes of all 100% of the airport's traffic speeding out the west end of the field. Returning to Terminal 2 from the cell phone lot is just as hazardous- a blind merge with that same flow of airport traffic approaching your blind spot from behind and to your left at a 45 degree angle, driving nearly a mile, getting over, deciphering poor signage, making a u turn and immediately having to cross the three lanes of 100% of speeding airport traffic arriving from the west entrance so that you have a chance to get over to the lonesome Terminal 2 without causing a wreck. Accidents and lawsuits waiting to happen.

Whatever you do- don't try to change airlines for a connection in PHX, unless its the same airline, American to\/from Southwest, or United to\/from Alaska. PHX airport shut down bus service between the terminals- so if changing airlines to or from Terminals 2 and 4, one has to walk nearly one mile to Terminal 3, then go inside and find the tram to Terminal 4. With luggage, up to 120 degree heat. Elderly or handicapped? Forget it! Better plan to hire a cab. There is no airport in the nation that makes it so inconvenient to change terminals. Alternatively, you could take a rental car bus to the remote rental car facility, change buses and wait for the ride back, an unnecessary 20 to 30 minute ordeal because PHX thought they were being clever shutting down the inter-terminal bus. Irresponsible.

Its obvious that PHX wants you to use Terminal 4, use their ill-conceived and poorly located rental car atrocity, suck up their ridiculous taxes, and stay in risky downtown Phoenix. No thank-you! They need to bulldoze Terminal 2 ASAP, stop building stadiums for wealthy sports franchises, stop overpaying their bureaucrats and cut the tourist tax. Worlds friendliest? I think not.",0,0,0

The airport is very clean, the staff members friendly, there are great food options throughout the airport, and going through security is never a hassle.

Lets face it, no one likes going to the airport, but throughout all of my visits to Sky Harbor I have always had a pleasurable experience. The airport is located very close to downtown and only takes minutes to get to. Since it is so close it is not a hassle for friends to do a quick drop-off or pick-up from the airport. Additionally, a cab fare does not cost very much to get there and if cabs are out of your price range then you can always take the Light Rail to the 44th St. stop. From that stop that Sky Rail takes you straight to your terminal (T5 coming in 2015). I love the location of Sky Harbor and how easy it is to get there.

My favorite part about SH has to be the short wait times at security. Only once have I ever had to wait more than 15 minutes to make it through the entire line. These TSA agents mean business and do their jobs very efficiently. For those with worse luck than me or less patients I would recommend getting TSA Pre-Check approval. This allows you to cut the majority of the line while going through security. Another perk is that you do not have to remove and items from your bag (including laptops, liquids) and you do not have to remove your shoes, belts, or jackets. It is the BEST! If you apply and are approved it is good for 5 years. The app is $85 and you give them permission to do a background cheek and finger printing.

The only reason will not give SH the full five star rating is because I have visited some pretty extravagant airports before in the Middle East that made me realize that most airports in the US are missing a cultural and artistic value. SH does have a number of great artist that have contributed to its design but nothing that was breath taking like I have seen elsewhere.

The rental car shuttle drops you off at the terminal, in my case Terminal 4. It was a little cinfusing where to go from there, since there were signs for Gates A, B, C or D. Combining the SWA app with this airport, it can get challenging since the Southwest app does not list which gate to go to.

Some of the gates have access to electricity but most don't so recharging is done at long tables were there is just not enough plugs to accomondate the hundreds of travels per gate.  I would expect an International Airport of this size to accommodate travelers with plugs right at their seats.  Seats are okay but not great.

It's also easy to drop off\/pick up people with a convenient road that loops around if you missed your passenger.

As most of you know, the weather in AZ is always ideal for flying so I've never encountered severe delays or random flight cancellations.

Terminal 4 is by far the best. American Airlines and Southwest Airlines are both here and my experience with both are phenomenal. I also have access to the Club, which offers snacks, drinks and a beautiful view of the tarmac. The food options are amazing too. From McDonald's to nice restaurants, you can find pretty much anything here!

Terminal 2 is small (where United\/Continental) is. There isn't much there other than the check in counters, gates and baggage claim. A little snack shop but thats' it. Not a terminal you want to spend your time at. 

I've never used Terminal 3 so I can't give a rating there. Overall, great airport, great staff and very efficient operations. Keep up the good work Sky Harbor!",0,0,0

Because of the nice weather, great golf and beautiful resorts, it tends to attract retirees and pleasure seekers which makes it terrible for business travelers. Despite Delta Airlines practically owning Terminal 3, there is no oasis Sky Club here and I would assume that is because even though it is a busy terminal with numerous Delta flights per day, the people that tend to fly in here are not the repeat business travelers that tend to hold Sky Club membership. Also, they have re-designed terminal 3 and even though it is new, glitzy and beautiful, to get from the plane to the ground transportation area is quite a distance. Again, not a big deal if you are coming here for pleasure and have time to gawk at the new glass, marble and lighting along the way but when here for business, it is tough knowing that you have a long way to go just to get out of the airport. Couple that with a rental car center that is at least a 10-12 min ride away plus the time spent waiting to load at the curb and you need to easily build in about 45-60 min after landing before you are actually in some type of transportation and leaving airport property.

Chang Rock n Roll Arizona marathon. Finding that cheap airline ticket from HNL was the challenge in itself, but it was totally worth it. PHX is about a 10 minute drive from downtown Phoenix, so it wasn't too bad, although they also have a public transportation that's pretty noteworthy too. Using Delta Airlines as my prime carrier of choice, I connected through Salt Lake City, before boarding the small regional jet to PHX. There were some direct flights to PHX, but it was on US Airways, an airline I don't know much about, or do I really want to fly with anyways. I stick with what works and makes me happy.

PHX itself is a regional airport, but is large enough to support a large flux of commuters and travelers getting into Phoenix and other destinations within the surrounding region or across the USA, if not farther than that. There is not much in the way of shopping here, unless you were to do the usual snacks, restaurants, and other pickups of souvenirs you want to snag at the airport before leaving for your final destination.  Getting in and out of this airport is similar to other sized airports, just go to follow the directional arrows to the baggage claim and pick up your luggage before heading to the rental car counter or shuttle, taxi cab area, or the waiting area for your friends and family. 

I definitely love PHX and the city of Phoenix and Tempe. Just like most airports, the ticketing area is very much together, unless mentioned otherwise. I do love the airline DIY kiosks, since I know I can do it myself without having to do much of anything. I normally just check in on my iPhone and print out the paper boarding pass at the airport. Sometimes, I should just use my iPhone app to go through security, just to save a little bit of time. Then again, I do like to keep those boarding pass mementos of 1st class seating, just because it's just an awesome feeling to be in 1st class rather than in economy. For now, economy works right now, since airline tickets are getting to be a pain. There is free wifi connectivity here at the airport, so that's a good thing when you need it. 

The baggage claim area at PHX is smaller than I thought, but it's pretty good. The only problem would be that airport prices for food and amenities do cost an arm and a leg. That's the crappy part of the entire flying experience for me. While I know they have to make money somehow, try to find some other way to gauge the flying public, please! I know I shouldn't really grumble about it, but I'm blessed to be flying when all I am doing is running marathons in every state in the United States. I probably won't come back to PHX in the future. If I do, it will just be passing through to other destinations still undiscovered by me.

Even before I lived here in Phoenix I always appreciated it here because once you're past the security checkpoint, EVERYTHING is connected.

The roads in and out of the terminals are great and simple to understand with a cell phone lot on each end which I think is a big deal, makes things simpler. They also just finished the PHX Sky Train (see review) from Metro rail and parking so getting in and out of the airport core is now even simpler. Also has a future extension being built to T3 right now so just in case you do need to switch terminals, this will greatly simplify things for you as well. It really seems like in general they are always trying to improve Sky Harbor and that's what I love about it most. My biggest complaint is that things were becoming run down and old but even that they are changing quickly by remodeling restrooms, laying new carpet, replacing all old signs with new, easier to read, streamlined blue and silver signs. 

Myself I know that I can't wait for friends and family to fly in or me fly out just so I can use this great airport we have here. With all the new improvements there is little not to love here, especially once the Sky Train is complete and serves T3 and the Rental Car Center, all bus shuttles will be eliminated and T2 will eventually be closed and things will be simple, cool, and efficient at Sky Harbor.

Bag check was a game of ""who's on first"" with 3 very clueless women.  

It went something like this:

Sir can you put your bag on the scale so we can weigh it?
(Bf puts bag on scale)

Attendant says: It's 3 lbs over.   

We go to take something out but never do because now it's 1\/2 lb lighter for no apparent reason.

Checker says:  Oh it's only 2.5 lbs - just go through.

Perfect right?

As we bend over to pick up our other bags, another employee comes over and says ""THIS BAG IS OVER""  

??????  we tell her that the other woman said it was ok.

Unfortunately, that woman has mysteriously vanished into thin air - so  we drop all our shit again and start re arranging stuff.

Now  I just need to tell you  some numbers here.  

I KNOW for a fact that when I checked my bag going to Phoenix, it was 1 lb over.  Some of that weight came from stuff that I gave to my bf when I got there and some of the stuff was used while we were vacationing and it's now gone.

My bag was 51 lbs on the way to Phoenix 
Coming back to NYC it weighed 44 lbs

Bf's bag was 52.5 lbs at first weigh on check in back to Newark.

He takes out his toiletries bag - they weigh it - 2.5 lbs - which should bring us down to 50 lbs ....

This should do it  right?

Well, what happens next is astonishing........

We reweigh his bag - now 49 lbs.

THEN ANOTHER FUCKING EMPLOYEE SHOWS UP and the 1st TWO are now Missing.

We put my bag on the scale...... remember, before the toiletries was 44 lbs.

IT NOW READS 52.5 LBS.

I start throwing out the F bomb because OBVIOUSLY the scale is off.  Seriously?  Do the fucking math people.  It's fucking broken.  This is not rocket science.

I'm now forced to open my bag and start rummaging through all my personal stuff in front of everyone.  I take out a few pairs of shoes and put them in my carry on.

Unfortunately, my carry on is a soft bag (le sport sac no padding - no shape) and the heels from the shoes are stabbing my legs with every stride.  By the time we got home, I expected to see bruises all over my legs.

Terminal 2 is the down home, midwestern terminal. It feels much more like a small city airport terminal, where they wheel the jetway\/staircases carefully to the plane's exit doors and blast wind in the faces of travelers as they deboard. Though, they actually do have normal jetways now, that is just what you'd expect by looking at it. T2 is my favorite, in all candor, because lines move faster and bags arrive quicker than at its counterparts.

Terminal 3 means you have a long journey ahead or you've just finished one. In my experience, I have only gone through T3 on cross country or international flights. The escalators are teeming with suits, hurriedly shuffling between flights for what appear to be business meetings or other important matters. Lines move fairly quickly during the day, but early morning or evening hours get backed up faster than you can say ""Nasdaq.""

Lastly, Terminal 4, the mother of all airport terminals. Southwest's hub is here, and budget travelers of all shapes and sizes scamper and jog and saunter to their gates. You will begin to understand how big Phoenix has truly grown to be when you get a good look around terminal four. It is as huge and spread out as the metropolis itself, and ties itself together loosely with its elevators and moving sidewalks. Upon arriving in Phoenix, bags at terminal four take their sweet time to reappear on carousels, so be as patient as time allows.

I've been flying since I was in the womb and I've been to more airports around the country and world than I've been in shopping malls (true story) so when I say this is the BEST airport I've been in, that should carry some weight.

The departure\/arrivals area of each terminal is generally very accessible. Thank you, Phoenix, for not implementing annoying security guards to tell me I can't wait at the curb 2 minutes for my arriving guests when i know theyre on their way out like some airports do (Indianapolis International is horrible about this practice). It makes it much easier when I don't have to circle the airport again.

The concourses allow for a multitude of people which is great. There's really no way to make an airport terminal not claustrophobic because crowds happen but Sky Harbor does a nice job of keeping the flow. The moving sidewalks are great for long treks and I've never waited longer than 10 mins in security lines even the day before Thanksgiving!!!

My only beef is that recently, they've removed more affordable fast food restaurants from the Southwest concourses. I get it: support local restaurants and cafes and be healthier. No seriously, I love me some local Phoenix businesses and I appreciate a good, healthy meal option. But when I have a 5am flight that's about to be a 6 hour hike back to the east coast, I just want a $3 egg biscuit from McDonalds, not a $15 breakfast burrito I could have gotten for $4 at Fili-Bs. But that's really my only complaint because I am a miserly early AM traveler.

Keep doing what you're doing, Sky Harbor. You make flying a more enjoyable experience for this frequent traveler and pick-up\/drop-off extraordinaire.",0,0,0

And yet, despite all of that awesomeness, even I have missed a turn or two here and there and ended up going East instead of West (or vice versa).  

Sure, I drive way too fast for being in an airport, but still... maybe, just maybe, we (i.e. YOU PEOPLE WHO ARE IN CHARGE OF THE AIRPORT SIGNS) could add a few more signs, arrows, etc. to make that stuff a wee bit more clear.  Best case, those slow-driving people figure out where they are going quicker and get the heck out of our way faster.  Worst case, those slow-driving people still drive slow and cause congestion behind them.

I got entirely lost, that's not even the beginning, trying to go from US Airways terminal to the United Terminal, even given wrong directions of where to go, I think.

When you do find the shuttles, I found myself on the WRONG shuttle because they do not go to EVERY terminal, like normal airports, only certain ones go to certain terminals, if it sounds crazy and complicated, its because it is.

Phoenix Sky Harbor is my home airport, so I fly in and out of it on a weekly basis. In comparison to all of the other airports I get to go to, Sky Harbor Terminal 4 ranks pretty high. It is ""newer"", especially the D Gates, compared to a lot of other airports and well maintained. Here are a few things to note:

1. They just recently switched their wifi to Boingo. They still have a complimentary option, so I guess this isn't a big deal. I just cringe whenever I see Boingo hotspots. Maybe because they stole the name of one of my favorite bands from the 80s.

2. Power outlets in the Southwest areas are not too plentiful. They have a few pedestals, some with 6 seats, others with no seats, throughout the terminal. I've always found these to be way too small (impossible for 6 people to sit at once) and awkward. They also have a number of choice comfy seats with outlets. I guess I shouldn't be complaining about free power.

3. The D gates are by far the smallest, so there is often no wait\/very short wait at security. If your flight is going out the C gate, and you have some time but don't like waiting in lines, go through the D gate security checkpoint and walk over. The walk is not that long - Airports are like malls: you know you're going to be doing some walking.

4. I travel with a S'well water bottle so I always have water on the plane. Just don't forget to empty it before you go through security. There are a number of water bottle filling stations throughout the terminal. I usually use the one by the women's restroom at the D gates or the one at the beginning of the A gates.

5. All of the gates in Terminal 4 connect, but not too easily. It is a U-shape, from the A-D. The A gates and D gates do not connect. It's a pretty ice walk, though - if you have the time. And they also have a lot of moving walkways. And guys with carts.  I use an UP band, so I always appreciate the extra steps ;)

Not so much that I love spending a lot of time here, but in the fact that it gets me to where I want to go with less hassle than other places. In fact, in 2009, it ranked 3rd in the nation in on-time arrivals and 11th in on-time departures (out of the 31 major US airports).

I tend to fly through Skyharbor a lot for someone who lives in the Northwest corner of the country. Some of this is due to my strategy of only connecting through warm-weather airports during the winter. This tends to avoid the episodes of being out on the tarmac and having the captain announce: ""We're going to wait here a few minutes because I think we could use a second coat of de-icer."" Or being delayed by freak snowstorms. Or icestorms. I've got a second correlary to this which reads about not connecting through coastal airports during hurricane season, but that's not really relevant for this review...

Anyways, I'm going with four stars since this is the first time I've dealt with the check-in routine at Skyharbor. I have two minor complaints: the first is the actual check-in and the second was security.

As for the check-in, it could just be an airline thing, but I saw this at several counters. They have the echeck-in booths, but were having people with luggage and carry-on both using these things with only a few counter people. What this does is make everyone wait while the (overworked) counter person tries to run around and check everyones' luggage in. I guess I'm used to having separate lines for those of us with carry-on only. Waiting in line behind the guys and girls with eight suitcases sort of defeats the purpose of travelling light (at least in this sense).

The second complaint is security. Hardly a new complaint, but it seems a bit tighter here than at most other airports I've been through. In the x-ray line, the person working the machine was very slow and was calling for a bag check on every other person. I considered even jumping into another line to see if it improved, but figured that might be considered suspicious behavoir and get pulled out for some sort of horrific interrogation (*light shining in my face as a person in the shadows asks questions* ""Doug C., I couldn't help but notice that you had a receipt from Taco Bell in your luggage."" *slams fists on counter* ""ARE YOU A MEXICAN SPY? DO YOU WORK FOR THE FEDERALES?"")

As it turns out, staying in line didn't really work much better. Despite not setting off the alarm on the walk through, I got pulled aside for a pat-down. (And, yes, I have been working out. Thanks for noticing buddy.) Then the x-ray watcher stopped my bags to have them inspect the fluids that were clearly dangerous*. But after listening to a lecture and promising to floss three times a day, I was finally allowed to leave and exit for my flight.

I only have one experience with this, but I guess I could sum it up with: nice airport, but arrive early.

They have many different non generic franchise food options inside and outside of the gates . My favorite coffee shop ""The Cartel Coffee Lab"" is a totally winner and many of the Phoenix restaurants have airport version as well. 

The airport is very easy to navigate and in my experiences the TSA has been pretty friendly down to earth people that don't act like they hate their life \/ most airport TSA workers. Super clean with moving walkways and lots of shopping areas. 

I have experienced some pretty cool promotional groups asking for peoples opinions and a Facebook Virtual Reality demo before you go to security. They also have an art and cultural museum that I wish they had at every airport. It is great to learn about the state and city you are visiting and this airport does a really cool job of it. You sometimes find it on the walls around the airport, but I enjoy how this airport does it as well as the wall artwork.  They also use nice accents to nightlight the outside structure and the gates which give you that Desert Santa Fe feeling. So.... my only gripe about this place is the bleeping rental center. I have no clue who thoguht it would be a good idea to build it 6 miles down the road from the airport.

I hadn't been through PHX in some time but my last visit was via the Southwest concourse.

The Club at PHX, a lounge, that I have member access to, is only open until 3:30 PM. Really? Planes do depart after 3:30 PM. After 3:30 it becomes the British Airways lounge and only BA passengers may access the lounge. TSA PreCheck was closed on this particular day which didn't improve my mood.

Why is it the worst you ask?
- the shuttles from the terminal to the RCC and from the RCC to the terminals wait until they are mostly full to leave which means you could be sitting on the shuttle for 15 minutes before it even gets moving. Other airports have no problem keeping their shuttles in the move.

- there are a lot early flights out of PHX (like get to the airport no later than 4am flights) and there are hardly any staff around at that time so everything us slower than usual. The last thing I want to do is get up even earlier to deal with that...

- the garages are massive and not well signed... You keep driving and driving in it trying to leave or return your car thinking, did I miss it? Until 8 minutes later you see a sign with tiny lettering pointing you in the next direction.

For those of you who say that the airport is in need of some new carpet: I agree. Those of you who think the layout is stupid: you are wrong. Airports aren't supposed to be a work of art. If you were to know a single thing about architecture, airport planning, and industrial design, you would realize that the way the airport is laid out is really efficient. You can quickly get to your terminal, and the E shape is so that airplanes can park on either side of the extending structures. Pre security is pretty nice.
For those of you who gave the airport itself a bad review because of an experience that you had with an airline, your review belongs on that airline's respective page. It is really misguiding when you rate an airport poorly because of a bad experience with an airline. You are supposed to rate and review the airport itself.

Wir hatten kürzlich zweimal das ""Vergnügen"", diesen Airport zu erleben: bei der An- und bei der Abreise unseres Urlaubes. Ich fliege gern, und ich schätze viele gute Flughäfen. Phoenix gehört nicht unbedingt dazu.

Phoenix Airport ist wie so einige amerikanische Flughäfen gigantisch groß. Und liegt dennoch sehr zentral in Phoenix. Die Wege ziehen sich hin und hin und hin. Vom Ankunftsgate bis zur Immigration gingen wir gefühlte Meilen.

Die Immigration-Prozedere war ok, wenn auch ein wenig lahm. Das haben wir schon weitaus besser erlebt. Die Koffer waren auch da und nach einigem Suchen fanden wir auch Trolleys. Dann hieß es, Transport zu unserem Hotel finden. Es gibt hier diverse Ausgänge, alle gut beschildert, aber sehr viele mit Taxi- und Shuttlehinweisen, so dass wir rumrätselten, welcher denn nun der richtige sei. Draußen angekommen ein Gewusel an Bussen und Taxis. Aber keinerlei klare Infos, wo was wie läuft. Shuttle zu unserem Hotel fanden wir nicht, passendes Taxi nur mit Hilfe eines Taxieinweisers.

Beim Abflug standen wir mit unserem Gepäck an einem der vielen Eingänge vom Terminal 4 und suchten verzweifelt Trolleys für unsere Koffer (immerhin für 6 Personen). Nichts da, weit und breit nicht zu finden. Nachfrage ergab, dass es diese in der Ankunftsebene gäbe - auf die Idee muss man als Abreisender erst mal kommen. Aber auch da waren irgendwie alle weg. Lösung fand sich dann über einen Kofferträger mit großer Karre, der die Koffer zum Abfertigungsschalter transportierte. Und wir waren bereits mit ersten Schwitzflecken gekennzeichnet. Bezahlung erfolgte übrigens: Pls pay what you mean I deserve"" - tja, da eiert man rum, wieviele bucks man zücken soll.

Der Terminal sauber und übersichtlich (und wieder irre lange Wege). Da unser Flug Verspätung hatte, hieß es mehr als drei Stunden zu überbrücken. Überraschend wurden wir von einem Herrn im roten Jacket angesprochen: Ehrenamtliche Helfer, die wartenden Paxen Informationen geben, wie man am besten die Zeit verbringen kann: Museum im Airport besuchen, mit der Schnellbahn mal kurz nach Downtown fahren, wo es was zu essen gibt etc. Tolle Sache - sehr amerikanisch.

One story which I will share (more for my own personal note taking) was that while I waited to check my luggage I observed a man openly berating his wife while they traveled with their four children. That dude was not cool and if I had my way, he would have been flying on the outside of the plane to his next destination.

They look like they are trying to revamp the airport--for over a year -- but nothing has changed since the last time I was here. Heck of a contractor - like to see how they pulled the contract over Skyharbor's already blind eyes. Just milking these guys. 
Big low score for TSA. Lines like Newark. The best part: they have TSA precheck - in fact, you can sign up for this premium service at the airport. They will take you information, your money ..... O yeah, just informed by the TSA agents that there is no such thing as TSA precheck in Phoenix.  Yup. They got the signs, they got the guy just took your money - but there is no precheck line. As a result - the lines just build and build.
Returning a rental car is the worst. The rental agency is located far off the airport campus - I think it is near an oasis of some sort. But no matter, it will take you an extremely long time to return the car due to poor signage (especially if traveling from Tuscon), then you have to wait for the bus, then get the grand surprise of waiting in line for TSA....followed by the sight of non-existent construction.

Above was my check in tip.  Below is what Lacey H. sent me.  She is a TSA agent in the airport.  When you read all the reviews on the airport, seems my opinion of the TSA organization is an opinion shared by many.  Having Lacey H. say what she did makes it even more apparent at the lack of professionalism in the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.  

This is not a slam against the TSA in total, as they do a terrific job in many many airports.  This is specifically a leadership issue in Phoenix. 

Thanks Lacey for supporting my review!

For your tip at: Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport

For the most part, Sky Harbor airport isn't anything particularly special. However, when comparing it with other US airports, I do find certain things to be much more convenient. First of all, getting around is simple. The terminals are much closer together and with the help of a series of moving walkways, it's easy to get around from one to the other without huffing and puffing along the way. Checking-in is also fairly simple with the ""stacked"" design of this airport. You get dropped off, walk into where the ticket counters are, then head up the elevator or escalator to where the terminals are. For me (with checking luggage at a self-service kiosk), I can get there, checked-in, and through security in under 30 minutes...even on a busy day. Dining options are average, but free wi-fi and plenty of outlets make for a comfortable wait. Just make sure to look up your terminal and gate beforehand to avoid having to go from one end of the airport to the other; once you've got that down, this place will seem much smaller.",3,3,3

So on my connecting flight home, i once again landed at Sky Harbor. 
I had a great weekend, i was exhausted, and i suppose I didn't have much energy to hate on everything.

Second look at Sky Harbor, it's not so bad.  I suppose i wasn't in such a grumpy mood for having to stay here for 5 hours again.  Although I do still hold up to my previous statement that seating is a bit limited and that there aren't many food choices...but an airport is an airport right?  

Unfortunately, I didn't get an opportunity to check out the Art Museum suggested by a fellow yelper (yes, they have an art museum!) but I was just glad to be on my way home. 

And this airport is HUGE. I was lucky enough to have landed in A second time around because my connector was in A, but last thursday, i landed in B and trekked all the way to A to reach my connector. It was quite a walk.",1,2,2

Also, each terminal letter (A,B, C,) has two actual terminal arms associated with it so you actually will be going past two terminals for every letter you are away. The D terminal is only one arm. 

Today, I arrived at the C gate at 6:20 because of a 20 minute delay in LA. My connecting flight was boarding at 6:10. So much for Early Bird Check In. There wasn't a whole lot of time to begin with. I would have landed at 6 pm and boarded at 6:10. 

I ran the distance to get to the gate and was literally THE LAST person to board.

- The fact that the Phoenix Airport logo is the same as the Rebel alliance from Star Wars... at least it did when a sleepy eyed Scotch-Irishman stumbled off of a place after just waking up.
- A Starbucks located in what seemed like every terminal and the main hub. A smart marketing strategy.

My son had an unexpected flight delay of 2+hours so I got him a grilled cheese sandwich at Paradise Bakery.....it was pitifully small. I was woefully unhappy to learn that we paid $10 for a sandwich, cookie and a drink. The sandwich was the size of two business cards.

2. To be such a busy hub, I think we need more folks with the motorized carts

3. We are in the digital age...can we have more places to plug in and charge up? This issue becomes really obvious when flights are delayed...

4. What needs to be done to have faster wi-fi? I mean really, what needs to be done? This also painfully obvious when the airport is packed and there are 1000's of us logged on trying to connect with folks through our devices.

This place has come a long way...and yet still has some ways to go. But I can absolutely see HUGE improvements.",4,2,4

That makes this airport...Tricky. 
First off there are 4 terminals that I am aware of and its not even easy to move gates within the terminals.  It makes a huge airport feel a little smaller, but it makes dining and pick up or drop off much harder.  Last, but most certainly not least - most plug ins are hidden at gates in the floor and if there is a rhyme or reason as to where they are.... you need a de-coder to figure it out.

There are all sorts of things to see and buy. Everything is expensive, probably because it was brought in on one of the flying machines.

When you get outside the building, there are other machines to take you to a special place to rent a smaller machine, where they will attempt to sell you hundreds of dollars of insurance that you don't need, right, Dollar Rent a Car, you bastards?

I landed at 7:45pm and there was nary a sole in sight. It wasn't much different when I left at 11am a few days later.

That being said, I didn't mind being here (not that I had a real choice). The central hub of terminal 3 has a few shops to pick-up a last souvenir trinket and eateries outside the security but the real highlight is the airplane and multistory red canyon wall that surround the escalators. It was actually stunning to admire. Beyond security there's little in the concourse and both times I ended up at a vending machine to quench my thirst. There's also precious few outlets - so avoid being here with a low cell phone battery.

The staff I encountered however was exceptionally friendly. Frankly I think they were stunned someone was willingly coming to Phoenix on vacation during the hottest month of the year. Whatever the reason, everyone from the security personnel to the nice lady who called my hotel so the shuttle van could come and fetch me was very nice to interact with and great ambassadors for their city.

Rental cars are served up from their own service center, so no waiting for the van for your particular provider to show up. Just hop on the van and tell the driver which company and you'll be dropped off at the appropriate door with directions of where to go from there. The rental car center is about 15 minutes from the airport itself - so make sure you plan ahead. Also, there's few gas stations near the airport and rental car center.

The layout is odd in that you have to walk through a long area of nothingness to get from the Terminal 3 gates to the baggage area, and then again to get to the rental car shuttle bus. So plan for quite a bit of extra time from landing to getting to your rental car.

Returning the rental car was easy as you just drive to the rental car facility and find the correct lane for the company you rented from.

1) You can fly non-stop to most major domestic destinations, and even some international ones (mostly Mexico and Canada, but hey, London is on the list too!).

2) You can take the light rail to the airport and save money on parking. Even if you pay to park, the economy lot is only $8\/day and comes with the fun of riding the new sky tram.

3) Yes, it's a big airport, but the moving sidewalks in Terminal 4 help you get around quickly. If for some reason you need to go to another terminal, there is an inter-terminal bus to take you, and eventually the sky tram will be able to do that too.

4) I have been through security tons of times--my first job was working at Starbucks in the C-gates of Terminal 4, so I had to go through security every day. Even when the line looks long, it generally moves pretty quickly.

5) Finally, the food in Terminal 4 is amazing! Sadly the other terminals kind of stink when it comes to dining options, but thankfully most airlines fly out of T4. There are tons of amazing local Phoenix restaurants represented, with a few chains thrown in the mix. The best part is most of the local places don't have the typical crazy mark-up that airports are known for.

Airports in general suck - they always have. Since you-know-when, they've definitely kicked up the suck to a spectacular degree. I mean, I look back to pre-you-know-when days of flying as the good-old-days. I wish you could still meet people at the gates without a ticket. Hell, I wish you could get in the fucking airport without having to remove your shoes. 

Honestly, I'm willing to risk the occasional plane hijack in exchange for being able to not feel personally violated just because I wanna travel. It seriously factors in to my decisions to travel - the flying... more specifically, the airport. If someone really wanted to - they could still easily take over a flight or kill people on a plane or even crash it into a building. It's probably easier to take over a plane today than it is to hijack a taxi cab or a bus or break into someone's house. And yet we agree to surrender our 4 ounces of shampoo and nail clippers - like I can fucking attack someone with nail clippers. Fuck you.

Sky Harbor is like any other airport. They have some decent bars and it can make for some interesting people watching. As many times as I've been to this airport to pick up or drop off, I still have anxiety about navigating around it - it's not that bad, but it still sucks. I'll say it's just slightly less obnoxious than waiting in line for Mr. Toad's Wild Ride at Disneyland. 

One time I was picking someone up - had them on the cell phone. They had their suitcase and were ready to meet me outside - I asked which side they wanted to meet me on and they said South, so I pulled up to the curb to wait for them to walk right out. It wasn't busy at all either, mind you. I was there for not even two seconds when some old fuck tells me to keep moving. I pointed to the door and said the person was coming out and he yelled at me to move along and drive around. He even put his hands on my car to tell me again - I said ""fuck, fine... "" and pulled forward. He comes to my door and says I tried to run him over and starts taking my license plate. What?! I wish I had run him over. 

Anyway - this airport is just as annoying as all airports are... unless you know of one where they don't give you a cavity search when you want to go to Hawaii. I am honestly not worried at all about terrorists. I feel no safer and no less safe now than I did in 2000. I would feel just as safe if they let us bring samurai swords and shotguns on board. I can rest just fine knowing the guy next to me might have 4 ounces of hair gel rather than 3. I'm more worried about what kinds of lice and shit live inside the pillows and blankets on the planes (they rarely clean them just so you know - only when the plane is serviced if at all).

You don't need to xray my bag or boot up my laptop. I'm not hiding a switchblade or a bomb in my shoe. I don't care if anyone else is. If I die, I die. That's the risk I take. It's a miracle enough the fucking things stay in the sky considering Airlines let these things fly when they're held together by duct tape. I've tried to duct tape a pair of shoes and they didn't even last for 2 hours of light walking.

Hey, the events of you-know-when were tragic... whether you believe it was an inside job or a straight up act of anti-American hate-fueled terrorism, I think we've suffered enough already. I say we lighten up on it. More people have probably died from second hand smoke they inhaled while on routine red-eye business class flights than have ever died from hijackings.",7,12,6

My bag. It was up in the air somewhere after they checked it in at the gate, said there weren't any more spaces in the overhead bin. Of course, when I get to my seat, there's a vacuum of space, and the flight attendant didn't check to see when my flight was landing in Cabo. I had a four hour lay-over.

This gave me plenty of time to wander around Phoenix Sky Harbor. This airport is massive. Shaped like a giant rectangle with four gates connected by long corridors and automatic walkways, it's kind of amazing how much space there is. But take a peek outside the expanse of windows, through the sweltering 110+ degree midday glare you can see why--there's simply not a lot of stuff in Phoenix but desert, a few buildings, and a range of mountains.

The food here isn't much to write home about, a lot of repeat offenders like Starbucks, Burger King, Cinnabon, and a few local eateries. There's also a few really sad California Pizza Kitchen ASAP kiosks here that are so small they don't even serve pizza, they've got just enough room for a fridge packed with salad. Strange.

So I'm wandering around the baggage claim area, hoping they didn't lose my luggage. I look at my ticket my baggage re-routing order, ""Grey with green and white plat."" WTF.

This airport has four terminals, so depending on which airline you use, you could have a fab experience or a completely drab one. I checked in about an hour too early so I was able to explore a little bit between terminals. Terminal three is like a mix between a mall food court and a ghost town. There's a sbarro and a few security check points and some gift shops. Once you get through the checkpoint you walk through the gate area where nothing is open and there is a drink vending machine. All the restaurants are closed during the day and evening and the gift shops seem like they haven't been open in months. If you take the shuttle out to terminal four, its like you are at a completely different airport. 

Terminal four is more modern, new, and filled with restaurants made popular in Phoenix. There's a Lo-Lo;'s Chicken and Waffles there so if you missed the opportunity to stop at the actual restaurant in the city, definitely grab something here. There are also some cool shops and more people in this terminal. It's very clean and there are a lot of security and general staff personnel available to direct you. 

There is a shuttle that stops every few minutes at the terminals so if you have the time, take the shuttle to explore the various locations at the airport. It's a great time killer if you are super early for your flight or have a long layover.

At every other airport I travel through in the country, the  PRE-CHECK passengers get a special lane and they zip right through - from boarding pass screening to baggage and body scans.

At the Phoenix Sky Harbor Terminal D, security check point, the  PRE-CHECK passengers go through a special boarding pass lane.
They are told to leave their shoes & belt on, computers in their bag, etc. AND TO HAVE THEIR ID AND BOARDING PASS OUT.

Since they are merging back in with the regular ""strip to your shorts"" crowd, the TSA personnel get confused as to who is  PRE-CHECK and who isn't.

When I got to the x-ray scanner I was told to empty my pockets, remove my belt and take off my shoes. I told the TSA guy that I was a  PRE-CHECK passenger. he got rude and said that I was supposed to go through the metal detector instead. SOMEONE IS NOT DOING THEIR JOB !

Then, once my bag came through another TSA clown got mad at me for not removing my computer from my bag. Again, I explained that I was one of the  PRE-CHECK passengers. He said, ""no one told me."" AGAIN, SOMEONE IS NOT DOING THEIR JOB.

I saw this confusion with the merger & separation of the  PRE-CHECK passengers anger the passengers and confuse the TSA employees. They need to run a separate lane, or have the  PRE-CHECK passengers wear a silly hat or hold a plastic card identifying them as SPECIAL. TSA is yelling at passengers who are following their directions as  PRE-CHECK passengers, when TSA employees think that they are normal ""strip naked"" passengers.

Your experience will really depend on which terminal you fly out of - which most of my adult life has been terminal 4.  But I remember as a kid, Terminal 2 was pretty cosmopolitan and the short term parking was just across the street.  

Terminal 4 is lacking in the food\/amenities department, but they are working on it.  The best experience is on the concourse, before the security gates.  But if you didn't know and headed to your gate, you still have a few options, but you can't be picky.  

My favorite is Blue Burrito - located near A26 side of the terminal. And there are plenty are Sbux around, however, pay attention to your bill.  I've been overcharged before.

On my last visit, terminal 4 is getting a Modern Burger and Blanco Y Tequila spot...which is super cool.  They are both owned by the Fox chain of restaurants, so they are nothing uber unique, but he does have a knack for coming up with cool concepts to lure you in.  And spend your money.

There are plenty of gates, food options, and adequate staffing to provide complimentary shuttle rides just from one side of the airport to another, INSIDE the building. It's the nice touches that make this airport a place to enjoy venturing through to get on and off flights.

On the note of food: If you go through some of the Yelp reviews, you'll find some reviewers commenting on how great the selection of shops are after going through TSA security checkpoints... But then on other reviews, you read the converse, that there are actually few shops after going through security. This is because of how the gate system is fundamentally set up at Sky Harbor.

According to Sky Harbor's official website as of February 2017:
- Gates 3 and 4 at the time that this review was written house your major airliners: Delta, Frontier, Hawaiian, JetBlue, Air Canada, American Airlines, British Airways, Southwest Airlines, Volaris, WestJet 
- Gate 2 house Alaska Airlines, Boutique Air, Great Lakes Airlines, Spirit Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, United Airlines.
- Gate 1 info couldn't be found; at least I couldn't.

""But Russell, those two bullet points each have major airlines in them!""

... Do they? Spirit Airlines may be cheap, but does that mean they are good? Just Google them, the user experience reviews are not good at all. 

Anyway, I've flown on airlines that have been in gates 2, 3 and 4. The ""gate 3\/4"" group has much more popularity and food shops after you pass through security.

Gate 2 on the other hand has only a handful and it's spanned ironically a long hallway. 

So if you're flying an airline that docks in gate 2, just bear in mind that you are not going to have many selections to choose from. I think the two most useful vendors that I found were Paradise Bakery and Cafe, and the Peets Coffee shop, both of which are packed because again, limited vendor selections.

Meanwhile, when you go through the gate 3\/4 group, you get access to stuff like gourmet restaurants, burger eateries, a Starbucks, and even a few bars. 

This disparity I really do not give a fuck about, but for Yelpers sake, there you have it for reference.

Now, on to other things that I've found to be important as a flyer:

1. Bathrooms are clean.
2. There is public wifi but it's really shitty like every airport's wifi.
3. Parking in the garage right next to the terminals is kinda pricey, $25 a day. So if you're gone for a week, you're spending over $100 just for parking. Recommend a ride-sharing service like Lyft or Uber. 
4. Highway access to the airport is limited so book your flights for early in the day or late in the evening.
5. If traveling during the hot months of Phoenix, don't park your car in the parking lots not next to the terminals because they're all uncovered. Uncovered lots in Phoenix will open up MASSIVE sun damage to your car because Phoenix Sun is basically a fuck you to automobiles.",2,1,1

With a 2 hour layover there's not much to eat here in terms of good restaurants. There's a sports bar, couple sandwich places, CPK, and a burrito bar. The layout of terminal 4 is frustrating. To get from one side to the other without going back through security, you would have to take 6 walking escalators to get to the other shops and gates. Eg. Going form US Airways to Southwest Gates.

The whole airports needs an overhaul. With the brown looking carpets, and with the shops that are already closed for construction, it really does not feel modern.

It is a very busy airport, indeed...but it is efficient, nonetheless. Also, before reading, keep in mind that TSA, across the board, is always a crapshoot of crapiness. I leave them out of my reviews, because we all know how ""lovely"" they are.

~The Good~
Sky Harbor is one of the busiest airports in the world, and they are very efficient. I have never waited on the tarmac to take off, in my 27 years of flying out of the place. As air trends have evolved, so has Sky Harbor. We as a society locally have trended to hip and fun food joints, so what did Sky Harbor do? They brough in local popular  merchants like LGO and gave them their own stores in terminals. SCORE! I hate feeling like I am trapped in a cookie cutter food joint, so being able to attend an airport, and STILL eat local, that is full of win. Another nice thing is that Sky Harbor has volunteers that roam the terminals to guide aimless travelers. I have never used them, but they are always gracious and kind, and seem ready to help. 

Being a big airport, you would think its a mess getting through the TSA. But since weather isn't a big issue, we can always count on arriving at a set time prior to flight to get ready for pre-boarding. I am a planner, so knowing I do not have to plan random variables is a big plus. The airport is right in the middle of all the action, and is 15 minutes away from most cities in Phoenix Metro. How much else can I say? They really did it right when they built this airport...and they continue to provide great service.

~The Bad~
I have no real complaints...The parking rates are goofy, but that's the same way it is at most airports...If you are parking and leaving your car for an extended period of time, there are vendors who can provide much cheaper options, so problemo solved! I think my only beef is with some of the expansions they have done, which seem  to not really have helped much. The people-mover they built seems to try to make us more of a tech-savvy or next-generation airport, but we aren't an inner-city kind of town, so the mover was, in my mind, a big waste of money. Oh well. Nice airport, just wish they would put money in the right spots.

~The Down Low~

Major Airline Carriers:
American Airlines, Southwest, Delta, United, and JetBlue. Alaska, Spirit, and Frontier just to name a few.

Parking:
Whether you're parking by the East Economy or 44th Street Station, you can take a quick 10 minute ride to your terminal on the Sky Train in operation. A beautiful scenic view of the AZ mountains as you hold your luggage close by, and you'll be at Terminal 4 before the blink of an eye.

Security:
The security checkpoints here are generally pretty slow and dragged out like a sappy teen romance movie, the TSA is pretty understaffed here but with Pre-Check it's rather groovy. The Pre-check lanes are still inconsistent and not always open, so if you're runnin late for your flight better be praying and hopin'. Depending on the time of your flight it could be congested or desolate, so take your shoes and belts off quickly to get through because ""quick"" is not definite.

Baggage Claim:
Checking in your bag can be a hassle which is why you should pack light, because you would expect your things to be brought out within 30 minutes of deplaning your flight. It's not always so convenient and sometimes they move your bags around, during rush hour expect 4 flights to use the same carousel as a battleground.

Restaurants:
This is an ""airport"" we're talking here so don't expect Starbucks (B20) at every gate, but Sky Harbor offers many local\/national favorites if you're hungry and willing to wait. They offer a vast selection of bites ranging from pizza to sandwiches and Wendy's\/McDonald's fast food, and Blanco Tacos & Tequila (by A5) is for you if you're a burrito dude (carnitas so good!)

Wifi:
The wifi here is surprisingly trustworthy so if you're in need for work or just feeling social network dehydration, know that I've been able to watch my online classes on the wifi here on various occasions.

Conclusion:
Phoenix Sky Harbor is a new and modern airport with renovations always underway, they keep updating the flooring and trains but sometimes have understaffed TSA. If you're here on a layover the wifi is reliable and a variety of food can be found, so next time know you have something to look forward to if you're PHX bound!

So we land and they announce that all connecting flights will have to change planes blah blah!  Ok, no problem ... then all of a sudden WTF?!!!  Our connecting flight we have to WUT??!!  This is what we were told verbatim:

""You have to leave the main airport, wait outside for a skyharbor bus, which will then take you to Terminal 2, re-check in at the counter and go through security.  Have a Happy Holiday!""  

So we have less than an hour to make our connecting flight - we run outside (thank gawd we didn't have too many carry-ons), cross the street, wait wait for OOH there's a bus - crap we missed it --- ooh another one we get on and goodness gracious --- Terminal 2 is HALF WAY TO BFE!!  We jump off and woah, are we back in Kansas ToTo? As a previous yelper stated, Term 2 is an Abysmal Place (she describes it to a T).  After having to got through the hassle of re-checking in and going through their horrid security line (that could be another review in itself) ... we make it to our gate as they are boarding with 15 min to spare & hear my hubby vent!

Avoid United Express flights if they have a connecting flight here! YUCK!",6,0,1

I have been using Uber for all my transportation needs when in Phoenix, but my last trip required me to have a rental car.  It took a good 20-25mins for the shuttle to get me from the terminal to the rental car center and although there is a beautiful new state of the art rental center housing all the rental car companies, I found the transportation time needed to get your car extremely time consuming due to it's distance from the terminal.  When departing, I had to allocate a lot of extra time to sufficiently return my car and get to the terminal without missing my flight.

I was smart and only brought a carry-on bag and was ready to jet as soon as the airplane doors opened as I only had 20 minutes to catch my connecting flight due to some unexpected maintenance in Puerto Vallarta.  I walked very briskly from one of the last B gates hoping in the back of my mind there was not a long line in customs and that I wouldn't have to go through the TSA again to get to my connect terminal. 

First roadblock, customs, alas had minimal lines but I was a little confused by the self checkout passport scanner devices. It did seem to help decrease the lines though. I sauntered through the customs\/immigration counter and continued my hustle toward the A gates. I know there is some method to the madness but I think it's kind of silly how you can come out of the international arrival gates go out through customs and have to basically circle back around if you're trying to get to the A gates. Anyway, still going at warp 9 speed I picked up my bag and ran up the steps to the shops area and found a departure board hoping my gate was near. Realizing it was the A gate and there wasn't any signage stating were A was I hollered at one of the people at the customer service desk who pointed me in the right direction. Visually sweating at this point as it was like 90 degrees in the terminal as opposed to the 110 or more outside and with a jacket on mind you, since the plane was a little brisk I got to the A gate. 

""Hay dios mio!"", I exclaimed still reeling from my trip to Mexico as I came to roadblock #2, TSA. With no time to waste, I started to disrobe. We all know the drill, coats, shoes, belts, laptops out of laptops, liquids in clear bag outside of your carryon and etc. I threw my coat and shoes and liquids in one tote and put my carryon on the conveyor. I stepped into the body scanner and grabbed my stuff off the belt. Forget about putting yourself back together! I slid into my shoes and wobbled my way onward until the back of my shoes slipped over the back of my heels. 

I see A8 in the distance and the crowd of travelers weaving in and out with several people frozen in confusion as they are unsure where they are or where they should be. Warp 10 kicks in and soon I pass A3, then 4 then 7. There is no one left in the A8 waiting area. The emotions start to override hope. I see a man walking by with an ipad that works for the airport. I ask, ""how do I get on this plane? The one that is sitting in the gate."" He mumbles some things that show he's confused as to what I'm asking. He checks the ipad and again mumbles information that doesn't help answer my question. Then like a ray of sunshine a woman appears from behind the secure gate door. She asks, ""are you coming from Puerto Vallarta? how many more are there? where they close to you?"" I mutter while trying to catch my breath, ""Yes, there are like 5-7 more but I think they're stuck in the TSA area."" She said ""the captain knows y'all had some maintenance issues and wanted to try to wait, but I don't think we can wait for anyone else. We had already released y'alls seats."" She keyed me back in to the plane and said ""Take any seat available"" Hope restored!!! I didn't miss my flight and only had a 20 minute layover. So next time you think there is no way you'll make it, walk as fast as you can and have everything ready to get through TSA or customs. You might just make it!",3,1,2

It's one of the best airports in the country whether your flying out or staying due to a lay-over.  Here are some of my Top Reasons why this is one of the best airports: 
1 - it's clean especially comparing it to other major airports around the country.  Sky Harbor is the 10th busiest airport yet they manage to keep everything looking-smelling fresh
2 - easy to get around - the layout is super-duper easy to understand so there is less worry when trying to find your gate\/luggage\/car rental
3 - plenty of places to work on my laptop while waiting for a flight.  There are charging stations, plenty of restaurants-coffee places that offer places to charge your mobile devices
4 - some of the best coffee and places to eat in Phoenix are also located at Sky Harbor - LGO, Matt's Big Breakfast, Cowboy Ciao, Humble Pie, Delux, Press Coffee, Chelsea's Kitchen - all are terrific!
5 - the people that work in this airport are UBER friendly!  

I hope to see you sometime during your travels at Sky Harbor!  

Here are some fun factoids:
Did you know...
Sky Harbor is one of the ten busiest in the nation for passenger traffic with a $79 million daily economic impact.  On a typical day:
More than 1,200 aircraft arrive and depart
More than 111,000 passengers arrive and depart
More than 800 tons of air cargo is handled
The Phoenix Airport System (PHX Sky Harbor, PHX Goodyear and PHX Deer Valley airports), now including Sky Harbor Center, has a total econonmic impact of $28.7 billion.
The direct impact of Sky Harbor International Airport, including Sky Harbor Center, is $9.5 billion. 
Nonstop international flights from Sky Harbor create a $3.0 billion total economic impact within the Greater Phoenix metropolitan area. 
Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport is self-sufficient.",5,4,7

pros:
- organized and easy check in (though US Airways (in conjunction with AA) would not give me my second boarding pass so i have to check in again at my connection- that's a whole other airport's rant) 
- complimentary plastic zip baggies provided 
- 6 lines of security open (at check point B)!  so fast and easy!
- free wireless- is how i'm writing this!

cons:
- not really nice for the driver dropping me off
- once you you get to the gate area, if you're thirsty, it's water or vitamin water
- public breast feeding, blecht!!  put that shit away, find a lounge or something!
- emergency alarm going off right now- loud, clear, and flashy!

To add on top of this, it required me to go back through security. Of course due to my luck the line took like 25 minutes to get through. Some dumb people do not realize that you cannot take drinks from outside into the terminal. Thankfully my layover was about an hour long so I still had a little bit of time after to grab lunch.

Where's Terminal #1? Ok, so the airport has 3 major terminals---since I've flown Alaska\/Delta\/Southwest in the past year, I have arrived at Terminals 2,3, 4, respectively. One day I stopped to gaze at the map noticing there is no Terminal 1. Hmmm, this is odd. (Footnote: T1 was demolished in 1991 per the web site.)

How many of my friends met their significant other\/spouse in Sky Harbor? Answer is 2. I can't tell folks of any airport other than Sky Harbor where this has happened.

How much time do I need to allocate for a rental pickup\/return? Well, it depends on time of day and day of the week; but, 20-30 minutes is a bare minimum. I know there's a Sky Harbor train somewhere, but it's not connected to the rental cars.

Who runs the airport? Oddly, the City of Phoenix v some airport commission.

Are the Southwest terminals (Doors A,B, C and D) connected after going through the TSA line? Yes!....an undocumented feature is Terminal #4 is shaped like an inverse letter ""c"" in terms of layout. I suggest you enter semi-close to your flight, but if the line is crazy, simply switch entrances. A to D is the longest walk, but there are moving sidewalks.

There's free wifi and lot's of choices on food and drink. I've only been stuck here when it was too hot for planes to leave due to lack of lift and during the occasional thunderstorm. (Re-fueling isn't a great move.)

3. There are many parking options around this airport.

1. Right now there are separate terminals and if you change planes here you may have to go out of security and through again to get to another terminal. They are working on this with the sky train. But to be fair, I was once here when a crazy guy came after shooting someone in the face off site with his gun.

The American flights brought me into a concourse that offered a steep escalator to baggage.  The surrounding walls in that escalator passage were sandstone with striations like the desert outside.  Suspended above the moving stairs was a vintage prop plane.  Its cables came from a divine Crafstman, stylized skylight - assumedly referencing Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin that is one of Phoenix's attractions.

As for those snakes.  Never saw any.  No snakes on the plane.  No snakes in the airport.  I later asked a local who drove a shuttle about that scrolling news.

Today two of them were abrasively chastising an elderly women for forgetting to put her snacks in a bin (this is the only airport I use that insists snacks have to come out of your bags).",0,0,0

I remember having it with me in the flight from JFK cause the flight attendants didn't give me any blanket and I was freezing. My scarf kept me warm.

In Phoenix I was talking on the phone and the scarf probably fell from my overloaded purse. It wasn't until my next flight to Burbank that I realized it was missing. My heart sank.

I took a shot at emailing Phoenix airport about it and 2 days later I got an email saying a matching item was found!

Sky Harbor has several terminals and I have always passed through the main (America West) terminal in my travels to and from Phoenix.  It can get crowded, but hey, it's an airport.  Get used to it.

Terminal 2 however, 'home' to Continental and United Express flights, is the most abysmal place I've seen in a long time.  The 'security' guard I had to pass in order to get to the metal detectors was more interested in her split ends than in looking at my photo ID or checking that it actually matched the name on the ticket.  The Express flight gates are all housed in a small separate building that one must walk through an outdoor area in order to reach.  The entire terminal smells vaguely of mildew and disuse.  And all but one of the eating establishments is either boarded up or roped off and the place that is open...ewww.  

I ordered a pastrami and swiss from the less-than-friendly counter person and after discussing the appropriate change I should have received back for my $20 bill, I traveled down the smeared glass to pick up my to-go sandwich.  Which had morphed into ham.  I didn't order ham. Well the ticket says sandwich special and that's ham.  Excuse me, but your board says 'special Pastrami and Swiss or Ham and Swiss' and I did not order ham - I don't EAT ham.  Sandwich maker goes down the line to have discussion with counter-person.  I wait.  Impatiently.  I am exceedingly hungry as well as minorly hung-over and I just want my *&$%(#$&  food.  Finally, I get my pastrami and swiss on (grudgingly admitted) good rye bread.

Upon my arrival to Phoenix, I was graciously greeted as I entered the gate of the terminal for Southwest Airlines.

They have three main Terminals 2, 3, and 4 available (not sure what happened to Terminal 1). But majority of the airlines are located at Terminals 3 and 4. I flew into Terminal 4 and it's pretty much one of the larger terminals compared to the others. In Terminal 4, their major gates are A, B, C and D. 

Airlines that fly through here: Southwest, Air Canada, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, British Airways, Delta Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, Frontier Airlines are just to name a few.

Walking around like a lost child, I found directions from a cheerful, friendly employee who was able to help me find my way. In addition there were large directory maps to show you where to go if you were lost and also showed departures\/arrivals. Using that, I was able to meet up with the parentals in Terminal C.

FYI =
- Free WiFi
- Tax ~9%
- Many of the shops\/restos are native to Phoenix (LGO, Olive & Ivy, Chelsea's Kitchen, and Barrio Cafe are just to name a few)
- Golf cart drivers available to transport you around the PHX airport (from gate to gate)
- Paging Assistance Locator (PAL) available to hollah at your lost ones
- Car rentals are all located in the same place, you must take a shuttle to get there

Spent a good amount of time at this airport, partly because of work related events, but to get to the point, this airport felt small but a good enough size where one won't get lost. 

Arrival:

The first impression I got from this airport upon landing felt totally different as if I were to ever fly in to LAX.  Personnel were so friendly, and the people of Arizona felt so warm...not like those angry people at LAX!

Upon arriving at the jetbridge at Terminal 2 with United, stepped foot out, and walked out for about 5 minutes, coming to realize that I had already arrived at the baggage carousel.  Very easy to navigate, and find right away.

After picking up my bag which literally only took eight minutes to wait upon aircraft blocking into its gate, my co-workers and I headed straight out to the van\/courtesy shuttle stop.  

Departure:

After my co-workers and I dropped off our rental car vehicle at its hub, we boarded a rental car shuttle bus to the airline terminals, which was such a breeze.  A friendly bus driver dropped us off at Terminal 4, where we were able to aboard an American flight back to LA.

Checking in with American was a breeze, but more impressively were the TSA officers.  This airport is facilitated with friendly and nice TSA officers, not like those ones at LAX, that literally don't give a you know what about you.  No stupid pat down, and cleared security within a few minutes.  

Terminal 4 doesn't offer too many shops or restaurants beyond TSA checkpoint, but for what it offers was enough to kill some time.  

Waiting around an hour or so to board for the flight, my co-workers hopped into a bar and grabbed a few drinks, and waited for our flight to start boarding.

Boarding with American was once again a breeze.  Didn't wait long, and shortly enough, wheels up to smoggy Los Angeles.

Overall:

I really like this airport a lot!  The people are friendly, it's small enough where one won't get lost, and it's quite clean, unlike LAX, where if you walk into the bathroom at Terminal 8 (United's terminal), you're literally taking a dump in the beaches of LA.

We had to drag our luggage up 2 levels to a tram car that showed an arrow going to Terminal 2 & 3 pointing in one direction so naturally we got on in the direction of the arrow only to find out we were going the wrong way so we had to get off the train and wait. 

After a short wait a train arrived going back the other way.  First to Terminal 4 (our original start point), then back to Terminal 3 where we were told we had to go back down to ground level and either walk or jump on a cart with our luggage back to Terminal 2.

OK, The Sopwith Camel was cool. Same thing with the plaster, Disneyesque fake rockface underneath it.  I appreciated the free Wi-Fi, even if you didn't have power outlets available. (Or if you did, I didn't see any in that nook next to Starbucks.)  But two huge negatives haunt me.  First, the entire having to go through security to reach your terminal thing sucks.  What I mean by that is, instead of going through a single TSA line and then having access to multiple options once you get past the checkpoint, you go through the line and then only have access to the options near your gate and only near your gate.  This is a major criterion on which I judge airports because if, say, you're flying a red-eye and every option in that particular terminal is closed, then you have to go through security multiple times.  I realize that there are other terminals, since it isn't obvious how to actually GET to the other terminals (unlike Atlanta's underground train), you're on an island.  Which leads me to my second complaint.

Everything was freaking closed!  Yeah, I was taking a redeye, but at 10pm on a Friday, I expected at least ONE thing open.  (And not just the Starbucks.)  Maybe there are other terminals with options catering to a later crowd, but I fly Delta and, had I not packed a couple granola bars, the flight would've sucked more than normal.  So to people who decry Atlanta Hartsfield's gargantuan size, imagine the other option...an option where Wendy's and some random burrito place sit, darkened and mocking your hungry, hungry ass.

I honestly can't remember the last time I've flown another airline other than Southwest (or occasionally US Airways\/America West) so pretty much this entire review is for terminal 4, which IMO is pretty nice. It's clean, the lines move pretty fast (whether it's for security or to check-in), and there's a lot of different food options. Speaking of food options, one thing I do recommend (time permitting) is the food court BEFORE the security check. There's a lot of options here. Off the top of my head Paradise Bakery, Chili's, & Flo's come to mind, but I know there's a lot more. That's not to say you don't have options once your past security (Nathan's, Pizza Hut, Blue Burrito, and standard cheesy airport bars come to mind), but I just find the options on the other side more appealing. 

Once you're past security and closer to the gates there's a lot of seating, but finding an outlet for electronics is limited (like at most airports) but not horrible. And yes, like others have mentioned there is FREE Wi-fi, but at times it can be slow, but I guess it's better than nothing (I fly out of SFO where you have to pay for Internet). 

One pretty big thing to not about this airport...and I'm not sure if this is a good thing or bad thing, but security is pretty tight. If there's ANYTHING that seems suspicious\/over-sized liquids they will find it, and you'll have to get rid of it (or check it in). I guess this isn't a bad thing since it means they have good security, but it can be annoying. The same carry-on bags that I'm easily able to get through security at other airports I always check-in here, since I KNOW (yes, this always happens without fail) my face wash, hair products, and cologne will be confiscated. 

Oh, I guess another thing I should note is that this airport used to be NOTORIOUS for having a super slow baggage claim. Nine times out of ten though I don't check-in bags coming into this airport, but the last time I did have to check a bag in, it actually came out pretty fast, so I don't know if the slow baggage claim is still the case.

For an airport for the nation's 5th largest city, you'd expect more out of it (especially if you end up in Terminal 2), but I'll break it down for the good, the bad, and the ugly, because I'm a nice guy.

THE GOOD:

* Free Wi-Fi! Seriously, folks. It's awesome. Every other airport in the US and Europe, take note. This is how it's done. Is it my fault that US Airways had delayed my flight by 2 hours, AGAIN? No. Therefore, I should be able to surf the web aimlessly at my leisure. Who in their right mind pays $20\/month for T-Mobile hotspot access anyway?

* It's close to where I live. That just happens to be coincidence. Although the 10-51-202 ministack is a nightmare to behold if you or someone you're picking up\/dropping off happens to have an afternoon rush hour flight. 

* Ample long-term parking on or off airport premises with plenty of shuttles taking you every which way.

* Decent food choices in Terminal 4, including Paradise Bakery and some Chinese food grill, although once you're past security and in your far flung wing for your US Airways gate, there isn't much to choose from besides Pizza Hut and a mediocre mexican cantina. 


THE BAD:

* The way the roads are designed, you can easily miss where you want to go. Signs leading to freeways get confusing, especially the first time when you had no idea that there was an eastbound north side and a westbound south side. The park-n-wait areas aren't marked well enough in advance and you have a high likelihood of missing them and end up circling around in traffic anyway. This brings me up to:

* Traffic. Especially in the arrivals area of Terminal 4's north curb. SUCKS. I've now wisened up to entering on 44th Street instead and telling people to come out on the south curb. Saves me a lot of road rage. Especially when people decide the passenger loading zone is the perfect place to make out for 5 minutes. Postpone your flight and get a room at the airport hotel, people. 

* Why are my gate assignments always at the farthest ones possible? Moving walkways only carry their charm the first few times. After the 15th go around, it just becomes a pain in the ass.

* Why are people in Phoenix more predisposed to carrying their little yippy purse dogs with them than anywhere else? This is a phenomenon I have yet to solve. 

* Public transportation. Pretty much nonexistent to anywhere useful. You'd think out of all this light rail hoo-ha they'd have a line coming into the airport linking it to downtown and also to Tempe. But that would mean it would make sense. Never mind. 

THE UGLY:

* Baggage claim. Nothing is worse than being 5 minutes from home and waiting for an hour for your bag to come out. Not once has my bag appeared on the carousel in less than 45 minutes. If Phoenix is going to continue growing in size as well as a tourist\/convention destination, they're really going to need to sort this out or there will be a luggage breakdown at some point (or a mass nervous breakdown among travelers who've celebrated two rounds of birthdays before their bags finally appeared).

So, all in all, ugly baggage claim + free WiFi + everything else = 3 stars. Don't know how I came up with this star rating. Just trust me.",7,2,5

First of all, a few of the terminals have North and South curbs, which can be confusing if you are not familiar with this airport... sometimes they will shut down one of the curbs and you won't find out until you show up at the airport.  

It can also be hard to navigate how to find your terminal because some of the signs are not so great ... I have literally run into instances where taxi drivers\/uber\/lyft drivers get lost, confused, and turned around in this airport.

Big minus one star for having off-site care rental.. No one wants to have to take a not insignificant bus ride after a 5 hour flight from the east coast. 
Usually at this point you hate most modes of transportation anyway (US Airways I'm looking firmly in your direction)...and having to lug your luggage up and down more times than you would need to at other airports with on-site car rentals is just not going to create a positive experience with the traveler.

And finally, not enough power outlets for charging mobile devices!! In this day and age these should be ubiquitous! But instead, one sees tired looking business people sitting on the floor around a charging tower with the life draining out of their eyes.

I've never gone through security here before. I live in OKC and love our sweet little airport, but departing from Sky Harbor, I now appreciate how well-designed and thoughtfully considered our airport is. 

So, here are just a few things that I think need a serious overhaul:

-They didn't check my ID as I went into the line for TSA. They only looked at my boarding pass. This is weird, because it seems to me this is the one place where you have enough control to make sure you check every single person's ID against the name on the boarding pass. 

-The lines for security are whack. You pick from one of three lines, which we will call A, B and C that feed to two people, who we will call right and left. Well, left is not only pulling from A, she's also pulling from D, the pre-approved frequent travelers who use a different line. Then you have right taking from C. No one is taking from B, which unfortunately was the line I was in. Other travelers clearly saw that we had been there for a while. When the third person who arrived after us breezed through without regard, I finally got pushy and spoke up. Why not have one line that feeds into the next available agent? 

-The bag scanning line is built around a 90-degree angle, so you have to move your bags several times. There is also not much room to line up so you can't work very far ahead of your exact turn to walk through, so you waste a lot of time standing in line when you could be prepping your bins. It also seems like it would be safer in general if the agents could look down a long line and see what's happening. A lady walked through the scanner before she had pushed her bag up onto the ramp, and I felt really weird. I didn't want to move it, because it's not mine and if there is something bad in there I don't want to be seen touching it. But the alternative is to risk watching someone leave a bag behind. I had to get an agent but that took some work. 

-I actually overheard the woman doing the body scan say, ""I'm doing the bare minimum today."" Somehow that is not comforting to me. 

- Finally, when you arrive at the crowded gate area to board your flight, they have rows 1-5 line up at the same time, with groups snaking over into each other's lines. It was at this point that someone came over to check my ID against my boarding pass. There's no way of knowing you really checked everyone at this point. Plus you're weaving your way through five lines of people, weighted down by bags, who have to find their IDs again. It's just weird. 

I'll keep OKC's streamlined, thoughtful procedures and nice staff any day.",11,4,5

Terminal 3 might be worthy of 3 stars, although it's been years since I've used it, Terminal 2 is definitely only worth 2 stars, and Terminal 1 probably only gets 1 star for being either non-existent or closed to the public.

Here's my take on Terminal 4:
A couple great food options -- I prefer the little Mexican Food restaurant by the D gates, or else I'll usually just try to grab something at Paradise before heading through security.  I try to stay away from all the HMS Host places except for the little walk-up burrito window, but when I really need a drink, I just remember that a beer\/whiskey combo is the best value.

When traveling on business, I love the fact that I can park right above the terminal, hop on an elevator, and be at my gate in a few minutes.  When traveling with the family, however, I think the off-property parking businesses do a far better job of getting you to Terminal 4 in a hurry. Never again will I use the airport's long term parking (although, I would still consider it at Terminal 2 because it's so convenient).

It is the best place to fly in and out of, especially during the winter months. They could have a better restaurant selection, but it's not too bad, if you have time you can grab California Pizza, or burritos or some drinks at a few different bars. It is still odd too me to see people drinking in the morning before flying, I wonder is that just to ease their nerves, or do they always chug a couple beers at 8am?

You're going to have to take a bus to catch the cab or convince your friend to illegally snatch you in the cab they hail (which is what I had to do, not a fan because sadly I am a die hard rule abider).

I guess this is a popular airport either for residents coming and going or as a stop off point for other flights.  

Our boarding process was very lengthy, but at least efficient and smooth without any delays, as airport staff kept everyone moving along.  What I could gather from the airport from my small perspective, was that there were not enough seating areas for the large crowds of people waiting.  Many stood around or sat on the floor.  Bathrooms were clean and accommodating with little to no wait time. There were several crowded restaurants, fast food places, coffee stops and shops.  We were able to kill some time by patronizing ""Matt's Big Breakfast"" and have a few cocktails.  We even had some friendly conversation with another waiting passenger seated next to us at the bar.

The moving walkways are literally the width of 1.5 people without luggage.  Add luggage and there is no utility to the ""stand right, walk left"" display they always hang overhead.  People chose to stand on the walkway, talking on their cellphones while their luggage is taking up the whole space.  Obviously, running while on a moving walkway is a much faster way to make your connecting flight, but not if you are caught behind someone chatting up a storm on their ""cool"" bluetooth headset, not listening to you huffing and puffing right behind them.

Luckily, since I hate US Airways and rarely fly Southwest anymore, I am rarely here anymore. That being said, occasionally I actually DO end up in Phoenix, so I'm certainly familiar with PHX.

Connecting is fine, as long as you stay on the same airline. The airport can be large, but the airlines that you connect on (really just Southwest and US Airways) keep their operations pretty compacted so it's never very hard to connect. Once, I flew in on Southwest and my friends were flying in about 20 minutes later on US Airways. I had no problem wandering over and meeting them at their gate with time for a Starbucks stop along the way. Food choices are ""meh""...overall appearance of the airport is ""meh"", but it gets the job done. One thing is that if connecting over the summer, and there are lines waiting for takeoff, it can get hot in the plane in that nasty Arizona summer sun. That stinks. 

As an origin\/destination airport, it's not so great. It's fairly close to downtown which is nice, but that also results in some pretty heavy traffic on the highways at times, which can add a chunk of time to your comings and goings. The rental car facility is also more or less in Tucson and can take forever to get to\/from.

PHX does not have the rental car vendors attached to the terminal. Instead, you get to take a ten minute shuttle bus ride to the rental car pavilion where they are all represented.

I actually am a fan of Sky Harbor International overall. It has vastly improved over the years and once the new light rail was up and running, it became a lot of fun for me to head out to the airport (without anyone having to take me) to catch my flights. But I have to be honest about things. This airport is a little quirky. Originally, the light rail would take you to 44th Street and Washington and from there you would take a nice air conditioned bus that would glide through to all of the terminals and work it's way back around to the parking structure and back to the bus stop across the street from the light rail stop. 

However, once the SkyTrain came on the scene Sky Harbor decided the shuttles were no longer needed to pick folks up from the light rail station. This is a mistake in my view. The reason this is important is because the SkyTrain ONLY goes to terminal 4. After that it turns around back towards the parking structure and back to the end of the line where the escalator meets the long hallway that leads to the light rail station. 

The problem is having to get off of the SkyTrain and head downstairs to the nearest shuttle stop and wait for one to take you to another terminal. There are only a few signs telling you where to catch the shuttle and so it is easy to get lost looking for where to go. Additionally, it takes much more time to get to your terminal this way. In this regard, because the SkyTrain is not complete yet (despite the city promoting it like it is) Phoenix is still behind Las Vegas, Dallas, and LA. And that is a bit annoying. 

Regarding the security lines and the TSA. They are not the slowest I've seen, but at busy hours it can be a little while before getting through. Contrast that with Las Vegas, which had many agents working to make the lines go faster and to get us all through quickly. There's a noticeable difference in our security versus others in the region. I know it isn't necessarily Sky Harbor's fault, but it does factor into how people view the airport. 

In terms of changing terminals, I've done it twice and it is a nightmare. Time consuming and because of the ""Arizona-style"" outdoor nature between the terminals, you will have to go through TSA security again. And that's never fun to do twice in a day let alone twice in the same airport with limited time between flights. 

The seating and overall atmosphere of terminal 2 is shabby and outdated. It is a relic of Arizona history, which shows you a glimpse into a time when Phoenix only needed a small terminal to service everyone coming and going. The bathrooms look like they are from the 1980s and it sucks to be there. Terminal 3 is slightly better, but still with outdated seats and areas where the carpet is screaming to be cleaned or changed out. And terminal 4, the flagship terminal of Arizona, well it's average at best. The food options are more plentiful than the others, but there is far more foot traffic and the seating is still only decent with few plug-ins or outlets for electronic devices. Quite far behind even an airport I was at in Guatemala. Seriously. 

Despite the criticisms I outlined here, Sky Harbor could be much worse and my flights have always been on time here. The SkyTrain will eventually be finished, thus shutting up my major gripe about the place and the people working there really are friendlier than other airports I've been to. In the end, it isn't good as Dallas or bad as LA. Just about where Phoenix always is, right in the middle. Average. Decent. Respectable, but not a threat to the current 'chain of command' regarding regional airport leaders.",0,0,0

This airport ranks near the bottom for me, mainly due to the lack of outlets.  They've got a few of those standalone charging stations around, but every time I've gone through here, I see people playing the charger shuffle - walk around the concrete columns to see if there's an outlet, look along the walls, see someone else charging and grab a seat near them so you can take the outlet when they leave.

The seating and the like feel to be very dated - this is the kind of airport design I'd have expected to see in the 90s, not today.  

While some gripe about the design of Terminal 4, I'm okay with it.  I've never had trouble making connections, but it does feel like I see more people running through this airport than others.

One benefit of the large distance between gates in Terminal 4 is that if you do have time to kill, there's plenty of opportunity to walk - everyone seems to stick to the people movers, so the aisle in the middle is super long - they've even branded this as the Sky Harbor Fitness Trail, and it's a little over a mile from end to end.

In any case, it's not like I have too much choice about what airport I end up going through, as I tend to go for the cheapest flight the four or so times I fly a year.  I just really wish they'd upgrade the gates so the seating was more modern, and put in outlets at the seats like every other airport seems to have done . . .",2,0,0

There's also an indescribably long moving sidewalk which I quite enjoyed. One of those strips of moving traction that Ellen DeGeneres said is like a ride in the middle of nowhere. Truth. In a moment of blissful immaturity, my friend and I tried running backwards on them. It may have ended in bumping into foreign businessmen, but it was worth it.

Normally the other terminals are either connected within or there are clear directions to a shuttle bus which takes you directly to the other terminals without requiring a security check. Not this shithole.

I had to leave the airport, take a general airport shuttle to the correct terminal, then go through security again. Maybe I am an idiot, but I took the wrong shuttle bus and ended up at car rental instead of terminal 2. Because of this confusing bullshit, I was almost late for my connecting plane.  The assholes who gave me directions probably should have mentioned something about getting on the right shuttle.

Sunday nights are an especially busy time that I've had layovers at Sky Harbor. Many business travelers make their weekly commutes through Sky Harbor and the crowds are big as a result. The plus side of this is because the fact that this place gets so much traffic, there are lots of amenities and places to grab food and drinks. I've never had trouble finding a coffee or a magazine in any of Sky Harbors terminals.

Instead, those of us who are using these devices end up fighting over the coveted spaces that have been equipped with charging stations. I've noticed that some of the seats have outlets built in along the bottom of the chairs. Why can't more of these updated seats be added to the airports? Not everyone needs a small workspace area as I've noticed in some airports.

I once had a 4 hour delay here that was pretty fun. I learned to lay on my luggage while trying to recline in a chair, or find a comfy seat on the ground by a plug outlet. It was for work though so at least I was getting paid.

This airport is HUGE. It has many terminals that all look the same so I could easily see getting lost and turned around in here. There are a few OK restaurants, but otherwise nothing really good to eat.

I like trying to see the sights from one of the many airport windows, and walking on the moving walkways connecting each of the terminals because it makes navigating between them much faster.

The Bad: Parking in their garage can cost you dearly, relocation of offsite parking shuttles, terminal 3's somewhat confusing layout, Terminal 2

Being a person who frequents this airport, I can tell you it is not Incheon nor Dubai.  However, it is a decent sized facility that can accommodate larger aircraft.  Many of the gates now have newer jetways to accommodate the larger A321s and could easily accommodate the A330s\/340s.

Food options are decent, even though scarce in some terminals.  However, that is changing.  They are building restaurants such as McDonald's and adding new ones such as Starbucks.  Even baggage claim has a Starbucks.  

The above is mostly about Terminal 4 but Terminal 3 has good food options but the terminal is very dated.  Has a fairly confusing layout to the unfamiliar.

Terminal 2 is even more dated.  Shame that United and other carriers use this terminal when spaces are available at 3.

One of the biggest problems I have with the airport is how the off-site parking shuttles are positioned.  The best way to describe the area is chaotically dangerous.  It is literally at the end of the airport where traffic at different points merges and in front of the corporate cars.  Just imagine a parking or hotel shuttle trying to get in and a corporate car trying to get out with traffic whizzing past between 35-50 mph.  Herding cats would be more orderly.",1,0,0

The TSA folks here also seem to smile and playfully banter with travelers more readily than at other airports. Perhaps this is due in part to Sky Harbor's ""America's Friendliest Airport"" marketing ploy, but in any case it's certainly something to remark about.

I doubt Phoenix will turn into any sort of true travel hub in the near future, but more non-stop international flights would certainly be welcomed. But until the demand is clearly defined we'll have to be content with a few flights to Europe, Canada, Mexico, and the lone wolf to Costa Rica.

I am very excited to see the Sky Train completed and operational with Stage One scheduled to be up and running in 2013. This will allow connections from the light rail and offer a new mode of transportation from the east economy lot to terminal 4.

I've seen previous reviews complaining about having to go back through security when changing terminals, which is actually the case in many airports throughout the world. The terminal is the secure area so whenever you leave it you naturally have to be screened again. There are a few exceptions, but the easiest way to circumvent this is to fly the same airline from point A all the way to point B. If you're connecting at Sky Harbor you should only be flying US Airways\/United or Southwest so as to avoid a terminal change. If you're not flying these carriers then you're over-complicating things for yourself and you should look for different routing.

The central location of Sky Harbor makes it extremely accessible for people living in most parts of the valley, which is a huge plus considering the location of other airports outside of their corresponding metropolitan areas. All in all, there's really nothing significant to complain about Sky Harbor.

P.S. The Fox Sports Grill at Sky Harbor is a true embarrassment, not that one should expect a great deal from airport restaurants, but if Kraft Mac-N-Cheese (this is probably a poor example as KMNC provides a perfect vehicle for some truly delicious creations) is far superior to what you're serving, then you should just end it all.

+ SkyTrain! this is a much needed, the convenient of taking this to the Light Rail station is cool, from the Light Rail you can plan your route home and vice versa to the airport

+ USB charging stations at the Departure Gates with FREE WIFI

The only complaint I have is the SIGN where you first drive into the airport telling you which airline is at which terminal--it needs improvement.  What happens if you are talking and you miss the initial signs? Now I don't know where to drop somebody off at.  Even if I was to look it up on the phone, it's not long before we have to decide which terminal to go to since its coming up quick.  Maybe this info is on the plane ticket? I don't recall.

Dropping off and picking up is generally smooth.  Exiting the freeway is not the easiest thing here either.  You must pay close attention with the arrows else you will be circling around and around.",12,8,10

Here's the one major downside of this airport - and I've been flying here for 10 years and it's been the same almost every time - picking up your bags can easily take 30 to 45 minutes. There are frequent delays and often at least one carousel change. Forget about it if you're traveling with kiddos. I suggest assigning a parent or friend, not a stranger, to watch your child away from the carousel while you wait for luggage. There is plenty of room for them to run, twirl, crawl (mine's done it all) away from the carousel. It will be less stress for everyone.

I put in a lot of time here, either working or passing through so I feel like a review isn't just recommended.  It's expected!  This is a solid airport but there's a huge difference between the terminals where the carriers the port authority cares about fly into and the ones where they put the carriers that don't give them as much money.  

You can tell Terminal 2 is old.  The concessions are tired: a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, Wendy's, an obligatory HMS Host restaurant called All Star and a Round Table Pizza that tastes nothing like Round Table pizza.  A Fox News stand and a Hudson News.  The TSA checkpoint is poorly organized and slow in the mornings when the crowds are thickest.  Before you go past TSA, there's practically nothing if you're hungry.  Just Ocatillo Sun for drinks and sandwiches or a Hudson News for snacks.  

Terminal 4 is a different story.  It has a small museum with changing exhibits, shopping, a drug store, Chili's Too, a Mexican restaurant, Paradise Bakery which is a pretty good sandwich shop all on its own, Coldstone Creamery, and a Famous Famiglia (I think --- I get these fast Italian places mixed up) and Burger King.  These are all before security, too.  It's a big terminal with 4 concourses.  C & D belong to Southwest and A & B belong to US Airways and each concourse has its own set of restaurants.

Haven't flown international so I can't tell you anything about Terminal 3.  This airport also features volunteers in purple coats that will cordially give you information.  The parking and signage are well marked and reasonable.  When I left, they charged $8 for daily parking in the shuttle serviced economy lots ($10 for covered if you are in the East EL) and $25 for daily parking for the lots within walking distance of the terminal.

So this time I was just changing planes San Diego to Milwaukee via Phoenix on US Airways.

If you are changing planes, make sure you give yourself enough time to get from terminal to terminal because the walk is looooong.

As someone else mentioned, it does feel a little dated... brown leather seats, maroon\/brown carpeting... I understand the Southwest theme, but it could use an update.  There seems to be a lack of seating in some areas... my gate was clustered with three other gates at the end of the building and there were people sitting all over the floor, people standing while most of the seats around the gates were filled.  And in looking around, there was plenty of space to add more seating without getting in the way.

Some areas in the terminal have more options for food and shops, so you may want to make a note of it or stop on the way to your gate.  On other areas, you may be more limited... there was an shop and a ""cafe"".  The cafe is where I had breakfast, but it wasn't that great... I should've just gone for a pastry, but their Dark French Roast Coffee was awesome and I'm so glad they have giant to-go cups.

Maybe there wasn't a lot of land to make longer rows of gates, or they couldn't use a curved or circular system instead of wing after wing after wing of gates.

I landed in A Terminal and did the math in my head on board that there were maybe 10 gates between where I landed to where I was leaving from, but it turned out to be in a whole different wing which was probably 10 to 15 minutes away via two moving walkways and a pretty good walk down two corridors of gates.

Once you arrive at your gate there are few chairs and fewer outlets to recharge your phone or iPod.  Some of the gates are jammed together so it's hard to tell which gate is which and which flight is departing.  It's the usual set of shops with some newer food choices none of which have so far been outstanding.  Even the club closes relatively early.

So I always dread changing planes in Phoenix unless I check all my bags and have a very small carryon and have plenty of time to get from gate to gate and then my flight leaves almost right away.

So apparently this weekend, Nascar (among 1,000 other things) was in town.  I had a 12:40AM to ATL Monday morning.  Leaving Hohokam Park around 9PM (about 6-7 miles from SH), I didn't get to the f'n car rental center (a whole different story) until 10:30.  

Who's genius idea was it to close the airport exit and re-direct traffic from a 4 lane to a one-lane bottleneck into the airport?  That could have been the dumbest, most inefficient thing I have seen since DC shut the interstate near RFK.  Traffic was unbelievable.  And I didn't realize it took another 15 minutes to get to the car rental ""center"".

After finally getting to the terminal, check in was slow, considering the amount of people they should have been expecting (they had red-eyes going to CHI, JFK, and ATL, amongst other places).  Getting to security was ridiculous- I would have rather gotten a handy from TSA then the circus they were running.  Apparently, waving my sunscreen in the air ""who's is this?""  I should have told them it was my buttplug.   I told them, they said I could check it, but I couldn't let it go.  Cya, sunscreen.  

Another fascinating aspect was I had my cough syrup, hand sanitizer, and my lighter on me.  They could care less about the lighter.  The hand-gel - gone.  And my syrup, they made me take my stuff, and open it, they were testing it for God-only-knows. They didn't care about checking my ID to make sure the contents were mine though, just to make sure it wasn't on their list?  Is that not ass-backwards?

Finally getting through, there wasn't shit open to eat or shop, a big no-no for people trying to get the hell home- I mean after taking 2 hours to go 6 miles that gets you hungry!

This time I flew US Airways which pretty much dominates Terminal 4 - A & B Gates. The almost 60 gates are spread out into four wings connected by moving walkways.

On my way west, I arrived in the far A gate and my connecting flight was in the far B gate. I had an hour in between flights. This allowed me just enough time to casually walk the six or so moving walkways, use the restroom and grab a bottle of water. I must mention that I was also wearing heels, which slowed me down considerably since I haven't worn heels in a long time! So, if you are traveling with children, aren't fast on your feet or want time to grab some food, I would recommend booking flights that have a longer connection time.

On my way back, I had an hour again but was in comfortable shoes; so, I was able to quickly walk between the wings with time enough to grab a snack. The only issue I had was that my departing gate was in the end of the wing. The gates are closer together and the waiting area is smaller. Out of the four or five gates within view, at least three of them were attempting to board at the same time. This caused some confusion amongst the crowd. I think it would be smart to stagger departing flights or at least have the announcers say the flight number every time they make an announcement. That's more of a problem for US Airways, but I thought it would be helpful to warn people to be aware of other departing flight announcements.",2,0,0

By that time, I had just minutes to make it to my flight back to Hawaii (home). I finally found an ""assistance"" desk on my way past the luggage pickup.

Let's face it, if you fly East to West with any regularity at all, it is only a matter of time before you find yourself at Sky Harbor.

Other benefits are decent options for food in the terminals, tons of charging stations\/wall outlets, and even numerous bathrooms.

The only downside of Sky Harbor is that its size can make catching connecting flights difficult particularly when flights are late, which happens often when the weather is bad out east. That and the spotty cell phone reception in areas.

Back in the day, this airport was one of the better airports around (i.e. free wifi, clean, big, easy, stress-free, etc).  I think this airport could use additional terminals and gates.  Even though this airport looks like Vegas' McCarran, it's nowhere near as stress-free as them. Sky Harbor is known for their layovers and this means a ton of inside traffic.

Try finding somewhere to sit while you wait for your plane, good luck with that. 

Another issue with the fact that this is an airport that has a ton of layovers is the travel between gates.  Usually layovers are around an hour which seems like plenty of time, but calculate the half hour early boarding time, rest room break, quick snack, and no concourse.

My flight arrives at 9:15 or so, and I'm already unhappy because a poor corporate travel agent didn't tell me that ""direct"" flights are not always ""non-stop"" flights and that while I had only one plane to SFO, I had to get off it at least once during the return. So I arrive and deplane so they can move the Airbus to another gate (?), and since there's a 90 minute layover, I go in search of food and drink. 

First, I sense the skeeviness. It couldn't have smelled like stale cigarettes in the terminal (no smoking!), yet somehow I felt it did.  Maybe it was the beige decor, straight out of 1974, and the dingy looking carpet.

""It's 9:15!""

Ponder the consequences.  Head toward the A's, since that's where my plane will end up in an hour.  Take one walkway.  Take another walkway. A new concourse appears over the horizon.  

*Rumble* *Rumble* *Slam!* 

Crap.

There's some activity at the end of the concourse, and I see some kind of Tequila-themed bar. Seating!  Non-chain Mexican food!  People!  I walk in, sit down, pick up a menu from a pile on the bar, look around for service.

*Waitress approaches*

""Hi! Can I have a...""

*Waitress pulls menu out of my hands, returns it to the pile, straightens the pile with obvious annoyance*

*With back turned* ""No more food.  Drinks."" 

I get up and walk out, and see a crowd forming at the California Pizza Kitchen.  Something!  An Ethiopian family is capitalizing on the food shortage and the pizzas are flying in and out of the faux-wood oven. Short wait. I order.

""Four cheese, please. Thanks for staying open!""

""Hey man, people keep paying, I keep making pizzas.""

I get my pizza, take it to the food court, and eat while a crew cleans up around me, eventually putting a chair up on to the other end of the table I'm eating at.  Still a hour until my flight goes, and there were at least 3 or 4 flights leaving an hour or more after that.  Can we relax a bit?  The pizza guy keeps cranking 'em out, and the latest customers are just standing around shoveling slices directly from the box for lack of a place to sit.  A soda fountain, affiliated with some other fast food joint and clearly disgusted by the scene, makes a rude noise and spontaneously expels several gallons of water onto the floor. It runs down a slight slope to soak a large section of beige carpet. I'll bet that'll smell nice tomorrow.

I leave the food area and walk toward my gate, looking forward to sitting on plastic and vinyl benches for the next 55 minutes.  As I walk past the Tequila place, the bartender bellows:

""OK, people!  Time to head out.  You don't have to go home but you can't stay here!""

Oh yeah, I like this airport a whole hell of a lot. 

-extremely easy to navigate between gates in the terminal 
-super fast check in (just about as fast as Kansas City, which is a much smaller airport) 
-courteous security personal and getting past it is a breeze. I didn't even mind them throwing out my open bottle of water that I stupidly forgot to take out of my bag (I guess they are trained so that this airport lives up to its reputation. St. Louis Airport: you need to send your security personnel to train in Phoenix).
-adequate food and beverage choices pre- and post security gate 
-bright and sparkling clean environs (Yeah, so it's dated. At least it's not dated and dingy. It also seems in keeping with a lot of the design styles I've encountered in my 5 days in Phoenix).
-good amount of bathrooms, clean and no lines
-gate\/flight info is easy to find anywhere
-stunning view of the landscape from the wall of windows at the end of Gate D
-baggage area is clearly labeled and easy to navigate 
-good signage all over
-there are tiny finches instead of rats hopping along on the floor looking for food (At LaGuardia, you're far more likely to find the latter...oh and btw I mention this because one just ran past my feet and my instinct was to jump up out of my seat. But imagine my delight upon seeing a cute bird instead of a filthy rodent! Woohoo!!)

Spending time airports is a regular occurrence for me and I dare say that this time has been a pleasurable experience.

Only negatives: Not enough outlets (as is typical, SWA provides those uncomfortable bars you can sit at to plug in). Internet may be free but it's hella slow. At least it was today.

Southwest Airline introduced an internet special for certain domestic flights to certain cities. Earlier in the month, I booked a non-stop flight from Oakland International Airport to Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix for $69.00 one way and another $69.00 to comeback. Including the necessary fees and other BS, the total comes to nearly $200.00. My flight was supposed to leave Oakland at 11am. But for some uncanny reason, the flight had a 10 minute delay; therefore we left quarter after 11am. Despite leaving later than the supposed time, my flight landed smoothly in Phoenix a little after 2pm (Arizona time).

The airport is nicer and quieter than three Bay Area airports. I'm just going to be here for a couple of days.

Plus, since I've had several family members and friends come in and out, I've had really positive experiences picking them up as well.

My most recent visit was to Terminal 3, and it was really fun and easy getting in and out of here. I was dropped off by a friend, went inside and checked my luggage.

I hate running down my battery, so I try to plug it in when and where I can.  More challanging to find a plug if the airports busy, but its big enough to find one if you really scour.

I also like that theres plenty of places to eat in AND out of the security area.  Makes waiting for a flight much easier, because if I want a cup of coffee, bagel, or something more substantial, I don't have to go through security to get it.  I've taken a few friends to the airport, parked the car, and gone in and had a quick bite to eat with them before their flight takes off.  I've also helped my mom navigate this place as well for when she gets into town so she knows where shes going.  My dad? not so much.  He prefers to navigate his own way.  LOL.

Also, there's plenty of ground transportation here, so you can grab a taxi, super shuttle or what not to get a ride home in case you do not have one.  

Even though I have never used it, there's also plenty of on and off site parking here as well.  Off site is obviously cheaper, and most of the spots have coupons along with regular shuttles to and from the lots to the terminals.  I also like how the light rail connects to Sky Harbor as well.

I am a Cali girl through and through...but one of the best things about Phoenix (if you're a traveler) is the outstanding PHX airport.  No other airport can hold a candle to the ease, convenience, parking, cleanliness, even aesthetics of this airport.  Hardly any trouble ever going through TSA, parking is always a breeze...terminals have very nice amenities (my one exception is the Jet Blue terminal shops close way too early and so the midnight JFK flight one cannot purchase water, or anything).  And of course PHX is wonderfully located and offers tons of nonstops.  So although Arizona is a nice place to visit (or in my case plan conferences) and living here is a challenge..the ease of PHX is one huge plus.  Do you HEAR ME DFW????? Miami????",0,0,0

First point to note: none of the terminals are internally connected. This means that you have to exit the terminal, take the shuttle, the go through security check again in your second terminal. Not cool especially when you are traveling with a grandmother who needs wheelchair assistance.

Second point: if you're flying united or transferring to united, you're in for a surprise seeing as the united terminal is the original terminal from the 60s. Food places close very early and are all located closer to the front of the terminal.

Third point: if you're taking a flight with someone who needs wheelchair assistance, you'd better hope that your flight is earlier because once you get past maybe 11pm, anyone who might have been able to help you will have disappeared.

A TSA agent told me I needed to leave  the terminal, exit security, get on a shuttle to transfer to terminal 3. After getting to terminal 3, again no signage directing to gates.  I also had no boarding pass, so I'd have to find a check in window.  Another TSA agent directed me where to go.  Here's where it gets really fun.

I don't travel as much as some but I do travel often. When arriving at the airport last week, check in was simple and quick. I entered the security check in line, my ID was checked and handed back to me without issue. The lady sitting at that station was nice and friendly. Upon moving onto the next step in the process, there was a woman shuffling and sorting the line into 2 sections. 1 meant to go through the metal detector, the other for the body scanner. She was rude, short with her answers and not very helpful. I'm not sure if it's standard for only men to go through the body scanner, but that's what happened. The woman we passed on to go through the metal detectors and the men formed a line to go through the scanner. I live as a Transgender individual so security check points are usually the most stressful part of flying. I entered  the body scanner, put my hands up as I was told. Waited for direction from the agent standing on the outside of the scanner. Only to hear the woman who was separating the line say ""Dude pull up your pants so they aren't hanging off your butt."" Now mind you, I don't sag my jeans, I wear jeans that fit with a belt. That belt I had to take off before entering the scanner. So I did my best to follow her instructions, while listening to the guy on the other side say. ""Face forward and put your arms up please."" So following 2 sets of requests at the same time is a little difficult. I mean if anyone else can pull up their pants, while placing their hands above their head at the same time, please let me know your secret. After leaving security, I visited one of the smaller restaurant and enjoyed a good burger that wasn't to bad in price. I visited a gift shop and found it annoying to pay $2.85 for a bottle of soda, but that is to be expected when traveling I guess. While waiting for my plane, the lady working the gate door began to speak and make overhead announcements, none of which anyone could hear. She did her best to repeat herself but in the end she was forced to stand on a chair and yell to the 150+ people waiting to board the airplane. We heard he loud and clear at that point lol.

After being gone for 4 days and returning home. Arrival to the airport was good, the baggage claim was easy to navigate and the bags showed up fairly quickly. I was due to catch a shuttle back to Tucson. I asked the guy at the information desk where I needed to be to catch my shuttle. He told me ""you want to exit through door 2, go across the street and it will pick you up there."" So I did. 15 mins. later, and now 5 mins. after my shuttle was scheduled to arrive, I was still there. So I asked another guy wearing a vest if I was in the right place. He said ""oh no you are suppose to be on the other side,"" he directed me to go back through baggage claim and exit through door 6 to find my shuttle. I got to the door and same thing happened. So while standing outside the door and rather upset at this point. I called the shuttle company, told them my issue, only to find out my shuttle had already left, and I was considered a ""no show"" because I was sent to the wrong place all together. I was suppose to be at door 8. Thankfully the shuttle hadn't completely left the airport yet, and the driver was dispatched to swing back around and pick up me before leaving. I was more thankful to the shuttle company and their willingness to help me out rather than the airport staff. 

So overall my experience fell short due to the staff more than anything else. I will use the airport again in the future I am sure. It's not nearly as bad as the Denver airport, but it wasn't good either.",0,0,0

SITREP

I did NOT want to be here.  I kept wondering, ""Where is Mr. Rogers?  This is NOT my neighborhood!!!""

THE SETUP

I was on a Spokane to Sacramento trip...BY WAY OF FUC'n PHOENIX!  ""Way to add 5 hours to a 2 hour flight, SouthWest!""  But it's kinda hard to blame the lovely Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport that turn of events.

[And in the end, it was even hard to get angry at SouthWest since they DID have the courtesy to take us right smack over the top of the Grand Canyon - a sight I'd never seen before - so THAT in itself was an ironic treat.  ""Hey Mom!  Yeah, I know I was going to Sacramento, BUT guess what?  I saw the Grand Canyon too!""  Now THAT doesn't happen every day.]

AIRPORT METRICS

Sky Harbor is such a beautiful, large airport, with lots of different terminals, lots of different automatic walkways, and - get this - LOTS of Laptop Bar & Stool set-ups.  During my 2 1\/2 hour layover, where I also switched planes, I got to charge my laptop, my camera, my iPhone, and my external battery charger:  I was set!

WIFI

Free!  That's all I need to say!  I was able to connect quickly and upload all of those pictures I had just taken of the grand canyon to Flickr, Yelp and Facebook.  I also did some blogging to boot.

IN SUM

I have no idea what the traffic was like to get to the airport... since I landed there.

I have no idea what the parking situation was like at the airport... since I landed there.

I have no idea what the TSA Checkpoint situation is like at this airport since....yeah, you guessed it, I LANDED there.

But you know what?  As a guest of the airport who galavorted from one terminal to another terminal as a transfer to catch my next flight, it was not a bad deal.

Just yesterday we were picked up, and rather that drive to the parking lot next to the terminal, West economy where we were parked, they drove past the entrance to West economy parking and away towards the next terminal; since it was going to take 20 minutes to loop around to our stop or longer, we got off and walked to the car. So if your trip is over, hop on the tram, enjoy the A\/C and relax until your at your row in parking. If I were alone I would have stayed put.
There are times when I have 9am flights that the security is consistently at it's slowest going to California, to the point where I'm at a panic. However, since I know that's about a 30% likely and I've never missed a flight it's a minor gripe  in an overall successful process. I always get to the airport an hour early, so take that in mind if you don't. There have been 2-3 times at TSA where we are all in a panic wondering if we can remain civil to the process any longer. I don't know how many times the TSA end of the line steward will yell out, to go to another terminal C TSA for NO waiting. Man, if those employees aren't busy then move them over here!
The post TSA food choices are OK, nothing that exciting;  Wendy's, Subway and Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf. Since i'm usually taking morning flights I'll always grab something from Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf as my post TSA survival treat. The airport and parking is always clean and the staff have always been very courteous and professional.",2,0,0

The new SkyTrain is conveniently located outside the 44th street light rail station and the east economy parking lot. You can also take Uber to and from Sky Harbor. The SkyTrain goes to terminal 3 & 4 and I guess making its way to the Rental car center by 2019! Its a mix of modern and old inside the terminals, but the dining options are getting better with each passing year. The TSA is down-to-earth friendly, almost like a twilight zone compared to other orderly and zombie like characters i've seen at other airports. I got complemented on my necklace and bracelets during check in, and the friendly TSA agent made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. Oh yeah...most restaurants are of local ""Phoenix"" flavor and many have home-grown roots somewhere else in the city. I definitely love coming here, and think its a notch above most U.S. Airports!

Get in the wrong lane and you'll end up in the parking garage, when all you wanted was to drop off someone at the Departures curb. 

Terminal 2 remains the most accessible, with a parking lot located across the street and few airlines stationed there. Because only a couple airlines now use this terminal, security is a breeze. However, it's the oldest terminal, smells bad (like rotten pizza) and doesn't appear clean. 

Terminal 3 a little more of a hassle, although they have a parking garage attached to the terminal allowing you to enter any level through the elevator. More airlines use this terminal and it's much smaller than Terminal 4, making it easier to navigate.

The staff were mainly all terrible and made my red-eye layover here that much more miserable. I ate at Sauce (separate review to come), but there were a lot of other dining options as well. They have shops, too, ranging from diamonds to touristy souvenirs to flying necessities, like those little neck pillows, which I ended up dearly regretting not thinking to purchase until after that store was closed for the night.

I had a four hour layover here before my flight went back to DC at 11pm (which is 2am for my internal east coast clock.)

But back to the staff. I haven't flown much, but I've got the basic process down since it's pretty simple. I was near my gate all situated when suddenly they... close it for the night? I haven't had this happen and was completely clueless as to what to do next. I asked a random staff member, who aside from being useless also seemed pretty high. He said to go through security for the wrong batch of gates and then gave wonderfully vague, completely inactionable instructions on finding my way back to my gate by going a different way. Cool thanks.

So I get up to the security check-in lady for NOT my gate and ask her which way I need to go to get back to my actual gate. ""Straight back, a left and a left"" was her answer (which, again, was wildly useless\/wrong and I ended up having to figure it out myself by following signs that essentially took me on a half hour trip all around to the other side of the ""sky bridge"" or whatever they called it.) 

Anyway, I was exhausted, stressed and her attitude was bitchy as hell. I didn't have my ID out when I got up to her, so she loudly announced to everyone in line behind me, ""HAVE YOUR IDs OUT, EVERYONE,"" as if she was trying to embarrass me. I rolled my eyes quite visibly and then headed away in the wrong direction because I was delirious from exhaustion and still super confused as to what I was supposed to be doing since I wasn't even at the correct place. ""Where are you going? Everyone else is clearly going that way,"" she spat at me, implying I was stupid.

Ok, listen. I get that you're paid a pretty low hourly wage, and the only sense of power you have is to feign fake authority over others. But seriously, have a seat with that attitude. Part of what you get paid to do is interact pleasantly with airline customers. I'm obviously exhausted, confused and it was probably quite apparent that I haven't flown much, so how about just reflect well upon your employer by behaving like a decent human being? I would normally have flipped on her, but lucky for her, I didn't have the energy left in my reserves.

So once I finally made it back, somehow, to the other not closed area to my gate, I sat down and tried to charge my phone at the little waiting area. Literally 3-4 out of probably 30 outlets even worked. It was a joke. I let a staff member know and his reply was ""Yeah, we forgot to pay the power bill."" Oh, so you're a funny guy. I see. He did then probably realize he was being a d*ck and redeemed himself by saying the outlets at one particular table seemed to be working.

Also, at some point on my way back from the bathroom, a staff member alerted me not to step in the pools of blood that were all over the floor. Couldn't tell for sure, but it looked like a ""someone got punched in the face or possibly worse"" amount of blood. It wasn't like someone got a cut or something. Pleasant.

Here's me waxing nostalgic, as well as dating myself:

In high school, we used to drive to the airport and play Pictionary in the terminals.  Like, cross-legged sitting on the carpet in the middle of the airport.  Or, we would run around the airport playing hide-and-seek, or tag.  Those were the days of the Old Republic, when everything wasn't so paranoid and regulated.

Today, the airport is mostly remodeled inside.  There's decent food and a little too much shopping.  It looks nice though; they spared no expense.

My favorite thing is in the terminals, there are birdhouses high up in the rafters, and little finches living in the airport.  All these little birds flying around in the terminal...it was almost surreal.

All in all, a good travel experience.",0,1,1

The airport is pretty large, clean and modern-looking.  My favorite thing about the airport is the rental car facility.  Like other airports such as McCarran, they have a huge car rental facility away from the terminals, so far that you have to catch a shuttle.  Shuttle buses constantly make stops right outside of baggage claim to bring you to the huge car rental area.  The facility is huge and so convenient because all of the rental car companies are under one roof, unlike Honolulu where you have to look and wait for a certain company's bus and catch that particular shuttle to their office because every single rental car company has a different lot.     

One minor mishap and one major mishap made my visit really memorable.  The minor thing that happened was that while waiting for our baggage at baggage claim, the luggage got stuck at the top of the ""slide"" where they come down to the conveyor belt.  It wasn't a big deal because an awesome Hawaiian Airlines (go HA!) employee went in to unclog the luggage.  Problem solved, we didn't wait too long for our luggage.

The major mishap and our ""welcome"" to Phoenix was when we arrive to the car rental facility, there was a huge fight that just broke out on the sidewalk.  Security got there quickly to break it up and called the police.  Our shuttle driver who was obviously concerned for our safety didn't open the bus doors until the fight broke up and the security got there.  I have no idea where in the world those people were from but boy do they know how to welcome people to Phoenix!  

Other than the holdup at baggage claim and the fight right outside of the rental car facility, my short visit to PHX was great.  I have no complaints about the facility and found it easy to navigate around the huge airport.  I hope when I return next year, my visit is less eventful.",29,25,26

*** BUSINESS TRAVELER Viewpoint. ***

It's getting better but other airports are getting better faster!

Yes the Wi-Fi is free but it's spotty and often slow.  Nowadays there is no excuse for crappy Wi-Fi in a major airport.

Yes power outlet availability is getting better but it's a long way from where it needs to be. If I was in charge I would write a power outlet clause into the contract of every new or renewing restaurant\/bar.  Nobody should need to sit on the floor to grab power!

Yes there are many more restaurants and eateries but their location is odd.  If you don't like what's immediately near you it can be a long long way to the next group of them.

I do appreciate their heavy use of moving walkways. When you are a tired business traveler schlepping between terminals they are much appreciated.

The luggage pickup carousels use large, color, flat TVs that display flight info and even, the weather!  Although, the only options you'll see are: Hot, Daym Hot, and Even Hell Would Be Jealous. 

The car rental facility is off site.  However, there are plenty of shuttle buses so you hardly have to wait at all for a ride.  The shuttle bus pickup point is outside the main entrance on the ground floor but you do have to cross the street to get there.

If you get confused or lost, they have customer service greeters at key areas who are more than happy to offer directions or help.

The shuttle bus ride to the car rental center took about 8-10 minutes.  It's one of the largest and most modern car rental centers I've seen.  It looks fairly new and well organized.  It has its own bathrooms and you can even check in your luggage, if it's at least 90min before your flight and only available for certain airlines.  That's a very nice, convenient service.

Lately there has been a ton of construction that makes it impossible to get around and the signs for where the terminals are located just dont work. If your looking for which one of the 4 terminals your plane is leaving from you better know before you get there because your not going to find a sign that tells you. Luckily i know the airport well but its just a terrible system. THough they are now doing some construction to try and fix things (I hope).

Parking is a mess with the spiral parking garages and getting in. The one nice thing is the cell phone waiting lots that are actually really useful and pretty accommodating for a large airport. Parking cheap is just a good distance away on washington and is worth it if you have the time and AAA discounts. 

Inside the airport needs updating but is still better than many of the other airport in the country. Overall the inside is one of the best part of the airport with a good amount of places to eat and drink and alright walking between the different gates. Overall Sky harbor is a low level to middle of the pack airport that is going through some hopefully necessary upgrades but a mess otherwise especially for out of town people.",1,0,0

It is centrally located and I would rate it high in the convience department. After that, it's downhill. I don't park there -  I use a shuttle service such as the Parking Spot and get dropped off right out front. Much easier. Inside the terminals are good, most of the times the lines move, although why people cannot figure out how to use the self check kiosks, I don't know. It isn't rocket science. Security lines are rarely long and move quickly, but once inside you are stuck with limited services. Sure there are stores and Dick Clark's on the outside, but be prepared to fly hungry or wait in long lines on the inside. I fly Delta a lot and in terminal 3 you have a choice of Wendy's or the blue burrito...or vending machines...maybe pick up something at the newsstand...

For me the major issues are driving through the airport. The terminals are not user friendly. They are adequately marked 1-4 and have north side and south side. When picking up someone ask which door number they are coming out of - because you cannot stop long. Once the wheels on the bus stop going round and round security emerges as if by magic to instruct you to keep moving. Sit there and ignore them long enough and the ticket book appears - that's when it;s time to circle again (thanks, Bin Laden). Terminal three has one inconvenient turn while you are waiting for emerging traffic during your continual loop of the terminal - I have almost been t-boned a few times there. Another thing I don't like is their short term parking - it appears instantly and goes up a ramp. It is always in a spot I am not thinking it should be, so I miss it. Instead use the cell phone lot and wait for your party to call, circle around and take your chances with security.

On a positive note, the airport is a great place to people watch. I always follow the guideline of 2 hours early, so I get to sit and watch. People hanging in the bar getting drunk and forgetting they are flying when their name is paged, people late and OJ'ing it through the concourse, people wearing interesting outfits and being an international airport, you can see people from all over the world. Not to mention the occassional disruptions - is it a wonder SouthWest made a reality show about people in the airport? If you don't mind being hungry and bored, arrive early and watch the people.

The concourses are half as long as the separation between them so it means you have 8 or so concourses with only 14 or so gates and a VERY LONG distance between them. To make matters worse the moving walkways are often out of commission. I'm fit but it's a challenge to get from A20 to B20 in under 15 minutes, so forget grabbing food if you have a 45 minute layover as you'll be boarding straight away. 

There's great food offerings - especially Four Peaks Brewery- but you can't make it to them if you're in the wrong concourse. There's zero in the connecting arms but the moving sidewalk when these could host more food and services. 

Why doesn't PHX take a tip from IAH or SFO who have upgraded and updated layouts to fit the modern travel experience. PHX seems locked in the 1980s and its America West heyday.

Also, there was no way for me to find a way to another terminal. There are no information booths and if there was then it was well hidden from me. I finally asked a TSA security guy if he could help me find my flight. He told me I'd have to take a shuttle to another terminal. I was surprised that in 2012 this airport that seems so modern did not have a train that connected all of the terminals.

I frown on airports not allowing ride sharing services, and PHX is definitely not one of them.  Their signs could be improved pointing passengers where the pickup points are, so half a star deduction there.  Not many recharging areas either, so another half a star.

PHX is okay as an airport. Once you've been through departing a few times, you learn the terminal layout and parking options.  But on first experience, it's a befuddled mess.  Knowing the parking layout isn't easy. Numbering system is inconsistent. And you see people struggling to tell their ride where to pick them up on a regular basis in baggage claim. At-airport parking is also very expensive at $25\/day.  

To its credit, PHX does have some good eating options.  Better than almost all other airports even.

Other than that, it's a messy design, the place is showing age, and you have to budget extra time in case there is traffic.  Guess that's the price of having a downtown airport.  I'd love to see them build a modern international airport in Buckeye.  They have enough land out there and (with the new loop) it would balance out some of the traffic load so the highway around the airport isn't so congested.

Better bet is to park in the Spot parking at E 40th and Van Buren.  There is a covered option and they zip you right in.",0,0,0

Their slogan is ""America's Friendliest Airport"", not sure how that is determined, but I cannot completely disagree.
If flying US Airways out of terminal 4, it's even more convenient.

I typically park for a day or 2 while I travel, they have the economy east lot either $9 daily uncovered or $11 daily for covered. There is a convenient air train that stops at terminal 4 and leaves every 5 minutes or so. The air train doesn't stop by the checkin counters so you'll have to walk a bit if you need to check any bags. If you're traveling from other terminals, you will have to take an additional - bus - to get to the next terminal. For example, I flew Delta and had to take a inner airport shuttle to terminal 3. These shuttle busses arrive every few minutes but it's still a slight hassle running around.

Food options at PHX are pretty decent, especially being gluten free. Each terminal and area have different options but always something for any taste.

Or perhaps, the flight times just aren't staggered appropriately. Depending on the minute you walk through the terminal, it can feel like trying to make your way through a crowded bar or it can feel like an empty mall. Similarly, restaurants go from being completely packed to empty and quiet in the span of 15 minutes. This airport is the definition of YMMV! 

Walking from one gate to another quickly turns into a hike - even with the moving walkways. This would not be a fun airport to have a tight connection. 

On the plus side, there are plenty of food and shopping options, along with 3 different Admirals Clubs. So it's pretty good for long connections.

...all of the above being said, avoid PHX in the summer. When it's too hot, flights will be grounded and you may get stuck here much longer than expected. That's particularly true if you're on a codeshare with a smaller airline based out of Phoenix. Think twice before booking!",1,1,1

The food options in this terminal are bunk and there is not a whole lot of seating. Its home to Alaska Airlines, United, Spirit and a couple others.

Terminal 4 is the main vein of the airport and provides access to the sky train and parking.

Conveniently Starbucks is right off each security line, before and after so no issues there. Each wing of the terminal has its own small little food court w\/ a few options. The thing is, if you're not sure what you want to eat you have to scope out each wing of Terminal 4 or find a map. Security in this terminal though moves quick. The staff is always helpful and friendly. The restroom lines are never long. The airport does allow dogs to be out of their carriers as long as they're on a leash. All terminals are always super clean. The Sky Train is easily accessible from Terminal 4 which takes you right to long term parking and the light rail station. The Sky Train is free which is great for travelers on a budget, in a hurry, or just super jet lagged. 

The pick up situation is kind of a pain. Baggage claim is a little whacky. The airport is a giant oval and if you miss your terminal exit for departures or arrivals you have to loop alllllll the way around and circle back.

If you're in the mood for grazing, don't expect to find much in the way of food beyond gut-busting, lard-laden junk. To prevent the spread of bovine diseases, make sure to avoid touching surfaces and use plenty of soap and sanitizer when using the facilities. Moo.

If you're connecting on a flight that leaves out of another terminal, good luck. You'll have to leave your current terminal and go through security again at another terminal miles away. Need to get to your rental car fast? Fat chance. The shuttle ride to the rental car center takes you halfway to the Grand Canyon.

When people talk about Sky Harbor, they mostly mean terminals 3 and 4. 2 is primarily international. 

4 is the newer of the terminals. 3 is older, but still not bad. Southwest and US Airways use Terminal 4, both of which are popular airlines in AZ.

Either of them are pretty good compared to many other cities. Especially terminal 4 which is crowded but plush by airport standards.

Free wifi. Plenty of AC power plugs for laptops and other devices. Lots of dining options - both behind and in front of the security checkpoint. Clean and plentiful bathrooms. 

Sometimes the security line is long. Sometimes it isn't. It isn't the airports fault - they are all manned by the same idiot TSA employees, no matter the airport. The airport doesn't hire these mouth breathers, only the Federal Government is capable of hiring incompetents on such a massive scale. :) And they hire the false security guards for every airport.

I mean that in and of itself is great.  There is nothing more I hate than paying $5 or even $10 to feed my internet addiction for an hour or so.

I never seem to have the problems that others have with this airport....my luggage doesn't take forever to hit the carousel (although I have picked up friends and relatives here and have had that happen....), security is a breeze (granted, I'm usually taking the red eye or the first flight out but such is the case when you fly to the East Coast), and as I sit here at 10:50 there is a full bar open still serving food and drink...and they will be open until 12.

If you think the gates here are far apart or its too big then don't ever fly into Newark, JFK, or LGA.  I once had to walk over a mile next to the runway to get to the stupid Marine Air Terminal.  This airport only has three terminals which are pretty small in comparison to other cities.  You could walk for days in Houston to get to your gate.  

Parking here is cheap in comparison to the airports back East.  Just a few bucks for an hour or so.  My mom and uncle picked us up at Newark in December and for 45 minutes it cost nearly $10!  I know that JFK and LGA would be similar, not to mention the cost of the bridges and tolls getting to those airports.  Getting to Sky Harbor is always a breeze for me.

And I guarantee you that you will never have a snow delay or cancellation or wait to have them de-ice your plane.

My only issue: why ya gotta close the snack stations so early? Sure, conveniently land me at the gate I'm supposed to take back off again from but it's also next to Pizza Hut, Nathan's and a BAR....all of which are closed before 10am.

Because of the good weather and the manageable planes arriving\/departing, I have not experienced much delays here, which makes Phoenix a good option to connect to the East Coast.

Also, if you have a digital boarding pass on your iPhone or Android and go through a *different* gate (they are mostly all connected via runways, etc) due to the line at the gate you're supposed to go through, note that they may not be able to scan your digital boarding pass... this happened to us once when we went to another gate with a significantly shorter line.. luckily they had the kiosk just there so I ran out of line and printed them out while hubby held my spot.

This airport is really spread out, and there aren't any navigation maps around to tell you the quickest path from one terminal to another. They have the nice little conveyor belts to move you along more quickly if you're in a hurry, but I bet they would be more efficient if 3\/4 of them weren't broken down when I was there.

The restaurant selection and stores are so-so at best, and if you find one you like you better eat at it now, because who knows if there is another one in the airport? You'd most likely have to go on a 30 minute hike to find out if there's one closer to your terminal before realizing there isn't and you're forced to eat at someplace else which is more expensive and not as tasty in order to avoid missing your flight.

The good thing about this place though is that everyone I met who worked there was incredibly friendly. One employee even got me on an earlier flight since I was sitting at my gate in the terminal and she clued me in that there were 30 open seats on a flight to my destination that was currently boarding if I wanted to go hop on.

The restaurants are pretty slim pickings inside security at Phoenix.  My boss needed a pair of sunglasses since she forgot hers.  There was no place to buy sunglasses inside security.

I love Sky Harbor International.  I'm glad this my hometown's airport because it's great.  Constantly renovating and revamping itself, this place has more than your typical vanilla restaurant.  We're talking quality eats [specifically if you're coming out of Terminal 4] from well-known and well-loved places around town.  The bathrooms are always clean, TSA and airline staffs are always friendly, and they have moving walkways to help get your booty around.  Free WiFi is offered, they have a multitude of charging stations [although I carry an external battery charger because I ain't gonna sit by a bunch of antisocial people], and all your pet parks and rental cars are situated nearby.  They do have a bit of a confusing north and south curb for arrivals and departures that can be a bit tricky but if you can read the signs, you're good.  They even have a cell phone lot nearby for those who are waiting to pick up loved ones because no parking at the curb!  That's the only time you might run into a sardonic and ornery TSA agent.  Security checkpoint lines move fast.  It's great!

I like that there is a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf (I like CBTL better than Starbucks).  The restrooms need cleaning (it was dirty and smelly at arrival and departure days).  I give it between a strong 3-star and a weak 4-star.  

However, the Phoenix Sky Harbor TSA agents need better training.  

I owned a Victorinox Jetsetter bladeless multi-tool because of the convenience of having a small multi-tool at all times. I use the scissors to cut paper, tags, plastic wraps, etc. It has some useful tools: a magnetic phillips screwdriver tip, cap lifter\/bottle opener and wire stipper.
It also has a small scissors, key ring, tweezers and toothpick.  When I fly, I usually keep this in my carry-on and I have had no issues flying over the past few years.  Many TSA agents in other airports were surprised by a multi-tool not having a blade. I've flown through SFO, OAK, EWR, DCA, ORD, LAX, SEA and many other airports without any problems. Until I flew out of Phoenix Sky Harbor.  

This blade-less multi-tool was confiscated by TSA from my carry-on bag on a recent flight out of Phoenix Sky Harbor.  I was lectured by the agents that TSA no longer allows Swiss Army knives past screening since 2013. I knew that, and that is why I got this Jetsetter, which has no blade. The TSA agents I dealt with at Phoenix Sky Harbor airport somehow could not grock the idea of a swiss army knife with no knife.  I explained that it does not have a blade, but they did not believe me (or did not care to). I asked them to open the accessories, but they would not.  They added that scissors are not allowed, but I know that scissors less than 4 inches from the fulcrum are allowed (like this Jetsetter), as per TSA website. This whole time, I was jovial and friendly with the agents, and not once did I raise my voice or seem frustrated.

Finally I asked them if I can show them, and they reacted as if I was a threat. They said I had to either voluntarily surrender this utility tool, or I can go back to the check-in desk and check in this knife in a bag (and pay a checked bag fee of $35). So I told the guy to keep it as an early Christmas present from me, but they did not appreciate the comment. Their response was that these are discarded or thrown away, and not kept for possession or auction (b.s.).

I have another Jetsetter so I am complete again. To save from future headache, I will not carry this on my carry-on and just check it in. I still don't get it, but I suppose it all depends on the airport and TSA agents. Hopefully it is merely a one-time thing.

I also noticed a man with DS at a special screening\/pat down.  He went through the metal detector (no issues that I can see or hear).  Then they made him go through the body scanner.  Then he had to got through a wipe test (for explosives, incendiaries, gun powder).  Then he went through a hand wand scan.  Finally he had a personal pat down.  He was in good spirits the whole time; he actually seemed to enjoy the attention.  When I asked why all the extra security precautions, I was told that it was random.  Random?!  I spent the next 45 minutes near the gate to watch any other ""random"" special searches and I saw none.

I pay extra for TSA pre-check in as I'm trying to get through terminal D it takes more time through the pre-check line then it does to the regular line. TSA is totally understaffed.  The guy who is observing the x-ray machine is also assisting doing bag inspections and body checks so every time he finds something on the x-ray machine the belt has to stop and then he moves to the other areas to then do a back inspection which happens frequently. The lines were backed up customers were frustrated and disgruntled but they did not care. The regular line moved faster than the pre-check line. Get through the terminal and there's lines for the men's bathroom. Very poor infrastructure at this airport glad I'm not living here and getting back home I would hate to use this as My regular airport.  Important to note is that an airport is your first and your last impression of a city so I would recommend that the city of Phoenix work on this experience so people may actually want to return.,0,0,0

All of the rentals are located in single monstrous building that you reach by shuttle bus. The shuttles are efficient and the drivers are helpful. So what's wrong? 

Well YOU have to pay for all of this. I just surveyed a bunch of car companies to get rental rates. Here's what it looks like for a ""standard"" car (all about the same size):

Company  Weekly Rate Fees & Taxes Total cost Fee  Multiple
Alamo        $87               $85                 $172         49%    1.98

I'm sure that you'll find a whole bunch of different rates, but you're still going to have pay the 'airport fee', the state tax, the city tax, and the assorted charges the car rental companies add on to pay their costs for charging you. (Of course, the only way you are going to get even these rates is to absolutely refuse all of the other add-ons that you will be offered.) 

You can probably avoid the airport related taxes and fees by renting from a downtown location. Taxis from the airport to downtown are fast, efficient and very reasonable.

Right now, the Phoenix airport is more of a 2 star airport, but it is undergoing a lot of renovations so I applaud the effort.  Sky Harbor International has an incredibly long way to go before it can be considered in the same class as some of the nicer international airports, let alone inside the U.S.  The terminals feel drab and dingy.  The old Southwestern-patterned carpets don't help, though there are eye-pleasing murals decorating the walls of some concourses.  Relatively low ceilings and limited window views of the outside coupled with dense passenger traffic can make some sections of this airport feel downright claustrophobic.

Seriously though, entering this airport feels like taking a step back in time.  Remember the retro Taco Time theme of brown and burnt orange?  That's what Sky Harbor feels like.  Speaking of food, the restaurant selection here is abysmal.  Fortunately, the aforementioned renovations include the addition of several new eateries including local concepts.  There's currently a lot of on-going construction.

At least the future is bright for Phoenicians.

The food sucks.  One time before a flight I had a teriyaki chicken bowl at one of the generic restaurants (I decided this would be one of the most healthy options aside from Quiznos--too many delicious dipping sauces...).  I must not have been thinking about the effects of eating a dish with an astronomical amount of sodium, because my feet swelled so much that I had to remove my shoes during the flight.  Lovely.  

Parking is a nightmare.  There is no logic the parking garage.  It corkscrews you up and you're suddenly on level 6, without a hint as to the location of the terminal's entrance.  When I flew back home from my trip, I went out to the parking garage to find my car, only to realize that I was in the wrong terminal.  If you're flying on different airlines in and out of Sky Harbor, make note of the terminal where your car is parked!  

One must take a shuttle between terminals to get between them.  Never fun after a day of traveling.

I thought it would be relatively painless to simply pick someone up or drop them off here.  What a nightmare.  Especially when you have to reach terminal 2.  

Beware: terminal 2 has no clearly marked signs for passenger drop off.  I had to circle around and almost ended up back on the 202, all while dodging the rude taxi and shuttle drivers that LOVE to cut me off.  Disastrous when your precious cargo is about to miss their flight.    

The signs to get back on the 202 aren't very clear either.  I need arrows.  I need signs that say ""left lane 202 E""  or ""right lane 202 W"" (disclaimer:  I have no clue if the right or left lane take you east or west).  How in the world they twist you around each side of every terminal and loop you through to the highway, I have no clue.

Leaving Phoenix is hard enough, but when the lines to check your baggage seem endless and confusing - you just want to turn around and go back to the resort. 

From what I saw of this airport, it's typical - nothing really to write home about. Basic food and drinks - basic gifts and such, but then - you hit this incredible line. This time it was on the Southwest side!

Luckily there was someone who knew the routine and guided me to the correct long line. Once to the kiosk, a quick scan of my boarding pass had things moving right along. However, the movement was slow once my bags were tagged, because they couldn't put them on the belt - I needed to take them to a holding area - 6 bags checked - 2 arrived in Buffalo.

I have been told it was TSA's security conveyor belts that caused the problem - instead of 4 running they were down to 1. I'm not sure who's issue it was, but it became mine as soon as my bags on a nonstop flight didn't arrive at my destination with me.

TSA stands for Transportation Security Administration, but I like to refer to it as Terrible Service A-holes! I'm not sure how one is selected to work for the TSA, but I don't think it takes much - at least not for some of the positions. 

Depending on what gate you are departing from - here are some tips:
1) Starbucks is right after security - get it there
2) Food - eat before you pass security as selections are slim after that
3) Don't check your bags if you want them at your final destination with you
4) Don't expect much from TSA
5) Don't argue with anyone in the airport
6) Drive whenever possible

Second time around was a little different. Got to experience the non-security portion and was actually able to select from a few different eating places to eat with someone that was not flying out.

One huge line that winds around and around rather than being broken up into different sections. Made the wait feel like forever...and it's really stuffy feeling. Also, security here is mega over the top when it comes to carry on.

Thankfully, PHX is well air conditioned once inside the terminal. Concourse D was very nice and seemed new. There was plenty of seating and a good view of the airfield at the end of the concourse. There were a couple shops and a couple of restaurants as well.

The connection between the concourses was a different story. They're kind of old and drab. There are good views of the planes but the connectors are very long. There are moving walkways so the walk isn't so bad, but some were out of order whenever I was here. They had several staff on carts taking people back and forth from gates, which helped tons of people out. Both wings of Concourse C were similar to Concourse D, except with less options and was less open. I found the terminal to be very crowded but there was still plenty of seating.

The American side is similar to the Southwest side. Very hot and crowded. There are tons of eating options. Not so good views since it is on the wrong side of the airport for that. Had some good views of downtown. Was still hot despite air conditioning due to the amount of people passing through.

Unlike most, they offer free wi-fi  and the signal actual works. That's pretty friendly to travelers, I guess.

Otherwise, it's a pretty average airport but not laid out very well - there are long walks between concourses making it hard to transfer if you have a short layover. Once in the concourse, the gates are crammed together meaning seating is in short supply and bathrooms are crowded.

On the plus side, the airport is fairly close to Downtown and Scottsdale. On the minus side, they charge absolutely exorbitant taxes on rental cars (even by airport standards).",3,1,1

I remember it like it was yesterday. I sat at PHX for over 8 hours while I waited for my flight to ABQ, and then drove close to 3 hours to Gallup, New Mexico. Imagine my frustration when I realized, had I consulted a map, I could have driven to Gallup in much less time, thereby avoiding several hours of airport appreciation. PHX, I've purposely avoided you for 15 years because of this, but today was a day to let bygones be bygones.

I needed to get somewhere, and the connection that made the most sense was through Phoenix. I flew in and had about an hour to walk around while I waited on my next flight, and made peace with the airport. 

First, it's been remodeled. Yeah, I know what your thinking, and you're right. It has been 15 years since I was here last and I would hope they would have done something since then. They have, and I was pleased. I also liked the carpet.. If you look close enough, there are little airplanes in the design. Subtle, but if you stare at the floor when your walking like I do, you'll notice it. 

I didn't see a Starbucks, which I desperately needed after catching a 6am flight from the eastern time zone, so I settled for a diet coke and found a comfortable seat to watch CNN from while I waited on my flight. Most of the restaurants I came across seemed to be local or regional places; I didn't recognize too many of the names, and they all seemed to have something to do with Mexican food. I really could have used a Starbucks. 

America West no longer exists, we aren't preparing for certain doom like we were in 1999 before the new millennium, and I didn't check any bags.

I've used the time to develop an airport rating system mostly compatible with Yelps five star reviews.  So on a scale of one to five stars, with five being A PALACE, ""I'd rather spend time here than at home,"" and one being THE PIT OF DESPAIR (say it in the albino's voice for greatest effect) Phoenix's Sky harbor rates a decent 3.5.

Sky harbor is on the small side of large airports and as such one expects a certain degree of difficulty getting to it and finding parking, one accepts this difficulty and plans accordingly (or one doesn't and misses one's flight).  Phoenix is no more or less agonizing than any big airport in terms of getting there.

The external waiting areas (before security check points) are nice, there are comfy chairs with convenient charging stations throughout and a good selection of shops and restaurants (even a flight museum).  Shy Harbor offers free wireless, the only price you pay is nervous exhaustion waiting for the achingly slow connection.

Security can be a bit of an ordeal.  The scanners appear to be some sort of already outdated beta test version that take seven seconds to violate your privacy rights instead of the more usual three seconds.   Upon exiting the scanner there are no seats for passengers to sit on while they gather up their belongings and put their shoes back on.  One small bench does exist, but as of the writing of this review it was hidden behind some temporary walls and a desk.  Lack of seating means people tend to clog up the exit side of security trying to snatch up their things and put themselves back together before moving out of the way of others.   The high point of today's trip through security was Mr. Grumpypants, one of the rudest TSA agents I have encountered in awhile, haranguing the senior citizens for leaving their paper tickets in their pockets.

The open, modern terminals are clean, clearly marked, and fairly easily navigated.  There are no trams and surprisingly few moving walkways for a town full of retirees (I leave it to you to decide if that is a plus or a minus).   Once at the gate I found that there were wall outlets available but they were located about five feet up the walls and not always next to any seating.  Not exactly convenient, but at least available.  there are a small assortment of shops and restaurants in the terminals but the good stuff is all back past security.",2,1,0

I arrived at an A gate connecting at a B gate not hard right? Wrong I ran (which I try never to do) and could not make it.  The gates are too far a part if you are cutting it close.  It took me 10 minutes to run from one concourse to the other lugging a carry-on behind me.

I can't tell you how many times I've seen a sea of Sbarro's\/McDonald's\/Starbucks and other chains as my only options. 

+It's near the center of the city. Most airports are at least a half hour drive outside of any significant neighborhood. That means when your destination is Phoenix, it's very easy to get around. There are even very affordable shuttle services to take you to Flagstaff\/Tucson. 

+No matter where your gate is, you will have adequate seating, places to charge your phone, and places to shop.

We fly in from San Francisco and are told that we will have to go to another building via a bus. We get off the plane and walk...and walk...and then walk some more, looking around trying to find where to go to in order to catch this bus. Finally, we found someone who told us where to go. We walked and walked, and then walked some more until we finally caught the bus. We then had to find the correct gate and go through security again... 

Flash forward 8 days. We fly in and go through customs. (This, BTW, was a great experience because we were the only international flight going through customs.) We rechecked our luggage and are told that we have to go to another building. Yep, you know what I am about to say...we floundered around, having to ask where to go several times. Finally, we found the right place and got on the bus. It then proceeded to go to various parking lots, dropping off and picking up other passengers. My husband and I looked at each other, worried that we were on the wrong bus. Since it was already 4 p.m. and we had not had lunch, we were getting very worried that we would not have time to grab lunch. 

Finally, my husband asked the driver and he indicated that we were indeed on the right bus. We continued going around parking lots until we came upon another bus. The driver told everyone on our bus that we could sit around and wait for 10-15 minutes, or we could get on the next bus and get there quicker. Of course, we all grabbed our suitcases and boarded the next bus, which proceeded to take us to the correct stop (after picking up additional passengers along the way.) 

Next ,we entered the terminal and jumped on an elevator to take us to the security line. There were only 2 lines and of course, we got in the line with the family who had to go back 6 or 7 times because they kept trying to go through the security line with belts on, shoes on, liquids in  their suitcases...you get the picture!

That is a lot of time spent sitting on seats, waiting to stand in line to sit in another seat. 

At any rate, I don't really think I could rate any airport more than 3 stars, but there are some that would be hard pressed to get 2 stars. 

I have spent most of my time in terminals 2 and 4 with a mix of United, Southwest, and American (US Airways) airlines, with the occasional Hawaiian, Delta and Air Canada thrown in.

These days, I spend most of my time in Terminal 4, and I think the parking is pretty easy -- the early baggage drop and AirTrain make it simpler for me than even the offsite parking lots that offer shuttle service. The main challenge can be finding a spot in the lot\/garage at busy times -- if you're worried about that, you can always make a reservation at the offsite places that will usually direct you right to an open spot when you arrive. 

Once I depart the AirTrain, it is time for security. Everyone's favorite. I have had good experiences with the TSA Pre lines being open in T4, and I speed through them (once I started traveling a lot, it was TOTALLY worth it to go through the process to get Global Entry, which includes TSA Pre). In T2, I had mixed experiences in past years with the Pre lines being closed and having to go through the ""regular"" lines (I know, the horror!). Seriously, though, the upside is that T2 is much smaller, so the lines were shorter. (plus, the parking is simple in T2 -- I could seriously be in my car within 5 minutes of the plane pulling up to the gate)

The food options in T2 are pretty limited, and I hear they are in T3 as well. T4 has received much love over the past couple of years, and you can find a bunch of local restaurants' branches in the airport now -- it is SO much nicer to grab a sandwich from Wildflower bread, sitting down at Matt's Big Breakfast (if you plan WAY ahead, you can make it happen), or getting coffee at Cartel than having to eat fast food all the time. 

I like the drinking fountains with the water dispensers -- no more awkwardly trying to fill a water bottle from a drinking fountain spout! 

The seats are inconsistent. Some have power, some do not. Some that have plugs do not work or are stretched out (seriously, people, WHAT are you doing to these outlets?!?) and it is tough to find a seat with a cup holder. Yeah, I drink coffee a lot while waiting and usually try to use my laptop to get some work done. I end up with the coffee cup on the ground because I can't hold it while working. However, then I feel like Gollum every time someone walks by dragging their luggage: ""must protect the precious!""

In my experience, the WiFi had been terrible and\/or limited to 30 minutes (that's fun when your flight is delayed 2 hours). I started bringing my own hotspot, but I understand that things are better now. I can't speak on the recent updates except to say that my kids had good experiences using the free wifi from their phones on a recent trip.

There are some issues with the PA systems at the gates. I find it really strange when I can hear the person announcing the flight information from the gate ACROSS THE HALL better than I can hear the person at the gate where I am sitting. (Especially when they're boarding ""Indianapolis"" and ""Minneapolis"" flights at the same time at adjacent gates -- holy cow!)

The updates have opened up the terminal areas (except the gates at the ends of the ""legs""), which is nice and better than other airports that try to cram bars\/restaurants\/shops into every bit available. This airport feels open and spacious -- at least walking around. T4 is not small, but they have those electric carts for people who have to move fast or need assistance, and there are powered walkways for the rest of us. 

Most of my other complaints would have to do with the people who can't seem to listen and follow directions. No, sir, you can't walk through the metal detector with your money clip in your pocket! Those are not the airport's fault as there are people and signs everywhere to remind us. I guess they're just part of the experience. 

Finally, with regard to the staff and volunteers (look for purple), I have had good experiences any time I have needed anything, whether it be from the airline people or the airport-proper employees. The food service people are more hit or miss, but I can imagine how they feel at the end of a shift, so I am willing to cut them a little slack.",2,3,0

Simply flying into and out of the airport isn't as bad as connecting there. And for the initiated it's probably not too bad. But for someone who only flies here once or twice a year, it's a painful experience. It's precision maneuvering to get to the right curb, awkward layout of ticketing, and then a total disconnect in flow from the ticket counter to security.

Once at security, triple check your ticket to make sure you're at the right security gate. Whereas other airports are laid out to have only 1-3 security gates that pretty much lead to any gate, you best pay attention because each security station only serves a handful of gates. I know this isn't a hard thing to do, but it's just another nitpicky step that makes flying here a pain.

Connections are the greatest downfall of this airport. If you're lucky, you may fly in to, say, gate A18 and then connect to gate A22. No big deal. A few months ago I flew into gate A30 and out of gate B20. Doesn't seem like a big deal? They're 47 miles apart. Okay, not really. But it was a loooong walk with only a couple of moving sidewalks thrown in. And don't even try to consider moving between terminal 2, 3, or 4. It would be faster to just walk to your destination city than navigate that mess.

I'm not too picky about my food options, but PHX falls short here too. Yes, it's overpriced, yes it's lousy, but even here there are less options than normal.

What I do like about Sky Harbor is the addition of free wifi. And it's pretty good wifi. Fast and easy to log in. Big plus in that category.

Not sure what else they can do to make things better. Most of the problems are caused by the layout. I don't like to fly here, but sometimes you just have to suck it up and kiss Aunt Beatrice.",4,5,2

The bad:

* Local councilmembers exhorting travelers to shop and dine at the airport. These kind of announcements are totally useless (""Wait, I can eat and shop while I wait for my flight?

You can go through security with an electronic boarding pass on your cell phone no need for printing.

The new body scanners are used. TSA is still figuring out how to optimize the flow of passengers as they use the old and new scanners in parallel.
TSA picks randomly who will go through the new scanner. The bottom line is that you could by-pass the new scanner and jump in front of the people waiting in the new scanner. However you still have to wait for your luggage to go through X-rays. no time saving.

- For some reason, one satellite of Terminal A is close to empty, while the other side is barely navigable. 

- There is absolutely no good food options. All you have to choose from is your typical Burger King-style fast food and other chains that seem like a normal option but turn out to be just as bad and tasteless.

- Everything is just so plain and boring. The walls are a nasty sandy color. The people walking through all have this monotone ""don't bother me"" look on their face, or maybe that's just what flying does to people these days. The carpets have no life in them, and neither do the employees. It's basically one big shithole.

- Toilets are complete crap. If I move for just a slight second, that doesn't mean you have to flush everything down and spray water everywhere. That's just disgusting.

You sure worked hard to make me dislike you.

Let me pre-face this by saying I am a frequent traveler. I've flown through many airports from the East Coast to the W Coast to international destinations. I am no stranger to TSA (and their ever-changing rules) and to all the insanity that accompanies traveling (old people, kids, etc). 

Landing in Phoenix wasn't so bad and I was happy to see that they offered free wifi. 

But flying OUT of Phoenix. Oh boy.

I'm glad I gave myself buffer time as you will definitely need it in this airport. Why, you ask?

OLD People. 

Now before I'm called an age-ist; let's just be honest. Elderly people move slower, get confused easier and tend to not give a f*ck.

Combine all those things with TSA people and what do you get?

Every person in Phoenix apparently didn't know that there was a liquid rule. So people were rolling into check-point with bottles of water in their bags. And TSA, of course, was not being nice about it. 

TSA in Phoenix also decided I was apparently a terrorist as they swabbed me for explosive material. In all my trips to different destinations, I've never had that happen. 

AZ was pretty - the sunshine was beautiful. BUT .. You better comply with the 2+ hour rule because you'll definitely need it. There's nothing worse than having the elderly person ask ""Do I need to take my belt off? Or shoes?""

First of all, I have to fly out of this airport everytime I come to AZ to see my fam. Its really expensive to fly from Tucson to SFO, and they PHX flights are just cheaper. Of course this means that you have to spend time in the Phoenix airport, which just blows.

-First of all even though they have an employee check in line for security, everytime I'm standing in line I have at least 3 airport workers cut in front of me like its the thing to do. No apologies or sheepish looks because they're line-jumping me. Just big fat airport ass staring me down.

-Second the cheapest bottle of water I was able to find was $5. For WATER. And there are maybe 4 water fountains in the entire airport. Great job on the dehydration crisis guys.

-Third, in the last two years I have flown out of this airport six times. Each of these times they changed my gate at the very last minute to one that is completely on the other side of the airport.

Yesterday was one of these phenomenal days that I got to spend time in the airport from hell. It was so hot inside the terminal and my mouth was dry, so therefore I was forced to buy overpriced water.
As usual some big guy pushed in front o me in the security line just as I was taking off my shoes. Then had the nerve to tell me to back it up and give him space!
Then as usual my gate changes 5 mins before boarding so I have to walk myself to the other side of the airport, which takes a good 10 mins. Only to get to my gate and find that my flight has been cancelled. Surely you would have known that info while I was rushing to get to my new gate??

I was in security line last week. Note the fact that I said ""line"" because there is usually none when I come here. There were only 2 security checkpoint stations open. I don't know, maybe 2 people called in sick because these things happen, right? 

The only issue I had with this line was having to listen to this Alex P. Keaton wannabe complain about the line. You know the type- bright little bushy eyed college student, dressed in his suit, acting like know it all who somehow find a way to share with some poor travelers-his major, his goals, and his opinion on how the airport could improve this line process. 

Anyways, as I am sure many will agree there are some airports in this country that border on total anarchy at all times..... So, yeah there was a line in terminal 4, but it was orderly, efficient, and moved fast. 

The airport offers booties and zip locks. Security smiles at me, asks me how my day is going all while maintaining order at the checkpoint.

Arriving at Sky Harbor and need to catch a cab-no problem, its easy and you leave with a comment card. Guess what? I had a bad cab experience, I filled out that comment card and mailed it off fully expecting it to go into a black hole. Nope, I got an apology letter in the mail the next week. It didn't stop there! I got a follow up phone call to further investigate my complaint! Can you believe it- an airport that solicits feedback, and has a system in place to address issues that are brought to their attention?

To give those who dislike Sky Harbor the benefit of the doubt I will say that maybe the terminal I use functions better than the rest, or maybe my love for this airport is based off the fact that I am from RI where the checkpoint security system is nothing more than a inconvenient joke.

My experience was seamless. )Keep in mind, I checked into my flight and received my boarding pass in advance and didn't need to check any luggage.

On my return, I merely had to walk to security from the drop off area. Security was fast and efficient (and friendly) and they didn't give me half the hassles that I received from my home airport (YYZ). After security, I was able to walk to my gate direct with ease. Total time from drop off to gate\/restaurant - 25 minutes MAX. 

The selection of food in terminal B was pretty good as well - I'll detail my experience at Cowboy Ciao soon.

Phoenix has special place in US aviation.  Yes, it may be one of the only major hub airports that will shut down because it's too damn hot to fly.  Be warned.

TSA had to place each of my clear bags into the bomb-matter-detecting machine, but the agent was more than courteous, explaining the process and what would happen if the machine alarmed.  Luckily it didn't.  Even though I had over a dozen bags that had to be scanned, I was done in 5 minutes.

There's not much in the Delta portion of Terminal 3, but Starbucks and Wendy's are usually open for breakfast, though the lines are quite long.

Now that the construction is done, it's much easier to find the rental car shuttle.

Having flown directly this time around, my overall experience in PHX was much better. Pretty easy to navigate without having to hustle around and make any terminal changes. 

I also appreciate La Grand Orange, a local eatery, in the Southwest terminal. Though a BK croissandwich or McGriddle isn't the worst breakfast ever, this one was way healthier and much more tasty.

Security line wasn't too bad, employees seemed in relatively good spirits. Nothing too much to complain about, other than the sheer amount of difficulty that one has to go through to change airlines. Still don't understand the LAX mentality here.

PUBLIC TRANSIT: there's a Skytrain that takes you from the airport terminals to the 44th St light rail station. The light rail then takes you directly to downtown Phoenix (about 15-20 minutes, a couple of stops), and only $2 one-way! Convenient and cheap! 

CONCESSIONS: Lots of local eateries, like Matt's Big Breakfast, Sweet Republic (ice cream), and Four Peaks Brewing (this place was really crowded!). There was a good variety of restaurants too, from burgers to Mexican to sandwiches. There were also the usual Asian fast food chains like Panda Express and Pei Wei, as well as Peets for coffee. There were retail stores, like the Valley of the Sun, that were selling Arizonan-themed souvenirs, like cactus jellies and candies, hot sauce, little cactus plants, Sonoran desert print socks, etc. 

WI-FI: FREE! 

OTHER: PHX has my favorite, the water bottle refilling stations and plenty of them throughout. There are also Bank of America and Chase ATMs throughout the airport. There were also power charging stations for your electronic devices. These stations were not very big and had essentially three sides, each with outlets and USB ports. The fourth side just had the image of a giant green battery symbol. Can't really fit a lot of people without crowding around, but it's something. Another cool thing I noticed was that if you walk along the moving walkways, there are signs for the FitPHX Trail. I suppose this is an indoor trail that you walk for exercise during your layover or while waiting for your flight to depart, but the signs show the various mountains in Phoenix that you can see from that particular spot, outside the window, like Camelback Mountain. I thought this was kind of a cool self-guided thing you could do. 

This is a really big airport. I was only in one section of one terminal, so I barely scratched the surface of this place. Thank goodness there are people movers (moving walkways). I was flying in and out of Terminal 4 and T4 alone is big. Getting from the A gates to the B gates was a bit of a trek even with the moving walkways.

Those are the only terminals I've flown out of, so I can't comment on the others. 

When I pick someone up, I like the personal touch of parking and waiting for them outside their gate :D That runs me $4 for an hour parking in the garage. 

When I'm flying out and leave my car there, I use the East Economy lot. At $9 a day, it's reasonable and much more convenient than parking off site. The airport buses run through every 15 minutes or so and go to all the terminals. 

The new PHX Sky Train is an automated train that goes between the 44th Street and Washington Valley Metro Light Rail, the East Economy parking area and Terminal 4 in it's first stage. I haven't had a chance to ride it yet, but it looks cool! :)

If you are renting a car after arrival, you need to catch a bus to get to the car rental area, 6 miles away.  Once you arrive there, you will be hit with an airport surcharge fee for car rentals at the airport, even though you had to get a bus to get 6 miles from the airport!  

If you are renting a car to go to the Grand Canyon, you must drive completely through the city and suburbs, as the Grand Canyon is on the opposite side of the city, compared to the airport.  You'll have to make that drive twice, a second time to return the car -not a fun drive in the afternoon rush hour, with road signs directing you to the airport, not the car rental!

If you are going on the light rail system to downtown Phoenix, you will also have to catch a bus to get to the nearest light rail system stop on the very edge of the airport, but not within walking distance.  Undoubtably the taxi companies vetoed any light rail stop in the center of the airport, so they won't lose business!

If you are returning a car, and taking a taxi to downtown, you have to return the car to the car rental area, take a bus 6 miles to the airport, and then catch a taxi to downtown.  No taxis at the car rental area!   

On the positive side, the airport is only about 7 miles and a $22 cab ride from downtown Phoenix.

However, it's improved in 1 important area and gets bumped up 1 Star for it....the food has improved in the gate areas.

Since my last review, they've added local Arizona restaurants like La Grande Orange and Sir Veza's Taco Garage.  Awesome move by the airport.  At least we're doing something right here.

Also, they've added an art display in the gate area before security.  Over the Summer they had bolo ties on display from all over the State.  Very cool.

I'm comparing it to 2 other airports I also fly\/flew out of frequently: Denver, and Spokane. Denver: nightmare. Spokane: heaven.

Phoenix\/Sky Harbor falls in between those two. SH is definitely not as hard to navigate as Denver. If you get lost in SH, you're pretty pathetic. No offense, but there are signs everywhere and you don't have to take a train. Also, there are moving walkways everywhere too. And, when I've been there, those skycap guys who drive you around (if you ask) are always around too. So you could ask for directions, if you were that lost.

On the other hand, terminal 4 can be a nightmare... when it comes to parking\/being dropped off. I've done both, many times, and hot damn. I'm really surprised more people don't get into accidents at SH when they drop off people. Also, the security guys outside yell at you if you dare stay there longer for any more than 5 seconds. I mean, really. I was carrying a heavy bag walking to my boyfriend's car when a security guy yelled at him to ""keep moving."" Ummm... I'm right here dude!! Sorry I can't run any faster to catch his car!

I fly Southwest mostly, though I've flown Alaska (terminal 2). Terminal 2 is obviously a lot less bothersome than 4, because it's less used. However, I don't remember how good the food options are in Terminal 2 so... expect fast food.

Terminal 4 has pretty great food options. They've got my requirements: Einstein's and Starbucks. They also have some Mexican food restaurant options, and a Cinnabon! They really have a lot of options, so you won't starve.

Free wi-fi. YES!

Bags arrive quickly. YES! When Denver totally ruins your bag (thanks, DIA!) and it finally gets delivered in Phoenix, the Southwest front desk people are really nice and accommodating, no matter how pissed you are. I'm speaking from personal experience, in case you couldn't tell! :)

Perhaps some of you recall my last cross-country travel experience (3 days stuck at SFO waiting for a flight out...). This time was not much better. 

But the airport staff at Phoenix made my excruciating delay that much better by providing me with tissues, sprite (for my tummy), tons of pillows, and enough blankets to warm my shivering, shaking, feverish body.

There is free wifi here that is actually quite fast 3.89Mbps download and 31.48Mbps upload(speedtest.net).  Pretty good selection of restuarants.

The baggage claim and transportation processes are smooth. There were south and north side doors that led to the taxi\/transportation area. Each door is numbered, which made it a breeze to figure out which door to exit to get to my shuttle. 

Upon return, they pulled one of my bags without saying a word. Before I even went through the scanner I spotted my computer bag at the end of the belt. So, when I finally approached my computer bag and my other bag wasn't there, I initially thought that it was missing or someone had taken off with it. No one ever saying ""your bag was pulled"", after about five minutes I was finally informed that they needed to search my bag. No worries. Just weird that they didn't have the respect to let me know as I exited the scanner or approached my other bag, that the bag that they pulled was in safe hands.  Uggg.

I have never really had an issue with TSA, and it doesn't really matter what airport you are at, you will have to deal with TSA, so just have your boarding card, id ready, smile at the agent, give them the info they want, tell them to have a nice day, odds are you will see they are pretty easy to get along with.

The rental car area is miles from the actual airport and there was no express way for the buses to get in and out.  It is an extraordinarily inefficient mousetrap that adds on at least 20 minutes to your commute.  On top of that, the rental vehicles are expensive, and there isn't a gas station remotely near the rental car return center.  If you are local or a frequent traveler you probably figure all of this stuff out, but if you are a first timer, it is very frustrating.

This could have just been the day I was there, but the security lines were woefully understaffed.  They only had 2 of 6 lines running the day I was there.  Because of this, a bottleneck was being caused by the priority treatment that families, those in wheelchairs, and business class elite receive.  I am all for this preferential treatment, that wasn't the problem, but because the line moved so slow, there were periods of time where these were the only folks who were moving through at all.  The security folks were having a tough time simply keeping up with them.  It took 45 minutes to get through a line that was only 50% full.  I perish the thought of  what it would be like if they had a more substantial group of travelers.

On the plus side, I found the airport clean, but that is a base expectation for an airport.  There were good food options in the terminal, but not at the gate.  Because of the aforementioned security bottleneck, you would be crazy on eating anywhere but your gate for fear of missing your flight.

Nope, this was just a short walk to the baggage claim area (of course it would depend upon what gate you are at).

If you're travelling Southwest or US Airways, you will unfortunately have to use Terminal 4. While it is the new and largest Terminal, it is also the busiest....by FAR!!!!! I can never accurately predict how busy it will be. On any random Friday, I can expect a LONG, SLOW security line-especially when I'm running late. I still fail to understand how they will only man 2 of the 3 i.d check stations when the lines are long......and don't get me started on the security and x-ray stations. I got to experience the awesome new airport in Singapore and thinking about while in line at Terminal 4 at Sky Harbor almost makes me cry every time.

Where this terminal is the best is in the choice of food and drinks. This is where Terminal 4 shines. They close early though, so if you're leaving after 8:00pm, forget about a drink, Pizza Slut or Cinnabon.
Terminal 2 is quite the opposite-fast and easy to check-in and get past security. It is a BREEZE and about as stress free as you can get in the U.S. The flip side is that there is ONE bar and it is lame. So there is absolutely nothing to do with the spare time you have, having anticipated that security was going to take forever after experiencing Terminal 4. 
So to sum up, Terminal 4 has lots of bars and food venues that you WON'T be able to experience because it took so long to get through security. And as stressed as you are after security, it really sucks because you'll NEED a drink-but your flight's leaving in 6 minutes.
You will probably be relaxed with time to kill if you use Terminal 2, but HOW you kill that time is going to be problematic.",2,1,2

That day they actually shut down the airport since their temperature charts did not go up that high. They say hot air does not have the same lift and the planes could have trouble taking off and landing. Sounds like a lot of hot air to me.

It's easy to forget when they were only using terminal 1, 2, 3 and the fancy 4 was still on the drawing board. The airport was pretty outdated and needed a good facelift.

Sky Harbor has improved significantly over the years and it's really starting to show. The selection of trendy and tasty restaurants has grown to a number that almost gets me excited to go flying again. Nothing like a giant meal to keep you sleeping while you travel.

Usually fly out of terminal 4 when it's up to me. It is the newest of the bunch and much better than the others. Occasionally we will use terminal 3 when the boss is paying. I think he is a Delta fan or something.

TSA is about the same as any other airport. Not very friendly and pretty large to say the least. Once had one tell me how great the donuts were nearby and how in 5 minutes he was out of there and on break. Ok ... I know where he is going.

My grandmother, bless her heart, wanted to buy my ticket with her flyer miles. On Friday night we arrived at the ticket counter and they appeared to be closed. Though I believe that we went to the wrong counter. We vowed to come back at six the next morning and by golly I was up at 5:22 a.m.

I'm not a happy morning person so I'm quite asleep. My grandmother is awake and on a mission. We pay $4 for parking and walk up to the ticket counter, no line, no waiting. Things are looking pretty good.

My grandmother says she wants to buy a ticket for me using her flyer miles. The ticket lady looks at us and asks us if we had made a reservation.
""What, we have to make a reservation to come to the airport and buy a ticket?""
My grandmother is irritated with the lady and it hasn't even been 2 minutes. She doesn't let this show, but I can feel it.

I tell her I need a ticket from Phoenix to Dublin and I tell her Sept. 15.
""Booked,"" she replies.
""Well, try the sixteenth.""
""Booked.""
""The fourteenth?""
""Booked.""
""Try everything from the thirteenth to the twenty-first.""
""Booked, booked, booked, booked, booked, booked, booked, booked, booked.""
""Really? This is more than a month in advance? A friend of mine just bought a plane ticket to France three weeks prior to her departure date. Try another airline, maybe Aer Lingus. I found round trip tickets from $768 and one-ways for $459.""
""That's a really good deal you should probably go with that if you can get it.""
""Well, how much is a one-way ticket for Aer Lingus on the 15th of Sept.?""
""$2,000.""

I was afraid that my grandmother was going to have a heart attack. She gasped and stood there with her mouth open. We walked upstairs and sat at a table to call the flight fund people that were supposed to make a reservation for us and magically bestow the flyer miles.
After giving the guy on the phone her life story for computer input on his end he asks, ""So where is your grand-daughter going?""
""From Phoenix to Dublin.""
""Ma'am I'm sorry this is US only. I'll have to transfer you to our international department.""

I sit and stare at the people walking through the airport at this ungodly hour (for me anyway.)
Now she is talking to a woman in the international sector for the miles.
The woman asks what my return date is and my grandmother tells her that the ticket is one-way. I am going for school for a year and have no idea when I will be back.
The woman kindly informs us that unless I am a citizen of the UK I can not get a one-way ticket to Ireland by using flyer miles. But I can get a round trip ticket and then just change the date for a fee of $275! And also to do that my grandmother is 20,000 miles short, she only has 30,000 miles which would have been enough for the one-way ticket.

My grandmother asks how much would it be to just buy the 20,000 miles and the woman on the other end tells her that it would probably cost as much, if not more, than buying a regular ticket.
""Well how much is a regular round trip ticket?""
My grandmother turns white as a ghost. She is breathless as her mouth hangs wide open. I am afraid her heart actually did stop.
She looks at me as she writes the figure on the paper in front of her.
$4,798.

I tell her to hang up. We are going home and I'm going on the internet.
I bought a one-way ticket from Phoenix to Dublin leaving on Sept. 15th for $530.
Funnier yet, I actually got the ticket for the two airlines the ticket lady said was either booked or expensive... US Airways and Aer Lingus.

If you've going to fly out of Phoenix very often my advice would be to start using US Air or SouthWest because a) it's a hub for both of them and b) you'll have much better flight choices and c) because of the competition, the prices tend to be better. The other terminals, by comparison, are nearly deserted. Terminals 2 and 3 have very limited food choices. Terminal 4 has improved a lot in that regard. 

There is a lot of parking available, both on site and off site. The off site parking, naturally, is cheaper but you have to wait for the buses to bring you to the terminal. Compared to other airports of comparable size the on site parking is not that expensive. If it's a business trip and you are getting reimbursed for the parking, just park on site and save yourself the hassle. Honestly, the best way to get in and out of Sky Harbor is not to drive at all but to use a transportation service. I'm not talking about Stupper-Shuttle - don't get me started on them - but a real sedan service that will drop you at the curb and meet you at the security gate when you arrive back home. 

If you can, print your boarding pass at home rather than waiting in line at the airport. The airline clubs, in my view, are a waste of money. As another reviewer pointed out, the wi-fi access is now free at Sky Harbor. I used to belong to the US Air club but let it lapse. The snacks are not that good, they were charging for drinks. Unless you are regularly connecting through Phoenix how much time are you really going to spend in the airport? Now if you're connecting and have a long layover then it might be worthwhile but otherwise I'd skip it. 

I got a laptop stolen here once so a word about security. If you have a laptop computer, put it through the x-ray machine last and don't take your eye off it for a moment. Particularly if it's very busy.",4,0,2

It's within 10 to 15 minutes driving distance from probably over a million people in the Valley. 5 minutes from downtown Phx. 10 minutes from downtown Tempe. 15 minutes from Ahwatukee. Granted, our kick-ass highway system plays a role in that convenience. But convenient it is, unlike most airports of similar or larger sized cities.

In 12 months you'll be able to park in your suburb or have someone drive 5 minutes to the closest light rail stop, and the Metro will take you straight to Sky Harbor. (To be accurate, it'll take you to one last shuttle stop, and a shuttle will pick you up and take you to Sky Harbor; a direct connection is being constructed for the future). 

The terminals generally suck except for Terminal 4, which is okay. I can remember at least 2 occasions when I got drunk-dialed by friends from Terminal 4. Each time they were passing through Phoenix with no intention of letting me know, had some extra time, sidled up to one of the Terminal 4 bars, and *BAM* they were sloshed on bloody marys and suddenly wanted to catch up with yours truly. 

Thumbs up on the free wifi. 

The hourly parking garages are comfortably close to the terminals with minimal walking involved. The long-term lots are more of a pain in the ass to deal with but that's the nature of the beast. They do have air-conditioned lobbies and garage parking though. 

Granted, it may be because I'm a local and am so familiar with Sky Harbor, but the most important reason I like it is the speed and efficiency with which I can (a) drive in, pick up a passenger, and drive out, and (b) get off a plane, pick up my baggage, and step outside to the curb to be picked up. (Most likely by one friend in particular who is incapable of showing up on time, so that screws it all up, but that's not Sky Harbor's fault. And yeah, you know who you are chump).",1,0,1

Food...
Sky Harbor really needs to step up the game making each terminal section have equal choice\/quality of food. I'm not saying they all need 5 star places, just make them equal. This is a busy airport - get some decent places. Airports like Seattle, Denver, etc put Phoenix to shame

One gate area has only crappy hot dogs or burger king (barf king). I refuse to buy that swill.

Terminals...
As Jasen F pointed out, the terminals are a dump. The ONLY exception is the Southwest spot in Terminal 4 which as been completely redone. Bravo to them... it is the only decent place in Sky Harbor.

Security...
The one smart\/good thing they did was put security at each terminal so there are more lanes overall and less bottlenecks. The bad thing is they use body scanners so this slows it down a ton... makes things 3 to 5 times longer per person.",2,1,0

The Airport has some neat art work near the ticket counters. I wish I could spend time admiring it, but even if you're several hours early, you can never ""relax"" until you've made it all the way through security. I'd encourage them to move the art pieces to the terminal so people waiting for flights, post-security can enjoy them. 

TSA and Security is what it is... they haven't caught any Terrorists yet, but I'll be darned, if I don't have to produce 16 different notarized documents to bring my insulin on the plane with me. I wish we didn't have to take off our shoes, because it encourages poor footwear choice, especially if you arrive somewhere where you have to walk pretty far to get to your connection and\/or front door. 

Once you're in the terminal, I have to hand it to Sky Harbor. They restaurant selection is robust. Everything from burgers, coffee and Mexican Food, to McDonalds, and NYPD pizza. Yes, everything is a little more expensive, but you don't have a choice, and you will pay for it. 

The staff is mostly pleasant, and helpful. I wish the bathrooms had more places to hang things and\/or a shelf to store your rolling suitcase while you went potty - but that's a pipe dream.

When flying out of here to go to Vegas, I parked pretty far away, and had a bus shuttle me into the airport. This was a fast and painless experience and only took about 10 minutes total. Once I got into the airport and got my boarding pass I went through security check within about 5 minutes. There were a lot of people there, however, the people from TSA were working fast and were still checking everything from what it seemed to me at least. So within 20 minutes of arriving to the airport I am already inside the airport and able to get to my terminal if I were in a hurry.

Since I wasn't in a hurry because I give myself plenty of time to get to my destination when flying, I ended up getting something to eat at Round Table Pizza.

It is outdated, super crowded, it feels dirty and it is the home of US Airways, the biggest carrier in and out of this airport.

Terminal 4 is configured rather poorly.  The terminal reminds me of a backwards E, like the second E in EMIN3M, except that there is another prong to the backwards E.  The concourses are not spacious at all, the seating limited, and consequently the crowds spill out into the walkway areas.
.  
To go from one end of Terminal 4 to the other necessitates using really narrow moving walkways which are on the spine of the E.  It is really hard to maneuver if you want to pass the throngs given the limited space.  The distances are long, the bruises will be many, either to you but most likely given by you as you negotiate your way between flights.

The other thing that must be mentioned is that Sky Harbor is not a business person's airport but rather a tourist airport.  I think that contributes a lot to the chaos.  When an airport is full of amateurs, like Sky Harbor, there are bottlenecks of humanity in all the wrong places.  Further exacerbating the tourist nature of this airport are the snowbirds who flock here so that they can seek skin cancer in all months of the year, not just summer in their native habitats of the Upper Midwest.

Food is awful fast junk $$$, etc, & you are in the middle of nowhere unless you drove or have a uni-cycle in your pack.

Only Americans would know that.

After all that's done, you can get on the small, smelly plane with a bunch of rude, inconsiderate jerks & get the last seat in the back by the clogged toilet.  But hey, at least you made it alive.

Most recently I was extremely happy with Sky Harbor as I was super late for my flight.  It did take forever to find the place to get gas and then drop off my car - it was absolutely confusing and as i was rushing to the bus, I found out each bus goes to different terminals.  That sucked. I had to wait for my Terminal 1 bus to get there as I was nervously checking my watch thinking when the next flight was because the security line would be absolutely ridiculous.  I get on the bus and the driver says I have ""plenty of time"".  This was 30 minutes before my flight is supposed to depart.  I go to security and I'm shocked - I am one of 2 people in the line.  It takes me all of 2 minutes to get through and I have casual yet flustered conversation with the guard and realized I only had 25 minutes before my flight left.  I was able to get some food and make it to my flight as they were boarding Zone 3.  Sucks I had to check my bag but who cares I was so happy I made my flight.

The workers are nice, however going back, I  remember, the lady Had me check in my bag so I had to pay I think $35 for it when I didn't need to check it in coming. She had an attitude and I knew didn't want to be there.

This time around I flew with Southwest and their gating area is actually split. It goes C1 to I think C8 was in one area and from C9 to C17 was in another. I'm sorry I forgot how many gates there were, and where it stopped from, but I remember that cuz I was supposed be @ gate C4 and then I got moved to gate C16 which was in another part. Well they have those comfy leather chairs that has outlets connected to them which made my wait time better.

Also getting to terminals 3 & 4 you have to take what they call the train to it. It's short travel time on it. I went on it and it was fun lol. It's all still connected but you do need to take it if need be.

Positives:
-The name Sky Harbor is certainly the coolest airport name in the country.  No dodgy old white man lays claim to the appellation of Phoenix's gate to the skies
-Free WiFi (this is such a necessity for a good airport nowadays)
-Never actually crowded (security is usually a breeze)
-Connection to the Lightrail (though in 2013 there will be a direct connect instead of a bus)
-North and South curbs make picking people up a breeze, especially when you understand how the airport allows equal access from East or West Valley

Negatives:
-The whole ground transportation system is poorly labeled (especially when compared to the paragon of this: Oakland)
-Baggage takes forever to make it from the plane to you 
-North and South curbs make no sense to a visitor

Airports are meant to help people get from here to there, and I just want it to be well organized.

I have flown to and from sky harbor through terminals 2 and 4, and had a layover on southwest where I didn't leave the airport.  These three experiences were so crappy that this is the first time I have felt a need to actually review an airport.  I have flown to and from most of the major airports in the u.s. and I dislike this one the most.  (My dad was also an airport employee, so I understand the ins and outs of airport operation and the needless complaints of most travelers, so I'm usually complaint-free)

First the rental car center---everybody having to wait in long lines for one bus to take them to their terminal---this is the reason I don't use SFO's long term parking shuttle.  What's the problem with car companies having their own shuttles, frequently picking up smaller numbers of people?  Renting at SFO is the same idea (airtrain instead of bus though) but somehow sfo is far more efficient.

The overabundance of feeder streets circling the airport directing people to merge here, merge there---I picked up my wife and it took 10 minutes to get out of there (and that was after the whole north\/south curb thing).  And the time spent on the rental car shuttle ride to the airport was like I was actually driving back to California.  At least in Denver I know that everything is spread out; sky harbor is supposed to be compact and in the middle of Phoenix.  And why, when we got to the terminal, couldn't the rental shuttle driver open the back door to let everyone out faster (if you haven't been through it, these are huge city buses instead of normal small hertz\/Alamo\/etc shuttles)?

Security in both terminals was long, but with so many people traveling I guess you can't do much about it other than adding more checkpoints.  It did piss me off in terminal 2 when I had waited for 25 minutes and then noticed the secret right-hand lane that anybody can go through---why weren't airport people getting people to go through that one?  I saw it at first and assumed it was the first-class line, but it actually wasn't.

At this point the little things start to annoy you:  the battlestar galactica robot voice making the standard security announcements, the plastic barrier surrounding the baggage claim in terminal 4 trapping you inside, and the hasn't-been-upgraded-since-1960 baggage claim in terminal 2.  The taxi ride to my hotel was $25 but back to the airport the ride was $9; although at least getting a taxi is easier than in las vegas.

Maybe I had wrong expectations that let me down---the supposed convenience of being close to downtown, and two phoenix residents saying that I could check in 1 hr 30 min before the flight and would be fine and that ""it goes fast"".  I guess I learned my lesson and will check in way earlier next time.",0,0,0

My biggest problem though is they keep giving my wife issues at TSA.  Quite honestly the pat down here can be considered offensive,  though they do offer to take the person to an area out of sight.  From my point of view TSA operates with different sets of guidelines in each airport.  

They have several nice shops before you enter security like a Starbucks, a PGA shop and bookstore.  If you get there early enough you can enjoy a nice cup of coffee before going through.

Arrivals: All of the terminals connect to the main hub. You'll head downstairs for baggage claim and rental cars. If you're picking up someone curbside, be prepared to be frustrated because it's pretty much chaos during busy times.

Departures: If you have a rental car, make sure you arrive extra early to account for taking the shuttle and the long hike to whichever terminal you are flying from. Food options are okay - the airport is slowly moving from boring chains to more local places. The seating areas are usually pretty cramped and outlets can be found (especially in the Southwest terminals) but you're better off preparing for standing and no outlets.

Connections: I always allow at least 45 minutes for a connection here. You may be tricked by thinking your connection is close because it is in the same terminal but there are a few spokes for each terminal so getting from C12 to C1 (for example) requires you to get to the end of your arriving terminal and then head to the other part of the terminal over the length of two moving walkways and then to the end of the next part of the terminal.

I've been to dozens of airports all over the world so I can say that I have a pretty good idea on how some of them work. Compared to other international airports this place isn't that bad. Now the rundown of this place.

There is a cellphone lot that is pretty nice, lines and arrows direct traffic. Everyone goes the same direction unless you're so stupid you can't follow an arrow.  There are giant electronic signs showing all flights arriving and which terminal to go to. If you miss your turn to pick someone up, that's okay because the terminals are in circles. You just keep driving and you'll come back around.

I usually use their check in sections outdoors so I only have to haul my suitcase from the curb to the counter 3 feet from the curb and they tag it and take it. I'm then hands free to roam around the place.

Airport security isn't too overwhelming and it never takes me long to get through it. Just follow the rules online, don't try to pack or carry on anything stupid like lighters, liquids over a certain amount, etc. Wear shoes easy to slip in and out of, try to avoid wearing belts. Eat before you go because the water and food are very overpriced.  Compared to other international airports I've been to, that's the one downfall of phoenix is their ridiculous prices. I can get a simple ham and cheese sandwich at one of the stands for $10+ and in Hong Kong I can sit down for a meal for maybe $5 more.

Never had an issue leaving out of Sky Harbor but I've had 1 issue returning.  I had a neck pillow and I dropped it and I hadn't crossed the forbidden line yet. I could see the no return line but was still nowhere near it.  When I turn around to walk back to grab my pillow sitting on the floor, security yelled at me and told me I couldn't return for it.  I kindly let them know I hadn't cross that point yet where the sign says no return beyond this point. I pointed to the pillow on the ground and told them I wanted to just grab it but nope, even though they could see it laying on the ground they kept screaming at me in front of everyone to leave it there.  I asked if a worker could bring it to me and they declined.  I was extremely annoyed considering good neck pillows can cost $30 at times. To have to watch your $30 sit on the floor without permission to grab it is just stupid.

Other issues I've had is them cancelling flights and leaving myself and everyone else sitting in the airport with nothing to do for hours. Nothing was opened to grab a drink or food or snacks. You couldn't shop for books or do anything really.  Whereas other international airports I go to have something open late at night. The entire place doesn't shut down completely like this place did. And they never gave us really any status updates as to when we'd be leaving either so you were required to just sit and wait blindly. 

Other than the few bad experiences it's not a bad place. Assuming every flight leaves on time you get through pretty quickly and without hassle and they've yet to lose my luggage.",4,1,1

Yes, the airport maybe clean - however, the restaurants, even by airport standards, are below par and overpriced - the usual assortment of greasy spoons paying sky high rent - but really nothing in Phoenix could compare with three plus hours I spent hiking to and waiting in various lines, the massive crowds easily numbering over a thousand, only to find myself, at the end of the day, accommodated in a hotel, having missed my connection.

- Airport has three terminals with #4 serving the most traffic (Southwest, US Airways)
- On-site and off-site parking available for a fee ($8 to $25 per day depending on location)
- Free wi-fi but expect laggy service as this is a densely populated airport
- Dining options depend on your terminal with #4 having the most to choose from
- Expect construction pretty much at every terminal- there's always something going on but it typically does not get in the way of your travel plans
- Rental cars are located off-site and require transit via shuttle to get to and from the rental compound
- Airport security mostly runs smoothly but I suggest getting to Sky Harbor at least 90 minutes prior to your departure time. If it's a heavy traffic time (Monday morning, holidays, etc.) then 2 hours is a safer bet. 
- Terminal 4 uses the body scanner so expect to go through it. You can always opt out but then you're at the mercy of TSA pat downs, etc. Just be advised and know what to expect.
- There are many variety shops all over the airport, but again, terminal four has the most selection- easy way to kill time if you're on a layover or arrive super early. Everything from jewelry to sports fare, southwest souvenirs to kids shops. Of course you have the meda stores with plenty of reading materials available and snacks as well.
- Terminal 4 is pretty large and you can expect some walking from baggage claim to security to your terminal- depending on your airline and gate number of course. Just saying, be prepared for a walk if you are in the C concourse (high number gate).
- There are TV's all over, mostly tuned to CNN or an NFL game on Sundays. 
- There are kids areas located in some of the D gates terminal 4 - they have a kids level table with dedicated TV to cartoons or some kids variety show. Pretty cool for families travelling with young ones that need a distraction as I know how stressful the flights can be with the kiddos.
- Sky Harbor is very business traveler friendly - you'll see numerous suits in this airport as there are connections from Southwest and US Airways (major connection destination for both airlines)

Always remember to be prepared to WAIT at any airport. Patience is key when travelling and the more you are mentally ready to accept this the easier your travels will be, trust me.

Lots of natural light.  And, this is a decidedly un-stabby airport; i.e., getting stabbed for no reason is highly unlikely here (which to me is an important criterion when I am evaluating airports and other public accommodations). 

TSA people here are friendly; like they are in the Southeast. Prechecked line is as easy as it is at John Wayne, even.  This is a different world, I tell ya.

Signage is clearer and better positioned than at many airports, so that new visitors and rental car returners don't make a bunch of wrong turns. Note that the closest gas station is a block away from rental return so you don't have to fool with all that until the last minute. 

The gates are somewhat bunched up so seats in the lounges go fast.  The greeters are helpful and friendly so that you immediately realize that you are not in California.  

I do believe that it is high time that recharging stations go with each seat and along the walls rather than a little four foot long counter every 100 feet or so, although I do appreciate that being there.  

The car rental facility is as big as some regional airport terminals and clean and modern.   It is not really on-site, so you have to ride a shuttle to get there, which I don't like (MEM and SNA handle rental cars so very well) but PHX has its very own rental parking structure so you get in and out very easily.   The shuttle, however, is fast and the drivers will give you the lowdown on all events in the city, plus instructions on which shuttle to board when you are flying home. This place is so not California. Kudos on that.

There aren't really other choices in the market but we should say it when people are doing things right.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

F*ck you PHX Airport TSA. F*ck you. 

I flew into PHX from Jacksonville, FL a few days ago. When I was in the security line at JAX, I realized I had forgotten my driver's license in my running shorts at home. I freaked and broke out in a cold sweat. I thought for sure I wasn't getting on the plane. Then I remembered I have a concealed weapons permit, took it out and hoped for the best. 

The TSA agent that checked my ID was very pleasant and said the ID was fine since I also had alternative means of proving that I was me. Those other items were my social security card, and believe it or not, a SAM's Club membership card which has my photo on it. They let me through, no problems. 

Fast forward to today when I'm at PHX and trying to head back to Jacksonville. 
The TSA agent says that my concealed weapon permit won't work even though I also showed him the same pieces of ID that I showed the agent in JAX. He called a manager. The manager said I could go through but would have to be ""escorted"" by him as a +1. Let me explain to you what a plus one means...

It means they make you go through the peek-a-boo - I see you - X-Ray machine, THEN you get pulled over to the side and thoroughly frisked like a prison inmate, THEN they thoroughly go through all your shit even after it too had just passed through an X-Ray machine. Due to this, I had to throw away my hair product because apparently it was slightly too many ounces. Not happy about this. That hair product has passed through a number of airports with no problems BUT NOT AT PHX! 

Anyway, I'm sitting here in the terminal waiting for my flight, writing this review, stewing. I know I should be happy that I got through but Im not. 

The TSA website says (I checked it before I ever came today):

         'Adult passengers (18 and over) are required to show a U.S. federal or state-issued photo ID in order to be allowed to go through the checkpoint and onto their flight.'

On What Planet is a Concealed Weapon Permit, issued by the STATE of FLORIDA Not a STATE ISSUED photo-ID? 

        - It has my photo on it, my name, DOB, sex and race.
        - It's Issued by the state of Florida

What am I missing here!? So it doesn't have my address on it... Big f*cking deal! Why do you have to know my address!? You're trying to identify me, not pick me up for a date! 

In addition, I had to go through an extensive background check to obtain that concealed weapon permit. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS BREATHE AND KIND OF KNOW HOW TO DRIVE A CAR to get a driver's license. 

Look.... I know I'm the dumb ass for forgetting my driver's license but at what point did people lose the ability to use common sense? This was a ridiculous waste of everyone's time, in addition to being very frustrating. Have the terrorists won by default? Maybe they have.

So why 2 stars? Why not 1? Why not zero, half a star, a quarter of a star, negative stars? Well... because that isn't an option. Although, as anyone who has been through a shitty experience like this can attest, it would be phenomenal if it were possible.

The other reason for two stars is because this listing is for the PHX Airport as a whole and not just the TSA. 

I look at airports like this:

1. Security is 60% of the review and what causes the most amount of anxiety                            for me so it weighs heavily on the total rating. 
   
2. Then there's 25% for dining and drinking options
 
3. 15% Everything else.

That said, PHX as a whole is decent. They have free WIFI which is always appreciated and they have a convenient bus system that runs on the regular to take you to the rental car building. 

I didn't get to peruse the dining options so I can't comment on that. Even if I had, I couldn't stomach dropping more than 2 stars after today. 

I know I'll be going back to PHX Airport. There's no way around it for me. I can certainly tell you that I won't forget my driver's license again. And with 100% assurity, I can also tell you... the PHX TSA WILL NOT be getting a Christmas card from me this year.",3,8,2

Did you know that on weekends at 2AM there is virtually nothing open in Terminal Two?  Hope you brought snacks or quarters for vending or the will to go on the hunt for food elsewhere on foot, in the middle of the night.

Because you might just have midnight munchies.  I kept smelling this rather delightful scent; it seemed like there had to be something open nearby, baking chocolate chip cookies late into the night.  One of the guards started chatting with me when he saw me standing vaguely in the middle of a hallway, sniffing the air like an animal.  

So as it turns out, just as touted in two paragraphs in my Marketing 101 textbook, there really are businesses that pipe artificial deliciousness through the air vents with hopes of getting you to splurge on snacks.

But seriously, when there's nothing even open?  Should I eat my money?

Everything makes sense when you follow the signs posted.  The layout of the airport is pretty simple as well.  It has three levels in terminal 4 where I was.  One bizarre thing I did notice was that you take an escalator down from level 3 to level 1, but must take an elevator to get back up.  And the elevators are not right next to escalator.  They're close.  You just have to search.  The information booths were very helpful in helping me locate them.

The only bad experience I had was at baggage claim.  Some of the baggage staff were barking curses and behaving like gangsters.  It definitely reflected poorly on the airport.  At one point, I thought they were going to fight each other over a lunch break.  I also heard some older baggage claim staff complaining openly about how the passengers do not care at all about the way they operate.  They seemed very disgruntled.

Security was pretty tight.  In Orlando, I had to remove my shoes to go through security.  At Sky Harbor, everyone kept their shoes on.  I was randomly asked by a security guard to hold out my hands so they could pass a wand over them to look for signs of chemicals.  I've never experienced that before at any other airport.  It wasn't a bad experience.  I thought all airports had the same procedures for checking passengers, but I guess not.

Overall, it was a good experience.  It was A-OK.  I know they can make it better.  There was a lot of construction going on outside the airport.

The airport is super clean and well maintained. I feel like they update it alot because it doesn't look old like alot of the other air ports do. They also have many different places to eat in the air port that are not ridiculously expensive like every other air port. I've never had a problem flying in or out and all of my flights have been on time. My favorite thing about this airport is that you CANNOT get lost. The airport kind of just flows so you get where your supposed to be. One more cool thing about Sky Harbor is the ceiling when you go down into baggage claim. It's the coolest mosaic of colored glass. Its the one thing I remember about my childhood!!

Now you would think that with my review this air port would get a higher rating. Well because I like the air port so much I won't give it one star. I'll give it two. This is why.

I'm one of those people who has a really bad food allergy. So I have to travel everywhere with my epipen. Being the paranoid traveler I am, I called TSA and asked them what their policy was regarding an epipen. They told me that I could get it hand inspected and everything would be fine. So before I went on my trip I got a note from my doctor and had my prescription on it just in case I got hassled. 

So when I left Hawaii everything was cool. They hand inspected it and I was through security within five minutes. It was super easy and not a big deal. When I went through Sky Harbor I had it out and separate from my bags and I calmed explained the situation to the TSA agent. He then proceeded to tell me that they could not hand inspected it and it had to go through the X-ray.  I then told them that it couldn't be X-rayed and it needed to be hand inspected. He then called 3 other TSA agents to surround me. While this was happening I kept being told it could not and WOULD not be hand inspected. And if I didn't let my EPIPEN get X-Rayed I would get strip searched and my bags would be hand searched for weapons and I would miss my plane. 

I finally got tired of being bullied and harassed and let them X-ray my epipen. This whole situation took thirty minutes and by the time I was done dealing with the TSA agents I was scared and shaking. If I fly out of Arizona I will not be excited to fly out of here.",4,1,2

1)  The rental car center, accessed by lumbering buses, is too far away and is heinously slow for picking up a car.  If you are going to shunt your rental car center to some godforsaken corner of the valley, couldn't you at least arrange a dedicated skyway for the buses or a tram or monorail or train that whisks arriving passengers there?  This is one of the few things SFO has done well, while Cleveland Hopkins and Sky Harbor have done it poorly.

2)  The food options are not all that great, and as one other reviewer noted, the best bits are outside security!  Who has the cool and collected psyche to sit there idling away over a meal while gigantic queues may be forming, unseen, at the security gate while you linger?  When I arrive at an airport, my goal is to get through security at the earliest possible moment to avoid any nasty, nerve-wracking surprise death marches.  Which brings us to....

3) The security lines are WAY too understaffed for the size of this operation.  Narrow little chokepoints with TSA agents of the bellowing variety, and rarely more than two lines open to get into any concourse, unless you want to walk endlessly to see if the line is shorter at another entry.   Heinous!

4)  Add in an unimaginative mix of vendors and drab, Houston Bush-esque brown decor and you've got a dreary experience whether it's your destination, your departure point, or a hub for transfers.",7,4,5
