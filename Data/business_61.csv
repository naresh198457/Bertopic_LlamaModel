I'm gonna be real with you. I am not in love with Pizzeria Bianco, and had I actually had to wait in line, this rating would probably be lower. My group was lucky enough to receive the last table without any wait.

Maybe it was the fact that it's hard to impress me with pizza. Maybe it was a fluke that won't happen again. At least that's what everyone keeps telling me. But honestly, I just wasn't that impressed with the $19 pizza I received. Sadly, the leftovers I took home ended up being tossed because I was afraid to try it again. 

I've been worried about writing this for awhile (it's been sitting here unfinished for nearly a year), but in the end, my opinions haven't changed, and I sit here, still scared to return. If someone dragged me there again, or had a party there or something, I'd probably give it another shot, as I hate to write off any place after a single trip, but I honestly felt just eh about the whole thing. Thankfully none of my visiting out of town guests have cried for me to take them there.",6,1,1

Our group of 4 arrived at 4:30pm, had our name in by 5ish after waiting in line, and were three sheets to the wind (thanks to next door) and famished 3.5 hours later.  

Now, the pizza's are delicious.  And fresh.  And the environment and ambiance are top notch.   But the service was blah, almost as if there was no reason to be attentive or have personality because of where he was working.  And the wait, although we expected it, was a little much.  

It's an experience to try the famous Pizzeria Bianco, that's for sure.  I always love a local place with a great story.  My favorite part of the experience though was sitting next door, drinking too much, having a great time with friends and everyone else....all anxiously waiting for the time when their name is called.  

In the future, I'll be enjoying the pleasant, albeit non notorious,  ambiance and pizza at Classic Italian Pizza.",4,3,3

The good part now is that they are open for lunch, so the line isn't quite as long and they take RESERVATIONS! I made a res for 10 about 3 weeks out, and while it was very crowded in there with 10 people, it was well worth it.
The setting is adorable; Heritage Square, to me, is perfect downtown Phoenix. The old house is super cute, as is the bar next door. Bonus points because you can walk to the ballpark and other downtown sites.
The menu and wine\/beer lists are small, but carefully-selected and unique.
The pizza has an excellent crust with delicious, local-where-possible ingredients.
I highly recommend Pizzeria Bianco for visitors and locals!",4,0,3

First time, great experience but now this is what I think.

1. Over priced ..the green salad..greens and 3 green olives...bland dressing..$6..pizzas good but really not worth the wait nor cost. 
2. Requesting Parmesan will cost you $2, and they will not let  you take it unless you request it.
3. Customer service, I've had really better service other places. This past week, I was in there for a lunch meeting and this group of 25 came in complaining they couldn't sit together, giving our small table dirty looks and sarcastic comments geared towards our table.  The waitress was staring us down  the entire time on and it was a really uncomfortable feeling, especially when you are paying a high menu price for the food .

This has reduced wait times and the quality is still there. They've also opened a new location making it more accessible. I go every time I visit Phoenix.

This is not a place to go if you are hungry and in a hurry to eat.

I've experienced better"" couldn't be any more dead on for this place, *especially* in light how many best.pizza.ever reviews i've seen on here and from noted chefs and celebrities. for all of you who think that, i'm sorry but maybe you've never been to new york. hell, maybe you've never even been to new jersey, b\/c this wasn't any better than my local neighborhood joint. based on what i read coming into the meal, i expected the light of god to shine down on me as i took my first bite. what i got instead was, yes, an ok pizza, but nothing more than and a ridiculously overcharged one at that (and now an awful case of heartburn, but that's beside the point).

we got the margherita pizza and added wood-roasted mushrooms and sicilian anchovies. sauce was pretty good but the house made mozzarella was nothing to write home about. crust was thin and soft in the middle, crispy around the edges...and burnt. luckily, my wife and i don't mind a well-done crust, but it certainly did not exhibit the perfection that i was expecting going in. the pizza was cut into 6 slices, and was so small that i could have easily eaten the thing on my own. couldn't have been more than 10-12"" in diameter, as each slice was able to *easily* fit on the same appetizer-sized plates that we used for our pre-pizza bread (which we had to request, was not offered to us by the waiter, yet another knock against the entire experience).

the total bill for one little pizza and a $5 draft beer was $28. that's right, one pizza, no more than a personal-sized one at that, with 2 toppings was $23. in terms of accompaniments to the pizza, the menu was SO limited and when i saw the table next to us get their antipasto plate, there was no way we were paying $15 for it.

i cannot believe that anyone in their right mind would wait one hour, let alone up to 4 as some of you have written, for this pizza. maybe zagat should stick to fine dining reviews, b\/c they clearly missed the mark here. if any of my friends or relatives were to visit phoenix, my advice would be ""don't believe the hype"". personally, i can't wait to get back to new jersey and get a bigger, cheaper, and most importantly, better pizza.",5,1,3

They were open for business (we counted 3 people inside, despite the fact that there were thousands of people just outside their ""gate""). We walked up to said ""gate"" (an arbitrary line in the sand) where a pimply-faced teen growled at us that we could not cross over the line.  What?  We want to have dinner at Bianco's.  NO, he bellowed!  Perhaps he misunderstood his job, because the ONLY way to dine there was to enter from the beer fest.  He told us to go away.  We did.

Look, Bianco, if you are so paranoid, why didn't you set up a vendor table at the event so people could buy your imaginary pizza?

At some point in the last decade, I was delighted to find out that Pizzeria Bianco - right here in lil' ol' Phoenix, Arizona - had been deemed the ""Best Pizza in the United States"". This was a nice thing to be able to throw out there when suffering through the aforementioned conversations. 

Unfortunately, or so I thought, I had never been able to experience this delightful Pizza for myself. I had several conversations with folks that had gone or attempted to go that all ended in a similar manner: There was always a several hour wait, and pizza just isn't worth it. Until actually going there, which I recently did, I always assumed the wait was a testament to how great the pizza was, and Boy, was I wrong. 

So a short while ago, I ended up in Downtown Phoenix on an intended visit to the AZ Science Center. My company and myself were hungry and looking for a spot to munch. I fire up the ol' yelp machine and BOOM! Pizzeria Bianco is right next door. How convenient for me. I feared a wait, but I said let's check it out and let the cards fall where they may. Roll up and ""Heck Yeah"" no line! Now I can definitely see why there would be, because the place is tiny. But it just wasn't the case on my visit. 

Rolled in, promptly greeted and seated. I'm going off of memory here, and if I remember correctly, if you are a larger person like myself, it ain't going to be the most comfortable as the chairs and tables aren't large and accommodating. Obviously I blame myself for being a fat bastard, but it is worth noting. In any case, I peruse the menu and it was hard to decide. I let the server know it was our first time and asked if she had any recommendations. I can't remember what specifically was said by I do remember noting that it wasn't helpful at all. OK, whatever, I'll choose for myself. I ended up with a Margherita, add prosciutto. I remember thinking it seemed pricey, but for this acclaimed pizza, probably worth it. 

The wait for the pizza seemed long, but maybe it is because I am looking back through brown colored glasses. Our pizza came out, and it was just a surprise disappointment visually. I felt like I was taking part in a culinary ""The Emporer's New Clothes"". The pizza is tiny. The Pizza is thin. The cheese coverage is sparse. The pizza is burnt. At this moment I'm looking at what I'm discovering to be an overpriced pathetic pizza and thinking ""great, this thing is tiny, and there's two of us, but I'm sure as sh*t not gonna throw down another twenty for another. Hell no!"". 

So I haven't tasted the thing yet, and I'm just hoping that somehow this pizza is going to taste majestic and make up for my current state of utter let-down. Bite into what is basically a trumped up cracker and Bruh. Just Bruh. What a freaking bummer. I feel like the biggest idiot. Here I am invoking this place's name over the years to defend AZ honor and it has come to this? The most bland, disappointing, gustatory fart of a bite of food in my memory. 

I'm literally chewing on disappointment, trying to figure out anything appealing about this pizza. Literally. Just waiting to taste anything. Bland. Tasteless. I would hand you a slice if you were to ask me what sadness tastes like. To eat this pizza is to buy a $20 losing lottery ticket. It's the same thing. Eating my half of this tiny pizza had become punishment and that is just the beginning of the kick in the nuts. You actually have to pay for it. Bummer. 

So fast forward to today, my friend is telling me that a friend of his wants to go. He has heard from several other people that the place sucks and he doesn't want to. We get to to talking and I'm just getting more and more worked up about how much this place sucks. We talk about what he's heard about the place a little more and we start throwing out pizzas that we think would be less appealing and the only one that he came up with that I would possibly, not even certainly, recommend less is a lunchables pizza. Hahaha literally. The ""crust"" on a lunchables pizza is so awkwardly bad, that it's the only pizza I can think of as dissapointing. I'm going to stop at the grocery store later just to get one so I can compare to be sure. 

Morals of the story
1) if you read this far, thanks. I'm sorry it takes me so many words to express ""it sucks - overrated""
2) DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WAITING HOURS FOR THIS PATHETIC PIZZA. Literally go to any other pizza place if you value your time and money.
3) Eff you, New Yorkers. Eff you, but you win. Now eff off.",6,5,0

But....the service was something else! Started out OK, but when were were trying to finish our meal the server kept constantly coming and taking away our plates as she thought each person was finished....whether you were or not....the crust is great and some of us wanted to drizzle the olive oil on it, but we did not get the chance; the plates and the olive oil were whisked off the table in flash, no chance to dawdle! She even took the flatware from my friend WHILE she was finishing her plate! That was the last straw....I know you have to turn tables, but this was ridiculous.

When one of my coworkers sent an email to our group who was visiting Phoenix saying he had gotten us a reservation at ""The BEST pizza in the country"" i Was skeptical. Best pizza in Phoenix? Well, I wasn't disappointed! 

We had a group of 8., and we ordered almost one of everything on the menu:
Apps:
Antipasto - Wood Roasted Vegetables, Sopressata, Bite of Cheese
Spiedini - Italian Fontina wrapped in Prosciutto di Parma, served warm 
Pizza:
MARGHERITA - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil 
MARINARA - Tomato Sauce, Oregano, Garlic (No Cheese) 
ROSA - Red Onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, AZ Pistachios 
SONNY BOY - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, Gaeta Olives 
BIANCOVERDE - Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula 
WISEGUY - Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage 

Of all of them, the Biancoverde was my absolute favorite! I don't eat pork, so I couldn't sample them all, but I'd happily order this one again. In fact, my team is returning next week for another team dinner for the coming Phoenix trip, and I will for sure be ordering this.

Their house draft beer is also quite tasty!

Any restaurant with the sort of hype this place has is just waiting to disappoint. I was especially skeptical since, after spending a summer in Italy, I haven't been able to find any pizza that rivals a true Italian pie. So, Saturday night, I braced myself for a super long wait to get some good (not great) pizza.

Boy, was I pleasantly surprised. To start, the weather could not have been more beautiful. We've finally gotten a little taste of Fall! I'm sure it will be yanked away before we know it and we'll have to endure a little bit more summer, but this weekend was glorious. Sitting on the front patio of Bar Bianco while waiting for a table was anything but a ""wait"". It was a great time, with good drinks and friends! To those of you who stand around in a drab lobby for an hour to eat at Olive Garden and then complain about a ""two hour wait"" at this cute bar, you're insane.

On to dinner. Oh my. Our table had two Margherita, one Wiseguy and one Rosa. Each was amazing in their own way, but the sausage on the Wiseguy was incredible and everything about the Rosa was perfect. You have got to try these two. I think I may have dreamt about the Rosa that night... Onion and parmesan and PISTACHIOS!

This is on my list of places I absolutely have to visit whenever I'm home from college. No matter how long the wait, and I've waited from 1 to 3 1\/2 hours, I never regret it. If the wait is really long, go next door to Bar Bianco and get some drinks and some of their fantastic olives or other finger foods. I've always found the service to be speedy once we're in, and the waiters are always friendly.

The first dilemma I always face upon making decisions at Pizzeria Bianco is whether to order the antipasto or the mozzarella tomato basil salad. The antipasto is always wonderful, featuring delicious local, seasonal, roasted and marinated vegetables and some awesome sorpressata and cheese. But then the salad has delicious local tomatoes, hand made mozzarella, nice olive oil and basil from the garden that grows outside of the restaurant. Usually if I'm not especially itching for the salad, I ask the waiter what vegetables are in the antipasto for the day, and that usually makes my decision. Both are always awesome.

Then comes the big decision. Which pizza. At this point, I've had the Margherita, Rosa, Sonny Boy and Wiseguy. I'm having a hard time picking a favorite, but I most often find myself ordering the Margherita, mostly because of its elegant simplicity. The tomato sauce is perfectly tart, the basil and mozzarella is delicious, and the crust is perfectly burnt on the edges. My least favorite is probably the Rosa, mostly because I'm not that big of a fan of parmigiano reggiano and it seems pretty dry. But the fennel sausage and onion on the Wiseguy and the salami on the Sonny Boy... I can't make up my mind. They're all too good. I might just have to keep going back to make my decision...",1,0,0

After many years of not wanting to wait in the legendary 3 hour line for Bianco I decided to try it brave it and take an out of town friend to this famous pizzeria. It was a Wednesday night, about 6:30pm. We walked in and got a table immediately. Has the hype died down or did we just get lucky? Anyway, apparently Wednesday is a good night to go.

We ordered the market salad which was arugula with apples, goat cheese and a wine vinaigrette and a margherita pizza to share. The salad was delicious. Fresh ingredients, not too much dressing and the perfect amount for two to share. Following that came the pizza. It was good but honestly not that great. I was expecting to be wowed. I wanted to bite in and say ""holy crap is this good."" Instead I bit in and thought ""yeah, it's pretty good."" My out of town friend who had never even heard of the place (or the hype) agreed. Maybe if you wait for three hours it does taste amazing because by that time you're starving and any pizza would taste like the best pizza ever. I was just glad we didn't wait that long for pizza that was just good.

Don't get me wrong, I liked it. Overall I'd say the food was good but not worth all the hype. The salad was more memorable than the pizza. For a similar style pizza I'd recommend La Grande Orange instead.",4,1,1

We live in Chicago and have been in the pizza business for over 20 years, so I suppose we were expecting more. The crust was soggy but the ingredients were fresh, which was good.

So finally, on my b-day weekend, my girlfriend Abby treated me to Pizzeria Bianco, a place she been wanting to try out for a while as well. 

As I'm sure many of the reviews probably already note, this place is now open for lunch. We went about 1:30 pm on a Friday and were able to grab a seat right away at the bar. The place stayed busy the whole time, even when we left at 3:00 pm, but you wouldn't have to wait more than a couple minutes for a table. 

I started out with one of their draft beers, not too impressed so I switched to San Tan on the next one. I loved the coziness of the place, and completely understand why there would be such a long wait in the evenings. 

I had the Wiseguy pizza and Abby had the Sonny Boy. Over all pretty good. I think we were both expecting to have some light shine down on us from heaven and the bartender bust out some harps as we took our first bite. The pizza was good, and in any other place I would be overly impressed but I think the years of hype stole away some of the pizza's thunder. I actually like La Bocca Urban Pizzeria better. Hope that don't break any of your hearts hearing that.

Everyone should go at least one time. I wouldn't mind coming back again as well, I wish I could go before Suns games. I could probably add my name to the list before the game and get seated after!

It has been almost a year since I went there for the first time and I am finally so sick and tired of hearing people praise this establishment that I finally feel the need to speak up.  Let me describe this horrific experience for you...

First we arrived an hour prior to it's opening because we had heard how busy it would be.  My boyfriend and I were about the 9th or so in line when it began to rain.  Not just a light drizzle, but pour down like the clouds ripped open and dumped everything they had on us.  Since the mesh netting that they have hanging over there outside table and chairs serves ZERO purpose we were all forced into the bar next door.  And by bar I mean walk-in closet sized room that only served a small selection of over priced beer and wine that was busting at the seams with 15 people inside.  I literally felt like a sardine in a tin can.  When we finally made our way out of the over packed room we did enjoy watching the rain fall on the patio.  

The time had come and the pizzeria opened their doors to a crowd eager to get out of the wet and cold and chow down on some delicious pies.  Boy were we about to be disappointed.  In our quest to keep dry we had met a guy traveling across the country that really wanted to try as many places as he could that he had seen on food network.  In fact he had stayed an extra day in Phoenix just to try Biancas.  We all decided that we should eat together if for no other reason then to save space and allow another group to get a seat in the 9 table restaurant.

We decided on 3 pizzas all together.  The Rosa, the Wiseguy, and the Biancoverde.  Upon ordering we were reminded that we weren't eating any red sauce pizzas but we were pretty confident with our choices so we went on ahead.  The pizzas arrived and while they did appear delicious, their taste was something quite different.  The rosa was completely bland.  It tasted like nothing but grease.  Definately the worst of the 3.  I thought the Biancoverde was alright but definately missing something (tomato sauce).  When I asked if I could have some I was immediately replied to with NO and the server just walked away.  She then told the chef what I asked for and he proceeded to stare at me with this ""stupid american"" look.  HELLO!!!  I went to dinner in america.  If I want a side of tomato sauce to help choke down YOUR monstrosity then you should JUST GIVE IT TO ME!!!  I am paying for this extremely over rated garbage.  

We left disappointed, sopping wet, and grateful that a pizza hut was right down the street from us because I would call there before we will EVER return to Pizzeria Bianco.  Oh and did I mention that my boyfriend also had the WORST case of food poisoning for 36 hours after we ate there.  What a freaking waste of time, money, and what could have been a good meal somewhere else.",0,3,0

Pizza has always been one of my favorite foods and has recently become one of my obsessions after visiting Naples this summer. I have found some amazing people within the states most notably in the Bay Area, Southern California and Chicago, but was simply blown away by the perfection that is Pizzeria Bianco.

I came here on a Friday afternoon and there was no wait for a table of five. We sat down and were super excited to sample some of the best pizza in America.

I started off with a salad consisting of fresh mozzarella, basil, olive oil and tomatoes. It is probably impossible to make that list of ingredients taste bad and this salad did not disappoint. Everything worked perfectly together. The salad was light, so fresh and so damn good.

I had to order the margherita pizza because that's the best way to judge a place I feel. The pizza came out piping hot and it was absolutely beautiful. The crust was for sure a clear highlight. It had a beautiful char and a great chew to it. The combination of sauce, fresh mozzarella and basil made this easily one of the best pizzas I have ever had. So amazing.

I also tried a few slices of the Rosa pizza and that thing blew me away. The combination of onions, paremesan reggiano and arizona pistachios was a flavor I had never experienced. The pizza was rich and so ridiculously flavorful. It was one of the best specialty pizzas I have ever had.

I came into Pizzeria Bianco with insanely high expectations and I believe the restaurant exceeded them.

I have to say, I don't really understand the long waits. There are so many places in midtown and downtown that are better and less expensive.

The pizza was good, not great. Salad was a little meh, although the bread and oil were amazing. Don't get me wrong, we enjoyed our meal I just don't think it's worth all the hype. Or expense. I didn't see the bill but I'm guessing for three of us it was about $100 bucks and that's just silly.

So much so that when I got back from the restroom with my son our table was occupied by another people.  I had to say something.  My waiter seemed to give 2 shits.

Now on to the pizza.  Very thin, super crisp burned spots on top.  Sauce was good but very plain.  Over all I make better pizza at home.  No fucking Joke.   This place is way beyond over hyped.

To finish it off another waiter took my plate with half a slice still on it and ran off.  Then dropped the check on the table with a get the fuck outta here attitude.

Yes, it does taste great, but I can't quite say that it's the most amazing pizza I've ever had.  But there is a reason why people do come here to eat - the glorified pizza experience!  It is kind of neat to see pizza dough being tossed up in the air and seeing the pizza go into the brick oven nearby!

We tried the Rosa pizza (red onion, pistachios, parmigiano, rosemary), but felt that it needed an extra add on.  So for an extra $6, on top of the $15 for the pizza itself, prosciutto was added on the pizza = $21.  This is a thin crust, flat type of pizza.  This can easily be shared with 2 people or 3 if you're a bird eater or with a bird eater in your group.  

We managed to have room for dessert.  I can't remember what I had exactly, but I'm going to say it was a cheesecake.  Sorry...it's been awhile!  But I do remember having to wait.  The parking around the area is very limited.  Metered parking or valet is available.",2,1,1

We arrive to an hour and a half wait (which we expected with 5 people) and enjoyed some drinks in the bar next door as we waited. The bartender was excellent and the atmosphere was great which was really the highlight of the visit.

When we sat down I was surprised at how small the dining room is, but I guess it explains the continual waiting list. A small room isn't a problem unless you pack too many table in so that there is no room for your server to do his job without continually bumping your chair\/elbow\/table\/head, which is exactly the case here. Our server was very attentive and nice but he just didn't have enough space to properly serve the table. 

We ordered salads and some pizzas to share and the salads were very salty. Quite strange to have a salad with that much salt, and I've never experienced it at another restaurant. The pizzas were all very underwhelming too. Don't get me wrong, they weren't bad, just average. I had much better pizza a few blocks to the west although I don't remember the name of the place.

I discovered that they have new hours! Monday through Saturday, 11 a.m. through 10 p.m. The new hours meant no more standing in line for one to two hours before getting seated, at least if you don't arrive during rush. We drove up at just after 4 p.m. and the place was only half full. By the time we left (around 5:30), there may have been one or two seats left at the bar. 

I was wondering whether the lack of anticipation and having to ""work"" for your pizza by standing patiently in line was going to affect my appraisal of it. That is, whether my rave reviews were biased by the fact that after two hours in line, steadily drinking, anything would have tasted great.

Nope, the pizza is as awesome as ever. Right now, this is my favorite pizza in the US, all styles considered. If I only had one pizza to eat for the rest of my life, Bianco's would be it. The dough (centerpiece of a pizza for me) is amazing. Light, delicate flavorful crust with a hint of sour and black flecks of char from the oven. Judicious use of quality ingredients.

For starters, they now have longer hours so you can take in this place for lunch, dinner, or a mid-afternoon meal.  We came here for lunch around Noon on a Saturday and didn't have to wait long for a spot inside.  Second, they now have dessert offerings.  Today I had their flourless chocolate cake and it was unquestionably the best flourless chocolate cake I've ever had.  Smooth, rich, velvety texture that is easily sharable.  The one thing that hasn't changed much are the pizzas.  The pizzas choices are limited, but good and are made in the same brick oven that has garnered worldwide acclaim for years.  Today my family and I split a margherita, a wise guy (a white pizza with sausage, mozzarella & onion), and a biancoverde (a white pizza with three different cheeses and arugula).  All had great clean texture and a crispy crust.

Bianco is a Phoenix institution and now has locations in central Phoenix and soon will be opening a location in Tucson.  With good reason.  It's good pizza.  But despite the hype and the accolades, I still can't declare this the best pizza I've had in AZ.  That title still belongs to Pomo just down the road in Downtown Phoenix.  In my own humble opinion, Cibo and Bianco are pretty evenly matched, but Pomo is just a step above.

That said, Bianco has a great product and (as long as you're okay waiting in line for awhile) is worth trying at least once.  From the ambience of its historic downtown location, to the friendly servers and pizzailolos, Bianco definitely offers a unique experience.  Some of you might even find you like Bianco more than the other local titans I mentioned.  Just be sure to pack your patience when you ask for a table.",1,0,1

But first: Get this straight: I was drug down here against my will. I had no desire to wait 2+ hours for ANY pizza, never mind one that's served with a side of attitude (that was what I expected after reading all the reviews).

Here's what I learned. 

The place next door (also owned by the Bianco's) has a good selection of wine, beer, bottled waters and soda. None of the ""Big 3"" breweries either, to my relief. Nice micro stuff. It's small. It's much cooler than standing outside. It's easy to spend a bunch of money while you wait for the restaurant to call over and let you know your table is ready. Note that you still have to stand in line initially to get ""on the list"" for Pizza seating, but you can send someone in to get beverages and tables while someone stands in line next door.

Pizzeria itself is small (obvious from the other reviews n'est pas?). Our wait staff was quick and friendly - no troubles with the hostess either. 

Food is awesome, although I don't think the mozzarella is ""all that"" like some would have you believe. After all -fresh mozzarella is pretty easy to make yourself. Google it, if you don't believe me. 

Anyway, we all 4 had different pizzas. I went Margherita with garlic because I didn't want my thin crust all weighed down with stuff - I wanted to see what the place really had as far as sauce and crust, so that's really the best way to go. Others loaded up. All were extremely satisifed. 

Was it worth 2 hours and $150+ between pizza, apps and drinks? That's a hard call, and the reason I gave this 4 stars...which I really wanted to be 3.75 but Yelp doesn't do fractions. Now, to check out Grimaldi's and see if their simulated NY water machine makes any difference to AZ water and its inclusion in a dough.",2,0,1

First off, it's in a rather difficult to get to spot.  It's on a pedestrian walkway near the Arizona Science Center... I could have sworn it was on some sort of campus, but whatever it is, it's blocked off from street traffic.  My girlfriend and I had to look for parking for about 20 minutes, and walked 4 blocks at 1pm on a Tuesday, which I thought was kind of absurd.  Not necessarily the restaurant's fault, just saying. 

So... yes, this is a traditional wood-fired pizza place, close to actual Italian pizza, and not the thick chewy Americanized dough many of us are used to.  What that will mean is, thin pizza, possibly burned in patches on the bottom, little cheese, little toppings, and small selection of ingredients.  From what I can remember, the menu is almost entirely their 5 different styles of pizza, and 3 or 4 salads and a few other appetizers.   There was complimentary bread and olive oil, which was crusty and tasty. My date and I ordered a caprese salad and the margherita pizza, which was a mistake on our part because the margherita is basically just the same ingredients as the caprese salad on top of bread, and cooked, so our meal was a little redundant. It wasn't bad, but nothing I would write home about. 

Depending on your personal taste, this could be a plus or minus.  It's a small room, with what little seating there is set very closed together.  We could hear the entire conversation of the couples on either side of us.  Service dragged a little, and our waters were only filled once our pizza came out.  We were in a hurry to catch a flight, and they obliged us by bringing our check and a to-go box out in a timely fashion, so I suppose I'll give them points for that. 

All in all, very ""meh"" and comparable to any other brick oven type pizza place.",1,0,0

This probably isn't a common thing, but my friend found a bug in her pizza that was probably thrown on with the vegetable toppings. By this time, we've all grown a little frustrated with this place. If you get a bug-free pizza, it's great. 

PRICE: A little expensive for pizza standards, but nothing that will have you digging deep into your wallet. Beware, the drinks do NOT come with free refills, including soft drinks. I spent around $15. 

SERVICE: The absurd wait for a table is what's keeping me from going to Pizzeria Bianco more often. Be prepared to wait a couple hours for a table, unless you make a reservation weeks in advance. The hours of operations of this place are laughable, only a couple hours each night, and are closed for at least one day out of the week. I wasn't too impressed with the service. The waiter failed to mention that soft drinks do not come with free refills.

Visiting the Phoenix,Arizona area, I heard from my family that this was a the spot to be at, but unfortunately reservations were few and far between, and waiting time is anywhere between 3-4 hours long. Wow, that long for pizza? Eh...I think not.  If you have been following me, I'm not even that much of a pizza fan.  

But, they twisted my arm, and not one to turn down a new place, I agreed.    We drove to downtown Phoenix and got there around 4 pm in the afternoon.  This restaurant is situated in a little square, it looking more like a wooden house with other businesses situated in that square with the same décor and landscape.  We were told that the wait time was about 4 hours long.  Wow, no kidding, is this a joke?  Okay April, be a good sport.  The group agreed to wait, and we decided to go around the other little nearby pubs.  

First spot was the pub across the way.  Although I'd never been to England, this seemed like an upscale pub that belonged across the pond.  Very homey and warm, it had a brown décor and accompanying fireplace.  Place is small, but quaint, and lots of beers on tap.  One hour spent here

Second spot was the wine bar situated kitty corner to the pub. Same size as the pub, but décor was different, with more of a modern feel and touch.  We had some appetizers, and some wine. All equally good, and it tided us over to our well anticipated meal.  They have a nice selection of wine, and staff are eager to give their recommendations. Another hour spent here.

Third spot was area directly outside of Pizzeria Bianco.  They had very long wooden picnic tables, and above us were white lights strung up.  There were bushes and lots of greenery, and I later found out from a Foodnetwork special, that the chef keeps his garden out here to ensure fresh quality items.  Magnificent! Yet another hour spent here....

Final spot was Pizzeria Bianco.  We started off with some caprese salad, and with the size of our group, ordered 2.  It was THE BEST caprese salad ever, the mozzarella clearly fresh and maybe made homemade, and the tomatoes weren't mushy, just the right texture.  The drizzed balsamic was not too tart, and had the preferred amount of olive oil, also drizzled

For pizzas, we ordered everything on their menu.  But the two that stand apart are the Rosa, with crushed pistachios and red onion, it had both a nice bite and a nice kick.  The second was the Wiseguy with onion, mozerella and fennel sausage.  Phenomenal! The sausage had a great savory flavor, leaving you satisfied, but not like you stuffed yourself silly with a Chicago deep dish.  I'm still trying to find that type of sausage in Chicago. No luck yet.  

Come here for the ambience and food.  It is definitely worth the wait, as it will spark up some rather interesting conversations during your long, but very worthy visit.",0,0,0

Of course, as you can see based on my rating, Pizzeria Bianco surprisingly lived up to my expectations and then some. 

I came to Phoenix as part of a family vacation, but we only had a couple of hours to spend in the city before we had to leave. Although my family generally despises waiting for a table at a restaurant (any wait time over 20 minutes usually means we look for a different restaurant), I managed to persuade them to wait at Pizzeria Bianco because, well, we had come all the way from New Jersey and would probably not be coming back to Phoenix anytime soon. Of course, since we were in Phoenix on a Friday evening in mid-June, there was a pretty long line and wait time even when we arrived at 9 pm. We didn't get seated until nearly 11 pm, making for the longest wait my family had ever endured for a table at a restaurant. 

Based on the reviews I had read, I decided to order one each of the Rosa (Parmigiano Reggiano, Red Onion, Arizona Pistachios), Sonny Boy (Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Salami, Gaeta Olives), and Wiseguy (Wood Roasted Onion, Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage) to share between four people. First off, let me say that the crust on all of the pizzas we shared was absolutely phenomenal. There was a really nice char on the crust, and somehow, the crisp crust maintained a level of pliancy which I did not think was possible. This was my first experience with Neapolitan-style pizza, so unfortunately, my experience here at Pizzeria Bianco may have set the bar exceedingly high for my future visits to Neapolitan-style pizzerias. While I generally favor meat toppings, I was astounded to discover that the Rosa was my favorite pie among the three we had ordered. Everything about the pie - the sharp bite of the Parmigiano Reggiano, the sweetness of the red onion, and the crunch and nuttiness of the pistachios - worked harmoniously to create a pizza that was greater than the sum of its parts. I was absolutely blown away by how delicious this pie was, and I wish I had ordered another Rosa for myself. I thought the Wiseguy was extremely good as well. The combination of sausage, onion, and mozzarella made for a more conventional flavor profile, though it was by no means ordinary. As for the Sonny Boy, I thought it was quite salty; of the three pies, I thought this one was the least successful, as the salt content from the salami and olives seemed to overwhelm the pie.

So do I think that Pizzeria Bianco serves up the greatest pizza in the country? I really don't know, as I certainly have not eaten at many of the nation's top pizzerias. However, I will say that the pizzas from Pizzeria Bianco are delicious and are most definitely worthy of all of the praise and acclaim showered upon them. Despite the ridiculous wait time, I believe that Pizzeria Bianco's pizzas are worth waiting for (well, I'd wait up to 2 hours; I doubt that there's any food that I'd wait 4 hours for, regardless of how good it may be). If you are ever in the Phoenix area, definitely make a point of stopping by to try it for yourself.",0,1,1

Came here after viewing the solar eclipse at the Arizona Science Center.  There was a huge crowd waiting outside 30 minutes the place had even opened.  The staff waited til exactly 11:00AM to open their doors.  Once they did, they immediately sat me down and took my order.

Now, I DON'T like pizza.  I don't know why or how, but there's just something about pizza that just doesn't taste right.  I think it might have something to do with the sauce (or maybe not.. because I do like lasagna and spaghetti).  But I decided to give this place a chance and sucked it up and ordered a pizza.

My waitress was super friendly.  When I asked her about two different pizzas and which one was better, she said they were both great and suggested that I order 1\/2 and 1\/2 if I couldn't decide.  I ended up getting the Sonny Boy and Wise Guy.

I sat at the bar, so it was nice seeing the chefs make my pizza, put it into the oven, and take it out. All of the ingredients they used were FRESH.  Both pizzas were really good - much better than any pizza I've ever had, but nothing toooooo special. The crust was DELICIOUS though! Each of the pizza slices were HUGE and hefty.  I liked Sonny Boy much more than I liked Wise Guy -- too many onions!

I'd definitely come here again. I'd love to try all of their other dishes, especially their small plates.  One thing to note: this place is popular and it's relatively small.

After all is said and done, if we had waited more than a few minutes to get in, we would have killed someone who HYPED this place up! 

The menu was VERY limited and heaven forbid if you wanted an Antipasto-that was available ONLY after 5 PM. Oh, is it the oven that the pizza is baked in that causes the HYPE?

Of course, I'm pretty biased towards loving my New York style thin-crust pizzas but I decided to give it a try. 

My friend Rachael and I arrived at around 5:30 pm hoping to catch the Suns game (about 5 blocks away!) at 8 pm. My friend from New York had warned me about the wait time, but when we arrived, we saw no line and found that it wasn't terribly crowded inside. However, once we got in and put our name down, we found out the wait was 2.5 hours! The hostess kindly suggested we go to the bar next door while Rachael and I debated back and forth whether or not to wait that long for pizza. 

Anyways, we ended up going to Bar Bianco right next door (brilliant idea to have this place open next door) and waited for our turn. We were called about 7:45 pm (2 hour and 15 minute wait). We ordered the Margherita pizza - $11 (tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil) and Biancoverde -$14 (Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula - aka lots of cheese). The Margherita was perfect with the right amount of tomato sauce\/basil taste and the Biancoverde was good up to the second slice where it might have just been a tad bit more cheese than I can take in all in one night. 

Thumbs Up: price (relatively cheap - we spent about $30 for both of us with two pizzas including tip!), quality, staff was very friendly, and lastly - probably the best pizza i have ever had in my life.

My boyfriend and I had spent the day in downtown Phoenix, and decided to give Bianco a try. We got there a little after 4, and were 12 and 13th in like respectively (it was a weekday.) We were in the first group seated, which was a relief after the August heat.

Although I was braced for serious rudeness, the service was polite, and one of the waiters was willing to take a moment to explain the menu, which I appreciated.

We ordered the Margherita and the Rosa. The Margherita wasn't bad. I mean, it was cheese pizza with some basil leaves. Edible, certainly, but by no means a revelation. The Rosa, on the other hand, was awash in olive oil. It was massively greasy, almost to the point of being inedible.

I don't know if it was the people in the building, or the building itself, but the acoustics were terrible - my boyfriend and I could barely hear each other.

One of the two of us who contributed to this review is of 100% Italian heritage and grew up in an Italian neighborhood in NY. Pizzeria Bianco was recommended to us by another couple who are long time friends, who used to live in Paradise Valley and who ate at Bianco frequently. They are ""foodies"" whose judgement in food we trust and the husband is also a native New Yorker with 100% Italian heritage. So, when they highly recommended Bianco, we were looking forward to great pizza. And since great pizza is among the world's most perfect food, we didn't even mind the long wait we knew would be a part of eating at Bianco. 

BUT...well, we felt completely duped by this experience. 

The pizza just was not that good. And it certainly wasn't good enough to justify the nearly two hour wait for a table. Even if that wait was made easier by being able to sit outside on a lovely Arizona evening while enjoying a good glass of wine from the wine bar next door and getting to meet a nice family of New Yorkers, also with Italian heritage, who had come all the way from Queens to try Pizzeria Bianco. 

We went in for our table ahead of them. On our way out, as they were eating their pizzas and we had finished ours, the father gestured with a big ""thumbs down"" and we said we agreed. 

I guess it made us feel better because we felt very much like the little boy in the story of the Emperor who has no clothes who, while all others are admiring the Emperor's finery, cries out ""But he's nude!"" 

The good news is the salad that started off the meal was delightfully fresh and dressed just right with a lovely vinaigrette. The pizza itself was just not ""all that""...the crust was OK but burned on the outside edges. Not burned as in nicely charred, burned as in incinerated. We've had lots of good wood fired pizzas and this is not a ""requirement"". Toppings were minimal, which is a good thing to let the crust shine when the crust is great, but in this case there was just too little topping. And the poor, harried waitstaff acted as if they were doing diners a favor to let us eat there. 

All in all, we're glad we tried this one time to simply experience first hand a place that was getting so much hype. But with so many really great dining options, including pizza, in the greater Phoenix area we won't be back here during our upcoming visit. Fool us once, shame on you, fool us twice...",10,3,2

I feel the same way about this as I feel when I tell people I hate the Beatles and they look at me like I just ran over their dog..... 

I am the type of guy who loves ""an experience"" and from that standpoint, I can handle a very simple meal turning into a 4 or 5 hour process. That said, if I am set to do this, I expect to be completely dazzled with the outcome. When I got there at about 3:45 pm I was about number 35 in line. By 4:30, there were like 100 people in line. The anticipation was building and a strapped myself in for the wait next door. Unfortunately, this was the best part of the evening.

This is my dilemma, it's not that I hated it or thought it was bad in any way, However, the food was ok, definitely a place I would order pizza from and pick it up and take it home. I guess I just fail to see the ""genius"" of this pizza. We started with the spiedini and also ordered a Sonny Boy, Good Fella and the Arugula pizza. Again, it was all good, dough, cheese, meats and veggies. All good ingredients, but seriously, I don't get the big deal. This is not your typical pizza joint pizza which is a good thing, but in my opinion as someone who is a complete pizza nut who eats way too much of it all around the country, I've had better in my opinion.... Oh, I must complement the wait staff, particularly Dave the waiter. Great waiter and friendly as can be.

Maybe my expectations were set too high. I expected to love it so much that I wanted to eat until I exploded... I didn't. A couple years ago I was in NY on business and I walked over the Brooklyn Bridge and ate at Patsy Grimaldis under the bridge. Now that experience left me thinking ""HOLY CRAP THAT WAS AWESOME""...

No one thought this came close to being a quality dining experience.  A 7pm reservation for 11 people meant that we were shuttled over to an adjoining building to wait, where one glass of house wine was $13, which immediately set the wrong tone, along with the wait.  The reason given for the wait was to be sure the group had all arrived, despite the fact that everyone had arrived prior to 7pm; the real reason is to get more money out of everyone waiting,  through excessive wine prices.  Bad customer service.   At 7:15 someone came to the waiting room and said our table was ready; everyone marched over to the restaurant to find out that our 7pm reservation was still not ready.  Bad customer service.  Back at the waiting room we asked for menus so we could make our food selections while waiting.  We were told that they had only one menu for everyone in the waiting room (others were waiting besides our group also).  Bad customer service.  Finally at 7:30 I went back to the restaurant  to check on our table and was told at the door that the table was ready, a fact we had to find out on our own.  Bad customer service.  We were seated at several small tables pushed together in the corner, not in a separate room as I had been led to believe over the phone.  Bad customer service.  Extremely cramped; noise level so high that conversation was difficult.  Drinks were brought, and I had to insist we were ready to order, not wait. The pizzas came out fairly fast.  Mediocre.  Thin crusts that were more like dried out crackers-a smear of tomato sauce with no distinctive flavor-some cheese.  The much-praised quality was simply not there, and this assessment was shared by all the other members of our party.  Some mentioned how much better Humble Pie is for pizza; others mentioned Grimaldi's.  I asked for separate checks, as I had requested over the phone when making the reservation.  Absolutely not.  Bad customer service.  We left, with no one planning to ever return or recommend  the restaurant.  Due to non-distinctive pizza, lack of customer service, high noise level, and cramped seating, this restaurant is vastly over-rated, and it is another mystery of marketing that this establishment has created the unwarranted hype that it has.",1,0,0

I used to live in the Phx area, and had squandered a few opportunities to go. The wait was not a deterrent, since I have waited to try other restaurants in the past. 

Ignore the fact that I am from Chicago, because that didn't factor into this review. Comparing deep dish pizza to a thinner east coast style of pizza doesn't make much sense. 

That being said, we got there late afternoon on a Saturday, and we got right in.....to put our name on the list for a 2 hour wait. We took a quick walk across the street to the bar that has more than beer and wine, because i wanted neither. After some minor drinking and an appetizer, and some less than enjoyable conversation from my ""new friends"", we went back over, 15 minutes short of finally being sat at a table.

We sat down, and i received the highlight of my meal. A Bubble Up. For those that don't know, this is pretty much Sprite made from real cane sugar. After I guzzled down my Bubble Up, my Pizza promptly arrived (Margherita with Fennel Sausage and Basil).

I looked for the biggest slice, and dug in. Although it was decent, it doesn't warrant the wait, and to say this pizza is nationally ranked is laughable. I would have been just as satisfied at Sbarro's. I would put this behind the likes of Grimaldi's and Grazie.

4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

This really is one of the finest pizza places in the country for a Neopolitan-style pizza.  Full disclosure, I've already mentioned in another review that my wife and I are disciples of the Chris Bianco school of cooking (see review for Tratto):  simple food prepared well, letting natural flavors speak for themselves through excellent ingredients, local sourcing, etc.

My wife would kill, KILL a person, to get the bread service with olive oil.  I wouldn't go that far, it is good, but this is her favorite part of the meal.

We've tried everything on the menu.  4 stars for everything not a pizza.  The pizza bumps it up to 5.

The following, in my opinion, are the best pizzas from best to weakest:
Margherita
Rosa
Sonny Boy
Biancoverde
Wiseguy
Marinara

A pizza doesn't have to have meat to make it a superior pizza.  Balance between the crust and the toppings to the sauce (if there is one), along with flavor of the individual toppings themselves.  The interplay between cheese and crust, I'm salivating already.  

His sauce is well-balanced, the cheese has nice drag and chew.  The blistered crust.  

Yes, the wait could be long.  Just grab a drink next door and stop complaining.  You should be happier coming in buzzed and hungry rather than just hungry.

It's been awhile!  Me and my wife came here about 4 years ago and left a bit disappointed.  Fast forward to present day.......  We had an employee appreciation day at work, and we got to play a hand of blackjack with our boss.  If you won, you got to pick an envelope with a prize in it.  I was lucky and won my hand with a 21!  My envelope that I picked was ""Lunch with the boss"".  We could pick the place where we wanted to go, so I decided to choose here.  Me, him, his assistant and one other coworker who won all headed down here today.  I figured that it was time for a return visit and since work was paying, might as well head somewhere nice that everyone would enjoy.  This place is consistently ranked as one of the top pizzerias in the USA and the other 3 people I went with had never been. 

We drove down, valet parked ($3.00) and were in the doors right around 11:30.  There were only a few other people there and we got a table right away.  We all took a quick look at the menu and then placed our order.  My last time here, I sampled the Margherita, The Rosa and The Sonny Boy.  Today, I went with The Wiseguy.  I had that and a Diet Coke to drink. Here is how everything was............

Wiseguy Pizza-  This thing was fantastic!  This pizza is a white pizza with no tomato sauce.  It came topped with lots of sausage, plenty of onions and a nice amount of  smoked mozzarella.  The sausage was sliced thin and had a great texture and taste with the fennel in it.  The onions were the perfect middle between soft yet still firm enough to have some bite.  The cheese was awesome too..cant beat a fresh homemade mozzarella!.  This was one of the better white pizzas I have ever had.  Biancos crust is always really thin, but today it seemed just a tad thicker than past visits.  It had a perfect char on the crust without being burnt and it had a fantastic chew.  This particular pizza gets 5 stars.  If\/when I come back, it will be the only one I order!  It was great!

Diet Coke-  They serve this to you in a 12oz can.  Cost=$3.50.  Highway robbery!  Hey, at least the regular Coke is a Mexican Coke in a glass bottle and can somewhat be justified for a $3.50 beverage, but to charge $3.50 for a can of Diet Coke is outrageous!   

Service was good. Our waitress was nice.

Overall, I can take this off my ""Overrated List"" since the pizza I had today was absolutely fantastic.  But, even though my lunch today was both excellent and free, I still can't see myself coming down here and paying what equates to $25.00 for a pizza and a can of Coke. 4 pizzas and 5 sodas came out to $106.00 after tip!  Ben Franklin, Abraham Lincoln and George Washington all frowned as they were coming out of Brandy's wallet!   It was good, but not that good.  There are many other pizza joints in Phoenix that I would head to if I had to plunk down the cash for lunch.  With that said, the next time I win a prize or get a free lunch from work, I'm headed back here for another Wiseguy...it really is a great pizza and it was head and shoulders above every other pizza I have had from any of Biancos restaurants in the past.  I just wish you didn't have to take out a second mortgage to enjoy a meal here!  That's all, folks!    Catch you on the flipside, Pizzeria Bianco.  It's been real!",5,5,4

We were up in PHX for a Tuesday night concert just down the street from here. In our search for a place to eat, we noticed Pizzeria Bianco was nearby our destination. Having tried the Tucson location roughly 2 years ago (and having had a pretty bad experience), we thought we would give the original location a try. We are so glad we stopped in. For the two of us we got a table right away, near the oven so we could watch all the dough being tossed and the bustle of the two chefs. The place was busy for a Tuesday but not overly crowded. The building is simply and tastefully decorated. The servers were all extremely friendly and cheerfully prompt. 

We both ordered red wine and decided to just get one pizza. We chose the Wiseguy and added wood-fired mushrooms. A week later and I still remember every flavor and morsel of that pizza. Delectable. After the pizza was finished (it didn't take too long, even though we were savoring!), we got more wine and ordered some coffees and dessert. I ordered the rice pudding and my husband ordered the flourless chocolate cake. Both were wonderful, especially with coffees at the end, but I think if I were to do it again I would go for the chocolate cake by myself.

By the time we showed up we dwindled down to 10 and were sent to wait next door at the wine bar while they got our table ready (which was WAY better than waiting outside in the heat.)

After 10 minutes they came to get us for dinner, and once we got inside I went to tell the hostess that we had lost two more, and she could take back a table and two chairs for other parties. She rolled her eyes and walked away without responding, which was kind of weird, but I wasn't going to let her attitude kill my vibe.

Our waiter was very cool, nice, and helpful. We ordered several pizzas and bottles of wine for the table. 

The pizza was delicious- I had the Margherita. It came out within 10 minutes of ordering.

Payment was really easy despite the several split checks we needed.

Bar Bianco next door opens an hour before The Pizzeria and waitresses serve you cold drinks and appetizers while you wait in line. (Not such a bad idea Mr. Bianco)

We were a table of 6 and were able to be seated on the first turn. I ordered a 'Wise Guy', wood roasted onion, smoked mozzarella and fennel sausage. After my first bite I summoned the waiter and ordered a second pizza. ""To go?"" He asks. ""No for right now!"" That first bite was like revelation. The crust was crispy but also light and airy almost like freshly made indian naan straight from a tandoor oven. The second pie 'Sonny Boy' was a blend of tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, salami and olives. 

I had made friends with a guy in line. He was from Italy and had just moved to the States. He said that this is the pizza that tastes the closest to what he grew up eating in Italy.

Since we are medical students we had plenty of notes to keep us busy. nonetheless, we decided to see what the wine bar was like next door and a couple of glasses of wine later we are all giggles and boy talk.  3 hours later (which is a bit too much in my final opinion) we were seated at the bar and promptly ordered.   We shared an appetizer, spiedini (Italian fontina wrapped in prosciutto with arugula greens) and it was fantastic!! the cheese was perfectly melted and cut by the salty prosciutto and peppery arugula.  As for the pizzas, we each ordered a pizza knowing that we would have leftovers to take home.  I choose the Wise Guy mainly for the fennel sausage and it was worth it!

When she has a suggestion, we always listen).   I didn't make reservations since I figure ""it's a pizza place, why need ressies?""  OOPS! My bad!

We got to Pizzeria Bianco about 5:15P on a Thursday. After putting our names down we had wine, beer and crostini from bar bianco.
I was really amazed there weren't any hot heads complaining about the wait.  Everyone was pretty chill and mellow. I loved the atmosphere !
The 2.5 hour wait went by pretty fast. 

Anyways, definitely worth a stop if you have the time in Phoenix.  We had the tomato with mozzerlla, basil and olive oil. YUM!!!  We had another dish with prosciutto wrapped around cheese on skewers or somehing.   It was good, though it was too cheesey for me.  We ordered the margherita pizza, but we added garlic and salami (db wanted to add the salami).  I just removed the salami, but the pizza was sooooooooooo delish!!!

If you are in the downtown Phoenix area near the Arizona Science Center or Chase Field and want one of the best brick oven pizza's, you have to come here.

Street parking is difficult, valet parking is expensive, garage parking is bearable if you don't mind a short walk and get a parking validation ticket at the restaurant.

The entire building is brick with a nice lawn area with a long picnic table lined with fig trees. There is another building which they use as wet bar and waiting area. Get there early or expect to wait because this place is popular.

This is my second time to Pizzeria Bianco and the quality and service has not disappointed. We came a little before lunch time to beat the crowd and got a nice table in front of the brick oven which takes up a quarter of the restaurant. We decided to order just one pizza to share since we wanted to save room for other taste treats.

We ordered the Wiseguy which is originally one of their white pizza's, but with a tomato sauce. It's topped with roasted onions, fennel sausage and smoked mozzarella. All the ingredients were fresh and cooked to perfection. 

The menu is limited, but seasonal ingredients are often available. It's a bit pricey, but worth every penny. I'm not sure if I would recommend it if the wait is more than an hour in the middle of the summer.

This was probably the best pizza I've had outside Naples.

WAIT TIME - 3 HOURS:
-- AC and I arrived at 4pm on a Saturday afternoon.  Bianco opens at 5pm and there was already a good sized line.  Bar Bianco next door opens at 4pm, so you could go in and get drinks while you wait in line.  Some people even brought lawn chairs like they were out for a tailgate or a picnic.  Once the place opened and they started taking names they said it would be a 2 hour wait.
-- After wandering around downtown for a while we headed to Bar Bianco for some wine, apps, and a game of chess.  An excellent way to pass the time.
-- The staff at Bar Bianco came by and told us our table was ready, right about 7pm.  1hr to put our names in + 2 hours to wait = 3 hours total waiting time.

FOOD - OUTSTANDING:
-- Spiedini, $10 - Italian Fontina wrapped in Prosciutto di Parma, served warm.  What a way to start a meal!  Served on skewers, this is an amazing appetizer.  The cheese was melty without dripping everywhere and the warm prosciutto was excellent.
-- Salad, $6 - Local Organic Greens with Red Wine Vinaigrette.  Pretty standard, mixed green salad.
-- Margherita Pizza, $13 - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil.  This is why you come here, and it lived up to expectations.  The crust was perfectly chewy with a bit of char and flavor from the brick oven.  The crust alone would make a great dish.  The tomato sauce had the right amount of tang, wasn't too sweet, and they didn't drench the pizza in sauce.  The mozzarella was excellent and the basil was out of this world.  Better than anything you could grow in your own garden.
-- Salami and Olive Pizza, $16? - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, and Kalamata Olives.  There was no skimping on the toppings here.  First class, quality ingredients and plenty of it.  If you like cured meats this is the way to go.",1,0,0

It would totally be in the top 10 of an embarrassingly one-dimensional Stuff Lori Likes list: ""Waiting at least two hours, fueled by a jammy red, to eat some pizza at 10:00 at night"". Naturally, good company and a bowl of meaty olives are a given. Once, I showed up and there was no wait. I went next door first anyway. Call me crazy, but life goes by too fast. I like the wait. 

After an hour or two and some vino, the antipasto is a must for starters. Local seasonal veggies wood-roasted and drenched in olive oil, cured meat, olives, and some cheese; it doesn't get much better- except when gorgeous heirloom beets are on the platter. Nothing beats 'em (don't groan, it's impolite). 

The Neapolitan style wood-fired pizzas are gooey goodness, one and all. My personal faves are the Rosa (pungent aged cheese, grilled red onions, and pistachios), the Margherita with prosciutto, and the Wiseguy (smoked mozzarella, grilled onions and sliced fennel sausage). And yes, I named half the pizzas on the menu and they are all my favorites. 

Housed in an historic building, the atmosphere is rustic and homey. A little candlelight and an open kitchen make me feel like I'm at a friend's home for dinner - and in some ways I am. My first trip to Bianco was 13 years ago when my now husband took me for my 21st birthday; we've been going ever since.

Some family members and I met up downtown and were ready to be blown away by some incredible pizza!

We ended up waiting forever-- over two hours-- to get in. This wasn't a huge shock, so I won't really factor that into my review rating. It was a long wait, but we knew that it would be. However, it's what came after the long wait that disappointed us. Once we were finally in, it took forever for our order to come out. We were also split up into three separate groups even though our party wasn't that large. That's fine, too. They were busy and pretty packed, so I understand that.

The pizzas, though, were extremely unimpressive. Even my mother commented on how she did not really enjoy her pizza that much, especially when compared to previous experiences. My pizza was so unexciting that I don't even remember what I had ordered now, which is pretty uncommon for me! It wasn't disgusting, but it was so boring that I can't even recall eating it! I think this sentiment was shared amongst all of us that night. For the price and the hype, it just didn't live up to our expectations.

Me and a friend decided to go on a Saturday. The place opens at 5pm, and we got there at about 4:30pm. There were already about 25-30 people in front of us. Not too bad. We put our names down, and went next door to Bar Bianco. Bought a bottle of wine, and sat there drinking and talking. For some reason, time seems to fly by when you're drinking wine :) They came around and took our names down, said they'd let us know when our table was ready. That was nice, saved us the hassle of having to go check every 20-30 minutes.

So after a little over 2 hours our names were called and we headed over to the pizzeria. We were seated in the back, near the back door and right next to the oven. We could see Mr. Bianco making the pizza. Only took about 5 minutes for someone to come over to our table and take our order, and another 10-15 minutes for our pizza's to arrive. Wasting no time with appetizers, we headed straight for the main course.

Here is what we ordered, along with the review.

SONNY BOY (Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, Gaeta Olives)
Very unique taste. You can actually taste the olives, and they have a strong flavor. Not too strong as to overwhelm, but enough to appreciate and enjoy it. Salami was very good too. This is their version of pepperoni pizza.

BIANCOVERDE (Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula)
Wow, the cheese is just... wow. I could have eaten a bowl of just the cheese. The arugula also added a slight organic aftertaste. Legend has it they make the cheese fresh there everyday, and they have a garden where they pick their arugula.

WISEGUY (Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage)
The best of the three. Good grief, the onions are on another level! And the sausage is so juicy and flavorful. I will definitely order this one again when we go back to try the other 3 we still need to taste.

The crust on all three pizzas was thin enough to draw attention to the ingredients, but not too thin that it became soggy. When I picked up a slice, nothing fell off. But this isn't the kind of pizza where you eat the good stuff and leave the crust. The whole thing is the good stuff!
You could smell the wood that was used to smoke these pizzas when they get to the table.

Chris Bianco is a master of pizza. Scratch that, he's THE master of pizza. And he's fast too. If you search youtube for 'pizzeria bianco', there's a 1:11 clip of Chris making the pizza. There's also another good one of him on Jimmy Kimmel Live.

Here's the total cost for the evening:
Bottle of wine - $40.
3 Pizza's + Iced Tea - $51.

If you skip the wine, it's actually not that expensive, especially when you go with more people and split the bill. And on your way out, you're bound to get a ""Thanks for coming guys"" from the master chef himself. Will definitely be going back again, no question about it.",1,0,1

I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but if you don't want to wait for dinner, go at lunch.  We usually show up at 11:15 or 11:30 and wait no more that 15-20 minutes for a table.

Us: Ok, no problem.

Us: What's the ETA?
Hostess: You left?! (Weird shuffling and glancing at reservation list, no feedback)
Us: ...Uh yeah (thinking that it was 2 hours to kill).
Hostess: Keep waiting.

Despite 3 hours, this turned out to be a good spot for entertaining my out-of-town friend (especially since she loves pizza and is highly susceptible to hype). If it's not a hot night and you have a few downtown bars in your repertoire, you can make a good time of walking, talking, and relaxing during your wait. 

Personally, the pizza was too thin for my style (On one piece, it felt like my ingredients were touching me through the crust). However, my friend raved about how it was the best she'd ever had. Since I was entertaining her, I was really happy with the place.

Eh, not super-impressed. Maybe because its reputation is a lot to live up to. Their pizza is good, but very expensive. The dining area is small, and they only seat complete parties. If you have a straggler in your group, you will get bumped down the seating chart until they arrive. There is a bar in one of the buildings next door that serves wine and tapas for you to wait in the AC which is nice. It has a bigger seating area which makes me wonder why the restaurant and the bar can't just switch... The service here is good. They made a mistake on my pizza.

To those who complain about the wait: that's the allure of it all! 
I love the fact that Pizzaria Bianco forces you into the European style of dining out.  You're supposed to take it slow, have wonderful company with great conversations with people you may or many not know... America has fallen into this instant gratification mode of dining that they don't know how to enjoy dining out the way it was meant to be...

Get there at least an hour and half before they open at five.  It should place you very close to the first seating, if not, very soon. If you come after they've opened, expect a three hour wait.  The list of names fills up fast. 
They use an honor system so when you get there, ask who had just gotten there before you and see who gets there after you and your group. It's an honor system, so when they are about to open at five, just go find your place in line.  

During the wait, go next door to the bar because they open at four.  Order drinks and enjoy your company.   If you're unsure or uneasy, just send a member of your party next door to Bar Bianco for drinks & appetizers.

Everything was fresh and delicious.  
The margherita pizza is the best in my opinion.

Five of us, two appetizers, two bottles of wine, five pizzas came out to around 50 dollars a person, including the tip.

I think the ricotta is as well because of the very creamy consistency, almost like a burratta, unlike the store bought kind.  The spiciness of the arugula complemented the three cheeses.  Oh, and the crust...nothing compares to it.  I want an outdoor oven in my backyard...it's actually in my backorder list.    A glass of Pino Grigio for me and ice cold beer for the hubs.

The pizza here... Like nothing I've tried. The restaurant setting... so cool and hip yet romantic and city-like. I'm glad to say us Phoenicians have this local spot, which is located in the Heritage Square in DT Phx. I always love going to the DT Phx area and trying this place out just topped off the mood of the evening for my date and I! I saw this area while at the Matsuri Festival back in February, and I told myself I wanted to come back to sit on the patio of one of the restaurants in Heritage Square... When my date brought me here, I had no idea the location. 

They have fun lights that string across the patio connected to the actual restaurant building. It's the perfect spot on a perfect-weathered day, especially at night when those twinklies light up the area out front. The hostess was pretty friendly, halfway wheeling around on a scooter thing, looking like she had a broken leg - but that didn't stop her, she was full of energy! We were greeted by our server who was very helpful and friendly. He recommended a few pizzas to try and brought us some bread with our waters. I ordered a Moscato (as usual lately) that was just perfectly sweet and buttery with a tiny hint of bubbly. My date ordered a ""Very Dry"" Ginger Ale that came in a glass bottle that I've never heard of, and it was exactly as described... Very dry! But still very good if you like Ginger Ale!

We ordered the Handmade Mozzarella Salad that went great with the Sonny Boy pizza. The salad being not too overpowering really brought out the taste and flavors in the pizza! And who can go wrong with some greenery eats in their life?? The server was on top of everything, filling up empty water glasses and checking up on us. Come time to wrap things up, we didn't have room for dessert and the server was prepared just in case and placed our check down for us to pay. The price was very reasonable considering I also ordered a glass of wine. Our pizza was boxed up and ready to go by the time we paid and we didn't have to wait forever.

Overall, with the ambiance, good food, great location?.... These guys will definitely see me again!

Personally I don't mind the wait - which is much shorter on a Tuesday or Wednesday.  But anything less than 2 hours is almost unheard of, so be prepared.  This place is a destination restaurant and def brings out Phoenix's own Bridge and Tunnel crowd (West Valley, East Valley, Ahwatukee, oh my).

On my most recent visit, my wife and I met my friend from out of town along with his wife and daughter.  My friend has had pizza all over the U.S. (especially New York\/New Jersey area) as well as Italy since his entire family is Italian.  Since he lives in New Mexico, he judges all other pizza places against a restaurant called Farina.  Everywhere he goes, he orders a simple margherita and compares it against Farina's margherita.  My wife does the same and she makes excellent pizza at home (hand roll thin crust from scratch, fresh herbs from our garden, and in the past she even blanched tomatoes to make sauce from scratch).  

My friend rated the pizza here close to the same level of Farina and I would agree.  These are two of the best pizza places in all of the United States.  The seating is very limited both inside and outside.  I would recommend using the valet parking if you have a nice car (for $3 and piece of mind) and getting here early.  We arrived at 4:30PM and put our names down for five people.  There was a small market happening nearby so we passed the time by walking around and checking out various booths before returning to the restaurant around 5PM.  My friend arrived at 5:15PM and our table was ready by the time he arrived.  We were quoted an hour to an hour and a half wait, but I think many of the guests eating here are very considerate to try and finish their meals quickly knowing the line outside to get in is very long.  We'll definitely have to check out their second location near the Biltmore area.

We ordered margherita pizzas and his wife (gluten free) had salad and an appetizer sampler plate.  The pizzas were excellent though the sauce could have used a few Italian spices (rosemary, oregano, thyme, and basil).  It tasted like it was home made (blanched tomatoes) with a hint of sweetness just the way we like it.  The thin crust was perfection and you can really tell they use fresh mozzarella cheese and the basil probably came out of their spice garden just outside the restaurant.  I like my thin crust to have a slightly burnt taste\/portion and they delivered on this (though not too burnt).  I like my pizza spicy so liberally sprinkled red pepper flakes all over each slice with a little bit of parmesan cheese as well.

For dessert, we shared an order of biscotti.  My friend and his wife had wine and it came out to $100 including tip for four people.  My wife and I often share margherita pizzas and we only drink water so if we ate alone it probably would have been $18 including tip for two people.

With that and the multitude of positive yelp reviews I had to try it for myself. 

We pulled into the valet and handed off the keys. When we walked in I realized how small the place was. Maybe 30 people can fit in total. We saw the hostess and were told that the wait for our part of 3 would be a hour 30. We were then told that they had a wine bar next door we could wait at. The review for the bar is separate but suffice to say I liked it. When our time had come someone came and let us know that we were up. We had to sit at the bar but at least we were in. 

We sat down at the bar bringing our drink for the previously mentioned bar. Now I'll new brief with the actual review. 

Service was 2 stars. - place settings weren't set when we arrived. We had to ask for silver after our salad had already arrived. Our waiter seemed to be in a hurry through everything including pouring our wine which we had been pacing out for the last two hours. 

Food was 2 stars.  - it was good. We had the biancoverde and the wise guy. We did the wise guy with no olives and added sausage. The food came out really fast but wasn't really out of the oven hot. Was just kind of warm. Now I'm not a local so I'm not sure what the choices are like in the area but I wasn't blown away. It was good. I just wanted more. 

Ambience was 3 - small place with a bar. You can see them prepping the pizzas and putting it in the oven.

I wanted more from something rated so highly.

***Spiandini appetizer is literally to die for!***
I was in Phoenix for business last week and this was on our list of must-haves. Being a resident of Chicago, home of the deep-dish pizza and raised in northeastern NJ, home of the thin crust, I've been spoiled. I also spent 10 days in Italy and ate pizza just about every single day in search for the ""best"" in the various cities. Pizza is my favorite food hands-down. 

Five of us went - waited, and waited, and waited and planned out our strategy - we would all order one of their specialty pizzas. We rotated so we could all try a slice. The only one we didn't get was the marinara one. Slice after slice - despite its appearance - was literally better than the next. I was so pleased with them all and so stuffed at the end. I recommend going with a group so you can savor all the specialities - and I really wouldn't detract too much from how they make it. Some of the topping combinations sounded a bit strange - but trust me - they know what they're doing at Pizzeria Bianco. 

We also got some appetizers which were amazing too. Service was topnotch, wine list was great, wait was long, but you need to prepare\/plan for that like we did. If you have a party of six or more call way in advance for a reservation...at least 4 weeks.

I got the Rosa with salami added, sis got the classic margharita, and brother in law got the wiseguy (the one that I thought sounded the best). All of them were awesome, though I really liked the Rosa. It had the most amazing combination of rich and hearty tastes and you could tell, in all three, the ingredients were fresh and high quality. 

Verdict? Best pizza EVER? 
Well...i'm admittedly biased and probably  predisposed to what i grew up with, but you could certainly do a lot worse. However, without a doubt, Pizzeria Bianco does earn 
the title for Best Pizza in Phoenix.",2,1,0

Being a self proclaimed, well traveled, foodie on the fly, I can honestly say that the valley of the sun has some pretty amazing pizza this side of Italy. Pizzeria Bianco does not disappoint. My last visit, however, it disappointed on just about every level, minus taste. Although, I will caveat with my foodie tongue and say that it's not ever been my favorite pizza in town, no matter what the 'pro's' like Food & Wine may say. I say that Pomo wins that award, hands down. On a Friday night, my hubs and I decided to have an impromptu date night and head to one of our favorite hang outs: Heritage Square. We expected to wait, but we love the Bianco Bar next door. Now, Pizzeria Bianco has always been a little on the 'snooty' side with this, 'we will let you know if you are in OUR bar next door', turning the nose up at Rose and Crown across the ten paces way.. and that is okay. It's left unsaid. You will get it if you visit here. Again, not a worry, because the staff at the bar attached\/not attached to the pizzeria has friendly staff who let you sample and TAKE your time whilst waiting for the pizzeria to open up. We got into Pizzeria Bianco and like most nights we are both home in PHX and on a date night, we like to take our time, sip a wine and talk to each other. Immediately we have the PB waitress speaking to us and asking us if we knew what we wanted. I had not even looked at my menu and I told her so. Literally we had been seated for about 3 minutes. She is there again within 4 or 5 and I went with the chianti. She asked if we knew what we wanted for food. Nope. We didn't. My husband headed to the loo and she approached the table while he was in there asking me yet again about the food order. The theme felt very rushy to both of us. I now gave her a look because I was getting irritated. Again. Date night. Quaint, cute Pizzeria Bianco, wine, candles and I don't want you rushing me! SO STOP. Finally we ordered our apps of the Spiedini, (prosciutto wrapped around warm fontina).. It was not as good as I remembered it from before, but it could have been that I was so irritated with this waitress clearly attempting to churn us out of a nice evening to accompany more people that I could not get past it. On to the pizza. The Sonny Boy does not disappoint. The crust is great with an artisanal premium texture and taste. We added the wood roasted mushrooms for added flavor. We ignored this waitress coming over and over again and enjoyed our pizza. Let's face it, we are the customers, pure and simple. Paying. Customers. I would loved to have had another chianti here because I do love the ambience and the candle light of Pizzeria Bianco, the open brick oven and the pizza and bread smells of it all baking. That said, we finished our dinner and took our night elsewhere with no plans of coming back for pizza anytime soon. Accolades or what not, I personally did not ever think this was the best pizza in the valley, but I did have a fondness and love for the place itself. I've now been lost on the service factor.

And of course I thought, this cannot be true. Because it's not in New York. Call it prejudice, and you'd probably be right, but New Yorkers are incapable of believing ANYTHING in New York is not the best of whatever it is. Pizza especially! Well, Pizzeria Bianco lives up to its reputation. I went twice while visiting Phoenix recently (second time was quite a long, New York-style wait) and had everything on the menu. Holy shit. Amazing. Many people I went with also thought ""best pizza I've ever had."" One old curmudgeonly guy wasn't impressed, but he's that old guy that's not impressed by anything, so forget him for now. I liked it. Especially the white pies! Which NEVER happens because I usually think FUCK PIZZA WITH NO TOMATO SAUCE. I was WRONG. The Rosa is FUCKING INCREDIBLE. GET IT. And more. And go back.

I'd heard great things about the pizza (which is a favorite of Nancy Silverton's of Pizzeria Mozza) and rather frightening things about the line (five hour wait times, what?) so Matt and I met up with our friend Stef P. at about 10:45 on a Saturday morning. By 11, when the doors opened, we were one of two parties waiting for a table. We saw no line the whole time we were here, so maybe massive wait times are a thing of the past.

The place was very charming, small and cozy, located in some kind of science center park that felt a bit like a college campus. Apple Maps did a shit job getting us to the right building, so we missed the free lot. Be advised that there is one, and that it's much closer than any metered parking. The restaurant felt like a new wave fancy pizzeria, with big ovens and a modern\/rustic decor. Service was good, efficient and friendly.

We drank beer with our lunch (I forget what was on tap, but it was good), and enjoyed the excellent pizza. Stef and I shared the Wiseguy and the Sonny Boy, while Matt had the Margherita. The pizzas were delicious, with flavorful crusts that were beautifully charred with a good amount of both crisp and chew. The toppings were high quality. The Wiseguy was probably my favorite, a white pie loaded with wood-roasted onion, house smoked mozzarella, and fennel sausage. That sausage was so savory, that onion so subtly sweet. The Sonny Boy was also a winner, with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, salami, and olives, meaty and full of flavor. I stole a bit of Matt's Margherita, and it was a top notch version of the classic pie, with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil.

Pizzaria Bianco seemed to be the place with the most buzz; despite my trepidation about the long waits, I was curious as to what all the chatter was about. 

My companion and I rolled in about 7:30 that Saturday night, talked to a friendly hostess, and were told that the wait was 2 1\/2 hours. I'd anticipated this, so we went off to run some errands during the wait. We also killed some time in the ""bar next door."" (One might also call it an ingenious scam, since certainly no one in Bar Bianco was there to drink but to eat Bianco pizza, and with all that room they could expand the establishment or at least serve pizza out on the patios, which they don't appear to do.) Upon seating, about 2 hours into said wait, we ordered a Wise Guy (onion, smoked mozzarella, fennel sausage) and a Biancoverde (mozzarella, Parmesan, ricotta, arugula); the waiter kindly steered us in the direction of putting red sauce on our Wise Guy, so we'd not have two all white pizzas. In the end, we enjoyed it this way, but I'm still curious about the intended flavor of the Wise Guy. The Biancoverde was authentic, rich, and purely delicious. Some might call it too much, too heavy, but it suited my taste that night. And, to agree with some other reviewers, the pizza was mostly crisp, but then soggy toward the center.

I wouldn't call the pizza at Pizzaria Bianco the best in the world, country, or even my personal experience; nor would I call it worth a 2-3 hour wait. But I would call it a worthy meal. The atmosphere is trendy and warm, the staff is attentive, and the prices are perfectly reasonable. Give it a go if you have the time. I recommend attending as an individual or a couple, so you're in faster -- the hostess will offer to bump you up on the list if there's room at the bar.",0,0,0

Before we get there though, flashback to 2008.  One year ago, I heard of this place.  After hearing about the unbelievable wait and unwilling to invest 3+ hours of time regardless of the deliciousness of the pizza, I placed Pizzeria Bianco in a spot in my mind reserved for the unattainable such as owning my own private island or being with Megan Fox.

Then one day, somebody informed me that Bianco accepts reservations for groups of 6+.  Hallelujah!  I immediately made a reservation only to find that the first available was about a month later.  Undeterred, I booked it.

When the day came, I was not disappointed with appearances!  There's something about the decor of both the Pizzeria and the little bar next door that makes it very inviting.  It almost felt like I was showing up at a party that somebody invited me to.

The food itself was good, almost great, but again, with the expectations and the wait, it was difficult to fulfill.  The sampler appetizer platters showcased some wonderful cheeses and olives and cured meats.  The salads were crisp and flavorful.  The pizza itself was a little thin and crispy-crusted for my personal liking, but the ingredients were fresh as can be and delicious.

One thing that I missed was more of an emphasis on tomato-based pizzas, which amongst our group, was the first pizza to be quickly snatched up and eaten.

Overall, a wonderful experience, but I don't know if I'd come back again simply due to the logistical coordination required and the high price blowing my expectations beyond what could be satiated.",1,0,0

The food was fabulous, I was a little disappointed with the service, I would have wished the server to be a little bit more knowledgeable about the menu, and be able to tell us about the pizza (such as if they made their own mozzarella, what type of products we were ordering, if they made their own crust, ect), other than that I would recommend this place to anyone!",3,0,1

I have not been to Pizzeria Bianco since 2012. Since then I have many faux\/real Neapolitan pizzerias. I really wanted to not like pizzeria Bianco due to its popularity BUT they honestly have the best Pizza in all of Phoenix. It would make sense; Pizzaolo Bianco made artisanal pizza popular in PHX.  

I heard that when you visit a pizzeria, the best Pizza to indicate if the joint is worth visiting again or not is the classic margarita pizza. Their Margarita has a light and naturally sweet tomato sauce that elevates your taste buds to the heavens. I think I could eat their pizza with just tomato sauce without any cheese any day of the week.

My new favorite pizza is the Rosa. If you are a fan of Parmesan as well as pistachio, you'll love the intensity of these flavors on a pizza. The crust on this pizza was really something special and differentiates Pizzeria Bianco from the competition. It was crispy on the outside while still chewy on the inside (no oil used) while still full of delectable flavor. 

This place is not just for hype. If you have any appreciation for simple and quality ingredients go to pizzeria Bianco!",2,1,1

Waiting an OBSCENE amount of time for a pizza is a pretty big one. If this pizza was not as good I would be angry I think.

I would tell you about it ( HERE)... 

but you know what its that good. I have had pizza around the world ,its not the best..... but this is pretty close to the best you are going to get in this area code. I would love to say don't believe  ""the hype"" but yo there is a reason you have to wait sometimes as long as 4+ hours for a pizza on a Saturday night.

 Lets really face the reality of that night though. You are gonna want to hang  around at other bars drinking with your friends anyway.Its certainly not going to be a cheaper night of entertainment either.. Armed with that information you know what to expect. While there is another place close by that is just as good but not as central.This is worth it just to know what people are talking about.

This Pizza is wood fired and made with world class ingredients. The thin cust is perfect. 
The service at least for me was rushed and sorta unplesant. We were literally the last people in there by the time they sat us, so I am not sure if that behavior \/ treatment is normal.

We used to eat at his place when he was in a strip mall on Camelback and watched his business ""grow"" to what it is now.   I jokingly say ""grow"" because he probably has less tables now than he did before.  The only difference is that he didnt have a wine bar to send his customers to wait for 2 hours.

If you've been to Biancos then you already know the game but for those who dont, here goes:

1. You won't get in unless you stand outside for about 90 minutes before they open.  (Please)

2. If you get there when they open, you'll be waiting for 2 hours. (Please)

3. To make your 2 hour wait better he has a wine bar, which miraculously accommodates all the people he cant seat, where you will probably spend over $100 in booze as you wait.  Sort of like the beverage equivalent of the slot machines in the Vegas airport.

4. When you jump through all those hurdles, you'll get some awesome food.  You'll also notice that he only has a few tables which is why the wait is so long.  I can appreciate the fact that he wants to maintin the quality of his food, resulting in limited production but is it ""all that""?

Our group of six were well-informed about what to expect were therefore comfortably prepared for an absolutely great experience.  We were told that there would be a two hour wait, so we arrived at Pizzeria Bianco's at 5:00 p.m., put our name down, and happily passed the time away with champagne, great beer, and a nice cheese and salami plate at Bar Bianco's.  It gave us a chance to relax, catch up with one another, and develop a great buzz (and appetite!) before we were seated.  

Sure enough, we were seated on-time and there was great energy in the restaurant.  The decor was quaint, simple and not pretentious.  Despite the huge pizza oven that became an interesting focal point in the restaurant and could be seen from any point in the dining room, it was comfortably cool for its patrons in the Phoenix heat!  The place is a bit small and I wouldn't recommend going with more than 6 people.  For those who complain about this factor, I've learned through my travels that some of the coolest locations in the world like the Devil's Throat which accommodates only one spelunker at a time in its cave passages, or the little booth in the Parisian cafe that accommodates a maximum of four people at a time  - not every place can always accommodate you - sometimes YOU have to accommodate the place and sometimes you have to sacrifice a little for the experience.  (Alrighty, I guess that's enough ranting about the Ugly American from me!).  The place has a casual vibe and there were plenty of patrons in t-shirts and shorts, but I would feel like I were disrespectful of the whole experience if my husband hadn't worn at least a collared shirt with his shorts.  We all had shorts on, but were dressed nicer than if we were just going to the local taco stand.  

We ordered 5 out of the 6 pies on the menu and we also ordered two salads (plenty of food for all of us just as the waiter had advised).  The caprese salad (tomatoes and mozzarella) had some of the tastiest mozzarella I've ever had!  All of the pies were great and I would not be the least bit hesitant to order any of them again, but my personal favorites were the Margherita and the Sonny Boy.  Not surprisingly,  everyone at our table had a different favorite because they were all great.  Overall, not only was the thin crust a perfect combination of chewy and crispy, but it was also tasty - I could eat the crust without any toppings (one prerequisite for me in a great pizza - like fresh home made pasta that doesn't need anything but a little olive oil and sea salt).  Each pie was a work of art - just beautifully rustic and easily identifiable since the toppings were certainly not hiding under a ton of cheese - they were lying on top in all their naked glory.  So people want to know - how does it compare to authentic Italian Pizza or New York Pizza?  I don't know.  It's Pizzeria Bianco's pizza!  

Now the all important final answer everyone wants to know - is Pizzeria Bianco's the best pizza in the world?  I can't say for sure - I haven't been to Italy or a bunch of other places in the world that has pizza, but with impeccably fresh ingredients, undoubtedly good food, a great atmosphere, and courteous service, it is up there with some of the greatest pizza and greatest and most memorable pizza experiences I've ever had.  That's good enough for me to give this place five stars.",6,0,9

Also while the food itself is very well-priced for the quality that you get I think this place makes its real money off it's bar next door where you will most likely wait 2 hours and order some drinks to keep your sanity.  So in other words unless you like waiting in line outside expect to spend some money in the bar while you wait.

The pizza's themselves seem to live up the reputation.  Anything you order will have the kind of chewy but crispy crust you'd expect from a place that claims to be one of the best pizza joints in the US.  The real star of the show  though, is the toppings.  

I was lucky enough to try two pizzas, the Margherita and the Rosa.  The Margherita had the freshest tasting mozzarella and basil on top of a tomato sauce that wasn't overpowering.  I knew I had to order the Rosa just because the toppings looked so odd (Onion, Parmigiano, Rosemary, Pistachios) and I was blown away by how well everything completed each other.  Unlike some pizza joints that just pile on toppings that tend to blend together, all of the toppings on display here were distinct and went together superbly.

I was in Phoenix for 7 days and at at Bianco 2x.  It was so nice and the atmosphere is really easy and fun.  I didn't order the GF pizza this time around but I had the olives, which were killer.  The olives were so good the second time around we ordered 2 plates of them! mm... I also had the salad with the fennel and it was absolutely delicious.  It was dressed perfectly, not too light and not too heavy... the salad was just refreshing.  I couldn't have asked for anything better.  I also had a side of salami and that was also great.  The pieces were cut thinly and I really enjoyed the salami with the olives and even my salad.  Awesome!  My dad had the Sonny Boy pizza but he subbed in sausage. The sausage was delicious... I stole a few pieces off of his pizza.  Bianco is fast, easy, affordable and the obvious, Delicious!  Go there!  If you live in Phoenix, or are visiting!  I highly recommend.

Also, we did not encounter the so called 2-hr wait people in the area talked about.  I guess we got lucky, but were also there during the week days and during work hours.

1. Show up at 3:30 or earlier to get a good place in line. Make sure you bring some friends to enjoy the time together and the great food.

3. Order a few appetizers from the bar; they're light and fresh and yummy.
4. When you finally get seated for dinner, don't hold back. Order salads, share different pizzas, and have a coffee after.

Brevity is also a wonderful thing when it comes to the waiting time for your dinner of Italian peasant food...pizza:)

Brevity is not Pizzeria Bianco's strong suit...(nor mine, in writing reviews, but we're not talking about me:)

After my second visit in 4 years (and 4th visit overall), I'm trying to figure out what PB's strong suit is:(...public relations and marketing, perhaps?

Creating the ""Pizza Placebo Effect""?

I generally try not to knowingly go anyplace that aggravates me, whether it's for dining, for drinking, for entertainment, for using the restroom...really for pretty much anything:)

So why were we back at PB after a good solid 4 year run of avoiding this particular aggravation?   

Other people, that's why:)

Other people wanted to go to PB...other people wanted to try the Wiseguy and the Marghareta and see Chris's oven and have mozzarella cheese and what not... and so the Beautiful Carin (who has the patience of a saint) and I took them out to PB the other evening...well, it was evening when  we started:(

We went...we waited...we had some pizza...and it was pretty average artisan pizza...

Was it the worst pizza I've ever eaten?...oh no...'sup, Totino's?

Was it the best pizza that I can remember eating?...oh no...How you doin' Flying Pie in Portland and Di Fara in Brooklyn?

Is PB worth the aggravation?...Sadly, not for me:(

For me, it's hard to overlook the attitude at the door, and the ""you're barely worthy of eating here"" attitudes of the servers (both in Bar Bianco and Pizzeria Bianco), as I try to enjoy my evening.

I understand that all the kids ""assisting Chris"" at PB think they're pretty special to be working at PB and all...but...it's a pizza joint...would it hurt them to at least try to be personable and pleasant?

It's also hard for me to overlook the multi-hour wait to dine at PB (and, truth be told, we've been here before...we did come expecting a wait...we were prepared to have wine and relax...I even had my flask, so I had a scotch and tried to relax)...still 3  1\/2 hours...for pizza?

I can fly  1\/2 way to NYC in the time it takes to get a table (and the flight attendants on Continental are sweet and pleasant to me...feed me drinks in 1st class...you know...they make me feel appreciated:)

And speaking of ""appreciated""...it's hard for me to overlook the lack of appreciation we've encountered at PB:(

The few times we've been to PB, the staff hasn't seemed to be in a pleasant mood...very quick to tell us ""the rules of PB"" and eager to let us know that if we weren't good little customers, there were 50 more people in line that would happy to take our places:(

You know what... they are right...there were 50 more people that would have loved to see us leave and they would have moved up in the queue.

But it's obnoxious of the folks at PB to make that the overriding theme of the evening and it belies any pretense that they might try to concoct about ""customer service"" and being the ""the best possible pizza experience for each customer""...the attitude of ""we're PB and you're not"" is pervasive and unpleasant:(

And frankly, when I spend well over $200 for pizza, wine and cheese for 4 in the course of a 3+hour wait, get a rush job on the very late dinner and a lamentable lack of service from the waiter (who's busy chatting with friends or ""regulars"" at the counter)...well, it causes me aggravation.

But the good news is that I won't be back for another 4 years...less aggravation for me and more spaces in the line at the door:)",31,26,22

There's nothing much I can say that haven't been said before, but I'll say it again anyway.  I loved this place, the decor was fake italian, perfect for a pizza place.  Kitchen is nice and visible, food is simple and non pretentious.  Waiters are very helpful but the hostesses are bitchy, just like NY!!!  I must confess though that I didn't have to wait more than 15 mins for a table, because I'm cool like that ;) I wish, but in reality I had reservations, and it comes free with searing looks from the rest of the folks thats been waiting in line for 3-5 hours.

I really didn't bother with the menu we just asked our water to bring us his favorite combination of 8 pizzas and then enjoyed couple of bottles of wine and some antipasto (the roasted vegetable platter), which was sooooo good.  Pizza was amazing, and didn't disappoint one bit.  Ingredients were fresh, honest, and each component held it's own.  the crust was crispy and delicious, sauce was simple and non-overpowering, and the cheese was minimal, just like any good pizza joint should be.  

for a place this exclusive, the price was pretty down to earth, there wasn't an item on the menu more than 17$, can't beat that.  I can see why people would give this place 1 star, because it's a pain in the ass to wait so long for just pizza, and I could see people giving it 3-4 stars just because the experience as a whole, was disappointing.  In reality this is a 5 star pizza place, with 4 star service, and 1 star for the wait, but you should at least try it out once.",2,1,0

In my multiple experiences of visiting this location and the second one near the Biltmore, I have no reason to doubt it. For my money, it's certainly the best pizza I've had. 

A quick note on the restaurant itself, it's pretty small inside. I would guess it could hold, at most, around 50 people. There are usually always waits but in my experience, the lunch hour is the best time to visit the original location. If you do decide to brave the wait for dinner, there is a bar that they run next door that serves alcohol and some small plates to ease the wait.

Now, onto the pizza. I've tried all the pizzas on the menu and the two that I recommend most are the Margarita and Wiseguy. Both having different appeal, the Margarita is superb. The tomato sauce is fresh, juicy, and not too sweet. The mozzarella cheese is easily the best I've ever had on a pizza - smooth, firm, and properly salted, it is a wonder on its own merit. Finally, there's the crust, crisp and bubbled on the outside and soft and airy on the inside. Combine the three elements together with fresh basil leaves on top and for me, it's the best pizza there is.

As for the Wiseguy, any meat lovers will adore this masterpiece. A white pizza, this one features fennel sausage and roasted onions along with the aforementioned mozzarella. Both the sausage and onion carry a smoky flavor that is enhanced by the smooth creaminess of the mozzarella. This applies to both pizzas but I highly recommend adding garlic to the pizza for an added flavor dimension. 

Overall, this is easily the best pizza in Arizona, with apologies to Pomo, Cibo, and Federal. As for the best in the country, perhaps that's a better question for someone with extensive experience. For me though, I see no reason to doubt the claim.",3,0,0

However, we happened to pass by this time on a Saturday at 4 PM and walked right into the last table. 

The service here is simple and fast. There is really only one server, host, chef, and busser working the entire place. Although it is small, I am still impressed at how they coordinate and work together to serve everyone. Right when you need them, they are there and when you don't, they're gone. Why do other places have such trouble figuring this balance out? Clearly, the employees at Pizzeria Bianco are sharp, skilled, and care about meeting customers' needs. Our pizza arrived literally three minutes after we ordered.

The pizza is cooked in a brick oven, which leaves the crust nice and crispy, the cheese gooey, and the toppings juicy. We tried the Sonny Boy, which comes with tomato sauce, mozzarella, olives, and salami. Everything was cooked perfectly and the thin crust is much appreciated. The olives are quite powerful, so be careful if you aren't a fan of those. The salami topping was crispy and flavorful. The pizza came with a ton of toppings that covered the whole thing. The sweet organic iced tea was refreshing to drink.

The pizza had six large, thin slices and was perfect as a light meal for two. Heavy eaters and larger parties will probably need to order a few pizzas. We came just before the dinner rush and got in without trouble.

I recommend Pizzeria Bianco for a light and tasty brick oven pizza in a local, friendly atmosphere. Visit during off-peak hours to avoid long wait times.",3,0,1

We didn't have too large of an appetite so we decided to share the Wiseguy pizza. The Wiseguy consists of roasted onions, smoked mozzarella and fennel sausage. The crust is flakey, crisp and the pizza thin. This pizza definitely showcases simple but flavorful ingredients without overwhelming you with tons of sauce and cheese, in fact it's on the dry side. It's more gourmet tasting, if you want to put it that way. If you're looking for gooey cheese, marinara sauce and pizza topped with tons of meat toppings this is NOT the place.

That's a heady claim. 

Being from Albany NY, with it's proximity to the pizza capital of the world, NY City, we have some very good pizza places. But nothing that comes close to the notoriety of Pizzeria Bianco.

Having read through some yelp reviews bemoaning the long waits, and with my wife tagging along, sitting 2-3 hours in the 100 degree heat was not an option. My plan was to go 1\/2 hour before opening. Thus, I was sure to be in the first or second seating, and the wait would be tolerable (I hoped).

We headed over on a Saturday morning and arrived a little late. They open at 11, and we arrived 10:45, due to lack of parking and unfamiliarity with the area. To my surprise there was only two other brave souls waiting outside the restaurant wilting in the heat. YES!

My guess is the long waits are for dinner. So if you must have a Pizzeria Bianco pizza, (and if you love pizza you must), I'm willing to bet you'll have a short wait if you come at lunchtime, at least on the weekends.

We ordered two pizzas and wow were they good. It's without a doubt some of the best pizza I've ever had. The crust is light, oh so light, but still chewy and crunchy, (that's awesome, because you can eat a lot of slices without feeling bloated and full). Big bubbles adorn the end crust, and those burnt bubbles have a very subtle smokiness to them from the wood fire. The toppings all were of high quality too. The sauce tastes of fresh tomatoes, and it's *just* sweet enough.

Pizzeria Bianco lives up to the hype as one of the best pizzas in America. If I'm ever in Phoenix again, it will be the first stop I make.",4,0,5

I was recently in Phoenix attending a wedding and this was my number one spot to check out. I was expecting at least an hour wait for such a prestigious spot on a Friday night, but the wait was shorter than expected (about 30 minutes). A bar is right next door with outdoor seating, so the wait isn't bad.

The service inside is outstanding. We were given constant attention (without being overbearing). I recommend getting the half and half, which you can do with any of the pizzas. My girlfriend and I were able to try four different pizzas (margherita, wise guy, rosa, biancoverde). The rosa is the possibly the best pizza I've ever had (...and I'm from Chicago).

Not only was it amazing, it was ready five minutes(!) after we ordered!

Regardless, I thought it was a bold statement. I mean, who could possibly say that about pizza? Pizza is so subjective (i.e. deep dish, thin crust, grilled, electric oven, brick oven, etc.), and you can't possibly satisfy everyone with one type of pizza.

Well, curiosity still managed to get the best of me, so I convinced two of my friends to drive 5 1\/2 hours with me to Phoenix to find out for myself. (As an FYI, we did go to a few other restaurants on that day-long trip. Just wanted to make that clear so you don't think I was entirely crazy for driving that far to check out just one joint.)

We got to PB around 6pm and I gave the hostess my name.  

""It'll be a 3 1\/2 hour wait,"" she casually informed me.  

She smiled, but she didn't blink. She didn't give off even the slightest impression that she felt bad that we'd have to wait so long for pizza (in 110+ degree Arizona heat, mind you). It's nothing short of crazy that we are living in an era where pizza-in-under-thirty-minutes has been replaced by pizza-in-three-hours. I guess if I had to think of anything positive about waiting that long is that you can go next door to their bar, go across the way to The Rose and Crown and shoot pool or just befriend others who are just as crazy as you are for waiting that long for pizza.

Having said all that, here is my review:

The ambience is nice. It's dimly-lit to create a romantic environment for couples, or just a peaceful dining experience if you're with friends.

The country bread, as simple as it looks, is really good, especially when you dip it in the olive oil (add salt and pepper).

Finally, the pizzas were... AMAZING. We had built up our expectations so much that by the time we got the order, we were positive we would be disappointed. But with the first bite, we knew our trip was not made in vain. It was completely worth it. And that's saying a lot since I'm a die-hard deep dish guy. To say these were thin would be an understatement; sometimes you could see through the pizza because it was so thin.
  
Sonny Boy - The amount of tomato sauce and the fresh ingredients went perfectly together. Though I'm not a fan of salami, the pieces on this pizza created a party in my mouth. So rich. So good.

Wise Guy - No tomato sauce on this (note that half of the pizzas on the menu do not have tomato sauce), but the onions, mozzarella, and sausage were amazing as well, just bursting with flavor. Yes, bursting.  
 
So... was it worth the drive? To be honest, I think even if it didn't meet the hype, the experience would have been worthwhile. I mean, come on, you only live once. Why not do a few out-of-the-ordinary things occasionally? Fortunately for us, Bianco's was outstanding and definitely worth driving out for.  

Mr. Bianco, you get 5 stars from me because your pizzas are my favorite in the country.",3,1,2

In other words, the waiter told us we had been there long enough and it was time to leave even though we were continually ordering food and wine.

We arrived before 3:00 and were the third group in line.  I suppose it is rather ridiculous to line up that early when it doesn't open until 5:00, but such is life.  Bianco regulars that showed up later seemed to be used to it.  There are seats and benches outside under the shade where you can bade your time, or you can wander around the (somewhat limited) area.

While there are many terrific pizza places, what made Pizzeria Bianco a defining pizza experience for me was the balance.  There are lots of places with good dough, good sauce, good cheese, and good toppings, but a true standout pizzeria will make all the individual ingredients work together to make something truly delicious that haunts your taste buds for more, even weeks later.

The Biancoverde was the clear winner.  Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, ricotta, and arugula.  Sounds pretty simple, but it was combined to make something magical.  Crispy and smokey from the wood fire oven, sharp salty savoriness from the Parmigiano Reggiano, creamy from the ricotta and mozzarella, cut by a slight bitterness from the arugula.

The smokiness of the smoked mozzarella played well off of the sweet caramelized onions and fennel sausage in the Wiseguy.  I thought the Margherita would be the somewhat boring pie, but it went over just as well as the other pies.

The antipasto plate was also quite amazing.  The pairings of roasted vegetables, sopressata, and cheese worked in delicious harmony.

Definitely do your homework prior to coming if you want a good experience.  Slice has an excellent primer to get you ready.

We started with sharing the market salad it was perfectly dressed and came with the freshest greens , goat cheese and strawberries that were special ,meaning not the supermarket Frankenstein berries but REAL farmers market type and you really can taste the difference .

As far as I know the only thing you can't order at lunch time is the great Antipasto and also the Bar Bianco opens near dinner time .

We ordered two pizzas the Rosa and the Wise Guy .

We both agree the Rosa was the most interesting pizza but at the time I thought the rosemary was missing and the strongest taste was the Parmigiano Regiano . The crust had a small amount of raw flour and black burnt air pops . Still I thought this was a good pizza and took most of it home and also ordered a Biancoverde to take home and have for dinner latter .

We make some discoveries in the reheating process .

One I wasn't thinking and the Biancoverde doesn't reheat well and that is my fault I should have known but I wanted to try it since I never had that one before and it sounded too heavy for lunch time but it really wouldn't have been because it is  VERY lightly topped with Mozzarella , Parmigiano Reggiano , Ricotta and Arugula . In the reheating process this became very oily and sort of partially fell apart and the arugula fried itself to a crisp .
The other discovery was the reheating process improved the Rosa pizza making the pistachios come to life and making the pizza taste wonderful I did notice rosemary was used but not every slice had a leaf .
This has been our third or fourth time dining here but our first time with out all the waiting and chatting with strangers and drinking a few bottles of wine and also the first time not enjoying the Fabulous Antipasto . What I am trying to say is dining here during the day loses the MYSTIQUE , the ALLURE and the Romanticism that is associated with Pizzaria Bianco and sort of seems like you are getting your Birthday Present handed to you unwrapped .

If you asked me until just before my last visit I would have rated this 4-5 stars but now it really seems more 3-4ish and I also forgot to add the only iced tea is a bottled sweetened iced tea and they also offer house bottled water or Mexican Bottled Coke .

I thought I remembered the pizza much better? or maybe it was the wine and all the anticipation? or maybe it was different? don't KNOW?

Maybe it is the Best Pizza...I don't know but I think your first try should be at dinner time .",6,1,2

Doors opened right at 11a and we were seated right away. Litle rushed to order but if you are here you should already know what you want because you have researched it over and over dreaming of the day you go.
  I'm going 4 stars not because of the pizza(3stars) but because i was transported back in time to when i was 10 growing up in(movie Sideways was filmed here)  Santa Ynez, Ca. When I was a kid, an older couple moved to the Valley from Rome and opened up a small pizzeria called The Roman Kitchen. The smell of Bianco reminded me of the old wood\/brick oven they would fire everything in. To this day by far the best pizza I've ever had R.I.P. Roman Kitchen.  Overall the pizza was good pushing towards great. But not worth a hour wait. Then again I do not feel any food is worth that wait. Will I be back? Yes, only for lunch, for I do not care to stand around for hours for some pizza.

Let's be honest, back in the day there was a 3 hour waiting line. I only would wait for 3 hours in the ER if I'm bleeding more than half gallon per hour, but never for food and furthermore never for pizza.

So now that things have settled a little bit, it was my time to visit the place. In my crew there were 4 kids although the place is far from kid friendly, and so is the service. Anyhow, let's cut to the chase.

The menu, although small, has a good selection. The antipasto was good with one meat, one cheese, some cauliflower, red pepper, olives and a couple of other things. It was good and a nice portion.

I also had the caprese salad but I really missed some balsamic vinegar. The EVOO was tasteful but some balsamic is a must (in my opinion).

I also had the rosa pizza. The parmesano raggiano flavor dominates in a super pleasent way. I would recommend people to share because the whole thing (with the same flavor) is a little too much. Don't take me wrong, I loved this pizza but maybe would like to taste something else as well.

They don't have deserts besides a biscotte that was good and I had a double capuccino  that was good as well.

One thing I didn't like is that they don't have lemonade. WTH? I was craving an Arnold Palmer to fight the heat back but had to settle with an ice tea.

Anyways, great food, the place worth it if you don't have to wait, nice ambiance and the neighborhood is nice for a walk after the feast.

I have sampled pizza from around the world and who would of thought that such perfection could come out of PHX!!! I am sorry I think some of you guys are griping just to gripe about this place.  So you have to wait and yes it can be multiple hours , but when that first bite of your perfectly crafted pizza hits your taste buds BAM!  I get taken away on a magical journey full of artisan mozzarella, Italian cheeses, house made sausage, perfect sauce,  all served on the perfect vessel made to carry all these ingredients to the top of Mt. Olympus where the gods consume such pizza goodness!  
I feel like everyone has a story about how they got to PB and here is mine:
I recently worked in England at one of the best restaurants in the world.  The chef has a book series called ""The Search For Perfection"".  One of the recipes from the book was the perfect pizza.  After this book was published (around 2 years ago) there was a constant discussion at work who served the best pizza in the world. Of course all the Europeans would say Italy, but there was always one or two chefs that would speak of the holy grail of pizza found in PHX. This is where I first heard of Pizzeria Bianco's magic.  I felt a little confused at first.  I always thought the best pizza in the country at least was found in NYC, but to hear that such a place existed in PHX that not only was best in country , but best in world I had to find a way to get there.  Finally the day came!  I was in town for a convention, but all I could think about was this pizza and I had not even had one yet.  

It was a Thursday night and I told all my coworkers we are going here.  I get them together around 430 and get over there at 5 and I already see the place is packed!  I am a little worried on how long the wait was going to be , but I was prepared to wait as long as possible.  I was there after all to eat pizza and nothing else.  The beautiful hostess approached me and told me that the wait would be 4 hours!  I was totally prepared but my co workers were not.  They decided no food is worth waiting that long for, but of course they were wrong.  I did not know what to do and proceeded to freak out a little.  Thinking I wouldn't get to try a piece of this ambrosial pizza.  It turns out during this time we were trying to figure out what to do another company had offered to take us out to dinner.  Now dinner had become business and I had to go.  This was around 630.  

They had reservations at this sushi place.  We sat down at seven and I begin to get more and more depressed that I might miss this pizza because this is our last night in town.  I snuck to the bathroom to call a friend so they can tell me what time PB stops serving.  I found out the last call is 10 and if you make by 10 you will be served.  Things are looking up!  I sort of rush us through a big sushi dinner.  In the back of my mind I didn't think I was going to make it because of the consumption of sushi, but I knew in my heart of hearts that I would make it.  As soon I get back to the hotel , around 845, I call a taxi and snuck away to the mecca of pizza AGAIN!  I get there around 920 and I get a sense of relief as soon as I smell the wood fired oven once again.  This hostess was pleased to see me again and told me I had about an hour to wait.  I was all by myself, full off sushi, and I couldn't even sit because I was so excited for what lies a head.   I pace impatiently outside and scowl at all the patrons in the restaurant hoping that it might hasten their meals.  

Finally,  its my turn!  I get seated at the bar.  I immediately know what I want.  I could not make up my mind, so I just decide to order two pizzas!  I am a gourmand.  I order the Margarita because that is a true test of what a pizza maker is made out of and the Bianco verde.  The waiter even commented how he liked my style.  I told him I was doing important research and he understood.  I nearly cried when the first pizza came out.  The artisan look and smell was unbelievable.  The taste!!!  oh my god the taste!!!!  I am salivating now just writing about the smokey unadulterated perfection only created by such ovens and hands of a master.  I could not complete both of the pies and figured I would later and took them home.  Still at home hours later the pizza carried the magic of the restaurant with it.  I am truly humbled by my experience at Pizzeria Bianco.  I had the chance to talk to Chris Bianco , who is there every night making your pizza , I told him of my adventure getting to his place and he was very grateful.

This was def a highlight of my gastronomic experiences and would recommend this to anybody to do at least once before you died.  And all you haters need to look past the wait and the scene and just look at the pizza.",8,3,10

This restaurant is amazing. Our wait was a little under three hours long on a Thursday evening. We arrived at six, and received our first pizzas just after nine. Three of us ordered six pizzas and finished five. 
You will not see any crusts piling up on the tables, because they are a perfectly charred, yet chewy, and good enough to be on the menus by themselves. Even licking my fork was more satisfying than some other restaurant meals I've had. My napkin appeared unused because I would rather have licked my own face than lose some of that deliciousness to a wipe. 
My first pizza was, of course, the Margherita, and the second was the Biancoverde, with ricotta and arugala, and was quite rich. 
All in all, this is definitely in the top two pizza places I've ever been to, with Apizza Scholls taking points as my amazing local joint in Portland.  If you want to feed a bunch of kids some pizza after a little league game, this is not the place for you.

My thoughts? Skip the Rosa. The parmigiano is way too overwhelming (unless you're into that...then by all means). The Wise Guy is alright but a little too greasy for my tastes. The margherita is solid and my friends rave about the sonny boy (I don't like olives).  But my goodness that biancoverde. That's the one I think about when someone mentions Bianco and the one I go back for every time. The fresh arugula pairs so well with the cheeses and it's so well balanced. You can tell the ingredients are top notch and the crust is just icing on the cake. It is simply incredible.

On the flip side, I would avoid coming here around noon and dinner time since the wait times are outrageous around then. Personally I don't think it's worth waiting over an hour for.

We ordered the house special salad, which was tangerines and citrus dressing, and the caprese salad. Hubby wrinkled his nose up at the tangerine salad, so I took it and gave him the caprese, which I wasn't enjoying because the tomatoes were not ripe at all, they were hard and flavorless. We got one pizza to share, half Sonny Boy and half Wise Guy. It was okay, but nothing special. On a positive note, the olive oil served with the bread is awesome, and the guy behind the bar, David, couldn't have been nicer or given better service.

I visited on a Tuesday at around 11:45 with 1 other friend and the place was almost full.  We started off with the the Spiedini which is a fontina wrapped in proscuitto on a skewer.  It had the right amount of bite to it.  They also brought out some house bread with some olive oil.  We definitely cranked out some pepper on top of it and we couldn't stop eating that.

The salami sandwich was a big portion, glad we ordered this as well.  With the sandwich being cut in half you can see all the different components that came together.

Since we couldn't decide on a pizza we were told the Margherita, Sonny Boy, and Wiseguy were the popular choices.  And any of the other options without protein on it could always be added on with an extra cost.  We stuck with the margherita and it was great.

I guess that is what happens when a place is over hyped, they just don't measure up when you finally get to the experience...

First off Id like to mention my experience was not off to a good start. The hostess was on her phone chatting about what to do that evening and saw I was walking up to her. But she waited Til the very last second of me approaching her to get off her phone to greet me. And I mean I could have put my arms on top of the podium last second to greet me! And I'd like to think it was the restaurant orders and not her bad judgement, in which case the restaurant should take note of it! But she told me to walk in and take any table id like because it was slow. I would like a courtesy walk to my table by a hostess if I were in a decent restaurant. It's just the nice thing to do. Take note of that pizza Bianco. It wasn't like the place was so crowded she couldn't rush back to greet the next guests. She obviously was under worked and probably over paid.

Onto the restaurant. I loved how the pizza making station was out on the floor. Ambiance was nice, servers were quick and friendly and greeted me, unlike the hostess.

And the food... I ordered half fennel and half salami. For me, a good crust makes the pizza for me. And here, it just failed to impress. My crust though textured nice and chewy how I like it was nothing more than that. The outer crust was burnt and tasted like cigarette ash because it was that burnt! And the middle was so soggy that water ran down the tip when I picked it up. I had to practically slide the slice off the plate and into my mouth to eat it and then liquid dropped off onto the plate! That first bite just set the unimpressionable taste for the rest of the pizza. The least they could have done for a $18 pizza was add a little more dough in the middle. That's the cheapest part of making a pizza. I'm not asking for more meats or mozzarella. Just a little tiny bit thicker dough so the middle isn't a soup party. How do people like that shit?! 

On the positive side tho, besides their terrible crust, I did like the fine quality ingredients they did include on the pizza. The smoked mozzarella tasted great and the fennel and salami was tasty as well. Tho the salami was on the saltier side and I think they could have added more mozzarella tho because I had many red spots on my pizza which was not appetizing... And also I liked that as I left the restaurant, everyone working there said good bye and thank you for dining with them. That was nice.

I am shocked to hear that so many national reviews stated this as the nations best pizza place! I think the people who enjoy this place must enjoy cigarettes and don't mind the taste of a burnt soggy pizza in their mouth. But I for one have enjoyed better fire pit pizzas with similar crusts made by pizza shops who understand my dislike for a soggy centered pizza. I'm glad I tried this place and could eat here again if someone took me here but I personally would not choose or ask to eat here again. I've had better pizzas.

I've tried many pizza places in my life, in every town I have visited. Pizza is my absolute favorite food in the world and I can appreciate Chicago style, New York style, I don't discriminate. But what I do not like is soggy burnt pizza, and this place is just that. No thanks. If you enjoy this type of pizza minus the burnt and soggy crust (though made with a similar dough), you must try gjelina in Los Angeles. They make their pizzas right. Not so burnt where you must pick black bubbles off the pizza, but also middle is thick enough to support their many ingredients but still very thin. They also have a variety of ingredients, more so than this place.",6,0,2

Pizzeria bianco has thin crust pizza prepared in an old school brick oven. The waitstaff is friendly and you can tell that this place is definitely popular among the locals given that it was busy even at 2pm on a wednesday afternoon. The menu isn't extremely large, but it's the quality of the ingredients that count in this case.

Tried out the ""Sonny Boy"" and the ""Wise Guy"" pizzas and both tasted pretty good while coming straight out from the oven. This is NOT your typical pizza spot with supreme pizzas, but a place you go to enjoy the creativity and the craftmanship of someone's idea!

Okay, so I lied.  I flew in purposely a bit early, so I could have a friend pick me up and grab lunch with me here.  (To be fair some of my other coworkers were on the plane with me, so it was probably a good call).

So we stuffed ourselves on three pizzas:

Sonny Boy - Enjoyable pizza, and I kept thinking that my wife would've loved thsi since they used olives.  But for those that aren't olive fans, fear not, the flavor of the olives is somewhat muted likely thanks to the heat of the oven and combines well with the saltiness of the salami.  Tasty combination, but not a clear winner...

Rosa - Chris Bianco's personal creation and contribution to the world of pizza, the pistachio, red onion, rosemary, parmesan pizza is quite simply... spectacular.  While it sounds odd, the way the pistachios roast with the oil on the pizza, combined with a slight bight of the red onion and a rosemary\/parmesan flavor to smooth things out.  This really is a spectacular pizza, and our favorite of the three.  For those that like your crust a bit stiff, this is pretty ideal as well, as you don't have the fresh mozz and sauce pushing on the thin crust to make it soggy.  Seriously, get this pizza...

Margherita - We ended on a margherita, and as many margheriitas, it's phenomenal for the first few minutes straight out of the oven.  The primary issue with Neapolitan style pizza is that it's crisp\/firm right upon exit, and within 4 minutes or so, the middle will soak the sauce\/moisture from the pizza, and become soggy surely but steadily... all the while, the flavors of the basil\/mozz begin to meld better with the sauce.  That being said, this was still a great pizza, and being able to taste the difference from the first slice to the last slice is eye opening in terms of understanding how the ingredients play together over time.  A classic that worth getting.

Verdict:  Bianco lives up to my years of waiting.  Is it the best pizza in the US?  I don't know if it deserves that designation necessarily... is it one of the best pizzas I've had in the states so far?  Absolutely.  My only regret is not having enough stomach to try one of every pizza on the menu... Will be back whenever I can make it!",1,0,0

It's been nearly two years since I have been to PB, but I'm glad that nothing's changed. The service is incredibly attentive, the atmosphere is rustic\/casual-chic, and the food is both delicious and reasonably priced. Bianco has high standards for quality and so every aspect of our lunch was flawless. From the table bread which was soft on the inside but with a good crust on the outside, the high-quality olive oil that came with it, and the locally sourced produce they use, an experience at Pizzeria Bianco is unsurpassed. 

We started off with one of my most favorite things: the Spiedini appetizer. Traditionally, spiedini are the Italian equivalent of kebabs or yakitori; skewered meats grilled or baked in open fire. Bianco's version is sinful-prosciutto wrapped fontina cheese on a wooden stick, grilled in the oven. Lusciously gooey cheese encapsulated in salty, fatty pork and served on a bed of peppery local arugula.

Since we were having lunch so late and we had big dinner plans, we decided to split one pizza (which was more than enough). We went with the Wiseguy which featured wood-roasted onions (sweet and tender), house-smoked mozzarella, and fennel sausage. The smoke on the mozzarella was perfect; not too overwhelming, but very distinct, and the sausage was dense and locally made by Schreiner's Phoenix. Although the toppings on this pizza were delicious, the highlight was really in the dough. I've always thought that what really sets Bianco's pizzas apart from everyone else was the quality and texture of the crust. Crisp, yet delicate; soft enough but with a slight chew. Pizzeria Bianco has mastered pizza dough.

LOVE.

TIPS: Try and make reservations for groups of 6 or more or try to make it for lunch. If coming for dinner, come prepared for a bit of a wait. Bar Bianco next door is a great way to kill some time.",5,1,3

I finally got the opportunity to go to night!  Fellow Yelper from Houston, Ryan, was in town for work again and invited me out.  We met up at the wine bar next door and got a cheese plate.  Three different kinds of cheese, all really good and tangy!  The thin bread the came with was a bit too crunchy to eat with cheese on it, but tasty nonetheless.  Finally, after a two hour wait, we were called!
We're in!  I'm going to Pizzeria Bianco!!!!
We had a really nice waiter.  He was there when we needed, didn't hover at all.  We started with a couple appetizers.  I had a prosciutto-wrapped melted cheese on a skewer.  There is nothing better in this world than melted cheese!  The skewers were served on a bed of ""micro-arugula"" and drizzled with olive oil.  Soooooooooooooo yummy!  
We ordered two pizzas to share: The Wiseguy and the Biancoverde.  The Wiseguy had sausage and caramelized onions on it.  Really good!  The Biancoverde, though, was even better.  Three different cheese and again, the micro-arugula.  I'm not a crust person.  I ate the parts with the toppings, but not the edged.  I never do.  The crust was thin and had soaked up some of the natural grease that comes with melted cheese.  Definitely got a wet spot from it!  
I'm full.  I'm exhausted.  I had had a strange and mildly crappy day, and this made it worthwhile.
I'll be back.  To me, definitely worth the wait!  I only wish my Buffalo sister, Jennifer, could have had such a good experience before leaving the Valley.",23,20,23

Like Aaron's review states, there is no place like Antica Pizzeria Da Michele in Naples and once you've had it, you become compelled to find a place stateside that is as good (or even close?).  So when I saw that Bianco was rated #1 in America I knew it would only be a matter of time before I booked a ticket to Phoenix....

I expected to wait in line and, despite the 90+ degree weather, resolved to enjoy it as part of the process.  Once our names were on the list, we scored a seat in the wine bar next door (brilliant set-up when you have a captive audience) and enjoyed a couple of glasses of chianti while we waited.   

It wasn't long before our names came up and we were in.  More wine was ordered and we started with appetizers of spiadini (grilled, prosciutto-wrapped slices of fontina on rosemary skewers).  Killer.

We tried three of the pizzas-  and they were all excellent.  Given the popularity, I thought the prices were totally reasonable.

Not sure what other negative reviewers expected.   Maybe the wait and hype builds too much expectation or maybe they'd be just as happy with a Dominos pie.    C'mon people, it's pizza- there's only so much oral pleasure you're gonna get.... 

Bottom line, eating at Bianco is as much about the experience and celebrating a guy who's reached the pinnacle of success doing something he loves.   Even if I can only experience that vicariously, I will do so happily.",3,1,4

I really think that you should try this place, man.  Chr1s Bianco & Marc Bianco and the whole Bianco crew are really doing something good for the community and that's the type of restaurant that I want to support.

I like you a lot, Chris E.  And, I think of you as a real friend even though we haven't met yet in real life.  You don't buy into the BS like a lot of other people do, like me, and you've made me a better person and definitely a better Yelper because you challenge me and I really appreciate that, dude.  But sometimes, and I hate to admit this, but sometimes the BS and the hype is right and that's how I feel about Pizzeria Bianco.  And I don't want you to shoot yourself in the foot just to make a point, like I often have, because good pizza is almost as good as good sex . . . almost . . . so please, try Pizzeria Bianco for me.

Currently, Chr1s Bianco & Marc Bianco and crew are building a game-changing facility in LA, and although I probably won't be in this city when it is completed, I'm super excited about it. They also have a great restaurant in SF called Tartine that I have frequented when in the Yay Area.

Here is my Pizzeria Bianco story:

I have not actually been in this restaurant but I have had the pizza.  As my Yelpies\/Yelpers\/Yelpests know, I'm pretty involved in the ""foodie scene"" in LA, so needless to say, I've generally gone above and beyond to have good food.  Whether or not it's ordering Bellota from Spain, Oysters from Connecticut or Crawfish from Louisiana, food is definitely #2 in my life and it has definitely been #1 for many of the people that I've worked for . . .

My last job, which doesn't appear on my resume or LinkedIn or anywhere on my record for that matter, was for a crazy Hollywood Mogul Producer guy who was more than a handful and nothing like the amazing dudes that I currently work with . . . See the movie SWIMMING WITH SHARKS for a reference. Needless to say, this abusive Mogul Producer guy drove out to Arizona to scout for a Film and on the way back to LA, they picked up 7 pizzas from Pizzeria Bianco and found a way to best preserve them in the trunk of their car.

When the team arrived in The LAnd of Dreams, of course it was my job to unpack and when I saw those pizzas, I had to make a decision about what was what in my life.  As you know, career and money take a backseat to the finer things for me, so when I opened the trunk and that gourmet Pizzeria Bianco smell hit me, I knew what I had to do.

I carefully took out the 7 Pizzeria Bianco pizzas, which they had wrapped together in saran wrap and then surrounded in ice packs and I pulled out 2 and threw them in my trunk under a sweatshirt when no one was looking.  I then rewrapped the remaining 5 and placed them on the top shelf in the walk-in freezer in his garage.  He had a ton of security cameras and even a few dudes hanging around his pad, but I've never had a problem getting around any of that and they didn't notice ish.

When I got home around 8pm and hadn't heard anything, I figured I was in the clear, but at 10:30pm (on a Friday night), the Creative Executive called me down to the office for a meeting.  When I got to the parking garage, my pass wouldn't work and that was all the indication that I needed.

I parked on the street, took the stairs up to the office since I couldn't get on the elevator without some sort of activated pass or ID, and when I walked in, our whole team was there waiting for me, along with my replacement.

I knew what was what when they showed me the receipt from Pizzeria Bianco and the 5 remaining pizzas, so I thanked them for the position and quickly left.  No Jerry Maguire ish from me, thaw fo shizzle.

When I arrived back at my pad, the first thing I did was get out my 2 Pizzeria Bianco pizzas and started to figure out how to file for unemployment. I ate everything but the last slice, of which I carefully wrapped in a napkin.  I then wrote out the ransom note from one of his famous movies on 5 napkins & stuck it along with a last slice in the mail the next day.

I've learned not to regret anything and honestly, losing my job for 2 Pizzeria Bianco pizzas was 100% worth it and to this day it's still one of the best things I've had in my mouth along with the Sopressata sandwich from Tartine (& I've dated a lot).

Btdubs, my friends who eat at Pizzeria Bianco all the time say that the entire menu is good.

That's it for now.  Thanks for being a friend, Chris E, and I look forward to your Pizzeria Bianco review, even if it is a 1-star review [wink].

Keep voting with your wallets, kids, and doing what you gotta do to make YOUr life and the community as positive and amazing as possible.  Oh, and only take care of the people who take care of YOU.

At Bianco's you will receive a good, freshly made pizza with natural ingredients that are a cut above those of many Phoenix restaurants.  The setting is pleasant and yes, the owner's dedication to his craft is admirable.  

However, I'm not sure this is worth the hype.  It's definitely a solid pizza, but nothing worth raving over.  To insinuate that this is anywhere close to the best pizza in America is lunacy.  After hearing raves about its near-legendary status, my companions and I were bewildered by the slavish praise.  That's right - no divisions, we were all unanimously confused.  I got everyone to go with me and wait because I swore the place had a magnificent reputation for unique pizzas....I still get grief about how I hyped Bianco to them.  The only explanation I can think of is that the average American palate has become so dulled by the daily intake of synthetic flavors, frozen pap, and junky Domino's-style fixes that fresh food automatically blows their minds by comparison.  

Obviously, the pizza at Bianco's is going to crush anything from a lame corporate chain ála Olive Garden, but that shouldn't be an accomplishment in and of itself.  If that's the extent of your exposure, then yes - Bianco's will rock your world.  On the other hand, if you have a passion for food and some broader exposure to other cities and countries, I'm sure Bianco will seem like what it is: good, yet wholly unremarkable.  And it does have its flaws, such being sopping wet and having a totally soggy crust in the 50% near the center.   Really, instead of waiting needlessly, go to nearby Cibo, which is in a quaint house setting and serves a a solid pizza that is as good with no wait, no hassle, no hype.  

I don't mind waiting: a leisurely pace can be part of a pleasant dining experience....what I don't like is waiting needlessly for something that was supposed to be mind-blowing.  Look, I'm not going to go overboard with a knee-jerk reaction: Bianco is worth trying, just temper your expectations because it's certainly nothing to write home about.",2,1,1

when we checked with the hostess, she told us we had to wait 3 more hours in no uncertain terms.  i always felt this place was over-hyped, but i wanted to taste it for myself to see what all the buzz was about.  our group ended up checking out an asian tapas bar to kill time.  when we came back 2 hours later, the hostess snapped at me like we were supposed to stand there and wait like idiots for the whole 3 hours.   even if we had waited at the bar next door, was there a way she could let us know our table was ready without us checking in with her?  there was no pager system, so forgive me if i'm a bit confused.   i don't believe there is a pizza worth waiting 4 hours for.
that's the problem with pizzeria bianco, the glowing reviews have made them busier than they can handle, and the service does not befit
the best in america rating because the food is still relatively inexpensive pizza and they don't hire servers that are up to par at the elite level. IMHO they should be handing out complimentary antipasti like salumi in seattle and apologizing for the unusually long wait.  but they don't have to, because pheonicians enjoy getting treated like dog crap i guess.  i'll be one person that won't ever go there again.",3,5,2

I've been once on a date, once with a friend who was visiting, and most recently with two friends who were born and raised here but never had the opportunity to go. Oh, and they brought their little baby girl. The third time, the charm as I will begin to refer to it, we waited about an hour and thirty minutes.

The place is a gem. There atmosphere inside the restaurant is intimate and homey. You can see Chris Bianco making the pizzas himself behind the counter and can smell the fire from the wood burning oven. We were greeted by the one and only waiter who is originally from Chicago. He's worked with Bianco for like 13 years, he said. 

We ordered a bottle of wine and three pizzas for us to share. My two fav pizzas from Biancos are the Rosa and the Margharita. The Marg only has sauce and garlic so I added mushrooms. The Rosa has no sauce, cheese, pistachios, and crack. Seriously, the Rosa...I could eat it everyday. The crust is very thin and not heavy. If you're crazy about crust, you won't think this pizza is as amazing as I do. The sauce, I think, is what makes the pizzas so great. Not only that, but the fresh ingredients that are used make the pizza taste just that much better.

Yes, there is a long wait but it's an experience. After 3 bottles of wine shared between three of us (my Mommy friend was being good), we had such a great time chatting it up with our server and enjoying each others company. Why not wait an hour or so for good pizza when it's not anymore expensive that a fully loaded, greasy large pizza from Dominos?

But the Gods were with me and the timing was right (lucky), and we got in first seating at 5 p.m. I had seen the place years ago during a Monday Night Football game between the Bears and Cardinals. You know, the Dennis Green meltdown game. ABC showed video of the dining room as a bumper for commercials, saying it was named best pizza in America, and I imagined it to be a much larger place.

We arrived around 4pm on a Friday and found 20 people lingering outside. By 4:30 the line was down to the Bar Bianco building, which is about another 30 or so people deep. I'm sure everyone is familiar with this issue, so I'll skip to the part where we were the last table seated. Super lucky again.

I've had the Neapolitan pizza before at a place called Spacca Napoli in my hometown, Chicago. While they are very similar, Bianco's has an edge in the toppings department. The Margherita had great tomato flavor and the cheese was certainly one-of-a-kind. Basil was fresh, green and spicy. Some people find the classic pizza to be not to their liking, or generic, but to sell this pizza chefs have to adhere to certain traditions, including using imported flour, oil and an internship in Naples. It's like a flat-bread on steroids. It's not perfect and generally the middle is a little floppy. If you know this going in, it helps.

Probably wouldn't repeat because I can get it at home way easier, although Spacca Napoli gets real busy in the summer. Overall the experience was awesome, and a handshake from the owner\/chef, Chris Bianco, on the way out sealed the deal. You just can't discount that kind of personal attention.",0,0,0

I guess the first thing to start with is that if you don't show up to put your name on the list before this place opens up you can forget about having anywhere near a normal dining experience.

This was our second time there and the first nearly ruined it.  We originally stumbled across this place on a recommendation by some friends that swear it's the best in the country.  It top notch and definitely in the hunt for the top 5, but the wait and process takes a lot from it.  

Normally you'd expect a place that is packed with a waiting list from open to close to want to expand, but this is exactly the reason that this place will always be this way.  You see... They own a little wine bar adjacent that dishes out beer, wine and appetizers to all those waiting to eat there.  And from sitting at the first seating and hearing people told a 3 plus hour wait from the hostess, I feel their pain.

Onto the food... Their fresh mozzarella, tomato, basil and olive was good and highlighted by the top quality olive oil found atop this concotion.

For the pizzas, we have done the same the last two times there - the wiseguy (carmalized onions, fennel sausage on a tomato sauceless pizza) and the biancoverde (ricotta arugula and cheese on a tomato sauceless pizza as well) except we always add the proscutto di parma to it.  Both were terrific and yielded leftovers for us.  In fact, I think the only tomato sauced pizza is the margherita.  

If you plan it right and eat an early dinner or at least plan to stop in near 5 to put youself in the queue, you should enjoy this true Italian style pizza that is so hard to find here in the states.",1,1,1

I came here specifically before the dinner rush on a weekday based on the reputation of being small and crowded. I didnt like the fact that there was only valet parking, but whatever. The staff comes off like Notherners: straight to the point. I ordered half Rosa half Wise Guy. The pizza was a thin crust, but it wasnt a cracker crisp crust. The crust ends all had their own unique characteristics. One piece was doughy, one was firm and chewy, and one was crispy firm. Although some people would be put off by it, I was actually intrigued. Dont worry though, the inner dough was consistent. These are definitely Neapolitan pizzas. These wont be overloaded with toppings at all. What surprised me how it wasn't greasy, yet had a good coating of grease throughout the pizza. The roasted pistachios and smoked sausage were grade ingredients that stand out the moment you eat them. This was also a good sized pizza that I could eat by myself and not feel bloated afterward. Overall, i was impressed.",1,0,0

and consequently attracts herds of people and long waits (no surprisingly). 

but with time to kill before my flight home, 2:30 on a monday seemed like a safe bet to dine without the crowds they are known for. Success! the place was virtually empty.

there is something magical about pizza cooked in a wood fire oven - it really has the best taste.  obviously that great taste stems from the organic ingredients and homemade mozzarella though! and on top of the wonderfully charred outer crust, it comes out in mere minutes. happiness for the A.D.D in us all :)

you can never go wrong with margarita, but for something a bit more unique we decided to get the biancoverde - ricatto cheese on pizza is always a good thing, and the arugula piled on top only added to the deliciousness. It's traditionally served without sauce (server warned when we ordered, which was nice since we didnt realize), but they will add sauce to it if you like. im sure its great as its intended but i enjoyed it with sauce.

we split between 3 of us for 2 slices each. decent for a small meal (since the crust is really thin). saw several people ordering a whole pie for themselves but i think splitting between 2 people is perfect to finish completely and be satisfied.

i was kickin myself we didnt order the caprese salad that comes with their fresh baguettes sliced along with it. so bright, so fresh and delicious-looking.

the chocolate shaved ice was a nice ending...light and airy.

i loved the building, part of the historic buildings in Heritage Square of downtown phoenix. The little garden boxes out front and around the corner are charming.

This is a commitment of time.  There are other pizza places in Phoenix, with perfectly good food.  Biancos though, it's more of an experience.

Expect to spend at least 4 hours here.  1 ish hours waiting to get on the list, and then 2ish hours waiting to get into the restaurant, then an hour of eating.  Why would you want to do that?!  Well, because it's fun.  Make sure you go with a group of people you can have great conversations with.  Go when the weather is fantastic, and make sure you want to have some fun.  I always enjoy waiting in line with a glass of wine from Bar Bianco, which is next door.  You can start your tab over there, and carry it over to the restaurant when you are seated.  After you get on the list, the bar will also keep track of you and inform you when the restaurant is ready for you.

Biancos is located in a quiet, great little section of PHX where there is actual grass and trees.  So waiting will be in a park, where you can stand around and chat with friends and strangers.  I always find myself, and my party chatting it up with the other people in line... we all know we are going to be there for a while, so might as well socialize.  

The food is always amazing.  I've gone several times and have tried most of the menu.  My one bit of advice, always get fresh basil on your pizza.  It's an extra cost, but makes a world of difference, no matter what pizza you get.  The Margarita pizza is still my favorite of them all, it's perfection.

Just go, expect to wait, and try to make the best of it.  It'll be a great time with friends, with wine, pizza, fresh air, and that basil.  :)",4,1,1

What would make it better? Lower the price of each pie $2 or use organic ingredients.  Waive the $5 parking with a $50 purchase.  Serve pizza at the bar next door...I don't really drink-was just passing time and it was cold out.

All were outstanding with the MARINARA being my favorite. Just loved the garlic flavors running through out. 

We should have left and given our table to one of the many waiting to get a seat but we all needed just one more bite, so we ordered up a custom pie, with Tomato Sauce, Ricotta & Prosciutto di Parma. An unconventional mix but great flavors after the wood oven.

With that said and all the hype surrounding this place as a mecca for pizza in the desert I had to try it of course. I attempted on a weekend evening and not a chance. 3 hour wait was not gonna happen for me. The wife and I made another attempt during the early afternoon and was delighted to have no wait. We got right in and started to gaze upon the menu with thoughts of this magical pie wafting its way to our table. 

While we waited for our pizza to arrive I took the time to look over the old brick building and this place had a great atmosphere. With all the wood and brick I got the feeling of comfort and old world artisanal craftsmanship. Like a place out of time....especially in an Arizona desert.

We ended up ordering the Margherita and the Wiseguy ($15 & $18 respectively). Both pizzas came straight out of the hot brick oven and to our table. As we devoured the pies before us I have to say that the wife and I were quite happy. Both were cooked well and very flavorful. I would recommend either. It was a pleasure to have nice wait staff as well.

Final verdict: I would highly recommend Pizzeria Bianco. Its not thee best pizza in the valley but a pretty damn good one. Both pizzas we had were really tasty. I would also recommend going there shorty after they open in the afternoon. It is a far less wait. If you want to make a day of it go for the weekend evenings.

The boyfriend and I rolled in here on a whim since it looked less busy than usual. I love the look of the place. Small, cozy, lined with brick and warm colors. Loud, busy,  but everyone seemed to be having a great time. 

We started off with some bread, oil, and olives. All very good, but it's hard to go wrong with bread and oil. The pizza was where the real litmus test would be. We went for the Sonny Boy, Rosa, and the Wiseguy. The Wiseguy was sort of boring. The sausage didn't have great flavor and I usually love Schreiner's sausages. The Rosa was very interesting--not something I'd eat very tie but definitely worth seeing what the hyper is about. My favorite, the Sonny Boy. How can you go wrong with Salami and olives?

I know there is an endless Cibo vs Bianco debate so I'll jump in to give my two cents. Both are excellent but I'll give Cibo a slight edge. I like the di Notte pizza at Cibo more than any pizza I had at Bianco. Also, I like the variety of things that you can get at Cibo. Although the small menu at Bianco works, I do wish there were more appetizers or desserts to choose from.

Everything on the menu sounded good. This is what my aunt and I ordered. 

Rosa (5 stars) -  The flavor combination was brilliant. I would never think to add pistachios to a pizza. The distinct pistachio flavor transformed with the balanced combination of red onions, parmigiano reggiano, and rosemary. The texture of the crust was yummy and what to expect from a wood burning brick oven. 

Sonny Boy (4 stars) - The toppings on this pizza was a good contrast to the Rosa. The tomato sauce was tasty, and there was just enough mozzarella cheese. They used good quality salami. I'm not huge fan of olives on my pizza, but these olives were delicious. 

Service (5 stars) - The staff was friendly, and we did wait too long for our food. They even offered to take our picture outside since they do take many pictures.

Of course we tried the margherita then went with the wiseguy as we wanted to try a white pizza as well.  Best margherita pizza I've ever had.  I could have done without the wiesguy.  I should have known to stay away from a white pizza but was glad we tried something different.

A couple we met in line suggested we try the Spiedini-Italian Fontina wrapped in Prosciutto di Parma, served warm.  Oh mama was it good.",3,0,0

I was in town for a conference awhile back, but while my flight got in on time, my bag handle broke almost immediately after I started to wheel it.  I managed to keep it together by holding it closer to the ground, and got aggravated talking to several bus drivers who couldn't tell me a damned thing about how to get to the light rail.  A lesser man might've just taken a Super Shuttle to the hotel on the outskirts of Phoenix instead--not me.  I've been to just about every single major pizzeria in the NY-metro area.  I had mapped out the route to what is supposed to be the best pizzeria on the planet--Pizzeria Bianco.  I was going to get there hell or high water.  

So I dragged this bag onto the bus, figured out the light rail system, and then walked a couple of blocks to the pizzeria.  I was struck by how idyllic the street it's on was.  Looking at photos of the building online, it looks like a big, imposing structure.  Instead it's this little village-like area surrounded by the Phoenix science center.  I came in all beat up and the staff was gracious enough to allow me to shove my bag in the back.  I plopped down at my table ready to order (I came at lunchtime so no line).  Thank God it all was not for naught, as Pizzeria Bianco was worth the trip.  

I decided to go with Mr. Bianco's 2 favorite pies: a marinara and a rosa.  Yes, I got 2 pies by myself: fuck you.  Marinara pies are not normally my thing but this one was exceptional.  First off, the crust was light, fluffy with some crispness, significant char from the oven and a certain ""freshness"" to it.  It wasn't one of those old world, rustic, converted-bread recipes that some places in NY have, but it was great in its own right.  The tomatoes used were of the highest quality, and with little spikes of oregano and crisp slivers of garlic, their flavors were brought out to the fullest.  It was as simple a pizza as you can get.  Much more complex and out-of-the-box was the rosa.  It's that same great crust topped with crumbled Arizona pistachios, pecorino romano, red onion, and rosemary.  That sounds weird, but it's fucking incredible.  One of the best single pizzas I've ever had.  Chris has called this pizza his 'the metaphor of me'; I agree to the degree that I can, as this pie is absolute artistry.  I've not had a pizza like it before or since.  Even though a few copycats have popped up, they don't come remotely close.  Then I noticed the man himself walking around, and Chris Bianco came right over to me given what I ordered.  We talked shit about Arthur Ave, the Bronx and baseball stuff for a few minutes, and we ended up talking to another table from Brooklyn.  Chris Bianco is a genuinely great guy living the American dream, and I think it's awesome that he has mad scientist hair because in a good way that's what he is!  I grab a quick picture with him, wrapped up my leftovers and ordered another pie to go (Sonny Boy, great but not as good as the other 2), but then got talked into some homemade chocolate gelato.  I am very glad that I did!  It was exceptional as well, almost a perfect melding of chocolate and extra-icy ice cream but a little more towards the chocolate side.  Considering the heat I was about to walk out into, it was the best idea ever.  

I saw that Chris Bianco added a new Italian restaurant on top of the wine bar, sandwich shop, this pizzeria, and the others that he has opened.  Holy shit do I want to go (to all).  He's a little off the wall, but he knows what he's doing when it comes to restaurants and his passion is almost incomparable.  His story is very reminiscent of other great American success stories and proves that the American dream doesn't die so easily.  High-minded rhetoric aside, Pizzeria Bianco lived up to the hype and is worth going well out of your way for (I'd try to avoid the lines though).  If you're one of the mindless critics on here bashing this place without an actual argument or story to stand on, then fuck you.  You can see my story, and I'm sticking to it.",2,7,5

The food was legit. We only had the pizza's, but they were as good as advertised. It's a little pricey (I think it was $18 for my pizza, the Sonny Boy), but it being so good kind of made up for it.

If you go, I definitely recommend going with a group of ~8-10 people and making a reservation well in advance (I've never been for lunch but I've heard that it's more feasible for that). 

There's a nice beer and wine bar next door (which, I assume, strategically at least doesn't mind that people are waiting a long time to be seated).

As long as you go with a good group of people and consider the waiting to be part of the experience, I don't think you'll be disappointed.

The biggest shame for me is that they don't have patio seating (in Phoenix it's nice enough for that almost year round). That said - it's a beautiful and central location, and if you go when it's a bit chilly out (by Phoenix standards), you probably won't mind eating inside.

I can't bring myself to give it an overwhelmingly positive review (mainly because they're so overrated) but I can say that other than the waiting (which is part of the experience if you're with the right people and not in a rush), I've never been disappointed or had a bad time there.

The Wise Guys hit all the right spots - the sausage was flavor perfection, and don't even get me started on the caramelized onions cut so thick that it was almost an extra layer of meat on the pie. The flavors were so simple, but melded together perfectly.

Hot, chewy, toasty crust with a bit of a pull. Housemade sausage, frsh grown on site vegetables and an incredibaly hot oven help create these gems. If you are a visitor from out of state DO NOT PASS THIS PLACE UP!
 Every pie is great. The fresh fennel and sausage is out of this planet. Enjoy!!
 Please don't let the wait time and snobby people bother you too much. There are some pretentious pricks who wait and feel like they own the joint because they are regulars.....ignore them. Wait...Sit...take your time and enjoy yourself!!",1,2,1

One thing that I enjoyed was the unique toppings for the pizzas.  When first hearing it, pistachios doesn't sound too appetizing on a pizza.  But I assure you, the flavor combinations are great.  Highly recommend the margherita pizza.  Surprisingly, basil works really well on pizza.  The crust is what takes the cake for Pizzeria Bianco. It must be the wood-fire ovens they use.  The crust is crisp and light.  Blends perfectly well with the ingredients.  On top of that , the pizzas aren't too expensive and the rustic atmosphere of the restaurant adds to the experience.

Overall, if you're in Phoenix, you should stop by Pizzeria Bianco.  I hear that it is a 3hr wait.  But it only took me 20 minutes to get a table, so don't get intimated by the wait time.",1,0,0

Foodies all over the world make journeys and take treks to discover a new flavor. They'll go to dangerous places to sample some new or exotic delicacy. 
They'll spend thousands of dollars to have these experiences and spend weeks of planning to do it. Well, that's not me BUT, I did decide one morning to drive 
350 miles for some pizza. I had always heard how the best pizza in the world was in Phoenix, Arizona at Pizzeria Bianco. I live in Los Angeles and have experienced Mozza so many times that I couldn't believe that there was a better slice of pizza anywhere (New York and Chicago included because I've been to both). One Tuesday morning, I woke up at 5 am and decided to hop on the 10 east and settle this once and for all. Bianco is Downtown Phoenix and while it opens at 5 pm I had heard that if you don't stand in line well before then you may not get in for the rest of the night. I arrived at around 2 and there was already someone waiting at the door. In the 3 hours leading up to the door opening the line grew 40 deep and I was glad I had made the early commitment the rosa with arizona pistachios, red onion and parmigiano reggiano was a nice surprise because I didn't expect that combination to work, especially the pistachios. The Wise Guy with fennel sausage, wood roasted onions and smoked mozzarella really hit the spot. While nothing compares to Nancy Silverton's Mozza dough, Bianco's topping combinations are inspired and 
perfectly balanced. The perfect pizza would be a fusion of the two and for THAT I would travel a million miles.",3,1,3

This place is just ok...nothing to brag about, and definately not worth the 2-4 hour wait.

6pm...arrived...put a table for 4 on the list

7pm...hunger set in we ate cheese and had a beer next door...the cheese is by far the worst tasting cheese ever.  (but i am no fine cheese connoisseur)...beer was great

8pm...did nothing...still hungry...played games 8 games of solitare and bubble breaker on cell phone

9pm...sat and placed an order for 4 different pizzas

9:45pm...took the first bite and thought there is nothing special about it...took a second bit and said the freshness of the ingredients was grand.  The quality of ingredients were really good.  The crust burnt, the dough tasted nothing more than naan at an indian restaurant cooked in a clay oven.  Sauce fresh tasting...cheese far better than the shit next door.

10pm...got bored of the pizzas decided to try others...sadly same effect.

all in all this place is okay, is it worth 3 hours...NO.  is it better than little ceasar's YES...

personally BJ's Pizza and Brewery, Nello's, Oregano's, Grimaldi's, and especially Spinato's is far better, and you have less of a wait at any of these places...

why the long wait then?  cause the place is tiny, maybe 25 seats, and an hour and a half to two hours dining time...plus media hype

why the good reviews?  cause after 4 hours of hunger and or boozing even taco bell's mexican pizza would be the best thing you ever tasted that night.

Needless to say Jack Bauer does more in 4 hours...and this is 4.5 hours I will never get back.",6,8,6

Flew in from Florida, made reservations for a group of 8, waited over three hours, got yelled at and disrespected on multiple occasions by the hostesses... we were asked to wait across the street at bar during the 3 hours; appetizers and drinks were what held us over. Once they got around to call us in for our table, they refused to seat all of us because only 7 of the 8 group members were present in the courtyard. We went and got the eighth person, who had a chicken wing and a drink in hand from the other bar-- yelling ensued courtesy of the hostesses (?owner) claiming that ""this isn't a damn food court."" We should have left, but given the investment in time, we went ahead and stayed.

Food was decent, definitely not worth the hype. Wait staff were actually pleasant. Restaurant itself was quite hot and humid (obviously because of the oven).

Went here awhile back on a hot and very humid August evening with a group of ten.  We had reservations for 8p- we arrived at 7p (as was requested by the venue), and tried to keep cool at the very crowded and NON-air conditioned Bar Bianco next door- very quaint, but the overhead fans and open windows were laughable- funny that no one was laughing.

Yes, we arrived at 7p and were seated at 8:15 and glasses of water were quickly given.  Orders for salads and pizzas were taken fifteen minutes later.  Salads were on the table by 8:45p and pizzas around 9p.  (Hey, I was ready to eat at 7p, so yeah, I was watching the clock!)

I ordered the Farmer's market salad and the Rosa pizza (with parmigiano-reggiano, rosemary, red onion, and AZ pistachios).  Fantastic salad- tasted very fresh with a lovely vinaigrette- the shaved parmigiano-reggiano on top was the icing on the cake!  I'm a thin-crust lover and was impressed with the pizza crust here.  Loved the scent and flavor of rosemary, and the toasted pistachios really brought the flavors of the other ingredients together and made them pop!

Worked out perfect though, arrived at just about 4pm to see a hand full of people waiting and the the restaurant didn't open till 5pm.  After a short debate we decided to stay, it helped that there was ample shade.  The wait while hot was not uncomfortable and for the most part, newbies and veterans honored each others arrival order.  40 seats is not much for a place that does this much business and it was surprising to learn that most waiting were from out of town.  I also learned that reservations are accepted on line for parties of 6 to 10 and only 3 reservations per night.  Reservations are usually 1 1\/2 to 2 months out.  Luckily for us there was only one reserved table for 10 ahead of everyone.  5 o'clock rolled around and the loading procedure ran smooth as clock work and we had drink and food orders in by quarter after.  Service was excellent and fast with just the right amount of time between salad and main course.  I could not have asked for much more from my food, maybe a bit more basil on my mozzarella and tomato salad, everything was amazing including my Mexican coke.  We ordered 2 pizzas, both wood fire baked to perfection.  I could have eaten a whole loaf of the bread that comes with the salads, or for $2 on its own.  None of our food was greasy or soggy, the olive oil they use is excellent and the fresh mozzarella mouth watering.  I will go back again, planning on getting there an hour before opening.

Might be great for area - but I've had better Neapolitan pizza in the US (including my favorite little place back home Pupatella). I did get to introduce my friend to Neapolitan style pizza - something he'd never had - but not sure I'd do the hour plus wait here again.

We ended up sitting at the bar since that's what opened up first and the bartender was great and didn't mind me practicing my Italian on him. I loved the house made mineral water. The toppings are all top rate on the pies, the sauce fragrant and flavorful, but alas the cheese and crust were a little disappointing - the crust in particular lacked flavor). 

Our pies:
MARGHERITA - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil (my staple for judging any Neapolitan pizzaiola's offerings - Really would never get this again; very disappointed in this pie)

SONNY BOY - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, Gaeta Olives (solid pie - great toppings make up for the flavor-lacking crust)

WISEGUY - Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage (best we had - perfect blend of flavors and aromas)

Plus it had been written up as one of the great pizza joints in the west.  So I went with an open mind when attended the Phoenix Film Festival in March.

Wow!  Was I completely disappointed. I tried two pies: the Margherita and the pistachio pie, which came highly recommended.  I would rank them about a 3 on scale of 10.  The sauce on the Margherita was bland and unexciting.  The cheese honestly tasted stale.  And the crust was like a bad imitation of typical NYC pizza.  Except dry and uninviting.  It was dry yet undercooked.  Go figure.  While the pistachio pie had an interesting flavor, the crust once again destroyed any pleasure I could get from the meal.

I was there with a friend from LA who felt that even by LA's miserable pizza standards, Bianco was a cut below.

What is this alien breed of pizza thing? Magic. 

Though limited, the beer selection was tasty and the Nut Brown would go well with any  of these brick-toasted crusts.

The salads? For the Caprese of home made mozzarella was fabulous, the cheese salty but not offensive, the tomatoes ripe and complimentary. And the Farmers Market salad, though perhaps heavy on the white balsamic, a tossing of delight with a citizenry of flavors (gorgonzola, red onion and bread crumbs atop the delicious bite of escarole.

We arrived at 4:45 behind at least 12 other parties.  So I knew we'd wait quite a while.  Seeing that there were at least 6 tables on the patio and one long picnic style table between the pizzeria and the wine bar next door, I was frustrated to have to wait to dine inside and asked why we couldn't dine outside.  The answer was simply if they served more parties the quality of the food would be compromised.  So I remained patient.  We went to the wine bar next door and had a few glasses of wine.  Our Phoenix relative met us there and took us to the pub across the street.  We had a few beers while one of us went back to the pizzeria every 45 minutes to check on our wait status.  Finally after 2 and a half hours we were called in to dine.  The building was first a machine shop from the early 20th Century.  So of course it's got an interesting character.  We were seated in the back of the building where behind a tall counter the owner throws his pizza crust and fires it in the large brick kiln which apparently came from Italy.  First up an order of wine.  While they're selection is fairly diverse it's not great.  So I order some decent wines and sip a bit while we wait for our pizza.  We ordered a Rosa, a Wiseguy and a MARGHERITA.  I tried to order my pizzas with easy cheese as I always do.  Pizza always comes with way too much cheese that is usually not the best quality.  Everyone in my party urged my not to do this.  I'm glad I listened to them!  Just enough cheese on every pizza.  The pizzas were made with such balanced flavors.  The Rosa was my favorite!  I think it was either drizzled with a little olive oil which brought the different flavors together.  The fresh herbs with the and cheese were complimented by the sweet onion with delightful crunch added by the delicious Arizona pistachios!  The crust was perfect!  Thin enough not to overwhelm the flavors of the well designed ingredients yet just thick enough at the end of each slice to add a crispy finish to a delightful experience.  I really don't think my review does true justice for Pizzeria Bianco.  One must experience it for oneself to see how spending 3 hours to eat pizza could be one of the best dining experiences ever!

We were fortunate to be there on a mild spring day, a slower day, chose to eat around three (between busier times of lunch and dinner), and brought cards to play while we waited. Waiting was a pleasure. What a surprise, though, I think not typical. 

After having eaten there, and enjoyed it (my fav was the Sonny Boy, even though I don't care for those olives) I'd have to say I wouldn't rush to go back for a longer (or hotter!) wait at peak times. I would go back off peak with just me and the hubs, as I'm not sure everyone in our group of 14 was as enthusiastic. The hostess was fabulous and sweet, our server, while adequate, could've worked on his interpersonal skills. Take a cue from the hostess, dude. 

The complimentary house bread and olive oil was very good. I didn't get to try the Rosa, maybe next time, but we did sample the Speidini appetizer (try splitting that 12 ways! Haha No, don't, it ends up being just a bite) which everyone seemed to enjoy. Come on, it's meat and cheese on a stick in a wood-fired brick oven. Can't lose. :)

Cute little place, with friendly staff. Thankfully we  didn't have to wait very long (plus!) and the food came out pretty quickly (double plus).  I ordered a mixed local greens salad (literally just mixed greens and vinaigrette) and my friends ordered something similar to mine, but it had skewered salami\/cheese on top.  All three of us were happy with our starter, and then came the pizzas.

I ordered The Marinara (marinara and garlic no cheese) and added organic roasted mushrooms for three bucks.  It was quite tasty and I ended up eating the ENTIRE pizza.  Don't judge me, I was hungry.  My one friend ordered the pizza with pistachios and onion and I can't remember what friend number two ordered (oops), but they were both pleased as punch with their pies.

The tomato puree is not like the real Italian tomato taste and seems flavored with sugar and citric acid, I don't know it just tastes funny.  I spend two months a year in the heart of naples and this is a very different tasting pie.  Even the mozzarella lacks the natural flavor and is so white as if it is bleached.

The Sonny Boy had the most wonderful olives on it... even if you don't like olives, you will like this pizza.

Probably one of my favorite foods and because I travel a lot for work I always try to check out the local pizza place. Ever since moving to Tempe 2 years prior I had seen that Pizzeria Bianco was a highly rated pizza place in Phoenix. Over 1k reviews and a famous chef...needless to say I had been wanting to go here in a bad way, but just never had found the time or a reason to go. Pizza craving kicked in and in no mood to cook...this was the day! Woot! When we arrived I was surprised to see how small the place is. I had heard there are long lines to get in and now I could understand why. We got there at the perfect time though and were seated immediately. It was an early dinner. Needless to say that before we left, the line started forming outside. As we were seated we were handed the menu. Is this all? 1 page? Ok well that definitely makes it easier to order. Only 6 pizza choices really? At first this seems disappointing, but keep in mind these are 6 pizzas that you probably wont see at most places. Hmm even though there were only 6, I wanted to try all of them! Dang it! Our solution was to order 2 pizzas and get them both half and half...4 flavors covered! These are the 4 we tried: SONNY BOY (Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, olives); MARGHERITA
(Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil); MARINARA
(Tomato Sauce, Oragano, Garlic (No Cheese)); and WISEGUY
(Wood-Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage). I didn't get to try the Biancoverde or the Rosa, but I vow to go back for those. All 4 pizza flavors were great, but the one that stood out the most was the Sonny Boy. My only complaint is the price of the pizza. Yes it was good, but it wasn't the best I've ever had and they weren't huge pizzas. Pizza in places like New Haven, CT is just as good, yet much cheaper. Or I've even been to Neopolitan pizza places that had amazing pizza for a lower price. I feel that they charge you a premium for the Bianco brand experience of pizza.

Of course, adding those toppings to any pizza would make it great, but I like the way the edges of the meat get slightly burnt and the prosciutto covers the entire slice.  The bread by itself is worth getting... super light, airy, nutty, and fruity all at the same time!  We got there way before opening and were the next to get in when the restaurant filled.  But, no big deal, went to the bar next door and got called to the restaurant in an hour.  The bar has 2 drafts and 6 bottles.  The restaurant has a crappy beer selection... one draft only?!  Losing major points for that... pizza and beer is a great combo and they're missing out on the opportunity to sell beer.  It's a cool building and I respect the pizza makers...

There seem to be a few people that don't understand the hours of waiting required to get a taste.

I started off with their mozzarella and tomato salad. This was good but typical. Slices of mozzarella with slices of tomato, drizzled with olive oil, salt and pepper. It was a nice refreshing way to start off my meal. 

Then I got their pizza- half Margherita and half Rosa. Delicious!!! The Margherita tasted pretty typical, nice fresh tomato sauce with basil and mozzarella on top.

I would actually give it a 4* for taste, but a 3* for value. I must say though, our server was great, just how I think excellent servers should be. He told us his recommendations and his favorites with his own personal twists. 

We ordered the antipasto, margherita + fennel sausage, biancoverde + prosciutto, and since we weren't full yet (there were 3 of us) we got the sonny boy + mushrooms. 

The antipasto was very delicious. I would recommend! Great mixture of veggies and cheese and olives.  

The best rec from our server was the biancoverde + prosciutto. That's his ultimate fav and that was our ultimate fav! Too bad we didn't end with it. Maybe if we did, I'd push this up to 4* ;) (It is a must try! Flavorful and fresh ingredients. Superb!) We ended with the sonny boy and that was a big of a disappointment. Both my hubs and I didn't care for the Gaeta olives on the pizza. It was also a bit salty too. But we dont' regret trying something different. I do wish we would have just gotten the margherita alone instead of adding the fennel sausage. I wasn't a fan of the sausage. I think I would have liked it just normal. 

Our last pizza, the sonny boy came out a bit burnt. Felt like that was a little unacceptable. 

We didn't have a wait which was great and while we were there it didn't seem like there was a long way. Just depends on the day and hour. Not sure how often I would come back. Glad that I tried it at least once though.

We got there 4:40PM and waited in line for 20 minutes for the place to open to put our name down on the list. After that, we waited another hour and 40 minutes to be seated. Total wait time was 2 hours.

We were sat at the bar because we said we would take first available seat. It turned out to have the waiter in front of you which means real good service.

We ordered Antipasto, tomato and mozzarella salad, Magharita pizza, and Wiseguy pizza. After we ordered, the waiter asked us if we've been there before because we ordered the best things on the menu which made me feel pretty good.

Well, the moment of truth to justify our big detour to try this pizza place finally came when they delivered all this food we ordered. Antipasto was very good, the grilled vegetable was so fresh and sweet. Tomato and mozzarella was excellent, the fresh mozzarella was so good. The pizza which we drove 6 hours and waited 2 hours for??? Were they good?? Yes! they were very good. The crust was the best we ever had. It was light, fluffy, crispy and thin. The sauce on Magharita was so tasty. And you know what? they were not even made by the famous chef Chris Bianco. That's right, we saw him only briefly for couple minutes and he went hiding for most of the time we were dining.

During the dinner, we heard one patron sitting at the bar asked the guy next to him ""was it worth it?"" If he had asked me, I would've said ""no"".

Enjoy a good bottle of vino and laugh with friends in a great atmosphere. Nothing negative to say about my experience or the food. Go and enjoy a delightful evening!

Best advice about this style of pizza: 

-If you are a Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, or Dominos type of pizza lover you may not enjoy the pizza in the same manner. 

- If you are someone who enjoys a more traditional italian roots style pizza you will not be disappointed. Bianco did a great job creating a delicious signature style pizza. Two thumbs up!!!",0,0,0

However, since it was my day off, and they were just around the corner from the Arizona Science Center, I went head and took a gander.

I wasn't really that hungry so I ordered the smallest pizza on their menu. I chose the Marinara, which is a 12"" pizza with marinara sauce on a crust with no cheese. It took some adjusting, but it was actually delicious. I didn't really miss the cheese, and I actually got to enjoy the crust even more than normal. I really did enjoy it!

I emphasize that because the waitress thought that I didn't enjoy my meal because I only ate two slices. I proceeded to explain to her that I wasn't really that hungry and I was also in a hurry. What I didn't tell her was that I also got several phone calls from work that was an unwelcome interruption and that pretty much ruined my appetite for anything after that.

In any case, it was a good lunch repast, and was well worth the $15 (including drinks) that I paid for it.

I am going to try to eat her again when my schedule is less obtrusive and I am much more ravenous. Perhaps then, I will really get to enjoy their offerings.",0,0,3

Yes it was fresh but for the price certainly not worth it, probably had 50 Cents worth of topping on a $18.00 pizza.    Wonder if James Beard got the same pizza's we were served.

Hi, Norma.

I've lived in the Valley for my entire life and have eaten here just under 5 times, probably. I went last night for the first time in 2 + years. It was good! I mean, I won't take the weight of the hype and so forth, because the atmosphere is incredibly charming, the service is dependable and kind, and the food is fresh, mostly local, and very handcrafted. Quite frankly, there's not much in this town that brings so much local flavor and independence to cuisine as PB does. 

That said, the menu doesn't offer much variety, probably for the same reason it's the champion of slow-cooking and primarily local-based. The wine list is fantastic, and, yes, you will be waiting. So don't bring your first date, don't bring the girlfriend you're trying to get rid of, bring your homies who you can talk shit with for hours on end, because it's very possible you're looking at a 3 hour experience, 2 of which are spent outside of the restaurant.",3,6,3

I am astonished with all the negative reviews this place is getting because of the ""long wait."" So here it is, I have been coming here with my husband and friends for a couple years now and never once have we ever had a bad experience. Yes, there is a longer wait than usual, but make the best of it. You're here to have fun, enjoy lively conversations with friends, and just enjoy yourself. If you're in a hurry to get out of there, this is not the place to go. First thing first, if going on a Friday or Saturday night, show up no later than 4:30. The place doesn't open up till 5 o'clock, but you want to get in line early so the hostess can take your name. As my husband is waiting in line, I usually grab a glass of wine and get him a beer. I typically grab a table while he's waiting in line. So once the doors open the line moves fairly quickly, once she grabs your name, let her know where you'll be sitting. Usually a quarter of the people that were waiting leave anyway because they're shocked about the wait. So that bumps you up a couple of spaces. So once that happens, we usually order an app or two if we're with friends and have a great time!  Time flies when you're having fun, so make the best of it. As many times as I've been there, I don't think we've waited more than three hours. Big deal anyway, good wine, good food, good company makes it all worth it. So once you're ready the hostess comes to get you and seats you right away. The staff is always pleasant and friendly. I suggest the caprese salad, the best!! All these pizzas are delicious, Try them all! The bread is fresh and warm, the pizzas are packed with flavor in every bite, I love it. It's a wonderful experience, I suggest going there when you're not in a rush and go with a group. By the way, if you have a group of more than 6 you can make reservations, and no you don't have to do it a month in advance. Just be sure to do it a couple days before.

Service was good and fast. The only bummer was that you have to valet and the restaurant charges an additional $3 (not including tip) to ""validate"" parking. Validation means the restaurant pays for your parking if you buy from them so if you have to pay for it, it should be called parking FEE, not parking validation. Just my opinion, but I don't think it's proper etiquette to charge your restaurant guests for parking.",0,1,0

As a result, if you don't have a reservation, the wait is typically an hour or more any time between 5pm & close.  This is not an issue as A) You can make a reservation and have no wait and B) Bar Bianco is a separate establishment next door that handily accommodates the hungry and waiting crowd with great craft beers and wines.  Bar Bianco is, by the way, a separate review :)

I want to be very up front about the pizza I have experienced here.  Having had two of the six pizzas on the menu, it is good, not great.  It is, in my opinion, not the ""Best"" pizza in Phoenix.  It's not even the best pizza in downtown Phoenix.  On this most recent visit, my Wise Guy + shrooms was mediocre, with an unremarkable flavor and an unremarkable crust.  The ""Spiedini"" appetizer (Fontina wrapped in Organic Prosciutto), however, was simple, delicious and the highlight of my meal.  They have a nice wine selection and a few good beers.  

I liked Pizzeria Bianco for the atmosphere, it's upscale, trendy and loud with a lively bar of its own.   It's happening.   Inside is a relatively compact space, and there's outdoor seating that's great for cooler evenings. It's a good vibe.  

But there's one final thing:  churn.   They know they have a lot of traffic trying to get in that door, they know there's more money to be made.  Previously, I didn't feel like it was an issue, but our server certainly let us know it on this visit.  I don't think I have felt more pressured to finish and vacate my table in a very long time.  

In close, it's the letdown of mediocre pizza and the pushy service that led me to a 3 star review this time.",8,3,2

I ate at the Pizzeria about a year ago while on a business trip here. We were there on a Wed. night at 7pm. the wait was stated to be two hours. We patiently waited and eagerly indulged in wine and conversation to pass the time...all the while I was thinking in the back of my mind that this had better be some flipping orgasmic pizza. And I mean the kind of orgasm that curls your toes and gives you the goose bumps and makes you feel like you are going to have a panic attack good. Well after waiting, drinking and conversing for over two hours we were seated and quickly ordered. When the food arrived I was fairly hammered and liberal with my opinions. I proceded to dish forth my opion and was quickly kicked under the table by my business partner because apparantly speaking poorly of Biancos Pizza to a Phoenician is similar to telling the Pope that Jesus doesnt think that it is cool for his Priests to touch little boys. Well I really didn't think that it was special. Don't get me wrong it is very well executed and very tasty pizza but not two and a half hours good. 

This episode was running through my mind while I was enjoying my favorite pizza in SF at Pizetta 211.  I almost shot the slice of pizza with the perfectly cooked sunny side up organic egg and baby arrugula through my nose. Well now that I am living in Phoenix I just want to stand up and apologize to all Phoenicians that I don't think that Bianco is the ""Prince of Pizza"" or the ""Godfather of Pizza"" or the ""Messiah of Pizza"". I just think that he makes a solid wood fired pizza nothing more nothing less. Sorry guys don't hate me.",5,3,3

I am writing this to bring your attention to the rudeness of your hostess that was working 2\/19\/11. If you have more than 1 hostess let me narrow it down for you, short dark hair and glasses. I myself am a business owner and no matter how great your product is, amazing customer service is also an integral part of the the overall experience. I have dined at your establishment twice and both time the food was delicious even if the wait was long. 
Back to the night at hand. My boyfriend and I stopped by after dining elsewhere in hopes of grabbing a pie to enjoy the next day. We were holding the door open for those that were exiting, those that were being ushered in to their seats and those that were putting their name on the waiting list. When there was a lull said hostess says ""Yes?"" Not, ""How may I help you?"" or ""Hi"" or anything that could be construed as gracious, friendly, hostessish. My boyfriend states that we were looking to get a pizza to go. Miss Crab-Apple, my new moniker for her, states, no haughtily sniffs, ""We don't DO orders to go when there are people waiting."" Then she turns and walks away. She doesn't even ask us if we want to put our names down for a table. 
Mr. Bianco we didn't know what your kitchen's policy is for takeout, maybe you should have a sign that is in huge letters right on the door: NO TAKEOUT WHILE OTHERS WAIT! I am sure that would clear it up for those of us that simply wanted to spend our money on your food, just not eat it there. 

Thank you for your time, 
D'Lisa Shayn",15,14,3

I can hardly believe it, but I finally ate at Pizzeria Bianco, one of America's most famous and highly rated pizzerias. 

After 5 different and failed attempts to try a slice of Oprah's favorite pizza, I contemplated a plan to get in by calling on behalf of a cancer stricken girl with only a month to live and one dream: To eat at Pizzeria Bianco. 

Instead, I took someone's advice and made sure I got there early on a Friday night. And when I say early, I mean not early enough because at 3:45pm, there were already 50 people ahead of me. Estimated wait time? 2 hours!!! And did I mention I got there at 3:45pm and his doors don't even open until 5pm? 

2.5 hours later...to be exact, I was seated. Browsing through the simple menu, I decided to start with the Spiedini. The Italian Fontina cheese wrapped in Prosciutti was a little too rich for me. As for the pizzas-did you catch the plural? I decided to order all 6, yes 6 of the listed pizzas. 

I figured the chances of me waiting another 3 hours to get into Pizzeria Bianco were slim to none so I better order all of them and get it done! Efficiently, with the help of my BF, we finished 4.5 26"" pizzas out of the 6 pizzas in one seating (the Margherita, Marinara, Rosa, Sonny Boy, Biancoverde, and Wise Guy). Told you I could throw down :) The tables beside us were either disgusted or shocked. Out of the 6, my favorite was the Marinara pizza. It stole my heart with its boastful, yet simple flavors of just 3 ingredients-tomato, garlic and oregano. The Rosa was my least favorite because of the overwhelming amount of onions. Being a meat lover, I was disappointed with the protein shakes...I mean pizzas. They were Hoover-daming and drenched with oil. Not sure if they're always like that or if it was just our order? I prefer my pizzas to be moist, not drenched. 

Overall, Pizzeria Bianco has amazing dough and tasty pizzas. I don't think it lives up to its hype taking into consideration the ridiculous wait time and my hunger pangs. But it IS an experience-to be able to try such a famous restaurant located in our own backyard. I'd return...as long as someone else stands in line. I've already taken one for the team.",9,7,4

A simple Italian eatery set amidst south western mesas that outline the horizon, cacti, and bone-dry 100 degree weather.

One would not be quick to assume that this is the place where some of the finest pizza in the continental U.S. is made. An almost hour-long wait and the anticipation seemed to recreate a familiar occurrence. If there was something New Yorkers did well, it was they knew how to wait. The scenario is a familiar one. We wait for trains, the post office, our coffee, and the list can go on and on. Thus, waiting for a table at a prized eating location was no encumbrance at all. Especially if you did not have reservations on hand.

My dining partners in crime were peers I had just met at the AIGA Pivot Design Conference. Their anticipation for a memorable meal was just as apparent as mine and our other fellow pending diners, mostly other conference attendees. To disregard the need to wax lyrical about this experience would be inappropriate. While the restaurant boasts house made country bread, luxuriously delicate olive oil, makes their own mozzarella and has an herb garden in their backyard--I would like to address the pizza.

Every disc that emerges from Bianco's prized brick oven is a delicious discourse amongst ingredients that know a thing or two about savoir faire. They do not argue brashly. Rather, they express a point of view that does not over extend its stay and courteously assent to the other players in the game. This decorum is best exemplified in the Rosa, an intimate gathering of Arizona pistachios, red onion, Parmigiano Reggiano and rosemary. This is umami in its finest moment, oozing with salty pungency that is brilliantly composed. The crust was a juggle of thinness and chewiness that maintained a hearth char but a yielding surface for the ingredients to shine.

Bravo Phoenix!",4,0,2

I had a visitor from out of town and wanted to show off what some magazine touted as ""the best pizza in America"".  Heritage square is darling and I love the vibe down there.  However, we had to wait 2 hrs. for a table.  Of course we were steered next door to their little overflow bar to wait for our table.  We got drunk and ordered several small plates out of ravenous hunger during our wait..... to the tune of 50 bucks.  It's really a brilliant concept Pizzeria Bianco has down there.  Send 'em next door forever til they've spent 2x as much as they would have if they'd just gone to the restaurant.  When we were finally seated and received our pizzas, they were very good.  I have nothing to complain about except they were a bit overpriced.  The last city I lived in has a pizza place called Punch.  You can order take out from Punch and because the ovens are so hot, the pizzas only take like 3 mins. to cook. You are in and out of there quickly. .....even if you choose to dine in.  It's not as fabulous as Pizzeria Bianco, and it has counter service, but their pizza is every bit as good.  They have my beloved Buffalo mozzarella and the pies are half the price.

Both pizzas were a little disappointing. Very good certainly, but not out of this world. I still remember chomping into my first Wiseguy in the early nineties; how qualitatively better it tasted than any previous pizza.  How explosive flavors mingled in my mouth and how my companion and I raved at how awesome it was after, literally, every bite. 

None of that happened this time. Sure, the competition has dramatically stepped up but I say, respectfully, that the product has slipped a little. My outer crust was burnt, pretty badly actually. Some wood oven char is expected and I dont normally even eat the ring,  but do wonder if Chris would've served this had he been on site. Companion's pie touted basil as a topping, but came with a tiny decorative leaf or two in the center. Disappointing. 

Their olive oil is heavenly. Addictive. I'd lick it off Russell Pearce if that was an option. The caprese salad, drenched in that stuff, is a first class oral shindig. 

The Anglo fellow tending Bar Bianco and Hispanic gentleman manning our restaurant bar both exuded the gentle, professional charm that makes dining out a pleasure. The hostess team was competent, but that whole dance of loitering inside a busy little restaurant to identify and engage them has always felt awkward to me. I guess I'm just shy and would prefer they stand under a spinning, electric umbrella, blinking ""H-O-S-T-E-S-S"".

But seriously, getting there 3:30 or so, now that they're open continuously from lunch, will reduce the legendary waits. That's a good thing, because regardless of the gloried past or my recollection of it, this is still a distinctive and mostly charming destination.",4,3,1

Unfortunately (or fortunately I suppose), I actually did like Pizzeria Bianco. While I cannot say it was the best pizza I have ever ate, it was good and I walked away a pleasantly full and happy gal.

To avoid having my opinion of Pizzeria Bianco swayed one way or the other by a potential 3 hour wait, and since I don't feel like any food is worthy of a 3 hour wait, I went with a group of 6 friends and made a reservation. My biggest advice if you are going to make a reservation, make it way before the date you want to go! It took three times calling for a reservation before I got one...last night the hostess shed some light on why...they only take one reservation for each time slot. If you do decide to go without a reservation, take advantage of drinks and apps beforehand at either Bar Bianco or Rose and Crown!

Pizzeria Bianco is small and tables are very close together, so if you don't like dining almost on top of the table next to you, I suggest skipping this place. Our waiter was friendly and provided good service most of the night. Coke comes in the old fashioned bottles and the alcohol selection is a bit small, but I guess the focus is really the food. Our group started with an order of the spiedini (fontina wrapped in prosciutto) and an order of the tomato and mozzarella as appetizers. Definitely if you are with a group, order at least two of the spiedini, as it only comes with two skewers which only affords each person a very small bite. The tomato and mozzarella fed our group easily, so one order for a group of 6 should be fine. The tomatoes were so fresh and juicy, and the mozzarella was super fresh as well...all and all, it was probably the best caprese I have had. Both appetizers were winners with our group. We also went through two plates of the bread and olive oil before our pizzas arrived...my only complaint was that I prefer when restaurants put a bit of seasoning in the olive oil to kick the flavor up a bit.

We ordered five pizzas...2 Biancoverdes, 1 Margherita, 1 Rosa, and 1 Sonny Boy. We probably should have just gone with four pizzas, but with five, we had leftovers for some people to take home. I really enjoyed the Biancoverde and the Margherita, although the Biancoverde was by far the heaviest of the pizzas and had intense flavors. It had a bit too much argula for my liking, but it was very good. The margherita was simple, yet tasted very fresh and had a good cheese to tomato ratio, which is very important in my book for a quality Margherita. The Rosa and Sonny Boy were hits with our group as well, although I think the Sonny Boy was probably the least favorite of the four kinds we ordered. For the two appetizers, five pizzas, a glass of wine, a coke, double expresso, and a cappucino, our bill came to $111...when we added in the tip, each person in our party of 6 paid $22. I thought that was incredibly reasonable and actually much less than I had been planning to spend.

There were a few negatives about my Pizzeria Bianco experience:
1. Parking - the lot for PB customers was full when I arrived at 5:30 pm, so I was directed to the garage on 5th Street which was fine. However, even after getting my ticket validated at PB, it still cost me $3 to park. Not a huge thing, but I think that people turned away from the lot (which is free) should be told that they will still have to pay to park at the garage, just at a discounted rate.

2. When we arrived at 6:30 (time of our reservation), we had to wait for 15 minutes for a table. Granted, not a three hour wait, but it just irks me a bit when you have reservations for a specific time and then are still made to wait.

3. The table of two guys next to us were asked to leave by the hostess...she told them they could finish their beers outside or next door, but they had to leave so a party of two could be seated at their table. I have never heard of something like that happening before. Our group was a bit shocked and as my friend said, ""I guess to be a hostess here you need to have quite a pair"". 

4. After we got our check, we waited over 15 minutes for someone to take it and bring the change (we paid in cash). Our waiter never actually came and got it...the hostess overheard us wondering when someone was going to come and get our money, so she picked it up and handled it for us. The funny thing was that there was a group waiting for our table outside! 

Overall, I would say Pizzeria Bianco is a 3.5 star establishment, but I'm giving it 4 stars (Yelp really needs half stars!) because the food exceeded my expectations in terms of quality and freshness, and our group walked away quite happy with our dining experience despite a few hiccups.",4,3,4

I mean, it's definitely fresh and good but I'm glad I didn't have to wait too long to get in. I have had better pizza before. for sure.

We were quoted a 45 minute to hour wait. No problem, we chilled at the bar next door and played a make shift game of chess. Just as I was about to stomp my brother's king we were called in. It hadn't even been ten minutes. What luck!

The place was swamped and the staff was clearly working very hard. For that reason we lost a little bit of the personal touch. I hate when I ask for something and it feels like I'm a burden. Still, they were very efficient. 

We shared a small salad and the margherita pizza. I very much wish we had had one of the more unique options but Davis doesn't like white pizza. Ahwell. The food came out in a reasonable time and we dug in. It was not a cheap pizza. It was about sixteen dollars for one a little bigger than a plate. But it was clearly very fresh ingredients. And very thin but good crust. The salad was uninspired. It was only lettuce and a few olives tossed in dressing. 

Yes, the pizza is good but I really wouldn't wait very long for it. And I don't have a problem waiting for food at all! This one just wasn't very fulfilling.",5,3,4

Arizona is honored to host such a superb artisan as the master chef who owns and operates this place. If you come to Phoenix, this is the one place that truly matters to go to.
The wait is ridiculous, and for any other restaurant save a hand-full (such as Ruth's Chris for instance), the wait would be intolerable. For this pizza, however, the wait makes perfect sense. I literally spent over 3 hours out of my 18th birthday waiting in line for this place (I had already been here many times before), and I honestly don't think I would've rather done anything else with that time.
The pizza here has been voted the best pizza in the world by the Travel Channel, by Bon Appetit Magazine, and by (the most meaningful in my book, since it's a slap in the face to every cocky New Yorker) the New York Times. With worldwide recognition and universal praise by critics, this is a landmark in Arizona. I love this pizza, and this restaurant, every time I go there without fail.
For me, the Wise-Guy pizza is the best thing in the world. They start with the best brick fired crust you can find here, in New York, or even in Italy. Then they go for some salty house smoked mozzarella (it's one of their sauce-less pizzas), add some wood roasted petals of onion, then top it off with some homemade, hand-spiced fennel sausage. Oh yeah... the pizza is that good. But, that's just my personal favorite, they have 6 pizzas to choose from with 6 extra toppings you can put on. Doesn't sound like a lot? Well.. this isn't Cici's. This is art, PB doesn't need a menu full of novelty pizzas to make it. They have a short list of perfect Italian Pies that need nothing, and leave you wanting nothing. By offering little, they offer specialized, immaculate pizza to their patient clientele. 
This place is a singularity in the way-overdone pizza business. The chef and his brother have a garden where they personally grow all the herbs, spices, and some of the toppings for their pizza. This place is one of the few places on the West coast to have an old-school wood fire brick oven (they are in Heritage Square in Phoenix and are in a historic building, so it was grandfathered in). Another quirk is that every morning they make 500 balls of dough to be made into exactly 500 pizzas that night. And when they make all 500 pizzas, they close shop and go home. They even slightly change their dough recipe for humidity and by season to help insure the perfect product, every time you go there. It's all of these small little touches that make this particular pizza joint stand out from all the rest.
There are so many things to say about this place. I love everything, from the very best french bread I've ever had that they serve with olive oil and vinegar, to their minimalist, ultra-classic spin on a salad, even to the great bar next door for the adults in your group while you wait. This restaurant truly is the pride of the Valley of the Sun. If you come to visit, you didn't really see Phoenix if you didn't go to Pizzeria Bianco. Period.",4,0,0

I was in downtown PHX for business which ended at 10:45, just in time for the pizzeria to open. Obviously, my dining partner and I didn't have to wait for a table. Service was excellent.

We ordered a couple of local beers from Prescott Brewery while perusing the menu. We started off with the Antipasto Wood Roasted Vegetables, Sopressata and Cheese Platter, the Margherita Pizza (tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, basil)  and the Wise Guy Pizza (wood roasted onions, smoked mozzarella, fennel sausage). All the food was fresh and perfectly baked.

We ordered the wise guy , which everyone was ordering , just check out the reviews and the Bianconverde. The latter doesn't come w tomato sauce , so we asked for extra tomato sauce with the ricotta , mozzarella , Parmesan & arugula pie. I  recommend trying this combo! it was amazing!! I can't eat a pizza without ricotta cheese now! The brick oven is in the middle of this tiny family style restaurant , so you can watch them make your pie.

Warning - Long Phoenix foodie history lesson starting.... NOW!

Here's the deal. Picture this: 2008, the Bush era was almost over, music got ridiculously good, fashion dictated perfection not seen since the 1950's, I had a beautiful boyfriend (crazy, and alcoholic as f***, but beautiful nonetheless), and the Foodie revolution in Phoenix was just about to take off. 

Pizzeria Bianco had already been there serving the best food made by human hands. This wasn't a result of a competitive restaurant environment, it was a creation resulting from the passion inside Chris Bianco. 

I would bring my beau to heritage square and put our names on the waiting list at 5 pm. 
 
We would wait in the blistering heat. We'd go to a movie, then we'd sneak into the trees to make out a bit. We'd play scrabble outside and meet other people waiting. 

At 8:45, if we were lucky, we got a table for two. Sometimes we waited until 10. 

The food.. (queue Italian reminiscent theme music)...

The memory of the soppressata appetizer is my fondest pre-vegan food memory. Meat is a disgrace, but if I was an animal I'd way rather end up as that soppressata than a McDonalds burger. 

The pizza.. I would always order two at the restaurant, then two to take home. I tried all six over several visits, but the Pizza Margherita was always the best. It had a perfection matched by no other pizza I had ever tasted - not from Rome, not from Sicily, not from New York, or Boston, or Chicago.

A perfectly soft yet crisp flat dough, slightly charred by the charcoal in the (coal?) oven, covered by tomato sauce that was at once fresh, yet matured with basil and salt.  house made mozzerella topped it, and it was perfection. Each Pizza was crafted by Chris Bianco himself. He would take a second to smile and nod at you between each Pizza. Every pizza was made by his hand. That was the magic.

Once, I caught Chris Bianco's eye from across the restaurant as I was leaving. I spoke to him in non verbal Italian, simply with my hands and my expression. ""Thank you deeply for the miracle you have created here. I am well nourished by it, what magnificent food!"" 

He responded back with a clasp of his chest, as if saying ""I am so grateful you can appreciate and share this!"" Then blew me a kiss. It was a masculine non-gay loving Italian heartfelt goodbye. 

So why 3 stars? That was 2008.. 

In 2010, Chris Bianco had to stop making the pizzas for his health:

http:\/\/www.azcentral.com\/thingstodo\/dining\/articles\/20100127chris-bianco-no-more-pizzas.html

He turned the cooking duties over to his assistant, but now, 3 years later, the magic has been lost. There was very little special about the Margherita Pizza I had in January when I went. It was a ghost of what it used to be. Almost unrecognizable. 

It's still good pizza, but dear readers, I am so sorry to say, it is not worth more than a 15 minute wait. 

Chris Bianco earned every accolade he got. I do not fault him. I know he would still be making every pie if he could. The tragedy is there is only 1 Chris Bianco.",5,0,1

If your planning to enjoy an evening hanging with some friends, this is a wonderful place to go and enjoy some pizza, wine and conversation. Our wait was just over an hour, which is very good considering most wait times are 2 hours + but that didn't matter since we were at the bar enjoying some good wine and catching up on life's frills and thrills.  Time flew by during our wait and we were eating in no time.  

We had their tomato, basil and homemade mozzarella salad for starters.  It was very good, fresh and the perfect balance of dressing. For dinner we had the Wise Guy and Sonny Boy pizza pies which were good but not the best I've tasted.  Their pizza crust is exceptional and the best feature of their pies in my opinion.

And yet...now I feel compelled to come back just to try this pizza....
Can it really be this good?!??!?!?!
Hmmmm....
Yah.
Maybe in the winter time.

Hold a place in line for me!!!!!!!!!!

We also go to the new one on camelback that serves pasta and sandwich dishes (both absolutely amazing, and made fresh in house.) We really like that they make their breads and noodles from scratch. The ingredients used are locally grown, which is awesome. They also feature Arizona ingredients and beverages on each menu.  

My favorite pizza is the bianco verde with prosciutto, and my husband gets the margherita pizza with sopressata, or even just plain! These are our go to's, but the wiseguy and rosa are amazing too! I adore the speidini... procuitto wrapped around fontina cheese on a bed of arugula, drizzled with olive oil! Mmmm, I want this all right now! Also, we typically get a bottle of wine, which seems to be the best way to go. They have a good selection of local and Italian wines at a reasonable price. 

Make sure you go before your starving though, because you are likely to wait at the original location. We have waited anywhere from 10 minutes to 2 hours. Luckily, Bar Bianco is right next door, so you can hop in for a cocktail... or three, and an appetizer while you wait. Both spots are quaint with timeless charm, so perfect for a date night or place to bring visitors. The pizza never disappoints! We will continue to come at least once a month!",0,0,0

Most of the people who eat here don't have reservations, which means waiting in line for hours, even after you get your name on the list, you have to wait longer. So most people go over to the bar next door and drink, if you think  about it, by the time you  get your pizza you have waited at least 3 or more hours, and more than likely are drunk. Combine that with the preconceived notions they have already heard about this place, it makes for one amazing pizza.

Now I'm not trying to hate on this place at all, but it is just so overrated. The pizza was really good, the customer service was horrible, price was okay. My friends and I had reservations and ended up not getting a table until 30 minutes after our reservations were supposed to start.

I have been here a few times before and was always amazed that Chris Bianco made every pizza himself. Knowing that he was not manning the oven any longer, I was interested in trying it again. 

I stopped by on Saturday night and put my name on the list at about 5:30. My girlfriend and I were seated at about 9:30. I ordered the Wise Guy and she ordered the margherita with prosciutto on half and sopressata on the other half. 

My Wise Guy was great with the fennel sausage and onions. Hers was great too with the spicy sopressata and melt in your mouth prosciutto.

When I moved to Phoenix 3 1\/2 years ago, Pizzeria Bianco was one of the first restaurants I was told I had to try. But I also heard about the ridiculous wait times, so that always prevented me from going. My dad was in town, and after seeing PB on Food Network, he wanted to try it, so that's where we went. 

First, I had no idea where PB was located, and I had a difficult time trying to find it. Unbeknownst to me, I drive by it literally every day, but the closed gate on Adams off of 7h street threw me for a loop. But alas, I finally found it! There is free valet parking right next to the restaurant, right before that closed gate. 

It was a Thursday evening around 5:45, and I was mentally prepared for a 2 hour wait; so I was pleasantly surprised when I found out the wait was only about 20 minutes! Nice! That made me very happy! 

We started off with the Caprese salad. The mozzarella and tomatoes were really fresh, and the salad was refreshing overall. We then ordered 2 pizzas, but we were able to try 4 different pizzas because we took advantage of the half and half ordering. Let's see, we had the Rosa, Wise Guy, Margherita and Biancoverde. The Wise Guy has big slices of grilled onions and pieces of fennel sausage. It was really good! The Margherita was probably my fave -- the ingredients were really fresh, and the sauce tasted like it was freshly made. The Rosa was my least favorite. Although it tasted good, the combination of red onions and pistachios was a little too pungent for me to enjoy more than one slice. 

NEWSFLASH: The chocolate icee (which has a much fancier name that I can't remember) is a MUST! Oh my....I'm not even a chocolate eater, but this icee was absolutely delish! It was so refreshing, and the perfect after pizza treat! 

My only gripe is that we felt like we were being rushed at the end, and not by our server, who was male. The moment we emptied a glass or cleared a plate, some chick would immediately come by to take it off the table. I understand that they're trying to move tables, but when we spend $16 each for medium size pizzas, we'll take our time getting up from the table. Nice try, though. 

All in all, the pizza was good, I can't take anything away from that. But for me, it didn't live up to the hype of being ""the best pizza in the country."" I've had similar quality pizza right here in Phoenix (i.e., try the prosciutto and artichoke pizza at Amano Bistro in South Mountain).",3,0,1

During summer months, outdoor seating is only for those who like to sit in saunas while having dinner.

We went next door to Bar Bianco and had a drink and some nibbles of goat cheese crostinis to pass the time, which really went pretty quickly.

The hour wait well worth it.  Anyone who says this place isn't worth the wait obviously doesn't know good pizza.  If you don't want the wait, and don't know good pizza when you eat it, please just go to Pizza Hut.  That will make MY wait here shorter.

We started with the organic baby greens salad, and then my husband and I had the Biancoverde, which comes with Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula.

My parents had the Margherita, with added mushrooms, onions, and olives.

We walked in and were greeted by the friendly servers and chefs. The inside is tiny (10 tables or so) but we were seated right away. 

We ordered a pizza and got half salami, half margherita. It took about 10-15 minutes but of course that's because it was being freshly baked in the giant wood-fired brick oven.  The pizza was really GOOD, it is exactly how I imagine it would be in Italy.  Super thin crust, slightly burned edges, sparse on the tomato sauce, and fresh ooey cheese and toppings. So yummy.

I don't think it's the best pizza in Arizona, let alone America.  It definitely wasn't worth the 2 1\/2 hour wait. And it absolutely was not worth the attitude from the bitchy hostess.

I didn't like the charred bread that covered my hands and face with soot and gave the pizza a bitter and burnt flavor. And the pizza with salami we ordered was limp and soggy.  Ignoring those things, the pizza was pretty good.  And I did ignore those things because I was starving.  Maybe that's why so many people love this place - being taunted with the idea of good pizza for hours kind of skews ones perception.",11,9,12

(Actually, if I'm being perfectly honest, I only happened by because I went to see the Star Trek Exhibit at the Arizona Science Center - *Snort!*)

I knew in advance about the insufferable wait, and it certainly appeared as described. Worse, even, than I had previously been made aware. For a sense of scale, let me simply say that I brought my Nintendo DS... and beat a game.. and started another one..

..and still had to wait another hour.

But, Jesus Tiberius CHRIST, was the food worth it! Mind you, I had been previously assured that the pizza was delicious, but I wasn't quite aware that it would be completely unlike anything I've stuffed down my gob prior. Fresh tomatoes, fresh dough, fresh cheese, fresh seasonings, Fresh Prince (psyche!) - that's this place's secret. The tomatoes tasted like tomatoes, not some canned, processed rubbish. I could make a meal of the crust, alone.

I'm not even a food snob about this sort of thing. I happily proclaim that Little Caesars' 5 1\/2 dollar pizzas are some of the yummiest pies around. But this pizza is truly Ninja Turtle-worthy. Worth both the wait and the above-average price. I want to buy the guy who made it a drink - non-alcoholic, mind you, because an adult beverage might prompt him to take a break.. and we simply cannot chance that.",3,2,2

The environment was so welcoming I didn't want to leave so I'll definitely return. Sometimes I like to consider myself a pizzaficionado and the pizza here was not disappointing one bit. I selected the Wiseguy for my first pie and boy ole boy was this love at first sight. I've never seen a pizza deck with onion filled with so much flavor. The sausage was so moist and blended well with the everything. The crust was so robust smoke seem to pour from my nose with each bite. Being a southerner and an avid griller I can appreciate the smoke taste within a dish.

Make sure to order enough to take home... between my boyfriend and I, we ordered 3 pizzas:
The Rosa (it has pistachios on it. and that may freak you out, but take a chance --- it's the best pizza I've ever had).

I won't be so naive as to complain about the wait, we went knowing it would be a long wait, and arriving at 4:45, we were told it would be 3.5 to 4 hours. No big surprise there. Luckily we were actually sat at 7:45, so that was nice. 

The market salad was great, a super light vinaigrette, super fresh escarole greens and nicely shaved parmigiano reggiano. The Antipasto was amazing as well, with roasted vegetables and olives and sopressata. So far I was very pleased with my meal.

Then came the pizza. We ordered the Wiseguy, and added mushrooms and garlic.

Now I've had thin crust pizza cooked in a wood fired oven before, but I have NEVER had it be not only undercooked in the center but completely sopping wet. We're talking grab the crust and pull a slice to your place and only get 2 inches of actual pizza, with the rest of the mush still in the center of the plate. Ok, so its a little undercooked, big deal right?

Wrong. So wrong. The sausage must have been sitting next to the anchovies (which I like) because the sausage slices on half of the pizza tasted like  bait chum smells. If you've ever been to a harbor, and smelled that rotting fish carcass smell, imagine how that would taste and you'll understand. 

My wife apparently lucked out and didn't get any pieces with that taste because she said it was fine. I was not so lucky. When she had a leftover slice the next day though she got a taste of that and literally lost her lunch.

I'm a VERY forgiving type with restaurants, but I am not ok with waiting 3 hours to feast on undercooked rotted fish tasting pizza. I've never been angry about a dining experience before now, but that's the only way I can describe this debacle.

I may give it another chance, but only after I've simmered for a while.",14,8,8

We asked for olives on the side, since my husband doesn't like olives.  And even the olives were delicious!  And not super salty like most olives. 
 You can tell they use high quality ingredients.  The wiseguy was a little too much onion for me, and I liked the tomato base of the Sonny Boy better than the white pie.  I don't think this is a destination spot, but if you're in the area, it's definitely worth trying!  Having to valet seemed a little ridiculous - we came for lunch and the lot was empty.

I will start from the end.

I'm later walking my dog after an incredible meal and think to myself ""where else in the valley does the experience begin with a wait?"" And I am not talking the walk up, get a buzzer, and wait. No sir, I'm talking people lining up before the doors open. Chris Bianco must love to come to work every day with a line out the door. Because the day there is no line and no wait? That will be a sad day.

I'm in marketing, so naturally I think the setup is brilliant. A small, cozy place, the owner cooking who actually acknowledges you when you walk in and the feeling of honor to be a part of the ""Bianco Secret Society"" when you finally do get in. I stood in line for just over an hour - just enough time to chat with a few people in front of me and behind me. And although I didn't make the first seating because my party was too large (8) - when I finally did get in, it was very cool to see the people I stood with in line give me a nod and smile and say ""Hey! You made it!""

THE FOOD: 
I swear in the back of Pizzeria Bianco is some secret garden where all of the fresh ingredients come from because the quality is there. You can't find veggies with that kind of flavor anywhere. The sausages are definitely imported from Italy (I know I've been there) - so many people might not like the flavor because it's not Americanized. It's all real here folks. 

I studied for my venture here on yelp. Every review helped me but here is my own experience and hopefully it will help others. My grandma wanted to try this place for her birthday, so with 4 seniors and 4 others totaling 8 - I thought we would need reservations. I called for a few weeks but never seemed to get through when I called and they seemed booked for months in advance. So after reading yelp, I found out that even if you do make reservations you still wait. So unarmed with reservations, I agreed to go into battle alone and stand in line. It was a Friday, and with 7 hungry people on their way to meet me at 5, I was a bit nervous about being able to get in at all. I left work early, hopped on the light rail and stood in line at about 3:50 and was the 25th or so in line. I brought a book, but chatted most of the time anyhow - there were plenty of trees and benches and so it was very relaxing. When the doors opened at 5, they did the first seating but then everybody else in line waited to be put on the list. We were quoted 7:30. So we walked next door and grabbed wine and beer and relaxed. It wasn't 6:30 and they called us in - and there we were! IN!

I ordered one of each of the pizzas on the menu. Everybody thought it would be too much food, but there was NOTHING LEFT. The pizza is not the heavy, cheesy, pizza we're used to normally - you can eat quite a bit. We started with a few salads and the antipasto. LOVED the antipasto. Salads were definitely fresh grown greens, the flavor was amazing.

I could go on with much more detail, but I'll end this by saying we each had our favorite, mine was the one with Arugula on top. We all walked away talking about how amazing it was and how great we felt, after dining on pizza. That's a sign of quality ingredients.

All of that said, I can appreciate many places for what they offer to their customers. I will definitely be back to Pizzeria Bianco, but can also say a good greasy slice of Slices also does the trick at times. The dining experience is all what you make of it.",4,2,3

BE PREPARED TO WAIT! Alright, most people seem to know this going in (we did too). However, when you arrive at 7:00pm, and they say you won't be seated until 11:30pm, that doesn't mean you can put your name in and show up at 11...which we almost found out the hard way: **At 10:00pm they will do one last head count. If you're not in the vicinity, soooorrrrry!** Luckily we were calling in every hour for updates (which they recommend, btw). At 9:40pm we called and got the news that we better be there for the last head count (information we probably could have used earlier), and had to hurry on back from our meanderings downtown. At 10:00pm we were deemed worthy to stay on the list and wait another 45 minutes or so.

Service: the hostess knows she holds all the cards--sort of like the lady at the cash register for the Soup Nazi. However, a smile was all it took to get one back from her for me. Still, I can see how others might misconstrue her attitude as something less than cordial. Our server was great though! Very helpful and fun. He was as excited to serve us as we were to eat there. Good stuff!

The pizza is indeed great! But after waiting 4 hours, I was expecting the heavens to part and birds to sing and the ground to shake. Nope. Just made-from-scratch, meticulously-thought-out, high-quality pizza. A light and airy, smoky crust, a decent sauce and fresh mozzarella formed the basis of the Sonny Boy and Wise Guy pizzas that we tried. The quality and tastiness of the toppings were also apparent. We were impressed. This was absolutely great pizza--one of the best we've ever had. ...I just don't know if I'll hurry back to Pizzeria Bianco to wait that long again.",6,1,3

Do not be discouraged by the hour's long lines because it is worth it. You have two options to make this more bearable. Show up before 5:30 and skip the line or make your reservation and get a drink at the bar next door. Just let Bianca know you'll be there and they'll come get you when you're up.

Everything here is cooked in the oven and this makes a huge difference in taste. Everything comes out crispy and flavorful it's too bad new wood fire ovens are outlawed.

It's special because he is simply, and utterly....happy.

Ladies and Gentleman of Yelp....I have found the pizza that makes me happy.

I heard all the hype...""best pizza in the country"", ""Oprah says it's the best"", ""The Food Network hypes it up"", ""Chris Bianco learned how to make pizza from Jesus"". Ok, I made up the last one.

My friend and pizza aficionado, Lance has been known to drive in from Los Angeles...just for this pizza, and then he would drive home. Sometimes, he'd even fly in. It had to be good, right? 

Tonight, I chose Pizzeria Bianco for my birthday dinner because of the hype. I had made a pathetic attempt to dine here once, but myself and the individual I was with, we both were intimidated by the 3 hour wait. 

Is any pizza worth three hours? That's a personal judgment call. That night, I ended up dining at Nobuo, across the path....and it was a nice meal.

I digress. I've been preparing for this trip. I read up on various press articles, and discovered that as of last week, they are open for lunch AND Mondays! Perfect. 

Tonight, I dined with my parents. My favorite dining companions. 

We sat down in the very intimate dining space. No wait at all. Perhaps, people don't know that they are open on Mondays. Fine by me.

The decor is nice. Simple, with a classic cucina feel. The brick oven is the star of this place. Clearly.

We ordered some bread to get started. It came with a little cup of high end olive oil. Fantastic! The crust was crisp, and the bread was chewy to the point where you can't help but smile when you eat this.

The pizza is phenomenal. We ordered two pizzas (for three people). One was half Rosa and half Margherita, the other was the Biancoverde.  This way we were able to try three different kinds of pizza .
All three styles were phenomenal. The winner of the three was the Margherita. The tomato sauce doesn't overpower, the mozzarella melts like a dream, and a hint of basil. 

The Rosa was unique, and also delicious. The Arizona pistachios take some getting used to, but pairs well with the red onion. 

The Biancoverde was much more complex. Definitely a hearty pizza because of the ricotta cheese. Very tasty. It's topped with arugala, so you will get a nice earthy, and loud flavor. 

Usually when I eat pizza, I take a bite of the crust, and then I leave the rest. Not here. I went through the entire pizza slice because it's perfect. Chewy, crispy, and full of happy!

Take it from me....this place is worth the hype. Look at the reviews from other Yelpers. Even the picky ones love this place.

Maybe it's true. Maybe Chris Bianco did learn how to make pizza from Jesus. Sure as hell tastes like it.

Now if you are wondering about the other stuff, it was also a five star experience: staff friendly and attentive, and the bathrooms are spotless.

Worth the 3 hour wait? YES. Bring all your friends here? YES. Will I guarantee the awesome? YES.

We ordered a pizza with sausage but the sausage was sliced very thick and was four times thicker than the crust so it was very difficult to eat. The proportion didn't work for me and the flavors weren't anything great that I couldn't get from Sauce (fast-food, upscale pizza).",1,0,0

Many times Paul and I have come here and just ordered a bottle or two of wine and sat outside on the long picnic table near the lights.  Other times we made a reservation and walked around downtown Phoenix or checked out the Science Museum and came back to eat.  Either way this place is worth the wait!

No. And for the same price I've had better. Because of great reviews and I've seen it once featured in ""The best thing I ever ate"" on FoodNetwork, we decided to make a final stop with excitement before heading back to LA.

We ordered the Margherita and Wiseguy. The tomato sauce on the Margherita appeared little and dry, and the wiseguy was pretty much just piled with a ton of mozzarella cheese with few pieces of fennel sausages and onions here and there. I've had many gourmet pizzas, and fine, I understand a chef's passion when it comes to food and however it's made is supposedly the best for the customers. But WHAT IF, I'm saying ""WHAT IF"" whoever was making the pizza that day happened to put so little tomato sauce, which caused the pizza to be so dry and not enjoyable? Instead of sending back the entire pizza and having them remake one, we asked for a side tomato sauce and boy, we were rejected and given a speech of whatever the owner\/chef said, blah blah blah. Never once asked us how the pizza was before turning down our request.

Wait...  what is this?  PB is open for lunch? On Saturdays?  Without a wait!?  OK, I take that all back.  Let's go!

On a recent Saturday we made our way to Heritage Square.  I approached the little restaurant\/house building with a hefty dose of skepticism.  Could it really be *that* good?

The space is not very large, and was nearly full at 11:30.  Grabbing two open seats at the bar (with a great view of the wood-fired oven), we decided to try two pizzas:

Sonny Boy ($16) - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Sopressata (salami), Gaeta Olives.  As I am not a fan of olives, I asked for this to be served without them.  It was really just OK.  The crust was slightly overcooked making the edges more burnt than charred.  Also, it was sliced haphazardly, making the slices strange sizes and shapes.

I was not very impressed.  Until the second pizza arrived:

Biancoverde ($16) - Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula.
This was a very interesting and tasty pizza!  A perfect blend of cheeses and garlic.  The Arugula was a nice contrast to the perfect blend of cheeses and garlic.  And, unlike the Sonny Boy, this crust was delicious!

About a week later, I had the opportunity to enjoy a couple of other PB varieties (in addition to the Biancoverde) during lunch with a few (skeptical) co-workers:

Rosa ($13) - Red Onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, AZ Pistachios.  This sounds like a strange combination, but it works!

Wiseguy ($16) - Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage.  Good, but did not take the place of the Biancoverde as my favorite.

It was fun to watch their nervous expressions at the sight of an arugula-covered pizza turn to smiles of delight at their first bites.

So, I am glad I finally gave PB a try.  Will I ever wait hours and hours for these pizzas?  No!  However, you may find me there at lunchtime, savoring a Biancoverde with a smile.",12,9,12

The pizza was most definitely not amazing, stupendous, or even particularly impressive.  It wasn't horrible, it wasn't inedible, but it wasn't worth the hype and it was not worth the wait.

I would give it 3 or maybe 3 1\/2 stars, but it gets worse thanks to the atmosphere.

He made it quite clear that I had one chance to order and I would not be able to make any changes or additions once he put the order in.  Between that and the hectic din and the general sense that this place was all that and a slice of pizza, I was sort of let down.

As someone else here pointed out, though, the bar next door was actually quite nice.  Pleasant atmosphere and definitely more relaxed.  We chatted with the bartender for a time before we realized that we needed to get in line to get our name on The List so we could come back to the bar.  Hmmm.

As one of Phoenix's popular restaurants, I had to check out Pizzeria Bianco and see what the fuss was all about!

Known for their thin crust pizza and long hour waiting period to dine here (minus a star), I came one Friday evening with the parentals. Parking was very limited. You either valet or head across the street by an underground garage parking (which can be validated 1 hour off from Pizzeria Bianco). We ended up paying $7 after validation from our 3 hour stay within the vicinity.

As I walked in, the hostess greeted me and took my name and party #. She mentioned the wait would probably be about 1 hour and 30-45 minutes. After expecting a 2 hour wait time, she recommended to head next door in their waiting lobby which also has a bar and offers small snacks. We had a bottle of wine and insalata dish.

After waiting for a little over an hour, we were summoned by our waitress at their waiting lobby area. We were able to transfer our food and drinks next door. 

The venue is very cozy, dim lit and rustic. About 35-40% of the room is taken up by their kitchen\/bar, while the rest of the area is full of tables for diners. Since it's a small area, it can also be quite loud and difficult to hear a conversation.

We were kindly greeted by our waiter, who was able to answer all of our questions and recommended items on the menu that was quite popular amongst the diners and himself. For service, we were well taken care of! (**4 STARS**)

OVERALL THOUGHTS
I think Pizzeria Bianco is a decent place for some thin crust pizza, but it was NOT worth waiting that long. You pretty much waited 2 hours, but once seated, your pizza comes in like 5 minutes. The pizza wasn't bad at all, nor was the best I've ever had. Consider it satisfying if you were to dine here, but was not memorable. I do love the fact that it is home made and the products used to generate their pizza pies are of substantial quality and of local products, but I have had better pizza in Portland and San Diego who play the same game.

Is it worth visiting if you're in the area? Yes, if you want to say you've been here.
Is it the best pizza you'll have? No

I hope that helps you out if you choose to dine here.

What I loved about this place was how fresh the ingredients were- the mozzarella is house-made every morning, and they were growing herbs outside in the front garden.  This reminded me of my favorite pizzeria (in NY), where they have their own herb garden- this is a must to get the freshest ingredients (which is why I laugh hysterically when I see a Pappa Johns commercial touting fresh ingredients- as if!).

I am a devoted brick oven fan- there is no pizza that comes close for me.  The crust is very thin and crispy here, just as it should be.  I would not even try to compare other styles like deep dish.

Other things worth noting: I had a slice of the onion pizza, and I didn't like it as much- it had no sauce, rendering it a little dry for my taste.  Also, we dined mi-afternoon to avoid crowds, and I wasn't able to order the anti-pasto, which was very sad (it's only available after 5pm).  I would have loved to have tasted some of that fresh mozzarella straight up.  Our waiter wasn't the best, but I don't really care that much, because I'm in heaven with delicious brick oven pizza.

The pizzeria is not very large - maybe large enough for 30 at any one time.  Behind the counter is a large brick oven.  I ordered the pizza to go and waited for about 15 minutes before it was presented to me.  I drove back to my hotel in rush hour traffic and approximately 25 minutes had elapsed by the time I chowed down on the pizza.  Even though it was not piping hot it was still great. The crust is amazing - very light, chewy and a great char.  My pizza was a margherita and I added the wood roasted mushrooms and sopressata.  The sopressata was the reason for losing a star.  Perhaps its an acquired tastte but I would have preferred regular pepperoni as the sopressata was a little ""gamey"" for my taste.  But again, the fresh mozzarella, sauce and especially the crust were one of a kind and I would definitely return.  Its an artisanal pie and has to be judged as such.  I would have to say DeLorenzos in Trenton was a better pie and Bleeker St Pizza in NY was a better taste experience.  This is a stand alone experience and I would urge everyone who loves pizza to check it out.",1,0,0

Every city has one of these places--a restaurant for which people will wait hours. Standing, waiting, anticipating alleged manna from Heaven. Atlanta has a few of these. One is Nuevo Laredo Cantina. Another is Taqueria del Sol, whose line is culinary equivalent of trying to buy U2 concert tickets were they set to perform in an actual U2.  I hate going to these places. Oh, the food is fine, but I can't stand waiting in line for food. By the end of it, you don't know if the food was actually worth the wait or if your drool was simply some sort of Pavlovian response to being deprived of nutrition for hours on end.

And so it was that I originally wasn't going to come here. Unfortunately (or, as it turns out, fortunately) my manhood was questioned by another Yelper and I made the trek from my hotel room in Chandler to Pizzeria Bianco. That was Tuesday night. The wait for a single person, I was told, was 2.5 hours. I thanked them and continued on my way.

That would've been the end of it for most places, but the smell in there was incredible. Burning wood, cooking meats, herbs mixing with liquid fat--I pledged to come back and do better.

A few days later, I tried again.  Following protocol, I showed up at 4pm. Pizzeria Bianco opens at 5. I grabbed a beer next door, took a seat, and watched the growing crowd around me. A lady asked, ""Is there, um, an actual line?""

A (from what I gathered) regular answered. ""Nope. It's on the honor system."" And most honorably, the lady and her husband took their place behind the rest of us. I sat at the bar and ordered a caprese salad, a beer and a wise guy. It took a little bit to get my food, but it was nothing compared to the first wait. I chatted with a peculiar man who, when he told me he collected rocks and minerals, it didn't surprise me in the least.

My pizza arrived and I inhaled deeply. I snapped my obligatory picture and took a bite. Nice. Strangely enough, though the crust was crunchy in the right places and the fennel gave the sausage a great kick, it was the onions that did it. A smokiness had been imparted to the onions that came through in every bite. I should be embarrassed to say that I ate the whole thing, but I'm not. Suck it, Gluttony.

It wasn't until 24 hours later, though, that the full impact was felt. At that point, I was going to give a solid four stars, but dinner that next night changed that. Here I was in Atlanta's famed Rathbun's (whose executive chef\/owner had actually beaten Bobby Flay at Iron Chef) and was nibbling on a very nice, much appreciated meal. But my mind kept wandering back to those smoky onions from the night before. 

""I miss those onions. I wonder what they're doing right now? I wonder if they think about me from time to time? Oh, that sounds so desperate. But maybe if I logged into Facebook, I could read onions' status. No, that's ridiculous. I'm sure those onions have moved on by now.  Onions, if you ever get the chance, call me!""

I was eating food, created by a legit Iron Chef, and I was distracted by a pizza consumed hours earlier. If that doesn't deserve five stars, I don't know what does.",15,19,17

There is no way some pizza place in Phoenix can compete with Chicago & New York or could it?  That was the question I was out to answer on Tuesday night at 9:15 PM as I put my name down at Pizzeria Bianco.  After a 15 minute wait I was seated and ready to try ""The Best Pizza in the Country.""

Being the consummate fat ass, I ordered the Spiedini, a Caprese, the Sonny Boy, and bottle of Deschutes Mirror Pond Pale Ale all for lil ole me! The Spiedini was a string cheese like piece of Fontina wrapped in Prosciutto and served warm atop a bed of baby arugula.  You can't beat cheese wrapped in prosciutto can you?  I can't.  The Handmade Mozzarella, Local Tomato and Basil with EVOO salad was brilliant. The mozzarella was soft and had a beautiful saltiness to it.  I could have eaten 2 pounds of the cheese alone.  Making the dish really sing was the super ripe and delicious tomatoes.  If I had to manufacture a gripe about this dish it would be that they may have been a little heavy handed with the EVOO.  

Here comes my pizza! The Sonny Boy is topped with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, salami, and gaeta olives.  Man was this a good pie.  The crust is crusty, flaky, a bit blackened, and thin while still being a tad chewy.  The tomato sauce was so plain and simple that it made me question why anybody would go and ruin perfectly good tomato sauce by over seasoning it.  The salami and olives paired perfectly and worked in concert to deliver a world class pie.

The interior is almost too perfect.  I kept looking around to see if I was on a Hollywood soundstage that was built to resemble a quaint pizzeria in Naples.  Bianco is almost too perfect!  He's pounding out pizzas behind his counter with sweat and flour both clinging to his brow.  He too looks like Hollywood's image of the perfect pie guy. When something seems too good to be true it typically is, but Bianco lives up to the hype. 

Is it the best pizza in the country?  No. Is it an amazing pizza that's worth waiting for? Yes.

I was prepared for the wait and arrived a good two hours before I planned on partaking in the feast that I had heard so much about.  I have got to admit, I LOVE the atmosphere and love the beer\/wine bar next door as well as the English place across the street.  Its all part of it....and the charm is unlike much of anything that I am accustom to in the Southwest.  I almost felt like I was in New England or even the Carolina's.  It has a wonderful old world charm.

OK.  So its finally time and we get seated at a wonderful and cozy table by an absolutely charming hostess.  Really made me feel special.  We perused the menu and ordered three  that seemed would be a perfect complement to one another and 15 minutes later they arrived.

Ehhh.  So, so.  Fair.  One of them said on the menu that it came with a marinara based sauce had no sauce whatsoever.  At least nothing recognizable.  When we asked if there was any way at all that we could get some sauce on the side (and we knew that Bianco doesnt roll with that) we were politely told that they do not do that BUT they would make us another one if we wished.  I mean that is a wonderful offer...but we couldnt bare to see a decent pizza get wasted.  It just needed a little sauce!  So we told them ""no thanks...it's fine"".

Ingredients are fresh, service great and atmosphere really kinda special but once again, the pizza isnt that out of this world.  But I guess you've got to do it because it is after all ""Pizzeria Bianco"".  And I will be back.  Probably quite a few times.  I loved the experience.  But for a woodfired pizza...with quality without the ego (to not allow a side of sauce to come out) there are a few places I'd pick first.

So long and short (I have to believe) is that you should communicate with the waitstaff as to what you enjoy in a pizza without presuming that it comes with things we take for granted like a good red sauce.  I have a hunch that if you do you are probably guaranteed to enjoy your za when it shows up.

Our waiter brought the pizza before the salad arrived, and when he realized we hadn't received our salad yet he said he would go back to get our salad and THEN bring out the pizza, which is fine - no big deal, timing mishaps happen. But when the pizza came it was soggy and pretty bland. The crust on the edges, which wasn't soggy, had great flavor, but that's about it. Too bad.

Also make sure to tell them EXACTLY how you like your pizza cooked, light, medium or well.  Either way you'll always a light chewy & flavorful crust,  really excellent to wash down with a cold draft or glass of wine .

Typical to everyone else's story, I arrived at 4:30 knowing I would have a wait. The rest of my party arrived a little later after I put my name on the list. There were about 60 people in line in front of me. For a table (they also have counter seating) the wait was going to be 2 to 2.5 hours. Our group went across the way to one of my favorite places Nobuo at Teeter House and had some drinks and some ""appetizers.""

About 2 hours later we headed back to Pizzeria Bianco and found out our name had already been called. The hostess was very nice and got us in to table within 10 minutes.

The place is definitely small and cozy. We ordered an Antipasto and also the mozzarella and Tomato. Both were very good. I ordered a Sonny Boy (Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, Gaeta Olives). The pizza is very thin and light and is very fresh tasting. Our table also ordered a Marinara Pizza, Rosa Pizza, and a Wiseguy. The Rosa was very interesting since it had pistachios on it and the Wiseguy was good, but it could use some sauce. Overall, like I said before, good pizza, but definitely not the best in the country.

They don't take reservations (anymore) and they don't do takeout (although I did order a pizza to go) and with there always being a huge wait, I think he's got a good business going where you eat and drink while waiting at his other place next store (Bar Bianco).

Happened by it one time when there was no line, came in and sat down, and had my pizza ten minutes later.

I probably should give it 4 stars.  But after hearing about it being the best pizza in the world almost, expectations were high.

On one side of the aisle, you have the idiot trendoids who love bragging about how long they'll wait in line for restaurants, and how they were eating there before anybody else. They'll gladly report, ""THIS IS THE BEST PIZZA EVER, WELL WORTH THE 3 HOUR WAIT!!!!"" They also don't mind overpaying to be underfed.
These people are easily recognized by their ability to spend $300 on an outfit that makes them look homeless and by their incessant need to always be sporting at least one Apple product.

The other camp is the folks who hate this place on a near personal level. They act as insulted by the food or wait time as they would be by a Nazi-sympathizer or a spit in the face. These are people who hate most everything that has proven to be popular with other people, and they hate Pizzeria Bianco, even though there's nothing hatable here.

Both groups are generously represented here. Both groups are full of shit. HERE'S THE TRUTH.

Best Pizza Ever? Hell no. You'd have to be functionally retarded to call this the ""BEST"" pizza you've ever eaten. In a lot of books, what is being served here wouldn't even qualify as pizza. An overly simple menu offers only 6 pie choices, 3 of which offer no tomato sauce and 2 offering no cheese. Pizzeria Bianco is really more of a Lavash than a pizza in that the crust is more of a toasted cracker than a pizza crust. This will lead to a soggy mess only minutes after your pie comes out of the oven. Is there any way, honestly, you can call something a pizza when your ingredient menu EXCLUDES PEPPERONI, MEATBALLS (ground beef of any kind), & GREEN PEPPERS. That's right, none of these exists on the premises. BEST PIZZA EVER?!? C'mon Corky, Life Goes On Without Pizzeria Bianco.

Worst Pizza Ever? Seriously? You never had a Totino's or a Lil Caesar's $5 crap pie? I truly believe the people who hate Pizzeria Bianco are really just hating on the people stupid enough to proclaim undying love for this place. This pizza(?) is not offensive in the least, even if it isn't really pizza. We actually liked the flavor of our WISE GUY. Again, we questioned whether of not it should even be classified as a pizza, but it was none-the-less tasty. Had I waited 2-3 hours, would I have been pissed off? Yep. Not to the point where I'm pissed off for life at everybody involved with the joint, like they shot my dog. Then again I'm not stupid enough to wait 2-3 hours at a place like this.

There's the rub with Pizzeria Bianco....the people who are claiming it to be the ""best ever"" and ""well worth the hours wait"" are absolute idiots, full of shit to the point of turning their eyes brown. Those who hate Pizzeria Bianco and it's fans like they contribute to Al Qaeda, have no real basis for their hatred and are way too over-reactive.

So judge for yourself.

Go down on a Saturday between 11am & noon to avoid the notorious wait times, drink a cold one and have lunch. You'll discover what we did; Pizzeria Bianco is simply a charming little place with nice people serving what may or may not be pizza. But that ain't so bad.",11,11,2

While waiting for our table, we were directed towards the cabin next door that also had a bar. Very cute, rustic feel. Indoor and outdoor seating available.

Drinks: Hot Mexican Chocolate and Warm Cider 
The hot chocolate wasn't too sweet or chocolaty, in fact it was a little bitter. The cider was refreshing with a subtle hint of orange and ginger.
 
I was with an individual that had a nut allergy, and one of their pizza's was topped with crushed pistachios. We asked if they could make it without pistachios and we were told no. Ultimately, resorting us to two options on the menu.

Pizza: Margherita and Biancoverde
Nothing special about the traditional pizza. The biancoverde was better than what I was expecting. It's a no sauce, and had a delightful blend of cheeses.

We flew in from San Diego on Fri afternoon, immediately went to Pizzeria Bianco at 330pm and was the 3rd group in line. Weather was about 110 degrees, so we acknowledged each other by eye contact, but limited talking or movements. The staff at the bar (opens at 4) was very friendly, provided water and drinks. By the time 5 rolled around, the line was past the bar area. Summary of eats:
-Antipasto which consisted of wood roasted vegetables (red peppers, mushrooms, fennel, cauliflower, and beets), cheese and Sopressata.
-Rosa Pizza (Red Onion, Parmigiana Reggiano, Rosemary, Pistachios)
-WiseGuy Pizza (Carmelized Onion, Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage)

Conclusion: The antipasto was a pleasant surprise, with the mushroom and fennel being the highlight. We were not a fan of the pizzas. The Rosa pizza was too strong in parmigiana and overpowered the entire pizza. Unless you're a avid fan of parmigiana, I wouldn't order again. The WiseGuy pizza was ok, nothing extraordinary. The fennel sausage had good balance flavor. The pizza dough was good balance and nice char. 

Considering the efforts and reputation, we were definitely expecting alot more. Many warned me that the pizza would not live to the expectation and sadly they are correct.

Don't come here on a budget, order away, and leave satisfied. 
Don't expect to walk right in, unless you plan ahead (get there at 4pm), *and* come on an off night. 
Life isn't fair, so pay attention to who is arriving before and after you as you arrive (if early) as we have been placed on the honor system, otherwise you may not make the first wave. 
So, on to the grub. They have (uber-cold) 4peaks Sunbru on draft. This beer HAS to be super cold for me to like it, and it was that, and it pairs great with pasta\/pizza. We started off with the Antipasto, and yeah, we ate it all. The veggies cooked in wood gave it a nice flavor. Not necessarily the best antipasto ever, but different, and an excellent appetizer. We ordered a Sonny Boy (Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, Gaeta Olives) and a Wiseguy (Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage). The Wiseguy is a white pizza, which I am usually not too fond of, but the fennel sausage and ultra thin crust it was excellent. The real winner in this meal was the Sonny Boy. Literally covered in thin, crisping salami and mozzarella cheese that actually had flavor, this was hands down the best pizza I have ever had the pleasure of eating. 
I will come here again, early, hopefully often.",3,2,3

Bianco's is OVERRATED!

There, I said it. I'm sure I lost some readers along the way but I can handle that.

The most unfortunate thing about this whole Bianco love affair is that the concept, building, and product are all excellent. The pizza is very good. The building is an amazing old brick structure that reminds me of my loft. The area is as beautiful as you will find in downtown Phoenix, surrounded by lush greenery, a garden, and tons of history. Waiting isn't even that bad when you consider Bar Bianco is full of the same character and spirit that the pizzeria is. I hate to hate Pizzeria Bianco...but I do.

We went a couple years back. We were going to a Dbacks game of particular importance (Dirty Byrnes t-shirt night) and decided we'd put our names in at Bianco's. The wait is usually 2 hours so that gave us plenty of time to watch most of the game. Around the 5th we decided it had been enough time so we headed over. The hostess told us it would be another hour or so.

Hmph....

Of course we had no idea that the Oprah Show was doing a special on the restaurant this night so Gail is running around inside making a hell of a backup for the kitchen. Just our luck.

Almost two more hours later we were finally seated. Gail left a few minutes after that. We ordered the Biancoverde pizza (which was not green) and well, it tasted like every other wood-fired pizza I have ever had. The crust was charred on the bottom but the pizza was perfect. I'm not sure if brick ovens are outlawed in downtown, but I don't get the trend. In any event, as we were about to finish, Chris Bianco came over and apologized for making us wait so long, he paid for our dinner and bought us dessert. Awful nice for a guy who knows that every housewife within 3000 miles is going to be flying to Phoenix to wait four hours for his pizza.

Like I said, I didn't hate it. But it wasn't worth 4 hours. It wasn't worth the original 2 but I had to see what the hype was about. I wouldn't wait longer than 40 minutes for Bianco's because, that is the longest you will ever wait at Cibo. You will have a similar experience for a similar price but you won't be starved when you finally sit down to eat.",2,2,3

However, one thing that rings true when you go to Pizzeria Bianco is this quote from Joe Beddia ""He said that, sure, he could teach me a few things, but it was up to me to find my own style"". Despite neopalitan pizza places popping up left and right it is those pizza places that have their own character and don't just follow the VPN standards letter by letter that can really shine. Quickly on non pizza food: I could make a meal out of the bread they serve when you walk in. I had a salad as an appetizer and it was simple and well dressed. 

On to the pizza: this is artisan pizza at its best. It is made in a wood fired oven quickly as you would expect from a artisinal pizza place. However, the crust is a little sturdier than Neapolitan pizzas. It is able to hold ingredients well but at the same time if you are big into folding you could do that too. You can easily tell that Bianco takes great pride in his local ingredients and it shows in the taste. The meats were delicious and the cheese was exactly what you are looking for on this kind of pizza.

If you love pizza you have to come to Bianco!",0,0,0

This place is super small and crowded, but we were happy to be able to see the original heritage square location, with the wood-fire ovens and authentic dishes. We'll be trying the Camelback location soon.

Food: We got one of the salads to start with, which was very good, but not the star of the show. This was followed by the Wiseguy (roasted onion, house mozzarella, and fennel sausage) and Biancoverde (house mozzarella, parmigiano reggiano, and ricotta, topped with arugula) pizzas. My husband preferred the Wiseguy, while I liked the Biancoverde better, but we agreed that both pizzas were phenomenal. Next time, we'll try a red sauce pizza. What surprised us was that the dessert, a rich, dark flourless chocolate cake with a super decadent vanilla bean creme, was just as good as the pizzas. I still crave it! 

Service: Very friendly - everyone was happy to answer our questions. Drink refills were a little bit slow, considering that we were there in an off time of day, but nothing to get upset over. Prepare to spend some time here waiting for them to craft the perfect food - the wait is worth it!",0,0,0

The wait was about half an hour for us. The dim lit red brick interior started with a patio dining area and small cozy interior with an open kitchen, brick oven, and display of their signature bread. They specialize in a small number of artisanal pizzas with a high mark up. The noise level was high, as we were seated on the counter overlooking a number of pizzas delivered to the tables. 

The Margherita ($15) came with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil. Their pizza crust was excellent: thin, crisp, carried great flavor and a crunch in every bite. Their tomato sauce and mozzarella were equally excellent, but more basil could have helped to boost the flavor. I also suggest interested diners who wish for a savory anchor to order it with prosciutto. 

The Wisebuy ($18) was made with wood-roasted onion, house smoked mozzarella, and fennel sausage. The mozzarella had a nice hint of smoke coupled with savory sausage. The onions gave sweet rise to the flavors, and the thin crust was again, memorable. I would love to have the option of ordering the Margherita to come with smoked mozzarella.

They require valet parking which was an inconvenience when there was no street parking available in the area. The price of these individualized pizzas was also higher than expected, which unfortunately, influenced my rating when compared to other better pizzas in the Valley. Service was attentive and efficient. I would be interested in coming back to try their Sonny Boy and Biancoverde.",12,8,11

I've tried Mozza in LA and Waldy's NY, and I was kinda bummed that I would be eating it again in Phoenix of all places.  And waiting 2+ hours at that.  I kept pushing our group to settle for Grimaldi's.  I was wrong.  Bianco's blew me away!  Holy shite.

I wasn't even hungry. I was all cheesed out from my previous meals. I even had 3 glasses of wine which usually curbs my appetite. I had bread.  I even sampled all our sides(roasted garlic, prosciutto, and the caprese salad). 

But when those pizzas came out, I couldn't stop myself from hoovering 4 slices, crust and all.  Okay...it doesn't sound like much but mind you, it was 10:30pm, and my 4th meal of the day.  

My favorite was the Rosa. It was heavy, cheesy, and nutty. That's right a pizza with pistachios...who knew? It was perfect. The Biancoverde was my second fave...the aragula compliments and lightens the cheese factor.  Margherita was good but too safe for me.  The Rosa I couldn't get enough of.  I had two slices there, and I had another slice as soon as I woke up the next day.  A cold slice of pizza.  And I don't do cold pizza EVER.

Since I was with my carnivore boyfriend, nothing on the menu sounded good to him except the WISEGUY, which is made with caramelized onions and fennel sausage. I do wish I had tried a different pizza but I compromised since I eat everything.

The pizza with fresh mozzarella really lacked favor. The sauce is good, I also very much enjoyed the crust, but sausage wasn't good (fennel overload) and there was no other flavor to this pizza. We also tried Sonny which was better thanks to the saltiness of the salami which the fresh moz completely lacks, but still nothing special. Unfortunately, I think $18 was too expensive for a average if not below average pizza. 

I will however say that they have EXCELLENT customer service.",3,1,1

I always start with a delicious glass of red wine, duh. But the food, THE FOOD. I start with their simple organic greens salad and olives for the table. Their olives are to die for, I LOVE the bright green ones, in fact, sometimes I ask for ONLY the bright green kind! Their Antipasto is always a winner and is different according to what is in season. Their grilled fresh veggies + EVOO really can't be beat. For pizza, honestly, i've had them all and have loved every single one. But my FAVORITE is Biancoverde, add prosciutto.

On the other hand, I just didn't see anything that differentiated it from other pizza restaurants I frequent. Pizzeria Bianco has some interesting ingredient combinations, but most of which you can find on a build-your-own menu. They are a premium price (~$15-20 for a personal) for good quality but not great quantity (something that matters to my crew).

We went for my wife's birthday around 4pm on a Wednesday.  We actually walked right in and sat down.  We were both shocked as the least amount of time we have ever waited was well over 3 hours.  

The staff was more attentive on where we sat than giving us a genuine greeting even though the place was empty except two other tables.  We put in our order for a margherita with prosciutto, a wise guy, and a caprese salad.

The bread came out cold with some oil to dip it in.  I can't remember if it was always cold but it would be nice if they threw it in the oven for 30 seconds before they serve it to you.  Next our pizzas came out and the margherita was missing the prosciutto.  Not a big deal.  Maybe he didn't hear me, maybe the cook didn't hear him?  My wife confirms I did request it and I'm not losing my mind.  The pizzas were good but lacking the usual special touch.  The crust was the best part which is not unusual but what was unusual was the rest was very lack luster.

Even though the shop was dead our waiter never came back to us and was back behind the bar laughing and chatting with other staff members.  Finally a blonde woman asks if we would like our bill.  She brings it to us and when I give her my card I gently advise her they forgot my prosciutto and it's on the bill.  Another guy brings the bill back for me to sign.  The 6 dollar prosciutto is still on it.  I inform him that there was no prosciutto and I told the other woman but it's still here.  I don't know if she thought I was just making small talk or what but I sure am not paying 6 bones for some sliced ham that wasn't even on my pizza.  He took care of it.

Here's the deal.  I don't know if it's because I didn't wait 3-5 hours to eat or if it's just falling apart without Chef Bianco but PB has definitely lost it's way and is quickly losing the legacy he created whether they want to acknowledge it or not.  I used to think the staff was short and slightly rude because of how busy it was and dealing with upset starving customers brings them down but now I know that is not the case.  They are just not good at what they do and have been there getting away with it for too long.  Just because PB is famous and Chef Bianco is world renown doesn't mean you are.  

The dough is good enough to come back for but there is simply no way I would ever wait in line to eat here again.

We had a party of eight people and went to line up at 3:25pm.  People were not exactly lined up there but just sitting around talking.  There was no organization at all..just by memory and the honor system.  I thought it might cause problems but I went with the flow.  That was a big mistake.  For some reason, there was a couple who many parties accepted to cut in front even though we got there before them (which the couple admitted to).  So we stepped in front of them in line and acknowledged that other people were in front of us as well but we were definitely in front of those guys.  What followed was a heated disagreement and bad tensions that put a big damper on the evening.  

I can't believe that it was like this but my brother (who has been there 3 times) said it's like this every time.  I suggest if you go then either have someone start a list or talk with everyone to know the order right when you get there to avoid possible problems.

Anyways, the rush to line up is really to get in the first seating, otherwise you will have to wait another couple of hours depending on your party size.  After they open and they get your party on their list, you can go next door to the pub and relax there and they even call you when you are up which is a big plus.

After getting in, our party sat at the bar and could see Chris at work in his mastery.  Service was good and the atmosphere was good.  We each ordered a pizza so we could try all varieties.  My favorites were the Margherita and Wiseguy but my brother loves the Biancoverde.  The pizza was great like I heard and expected.  Worth the wait?  Yes, because I needed to test the hype and continue my quest on finding the best pizza places out there.  Best in America?  No..I can name a couple in Brooklyn that I prefer but it's top 10 taste wise for me (so far).",1,1,1

I'm torn between giving it 4 or 5 stars. In the end, I decided on 4 because 1) there's no 1\/2 star and 2) the goshdarn wait! 
We were a larger party (8) so I did try to make a reservation in advance but calling 2 weeks in advance is not enough. You need to call a month in advance apparently. The first time I called the woman who answered was very abrupt and basically told me ""no"". But I was so hell bent on making it happen I called again and the second time a different woman was very friendly and told me other options making it sound possible.

So i took her advice and went in at 5:30, put our names in, went back to where we were staying for awhile, called at 7, and returned with everybody at 8pm. We were seated very shortly after arriving. For the most part service was friendly, some more than others, some were abrupt but i really can't complain. (I heard the owner has asthma and is not there very often anymore?) 

So the most important--the food. We started with the farmer's market salad and the antipasti plate which had the most delicious roasted vegetables!( I woke up the next day thinking about them) They are not to be missed! And then since we had a large group, we ordered one of every pizza to try. I really enjoyed the wise guy pizza which has fennel sausage and to which we added mushrooms--good call. Another favorite was the one with pistachio nuts. A surprising fave was the cheeseless pizza which had a really rich,flavorful tomato sauce and went well with the wine we ordered (can't remember the name but it was a local wine, [who woulda thought Arizona has good wines?], a sangiovese) 
All in all we had a lovely evening and everyone in the group enjoyed the pizzas. i think there were different favorites among everyone so all pizzas can and should be recommended. It just takes a little planning to make it all come together. 
I would love to visit again and maybe give it that 5th star.

Today I did what any self respecting pizza lover would do, I made it my priority to go to Pizzeria Bianco's for lunch. First off its in a great little area of Downtown Phoenix, Heritage Park. I walked through the park from the parking structure (don't forget to get a validation) to the pizzeria. For lunch time it was relatively quiet. There was a business lunch happening to my right and a woman and her two children directly in front of me. I sat at the bar and ordered the Margherita. I watched as my pie was placed in the wood burning stove. It wasn't long before I was greeted with an amazing looking meal. 

Fresh mozzarella, tasty, TASTY organic tomato sauce (which you can buy for the low low price of $9 DOLLARS A BOTTLE!!) and the best part, the basil. Yes that's right, on top of pizza mountain there is fresh basil growing in abundance. The combination of the mozzarella, tomatoes and basil accompanied with the oven fired crust made me a very happy boy. I decided against my better judgement not to eat the entire meal. I wanted to save some for my wife to try. My intent was to eat half, then, I was only going to eat three pieces. Soon I said to myself ""I'll just take the small piece and leave two more."" My only hope is I can shame myself into holding on to the last two pieces to bring home to the Mrs. 

After my meal it was back to the garage, jump in the car and off to work. When I went to turn my ticket in, $12 was the charge for 36 minutes of dining. Wow $12? Did I park in Dubai? Am I supposed to pay in gold bullion? Luckily I received a validation ticket from the resturant which immediately freed me from the underground parking without cost. Go to Pizzeria Bianco, you deserve it. ($22 bucks is a lot to spend on lunch. Don't do it too often or you'll be a poor man)",2,4,1

No worries, folks, Chris Bianco's white pizza is legit, and my favorite pizza on the menu at the quaint old-house location on Adams St.

I should know, after all - the supplier I was dining with made sure that we ordered one of every single pizza on the menu, as he was so passionate about Bianco, and wanted to make sure we understood the hype (which is definitely real). Everything about Pizzeria Bianco helps this place live up to its reputation as one of the top pizzerias in the nation: the cute, quaint brick building, the charming ""on the square"" location, the rustic nature of the romantic and intimate interior, the candlelit space, the open-view brick oven pizza, and the quality of the employees. Well, of course, the pizza speaks for itself as well.

There's a reason local Phoenicians (is that what people who dwell in PHX are called) recommend this spot to everyone that visits town. While they don't accept reservations, they were pretty lenient about our entire party of 8 not being present while allowing our partial party to occupy the largest table in the restaurant as the rest of us arrived.

We didn't waste any time once we had all arrived, and immediately, the change in mood from ""work day"" to ""relaxed dinner"" was palpable. We ordered two Antipasti platters, which were tasty enough, but obviously not the stars of the Neapolitan-style pizza show here at Bianco. Besides, I didn't want to spoil my appetite with salami and toasted bread while awaiting the mountains of pizza about to come within my reach!

On the current Adams St. location menu, there are 6 varieties of pizza. We started with one of each, and then ordered a second of our favorite pies. In the opening lines of my review, I mention that amazing white pizza: the 'Biancoverde.' You best believe we ordered and devoured two of those pies. Also outstanding was the 'Rosa,' with its delicious onions and unexpectedly awesome Arizona pistachios. Perhaps one of the most auspicious pies on the menu that really blew us away was the simple 'Marinara,' which is served without cheese. Yes, you read that right. Their marinara sauce, oregano, garlic, and crust are SO GOOD, that you really don't even need cheese for an authentic Neapolitan and awesome pizza experience. It kind of messes with your mind at first, and then you realize you've eaten the whole thing. I also recall the 'Wiseguy' being memorable for its fennel sausage!

Overall, everything we tried was fantastic, and we all had our favorites, but we also all concurred that the Biancoverde was a rightful namesake\/bearer of the Bianco name.",14,5,5

We had heard a lot of good things about this place and decided to give it a try on a Friday afternoon. We went there pretty early and were lucky enough not to have to wait for a table. The service was pleasant enough but we were starving so we were primarily focused on the food. Our pizzas came out fairly fast. We ordered the Wiseguy and the Rosa (with extra mushrooms for the latter). The first few bites were good (we now think it was because we were so hungry) but over the next couple of minutes the pizzas became less and less pleasurable to eat. The crust was thin (no issue there, we both appreciate a good thin-crust pizza) and very very hard. So hard, in fact, that it hurt the roofs of our mouths and we could feel it for a couple of days afterwards. I had to keep washing it down with water to soften each bite. While I enjoyed the flavors of the Rosa, I probably had about a tablespoon's worth of sauce and toppings on mine, and it dried out within minutes. My husband had a similar complaint about the Wiseguy, and upon tasting it, I thought it also could have used a little more flavor. We both felt the crust tasted like a dried-out ciabatta. The only reason we finished the hard crusts was that we were still hungry.
Overall, we definitely won't be going back there. Grossly overpriced for what it is. I can't even imagine how upset we would have been if we'd had to wait for a table given the quality of the meal. And the pizza certainly didn't rank anywhere near our top 20.",1,0,0

1. Wait-time: Before I actually had my first dining experience there, I had tried 4 times previously to eat at Pizzeria Bianco. They don't take reservations, and the line is always out the door (or at least with 4-5 other groups ahead of you). On the day I actually had enough time to wait, I waited around 30 minutes to get seated, and another 10 or so for a waiter, and another 20 after that for the food to come out, for about an hour of total waiting time. 
**One good thing about the wait was that they had another building for you to sit and order appetizers\/drinks if you wanted before you got seated.

2. Food: I don't quite understand the hype of this pizza. The crust was burnt and the toppings were not the best either- I tried three types of pizza, sharing it with the friends I was with, but honestly, none of them struck me as absolutely amazing. 

3. Small room: I would estimate that there are about 8 tables at the place. Even after waiting for so long, we were stuck at the farthest corner of the restaurant by the restroom, and even that table was severely cramped. One of my friends was squished into the corner while another was awkwardly eating off of a side.

The decor was nice, the waitstaff was excellent.
The wait, well let's just say it is not worth it to wait even a half hour for this stuff. Go eat at Parlour or Cibo and you will be just as happy with no wait.
Would only go here again if someone held my place in line and I could swoop in here at the last moment.

I always start with the Antipasto platter & Spiedini, although if it's just one other person & myself, I'll skip the Spiedini.  Their Antipasto platter is definitely my favorite anywhere, hands down.  It's served warm and all the vegetables, cheeses, and meats literally melt in my mouth.  I'm salivating thinking about it.  The Rosa and the Biancoverde are my favorite pizzas.  (The Margherita is always a classic, but I'll usually only order it if I'm with a lot of people.)  The Rosa comes with onions, pistachios, and parmigiano reggiano cheese which, although sounds unusual, is amazing.  The Biancoverde is covered in arugula and melty cheese.  Part of the Pizzeria Bianco goodness is that all the ingredients come from the farmers' market so everything is always fresh and local.  Ooo and the crust.  Wood-fried, with the right balance of crispy & doughy.  (Don't overdo it on the bread!  Save your appetite for finishing the pizza!)

* on a nippy and overcast afternoon 4 of my restaurant colleagues and I patiently waited 2 hours and 45 min. for a table.
* My first exposure to Pizzeria Bianco (PB) was while reading Peter Reinhart's book ""American Pie"" in 2004.
* I am a research Chef - my job entails depth of research on various food items. I've done extensive research on Pie's around the US and have dined at some of the most reputed pizzerias throughout the country.

The Story:
* After reading several of the reviews here I've concluded that PB is not for everyone.  I won't go into details about how incredible this place is or how every inch of PB can be summed by a quote from Chris Bianco in the book ""American Pie"" - ""Pizza is my metaphor, and I believe my mission in life is to make the best pizza in the world.  I really do.""  I won't fill this review gleaming about the spiedini appetizer that my group of 5 professional foodies actually wanted to play ""paper, rock, scissors"" over for the last piece.  If you've done your research you already know that Bianco's ""metaphor within the metaphor"" of his pizza's  is the Rosa. And you should already know that the Rosa experience is the experience of all experiences in the world of pizza's while maybe actually being the best pizza in the world!  But you don't have to hear that from me.  What I want to talk about is the actual experience of PB - because if you are going to PB for the best pizza in the world then your expectations will fall far short of that goal - In summation you go to Pizzeria Bianco for everything - the wait, the conversation before the seating, the excitement of actually getting into the place and then finishing with the bragging rights to say you've been there, done that, and hopefully got a copy of the menu or at least a t-shirt (like I did).

What to expect:
* a wait - all of the rumors are true. You will wait to get on the wait list and then the cuties who take the names will give you an estimate of the time you will wait to get a table - that wait is pretty accurate so don't think that the Pizza Gods will part the clouds and drop pies from heaven any minute sooner than your first estimate.  If you have a difficult time holding a conversation for more than 30 minutes - stay home and order the new butter crust pizza from Domino's. Trust me, you'll be better off.
* Adverse weather during your wait.  Let's face it, Scottsdale is not known for it's cool temps and rainy days.  You see where I'm going with this?
* Great conversations, no distractions, anticipation.  All of these components make for a great meal at any place in the world.  PB provides you with slightly more opportunity to indulge in bonding.  I found out that I actually enjoy spending some down time with my co-workers.  We had a great time waiting, drinking, texting, eating olives, nibbling on cheese (offered at Bar Bianco next door) and chatting.
* Artisan Pizza - No this is not your average Wolfgang Puck pizza, nor is it a deep dish Chicago, and don't even compare this to a ""thin crust"" NY pizza.  This is classic Neapolitan style pizza at it's finest.
* great Ingredients - Pistachio's, prosciutto, red onions, etc, etc...  All of it is quality and great.
* Professional waitstaff - some peeps may be turned off by a waiter who does not stumble over words and descriptors. some peeps also don't like to get recommendations from a waiter nor do they like to have said professional waiter in a t-shirt.  You see where I'm going here?
* A small 40 seats (or so) restaurant with a very small menu.
* An older crowd.  I mention this because it's relevant for  two reasons. 1. Disposable income 2. A general need for simple cuisine done really well 3. quite a bit more patience than your average 23 year old and 4. usually well versed the finer things in life. (I know I said 2 things...)
* Some of the best Neopoliton pizza you can have without traveling to Italy.

What not to Expect:
* Instant gratification.
* An American dining experience.
* The best pizza in the world or even the best pizza in the U.S.  That designation is very personal and very subjective.  

The Slice:
* I think I could have had the best pizza in the world had I had dinner with Miriam Leone and drove off in a black Ferrari F430 to a suite at the Phoenician - but I digress....  For me - Pizzeria Mozza is the best pizza in the country, I've had some great Neopoliton pizza consistently at Il Ritrovo in Sheboygan (of all places), and I love Grimaldi's coal fired pizza in NY but really every single one of those places is distinctly different.  If I could give PB another star I would - primarily because the EXPERIENCE was one of the best food trips I've ever made.  The Pizza is great as was everything we had at PB.  I highly recommend the place only if you can maintain an open mind (if you look at some of the worst reviews here you will have a difficult time understanding what was actually bad about the food).

I think that title belongs to Di Fara's in NYC... but let's get to my review of Pizzeria Bianco.

We arrived nearly two hours before opening to find a line of 25 people and patiently waited for the restaurant to open. Around 4:30 p.m., Frank the owner came outside to tell everyone about the ingredients that are used, how the brick oven works and to thank everyone for their patience and patronage - he really is an awesome guy!

Once we got in the place (total wait time was 3.5 hours) we ordered:
- Anti-pasta
- Margherita 
- Wise Guy
- Bianca Verde
- Rosa 

The anti-pasta was delicious but my favorite part was the bread that came with olive oil - this bread was seriously addicting! It was doughy, crisp and had a wonderful charred flavor (in a good way, not a bad way).

The margherita pizza was good but not my favorite, in fact, it tasted better room temperature.

The wise guy had carmelized onions and their own blend of fennel sausage. This pizza was tasty as well, but again, not my favorite and tasted much better when it was room temperature vs. straight from the oven.

The two pizzas that were mind-blowingly delicious were the Bianca Verde and the Rosa. The verde had no sauce, mozzeralla and ricotta cheeses and was topped with arugala and drizzled with delicious olive oil. The combination was absolutely delicious! The pizza was creamy and wonderfully delicious!

The Rosa was equally amazing - a pizza with no sauce or cheese, instead incredibly delicious parmesan cheese covered the pizza and was topped with pistachios and onions! OMG, it isn't fair that something is this delicious!

I'll definitely come back to this place - primarily because I don't live in Arizona so it's a special treat - but next time I'd just stick with the Verde and Rosa pizzas, these truly are incredible!",2,1,1

I had a Sprite and the Sonny Boy.  The Sprite is the Mexican kind in the bottle made with real sugar and was a pleasant surprise.  Watching the bartender fill up the glass for it by sticking said glass into the ice bin was not.  Thankfully, all the rest of the staff used the scoop to fill up the glasses, and the Sprite came chilled, so I just skipped the glass with ice.

The Sonny Boy was very, very good. I highly recommend it.  They were not stingy with the Sopressato, which was nice to see.

The staff were all very friendly and responsive, props to them.

All in all though, I have Settebello in Vegas, which is almost exactly what Pizzeria Bianco is, just with a larger menu and at a lower cost.  I do not at all regret going into Pizzeria Bianco, but to be honest I would not do so again.  My individual pizza and soda cost $27 after standard tip.  That is insane.  The exact same thing at the other equivalent places in other towns would only set me back  $17.

One gal did the unthinkable and ordered the Biancoverde with red sauce, so was able to try both the traditional white Biancoverde and her modified version. Both were fantastic (and preferable to my margherita!) but Chris had it right without the red sauce.  No shock there!

I've eaten there twice, once in a group of three, the other time as a group of seven. I didn't mind the wait so much during the group of three (2.5 hours) because we found a comfy spot over at Bar Bianco (in the heat) and chatted away. The group of seven though was trying. A 4.5 hour wait that included an impatient 13-year-old, freezing temperatures, mud, and about eight bottles of wine for six people. Not a good idea. My sister eats at Pizzeria Bianco about once a month and knows the owners\/staff through business and didn't want to piss them off through complaining about the wait. You'd think we'd get better service or have a faster wait thanks to the connection, but it didn't happen. Make reservations if you have a party of 6 or over. It will save your sanity.

I do have to say that the food is delicious once you trudge through the wait. My favorites are the Caprese salad and the Wiseguy (I'm a sucker for sausage and onions). I've had slices of the other pizzas (the Margherita is great and the Sonny Boy is good too if you like olives). The freshness of the ingredients and dough do shine through.

The killer though is the wait. If they had a bit more ambiance outside (perhaps more tables or entertainment or even passing out little samples of the pizza as an amuse bouche) or revamp Bar Bianco to accommodate more people, it would be better.

When the pizza came, our server and everyone else ignored us. No manager even came to apologize. So when we got the bill we expected at least 20% off especially since we didn't want the salad.

We had the margherita pizza (this one at least may have been the best version of this classic that I have I've ever had) and the biancoverde (an amazing white pizza).  Simple.  Fresh.  Delicious.  Those are the three perfect words to describe Pizzeria Bianco.  The menu is small but everything looks tasty.  The ingredients are the definition of fresh.  The tomato sauce on the margherita tastes like it was cooked just before going into the wood fire oven.  I'd believe you if you told me the basil was picked when I ordered the pie.  I can say the same about the biancoverde.  The cow that provided the ricotta could've been milked that morning. The augural and rosemary, were also ridiculously fresh.  The prices may seem a touch high, but the quality of the food is worth every penny.   If I'm going to overindulge something so high in carbs and calories, I might as well know that it's not all processed junk.  The two pizzas were more than enough food for two people; but I won't lie, if there was a third pie, I would have happily consumed that one as well.

Everyone's top criticism of Pizzeria Bianco is the wait.  All I have to say about waiting hours for a pizza is this; You know what you're getting into before you enter the door.  Pizzeria Bianco isn't a place that most people stumble into on a whim.  It has a well deserved reputation, it's small, and you're most likely aware that there is a good possibility that you're dining experience is going to be two to three hours or more.  My fiancé and arrived early on Saturday afternoon (4:30) expecting an hour wait.  We were told it would be about an 1:10 and we went next door to get a drink and wait.  To our surprise, in only about 15 minutes, a pair of seats at the bar opened up.  Lucky us.

Pizzeria Bianco is also now open for lunch.  From what I hear (and have just experienced) it is a lot easier to get in than it used to be.  You know you've been wanting to try it for a while.  Go ahead and do it already!",1,1,1

My family decided to stop by after discovering that Pizzeria Bianco was on a ""Must-Try Pizza"" List. We ordered a Margherita Pizza to-go and while we waited, we were served some bread and olive oil. Now I've had my share of olive oil before and this stuff was FRESH. Like freshly pumped out of the olives fresh. It was light and refreshing and absolutely delicious. The pizza itself was so thin and delicious with the fresh basil and the thin crust. Soooo good.

Everything is made fresh so you cannot call in your order and pick it up in 20 minutes. You will have to go and order in person and wait. But it's SUPER quick. Just go and enjoy some bread while you wait. You will not be disappointed. =]

Only until recently, when my husband and I made a point of stopping here for lunch on our road trip to Tucson did we get to find out for ourselves what everyone's been talking about. First thing to know, they have a $3 valet lot, that they conveniently charge on your bill, so you don't have to worry if you don't have change on you to pay for it. Secondly, they have an outdoor patio that is dog friendly, which we took advantage of. We arrived close to 2pm on a weekday, so the lunch crowd had gone, and there was no wait for service. We ended up ordering a Rosa and a Margherita pizza. The Rosa is considered a ""white"" pizza since it has no tomato sauce on it. As a result, I slightly preferred the Margherita, since they use fresh tomatoes to make their sauce, which is really tasty. But the Rosa was yummy too, if you're looking to try something less traditional. 

What makes their pizza so great is that it is completely authentic to how pizza is made in Italy: fresh tomato sauce, a thin, crisp and lightly burnt crust, all baked in a wood fired oven. It may not be to everyone's liking, but if you are a pizza purest, then this place is for you!",0,0,0

It's a daughter pizza with red onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, rosemary and pistachios. It has an interesting flavor. The rosemary and pistachios combination make it a unique selection.

Even after adjusting for the hype factor, I thought the experience was worthwhile. I recommend the Margherita with prosciutto, but not the pizza with fennel sausage. I'm not a huge proponent of Los Angeles-based Pizzeria Mozza, but the sausage itself is done better there. 

I planned my dinner here as a side trip during Spring Training, which is relevant because it's the busiest time of year. If avoiding a four hour line is of any interest to you, the smartest way to approach to dinner at Bianco is to plan your entire day around it. If you check in at 4 PM on a Saturday, the line should be about an hour long.

Actually the way I look at it, it was just a 3 course meal at 3 different locations.  We had our first course appetizer, the Soppressata sandwich at Pane Bianco that was 5 stars and drove straight from there to our Main course at Pizzeria Bianco.  This is James Beard Award winning chef Chris Bianco's original location.  I've heard about this spot before as one of the top pizza joints in the country.  I've been to many of the greatest pizzerias in the country, so Pizzeria Bianco had some pretty big shoes to fill.

Tim, said his favorite pie here is the Wiseguy pizza.  This had wood roasted onions, house smoked mozzarella, and fennel sausage.  Perhaps some olive oil drizzled on the crust, but other than that there was really no sauce here.  This was an excellent pizza and I highly recommend it.  Although I'm usually a purist and love a traditional red sauce on a pie, I didn't miss it here.  The wood roasted onions, were nice thick strips of onion, but pretty much caramelized.  Not to the point of mush though.  I'm not sure their technique for wood roasting them, but there is way more to them than that, meaning lots of butter or perhaps they are marinated first.  The star of the show was the fennel sausage.  I wouldn't get a pizza here without getting their sausage.  Sliced diagonally, each piece of sausage was a good size.  The smoked mozzarella, melted in a very creamy way, more like a burrata would.  At first I thought some ricotta was added, but no, it was just the creamy mozzarella.  The pizza crust was very thin, and perhaps a little too thin for the weight of these toppings.  It could have been charred a little more as well.  But I'm nitpicking at this point as it had a great flavor to it and this was a 5 star pie for sure.

The pizzas here are all individual size, so the 2nd one we split was the Sonny Boy.  This is a traditional red sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella, salami, and gaeta olives.  I found the gaeta olives to be way too powerful for this pizza and covered up the sweet tomato sauce flavor.  When I pushed them off, I was much happier.  I was also happier with the crust on this pie as it had a little more char to it and the crust, while just as thin, held up well and wasn't soggy.  What a difference an extra minute can make in a wood burning oven.  Since the salami was cooked, it was hard for me to determine what kind of ""salami"" it was.  It had a little spice like a soppressata, but I can't say for sure that it was.  4 stars

Is Pizzeria Bianco one of the top pizza places in the country?  I'm not so sure, it's very good though.  When I first had Lombardi's or Di Fara's in New York, I knew right away that those are two of the best pizzas I've ever tasted.  Since I'm left wondering....I'd say on the national scale of best of the best...4 stars is about right.  And it's definitely worth coming in for that Wiseguy pizza.

By the way, I know real Italian pizza. I eat it regularly. In Italy. So don't give me crap about, 'go eat at Domino's, you don't know good pizza.' I do. Believe me. I cook Italian (tuscan) regularly.

Pizzeria Bianco approaches traditional Italian pizza, so I'd ordinarily give it 3 stars. However I downgraded it to one due to the rude, rude, rude service and how incredibly overpriced it is.

Gotta hand it to Bianco though, he's got a good scam going. I mean, he's really got it figured out.

The sauce did not overtake the dough as it was light tasting and just enough to cover all areas of the pie.  The cheese had the right amount of cheesiness!  Overall, it was very well balance!  The portion was just right.  Just about any grown adult could finish this in one sitting!

You want more details?

Yesterday (my first time at Pizzeria Bianco)  I arrived at 5 minutes to 3 - I was second in the line.  As time passed, and more people arrived, we began chatting.  Just wandering from conversation to conversation - very relaxed - very laidback - casual - fun.

The family in 3rd place turned out to be regulars.  They're Italian.  They chatted amongst themselves in Italian.  They chatted with the rest of us in English - with a noticeable Italian accent.

The hostess (who is a knockout!) was charming.  I have no idea about the reviews claiming that she's rude.  Get some people skills people!

Being solo, I sat at the bar.  A glass of Dos Cabesas & a Margherita with red onions & garlic.

Those of us at the bar - all strangers to each other - chatted like we were at party at our next door neighbors'.  The ambience of this former machine shop - with the wood-burning brick pizza oven - is charming & romantic.  I will have to return with my GF.

The wine was smooth and delicious.  The pizza -- now yuh gotta understand - I worked at Gino's Pizza on East McDowell before you were born -- was AMAZING!  But, that's exactly what I expected.  My mouth told me that it's so very happy I took it to Bianco, and I like to make my mouth happy.

So, go.  Expect to wait.  Relax.  Chat with people.  Have fun.  Your mouth will.

At approx 4:45 (restaurant opens at 5:00) a terrential downpour hit PHX.

The front of the restaurant is all glass, the staff saw all of us out there getting drenched. At about 4:50 large sized hail began to pelt us. While running to a car for cover might have seemed like a good idea to an outsider, it had rained so hard it was flooding all around us, plus the wind, rain and the hail. Literally, all the staff was inside watching us outside and they did NOTHING. It appeared one of the guys was going to open the door but another guy said something to him and he backed away. At 4:55, a waitress opened the door far enough to stick out her head and told us the place next door was open and that we should go over there. Seriously, are you kidding me? I asked why she couldn't just let us in and she nodded her head 'no' and closed and LOCKED the door. Unbelievable, when they finally opened the door, at 5:00, they did nothing for us, they offered no comps and zero apology or understanding.

We had no issue with the wait and I think having some time to drink and chat at the cozy bar next door was a great way to kick-off our soon to be ""mind blowing"" pizza.  We got sat at the bar top and ordered two pizzas--the margarita and the fennel & sausage.  The pizzas were good, but not great.  The crust was soggy and it just didn't hit the taste buds the right way for us.  We sat next to a couple that had flown from Canada for one night just to go to Pizzeria Bianco.  They liked it more than us, but they said their expectations were higher, too.

The antipasto platter was fine, roasted peppers and fritatta being the best of it.  The cauliflower was vastly over roasted and swimming in oil which was disappointing but that still doesn't lower my rating.

I went around 2 pm, after the lunch rush and it still felt like the lunch rush.
I am from New Haven, CT where pizza is serious business and people will stand in line (rain or shine or even snow) for a pie from their favorite place. New Orleans has their trinity (onion, celery and bell pepper) and New Haven has the trinity as well: Pepe's, Sally's and Modern.
Anyway, back to Bianco. The the pies were excellent. For me, it starts with the crust. It was thin, very flavorful and held together with a firm texture that didn't just fall apart in your mouth. Kind of reminded me of the pies back home. The edge of the crust was puffy, crispy and had a few really dark spots. It was delightful. The sauce on the margherita was superb. Simple, not too thick, not too thin and adhered to the crust really well. The flavor combos on the wise guy were perfect. I like a little kick and would have added it if it were available. I never had the chance to ask our waiter as he was busy and did not check in on us.

* You will have to wait. Expect to wait. Expect the wait-time to be longer than you were told. Be patient. Hey, there's been a bar next door for a little while now. Go have a few drinks. Food tastes better anyway with the aid of the Booze Goddess coursing through your veins. Trust me, they'll find you.

* Do not be put off by the perceived rudeness of the staff. They're overworked and get lots of impatient, pushy idiots everyday (not you, of course. Other idiots). Also, it's more ""authentic"" that way. If you don't like it, don't go to Italy. Basta.

* The food's good. Only twice out of the dozen+ pizzas I've tried here was one burnt to the point of ""inedibility"". Bianco knows what he's doing. Let him do what he does. He uses the freshest ingredients and that's why you've waited hours to eat his food (i.e., it's worth it).

     I can't say I didn't like it, but I will say I don't love it, nor do I plan on ever going back. I honestly don't understand what all the hype is about. Bianco lacks customer service, size and comfort. The menu is limited and additions seem too costly for such small portions. 
     Needless to say, we ordered one pizza and that came down to exactly two slices each. Which still left us with traces of hunger after consuming the margherita with added sausage and mushrooms. To top it all off we felt like it lacked a certain kick, it was just too simple. A pizza too simple? Yeah, I'm not kidding.
The service was sub-par, with a ditsy girl sitting us down and then a server that after taking our order, and bringing it over, was nowhere to be found after, we even had to ask a different server to bring us additional drinks.
     Finally, the size, this place is cute but tiny, it gets uncomfortably busy and tight inside. I'm okay with closeness and all, but this was just too much that the table next to us kept dropping into our conversation. All we wanted was to enjoy our food and time there.

Some tips:  So of course you hear about the crazy long waits.  Make the most of your time if you have a three hour wait.  Go check out the Science Center's Body Worlds while you wait.  I think it's about $20 to get in, but it really is cool and kills a couple hours.  Then make your way back to Bar Bianco.  Get a bottle of wine and one of their appetizers (cheese dish is good, but small).  By the time you finish the bottle it's time to eat.  Also, I highly recommend going in the fall or spring on a really nice night so you can sit outside with your wine.  Enjoy!",4,0,2

(FUN FACT: back when pizzeria bianco was brand, spanking new...it was called 'the italian restaurant'.  searching for it didn't yield the results desired, so they renamed the restaurant 'pizzeria bianco')

I MADE IT!!!  after reading all the reviews about how long the wait was, i didn't know if i was going to be able to eat at pizzeria bianco on a short weekend trip. we were walking around downtown phoenix in the heat. it was uncomfortable...and only the end of march. we were going to pass by to see if it was possible to eat there...

it's near ASU in an area with cute little brick buildings. NO LINE!!

SCORE.

okay, we're eating here. it's LINNER -- lunch dinner circa 2:30pm. nick bianco, himself,  was at the restaurant at the time. he's personable and friendly. 

complimentary bread that was soft and chewy on the inside with a crunchy crust served with EVOO. we ordered the tomato, mozzarella, basil salad. the flavors and textures were ultra delicious. the curds are from wisconsin, but they stretch it out themselves to make the mozzarella. tomatoes were ripe and sweet. they go local with whatever they can. the flour is made in arizona.

we opted for a pizza that was half margherita and half rosa.  now for the taste test of the long awaited pizza. WOW!!!  fresh ingredients in the correct amount put together with the  MOST AMAZING CRUST. 

loved the margherita!!  the rosa was very unique as it had no sauce just great ingredients of chopped pistachios, onions, etc. 

I WAS IN PIZZA HEAVEN.

for comparison's sake since we are from socal.  we did have pizzeria mozza before.  well, pizzeria bianco is many times better than that. but don't take my word for it, try it yourself.

TIP: 
1) the reason why there is a line most of the time is because the restaurant is small. people who know better come in 2s. 2 or 4, no more.

Is it because someone, somewhere years ago in an A-list city wrote a flattering review? Or is it simply because there is always a line and it's really hard to get in unless you wait, thus adding to the mystique? I don't know but I can honestly say that Bianco is very overrated. It's most definitely a decent pizza, but 3 hour wait decent? I think not. In fact I can name 5 other places in Phoenix alone that have as good and better pies. 

First, the wait. I don't care about waiting, as long as the process is orderly and controlled, which at Bianco it is not. Our party arrived at about 4pm on a Wednesday, and there were around a dozen or so people already waiting. No biggie. Well, as 5pm approached, it was suddenly like Euro Disney in France with entire families cutting the line and people coming out from nowhere to jump into the action. When something was mentioned to the hostess, she politely said they ""would look into it"". Right. Has anyone running this place ever heard of a sign in sheet like they do everywhere else in the free world? Honestly the pizza could even be much better than it actually is and it still would not be worth the stress and weirdness of the 'line' waiting to get it. The biggest issue in this regard is the staff and their indifference because, quite honestly, why should they care? They will always be sold out, every night, right?

Ok the food. When we did get seated 1.5 hours later, we decided to order 3 of the 6 pizzas on the menu. The white pizzas were bland, but really salty, and the red pizzas were more flavorful, and really salty. The crust was good, but soggy in the middle. The fennel sausage was average at best, but the roasted onions were tasty. Honestly the appetizer of prosciutto stuffed with fontina was the best thing we had. They had a nice wine list, and they do score points for offering an outstanding local wine that's hard to find in restaurants. Everything was reasonably priced. The atmosphere is quaint, but truly not that memorable, and I think the only reason anyone comments on it is that it's in Phoenix, and it's not in a strip mall. The bar next door is quite charming, and it's worth mentioning that our server there was awesome and kept the drinks flowing. I actually wonder if much of the reason for the popularity of this place is that everyone is half-cocked by the time they actually eat any pizza.

If there wasn't such a hype surrounding this place, and if you could just sign up when you arrive, like any other restaurant, it would be much more enjoyable. The expectations are too high and unfortunately Bianco is just too complacent to live up to it.",5,4,2

The lady and I were enjoying the zombie walk when we all of a sudden decided to top off the already romantic evening with a date at Bianco's. Believe it or not, we waited less than an hour for a table. That being said, I wasn't wasted when I finally got to my pizza and I wasn't a pissed off\/hungry food nazi waiting to hate every bite. I was completely neutral going in.

We ordered some bread and olives to start, and they were both tasty! I would have preferred some kalamatas but the olives we received were good enough. The bread was great, and with a little bit of olive oil and salt, it was even better. As for pizzas, we ordered a Sonny Boy and a half Wiseguy, half Rosa. The Rosa was good. The rosemary and pistachios really went well with each other. The Wiseguy (the pizza that I thought would be my favorite) was just okay. The sausage had fennel in each chew, and the onions were a nice touch, but there wasn't that pop of flavor like I got from each bite of the Rosa. It's important for fancy pizza in my opinion. And, last but not least, there was the Sonny Boy. This pizza was definitely my favorite of the three. The salami, the cheeses and the olives went perfectly with one another! Those first few chews were the highlight of my visit to the pizzeria. I would order that pizza again in a heartbeat.

My bottom line...? It's good. Period. I'm not sure that I'd want to wait for 3+ hours to eat there (that's silly considering all the other great pizza places not too far from there), but if the same kind of situation that I had my first visit came about, I could see myself returning to Pizzeria Bianco.",10,5,9

Having now sat for perhaps thirty minutes while pies entered and exited the oven being delivered to many around us the time would finally arrive to taste the oft raved pizza of team Bianco as all four of our selections arrived simultaneously covering the table and filling the air with the smells of smoke, yeast, pork, tomato, and basil.  With much sharing to be done and pictures taken the next twenty or so minutes would consist of much less talking and far more eating than the previous thirty and beginning first with my selection - well - let's just say it lived up to the hype as the ROSA with Red Onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, and Arizona Pistachios may just be the best ""specialty pizza"" I've ever tasted.  Beginning first with the crust - an expert balancing act between the thinness of a Neapolitan like Lucali and the chewy hole structure of that at Great Lake - it was nearly perfect as the slight char from the wood oven gave each pie a lovely crunch yet pliable interior that could support the ingredients without disturbing them.  Moving next to the toppings - no sauce here - just thinly sliced onions, intense salty cheese, crunchy smooth pistachios, and a touch of rosemary to pique everything else.  Marvelous.

Moving next to another of Bianco's signatures, the WISEGUY with wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, and Fennel Sausage I was pleasantly surprised by the mildness of both the onions and the fennel, both present but not overwhelming, while the slight spice of the sausage floated above the pools of creamy cow's milk mozzarella.  Another well balanced pie, though I do feel it could have done with just a touch less olive oil...a small quibble, to be sure.

For the third choice, the BIANCOVERDE with Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, and Arugula would be the only pizza we modified from the menu description - in this case by adding a $3 supplement of Organic 'La Quercia' Prosciutto Americano from Iowa that was every bit worth the cost.  Again featuring that same pliable smoky crust but this time topping it first with the trio of cheeses before adding the arugula and prosciutto after it exited the oven this ""Salad Pizza"" was a valuable addition to the lineup largely because of the quality of the ingredients and the balance achieved by using each lightly.  From the smooth mozzarella to the puddles of ricotta and tangy Parmigiano up through the slight bitters of the greens and the powerful saline notes of the pork everything simply clicked though for some the lack of spice was an issue - an issue easily amendable by the red pepper provided on request (try getting that at Una, Lucali, or Great Lake.)

For the final selection, that of the man who'd experienced Chris' work longer and more frequently than the rest of us combined, there was no way I was going to miss out on the MARGHERITA while I was here and thankfully he'd ordered it (thus preventing me from ordering both it and the ROSA.)  With the stars of the show well known - simply the freshest Tomato Sauce with light hints of sweetness, oregano, and garlic plus Fresh Mozzarella, and Basil - this was a no nonsense sort of pie that hit on all cylinders; tangy, creamy, aromatic, smoky, and perfect.  While not the absolute greatest Margherita I've ever had, a top 5 member for sure and when paired with the rest of the menu, the service, and the setting a pizza definitely worthy of the fame especially considering the fact that Bianco uses all local ingredients including tomatoes from California in the making of his sauce.

Eating, sharing, talking, and then eating some more while the service checked in occasionally to see if we needed anything else our time at Bianco felt much longer than it was and when it was all said and done only four slices remained - two of the WISEGUY and two the BIANCOVERDE - all wrapped up and going home with their respective owners while I took home with me the memories of some of the best pizza I've ever experienced and (perhaps more importantly) the experience of meeting with some great people for outstanding pizza in a setting where people have a passion for what they are doing without all the pretense.  Yeah Chris didn't build the oven and furniture by hand like Lucali, and perhaps Pizzeria Bianco doesn't fly all their ingredients in from Italy like Una, and sure Chris' health prevents him from being ever present at the oven like Dom at DiFara or Nick at Great Lake but in the end the results are the same...this is some really great pizza well worth going out of your way for.",8,3,7

This place has been bookmarked for years and the one time I tried about 3 years ago I was told it was a 4 hour wait and really, who did I think I was not to expecting that!? Hahaha... I was slightly offended at the time but now it's just funny.

So last weekend we took my significant others small children to the Az Science Center next door. Turns out there was a 'Sriracha Festival' going on in Heritage Square which encompasses the science center, several historical buildings including Pizzeria Bianco and a parking garage. SUPER cool little spot!

Anyway, after the science thing we decided to stop by to see if there was a wait around 2:00 on Saturday. There wasn't, we were seated immediately, I was so excited! The house Pinot Grigio was great, margarita pizza, awesome! The Caprese salad.. Amazing! Service was fantastic! 

I really don't have anything negative other than I was surprised the menu was so limited but I understand they're expanding into other areas with more extensive menus etc...

It was a great experience. Am I glad I didn't wait the 4 hours the last time I tried? Yes, definitely. Will I go back if I'm literally not walking by? Nope.",4,2,6

I love the Wiseguy! Grilled onions never tasted so good. The weirdest thing was the very last bite tasted the best. It's like I'm emotionally attached to that last bite and how it made me feel. YUM!!!

I hate the Sonny Boy but I'm not an olive person. Every bite was overwhelming with an olive taste. YUCK!!!

I could of done without the 2 and half hour wait though. Since there is a wait, people get super drunk. When you're sober and everyone around you is drunk, it can be a tad bit annoying and loud. The restaurant is super small. There is no room to really have an intimate experience when people are yelling in your ear.

Also, I could care less for the service. I guess when you're not hurting for business you could act however you want. I totally don't agree with that statement. I hope the staff reads these yelp reviews and improves the service. Eventually, the bad service will outweigh the taste of the food. Then people will stop coming.

If I ever had the chance to come back, I would probably order takeout. The website said you couldn't but I saw someone who did. It also said they validate, and they do but it doesn't cover the whole parking fee.

Overall, I'm still happy that I got to experience the BEST PIZZA for myself. It's pretty cool to say I've had Pizzeria Bianco. So I would suggest anyone to give it a try just expect the wait and the rudeness. Hopefully, the food will make it all worth for you.",0,0,0

The pizza is serious here. Nancy Silverton mentioned it was one of the inspirations for her pizza, so I had to try it out. It is a simple dough (not like Silverton's). Was told it is made with OO flour, fresh yeast cake, water, sea salt, and little bit of dough from the day before. The wood burning brick oven looks to be the real deal, with a thick black smoke floating a few inches above the cooking surface. Had the margherita, biancoverde, and Sonny Boy. All where good and only the highest quality ingredients are used. The crust had enough charred to imbue with the earthy scent and quality that makes crust so habit forming. The stand out was the margherita. The oven does wonders for the tomato sauce and really brings it alive. Probably one of the best margherita I have ever and had works perfectly with the simplicity of the dough. The gaeta olives on the Sonny Boy are excellent but paired with the salami made for a slightly rich pie. Lastly, the cheeses of the biancoverde paired well with the sharpness of the arugula and highlighted their fresh richness. An excellent pie overall. The place is small, cute, and busy. Waits can be long but are worth it. There are very nice benches outside to enjoy a beer while waiting for your table. Service is solid, informative, and friendly. An excellent value (especially for the quality). Phoenix is very fortunate to have a place of this high a quality.",1,0,0

It's supposed to be the best pizza place in the USA.  We decided to give it a try about a year ago. We got there at 5 pm and the line was really long and we were told the wait would be 3 hours. We decided probably not worth the wait.  After reading the mixed reviews on Yelp we decided we were committed to the wait and would give it another try. We got there at 3:30 pm on March 18th, a Friday night. The restaurant holds 43 people. We ended up being #37 and #38 lol. I would recommend getting there at least by 3:30 pm so that you will make it in the 1st round into the restaurant. If you come any later than that you will probably have to wait 3+ hours.

The waiter and staff were extremely friendly and quick. We were served bread and oil. The bread was very hard and dry but we still ate it all. We
also ordered salads- the local organic greens with red vinaigrette. It was literally that. Ok, but very fresh. I ordered the Margherita pizza with the fennel sausage. It was really good. Best pizza ever....not to me. My husband ordered the Wiseguy pizza -wood roasted onion, house smoked mozzarella, and fennel sausage. He liked it as well and said he liked my pizza better. Also stated not the best pizza he's ever had.

I arrived at Pizzeria Bianco downtown Phoenix on Adams St. prepared for a repeat of my wonderful dining experience a week earlier at their Town & Country location on 20th St. That was not to happen...

I arrived early, just as they opened, since this location has a reputation for being very busy, and long waits to get in. By the time I left, 30 minutes later, the place was packed. Arriving when they open is apparently a sound strategy for getting seated.

I had so enjoyed my Pizza Margherita at the other location, that I was certain I would have a similar experience here. Even though the staff was busy with seating back to back arrivals at the front door, my seat at the bar proved to be a good idea as a server came to bring me water, and take my order almost immediately. 

The pizza offerings here were the same as at the Town & Country location, so once again I ordered the Pizza Margherita (tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil) with the addition of garlic and prosciutto, understanding that prosciutto would significantly increase the cost of my pizza. As at Town & Country, I was assured that additional ingredients would not interfere with the crust being thin and crisp. I considered ordering a glass of red wine, but my server never returned, or came within ""hailing"" distance.

My pizza was brought to me by a different server after a very short wait. It didn't look quite as perfect as my pizza from the Town & Country location because this pizza had many burned areas on the edges of the crust. Before trying it, I had to cut through the prosciutto, which was apparently added after the pizza was sliced.

My bite of the first slice was not quite what I had expected or hoped for. The crust was super thin, but not quite crisp at the center as it had been at Town & Country. It was also barely warm - not even close to hot. I wondered if once it came from the oven, it had to sit and wait for someone to have time to finish it with the prosciutto and basil. 

Finally reaching the edge of that first piece, it became clear to me that unlike at Town & Country, this WAS going to be one of those pizzas where part of the crust would be left on the plate - the burned part. I tried a bit of it, but it wasn't slightly charred, it was burned through on most of the edges. 

Since no one came back to check on how my pizza tasted (all attention was focused on the stream of incoming diners) I made my way through a couple more cool slices, eating less and less of each slice as the burned edge was increasingly large as I worked my way around the pizza. It had turned into a pretty poor experience.

As I looked up, I saw that my check had been left for me - no offer of dessert - nothing - just an apparent indication that I should pay and relinquish my check. I got my credit card out, and placed it with the check. When the server came to get the check, he did ask if I wanted a box - but I had NO interest in taking that pizza home with me. 

I would have preferred focus on the pizza preparation and service, rather than how quickly they can seat people as they walk in the door. The door seemed to be all that the staff was attentive to. This ended up being like a pizza cafeteria rather than a pizza dining experience. 

My experience at Pizzeria Bianco, the original at 623 Adams in Phoenix was a complete and very expensive bust. It was a complete waste of money for a poorly executed pizza, poor service, and poor value. I would not recommend it, and will not return. I will, however, be returning to their location at Town & Country again soon.

As an aside, looking at the photos on Yelp for both locations, I see more pictures of burned crust for 623 Adams than for Town and Country.",7,2,1

I don't get it.  

The food is ok, the service was great, but people waiting 2-3 hours on the weekends?  Why???

Thankfully, when I went (on an off-peak night), I only had to wait about 40 minutes, which is still a long time for me.  Patience is not my strong suit.  The wait staff was very curteous & helpful, but the food (which I was expecting to be orgasmic- I even brought an extra pair of boxers just in case) was just... sort of... ok to good.  Certainly not, ""I'll have what he's having"" worthy"".   Actually, it's probably for the best.  Girls can go on and do the whole O-face thing.  Guys can't.

We'd been warned about the wait, but at a distant glance it didn't seem to busy, so we went on with our night. When we returned, we were welcomed with a 1.5 hour wait which was our fault, really. Luckily the Science Museum, adjacent to Pizzeria Bianco, was open, and we filled that hour and a half quickly. As the time got closer for our wait to end, we went next door to the wine bar, which had a decent, but small, wine and beer list. Prices weren't bad either--beer started at $4, glasses of wine ran around $8-$9. 

I loved two things about Pizzeria Bianco: the food and the location. 

We opted to sit at the bar instead of waiting longer for a table. We shared (and finished all in one seating) a caprese salad (good, fresh, airy mozzarella), the margherita pizza, and the pizza rosa. I favored the margherita pizza, my fiance favored the pizza rosa. Both had good, chewy thin crust. The pizza rosa was a white pizza; I believe that only the margherita and marinara pizzas off of the menu have red sauce. Anyway, the pistachios on the pizza rosa were an EXCELLENT touch. 

Heritage Square is wonderful, especially at night. The layout and buildings are reminiscent of old New England architecture, which is a like a breath of fresh air in adobe-packed Arizona (which I love!). It's definitely a good place to stroll around (which you'll most likely have to do while you're waiting for your pizza :) ).

Next time I am in the area I will probably stop by and put my name on the list, go run some errands, get ready, etc then head over to the pizzeria. There is not a lot to do in the area for 3 hours, so be prepared. Right across from the restaurant is a small pub and right next door is a wine bar. Both are chill places, so grab a drink and socialize. 

The pizza is light and crispy, just how an Italian style pizza should be. We shared the Sonny Boy and Biancoverde pizzas, plus a Spiedini to start. Both were quite tasty. I enjoyed the open kitchen and the selection of bottled sodas. Make the wait at least one time while you are in Phoenix and decided for yourself.

I came here again when I was in town for the All-Star Game in July. The pizza is still great. I tried the Magherita with Prosciutto. It was really good. The best idea was to rush over here before the crowd at the game and enjoy pizza without waiting.",1,0,0

The 43-seat restaurant in Old Town Phoenix is nationally known and the crowds outside prove it. You will need to get there around 2:00 or 2:30 in the afternoon to line up for a seat or you may be left waiting until after 6:30pm for the second seating. Really. If you get there after 3:00pm, forget about being in the first group of patrons.

While you wait, Bar Bianco offers drinks and there are a few places to escape the hot Arizona sun. Most people are nice enough to let you back in line if you need to move, so bring a good attitude and make friends with your line-mates. It will help, believe me.

The pizza is crafted in a wood-fired oven which, legend has it, was delivered from Italy brick-by-brick and rebuilt on site. The meats offered are gourmet and can be a tad salty. The other toppings and the cheese are also high in quality. The oven creates a wonderfully caramelized crust that the uneducated might call ""burned."" However, that's their problem...the crust is perfect.

I prefer the Sonny Boy, which has Salami and Olives, or the standard Margherita. However, the handful of other pizzas are equally as good. You might want to order two and take what's left home versus finishing and needing to order another pie.

If you're there during baseball season, you can walk to Chase Field to catch a Diamondbacks game...and you can park in the garage in between the two locations.",1,0,1

Last night I got the Rosa and the Biancoverde. Both pizzas depended highly on the flavoring of the parmagiano reggiano. 

The Biancoverde is a great concept with variety in texture but pretty bland and tasteless.  Adding more ricotta cheese and an ingredient that has some taste would do wonders. 

The Rosa is basically eating Parmesan cheese on a piece of bread. They add red onions and some type of citric juice to relieve the tastebuds of realizing that you're eating too much cheese for too long. The pistachios are there for texture and to distract you from the fact that you're eating cheese on a piece of bread. 

If these pizzas were $10 range, fine. But they charge a whopping $16-$19 per small\/medium-sized pie.  Coming from Italy where I ate like a queen for no more than €10 per pie or meal, this is subpar and not worth the bucks.",1,0,0

This place doesn't disappoint in terms of crust--it is wood fired. Their red sauce is good, also. However, the parmesan is melted, and the mozerella is stringly. All the cheese is overdone. The menu choices are limiting---the combinations offered are Americanized. You'd do well here to make off menu requests, probably. The Sonny Boy would be better if the olives were sliced---the presentation of whole olives on the pie is luxe, but the bite, while delicious, is too overwhelming. The rocket (arugula) on the biancoverde was not baby rocket, and it was dull--a bit past its freshness date, and with no spicy zing. The cheese was overwhelming, and overall flavor was bland. Would not order it again. This place is in a good location and is priced high --and hyped up--for tourists, although many locals love this place. Our lunch bill for two pies, two salads, two peronis and one glass of house wine was $77, not including the tip.

Then we ordered waters, and they brought the kids tiny glass Pilsners filled to the brim with water and no lid. The floor is also hard surface. Toddler + water + glass + concrete floor = seriously?

Sonny Boy Pizza w\/ Sausage - Thin crust pizza. A little soggy at parts where I am guessing the sauce soaked in but there were parts that were nicely firm and thin. No complaints though because the flavor was wonderful. The tomato sauce was delicious. The fennel sausage completed the pizza. The cheese was melted and stringy when you took a bite. Yum!

Rosa w\/ Sausage - This was a different kind with no tomato sauce as the base. No sauce meant a firmer pizza with no sogginess whatsoever. The flavors were interesting on this but all went together well with every bite.

We went for a friend's birthday since we needed a special occasion to wait 2.5 hours for a table.  We were told we could wait at the bar next door (bar bianco).  It was great, pre-drinking is always a good time, but about 2 hours into the wait we went to check on our table and we were told we were taken off the list because we didn't check in every hour!  We were never told this was required!! Oh well, it added another half hour to our wait time...annoying but whatever.  3 hours of waiting.

Once we finally got seated, we were so excited from the anticipation that we were immediately let down by the service.  We told our server we were celebrating a birthday, and he said ""you and three other tables.""  Hmmm...well, ok, I guess you deal with special occasions a lot. 
I'll sum up the rest of the visit:  food was good, but I'm sorry, not great.  Service was average, no enthusiasm about a wine recommendation, and I guess they don't believe in water refills.

I think the only reason we got in is because they are now open for lunch. We were attending a matinee at the symphony and arrived 1.5 hours before and went to the restaurant, there was already a 45 minute wait. We put our names in and didn't get called before we had to leave to see the performance. We got out of the performance at 3:45 and decided to hustle back to Bianco and see if we could possibly get in before the dinner rush. We spoke to the hostess and she fit us in! Yay! 

The menu is minimal about five different pizzas, appetizers and salads. As we looked at the menu we decided to order everything we were curious about as we didn't know when we would ever make it back. So we ordered the Antipasto - wood fired veggies with big blocks of cheese, bright green olives and sopressata, served with bread and the most flavorful olive oil. The perfectly roasted veggies included sweet onion, red peppers and sweet potatoes it was wonderful! We also ordered three pizzas (for two adults and two kids - oh my) the margherita, wise guy and sonny boy. The pizzas were good. We enjoyed the pizzas with Peroni which is a perfect pairing. My favorite was the wise guy. Wood roasted onions and fennel sausage - just incredible. Everything was cooked perfectly. Our tab for three pizzas, antipasto, beers, and sodas came to $92. Pricey lunch but we ordered too much.
 
I think I felt slightly stressed during the meal as the service was speedy and I felt a bit rushed. Maybe it was my Catholic guilt rising up feeling like we bumped someone else from getting in earlier. It was a lovely meal, lovely building, but it was not relaxing. 

We took home an entire pie - a mixture of the three. Stuck it in the fridge and can you believe it actually tasted better the next day?? We warmed it in the oven and it was so delicious! 

I'm so happy we finally ate there - cross that one off my list. I don't feel compelled to drive all the way into Phoenix and wait in line for hours any time soon but I would do it again.

I've been to Bianco twice in my life. I consider this to be the Holy Grail of pizzas (in the US anyway). Paul Bianco is a master when it comes to crafting the perfect pizza pie. The crust is always perfectly cooked and flavorful. He only uses fresh ingredients, such as the basil which he grows himself in his own garden. Paul takes so much pride in his work that you will actually find him preparing each pizza and cooking them in his oven. When he pulls each pizza out, he looks like a proud father as he checks out his work.

I've read many articles including one from the NY Times proclaiming this to be the best pizza in the United States. In my opinion it is. But keep in mind that this is Italian style thin crust (sorry Sparkley) which is not for everyone. You will not find loads of toppings and a chewy crust like you will at find at Round Table. But what you will find is a pizza similar to what you would find back in the old country. 

Why take a star? Here is why. Pizzeria Bianco opens at 5:00, but do not even attempt to get here then because you will have absolutely no chance of being seated. Ok, how about getting in line at 4:30? Nope, wont happen. 4:00? You're willing to stand out in the hot Arizona sun for an hour for the best pizza ever right? fuggedabouti, it aint happening. If you do not arrive at least two hours before you will not be dining here. In fact, we have always arrived around 2:30 and still find a small line always forming out front.

On the bright side, there is a bar right next door (Bar Bianco) where you can sit and pass the time. But a member of your party still has to stand in line until 5 to put your name on the list. Once your name gets on the magical list, you are free to join your group and have a drink and they will come and get you.

No Jennifer L, no dessert is offered here. That too is kind of a bummer.

There are ten toppings you can add to jazz up your pizza.

Bianco's small plates are an antipasto selection and spiedini, which consists of ""Italian Fontina wrapped in Prosciutto di Parma, served warm."" Salads are the house salad w\/mixed greens going for $6 and the caprese carrying a hefty $9 price tag.

The dining room at Bianco is about 1\/65,245 the size of a dining room at the Cheesecake Factory, making it a far more intimate space. With hall ceilings and brick walls, Pizzeria Bianco feels as rustic as it looks. Although the dining room is small, your waiter has a lot of other customers to take care of, so don't expect star treatment. 

Containing the three colors in the Italian flag, the caprese is a plate of thick, watery slices of house-made mozzarella, large slices of ruby-red tomatoes, and bright leaves of basil. Olive oil and vinegar are perched in the middle of the table, so patrons can garnish their salad as they see fit. Although caprese is a summery dish, it was equally enjoyable in November.

My favorite pre-pizza dish was the spiedini. Atop mixed greens (not mentioned on the menu! yay for unexpected salad!) sit two skewers. Each skewer is poked through a chunk of fontina cheese, all of which is then wrapped up like a birthday present in prosciutto. Inside the slightly caramelized prosciutto hides softly melted cheese which oozes out upon being cut. The contrasts of temperature, texture, and flavor dance inside your mouth.

No matter which pie you order, the standout of the pizza will be the crust. Fired in a wood oven, every pizza is prepared individually by owner\/chef Chris Bianco. Like the bread served at the beginning of the meal, the pizza crust is incredibly delicious. A slight crunch on the crust gives way to a chewy center. Char marks freckle the ring of crust at the circumference as well as the bottom of the pizza.

The marinara, is the plainest pizza on the menu. The sauce overpowered the crust both in flavor and in texture, making an otherwise glorious crust into something floppy and flaccid. The addition of cheese and basil, as found on the margherita, makes a world of difference. Less sauce is used on this pizza, meaning the crust stays crisp and the flavors are allowed to complement each other in better proportions.

Gutsier choices on the menu include the Rosa and the Wiseguy. The Rosa, sans tomato sauce, is topped w\/red onion, parmigiano reggiano, rosemary, and Arizona pistachios. Although I've put walnuts on a pizza before (curry sauce + walnuts = whoa), I'd never thought to crumble up pistachios to use as a topping. The crushed nuts provide an earthy flavor as well as a fantastic contrast in texture. The combination of toppings makes for a light yet satisfying pie.

The Wiseguy, also without red sauce, comes topped w\/thick, wood-roasted rings of onion, house-smoked mozzarella, and fennel sausage. A hearty pie, the Wiseguy tastes mostly of the fennel-spiked sausage. It's easy to lose the smoky flavor of the cheese and the roasty flavor of the onion beneath the overpowering punch of fennel. Regardless, that sausage is really, really tasty.

During one visit, I combined the Rosa and the Wiseguy by ordering a Rosa topped w\/some of the fennel sausage ($3 extra as a topping). The sausage had the same effect on the Rosa as it had on the Wiseguy, basically wiping out any other flavors I would've tasted otherwise. So, while the fennel tasted good, it was impossible to distinguish the rosemary, cheese, or pistachio. Unless you can taste beyond the sausage, you'd be wise to leave it off your pizza.

These are no desserts at Pizzeria Bianco--unless you consider pizza a dessert, which I certainly do. There is a list of a couple dozen whites and reds, though, so oenophiles will be able to enjoy their pizza w\/a glass or a bottle of the good stuff.

But don't feel obligated to order a drink. Unlike those chain pizza restaurants, you don't have to get drunk first in order to enjoy the pizza.",6,0,9

We went in with high expectations, having heard all about a New York Times article saying that Pizzeria Bianco has the best pizza in the country. We left quite a bit less than amazed. 

The wine bar where we passed our time before being seated was charming, with a rustic theme suffusing the area. The wine selection was limited however, favoring reds over whites. I liked that their beer selection included a number of local breweries, but their selection was limited in that as well. For non-alcoholic selection they had Mexican Coke and Coke Light (Diet Coke) . Avoid the Coke LIght unless you like to be overwhelmed with Aspartame.

We eventually made our way to the main dining area, which strangely enough is smaller than the wine bar. We were helped quickly - you certainly cannot fault the service here, which was prompt and friendly. Then our pizza arrived.

I don't know what the opposite of synergy is, but the pizzas we ordered had it. They were less than the sum of their parts. We ordered the Wiseguy and the Sonny Boy. The Wiseguy is a white pizza (no tomato sauce) with smoked mozzarella, sausage, and smoked onion. The Sonny Boy is a standard pizza with salami, olives, mozzarella, and tomato sauce. 

The Sonny Boy's ingredients were lost in the melange of the pizza as a whole. There was no clarity of taste from the salami. It was more a texture than a taste, and the texture was leathery. The salami reminded me of prosciutto rather than salami: very thin and salty. But with the mozzarella and tomato sauce, the salty taste disappeared into a void. The salami also looked a tad raw, salmon pink in areas rather than red. 

The pizza was also somewhat small. I felt like I paid sixteen dollars for a ten dollar pizza. I could not help but wonder whether the writer of the famous New York Times article had ever eaten pizza before.  

The Wiseguy was not much better. Given that there were so many smoked ingredients on the pizza, the pizza did not taste smoky at all. It was an okay pizza. Certainly not bad, but also very certainly not the best in the country; not by a long shot. It is not the best pizza in Phoenix, or even the best pizza in the neighborhood. So far, that goes to Cibo. 

It is not a bad place at all. The crust is crispy as one would expect from a wood-fired oven, although I question the wisdom of placing said oven in the restaurant. Phoenix is hot enough without placing a colossal heat source a few feet away from the seating area. 

I think that having so many rave reviews actually enhanced our disappointment with the restaurant. We went in expecting to be blown away and left with some sort of existential malaise. 

I can recommend Pizzeria Bianco, but only with reservations. The pizza is  above average, but Phoenix abounds with mediocre restaurants so the bar is not very high. There are better Pizzerias in Phoenix; Cibo and Le Grande Orange come to mind immediately. LGO even uses many of the same ingredients as Pizzeria Bianco, but with far better effect. 

In essence:  don't believe the hype. Eat here if you want good pizza. Don't eat here if you want amazing, best in the country pizza.",3,0,0

The second person to open the door was outright angry that we were sitting on the chairs while we waited because ""they were stacked for a reason.""

This time, a friend was in town and wanted to go to the famous ""Pizzeria Bianco"" so we went at lunch to avoid the 2 hour wait.  To be very honest, the pizza just wasn't that good - over cooked & dry.  The salad was good & the bread was great, but we went for the pizza! 

There was no wait at lunch & the service was better. But I have to say that the pizza at Grazies & The Parlor are better. The incredible dough was always the best thing about the pizza at Biancos...but it was not very good this time. It's lost the chewiness and was more like a cracker.

The service was quick and attentive and left nothing to be desired.  The staff at Pizzeria Bianco operate like a well-oiled machine.

Due to the pricing - which is a few dollars more than what you would normally expect - we decided on the Margherita pizza and I selected a Peroni to wash it down.

Within a few minutes our pizza was delivered and we dug in.  Halfway into our meal, Chris Bianco wandered in through the back and I instantly became star-struck.  

I tried to snap a quick picture of him, but he caught me and instead of embarrassing me any further simply engaged us in a short, delightful conversation.  I informed him that this was our first time visiting and after explaining to him where we were from (Olympia\/Seattle, Washington) he proceeded to compliment the Pacific Northwest.

Since I am a fan of Chris Bianco, this made a huge impression on me.  I always try to aspire to greatness and am particularly attracted to people who are culinary rock stars.  Some can be arrogant, snobby, and disinterested, but Chris was none of these things.  The guy was completely laid-back, down-to-Earth, relaxed, friendly, humble, and had such a pleasant personality that put us at ease.  All of the qualities you would expect in an excellent entrepreneur and host.

Our pizza was also a pleasant surprise and actually exceeded my expectations.  Thin crust pizzas are difficult to cook evenly and are often burnt or too soft.  This margherita pizza was perfect.  It wasn't too soft or overcooked.

I have also noticed that some restaurants have a difficult time balancing various flavors and that many serve pizzas that overpower you with saltiness.  Somehow Pizzeria Bianco is able to balance the ingredients perfectly.  They blend the saltiness of the sauce with the mild rich and savoriness of the cheese and dough so that it pairs excellently. 

 The difference between their competitors is night and day due to the quality of their ingredients and professional expertise. 

Pizzeria Bianco is hands-down the best pizza restaurant in Arizona and quite possibly the entire West Coast.

Despite limited seating, I highly recommend Pizzeria Bianco for all types of pizza lovers.  Just try to arrive early (around 4:00 PM) if you don't want to wait for a table.",5,1,3

The only reason i gave the review 4 stars is because of the wait. Everytime I've been here there has been at least a 2hr wait. They only take reservations for parties of 6 or more, so you have to show, get your name on the list, and wait. Bar Bianco (an old house right next door that's been converted into a bar) definitely makes this wait go by faster, and has an equally great atmosphere as well.

What happens when it's a bad tomato season? Make the caprese salad with grilled peppers instead! Thank you for continuing to give me the required direct injection of fresh mozzarella that I crave. It's delicious.

So we just moved here from Portland and had eaten at the best wood fired pizza in the nation (see previous reviews if you're ever in the portland area).  

Pizzeria Bianco was recommended by a friend that owns a wood fired pizza oven, so we definitely were expecting the best.

The wait is everything everyone says it is... 1+ hours. We waited in the bar next door and I asked if they had a Rose wine and was told that they had one not on the menu. Now here is where it's both our faults.. I never asked the price and she never offered it.  I was a little shocked to say the least when I got the bill for $50, it was good but not that good.

We headed over and ordered our pizza.  We got the Fennel Sausage pizza and honestly it wasn't that good unfortunately.  The sausage wasn't crumbled and it didn't taste like fennel very much..

I read reviews that people waited hours for the pizza since the building only holds 40 something people, somehow on a Friday night at 7PM the wait was only 45 minutes.

(yes, like that), so I was prepared for disappointment, and I wasn't disappointed. I arrived at about 3pm on a Monday and didn't have to wait at all. There are tables outside but they don't let you eat there -- not really sure what the deal is there... I guess maybe when things are busy that's where people wait? Anyway, it was a nice enough day, I leashed the pup outside and grabbed a seat at the bar where I could keep an eye on him. 

Simple menu, with only a few options. I did the biancoverde (ricotta & arugula). It was excellent. You really can taste the difference when the best ingredients are used -- almost on par with my aunt's famous homemade version. Which I guess is a pretty amazing feat for a restaurant. Still, it was just pizza. In fairness, I'm not sure what I was expecting -- to somehow have my mind blown by how great it was or what. It definitely isn't worth making a trip just to eat here, but it's definitely a great stop if you live or find yourself in the area.",2,0,0

I've been coming to Phoenix for 10 years and always wanted to go but didn't want to have to wait. Finally my family decided to take the plunge and it was worth it. My biggest fear was that the pizza was hyped because most people traditionally do not have pizza cooked in a wood burning oven.  After waiting for an hour and half I was beginning to think that the hype was bigger than the restaurant itself. Wow, was I wrong. I had the Sonny Boy pizza with fresh cured salami and olives. The flavor was incredible. Mix it with the flavor of the crust and it was like a party in my mouth. My family had the margherita pizza and the sauce was simply spectacular. Best sauce ever!  Alton Brown once said that great pizza comes from the crust and Chris Bianco's recipe proves it. The flavor of the burning oak is easily imparted to it. Even though Chris is no longer handling day to day cooking chores I'm glad to see that his recipes are still being cooked the way he expects them to.",1,0,1

My trick is to get there around 4:15 (during months when the weather is nice), get in line, and send someone to the bar to grab drinks to make waiting in line a little bit more enjoyable.  Doors open at 5, you get in with the first seating and you're good to go.  Or, if you don't get in the first seating, you put your name on the list (maybe a 45-60 min wait) and you go find a table in the bar and order an appetizer.

My first trip to Bianco, I was wondering if I would be able to tell if it really was better than the rest.  (Please note, this was several years ago when I was early in my ""good pizza"" knowledge).  

For me, this pizza got better with every bite.  It went something like . . .

First bite:  Yeah, this is good.
Second bite:  Wow, I really like this sauce.
Third bite:  Man, these tomatoes are really fresh!
Fourth bite:  OK, I'm impressed, the sausage isn't greasy at all!

The Wiseguy and the Margarita are my favorites.  Oh, and I really love that arugula one.  Ok, they are all great.  They have a great antipasto platter too!

I understand that people are frustrated by the long wait and the small space.  What I don't understand are all of the demands or suggestions.  
""Bianco needs to do something about the long wait.""
""They need to serve us faster.""
""They need a bigger space.""
They need to do this . . .
They should really do that . . .

The way I see it, they really don't have to do anything!  It seems to me their business is running quite well as it is.  If they choose not to open up more tables, or get a bigger space, or whatever it is, at the risk of lowering the quality of the food, then I have to respect that.

Just my two cents.  Take it or leave it.",12,2,8

I understand parking is available elsewhere, but when you've travelled a distance to eat here and are hungry and have been anticipating this visit, you just want to eat.  So we used the valet. He made it clear to us as we got out that the  $5 was a parking fee and did not include any tip. And he works off of tips. We were in and out of the restaurant in under 40 minutes. Seems crazy to spend $50 (see number 2) and pay $5 for parking + tip for just over a half hour. 2) We had a party of 4. We ordered 2 pizzas and had water. Our bill,  with tip, was $50 and (as mentioned in number 1) we were in and out in under 40 minutes. I have no problem paying a premium price for amazing food,  but I want to leave satisfied.

While waiting for my flight to leave Phoenix, I stopped in at Pizzeria Bianco with my friend Renee. This pizzeria is a transplant right out of Italy with it's own wood oven right in the dining room. I love seeing pizzerias set up like that, it is just a lot of fun to watch them cook your pizza only a few feet from your table. 

Prior to chowing down on pizza I had to order my first recommended dish, the Spiedini, Italian fontina cheese wrapped in prosciutto. The wrapped cheese was then skewered and cooked to be served nice and warm. Probably better than the pizza, this dish may be the best thing I've eaten in Phoenix. The cheese was warm and creamy and the deliciously salty flavor was layered along side the crispy and salty sweet prosciutto. Often salt on salt is too much but this combo just worked perfectly and kept me coming back for more. If I hadn't already ordered my pizza I might have just went with a few more orders of the cheese and called it a day. It really was that good.

A few minutes after our appetizers, my pizza arrived. I broke my own rule and ordered a pizza without a red sauce because it was the other reccomended dish off my restaurant list. The Rosa pizza consisted of some of my favorite ingredients so I felt like it was ok to deviate from my norms. First it had a wonderful crust on which to build. Thin and crispy with a bubbly crust, but what would you expect from a super hot wood fire oven. The toppings started with cooked down red onions, and unlike Mr. Scott Conant, I love me some red onions. The bite of the onions was balanced out by the cheeses especially the fresh Parmesan. The last topping and by far the least likely on a pizza were the pistachio nuts. The great thing is that I love pistachios also! All of these ingredients mixed together on a pizza created a depth of flavor that made me happy to have taken the risk. I would definitely reccomend this pizza to people who want to stray from the norm but in the end the prosciutto wrapped fontina skewers significantly out shined the pizza.

Overall our meal at Pizzeria Bianco was a memorable one.  Not much I could complain about. The service was good, the ambiance was like most pizzerias and the food was on point. I could eat that appetizer every day, too bad I don't live nearby. Next time you are in town and want some quality pizza on the western side of the country, check out Pizzeria Bianco.

We went to Pizzeria Bianco a few months ago for lunch. It was a bit after the lunch rush, so we didn't have to wait but the restaurant was pretty full. 

The menu is a bit sparse but we figured that it was so good, they were concentrating on quality vs. quantity of menu offerings. We ordered the handmade buffalo mozzarella and basil caprese salad and a ""sonny boy"" pizza that had salami and gaeta olives. Bianco claims that they use local tomatoes and I'm not disputing that they do. However, we went in the height of the tomato season when heirlooms are at their peak and plentiful at the farmers market, yet they served us tasteless, limp tomatoes with a schmear of balsamic. I never salt my food but the mozzarella should have been brined when they made it as it had no flavor.  For a $9 appetizer, it simply was not up to par.

The pizza was also underwhelming. The crust was ok but the toppings were minimal and the cheese on top was barely cooked. I was sitting in the table at the far corner near the front of the restaurant and I kept seeing speckles of dust in the air. I made the mistake of looking up and I saw that the wooden beams in this restaurant have about an inch of dust on them that flaked down on me and my pizza during the course of my meal. I was kind of too grossed out to continue eating and I was actually too embarrassed for the restaurant to tell the wait staff who probably couldn't do anything about it anyway. 

Hopefully, they have done a deep cleaning of the restaurant in the last few months. Honestly, if you have ever looked at the dust that accumulates on your ceiling fan if you haven't cleaned it in awhile, it looked like that x 10. Our simple lunch was about $30.. Maybe they charged us an extra topping for the dust.",8,8,3

The hype started getting ridiculous so I tried to go one night and they had a 3 hour wait, even though they closed in about 30minutes. Heard they took reservations for parties of 6 or more, so we got a group together and called. Took 2 months to get a reservation- so annoying!!

Their staff isn't overly helpful, and it took forever for our server to finally get to our table. Once he did, he was knowledgeable and friendly and service was fast after that. 

We all ordered salads, mine was a house salad that was really good. Portion was just right, not too big or small. However, it was so good that once I was done I wanted more. I shared a margherita pizza with added mushrooms that was pretty good, but my friend let me try her Wise Guy pizza and that was amazing. 

Not sure I have the patience to wait as long as some people did, and maybe if I had I would not have enjoyed it so much. But saving time with a reservation was worth it, and I'll go back if I have some time to kill or want to pay a little more for pizza.",0,0,0

We ordered the Wiseguy and the Sonny Boy. The red sauced sonny boy was my personal favorite with salami and pickled olives. The meat was definitely exceptional. You can taste the quality of where that meat has been, and the olives were definitely not your run of the mill. Their sauce was a good balance: slightly sweet which is how i like it.

Or maybe I'm a genius that remembers everything anyone's ever told me.

We came here for lunch and waited about 10 minutes.  Whew, lucked out.  The pizzas looked pretty big so we ordered one pizza --- Wiseguy --- and the mozzarella, tomato and basil salad.  The waiter also made it a point to tell us that the Wiseguy  did not use a tomato based sauce.  Odd but we nodded and said that was fine.  The salad was great... but then again, how can you eff up a mozzarella, tomato and basil salad?  The pizza was also good but pretty underwhelming after all I'd heard about this place.  Then we started wondering if the greatness of Pizzeria Bianco was the tomato sauce especially since the waiter mentioned that the Wiseguy didn't use it.  We flagged down our waiter and asked if we could have some of the tomato sauce on the side.  Denied!

Sounds ridiculous, but we thought we should at least try this place once. And if we didn't like it, then at least we'd experience it.

We actually arrived almost an hour early because we weren't familiar with the area and thought we could walk around the area to find out that there's nothing around there to go. But on the other hand, we were first, FIRST in line. After 10 minutes into us waiting, a steady number of people started to come line up. By the time they opened there were at least 100 people behind us. While we were waiting, there was a blonde lady that was annoying. She kept walking in and out of the restaurant...possibly the owner. She had this attitude that she was better than everyone else, driving her Mercedes. Not cool. And while we were eating she was chatting up the servers and the chef. 

Also, they do make reservations of some kind because we were not the first to be seated. The restaurant was half way full before we were seated. While we waited for our waiter and food, I would watch the chef make the pizzas by hand and he seemed to be so happy. You can definitely tell he loved what he was making with a big smile on his face.

I had heard about this place from so many different people that I felt compelled to try it. It is situated nicely off to the side of the Science Center courtyard. Upon entering, you no longer feel like you are in Arizona. You have an overwhelming sense of walking into the neighborhood, Italian family owned pie shop. The building itself is quite small and does not seat very many people, but it gives you the cozy, comfortably crowded feel that so many New York pie shops deliver.

Now if you are lucky enough to get in right away then my hats off to you. More than not, you will have a wait time of 30 minutes or more. Lucky for the wine drinkers of this city, directly next door is Bianco's wine bar. It's a casually romantic set up in there. The wine list is more varied than I thought it would be (happily surprised) and the value is not bad either. The prices are not pretentiously overpriced which is refreshing in this town. I recommend the Scarpetta Barbera... those who know this wine, you know why... those who don't, you'll know why after you drink the bottle :)

Now, back to the food... pizza! The menu does have more than just pizza but honestly, why would you go to a pizza parlor for a salad? The varieties of pizza on Bianco's menu are quite impressive. There seems to be one for everybody: the meat lover, the vegetarian, the health nut or the pizza connoisseur. We ordered the Margarita pizza and the Proscuitto & Arugula pizza. And let me tell you... wow! The flavors were so great and the ingredients so fresh! I cannot believe between the two of us we went through all the pizza... we just could not help it I guess :)

The only reason I cannot give this place the full 5 stars was due to the wait staff. Unfortunately, she seemed to be insincere, inattentive and very caddy. Oh well, you cannot have it all I guess.

If you come on a weekday at 11am, you'll be seated almost immediately. Unless you really want to tell your friends about waiting in line for 3 hours to get pizza, then I highly suggest you come here for lunch instead of dinner. 

The best thing about this place is that you can split the pizzas in half when ordering. Half of the pizza was a ROSA, which comes with red onion, parmesan, rosemary and pistachios. The other half was marghertia, which was pretty basic with tomato Sauce, mozzarella, basil. I'm glad we did the half and half because I would not have enjoyed a full ROSA. The rosa was a pretty unique creation with the pistachios, but I know I would have been tired of it if I had to have more than 3 pieces. The marghertia, although simple, was a great complement to the rosa and was very fresh and flavorful. The pizza took me back to my days in Italy.....albeit my days in italy were only 2 months ago, I did have flashbacks of sitting by the Trevi Fountain looking out for gypsies while devouring my perfectly crafted pizza. 

Overall, my friend and I split a pizza so the whole meal was only $13. We were both full, but then again we are okay with eating small portions. We got our food within 8 minutes of ordering. We had plenty of attention from the staff and I liked the coziness of the atmosphere. I'm a sucker for brick establishments.

I would not suggest waiting anymore than 35 minutes to eat here, after 30 minutes of hunger you get grouchy and whatever you eat will taste delicious to you. And when you are super hungry, you tend to devour your food instead of tasting it. If you come here to devour, you won't appreciate the pizza as much. This pizza is meant to be savored and tasted.

So, on Saturday night (our second to last night in Phoenix\/Scottsdale), we arrive to Pizzeria Biano at 4:30 pm, only to be met with a line the length of the Great Wall of China.  Ok, a slight exaggeration, but what a line it was!  I ultimately lost count of the number of people, but it did hit about 100 with a few more people in front of me.  I later found out that people had started lining up at 2:45 p.m. just to get seated at 5:00 p.m. that evening!

At this point, I still had hope... but, I was concerned.  I mean, there was literally fear in my heart - to come all this way from Chicago, only to be met by the possibility of not being seated and turned away and the option of returning the next evening being quite literally, an impossibilty (closed on Sundays and Mondays)... I was terrified.

Promptly at 5:00 p.m. Bianco's doors opened (hear: heaven's bells at this point).  However, a young woman, walking along the line of people and obviously keeping count of everyone in line, at some point (not more than 2 yards in front me), suddenly stopped and announced that from that point back in the line, seatings would occur after 10:00 p.m.!  Ahhh... that would be 5 hours later!! 

Crap.  What does that mean for me?  Eat dinner elsewhere and return?  Hang around for dear life and hope things change?  Go next door and drink yourself silly with a few apps?  I wasn't prepared for this evolution.  A 2 hour wait was manageable; a 5 hour wait was unexpected at the very least and possibly brutal if you were rather hungry like me.  

But, I stood in line until I made my way to the front and gave the hostess the number in our party and my name - at which point, she advised that the wait would be 3 1\/2 to 4 hours long.  Well, to me, that was enough to give me hope :)  So, my companion and I settled in at the bar next door and began to relax.  A few glasses of wine and a cheese plate later... and having witnessed more than a few people summoned for their table, we were evetually called!  By this point, it was 8:15 pm - a time well under the 4 hours initially quoted!  I was ecstatic!!!

So, happily we walk next door where we were seated promptly.  We placed our order even more promptly - 3 pizzas for the 2 of us (having waited for so long, we needed to experiment as much as we could).  We ordered the Wiseguy (sausage and onions), the Rosa (I believe this is the  name; pistachios and red onions), and another which had ricotta and greens.  ALL WERE TOTALLY WONDERFUL!  Literally - the crust is probably the best I've ever had outside of Italy (chewy where needed in the finish, but crispy in the initial give; and the smell was so pure) - and we all know that a perfect crust is the basis for a wonderful pie.  As to the toppings, my fave was the Rosa, my companion's fave was the Wiseguy... but, we both agreed and have always agreed that toppings are just something that is relative and totally subjective - no one combination is right.  It's all about one's palette.  I can't testify as to any apps as we stuck only with what was relevant to us, but the salad on the table next to us looked fresh and enjoyable. 

Funny thing - we finished eating by 9:00 p.m.!  A 3 hour, 15 minute wait all for a 45 minute meal, which we really enjoyed.  We can't wait to return.  But we did learn something - bring a couple of friends, be prepared for a wait, prepare to take turns waiting in the line while the others drink at the bar and you're good to go.",7,1,5

Cons:

-$2 charge for parmesan. Really?
-Long wait during lunch crunch and dinner.
-Pizzas are amazing when great, and just good at other times. Not sure why there is a lack of consistency. Might be time of pie in oven.
-Don't get the pizza with the onions. Not tasty.
-Difficult parking. Valet only in their private lot, so look for street parking if available.

With all the accolades and hype, I even made a conscious effort to lower my expectations. After the ridiculous four hour wait, I was starving. This if anything should have given the pizza an advantage. Everything looked right: the vibe, brick oven, and service all suggested a great meal. We ordered the wiseguy, margherita, and biancoverde. Sitting there watching the pizza maker, I was wondering why he would never clear the ash from the oven. Now I only noticed this b\/c I had been seated in front of the oven at pizzeria mozza a couple of weeks ago and had seen them clear the oven every 15-20 minutes of the ash. Oh well, I assumed they knew better than me. After the first bite, all I could taste was ash. Ash and more ash just pervaded the slice. Don't get me wrong I love the taste of char my pizzas. But this was different; this was nasty burnt cigarette remains in each and every bite. And it was the same for all three pizzas. But this wasn't the only problem with the pie. The most important part of a pizza for me is the crust. But Bianco's crust was just not that interesting, neither in texture nor flavor. The center of the crust was limp and soggy after 5 minutes. The toppings were also subpar and unbalanced: Fennel sausage lacked the punch that I'm accustomed to from homemade sausage. The margherita had too little basil, while the biancoverde had way too much argula to the point where the bitterness overwhelmed all the ricotta and other cheeses. Without the ash issue, I could see this being decent pizza, but definitely not deserving of a journey or a 4 hour wait.

I waited for three hours at Sally's in New Haven one time so I guess this is only a little longer. Bianco is as good as any ""Neapolitan style"" pizza I've had in the US, but that's not to say that it's better than all the others. Bianco doesn't have that perfectly even char on the crust that a lot of places seem to be able to produce, but they've got more than enough char (maybe even a little too much). I think their pizza compares most closely to A16 than the other places I've tried (Settebello, Spaccanapoli, Tutta Bella, Una, Antica etc). The crust has great - really great - flavor, has a very good rise at the edge and is perfectly soft and chewy. The cheese is also perfect: it tastes great and melts without burning or breaking down. The basil and tomatoes tasted fresh and great. So really, no complaints other than the wait. It will be nice when the Neapolitan trend puts some more places like Bianco in Phoenix so this isn't the only option. It may be really difficult to make pizza this great faster than Bianco does, but other places seem to be able to pull it off so hopefully that will happen in Phoenix at some point too.",3,0,1

Yelp directed us towards Pizzeria Bianco and although I have no other pizza in Phoenix to compare it to, I'd recommend eating there.

We decided to try out two pizzas among the four of us: the margherita pizza and the biancoverde. The margherita pizza was delicious; just what I would expect from a quality pizza joint. The biancoverde on the other hand wasn't quite my cup of tea. There was a strong flavor in the pizza that threw me off, but I should mention that two of the others in the group loved it. I think I just wasn't a fan of one of the cheeses on it so I can't knock them for that. The only small quarrel I have overall is with the crust; it was a little too thin and crispy for preference, but that didn't take away from the tasty pizza experience.

First things first, you are going to wait no matter what time of day you go unless you are the first person in line when it opens (good luck with that).   In fact, I put my  name on the wait list, then went  to watch my beloved Dodgers playing the Dbacks at Chase Field for 6 innings, then walked back and we still waited another 30 minutes!   So naturally, the question to ask is ""was it worth the wait?""  To that I answer a resounding 100% yes!  What was impressive was that the owner Mr. Bianco was the only person who cooked every pizza ordered.  Of course he had wait staff, and he had people helping him in the kitchen, but when it came to actually placing toppings and placing the pizza in the brick oven, watching it cook and taking it out when it was ready to be served, it was all him.  I don't know if he still does this now as I heard he was cutting back for health reasons.  But back then, you talk about dedication to your craft and putting care and attention to each pizza personally, Mr. Bianco did it.  In fact, the kitchen was open for patrons to view so I actually watched him do this time and time again for every order.  It is a shame if he does not do this anymore as patrons going now are missing that TLC he provided to every pizza made which I believe makes the difference.   Getting to the pizza I had, it was freaking amazing, and I have had Tottono's NY, Lombardi's NY, Bronx Pizza in SD, and Gino's East in Chicago.   Thin crust is always a favorite for me and the crust consistency was amazing, crunchy, perfectly baked, and the toppings and sauce and cheese...well it makes my mouth water like a pavlovian dog just thinking about it now.   The dining atmosphere was also pleasant, brick themed building, seating was ample, but then again it probably felt that way because every seat was always taken.

Again, be prepared to wait, but I would suggest to do like what local Zonies do, bring some friends, some bottle of wine, find a picnic table outside and enjoy the hot AZ evenings.  (I don't know what you would do in the winter though) Or go and watch a baseball game at Chase Field (that stadium is niceee) to pass the time while waiting.    West coast pizza is well represented by this joint, but then again would you expect anything less from the Best Coast?",0,0,0

The pizza is classic Neopolitan and very good as they were one of the first ones to offer this style since 1994, so I give them great props for that.  There are just now so many others offering similar styled pizza with unique and more flavorful crust offerings.  If I hadn't been to so many other places (see my pizza list), I would probably give them 4 stars.

I came on a Tuesday night when there were no sporting events nearby, so it wasn't too crowded, which was nice.  The parking is a little strange as when you turn into the street directed by your GPS, it dead-ends into the park near the restaurant.  Fortunately they have a valet guy that will take your car for a reasonable cost of $3.

I tried the margherita pizza with sausage and it was flavorful, and the crust was nice and chewy.

First by letting me state that I have wanted to eat here for many years but I was under the impression that there was always a really long line so I put it off. I had high expectations. When I saw it on a list of the top 10 downtown Phoenix restaurants, I decided to try it for lunch. While the service was decent, I was overall disappointed with the food.

We got there a few minutes after opening so it wasn't busy. The fans were on and the A\/C even kicked on at one point before several customers requested for them to be turned off (we had a high of like 65).

We started off with some free bread that was cold and served with a large dish of oil with nothing else in it. I wish the bread had been warmed.

We ordered a market salad which was $9 and consisted of pieces of watermelon and grapefruit, shaved fennel and way too much juice from the fruits and (I think?) topped with parsley. Not sure why but the tastes just did not work for me. 

I ordered a green salad instead and got a very large pile of fresh greens tossed in a vinaigrette. While there were 3 olives, there was nothing else. I wish there had been a couple of other flavored incorporated.

We ordered two pizzas (Sonny Boy and Wiseguy) which people seemed to be ordering one per person. For $18 each, I expected them to be the best ever.

The white Wiseguy pizza had roasted onion and fennel sausage. It seemed rather bland to me.

The red Sonny Boy's best feature were the olives but I really felt the whole thing was disappointing. There was nothing special about any of the tastes to me and the prices seemed too high.

I definitely prefer Cibo, Grimaldis and Spinatos. I've been told that other locations tend to be ""better"" but that is obviously here say. I will probably never try it again.",5,1,0

We also got some delicious appetizers - cheese\/nuts plate, bowl of the largest yummiest olives I've ever had, and of course we paired all of them with lots of wine.  Finally our table was ready and we decided to go all out and the four of us ordered four pizzas and two salads.

No gloating. So yeah, prepare to wait. Or go off peak, say before 11:30 AM for lunch. The margherita pizza is the litmus test for me. The dough is instantly superior to any other pizza place. That makes a huge difference. Take that, the perfect cooking of the crust (the right texture, char, crispy, chewy, sweet, and salty) and add supremely simple but fresh ingredients, and there you have it. Perfection. Enjoy.

A Wednesday night we arrived at 4:30 and got on the back of the line. The doors opened promptly at 5pm, when we got to the hostess we were told an hour and 20 minute wait. I hate waiting, I make reservations for everything to avoid waiting, but since we had a delicious late lunch which I'll save that for another review, we didn't mind the wait so much. We headed over to the wine bar and waited with a couple of glasses. After close to 1.5 hours our table was ready. 

The place holds about 40 people. After reading all the reviews we had to try the Spiedini which is Italian Fontina wrapped in Prosciutto di Parma, served warm and on a stick. Salty and creamy, it was very yummy. The bread they serve is excellent. Thick crusty crust and tender chewy on the inside. Not that you need bread before pizza, but after all the waiting how could you not have a piece, especially when it smells so good. 

Pizza we had to try the Bianco Verde; Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula. I am not a fan of Parmigiano, so it was a bit too much for me, but overall it was a good pizza. We also had the Wiseguy; Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage. This pizza was more my style. It was delicious, the sweet onions paired with the smokey mozzarella and sausage was almost perfect. The crust on both pies is pretty amazing, it has the same chewiness and spring that the bread had.

My girlfriend loves to cook, and always keeps up to date on the nearby restaurants that get rave reviews and\/or have staked their claim in the culinary industry. Naturally, she had this place on her radar for a while. Pizzeria Bianco has been called the best pizzeria in the country by such people as Rachel Ray and many others who have even eaten at pizza powerhouses like New York or Chicago. I have never eaten pizza in either of those cities, and yet I even had a hard time imagining that a pizzeria in Phoenix could be better than what they have out there. That is the collective theory, however, and people flock from all over to eat here. Like I said, I can see why it gets rave reviews from a culinary standpoint, but I really didn't find the pizza to be worthy of being called ""best in the country.""

As with last time, my favorite pizza was the biancoverde.  Both times I ordered it with prosciutto as an extra topping.  As I recall, last time they had baked the pizza without the arugula and prosciutto until it was almost done, then taken it out to add the prosciutto and arugula and cooked it for another mintue or so.  This time they reversed the order for the final two toppings, adding the arugula and then the prosciutto.  The consequence was that the arugula was under the prosciutto and stayed pretty wet.

Pizzeria Bianco was voted #1 pizza in America.  Being NY pizza die-hards, a few of my friends and I decided to check it out while visiting a friend in Arizona.

We had expected a wait but never expected it to be 3+ hours!   We waited about an hour to put our name on the list and they said it was going to be a couple of hours.  Rather than hanging around, we decided to make use of the time shopping nearby.  We called back after an hour and they said to check in again an hour later.  We checked in again and they said we should come back to the Pizzeria.  After we got back, we hung out at the quaint wine bar next door and waited some more. 

After what seemed like an eternity, we finally got seated.  We shared 3 pies -- the wiseguy fennel sausage, margherita and bianco verde.  It may be because we were famished beyond hunger by then but the pizza was very good.  The ingredients were fresh and the pies were piping hot.  

We decided to get 2 more pies to go...to justify the long wait.  :)

I've never waited so long for food and doubt I will do it again even though it was good.

The rest of us don't want to hear you whine. The fact that there are long waits is not a secret. I arrived an hour early and watched the line get to 100+ by 4:20 (they open at 5). Plan ahead - don't go when you're starving.

Only my trip to Di Fara in Brooklyn compares to Bianco experience-wise. That is to say that you go to a place with a humongous reputation and wait and wait and wait - but you don't mind the waiting. Instead, you take advantage of the fact that surrounding you are people who are there for pizza. They love pizza, too! You strike up conversations with people who are there for the first time or who go there every week. You hear about pizzerias from around the country (and sometimes globe). In the case of Bianco, you probably get to do some of this waiting in the sun or with a delicious beer from the bar in your hand. Visiting these spots is a celebration in pizza that's going to feel like a worthy experience for any pizza head.

Of course, none of it matters if the pizza doesn't make your taste buds sing. I am happy to report that mine are still singing Bianco's praises a couple weeks later. The crust is fluffy, chewy, light and flavorful. The toppings are of the finest available quality and often prepared in-house. The combinations are original and classic all at once.

Everyone else wussed out claiming excess work and meetings and blah blah blah. Anyway, we arrived at 5:45 PM and the restaurant was packed. It was a 2 hour wait and since we never ever get the chance to eat out anymore, we stuck it out. Ms. C and I sat in the lawn chairs underneath a romantic string of Christmas lights and shared a bottle of Pinot Noir ($36) which was soft, round, and lovely. K had a beer. 

90 minutes later we were starving and shared a cheese panini appetizer.  At exactly 7:50 PM we were seated at our table. After a bottle of wine, Ms. C and I were feeling rather swell. We looked at the wine list and debated about which glass of wine to get. Then we laughed and said ""screw it"" let's just have another bottle!  This time it was the Cabernet Sauvignon. I had an early early morning flight the next day, and believe me I wasn't looking so good in PHX Terminal 4 at 8 AM. 

I think it's  a trick that Bianco has--get you liquored up and relaxed so that a meal that really should cost only $50 for 3 people, ended up being $120. Haha...he really got us!  We got 2 salads: the Mozzarella and the Farmers Market salad. Both were satisfying. The FM salad was interesting with arugula and pomegranates.

Well, most of the reviews say that the wait is several hours long, which used to be true. In fact, several years ago, I actually waited for about an hour and a half. However, just recently, we walked through Heritage Square on the way to the ballpark. It was 6:30 PM on a Friday night and there was no way we ever would have imagined there would be room for us to dine. However, when we walked by, we noticed two spots at the bar. Could it be? We walked inside and yes, it was actually true! There were two seats at the bar just waiting for us. We couldn't have planned it if we tried, yet there we were sitting down on a Friday night at Pizzeria Bianco without a wait. I think this happened because Pizzeria Bianco has been open for lunch for awhile now and there isn't the excitement of waiting in line for them to open the doors at 5:30 PM. Whatever the case is, I think it's important to note that you might not have to wait for the two hours anymore...I think it all depends on the night. 

Food wise, I will second what so many of these reviews say. I really, really like the pizza here and the Margarita pizza is a number one best seller for a reason. It has this buttery taste of perfection with every simple bite. The salad was so fresh I thought something was off, until I realized that I just hadn't ever had such fresh lettuce before! I wouldn't wait for two hours to eat here, but if there's room to sit without a wait, then I will definitely eat here again in the future.",17,7,10

On this occasion I must have hit a sweet spot, because at 7 PM on a Tuesday night the place was  1\/2 full and the bar seating was empty. I waked in and was worried it was closed. Thankfully it was not, just a lull between the storms of guests I guess. By the time I left an hour later it was packed and people were waiting for a seat.

In any event I started out with an organic salad topped with blue cheese, bacon and house made croutons with a light vinaigrette. It was incredibly fresh, tasty and yummy and got my tummy yearning for my pizza. Sure I could have dined on pizza alone, but hey I need my greens and vegetables.

Secondly I had the ever popular ""wiseguy"" pizza. All their pizza's come in one size and can easily be shared with your best buddy, if you like to share. Or like in my case take half home and eat it for breakfast in the morning. The ""wiseguy"" is a very simple yes incredibly delicious white pizza, with fennel sausage, caramelized onions and very thinly sliced fresh mozzarella. Because the crust is so thin it stays supper crisp and the ingredients get to shine. It's hard to describe why this pizza is so so good, but it just is. I think between getting a pizza with only three toppings on homemade fresh dough, made the way it is in New York has a lot to do with it. The cheese just adheres to the dough and creates this cheese skin that the other topping just stick to. Add that to the char that the wood fired oven creates on the dough, and you have pizza perfection. Plain and simple.",0,0,0

However, the pizza is absolutely amazing. So, we went back a second time, just me and my husband. Our experience was much more delightful.

Unfortunately it was raining and I was not in the mood to drink for 2+hrs before dinner (those who were had a great time next door, some had cards to play etc, though I wonder if they tasted the pizza...). Had we known, we would have brought reading material or a DVD player and sat in the car, but no such luck. Fortunately it didn't rain the whole time - we wouldn't have lasted if it had. 

Now for the food. Obviously wonderful\/delicious. Easily the best pizza crust I've ever had - perfect combination of crispy and chewy, perfect wood fired taste and nice and light. The toppings were great too (though the sardines were a touch overwhelming - I wouldn't do those again). The antipasto was fantastic also. 
But I have to say, if this is a 10 (pretty close), there really are a few 8s and 9s that don't require 3hrs of waiting. In my mind the ""marginal utility"" of the uptick in quality, just isn't worth it. I mean if the choice was Pizza Bianco or Domino's, then of course yes. But there's Lombardis in NY, Delfina and A16 in SF - all of which are 8.5s or 9s in my opinion. We had lunch at Scottsdale's Olive & Ivy and their flat bread was a solid 7. 

So basically in my mind, not worth it. But there are obviously minions who disagree. I just wonder if there's some attraction to THE WAIT for some. I think there must be - not for me though. But I will say that if the wait were an hour - I'd feel very differently. It is incredibly delicious. But 3hrs is too much.",0,0,0

The main reason I tagged along with my hubby on his business trip to Phoenix was to make a pilgrimage to this pizza mecca -- and despite the mind-boggling lines in front of this joint, I can happily report that the 1.5 hours we spent waiting in the sizzling Phoenix sun wait was well worth it.

After checking out all the reviews and reports on the epic waiting times here (reservations are only taken exactly 30 days in advance for parties of 6 or more at 5:00 pm, 6:30 pm, and 8:00 pm), we knew that we would have to camp out hours ahead to get a table at their first seating at 5:00 pm.  After eating some delicious sandwiches at Pane Bianco, we drove here at 2:00 pm and started scoping out the spot.  Seeing no one, we popped in and out of the air-conditioned museum next door until we spotted two parties already in line at 3:30 pm.  We quickly ran and took our spots for the long wait in the desert sun.  There was a Diamondbacks game letting out, so the place was soon packed with other hungry and sweaty pizza aficionados.

Since we had so much time to chitchat with the other people in line, a regular let us in on his favorite items.  I was so fricking hungry and hot but everyone kept on assuring me that my patience would pay off.  How the hell do people wait for a table in the summer?

Once we made it inside, we decided to order a ton.  We got the antipasto plate, Farmer's Market Salad special of the day (grapefruit with shaved fennel and parsley), and three pies (Margherita, Rosa, and Wiseguy).  The antipasto was delicious - the veggies were farm-fresh and beautifully carmelized in the wood burning oven, and the soppressata and cheese perfectly balanced them out.  My favorite part of the platter was the cannellini beans which was nicely oven-charred.  This dish contrasted well with the juicy tang of the grapefruit salad.  I was already getting full but knew that I had to grow another stomach for the main event to come.

Man, our pizzas were revelatory.  The crusts were perfect -- each had a chewy, blistered edge and a crispy, paper-thin middle.  The Margherita was the best I've eaten - period.  The Wiseguy had such a delicious smokiness from the hand-cured fennel sausage, house-smoked mozzarella, and wood roasted onions.  Mmmmm mmmmm.  My favorite pie was the Rosa.  Who knew that a pizza topped with red onion, parmigiano reggiano, pistachios, and a sprinking of fresh rosemary could taste so yummy?  

We left stuffed, satisfied, and happily lugging a box of leftover pizza back to our hotel.  I am already planning our next trip back to Phoenix just for the pizza -- I kid you not.",6,2,4

The pizza is nice.   The crust has that yummy woodfired taste with a little bit of charring that I really like.  The ingredients are fresh and tasty.  The items on the menu are creative yet traditional.  This just isn't my thing.

There are lots of things to like about Bianco's.  I love that he has stayed small.  I appreciate that.  I love the cute bar next door to provide some solace to the excruciatingly long wait.  I love the area it's in.  Absolutely beautiful.  I love that Bianco's is real.  Real ingredients, real cooking.

Yes, this may be a bit of a rant, so in an attempt to be balanced, let me offer a little perspective.

Pizzeria Bianco was one of the first places that I ate at when I moved to Phoenix earlier this year. The food is very good. The service is good, but I was immediately aware that the business model is very flawed, in that I have never waited for less than 90 minutes for a table. It is true that you can pass the time quickly in the adjacent wine bar, and I have done so on many occasions. The wine selection is above average, and the environment is pleasant.

However, the business manager (owner Chris Bianco's ex-wife) is a truly miserable human being (ask any of her employees), and her imprint on the approach to customer service at the restaurant is unmistakable. The management believes that there is absolutely no incentive to provide anything resembling an enjoyable experience for their patrons because there are unlimited numbers of people who will wait upwards of 4 hours for their signature wood-fired pizzas.

As a fan of excellent food, I do appreciate their attention to detail and excellent craft. But the consistent manner in which I see loyal customers disrespected and outright abused is completely unacceptable.

While I do love their pizza and antipasto (which is not, irreplaceable I might add), after many months of consistent patronage, I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone.",34,3,4

No way should this pizza be considered one of the nation's best. There are way too many wood-fired Neopolitan-style Pizzeria's out there out-performing this one.

Margherita ok but needs more evo and basil.

Wiseguy was ok but a bit cheesy, heavy, dry, but onions tasty. Sausage so so. 

Had a Marinara with added olives and chovies. Olives just kind of thrown in there and mostly centered on a couple peices rather than spread out (not much care). Chovies were fishy, even for chovies (but not salty).  So Not worth the price of these extra ingredients ($3 for olives; $5 for chovies) olives weren't even anything that special taste wise. 

Overall, good but not great, not much cornicione, crust kinda flat dry and crunchy. I like a puffier more crumb filled crust (even for this style). Some of the edges were way too hard and crispy and inedible. Out of 4 pizzas some were much more scorched than others (inconsistent).

Green salad ($6) was just some lettuce  greens and 5 green olives- nothing else, kind of a rip off really.",1,0,0

Prepared for the wait, and prepared to be unimpressed, but feeling obligated to write a good review because of six degrees of separation.

It's been two years since I've lived in Phoenix and while I was there I never got the chance to eat at this uber-famous world renowned pizzeria that has been featured on Oprah, Martha Stewart, and in Bon Appetit as the best pizza in America.  Not that I didn't want to, I just never got the opportunity to go.  Well, During a mini-vacation to the city of the sun this weekend, I had one thing in mind, and that was to wait the 4 hrs and eat some pizza lovingly made by none other than Chris Bianco himself.

Let me just say this....The Hype?  Believe it!!!  And, it totally is worth the wait.  

I have heard stories of loooooooooong lines waiting to get into Pizzeria Bianco.  Stories of lines 4 hours long are not uncommon, and it sounds really dreadful to wait in a line that long.  What does a great businessman do?  He opens a wine bar right next door, cleans up the lot, takes names, establishes a system to let people roam free while they wait, and plies them with wine.  Happy people, problem solved.  Disneyland could learn a lesson or two from the man.

Once you get seated, the waiting is pretty much officially over, you sit, you order, you get food.  And I can not properly describe the glory of this food.  It is the best pizza I have had, ever.  Let me tell you this...I had a slice of pizza in my claw when I came out of the womb.  I've been eating pizza for 41 years!

There were 4 of us, and we ordered the prosciutto wrapped fontina (sublime) and the anti pasta salad, warm, salty, fresh, crazy unique, and  perfect for 4 to share.

We each ordered 1 pizza:
1 Margarita
1 Wiseguy
1 Biancoverde
1 Sonny boy

The pizza cant be described in words.  Chris Bianco brings pizza to a new level.  The combination of flavors is so exquisite,  that no other pizza in the country can compare.  The crust was crunchy and chewy, and I even saw some coming out of the hearth on fire!  You have to experience it yourself, and then once you do, you will know.  Read the menu on the link above to get the idea.

We ended up taking a slice of each home, but that was only because we were obliged to, otherwise there would have been none left.   I had a cappuccino for dessert, and it ended the already perfect experience on a celestial note.

I encourage one and all to go to Pizzeria Bianco if you are ever in Phoenix, but make sure you call me before you go, I don't want to wait any longer than I have to.",10,5,10

Not a problem. We were seated immediately and there were tables to spare. We both ordered coke lights (apparently the Italian version of diet coke) and they came in the adorable classic glass bottles and were very tasty. We asked our server if we could only order one pizza which one he would suggest. He told us the Biancoverde with added prosciutto was the one to get, so we went for it. NO REGRETS. This pizza was tasty. Thin crust and oh so flavorful, the ricotta and cheese were amazing, and the prosciutto was yummy, not overly salty like some can be.

Pizzeria Bianco is one of the country's most celebrated restaurants for pizza.  It won a James Beard award long before many of the Italian style pizzerias featuring high quality, fresh ingredients started popping up in major cities across the country.  This Pizzeria Bianco (there is another location in the Phoenix area) is in Downtown Phoenix and is located just a few blocks away from the city's major sports venues like Chase Field.

Pizzeria Bianco has a great exterior with its historical looking brick structure.  The inside dining room is fairly small, but it is vibrant and comfortable and showcases a wood burning oven behind the bar.

In addition to their signature pizzas, Pizzeria Bianco's menu features a small selection of starters and salads.  Pizzeria Bianco's antipasto plate offers a variety of wood roasted vegetables, sopressata and a hard Italian cheese.  I did not really care much for the vegetables.  I felt they were a tad soggy and the broccoli was oddly sweet.  Zucchini and peppers were some of the other vegetables on the plate.

I really liked the sopressata though.  It was not just a standard salty cured meat.  It had a good salty note, but it also had a bit of spiciness.  The sopressata was also perfectly thin and moist; it combined with the dry cheese and their baguette to make for a great bite.  Prosciutto wrapped figs were also on the antipasto plate.

I tried a variety of their pizzas.  My favorite would be their margherita.  All of the ingredients were good.  There was a good tomato sauce, nicely melted mozzarella (the right amount too) and fragrant basil.  I did feel those same ingredients shined more at Los Angeles Italian pizzerias like Pizzeria Mozza and Milo & Olive.  I also felt the crust at Pizzeria Bianco was a tad bland.  The crust at Pizzeria Bianco though was uniformly thin and crispy.

I also had their margherita pizza and added prosciutto and arugula.  This was a good pizza though the prosciutto at Pizzera Mozza has a much more delicious flavor as well as a more satisfying thin and soft texture.  Their Wiseguy pizza with fennel sausage, roasted onion and smoked mozzarella was okay though I personally have never been a fan of pizzas without tomato sauce.

Service was quick and pleasant.

Prices are okay.  Given that Pizzeria Bianco is a pizzeria, you are obviously going to be able to dine here at a much lower cost than other highly celebrated Phoenix restaurants, which tend to be more upscale and feature fine dining prices.  Pizzeria Bianco is priced similarly to most Los Angeles Italian pizzerias though it offers more reasonable prices than Pizzeria Mozza.

Pizzeria Bianco is a good option for Italian style pizza though I have enjoyed other places more for Italian style pizza like Los Angeles' Pizzeria Mozza and Milo & Olive and Minneapolis' Pizzeria Lola; while Pizzeria Lola does not have the great crust of Pizzeria Bianco, I felt the toppings, sauce and cheese at Pizzeria Lola were all more delicious.  I also thought my recent trip to Los Angeles' order-at-the-counter Pitfire put out a more satisfying pizza.

Still, Pizzeria Bianco has a lot of history and it has inspired many pizzerias across the country including Pizzeria Mozza.  Given Pizzeria Bianco's similarities to many other Italian style pizzerias found in major metros like Los Angeles and San Francisco, it might not be the best choice if you are only in Phoenix for a night or two.  But if you can try some food that is more unique to Phoenix and still have a few lunch or dinner slots open, Pizzeria Bianco is worth a visit.

I am not sure what the parking situation is in Downtown Phoenix, but it looks like parking would be easier to find here than downtown areas in other bigger cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco.  Pizzeria Bianco also offers valet parking.",14,9,12

The wait staff has always been very pleasant, perhaps because I catch them early in the evening, perhaps not.  Either way, the food is the star here.  Perhaps the pizza is not for everyone, but just about everyone.  The pizza comes out blistered from the searing oven dripping with flavors I didn't know could come from a pizza.  In fact, I was living in Chicago the first time I had it and it ruined all other pizza for me.  Recently, a place 1.5 hours away from Chicago that was an admitted copy of Bianco was named one of the top 5 pizzas IN Chicago.  It's not even close to Chicago but it was good enough to rate that high.  Enough said in my mind.

We had a wonderful experience at the bar; the bartender was very friendly, the ambiance is nice, and the wine and beer were tasty.  Around 5 I walked next door to the pizzeria and told the manager I needed seating for 2, she said it would be around 30 minutes and she put me down on the waiting list, I told her I would be next door.  About 30 minutes went by and another employee from the restaurant came over to see who was waiting for a table.  I informed her we had put our name in about 30 minutes prior, she said she would check and get back to me.  Another ten minutes passed and I ended up walking over to find out what the hold up was.  I again spoke with the manager whom acted as if I was bothering her and in a condescending tone she told me my name was on the list and she would let me know when something became available.  Meanwhile there were at least 6 open seats at the bar and 3 empty tables inside.  I went back to the bar and waited another 10 minutes before returning to the restaurant.

The manager told me there was still a wait of about 5 minutes, I expressed to her that we had been waiting for at least 50 minutes at this point and while we wanted to sit inside, I asked her if we could sit outside.  She said we could and told me the bartender was supposed to offer us that option.

I'm a Phoenix resident, and I too had heard the buzz about Pizzeria Bianco.  I regularly dine in the area, and I'm familiar with what the Valley has to offer for pizza fare.  First of all, my date and I arrived early so we didn't have to wait --  we lucked out and got a table right away.  Unfortunately, the waiter asked us if we knew what we wanted to drink.  We asked to look at the wine list. About 30 seconds later, another waiter asked what we wanted to drink before we decided. Still again, 30 seconds later the original waiter came back and asked if we had decided what to eat now.  We ordered the wine at that point.

We settled on the Margherita Pizza and the Wiseguy.  We wanted to get mushrooms on the side, but apparently they are only available on a pizza.  We opted not to put them on a pizza so we could taste each one as they were intended to be eaten.

The Margherita had too much cheese to be a classic Margherita Pizza in my opinion.  The sauce saved it, which seemed fairly suffused with basil. Still, for ""the best pizza in the country"" - I have definitely had better.

The Wiseguy was atrociously bad.  Let me pause for a minute to point out that this is 1 out of 6 of their only pizzas -- one of which is a ""marinara"" pizza, a.k.a bread with sauce.  Speaking of which, we noticed they were filling giant bins with what looked like delicious baguettes, but they are apparently for their other Bianco business because they were not on the menu and were not offered to guests.  Back to the Wiseass -- I mean  Wiseguy.  The wood smoking of the mozzarella only made it less appealing.  The pizza is a  Frisbee of cheese with a pile of greasy onions on top.  The Italian sausage was bland, and barely noticeable under all of the onion. It tasted like a bad take on a Philly cheese-steak, or like I was eating a pound of sauteed onions right out of the pan.

Sometime about halfway through our meal, I noticed a new party who had sat down next to us received their pies.  When they spied their Wiseguy, a look somewhere between grimace and forced smile crossed each of their faces.  I looked around the rest of the restaurant and realized it was filled with similarly dissatisfied patrons.

Yes my expectations were set high from the glowing reviews. But I wouldn't have recommended a visit here if I had randomly walked in off the street.  I have an open mind and enjoy almost any culinary creation, so I can definitively tell you that this menu was simply a miss-fire.  Look elsewhere.",4,2,1

Antipasto:  Your typical fare of vegetables, cheese, and meats.  I enjoyed the squash and prosciutto-wrapped figs.  Yum!

Spiedini:  With bites of spinach to cut through the saltiness of the rich fontina cheese and prosciutto, it was almost a perfect bite.  

I won't drone on about every single pizza but I will say that the Rosa was my favorite.  The Rosa pizza is just a flavor-explosion.  I love how the pistachios adds an interesting texture and who doesn't love rosemary?  Delish.

Never would have thought I would like pistachios on a pizza but the crunchy texture of the nuts mixed so well with the parmesan and onions. It was unlike any pizza I have ever tasted before. Keep in mind this is a white pizza, which I prefer anyway. The crust is thin and provides a perfect stage for the ingredients. I liked this place also because everything is out in the open.

Claims such as 'best in US', as this place's been tagged by many, is in the mouth of the beholder. 

Since this was (relatively) close to wife & I's recent trip to the Grand Canyon, thought we'd stop by and check it out. 

Taking advice of other Yelpers, we got there at 4pm to make the wait 'only' a hour. Sitting in 107 degree heat is no fun, but the anticipation and sips of IPA from bar next door made it tolerable. 

It's located in a nice courtyard in downtown, with parking structure nearby. 

Doors finally open and we were seated in a small yet clean and functional dining area with open kitchen and Italian pizza oven as the centerpiece. 

We scanned the menu and quickly decide on antipasto plate, Rosa and Wiseguy pizzas. 

Antipasto was really good, very sweet, flavorful veggies and savory pieces of sopressata and cheese. 

Now finally the pizza. We had high expectations with all the hype, and it met them, which does not happen often. Crust is the foundation for great pizza, and this was a grand slam, thin but not too thin, crisp and slightly charred and smoky on the outside, chewy, yeasty, moist, and delicate at the same time. Quality, delicious and unique topping combos that work together, parm and pistachios, and smoked mozz and fennel sausage in our case. We both agreed that overall it's the best overall pizza either of us ever had to date, better than in Italy. Even though our(her) gut was about to burst, we wanted more! I'm still thinking about it. 

Staff is courteous and service was efficient. I highly recommend a bottle of local brown ale while wolfing down slices, tasty brew even though it's not on tap.

This restaurant has created a wonderful way to enjoy your meal, something that is truly (and sadly) unique in Phoenix.  The long wait becomes an opportunity to relax - to slow down, and sip wine in a charming cottage, on a grass lawn, surrounded by historic brick houses, in the shadow of the modernist science center.

The wine and beer list is well-curated, the staff is attentive, and the carefree pace continues throughout the night.  Once seated, you are served in an environment that is casual but respectful.  Last time I went, the couple at the table next to us got their check 15 minutes after we sat down - and they were still there when we left.

The food isn't always impeccable - and where else is it, at $12-15 a person?  But the ingredients are always fresh, the dough is delicious even when soggy, and the atmosphere cannot be beat.

Honestly, it's something people don't talk about enough.  This is a place that is heralded as (at least one of) the best pizza places in the country, and a schlub like me can afford to take my beautiful wife.  We can both enjoy a glass of wine, a night under the stars, and delicious pizza for under $50.

However, the outer rim of my pizza was pretty badly burnt and tasted awful. And the salami on the Sonny Boy is INCREDIBLY salty (yes, I know it's salami...but geez). I'd advise you to customize your own pizza when you finally get a seat and not go with the suggested combos. But enough about the food...

An hour and twenty minutes to get a seat by myself at the bar? On a Tuesday night? No way that was worth it.

This alone, was fascinating to watch. And after waiting a good four hours to try it, the people who accompanied me claimed that it wasn't worth the wait - dismissing it as a victim of overhype. I, on the other hand, strongly disagreed with their sentiments. And almost a decade later, my opinion remains unchanged.

What's interesting about Pizzeria Bianco is that, I didn't go here once and quickly declare it to be the best pizza I've ever tried. That status came after eating it repeatedly, becoming accustomed to its flavor, and then comparing it against - well, pretty much everyone else. And my conclusion has remained the same: Few have come close, but I've yet to find anyone else that can produce a pizza that tastes like this. 

To this day, I still see the common complaints. It's burnt! It's too thin and floppy! There's not enough cheese! Why isn't there any ranch to dip my crust in? How come there isn't a barbeque chicken option?  

Okay, so this pizza isn't for everyone. It's not Americanized corporate pizza and it's certainly not Neopolitan pizza. In fact, I'm not entirely sure what you'd call it.

Their blistering crust is key here. There's a satisfying crunch to the outer shell, despite having an interior that's soft, airy, and filled with flavor. On a really good day, when eaten fresh from the oven, the crust will damn-near melt in your mouth on the first bite. They're pretty open about their sources and methods, but I'm still convinced there are some secrets they won't reveal.

Since I originally reviewed the Town and Country location, I decided I'd do something a little different and break down their pizzas pie-by-pie.

Your six options are as follows:

Margherita - Let's just eliminate all the fluff and fuss, people. This is essentially all that you need to achieve pizza perfection. The Bianco-DiNapoli tomato sauce is smooth and the house-made mozzarella is top notch. I've toyed with this pie in the past, adding sopressata or even sausage at one point, but I ultimately feel it tastes best in its purest form. It has since become what I refer to as my ""reference-level"" pizza - meaning that it's what I compare basically every other margherita to when dining out. And thus far, none have even come close to tasting this good.

Marinara - Allegedly, this is Bianco's favorite of his six pizzas. Personally, it's my least ordered, despite still being what I'd consider to be a very good pizza. With this, you have the same tomato sauce, some very thin garlic slices that don't overpower, as well as a bit of oregano. It's very bare-bones, but due to the taste of the charred crust, combined with the sauce, I wouldn't quite classify it as boring - just basic. Probably too basic for some, however.

Sonny Boy - This is the closest you'll get to a traditional pepperoni pizza. Although instead of pepperoni, Bianco uses sopressata, the same mozzarella found on the margherita, and the inclusion of some olives (which I typically eliminate). And while the sopressata is good, it's never really been a pizza that ever stands out as memorable.

Biancoverde - Three cheeses and some arugula. You're combining mozzarella with parmigiano reggiano, and ricotta.  Simply put, it works incredibly well when you're in the mood for something meatless. 

Wiseguy - This one has smoked mozzarella, roasted onions, and some excellent sausage. My girlfriend, who typically hates sausage, likes this - as do I. Once again, it's done in a way where absolutely nothing overpowers, creating a perfect balance of meat, cheese, and subtle onion flavor. 

Rosa - When I first tried this pizza nine years ago, I described it as ""strange."" Now, after sampling it more times than I can count, I consider it to be Bianco's crowning achievement. A pizza that's completely unlike anything else you'll try, but yet still feels like it's a part of a long-standing tradition that goes back a century. You have your well-aged parmigiano reggiano combined with some extremely thin red onions. And when I mean thin, I mean razor-thin to the point where their presence is so restrained that even someone who dislikes onions can find the positive in this. Additionally, a small amount of rosemary and Arizona pistachios are added. It sounds strange - and it kind of is. But nothing beats the first bite of a Rosa slice when it's fresh from the oven.

In the end, this particular Bianco location will always be special to me - as it taught me a great deal about pizza that I never knew. And while I have since developed a preference at dining at their Town & Country location due to the expanded menu, you still can't go wrong with what can be obtained here.

The pizza is perfect. And when you've achieved perfection, how can you give it anything less than a perfect five stars?",5,2,2

It is a little on the expensive side, and the waits can be a little long, but don't let that stop you.   

First off, the wine bar next store is perfect.  We usually grab a bottle of wine and a cheese plate and enjoy the Hertiage District gardens.  There's also a pretty decent pub across the street, but since the wine bar is linked to Bianco they'll come find you there when your table is ready-a small bonus.

Of course, the real reason to come is the pizza!  Supposedly Chris Bianco spent a few years hunting down the perfect flour, water, and yeast for his unique pies.  Whether it's true or just a legend, the taste seems to back it up.  The crust has a perfect light and chewy texture that's still crisp on the outside.  It has a nutty flavor that I haven't had anywhere else, probably a combination of the wood smoke and overnight resting of the dough.  I usually go for the Sonny Boy (tomato sauce, salami, and olives)  but you can't go wrong with any of the six pizza choices I've tried.  If you do go for an option with the red sauce, you'll be impressed by the simple, fresh taste of the superb tomatoes.  The cheese and remaining ingredients are every bit as fresh and complimentary to the balanced flavors.  Bianco is the perfect special occasion pizza.",0,0,0

Additionally, I was told that along with their supposedly legendary pizza, were the legendary wait times.  With that in consideration, I strategically planned my visit to be on an in-between time on a Saturday afternoon well after lunch, but fairly before dinner time.

Being downtown, if there's any free parking, I didn't find it, and I parked in a pay garage easily within walking distance.  Pizzeria Bianco would validate my ticket, and in the end, I still paid just a dollar to park for this place.  Regardless, it's located in one of the nicer parts of Downtown Phoenix near all the sports complexes, and not within any eyesight of any of the slummy looking areas.

Regardless of my odd time I chose to show up, there was still a wait, but it wasn't to the extent of three hours as some other users may attest to.  30-40 minutes wasn't bad, mostly because of neighboring Bar Bianco we were suggested to wait at, which was definitely worth a trip in its own right, due to the smoking hot woman working the bar, the Four Peaks beers on tap, and the comfort of a relaxing outdoor country-style patio where I could people watch and enjoy some suds on a not-hot November afternoon.

When I got seated, the interior is very sparse, but an intimate, cozy feeling, and not at all pretentious as a place that might have three hour waits might make a customer feel.  The centerpiece of the establishment is the giant stone oven where pizza is wood baked freshly to order.

I ended up ordering a Wiseguy, but my friend ordered a Rosa.  Trying both pizzas, I'd have to say I preferred the Rosa, but my Wiseguy wasn't bad at all.  If you're thinking of commercialized New York style pizzas with tangy sauces and the entire produce section on it, you probably won't like Pizzeria Bianco.  Their's is definitely more along the lines of artisan, Italiano style, where everything is fresh, tastes fresh, and is absolutely delicious.  The centers are soft and chewy, but the crusts don't make you feel like you're eating wood, either.  $16.00 for my Wiseguy doesn't in the least bit feel steep at all, considering it's far less than what I'd pay for a satisfying steak dinner or something else considered ""fine dining.""

Anyway, we spent the hottest day of the year (118 are you freaking kidding me?!) at the Science Center. I thought, ok PB is next door and there is no line, so we went for it.

It was about 4:45 and the place was practically empty! So the 6 of us rolled in and were seated immediately. Fabulous.

The menu is simple. Love that. We ordered the salad, roasted garlic pizza, margherita pizza, the Rosa, and the chocolate flourless cake.

Oh my stars. The food is excellent. What more can be said after 800+ reviews? My favorite was the Rosa pizza. Carmalized red onion, pistachios, rosemary...now I'm not a pizza expert (like I am with cupcakes and coffee lol), but this was probably the best pizza I've ever had. And I can't believe I'm saying that since I've traveled all over, and the best pizza ends up in my own backyard? 

Chocolate flourless cake was also the bomb. So fudgy and rich and dense. So good!

Service was excellent too. Maybe because we were only  1 of 3 tables, but still. Food came out super fast, waters refilled, nice chit chat with the server about the owner Chris and the concept of the restaurant...I mean the whole experience from start to finish was perfect.

A simple cheese-less pizza with tomato sauce, oregano, and garlic, it was simply incredible.  The sauce tasted fresh and very garlicky.  The crust was thin and chewy, charred in some places, but that's to be expected when baked in a wood-fire oven. I read that Chris Bianco's favorites are the Rosa and Marinara.  Definitely with him on the Marinara. Outstanding.

This isn't the place to loosen up, stuff yourself silly , and quaff beer by the pitcher.  If you're on a date or entertaining an out-of-town couple, it's pretty hard to beat.  But if you're looking to feed a softball team or a sizable collection of drinking buddies, don't even think about it.

Getting seated at Bianco reminds me of doing the same at Zachary's ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/JsqK99Ka8gIgu1ZtzDupRg ) in Oakland, Ca.  You walk in, a receptionist takes your name, and they give you a projected wait time that can be as long as an hour.  Right around this time I'm thinking it'd be nice if we could wait in a bar, chat over a beer, and somehow be summoned back  when our table was ready. To my utter delight, our waitress informed us that LO AND BEHOLD!!! SUCH A SETUP EXISTED!!!  We were quickly shooshed over to a rather pleasant bar next door where the lengthy wait passed by painlessly as we sipped drinks and chatted up the locals.  The bar was crowded too....and I had my doubts about the restaurant staff's claim of a Saint Bernard-like ability to find us in the crush of humanity....but find us they did, and minutes later we were seated and perusing the bill of fare.

First off, a glimpse at the menu told me I was in for something completely out of the ordinary.  Pizza's only came in thin crust, and were served in only one size.  There was no build-your-own list of toppings, and the pre-defined combinations didn't look anything like standard pizza parlor fair.  On the other hand, the sizable wood-fired pizza oven in the corner looked fascinating, and Bianco himself was running the kitchen with a focus and dedication that bordered on religious fanaticism.

Tires hit pavement when the pizzas showed up.  I've gotta say it was dang tasty, and I didn't regret the wait or the expense one bit.  Still, if you're craving a more Chicago-style pizza, this just doesn't cut it.  The ingredients are fantastic, the preparation is perfect, and the ambiance isn't lacking in the slightest......but halfway through my first pie I found myself yearning for something thicker, and wound up fighting the urge to grab two pieces at once or fold one over to simulate a thicker slice.  If, like myself, you hail from San Francisco, it's similar to Pauline's Pizza ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/tIzKxpADKMMmzDr5n07lQg ) on Valencia between 14th and Duboce.

All in all, Pizzeria Bianco was great, but nothing to set the world on fire.  It was tasty, and it was without doubt a high-quality pizza.  East Coasters with their love for a thinner, more spartan pie will probably see it's virtues....But as for myself, I see it in the same way I do Pauline's Pizza in San Francisco...memorable and worth the visit, but it  never comes to mind when the pizza craving rears it's ugly head...",8,1,5

We arrived at 7, but didn't get seated until almost 9. And that's what Bar Bianco next door is for. Italian wine, home-made Italian bread and a small
cheese platter (all with very reasonable prices) made 2 hour waiting seem only like 45 minutes.

The pizzas are definitely worth waiting for. All are made by the owner, chef Chris Bianco himself. We ordered 4 different types, from Wiseguy (wood roasted onion, house smoked mozzarella, a bit spicy fennel sausage), BiancoVerde (everyday freshly made mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta and Arugula) to salty Sonny Boy (tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, salami and Gaeta Olives). Let me just say, for someone who could care less about pizza, I would definitely come back again in 2 weeks for these pizzas, accompany with their delicious Italian wine collection.

- Reservations are only accepted 1 month in advance, and only for group of 6-10 people
- According to my friend, if you have left over, don't microwave it! Warm it up on the stove instead.

We drove in circles trying to find this place. Oprah had declared it one of the best places to get a pizza pie in the USA and we had to check it out.  It's not the type of place where you can pull up out front park and walk in. Its in a little courtyard by the Arizona Science Center and you have to navigate a bit of a maze to find it.

We arrived at opening time and there was already a line. Luckily we got a seat no problem and had excellent attentive service. We split a refreshing salad and split a pizza that was half the sonny boy and half wise guy. The pizza's are wood fired and are thin but filling.  I loved the spices in the sausage.

Elegant pizza in a cute rustic restaurant with attentive efficient service.

I get really worried when someone whom I don't know very well tells me something like this because it's impossible to tell the development of one's palate. So I did what any Yelp!er would do, go on Yelp! and see what everyone thinks. And it didn't take long for me to see that when it comes to Pizzeria Bianco the thin line between love and hate was clearly drawn around the wait time. Similar to the law of diminishing returns in economics, I am a firm believer that there comes a point in time where eventually no matter how good the food you're waiting for is - it's just simply not worth the wait. 

I think this really comes down to how much do you like pizza. If you think that Papa John's or Domino's makes the perfect pizza, I can pretty much tell you that you probably don't want to wait anymore than 30 minutes for this place. BUT if you're foodie and you can appreciate the art of pizza making in a wood burning oven, this will be 3.5 hours well spent. 

Seeing how Ed Levine wrote an article in the New York Times about Pizzeria Bianco titled ""The Road to Pizza Nirvana goes through Phoenix"", I was pretty settled on trying this place out no matter how long it takes. I got there about 45 minutes before dinner service (5pm-10pm, Tues. - Sat.) and was greeted by a line of about 50 people. Once dinner service begun, the hostess took our name down on ""the list"" and estimated that it'd be about 3-3.5 hours from there (once you get your name on ""the list"" you can go on with your life as long as you call and check in about every hour). 

I checked back an hour later and the hostess told me that they were running ahead of schedule for 2 tops that night and that I should close out my tab at the pub across the street and head back to the pizzeria. So when we finally got seated, my buddy and I was HUNGRY (you can do a lot of damage with a nice simple menu in front of you when you're hungry). we decided to start things off with the antipasto plate and then we ordered the ""Biancoverde"", the ""Wiseguy"", & also the ""Margherita"".

The Antipasto plate was solid. For the price, I'd say that it was about the right size. The ingredients were FRESH. The olive oil was very tasty. The ""Wiseguy"" pizza was alright. While the pizza was solid, nothing about this particular one stuck out to me. The ""Biancoverde"", however, was pretty much fail proof because we added prosciutto ($4) to it. The first thing I noticed about that pizza was that the ENTIRE pizza was covered with prosciutto. As I took my first bite, the fresh mozzarella REALLY stuck out - it made the biggest difference in the world. The ""Margherita"" was also solid - the tomato sauce was superb. I think the key here was to order the right things. For example, I was most impressed with the Biancoverde, but if it wasn't for the prosciutto that we added, I don't know if I'd still feel the same way. Don't be shy about adding things to the pizza - you've already waited so long in line, treat yourself the a pizza the way you want it!! =)

I think what makes Pizzeria Bianco a hit is that besides how they really use pretty quality ingredients, their crust is simply superb. It's got a perfect hint of the smoke aroma from the fire and also the perfect balance between the crunchy outer crust and the soft inner crust. 

While I can say without a doubt that the pizza at Pizzeria Bianco is awesome, I would hesitate to recommend this place to everyone. Like I said earlier, if you consider yourself a foodie, don't do yourself a disservice by skipping out on this place because of the wait time. It's like the saying that ""where there's smoke there's fire"", for ANY restaurant that can tell people to wait 3 hours for food and only do dinner service 5 days of the week while having only about 12 tables inside... you know that you're either onto something or this is the greatest scam in the US of A...

If you're on the fence about this place still, try this place with a party of no more than 2. The party of 3 that was literally right behind us in line before the open was still not seated when I was leaving the restaurant (that's after an appetizer and 3 pizzas!!!)",6,0,5

I couldn't see why not, but just then several large parties arrived and went in first...due to the reservations allowed for 6+ rule.  The line started moving and sure enough, the cut-off was right in front of me.  We'd have to wait.   My friends were irritated, even though I'd done the longest wait, but I dug in my heels and said ""I'm staying, you guys can go elsewhere if you like"".  They stuck with me and we went to the other building for an hour or so.  We had a cheese plate and more wine in the meantime.  Our number was up and we were stuffed into the last table at the back of the room.  We ordered 2 pizzas to share.  They were good but being so thin, not very filling and the dessert selection of tira misu wasn't very exciting.  We got the impression they didn't care much if we were satisfied, just wanted to keep the line outside moving, so I left still a little hungry.    Added annoyance was I forgot to have my parking stub stamped and had to pay the entire fee when I left.  So not a great experience I'd say.

I looked it up and saw all the rave reviews about this place and the warning to new customers that you will expect to wait at least an hour or 2 to get a table in this place. BUT, if everybody's mama and mama's mama is raving about this place, I have to go right?! The waitress took down our names and gave us a buzzer letting us know it will be about a 1 1\/2 hour wait. Okay.. no surprise.. we expect that we will be waiting a long time. So we walk next door to their bar area which looks like it used to be a house and snag a seat outside in the patio. You can grab a drink or two while waiting for a table. Finally the buzzer goes off, ""SWEET.. now we could eat!"" We immediately know what to order. The Mozzarella is supposed to be handmade was delish.. very fresh and goes naturally well with the sweet steak tomatoe and olive oil. Our pizzas finally arrive which we ordered the mozzarella with sausage and basil pizza. Pizza dough was chewey and not too thick or thin. It kind of reminds me of LA's Urbano Pizza or a lot of these fancy gourmet pizzeria places but if you ask me if it is worth 2+ hours of wait time to get fancy pizza? UMmm.. probably not. I think I would go at least once if you are new to Phoenix and you want to just go for the experience.

I took a date there and we were quoted an hour forty-five to two hours and 15 minutes. Seemed liked a lot for a Thursday night, but was planning on waiting. I thought the stars were totally aligned though when I was able to find a spot in their tiny parking lot. I guess it can't all be perfect. So we ventured over to Bar Bianco (review to follow) for a few drinks to pass the time. We were pleasantly surprised that in about an hour and a half they were ready for us next door. 

We took the first available seating which was up at the bar. I have to say I forgot just how small this place is. The bar is nice, but we were both wishing the top of it came out a little more. It was a little awkward trying to sit on the stools straight. It does however make it more conducive to talking, almost like a table. The atmosphere was great and we even had a short conversation with a few of the other bar inhabitants. 

The bartender\/server was very attentive and greeted us right away. Took our drink order and he poured them right then and there. We decided to go with a Sonny Boy and the Biancoverde. Within 10 minutes, I think, they were both out and done to perfection. The salami on the Sonny Boy got nice a crispy on the edges and the olives were nice and salty. I was also pleasantly surprised by the Biancoverde. It is a white pizza with ricotta and arugula. It was nice and creamy. We ate all but two pieces and left feeling satisfied.

I have NO idea who he is and what his job description is besides opening the door for people but he seemed very out of place and odd, especially if you've been going here for a while. He even pointed out and said ""There's Chris Bianco"" as he exited. I thought it was weird and unprofessional. 

Everything tasted equally delicious this time but they had music playing, which was different and it just seemed like a different dynamic. I hate to be a snob about this place but I enjoyed it just the way it was: No one was overly attentive, Chris (now his brother) said bye to you as you were leaving, and you knew what to expect.

I know Chris and his business partner split up but I hope this isn't a beginning of some change. I'll still continue to go there and hope the ""new guy"" backs off a little.",2,1,1

The restaurant itself was really cool. The wait seemed a bit unnecessary as there were several open tables, but it didn't bother me. The staff was super laid back and it made for a fun time. The Margherita and the Wiseguy were all over reviews so we had each and a half pizza of Sonny Boy. Hands down Sonny Boy was the best. Margherita was really good too, but the Wiseguy kind of disappointed. 

We also had the Spiedini which was good, but not worth the cost. Looking back at the meal, the cost didn't seem to line up with the level of taste. It was good, but not $40 good.

The moment someone labels something ""Best (whatever) in (wherever)!"" my immediate reaction is to think there is a giant media conspiracy afoot to trick all the gullible peons into thinking they're onto something really special.

So you can imagine my disappointment when, over a year ago, I finally got the chance to try this place, and found it to be...good?  OK, I still didn't think ""Best in America!!!"" was warranted, and I didn't think it was worth the 2-3 hour wait to eat dinner at a reasonably early hour, but the meal was clearly enjoyable.

Fast forward a year.  We're driving around town on a noble quest to locate the best pizza in Phoenix, and we decided we ought to try Bianco again, just as a yardstick.  Now I have had some of the most highly rated pies this fair metropolis has to offer: I've had different crusts, different toppings, different sauces, and I'm starting to notice the little things that make the difference between a good pie and a mediocre one.

Going into Bianco with this perspective yielded a whole different outcome.  I can no longer deny it: Pizzeria Bianco makes an incredibly good pizza.  The little things were all there: the crust was perfect, the sauce was fresh and flavorful, the ingredients were high quality.  The toppings were simple, yet sublime.  This time I had the Sonny Boy, which has nothing more than tomato sauce, mozzarella, salami, and olives.  A very unassuming mix of toppings indeed, and one in which the flavors worked together in perfect harmony to placate my tastebuds in the most authoritative manner imaginable.

No, it wasn't my favorite pie ever.  But it may have been the most well-constructed, and finessed.  In fact, I don't even know if I can say Pizzeria Bianco is my favorite pizza place.  I have had a few pies I liked better than the one I had at Bianco, but this one may have been the most technically sound, if that makes any sense.

So there you have it.  As much as it pains me to admit it, this place deserves its reputation.  One friend complained that they are too pretentious: I think they've earned the right to be a little bit pretentious.  If you're not too concerned about the details, you may not find this place to be that special.  But if you don't at least enjoy your pie, there is probably something wrong with you.

I don't know if Bianco will always be this good, since they're opening up other locations now, and when that happens, quality can suffer.  Let's hope for the best.",2,0,0

Without knowing anything, I started reading these crazy yelp reviews about waiting in line for 4-5 hours.  I thought to myself, ""Are these people crazy?!?!  It's just a damn pizza!""

Then I start reading... the #1 pizza in the country... Oprah ranks it her #2... and then I realized that I have nothing better to do while in Phoenix so what the heck.  A friend tells me it's not that bad on weekdays so I head on out to wait in line at 4:30pm on a Tuesday, 30 minutes before the place even opens.  It's 109 degrees out and there are already a bunch of people waiting in line!  After checking in, I easily have more than enough time to head back to the hotel to pickup the wife.  Two hours later, my life is changed.

I cannot give another pizza joint 5 stars ever again.  Pizzeria Bianco doesn't have the pizza's that I'm used to, it's just on another level.  If you're expecting a really good Round Table slice, it's absolutely nothing like that.  The toppings were just so fresh and flavorful with just the perfect amount of saltiness from the olives.  We had the Sonny Boy and the Wiseguy, both very different pizzas but equally amazing in their own right.

It's very possible that I gave this pizzeria 5 stars because I was just starved for 2 hours before eating and probably anything would have tasted good, but I think I really tried to be extra critical because of all of the hype.

Given flight options for a return trip from an Ironman competition in Cabo San Lucas, I chose a five hour layover in Phoenix to be able to knock this one off of the list.

I opted to sit at the bar and was treated to a hypnotic view of the innards of their famous wood fire oven. As a first timer, I thought it was only fitting to go for the classic margherita pizza. The crust is probably the most perfectly crisp that I've ever had in a neapolitan, and the basil was perfectly sweet (as proper basil should be). Did I finish an entire pizza in one sitting? You bet.

So, is it the best pizza in the country? Having been to both Pizzeria Beddia in Philadelphia and now here, I can still honestly say that Pizzeria Beddia ruined pizza for me, and that Bianco is second to it for my palate (although they're two very different styles of pizza).

All I've had is the pizza, but I've had most of the menu (not difficult with only 6 choices).  The last time I went my friends added additional items which didn't improve their pizzas.

The positives -- good crust and fresh organic ingredients

The negatives -- poor pizza design, poor execution, long lines

One bit of good news is that Pizzeria Bianco is now open for lunch.  The last two times I've eaten here there was no line; both were afternoon meals.  The lines are still long in the evenings.

I like the crust, as overly thin and slightly burnt as it might be.  And I appreciate the organic ingredients.  But they just don't taste very good.  The Margherita and Biancoverde, two pizza styles I normally love, are just kind of boring.  Supplemental ingredients (expensive to add and the restaurant actually adds too much of them to your pizza) don't help.  The Sonny Boy has sort of a sharp olivey flavor which isn't desirable, and the Wiseguy pizza is less than the sum of its parts.

But in addition to the flawed pizza design, I've experienced inconsistency in the pizzas I've had.  The same pizza can taste substantially different on different visits.  Some might argue something about each pizza being unique because they are made by hand, but my experience is that it is simply poor execution.

One last item.  This didn't contribute to the review, but is worth noting.  This has to be the worst pizza I've ever had ""the next day"".  Whether eaten cold or reheated (something I do with a lot of pizza), it is borderline inedible.  Not a requirement for a good pizza place, bur don't over-order because your take home portions will just go into the trash.",7,2,1

We get off work and head over to meet them at 5:00, when the place opens. There is a small valet lot (full) and a public parking garage ($12.00) which the restaurant will validate (only $9.00, though, you still have to cough up $3.00). Our dinner companions already had a table inside which was great because there was a huge crowd outside. Inside, the restaurant is teeny-tiny, with maybe six tables that seat four or more, a few tables that seat two, and a bar area where people can eat. The bathrooms are one-at-a-time only and the ladies' toilet did not flush properly. 

I scanned the menu and quickly realized that they serve pizza and some salads - that's it. So if you have any dietary restrictions you're pretty much f*cked. While we are waiting for our food to arrive my dining companions inform me that they showed up at 3:00 to secure a table. THREE?!??! and they WEREN'T the first in line either! WHAT? 

Bread comes and it is homemade and delicious, with a crispy-outside, spongy-inside thing going on, and the inside was the best - soft and delicious with huge swiss-cheese-like bubbles (don't know how else to so eloquently put it). Then drink refills come. No one else is being served (so they fire up these orders TO order, not bad, okay). I didn't have salad but they looked pretty good - buffalo mozarella and fresh basil, huge slices of tomato for the caprese. Kalamatas on the baby greens salad. 

Pizza comes out, finally! $12 each for personal-sized pizzas with thin crust. The four-cheese was great; you can really taste the separate flavors of the cheeses. Arugula on top. A couple of the pizzas had salami or sausage on them. Too salty (and I LOVE salt so yeah, that's saying a lot if even I am critical on that point). One pizza's crust was not burned but charred black on half of it. But it's food so it can't be perfect every time now can it. 

A table of two finished\/paid\/left. They were the first people to finish from the first wave of customers and it was after 6:00 pm when this happened, and there was still a shitload of people outside. Meaning that if you don't line up at 3:00 to get in at 5:00, the soonest you can be seated is after 6:00 (and that's likely if you showed up between 3:30 and 4:00 for a table). 

Here's where it gets tricky - we paid, but were finishing our drinks. We were NOT the only ones there taking up a first-wave table who hadn't left yet. And after paying $150 for PIZZA (give me a break, please) the hostess came over and asked us to clear out because ""people waiting outside are getting upset."" Hey, I can see how that sucks for them but we're customers too and so is everyone else around us who have been lounging around for this long. When we exited the restaurant the people waiting outside were giving us (and everyone else who was leaving) DIRTY looks. Bitch please - it was YOUR decision to come here and wait in this ridiculous line, for one. For two - the food isn't that great anyway. Would I ever come here again? Hell no would I ever wait in a line that long for ANYTHING, not even if they sprinkled diamonds on the overly-salty meats.

Tips:
-Get there early and put your name in, as you will likely be in for a long wait. You can call them to see where you are in the waiting list and get an estimated time.
-They have a bar next door you can chill at where they will come get you when it is your turn to eat.

They can't possibly have a wait for a table at 2:30 pm on a Friday."" Well, turns out they did but fortunately we only had to stand out in the 100 degree sunshine for 15 minutes or so. We've actually attempted to eat here a few other times over the years but when the wait time was quoted as 2 - 3 hours we moved on to dine somewhere else. So, was this pizza worth the wait you ask? Yes, it was absolutely worth a 15 minute wait. But no meal is worth a 3 hour wait. I think it's really silly that they don't serve pizza out on the patio or next door in the wine bar or just take reservations... its sort of a power play that they make people wait around for so long like that. I just don't get it.

Anyway, I was surprised that the menu didn't have a whole lot of options. I really felt like a red sauce so that cut our choices down to three pizzas. I opted for the Margherita since that is a nice classic but of course hubby wanted some kind of meat so we added sausage. That was a very good decision since the sausage was absolutely delicious. We both loved the pizza and it was just the right amount of food for the two of us. Hubby didn't feel like it was worth the $18 but that is about what you would pay at other non-chain artisan pizza places that offer that neapolitan style pizza so I was fine with it. Our service was ok though a bit rushed. By the time we were done eating there were a few empty tables so I didn't really see why it was necessary to take our plates away immediately after my last bite (seriously, I was still chewing) and then bring the check immediately afterwards without asking if we wanted anything else. I guess that is just how they do things there.

I was introduced to the Pizzeria back in oh, 1995 or so when one of my co-workers mentioned something about this little pizza joint that was getting rave reviews in the NY Times or something like that and he had to find it and try it for himself, so a group of about 10 of us went searching for it for dinner that night.  

It took us awhile to find it as it wasn't nearly as famous back then as it is now, and GPS and cell phones weren't invented yet so we had to rely on paper maps and phone booths (I know, some of you younger folks are scratching your head and saying what's that?).  

What we found was a very small place with a bar and wood fired oven, and a very long wait.  I was skeptical of course, I mean, how good could something as simple as a pizza be to be worthy of an hour wait?  Well, I was pleasantly surprised and to this day it's the best pizza I've ever had.  As others have mentioned don't expect the usual pizza fare here, although in this day and age the ingredients aren't nearly as unique and surprising as they were to us 18 years ago!   

I think we got at least one of each of their pizzas as it was a fairly limited selection.  The thin crust pizza from a wood fired oven, smokey mozzarella and fresh mushrooms and veggies, fennel sausages on an olive based pie with no tomato sauce was just awesome and nothing like I'd tasted before.  I recall we ordered an insalata caprese which at the time I'd never heard of, and it's since become one of my favorite salads to make.

Arugula salad - very good
Sonny pizza (salami and olives) - delicious - thin crust and the right ratio of sauce to toppings
Flourless chocolate cake - also delicious but I wish it would have come with ice cream and not this weird melted cream thing on the side.

Oprah hit this shizz up a few years ago, chefs list it as their ""last meal to eat on this earth"" or something on their ""Best of"" list and this place just blew up. 

my grandparents have lived in AZ since the 80s and visited Bianco, pre-Oprah, and didn't have to wait for 2+ hours to get a slice from Chris Bianco's oven. I went last December post Suns game, hoping that since we got there around 9, the wait would be shorter. yea, I was wrong, but the wait was worth it and i liked the ""waiting arrangements"" next door at a little victorian house that felt like someone's house with a full bar in it, complete with board games and mags. my boyfriend and i waited for 2 hours or so (note: they do not take your name after 10pm to wait for a table and they do not take reservations, obvs), until our name was called and we sat down in the smallest little dining room ever - basically you are on top of the oven where the golden pizza comes out of it, but i was ok with that. the ambiance was very ""italian grandma's kitchen"" and i loved it. 

we ordered 3 pizzas for the 2 of us. i mean, we're not crazy, we didn't know the last time we would be back here and willing to wait or lure other people with us you would be willing to wait - so naturally we needed to bring home some leftovers (b\/c Bianco does not do carry out or delivery). we got the white pizza (my fav especially because i would rather have my pizza without sauce, very italian and very cheese+bread you might say, but i don't care, sauce ruins the pizza most times), margarita pizza and some other pizza that my boyfriend ordered prosciutto on top of it (we can call that one the mainly meat one). they we are AMAZE...amaze. i brought the pizza home to my dad and showed him the goods we scored; he was proud of me (i mean this is the most coveted pizza in the US people, the big O put the gold coating on it), he proceeded to eat the pizza in the morning for breakfast, warmed up in the oven of course. it was AMAZE then too, i took a few bites (it was hard to eat more pizza after i consumed so much while at Bianco)

the hype is for real. the pizza is the shizz. this is it, your pizza holy grail. get on the next flight to AZ or get your ride on the 101.",1,0,3

What can be said about Pizzeria Bianco that hasn't been said 1476 times before. I've been to Pizzeria Bianco on several occasions and the food and service  live up to all the hype. 

All the entrée's at Pizzeria Bianco are delicious.  However, my favorites are the caprese salad, Sonny boy pizza with a glass of wine, what a perfect meal.

The taste, texture and flavors of the woodfired oven pizza is second to none. I understand why there is usually a wait when going to Pizzeria Bianco. So if you get frustrated while waiting in line, which is a normal nightly occurance, I suggest going on the off-hours. If you're in the area give Pizzeria Bianco a try and then you can say ""I had some of the best pizza in the US",5,1,3

We were only a party of 2, and I regret not going with more people to try as many pizzas as possible. My friend got a salad with pears (or maybe apples?) and I got the prosciutto-wrapped cheese skewers. We shared a margharita pizza. It was exactly the right amount of food for us.

My friend loved the salad; the skewers were ingenius. Who doesn't like melted cheese on a stick?!!! The pizza was very tasty -- there was some kind of cheese, asiago or parm. reggiano? baked into the crust. Every bite was tasty, from beginning to end. The crust was perfecto.

- I enjoyed every last bite of it
- The onions really brought out the flavor of the fennel sausage
- Definitely recommend!

SERVICE: I sat at the bar and the bartender was really friendly. All the staff members seem to enjoy working with each other to help the customers are happy. I didn't know there was bread offered but the bartender highly recommended that I try the bread with the balsamic vinegar and olive oil.

ENVIRONMENT: very casual. There is indoor and outdoor seating available. Depending on the day outdoor seating may be a great option while sipping a glass of wine or draft beer. Inside dining may be a little cramped but the pizza will definitely make up for it!

The Wiseguy had a thick layer of wood roasted onion that enhanced the fennel sausage.  The biancoverde was almost too salty but the arugula on top was a nice counter point.

Only pizza\/food considered, I'd probably give it a 3.5 or 4 stars.  However, half of dinning is the experience.  And when it comes to Bianco, the experience is terrible.  Basically if you don't like to wait longer than 1-2 hrs for a table, you should go somewhere else.  The owner purposely keeps the place small so the wait time is always over 1 hour.  They only take reservations for 6 or more people (assuming availability).  They own the house next door and have converted it to a bar\/waiting area.  Actually even the waiting area requires you to wait in order to score a seat inside.  Otherwise you are doomed to wait in the 100+ degree heat on the porch.  

Having eaten at Bianco, I am really perplexed by why there is always such a wait.  I mean the pizza is pretty decent but bang for buck it's really not that much better than the Phoenix chain NYPD (NY Pizza Dept).  The only assumption I can make is that Phoenix area lacks well-reviewed restaurants so people always flock to Bianco because it has been pretty well-publicized.  

As for the food, Bianco has pretty good pizza.  After all the chef did grow up in Brooklyn.  The pizza is thin crusted, good amount of cheese and sauce and they are wood-oven cooked.  The menu has a choice of 7 or 8 pizzas, a few appetizers and a few deserts.

If you want good pizza without a wait, go somewhere else.  If you want to wait for 2 hours, eat good pizza and be able to say you ate at the pretentious Bianco's then go try it.

ADDED: Finally, I think part of the reason why I think it is over-hyped is because it is pizza.  In my opinion, something like Bianco's pizza has minimal ingredients and uncomplicated tricks of the trade.  Of course there is probably a lot of skill that goes into making the dough exactly the right way and I can respect that.  He does a good job at that.  The sauce probably has some ingredients and seasonings that add to the quality.  But at the end of the day, it is pizza...and American pizza at that.  He makes all the pizzas himself because he wants to, not because he has to.  If he wanted to, I can't imagine it would be terribly difficult to hire assistants to help him put the sauce, toppings and cheese on.  =)",8,6,7

So for my birthday I decided it would be a fun spot to take my husband. First the pizza was as good as always... But this time the service was UNACCEPTABLE! 

Kari was our server and she was terrible. It took awhile for her to come over to us initially. She bussed a table before even greeting us (in a not so busy restaurant at the time between lunch and dinner). This is a forgivable offense, but then she never checked on us, she never asked how we were, she never asked if we needed anything or if we liked the pizza until our pizzas were gone. She asked if we wanted another beer only after it had been empty for 10 mins and the meal was over. She never refilled the water, someone else was nice enough to do that for her! 

And here's the worst part: when we ordered the anti-pasta dish we were told it wasn't available until 5pm, yet another table (which happened to be employees \/ friends of the manager) got the same dish 20 mins after we ordered it. So it wasn't that it wasn't available, it's that it wasn't available for the likes of us. When I asked about it, Kari said well sometimes it's available sooner than 5pm. Did she bother to ask if it was available for us? No! When I mentioned, ""oh, it looks like they work here"" (since the hostess sat down with them) She said, ""well yeah, they're friends of he manager."" To which I respond: ""Favoritism is always appreciated."" So thank you very much for the horrible experience! Did she offer anything else in exchange? No! I didn't even bother to tell her it was my birthday. I asked for a manager. ""Oh, I'm sorry there isn't one on duty!""

People have to wait so long that they either go get drunk or get so hungry that the food tastes amazing once you finally get it..... plus people need to justify the wait. But alas, I have fallen for their tricks. We got there at 4:45 and had to park in the garage which has validation ,but not complete validation, it still costs 5$ (Lame!). We found the restaurant by looking for a mob of people. We got in the 30 min line to put our name on the waiting list... whoa. When we got up to the front we found out the wait would be 3.5 hours, but at least we didn't have to stay the whole time. I think that is the best possible thing this business has done. If I had to sit there for 3 hours, I would not have been a happy camper, but we went to Body World and came back and only had to wait 15 min, so that was great. Also our wait wasn't really 3.5 hours, it was more like 2 hours 45 min. Whatever. So we got some drinks at the bar and then got called in to a table. The waitress was nice and very apologetic about the wait, so at least this restaurant knows to be courteous to it's customers unlike a different restaurant I recently went to *cough*postino*cough* There were four of us and we ordered two appetizers and two pizzas. We got the roasted veggies with cheese and sopprasetta (sp?) and the fontina wrapped in prosciutto. They were both amazing!! This was the best part of the meal. The veggies included purple cauliflower, carrots, squash, asparagus, sunchokes, and olives. They were sooo good. Roasted and kind of sweet. These were some of the best veggies I have had. Also the cheese, I don't remember what kind it was, was so creamy... it tasted great on bread. However, nothing touched the fontina wrapped in prosciutto. I have not had prosciutto before because I don't like bacon. 

Yes, I don't like bacon.

But I was being so closed minded because prosciutto is delicious. And this was especially good, it could have only been better if there were more of it. The BF and I ordered the biancoverde and our friends got the wiseguy. I didn't try theirs, but our was very good. It was garlicky, but the flavor was more subtle than it usually is. The three cheeses were great and the arugula tasted very fresh. 

So the problems include: long wait and no dessert. Why doesn't this place have dessert? (oh except for biscotti... biscotti is a weak dessert choice). The rest was good and if someone were to invite me to go back, I would, but I probably wouldn't go back on my own.",4,2,2

I've been here the once, after hearing my girlfriend and her roommate rant and rave about it. Our group was composed of my girlfriend and myself, and two friends.

First things first. Being where it is, parking is, excuse the language, a bitch. After arriving and finding that the very limited parking spaces had all been taken, I was forced to park in front of (presumably) another patron's car. Throughout the two hour wait and one hour meal, I was praying that I wouldn't get called out to move the car and find another parking space (ha, yeah right) or, worse, get towed.

After that was the wait. Oh God, the wait. Even though Bar Bianco right next door provides for a comfortable waiting spot with a great selection of wine and cheese to tide you over, two hours is two hours. Two hours is four separate deliveries from any pizza chain that knows what they're doing. Two hours is about half the drive to Las Vegas. Two hours is... well, two hours.

After the two hours of wondering just how good this pizza would be, we were finally seated and given menus at a simple wooden table inside the similarly simple and comfortably home kitchen-like restaurant proper. I was hungry and expecting nothing less than food that would give me an orgasm.

I didn't get it.

Don't get me wrong. The antipasti was good. The pizza was good - I especially liked Sonny Boy. But it was just that. Good. Not mind-blowing. Not life-changing. No sudden epiphany. No orgasm. The cappuccino was pretty good, though.

This is a place that lives - and thrives - on its reputation and exclusivity, which stems from the difficulty of actually getting seated and served. Pizzeria Bianco is one of those places which has transcended from ""a restaurant"" into ""an experience"", and deservedly so. The reputation is justified. The food is good. However, despite being pleasant and a must-do at some point during your stay in Phoenix, the whole experience isn't worth going through a second time; while the food and the ambiance justify the (very reasonable!) price you pay, the difficulty of finding parking and the wait are ALSO part of the experience, and is something that cannot be rectified. 

So unless you happen to enjoy waiting, my advice to you is to go there the once and experience it for yourself. And then, regale your friends with tales of how amazingly awesome the whole experience is, con them into going, and tell them to bring home some leftovers.",1,0,1

We went early-ish on a Tuesday evening, and were prepared for the infamous wait. The weather was lovely and we got a bottle of wine to enjoy outside while we waited (two hours!) for our table. Okay, it was a long wait and we got 2 bottles. 
By the time our table was ready, we were loaded and starving-Of course it was delicious! The crust was bubbly and crispy, and just slightly charred. The cheese and toppings were fresh and tasty. Then the obvious comparisons to Cibo came in. The quality of pizza was ever-so-slightly better, but when you take into consideration the wait, the limited menu, and cramped dining room, it falls short of its competition up on Fillmore.

We all know no one REALLY likes to wait 2-3 hrs to sit and eat..a pizza at that, but at the end of the day, it's worth it. Here's the key, plan on making a night of it.

Enjoy some wine next door (you have no choice ha) and sit back and relax. We like to order the olives with a nice glass or bottle while we wait. Be careful though, it's easy to drop $$$ before you even sit down to eat. The pizzas are truly amazing. Some people make it sound like they're heaven on earth...not so much, but definitely live up to most of the hype. By far my favorite is the Bianco Verde (no sauce, heavy arugula) so fresh and delicious. Everything is just so fresh and I gotta give this place love for the great mozzarella. You cant go wrong with any of them so choose what you like, I like to get the Margeherita sometimes and just add what I want . My biggest advice...order the fresh sliced garlic on the side. WOW.

The cottage next door is cozy and romantic. Def not your norm place, and not somewhere you want to be stuck with someone you can't hang out with while you wait. The restaurant is very cool, brick inside, dimly lit and the man himself is there throwing each pizza in the wood fired oven one by one.

Cited as ""the best pizza in America"" in numerous on-line reviews as well as on Good Morning America and as published in, Slice of Heaven, to most pizza lovers the three to four hour wait for a table is so daunting that they push on to a more open table atmosphere for their pizza experience. But to the true pizza enthusiast, Pizzeria Bianco is as much about the experience as it is the food. This place is best known for the owner Chris Bianco, hand tossing each and every pizza pie served every Tuesday through Saturday, from 5-10 pm for nearly 15 years, of which I was one of those fortunate customers. However, early 2010 Chris was forced to retire due to illness and turn over the pizza paddle and oven duties to his protégé of 15 years, Horatio Hernandez. 
My decision to try Pizzeria Bianco for the first time came from a challenge I put upon myself: Find the best food in metropolitan Phoenix. After hearing about Pizzeria Bianco from a friend, I made gourmet pizza my first battle in 2009. I knew about the long lines forming an hour or more before the restaurant opened, and this beautiful fall day was no exception. I arrived 60 minutes before opening and my date went to Bar Bianco to start us off with a couple of pale ale microbrews while I held our place in line. Seeing that there were only about 20 people ahead of us, we assumed we would make the 5:00 seating with no trouble. However, just as we were holding a place for the rest of our party, so were the 20 or so people ahead of us, and when the door opened promptly at 5:00, there were now over 50 people ahead of us. Needless to say we were left waiting another hour since the restaurant seats only about 40 at a time. 
When we were seated at 6:00, the four of us started with the homemade mozzarella, local tomato and sweet basil starter with extra virgin olive oil drizzled all over as well as homemade crusty bread with a dish of EVOO with a touch of balsamic added. We ordered three pizzas, the Sonny Boy providing salami, marinara sauce and gaeta olives, the Wiseguy a sausage and mozzarella taste explosion and the Marinara with Prosciutto di Parma. All three pizzas were piping hot when they arrived, just crisp enough around the edges and loaded with the most amazing flavors your mouth has ever experienced. We left the restaurant without remembering the nearly 3 hour wait and were fully satisfied, eager for the next opportunity to drive to 623 Adams in Phoenix for another ""slice of heaven"". 
And so, after hearing of the departure of Chris from the kitchen, curiosity got the best of me. I had to challenge this place and find out if the changing of the guard made any difference in the wait time, the food quality or the overall experience I had truly fallen for. April 6, 2010 again I ventured down to 623 Adams in Phoenix to see if a Tuesday night or a new head chef had made any difference at all. My date and I arrived at approximately 4:00 pm, one hour before the doors would open. We found a line of about 25 people and looked at each other and said, almost in unison, ""Well, the wait hasn't changed"". 
Bob trotted off to Bar Bianco to find our pale ale, Four Peaks to help pass the time. We caught a glimpse of owner Chris Bianco and I told Bob how I would love to chat with him seeing as I was writing a comparison review, I also wanted to find out who was cooking tonight. Bob stalked Chris into Bar Bianco and asked him if he had any time, would he be willing to take a picture with me and answer a couple of questions. When Bob returned with another beer and Chris Bianco in tow, I was star struck and could barely speak. All I could muster up was, ""Are you cooking tonight?"" To which he replied, ""No, I have Horatio at the oven. I can't cook anymore."" I explained my evaluative writing topic and he assured me the experience would be the same. We took a picture and off he went, back to the bar. 
At 6:15pm, after 2.25 hours of complete social enjoyment we were called to our seats at the bar. We ordered the same items we had enjoyed last fall with the exception of the Marinara. The overall experience was better for me as I got to enjoy personal time with Chris. As for the meal, it was just as amazing as I remembered it from 6 months prior with Chris tossing the pie for every customer. The flavors were exactly as I remembered and the service from the staff was top notch, just like the first time. From the wait to the taste, it didn't appear that anything had changed! 
So what makes for the ""best pizza in America"" and how did Pizzeria Bianco get the tag line? Well, my opinion is flavorful ingredients, a phenomenal social experience, and an owner who lives by what he serves. To Chris Bianco and the Pizzeria Bianco staff, you haven't skipped a beat!",7,2,4

In fact, chef and owner Chris Bianco won the James Beard award in 2003. This original Pizzeria Bianco is located in Heritage Square and right next to the ASU (Arizona State University) Downtown Phoenix campus, but there is also another branch located about 6 miles away from here.

Parking: If you drive around the block, there's a parking garage at North 5th Street (right next to the Arizona Science Center) and Pizzeria Bianco will validate your parking ticket. The restaurant also offers valet parking, but the valet driveway was completely blocked with cars when we came here.

Wait time: First of all, the restaurant closes at 9 PM sharp. However, the staff will still let your party come in if you are already on the waiting list before 9 PM. Our group came here at 8 AM and the staff told us the estimated wait time was 75 minutes. One of our friends went elsewhere for dinner as he let his hungriness dictated his final dinner decision. Ultimately my other friend and I stuck around and were able to get a table at 9 PM.

Menu: A very simple menu - 6 different pizzas, 3 salads, 2 small bites, and half a dozen extra bites. You are allow to split one pizza into two different options, but you will be paying the one with higher price. I got half Sonny Boy ($19 for whole pizza) and half Margherita ($16 for whole pizza) and the whole pizza ended up $19 and not $17.50. My friend ordered one glass of Dragoon Brewing IPA and he claimed that it was the best alcoholic beverage he ever had. He checked their website later and only to learn that Dragoon Brewing IPAs are only available in the Tucson and Phoenix market.

***

Half Sonny Boy [tomato Sauce, fresh mozzarella, salami, olives] and half Margherita [tomato sauce, oregano, garlic and no cheese] ($19): Toasty thin crust pizza with soggy (in a good way) center. Margherita was EXCELLENT with light and flavorful tomato sauce. Sonny Boy is essentially salami version of Margherita, but I think salami tasted a bit oily. Sonny Boy was still a very good pizza, but I personally prefer Margherita.

If you are a fan of thin crust pizzas with amazing tomato sauce, then you will love this place. Personally Pizzeria Bianco is for sure one of the best pizzerias that I have ever had in my life because I am a big fan of thin crust pizzas.

The restaurant is nice and cozy and very small.  When the weather is cooler I would expect longer waits simply on the small size of the place alone.  The pizza oven was directly behind my and I felt sorry, if only for a moment, for the two guys manning the oven.

The wood fired pizza will bake quickly.  Don't expect to wait very long.  That is one saving grace if you do happen to get stuck waiting.  Most parties should out in a timely fashion unless they decide to hang around too long after they eat.  This is the kind of place that anyone with common courtesy will depart when they are done eating.

The Bianco pie is hyped.  While it is very good I can think of two places off the top of my head that are better (neither is located here in AZ).  Based on the food alone I would normally give a place like this 4 stars but two things irk me about Pizzeria Bianco: value and selection.  You must choose from a selection of only 6 pizza varieties ranging from $12-16.  If you want to leave with a full stomach expect to order 2 or 3 pies and expect to drop some cash.  I shared a pizza with my friend.  The 3 slices rationed to me were akin to eating on slice of your standard pizza.  

Service was friendly and attentive and they will validate your parking ticket if you are parked in the garage next door.

The wait is long and might only be worth it if you can't get similar style pizza elsewhere.

There were 4 in our party so we ended up ordering the Margherita, Wiseguy, Rosa and Biancaverde.  The only pizza that we all felt wasn't that great was the Rosa.  It had a few cheeses on top plus AZ pistachios.  It just wasn't flavorful and was quite dry.  The wine paired with the pizzas was great.

Anthony's in Denver Colorado smokes this. Wiseguy in DC the same. Shit even Hanny's downtown here is far better.

The best?

The fucking balls....

In case you're wondering, the best is probably Joe's in the West Village. NYC. Go there. Before you die. You're welcome. And it's inexpensive! It shouldn't be. Unpretentious....Pizza the way it has always been made from way before hipsters started to ""reinvent"" it and then call it more ""authentic"" so that they can then feel superior (as usual) and charge you more. And by the way it's not in Italy either, I've been there... Having a few somewhat decent pies right there in Rome and Trastevere. Most notably Dar Poeta in Trastevere.

Food and Wine named them one of the ""Best Pizza Spots in the U.S.,"" and Bald Bryan was always singing their praises on the Adam Carolla Show. So of course I had to check them out.

Besides the high praise, I had also always heard to expect a long wait. So I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived at 6 and found several empty seats outside. I ordered a pizza, half Rosa and half Wiseguy, and some of the house white wine. The Rosa had red onion, Parmesan, rosemary, and pistachios. The Wiseguy was topped with smoked mozzarella, roasted onion, and fennel sausage. Both choices were good, but not as awesome as I had expected. I actually was more impressed with the house wine.

This is a traditional wood-fired pizza, light on the toppings and with no tomato sauce. And while I have no problem with that, I've had much better wood-fired pizzas elsewhere. That said, I'll leave it up to you whether this is one of the best pizza places in America. I definitely think it's worth a visit, but not if you have to wait three hours.

Whether the establishment has succeeded for its average patron is subject to debate.  (As a general caveat, do not trust in any Phoenix-based review of this restaurant.  Phoenix is not even remotely a world class dining city, and any restaurant in the city cannot be objectively judged by any resident of the Phoenix metropolitan area.)  The national pundits have touted this as the best pizza in America, by icons like the Food Network and even Oprah Winfrey.  Whereas the food was of acceptable quality, the dining experience itself leaves a great deal of room for improvement.  

Upon entering the restaurant, an air of pretension washes over the diner; the restaurant and its staff is adequately aware of the recent press surrounding Pizzeria Bianco and it is apparent in the treatment of its patrons.  I got the distinct impression that the staff was doing me a favor by seating me, instead of me doing them a favor by providing business.   

Aside from the ostentatious behavior, there is typically a 2 hour wait.  This is an egregious wait (even though I was mentally prepared for such a wait).  Beyond that, parking is difficult to come by considering its smaller-than-fast-food style parking lot (and Phoenix is not an urban environment; driving is almost mandatory).  The wait times have accumulated due to the national press and, on a purely subjective judgment call, the ever increasing desire of everyone in Phoenix to be a part of something trendy.  Since the wait was so long, the anticipation of the food's delectability grew in our already whet appetites.  To hold us over, we treated ourselves to a few of the appetizers at the annexed bar next door.  Prosciutto was mediocre; the lack of creativity begins to seep in our impressions as the dish is improperly paired with poorly cooked crostini.  Next, we had a selection of 'gourmet' cheeses so entirely pedestrian that one might wonder if a Kraft representative was secretly replacing foreign cheese samples with basic flavors.  The cheeses did not present itself in a natural progressive order along the palette leaving conflicting flavors fighting over oral real estate.  

After repetitious glances at my wristwatch to gauge just how much time has passed, my party was finally called to our table (a total wait time of 2.5 hours).  Despite the lack of apology for the wait, my friends and I were excited to have a seat.  We started with a local organic greens salad.  The greens were not as fresh as one would have hoped; a lingering bitter taste hovers and is not well compensated by an unevenly distributed vinaigrette dressing.  We moved on to an Insalata Caprese (though the menu left the English translations; authentic Italian indeed).  This dish was delicious.  The olive oil was of high quality, as was the tomato, basil, and mozzarella cheese.  All ingredients were fresh and very tasty.  This basic dish was the single best piece of food served to us.  

Since there were several of us dining that evening, we ordered pizzas across the menu and shared family style.  The crust on each pizza was delicious; the quality of the crust can not be understated.  It handled well in strength and durability against pizzas with tomato sauce, and was stiff, and at the same time chewy, enough against pizzas that are largely cheese or meat based.  However, whereas my pizza crust was excellent, the others at the table complained that theirs was burnt; thus, the consistency the owner strives for by hand making every pizza is entirely suspect.  The other ingredients for the pizza left room for desire.  The sausage was fatty; sauce too zesty; selection of cheeses seemed out of balance with the accompanying flavors; vegetables were elementary and sometimes undercooked.  

In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.  The national critics must have been treated to a much better dining experience, because mine was only memorable because of how ridiculously over hyped this restaurant is.  This is a consistently emerging theme in Phoenix, the fastest growing city in the United States.

Pizzeria Bianco and Bar Bianco's property is very charming. We spent our two hour wait on one of the many benches, admiring the historic buildings, looking at Chris' gardens, watching kids play and generally enjoying the great weather. We also had a couple of good glasses of white, some excellent salami and crutons and a nice variety of green olives all from the bar. 

The hostesses at PB were impressive in their attention and professionalism. I don't know if they have great memories or hidden crib notes, but they immediately remembered our names, where we were waiting, how many were in our party (which changed during our wait) and what we were eating and drinking from the bar. I assume they also did this with all the other guests dispersed across the premises, which had to be at least 50 other people. 

When we finally did get in to the restaurant (at almost exactly the time predicted when we got on the list) we were greeted by Chris, who thanked us for waiting and were immediately given menus. After a couple of minutes our very personable waiter gave us some details and got us going. It was a very efficient process that made us feel attended to and gave us a sense of progress after the long wait.

Pizzeria Bianco's food was excellent. Their version of spiedini, with prosciutto wrapped around fontana was served on a bed of greens that was dressed with a tasty vinaigrette. The tomato\/mozzarella\/basil was good-- although the tomato was not the best I've ever had. Then again, we were the dumb asses ordering a tomato in March in Phoenix. Had we been keeping true to our principles we would have gone with the market greens salad, but we were so taken in by the thought of the mozzarella we couldn't help ourselves. And the mozzarella, really, was worth tolerating the average tomato.

The pizza was unlike any I've had before. The dough was extremely thin, and the crust was so light it reminded me of a well executed popover. It was unique, flavorful and appealing. The topping combinations were very enticing. While we both wanted to try the margherita, we ended up being draw in by two pies that didn't have tomato sauce. The Rosa, which had an autumnal, nutty flavor from ground pistachios, rosemary and onion was fantastic. The Wiseguy, which I had read about on numerous occasions because of the house-smoked mozzarella and fennel sausage was spicy, smoky and lived up to the hype. 

All in all, our evening at Pizzeria Bianco was wonderful. I have a great admiration for Chris Bianco's dedication to his craft and his insistence on making pizzas one at a time with superior ingredients. He has created a charming, relaxed setting with his restaurant and bar, and employs individuals who work at making your time at their establishment a memorable one. Sure, two hours is a long time to wait for pizza. But if you approach the wait as just one part of the whole evening and allow yourself to be taken in by the small corner of the world Chris Bianco has created, you'll have an opportunity to experience food created by people who truly care about their craft. And isn't that worth a bit of a wait?",5,0,4

The only reasons I am giving this place a 4 instead of a 5: 1) they were out of the original market salad (something like spinach, goat cheese, strawberries, pecans), they told us that they had some still but ran out immediately after (I was not too upset, as the replacement was great as well but my family was a bit upset). 2) The pizza here was amazing, but it was not particularly amazing in comparison with other upscale pizza joints in Phoenix. Cibo, La Piazza PHX, etc, are all delicious brick oven pizza restaurants that are magnificent and I love the style of pizza they serve, but I think they are all equal. I didn't think pizzaria bianco stood out as being the best pizza, it was just like the other highly-rated pizza restaurants in phoenix.

It was busy down town, so even at 230\/3, we hade a 40 minute wait or so. We started at bar bianco next door with a few drinks and appetizers. I had the hard apple cider -really good and we shared the cheese plate and the ricotta crepes. Yum! The Bianco Dinapoli tomato sauce with the crepes was really good, we dipped our bread\/crackers in it. 
Once our table was ready they called us over to the restaurant. We had a table for 2 inside, it's a bit small inside, making it pretty cosy. 
We ordered just the Rosa pizza, the one with pistachios. It was really good. Good medium size ish pizza with great flavor. Good for 2 to share. While I did like the bar, the appetizers, pizza, and the location...I'm just not sure I want to wait 40 mins to 2 hours to get in every time.",0,0,0

I mean I really love pizza. It's good.  And I have eaten pizza in Phoenix, Chicago, New York City, and Europe....I even tried a mexican pizza at taco bell once, thus putting to test the old adage that there is no bad pizza; only good pizza and great pizza.

Now I am very much aware that Pizzeria Bianco has literally been reviewed a thousand times, but I figure I might as well get my two cents in.  I first dined at Bianco's in 98 and have been coming back ever since.  It's my favorite restaurant.  This was also the first time I realized that pizza can truly be more than just pizza and that more often than not the simplest of pizzas are the best..  I remember the first bite I ever took of the Margherita pizza.  It was phenomenal. How do three ingredients on some crust taste this good?  One bite and it was like a Party in my mouth.  Seriously.  I'm not joking. It's that good.  I can't adequately describe through words how good it is.  And that's all I am going to mention about the food, enough has been said already.

Many people have heard the nightmare stories of 3 hour waits to be seated for dinner.  Well, it's true.  Be prepared to wait.  However this used to be a bigger issue years ago.  Now you have options. 
 
Make an evening of it.  It's worth it.  Get your name down on the waiting list. Go for a stroll around Heritage square.  It's beautiful.  Really.  Especially at night.  Bar Bianco and the more recently opened Rose and Crown Bar are also great ways to pass the time while you wait.  Hang out.  Throw back a few drinks.  Have a smoke. Be social.  It won't kill you.

So my advice to you is stop being a baby about it, and try not only the best pizza joint in this god forsaken city, but one of the best restaurants in Phoenix overall.",8,6,7

Actually, the high level of anxiety probably drives up their drink sales, so it might not be a bad business move.

Either way, as with most places, if you know what you're getting yourself into, then just plan for it and have a good time.  The pizza is really freaking good, and what's even better is that it reheats super well.  Just pop it in the oven the next day and bada-boom, bada-bing - lunch!

I had some margherita pizza ($13) and biancoverde ($16).  The margherita pizza was made with fresh ingredients, but it just tasted OK, nothing too special (Good crust though).  I was more intrigued by the biancoverde pizza.  The creamy ricotta and mozzarella meshed well with the more piquant taste of the parmigiano-reggiano and the almost nutty, crispy taste of the arugula.  The pizza was somewhat oily in the center and slightly soggy in the middle though, but that didn't detract me too much from liking the biancoverde.  

We were a large party of 8, and service was OK.  Minus some points for not getting a sugar basket for our iced teas despite asking for one (I like them sweet!).  The iced teas themselves ($3, free refills) while nice in that they were organic, really didn't have too much taste to me.  It was so mild I thought I was drinking colored water.  They offer Mexican Coke in glass bottles ($2.50), which is a nice touch for those that want real sugar in their regular Coke.

Is this pizza I would wait 3 hours for?  Not really, but if I came on an off day or a less busy hour I would be willing to try some more pizzas from them.",1,0,1

Flew in from DC on a Friday afternoon, checked into my hotel, and went straight to Bianco's. Arrived around 4:45pm and the place was about half-full. I grabbed a seat at the bar & ordered one of the tap beers (a local brew) and a margherita with sausage.  The pie came out about 5 minutes later. 

Overall, it was a great pizza. Delicious airy crust, nice balance of tomato & cheese. I do wish I hadn't added sausage--it was applied with a VERY heavy hand and I ended up removing a good deal of it so it wouldn't be overwhelming.  Service was also great; the bartender checked on me several times.  People at the bar were friendly, as well, and I ended up chatting with one couple as they recommended other restaurants to try during my stay. 

I guess my issue was that yes, it was a good pie and good atmosphere and I enjoyed it, but it didn't blow my socks off or change my life.  It was just a solid experience. I would say I've had better pizzas in DC.  So, for me, it didn't live up to the hype.",1,0,0

The salad was extremely bland with only greens and oil nothing else. Please put at least a mixture of spring greens if you're only going to put lettuce in your salad.  We had 2 pies. I like to try unique pizzas, and they have one with pistaccios.  Had to try that, and we had one of their other suggested pies with salami and olives.  Both pizzas were beyond charred, and trust me I love an extra crispy thin crust pie.  These were both ridiculous.  I would understand if I asked for well done, but these were their normal cooked pies.  The salami and olive pie was inedible; it tasted like a burned salt lick.  The pistaccio pie was too burned to get the flavor, but from what I could tell it too wouldn't of been that good.  All four of us that dined there that night are pizza fanatics, and we were extremely excited to finally dine here.  We were all terribly disappointed.  The price was very reasonable considering the quality of ingredients.  They should know when to pull a pie out of the oven, or at least within ten minutes of that time.  They should keep an eye on a wood fire oven like that instead of letting pizzas almost start on fire.  I can't believe they didn't remake them, and actually sent those pies out.  Maybe that is why everyone waits 3 hours to dine here, they probably burn all the food and have to remake it.",2,0,0

I can also say, having been to Italy, that this is truly authentic as well. If you are into Americanized pizza (Domino's, Papa John's, etc), you will NOT like this place. If that's you, or even if you really love NY style or Chicago style pizza, I suggest you skip this place.

It's a small place. VERY small. That's why there is almost always a wait. Also, the menu is small as well. They focus on making a few things very well, and use fresh ingredients to do so. You won't see any pepperoni, ham or pineapple here.

We were lucky, and when we got there around 1pm on a Saturday afternoon, there were 2 seats open at the bar. Now my ONLY knock on this place will be how uncomfortable I was sitting there. I am tall, but not that tall (6'1""), and I was just cramped. The bartender was very friendly and helped us with some suggestions.

Depending on how hungry you are, the pizzas could be big enough for 2 people to share. The bartender recommended, since it was our first time, that we each order our own pizza and share. I ordered the Biancoverde - Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula. It was REALLY good. I would definitely order this again. My friend ordered the Sonny Boy - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, olives. It was also really good (although I liked mine more). That salami was legit though!!

They offered a few local beers, which was awesome. The food didn't take long to prepare because of the super hot brick oven they use, which I am sure helps them turn over a huge crowd each day. Overall, this was a great lunch and I am really glad we made it. There was nothing really disappointing about it (other than my own discomfort, which was worth it). The bartender even wrote down some local bars for us to check out when we asked.

The market salad was very standard, just some greens with olives, and I would skip it unless you absolutely had to get some veggies. 

The pizza crust itself was perfect. Thin but not hard and with a good chew. Really quite wonderful. Unfortunately I thought the toppings left more to be desired.

Marinara with Wood Roasted Mushrooms - I didn't feel like mushrooms were the best add on for the cheese-less marinara pizza. There were some slices of garlic mixed in the pizza to add some flavor, but the small slices of mushroom looked a bit sad among the wide expanse of marinara. Would recommend getting something more substantial on top.

Rosa with Prosciutto - This was a white pizza and the prosciutto was a really great addition to the pizza. It was pretty savory, and I enjoyed it despite not being the biggest fan of cheese. Preferred this to the marinara.

All in all, the pizzas were enjoyable enough, but I found myself somewhat bored and limited by the toppings. I wish they had some more creative toppings (with more veggies!). Check out their menu - if the pizzas on there look good to you, then you'd probably enjoy it - but if you're like me, and prefer more creative pizzas with a greater variety of toppings, then perhaps try your luck elsewhere.",0,0,0

They are the pizza's that we've come to expect at pretty much every pizza place with a wood burning brick oven over the last 20 years or so.   We expect quality ingredients, fresh arugula toppings, etc.  So they are not re-inventing anything here.  The menu is very small, with limited selection of toppings and combos.  Two pizzas and no drinks for two (we got btl at bar before we sat down) was $50; which is fine, but i definitely wasn't 'wowed' by the pizza.  In fact, I've had much better, and for less.  I've also paid more - so price wise, this was in the middle, although maybe slightly above average.

This would have a 3 star - A-OK rating from me rather than the 2 star 'meh- i've had better' rating - if it wasn't for the deplorable, disinterested service.  
We had great bottle service at the associated bar\/waiting area next door.  Unfortunately, the same friendly and attentive service didn't carry over to the dining room.  If they had truly great service, they could bump this rating up to a 4 - as in 'I'm a fan' - but they'd have to get an entire new staff probably to pull that off.

The hostess did not seat us, but rather pointed to a table for us as we walked in and she walked away.  The waiter never engaged us other than to say 'have you decided"" , shortly after we sat down.  We had - so we ordered.  But a simple courtesy greeting such as 'hello' or 'good evening' would have been both appreciated and socially appropriate.  Our pizza's arrived, and we ate them, with no question of if we needed anything else.  The hostess later came by to check on us (not our waiter), and asked how everything tasted.  I commented that it tasted like pizza - which it did.  Like every other pizza that I've had at any decent restaurant over the last 20 years.  Which is to say - it's very good - just not mind blowing.

Our waiter later returned when we were done eating and cleared our plates and asked about dessert.  We indicated interest, and he brought a menu.   The hostess momentarily followed with our check with an offer to 'take it as soon as we're ready'.  I'm not sure if they just have really bad communication between the staff, or if she was unable to notice the fact that we were looking at the dessert menu or what her problem was - but it was extremely rude to present the check at that time.  We were still drinking our wine, and looking at the dessert menu.  

The prices are more than other similar pizza places, but only by $2-$3 per pizza - no big deal.  Sp overall- if it weren't for the disinterested and abrasive service, I'd be back if in the area, although I wouldn't go out of my way for it.  However, given that one of the reasons I go out, is to be waited on; this isn't a place I would choose.  If i were in the area, I might consider for carry-out; but I suspect there are other places within a few blocks with similar\/equal quality pizza - perhaps better.  I'm looking forward to checking them out over the next few days.

Hopefully, we can get better service than the 'panera bread-esque' type service we received here.  if they had it set up as counter service rather than table service, I likely wouldn't have thought twice about the service.  But since it is set up like table service, and they only offer 'counter service' - it's a quite disappointing.  It didn't take any detective work at all to see that  no one in the place was getting full service, and that the staff had clearly not been hired or trained to provide such service.",2,1,0

Pizzeria Bianco was the worst pizza I ever had in my life!  We ordered Sonny Boy pizza.  So Expensive, and hardly anything to eat.  My friend took the first bite.  As soon as her teeth sunk in, and she didn't chew yet, she said ""something's wrong with this pizza it tastes like spoiled milk"".   When I bit into it, she was right!   Smelled and tasted like spoiled milk or vomit.  Crust was very soggy and gooey that you could stir, had no form you could pick up with hands, have to scoop up with fork or spoon.  I was shocked how tiny the pizza was for the money, and they only had this one size.  We sent the pizza back.

  First time in my life I ever sent a pizza back in my 63 years and not have it returned redone or baked longer.  We substituted and shared one $18 ravioli dish (no longer on their menu) at the waitress's suggestion, cos prices there were so expensive, I told her I wanted an entree with ""something more substantial that we could both share"".  The ravioli was just OK, quite bland, small serving, too. 

Since my friend didn't wanna go to Pizzeria Bianco in the first place (I was so adamant cos I read the reviews and wanted to try their pizza and we were in the Camelback and 20th St area), I felt I could not make her pay for half of the dinner that was so awful.  She is on disability.  She had a $5 beer, so she paid $5 for the tip.  Of course we were still hungry but we had to be at a theater, and didn't want to spend more money for mediocre food, so expensive.  

Dinner was so awful that I later called talked to Chris on the phone to give feedback.  He offered me a free meal, but I won't go back, because the things we ate were not worth it even for free, and I would not know what else to pick off the menu, it is not a large menu and portions are small.  We looked at other people's tables, at what they ordered. 

I am glad Pizza Bianco has many 5 star fans, and my opinion won't make a difference, because restaurant owners say ""You can't please everyone!""   That is true.  In case you are wondering, my favorite pizza in Phoenix metro is Mellow Mushroom's House Special, because of the crispy applewood smoked bacon in it, and I love combo pizzas.  Mellow Mushroom really packs on the ingredients and spreads to the edges, but the crust is not crispy and can never be made crispy the way I like it by baking it longer, probably because the dough ingredients.   I tried. But it is the kind of pizza that sticks in my mind.  Grimaldi has good pizza too, for me, anyhow.  I like thin CRISPY crust that crunches when you bite into it, and slice stays horizontal even 30 min after coming out of the oven.  I have not tried Cibo's.",7,5,0

I hear the wait times have improved as of late and am happy to see the expansions of this restaurant.   Looking forward to my next visit and trying new options!

Bar Bianco is next door and a nice atmosphere to wait in, making me usually a few glasses of wine deep when I finally get to eat, which makes the food that much better.  They also offer appetizers at Bar Bianco which are good if you are starving.
The Wiseguy pizza is my favorite, the fennel sausage is just unreal it's so good.  A close runner up is the Biancoverde with arugula and ricotta, delicious!  I also love the Margherita. Every bite just melts in your mouth.  To start I always get the Spiedini, which is super salty and amazing.  The salads are always as fresh as can be and the bread is great, too.

I would fight someone for a caprese sandwich at the sister sandwich shop Pane Bianco, but the pizza place didn't impress my when I tried it years ago and hasn't changed my mind in recent times. I brought my family here while on a pizza tour about a year ago and it didn't win any popular votes. With the recent launch of their cocktail program at Bar Bianco next door, decided to give it another try.

I met the soccer girls at the Bar. The place is tiny- cute and cozy- but so much so that everyone in the place can hear your conversation. Luckily, it was a cool crowd. The bartender was super nice and went above and beyond when he chased me down to return a bottle I forgot at the bar. My round one negroni was good (bonus point for the creative sub of punt e mes for vermouth), but my round two martinez tasted watery. The girls agreed with the cocktail assessment, good but not great. Too bad because the veggies and cheese on the antipasto plate were very good, as were the olives and sliced bread with oil for dipping. 

When a table opened up at the restaurant next door, they called the bartender to let us know (nice!). Unfortunately, you cannot order pizza and eat it in the bar, but they do let you bring your cocktail from the bar into the restaurant. Once in the restaurant, it's beer and wine only. We split the mixed green salad, market salad (same as the mixed greens but with apples and goat cheese), and a margherita pizza. The greens were fresh, but the dressing just tasted like oil. The real claim to fame here is the pizza and I have to say, it's not my fave in town. Tough to justify coming back for a $15 pie when I can get one half the price at Parlor during HH, or for the same price at LGO one loaded with toppings. 

It's also not a place that let's you linger and have a conversation with friends when you are done eating. They really turn the tables quick at this place- food comes out fast, check comes out fast, they were ready to pick up the bill and run before we had a chance to put our credit cards on the table. I guess it's fine since it was freezing inside and I was ready to get out and warm up. The place was packed on a Tuesday with a wait to get in. Good for them, I wish them lots of continued success. As for me, I'll stick to Bianco's other restaurants and be thankful to have so many other good pizza options in Phoenix these days.",0,0,0

And I'll get to the pizza. 

It was really good. We ordered the Wiseguy and the Margherita. The Wiseguy had roasted onions, smoked mozzarella, and very delicious fennel sausage. It was my favorite of the night. The Margherita was very good as well, but was pretty standard fare.

Besides the superb toppings, what really makes their pizza great is the pizza crust: it is the most perfect pizza crust that I've ever had. Amazing.

I'd have to say that Pizzeria Bianco is the winner. But, only barely. The Bianco Pizza was more consistent all the way through. The A16 pizza last time I had it was a little soggy in comparison the Biancos. 

We didn't do anything correctly for showing up at Biancos. We showed up at 8pm. And, waited for a table for 2.5 hours. It worked out well, because we just went next door and had a few glasses of wine before dinner. This worked out well and waiting isn't a problem (as long as you're with cool people).

The wait was surely worth it. Bianco only serves 6 pizzas. Only 2 with red sauce. But, the ingridents used were probably the most selective in Arizona. Think Thomas Keller particularism in Arizona. And, that's very difficult to do in Arizona - b\/c the ingredients here inherently suck.",2,0,2

Ordered a Margherita, Sonny Boy and Rosa. Rosa here seemed to be oilier and lacked flavor I recall at Town and Country, but the other two were solid. 

Beers on tap suck, as always. Uninspired Arizona piss, overpriced at $6.50 a glass. Makes it easy to choose not to drink, though. 

Service at the bar is always fantastic, but they are super busy with everyone spinning lots of plates right when they open. You'll see the same faces every time you visit over the years, so this must be a solid place to work. Lots of hustle by everyone, and food comes out reasonably quick. 

This place always satisfies, but I do prefer the T&C location. Much easier access, unless you enjoy navigating downtown, and a bit better product. Beware the douchers here that camp out for over an hour to be at the head of the line.

I always read Yelp for great, fun places to go for date night. This time I didn't have time to read the reviews but I had heard this place was on Oprah or the travel channel or some cooking show, so It's got to be great right? 

This date night we had tickets to see Les Miserables at 7:30 on a Saturday for my Man's B-day. I called the restaurant on Tuesday to see about getting reservations for Saturday because I had heard about the nightmarish wait times because it is just THAT GOOD! They said they only allow 4 reservations and they were all full. Umm, ok...Well that's just wonderful. I explained that we were willing to come early so we could be through and get to Phoenix Theatre for our show. The woman said to call back at 4:30 on Saturday and she would tell us how long the wait would be. I did and we got in after 10 minutes! (at 5 pm) Yay! I thought, this is a great start to birthday night.  

When we walked in it was extremely cramped, the tables are almost on top of each other. A very large man was seated behind us and I saw people just give up and go around. It was also EXTREMELY LOUD, the loudest place I have been in quite a while. We were seated right in the middle at a tiny table that barely had elbow room. I started to feel claustrophobic and couldn't hear a thing my man was saying and he couldn't hear me. I spotted and pointed to a newly vacant table in the corner and we made a mad dash for it. Ahhh... a little quieter but I still couldn't hear well. 

Then I looked at the menu which was only about four choices of pizza to order from. I thought that we would share a pizza but when the waitress came by she explained that the pizzas were about the size of a dinner plate and most adults get their own. Then I looked at the price and about had a heart attack! Now, I am not a tightwad, I will pay dearly for excellent food. Then I was shocked to see that for the price we were going to pay the salads were not included? Really? This is a pizza joint, not the Four Seasons Resort. 

The pizza came quickly. I was soooooooo disappointed. I am what you might call a pizza whore. I could eat pizza every day. I won't though because I would be huge. I ordered the Margherita and my man had the Sonny Boy. We were never served any bread and oil while we waited either. The pizza crust was so thin I bet I could have seen light through it and the sides were burnt.  I get the wood fired oven thing but this was ridiculous! There was a tiny amount of sauce, even tinier amount of cheese and 4, count 'em, FOUR pieces of basil. Now, I'm not saying it tasted bad after I broke off all the burnt pieces, it was just ok. It was nothing special and not worth the 40.00 we spent for 2 small pizzas and no drinks with tip. My hands were black and my man somehow got black all down his white sleeve. Then driving to the show in the car I noticed that I had black all over my neck! I know I really get into my pizza but come on! I shouldn't need a bath after. We won't bother coming here again because when we left I said to my man with a big grin on my face ""I'm still hungry where should we go for dinner?"" He laughed and said ""Me too! That was a huge rip off for $40.00 and you leave hungry.""  Our conversation was overheard by some guy and he said ""I hear that a lot."" Hmmmmmm",4,3,0

Kari and I cook at home, for ourselves and for groups, 5 or 6 days a week unless we're traveling. And we often cook even when traveling. Doesn't leave us much time for going out to eat. That said, our little group hits Bianco EVERY week. It's a ritual. One night a week, we go early, drink wine, get a grilled cheese or cheese plate, and wait... sometimes waaaaaaaaaaait. Knowing them doesn't get you in faster; in fact it might be a detriment. But it never disappoints. You really just have to make a night of it.

Tips for making a night of it:
  - come with people you know & like. a first date there can be brutal!
  - bring layers: if the wait is long, the weather can change.
  - plan on drinking and getting snacks next door at Bar Bianco.
  - bring games or other distractions: we're the idiots that bring mexican train dominoes or dice every week.
  - when Sue quotes you a time, it's accurate. live it.
  - make friends with the people who are waiting near you. some of them are in our foodie circle now. it's like a micro-YELP at the picnic table.

We've eaten pizza all over the country, all over the world... NYC, SF, Italy, Des Moines, IA & St Joe, MI... wherever! To say that one and only one pizza is the ""Best Pizza in the World"" is kind of ridiculous. But if I had to pick only one, last pizza, it would be Chris' Special - whatever he wants to make that night.

(disclaimer: i'm not gonna order the special tonight, i usually let everyone else do that and eat theirs. i'll order exactly what i want: margherita w\/mortadella, rosemary and garlic. but IF it were my last pizza ever... the special. and that night, the special would probably be: margherita w\/mortadella, rosemary and garlic).",17,8,13

Bottom line: Amazing pizza, but not worth the four-hour wait (both times I waited close to four hours).

The ""Wiseguy"" pizza is fantastic, and so is the pizza topped with onions and pistachios.  I've never had anything else like it.   

If you are still motivated to try Pizzeria Bianco after reading this review, follow this advice -- 

Show up at around 5:15 to put your name in, and then leave for the next few hours.  See a movie nearby, or just go home and relax.  Make sure you call every hour or so to check in... sometimes the wait is shorter than they initially say, although it wasn't both times I was there.",0,0,0

This is my favorite pizza. And my favorite restaurant. DO NOT GO HERE ON A FIRST DATE. You have to love the one you're with. Because you have to be patient. You can't get out of it. You will spend 2 and a half to 5 hours with them. 

The first time I went, I was not aware of the state of wait. So I drank at the amazingly cute bar next door. And drank. And drank. Drunk me shoved pizza topped with pistachios down my throat. Drunk me ranted and raved about how amazing the pizza was, but drunk me doubted my alcohol induced review. 

So I went back, socialized more, didn't chug my wine, and enjoyed my company. The pizza was even better. The crust will satisfy any ""type"" of pizza lover. It is hard to explain the consistency, but I am sure it has something to do with the really neat wood burning, brick made fire going in the corner. 

Some people want fast food, they don't like long lines, they think the wait is ridiculous. So here are our options. 

1. They go to reservations only. All of a sudden, normal people like us don't even get to ever try this place. 
2. They make a chain. Quality goes down cause the man himself ain't makin' the pies. 
3. They build a new restaurant. BOOM. Ambiance gone, atmosphere screwed, screaming kids everywhere cause the wait is short enough to tote the young ones with... Boo. 

Deal with it, enjoy it, because there is no where else in town you will be able to tell people that you waited for a table for 5 hours and IT WAS WORTH IT!",3,3,3

I know you will see all the 5 star reviews and the fancy accolades this place has received, but you deserve to know the truth. This place is terribly overrated, and I had by far the worst dining experience of my life here. I know this is long, but I hope you read it. 

I guess we were an anomaly because we only had to wait about 20 minutes. The waitstaff was fine. The place oozes pretentiousness, which is off-putting, but nobody was rude. 

The pizzas are fairly small and thin and cool off very quickly, but we wanted to try several of their interesting-looking pies. Our approach was to order one or two at a time so we could enjoy them hot. We selected our first one (the Margherita) and waited eagerly. 

The pizza was... okay. I probably liked it best out of anyone else in my group. The crust was okay. Maybe a little bit on the bland side, but still enjoyable. I liked the sauce. It tasted fresh and bright to me. Others thought it just tasted like tomato, not like good tomato sauce. The toppings were sparse. Basil is, like, the whole point of pizza Margherita, and there were only three leaves on it. The pizza was small and disappeared very quickly between four hungry people. 

We ended up ordering the Sonny Boy next. The waiter asked us if that was all we were going to order, which was kind of weird to us. We said we would probably get more, so he told us we needed to order them all then. We added another Margherita because we knew we liked it, but we were pretty annoyed. 

It felt like they were just trying to get us out as fast as possible, and we all got really put off by that. Going to a highly rated restaurant with the image that it tries to put forth, one expects to be treated well and for the staff to try to provide a nice, relaxing dining experience. Their approach is weirdly at odds with their image and reputation. 

We ate our 2nd and 3rd pizzas (The Sonny Boy was not my taste), and were still really hungry. The pizzas are small! We needed more food. 

Here's where things go from underwhelming and annoying to fully outrageous. The waiter brought us our check without us asking for it, and we tried to order another couple of pizzas before before he went off. He looked really uncomfortable but said he would see what he could do. A few minutes later, he came back and said we could not order any more. Uh, what? 

The spokesperson of our group asked to speak to the manager. A few minutes later, we see the waiter, the manager, and the hostess having a pow-wow in the corner, and we hear words drifting over to us (the place is really small). ""What should we tell them?"" ""Say... reservation... customer volume..."" They were clearly trying to think something up, invent a reason they wouldn't serve us. 

So, the manager comes over and starts telling us that their policy is that the order must be made up front to maintain the flow in the kitchen and quote accurate wait times for people. Okay, maybe that is true. Why is nothing about it posted? Why didn't the waitstaff ask if we had ever dined there before and told us how it worked? That mistake is on them. They said there was a reservation. One or our group said, ""That's funny, because I called a few weeks ago about making a reservation and was told that you don't make reservations at this restaurant."" Well, apparently they do, but only if you call at specific times a month ahead of time. So why did they just say out-right that they don't? ""So, the reservation is for this table right here. Not that table or that one. This one that we are trying to eat dinner at."" Yep, that's right, we were told. 

It was such bullshit. The attitude from the manager was appalling, treating us like we were a nuisance and like we did something wrong. He was clearly making things up on the spot to try to justify kicking us out. We paid our bill, tipped our waiter (it wasn't his fault the restaurant had a stupid policy and his manager was an asshole), and left. 

We were all completely flabbergasted. Had we just been refuse service? Guess it's more important to get as many people in and out as quickly as possible than to provide a pleasant experience for their paying customers. And the snobbery was disgusting. They seem to think their mediocre pizza entitles them to treat their customers like shit just because Oprah likes it (and it's a mystery why). If accommodating a lot of people is your priority, don't set up shop in a shed! If you present yourselves the way you do, Bianco, people will rightly assume that they are going to be treated like guests and be able to enjoy their experience. 

Now, they're expanding to my city, Tucson. Their pizza is only okay, and their attitude sucks. Their success is undeserved and makes me rage. Please don't support them.",1,0,0

I have a story to illustrate how good the place is.  This is not a joke - this actually happened on our first visit.  As we were advised to do, we arrived several hours before they opened.  This was back when they had more limited hours and they weren't open for lunch.  We waited in the line, but it wasn't too hot out, and we had a nice time.  When we finally sat down, we were hungry.  But before we could order, a very normal looking middle-aged woman entered the restaurant and approached our table.  She said her son was visiting from out of state and they had to take him to the airport, and they didn't have time to stand in the line, but her son's favorite thing in the world is the Sonny Boy pizza from Pizzeria Bianco, so would we mind ordering a couple extra pizzas to go when we ordered our meal?  Apparently Pizzeria Bianco doesn't accept takeout orders, but they will give you a pizza or two to-go if you order them as part of your meal.  Before we could say no, the woman was already thanking us and I had $40 in my hand.  We were stunned.  When our server approached us, he asked if we knew that woman.  We said no, and we told him the truth when he asked what she wanted.  He told us he'd take care of the situation, and he went outside to chat with the woman.  Then she stormed back into the restaurant, told us we threw her under the bus, demanded her money back and marched back out of the restaurant.  Pizzeria Bianco is that good.

Their crusty bread that they serve is delicious.  It tastes like they put a little extra salt, but the texture and taste is unlike any other bread I've ever had.  The crust is very crusty while the inside is fluffy with lots of air pockets.  The crust for their pizzas are the best I've ever had as well.  Very chewy and great taste.  They do tend to get soggy in the middle so the very tips of the slices can barely hold together when you move in for the bite, but the crust is fantastic.

The toppings are another story.  They're fresh ingredients and you can tell this, however..  I heard the Wiseguy was the most popular one.  It has roasted onion and sausage on it.  Barely edible.  We also got the Sonny Boy and Margherita pizzas with a few toppings added to it.  This is what I learned - the olives and prosciutto are very salty, sausage is tasty and just about as salty as one would expect.  The basil is used sparingly and the arugula is not.

The appetizers were very good, but kind of overpriced.  We got the caprese salad which you can tell the cheese is freshly made that day.  We also got some cheese on sticks that were wrapped with prosciutto on a bed of arugula - that one was fantastic.  You get 2 sticks about 7"" long and I think it was $12.  Overpriced, but I would recommend it.

All in all, I enjoyed the experience - hanging out in line from 350 til 5pm when they opened and started seating, meeting the friendly wait staff (not the ""hostesses"", the down-to-earth wait staff with the t-shirts and aprons), getting close to celebrity (saw the lady from The Practice and Lie to Me - Kelli something - and her husband that was on some kid show that I'm not familiar with AND Mayor Gordon and his family came later), and paying a hefty price for dinner but not really feeling shmucked about it.

Located in Heritage Square, and next to the Arizona Science Center, Pizzeria Bianco is a very small restaurant.  When the popularity started to mount, wait times could exceed four hours.  Although the fanfare has seemed to die down somewhat from a national standpoint, Pizzeria Bianco still attracts crowds.

In order to avoid any potential long wait in the 110+ degree weather, we got there early enough to beat the crowds and were seated immediately.

The meal started off with some nice crusty bread that was super soft on the inside along with some nice fruity olive oil.

The handmade mozzarella, tomato, basil and extra virgin olive oil salad is a take on the margherita without the bread.  The mozzarella is super fresh, the tomatoes were a little lacking in flavor and the basil added a nice herbal punch.  A classic salad with few ingredients could have been elevated with riper tomatoes and just a touch of salt.

The pizzas are cooked in the wood burning oven that dominates the kitchen and is the focal point of the restaurant.

The ""Wiseguy"" pizza includes roasted onions, mozzarella and fennel sausage.  This is a nicely balanced pizza as the roasted onions brings out the sugar in them to cut the sharpness of the fennel.

 The ""Biancoverde"" pizza includes fresh mozzarella, Parmegiano reggiano, ricotta and arugula.  We added anchovies to this pizza.  The pepperiness of the arugula cuts through the richness of the cheeses.  I personally did not like this pizza, especially with the addition of the anchovies, but my dining companions loved this pizza, and was their favorite.

The ""Sonny Boy"" pizza includes tomato sauce, mozzarella, salami and Gaeta olives.  The saltiness of the olives totally overwhelms the rest of the ingredients.  If they were cut into smaller pieces, perhaps this would work better.  After taking the olives off, this became a much better pizza and each ingredient was able to shine on its own.

The classic ""Margherita"" pizza includes tomato sauce, mozzarella and basil.  We added wood roasted organic mushroom and prosciutto.  On its own, the Margherita pizza is fantastic, but the addition of the mushrooms added a nice earthy flavor while the prosciutto added just a hint of salt.

Is this the best pizza in the country?  That can be argued forever and never answered, as food is subjective.  I do applaud the freshness of the ingredients, and that everything is hand crafted.

The salad was great (we got one of each), the tomato on the caprese was HUGE and the mozzarella was fresh. I love that they bring you bread and evoo.

I've been going here for years, since Chris' place was in Town & Country mall, next to my other old favorite Coyote Springs Brewing Co. You could go in for lunch and not have to wait one bit. I don't even remember if he was open for dinner, but damn we used to go 2-3 time a week for lunch. 

So flash forward to when Jerry Colangelo coaxed him into moving downtown, as part of Jerry's dreams of a DisneyLand downtown. The waits got longer and longer, and as of about two years ago were still tolerable. The last time I went was just before the Oprah\/Martha Stewart mess, and at 9:45 only waited 40 minutes for a table. People wait longer at Oregano's. This is no longer possible though as half the time they cut off the names at 8-9pm if they realize they are going to be there to 1am to accommodate everyone. I'd say average weekday wait is 2 hours, weekends 3+. I can ONLY, and I mean ONLY justify this because I live across the street.

The food is amazing, and literally the perfect pizza. The crust is perfect, the ingredients all extremely high quality and homemade much of the time. Gotta love the Shriner's Sausage as well. I like Cibo's Antipasta better, but everything else about Bianco nudges them out. One thing you can count on too is no matter how busy Chris is, he will absolutely aknowledge and smile at you. It's that kind of thing, letting someone know you appreciate their business even though you don't need it, that really counts. 

Even with the awesome food, and fun ambiance, is it worth the wait? I'm not sure any pizza is worth waiting 3 hours for, and like I said, if I wasn't able to walk home, watch a movie, and then come back, I'm not sure I'd go back. You can go to Cibo and have no\/little wait... sure it isn't as good, but I have to question if any pizza is that good. Try it once at least, and be your own judge. You owe it to yourself.",3,1,3

Got there at 7:30 on a Tuesday night... 2.5 hour wait.  (To be expected, but still pretty ridiculous.)  

Went next door to Bar Bianco, ordered a bottle of wine and patiently waited outside.  I think that the wait is part of the allure for people.  Also, after waiting hungry for 3 hours, the food becomes tastier because you are starving.  

Finally get a table at 10:15.  Order the caprese salad and another bottle of wine.  The ingredients are very fresh.  The Mozz is excellent, the tomatoes are very very fresh and tasty and the basil was great as well.  

The server didnt make any recommendations on wine or food.  A bit odd.  Given that the wait is 3 hours and that it's pricy for a pizza joint, you'd think that the service would be excellent.  Not at all the case.  This guy acts like everyone here is a regular.  The reality is that with 3 hour waits for a table, i don't have time to be a regular at this place. 

We ordered 2 pizzas to try.... Biancoverde and Wiseguy.  They were pretty good, again with good ingredients.  I wouldn't say it was the best pizza i've ever had, but very tasty.  Asked for some Balsamic to go with the Mozz and Tomatoes... had to ask the server 2 times, finally we snagged a food runner, she got it for us.  I shouldnt have to ask for something 3 times. I mean really, this place only has like 6 tables... pay attention to the guests.  

I guess the moral here is that trying this place is all about the experience and saying that you've been there.  While Bianco is good you can go to Parlor or Cibo and get very good (comparable) pizza without a 3 hour wait.

Is it worth the wait, nope.",8,0,1

I've looked over the reviews and the number one thing people seem to have an issue with is the wait time. 

All I can say is, don't go here hungry or in a HURRY, and for god's sake go near CLOSING time if you really want to indulge here, who the hell really wants to wait 2+ hours for dinner at PRIME hour, I sure as hell don't!!! 

Another issue I've noticed is that the staff is ""snotty, hipster or too cool for themselves"".

We were seated on the patio because the inside is quite small & it was lunch time so they were a bit busy. The best part was that there was a cute dog at the table near us...

If you're from New York, just go to DiFara. You'll be getting a better pizza at any of those places AND you won't have to wait for 3-4 hrs. Sometimes in situations like these I think that folks walk away saying ""That was totally worth the wait!"" so they don't feel like idiots for waiting that long for pizza that is good, but not THAT good. 

We got the Wiseguy, Margherita, Rosa, and Sonny Boy. The fennel sausage on the wiseguy was pretty weak and the pizza overall was under salted. Too much smoked mozz just made the crust soggy. The sonny boy was better but a little boring. The Margherita was great (but once again, you can get better elsewhere.), and the Rosa was awesome. If you like Parmigiano Reggiano, you will love the Rosa. I have to wonder why they even bothered with the pistachios as you can't really taste them through the strong flavored cheese, but still wonderful.

Prior to eating here, I'd read raves and reviews of this bastion of thin crust pizza in Saveur and Gourmet Magazine.  The proprietor is kind of a lunatic - he makes his own sausage... but I like that kind of fanatacism.  He kind of reminds me of the Soup Nazi... and having eaten the crab bisque there at least a dozen times... Seinfeld DOWNPLAYED the vibe.  It is what it is.

Once we found the place, (there was a lot of construction and accessibility was kind of wonky) we waited for about 45 minutes... they do have candle lit tables and wine service while you salivate, waiting patiently for a table to become available.  This restaurant is definitely part of the ""slow food movement"" -  the salads are incredibly fresh and crisp, and the pizza... definitely worth the wait.  Obviously, you want to implement some ""strategery"" and arrive early, so as not to get stuck in the queue.  

If you want the equivalent of pizza from the Gap, then by all means, call up one of those places that keeps their product under heat lamps and guarantees delivery in 30 minutes or it's free.  But if you're looking for the Savile Row version of pizza, this is where you need to be.  

The pizza  arrives, toothsome and crisp, direct from their wood burning oven, made to order... bubbled and complete with a perfectly juuuuuust charred crust  This is the kind of mad genius that is essentially non-negotiable, because it's so eye-rollingly delicious.

One big downside is the parking situation.  I don't like being forced to use valet, no matter what the event \/ locale is.  I can understand limited parking in that part of town, but this is something that the other restaurants deal with w\/o making their patrons pay more.

So what you have to wait to eat here. It is well worth the wait. Bring a book, get here at three, enjoy a glass of wine at four when the bar opens next door, and enjoy your meal when you get in at five when the restaurant opens.
If you are too hungry, you can always get a bar snack at the bar Chris owns next door. all the choices are great. wonderful olives and yummy cheeses.

Anyhow, the restaurant is worth waiting to eat at. My brother and I wait the two or more hours a couple times a month if possible. We drive from over an hour and a half away to eat here. Although I must admit we have sandwiches at Pane Bianco for lunch, grocery shop, then come here for dinner.

ALL the pizzas are amazing. Although my favorites by far are the margherita- his homemade fresh mozzarella is to die for and the tomato sauce is amazing- and the bianco verde. love them both. and leftovers are a great welcome the next day when im back in the shitty little town i live in.

The antipasto appetizer is amazing as well. cant eat dinner here and not get that to start off with. the vegetables change every time I go. whatever is fresh at the farmers market they roast that day. then they add yummy cheese and meat and olives. mmmmm... im drooling thinking about it. my favorite is when they have jerusalem artichokes. wow. amazingly delicious! and there is a market salad that changes regularly as well. nice and refreshing.

I moved to AZ about two years ago and the one place all of my new coworkers told me I absolutely had to try was Pizzeria Bianco. After reading about it's rich history and lines that make people wait upwards of 3 hours for, I thought there had to be something of this legend and gave it a shot. My fiancee seemed more excited than I was because (as she constantly claims) she is a pizza fanatic with marinara sauce pumping through her veins.

We made the journey out about half an hour before they opened to ensure we wouldn't have to wait the customary amount of time and wasn't surprised to see a line of about fifteen more arrive soon after. We were the first to order and chose the WiseGuy pizza (onions, mozzarella, and sausage).

The first thing I noticed that seemed a little off putting was that there didn't seem to be a chef handling the pizza but a couple of simple line cooks. I played it off thinking it didn't matter much because how hard is it really to make a a pizza? The ingredients and recipe were going to be the stars of the show.

Even though we were the first to order we waited approximately thirty minutes before the pizza arrived. Again, I didn't think much of it at the time because in my mind, pizza of this legendary caliber was worth waiting for.

Once it finally arrived, we couldn't wait to dive in but I gave it a few moments to lessen the blow of any potential cheese burns seeing as it came fresh from the oven. My first bite was completely underwhelming. This pizza didn't have any flavor at all. The dough itself was very pleasing with a nice blend crispy and chewy textures but the cheese, onions, and sausage tasted of nothing. I never thought pizza could taste so bland. My fiancee shared the same sentiments. I thought she was joking at first and maybe I was being a little too critical but after one slice we stopped, paid our bill, and walked out of there.

I've never seen a place hyped so much that went completely in the opposite direction. There are much better places in AZ to get a great slice of pizza but for my money, Pizzeria Bianco isn't worth the time or effort.",2,0,0

We heard all of the horror stories of 2 to 3 hr long waits and to grab yourself a Bottle of Wine and prepare for a long night out....we didn't care and went out on a Monday night to give it a try.  To our surprise, there was NO WAIT at all, YEAH!!!!

We were immediately seated at a table (2 top) and given our menus.  It's very dark in the dining room and the menus were a little difficult to read in the ambient light....had to use our cell phone flashlight.  We decided to order:

Sonny Boy w\/Sausage

http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/pizzeria-bianco-phoenix?select=39b-Ufs5AEg-UJiR9u5qRg#39b-Ufs5AEg-UJiR9u5qRg

While we were waiting for our food they sat a table of 5 at the 4 top next to us....since the tables are so close, the back of the 5th person's chair was nearly touching our table...that kind of crept into our personal space and was a little uncomfortable.....especially since one of the girls in his party looked at us while getting seated and proclaimed ""It's his birthday, woo-hoo!!!"".....that's awesome and I hope you guys have a good time, but we came here to dine by ourselves and enjoy each other's company, not join a strangers birthday party....*ugh*...

Our Pizza came out a short time later.  I had the Sonny Boy w\/Sausage added.  I took one bite and instantly became a fan of their Pizza.  It was cooked perfectly with a nice thin crust.  The dough wasn't chewy or undercooked....it was just right.  The Sausage had good flavor and the Pepperoni didn't overwhelm the Pizza.

The Better Half had the Bianco Verde w\/Prosciutto.  When it came out, it was covered in Greens....LOL, it looked pretty hilarious as I've never seen a Pizza that looked like this before.  It tasted pretty good though.  I had a slice and thought it would suck because of all of the greens on it....it's not something I would personally order, but my Wife enjoyed it and said she'd order it again.

The service here was pretty good.  The server was pleasant, friendly, and attentive.  I'm not sure the Pizza is worth a 2 or 3 hr wait, but it's pretty good.  We'd come back on another slow night.

The small restaurant, with about 12 tables crammed inside one room serves up a variety of pizzas, as well as salads and  a couple appetizers. The antipasto plate ($13) was fine, with a couple pieces of cheese, olives, peppers, a frittata and salami, but it wasn't any better than what I've had at my current favorite downtown Phoenix pizza place, Cibo.

In fact, Cibo beat Bianco in pizza quality (Cibo doesn't burn the edges) and in wait time. My party of four waited more than an hour for a table at Bianco's, and I don't think I've ever waited more than 30 minutes at Cibo on a busy Friday or Saturday night.

I ordered a margherita pizza topped with olives ($15), and I did enjoy the thin, soft middle of the pizza. It was similar in taste and portion size to Cibo but had that not-so-appetizing burnt crust.

The atmosphere at Bianco's was bare bones, and it was way too loud in the place to be considered romantic. Cibo, on the other hand, offers a gorgeous patio and a quieter setting.

I liked that Pizzeria Bianco was in the historic downtown area and was close to several bars, including the Rose and Crown Pub (628 E. Adams St.), but in the future I'll stick with Cibo for a quality pizza fix.",2,0,1

We ended up ordering the Margherita, Rosa, Biancoverde, and Wiseguy pizzas. The Margherita and especially the Biancoverde were quite good and light. The Rosa and Wiseguy were very salty and oily. I wouldn't order them again. Still, the meal felt satisfying. 

Pizzeria Bianco reminds me very much of Basic in San Diego; both places have the floppy, slightly charred, thin-crust pizzas, the rugged brick walls, the wood burning oven. But Basic has no wait, better hours, a full bar, cheaper pizza pies, and more toppings to choose from.

The sum of the elements in this restaurant (most average at best) have combined to create a reputation that far exceeds the actual product.  The menu is quite limited, even more so for lunch.  Your choices are pizza or a salad.  But be warned, the salad (at least during lunch) is simply a pile of chopped romaine lettuce with red onions.  Ah, but the pizza...  Is it a New York style, maybe a touch of Chicago style?  Big beautiful slices of pizza loaded with fresh toppings?  Not quite.  Picture Martha Stewart on a diet tasked with making a pizza only with the ingredients from her back yard.  Sure, you get this nice looking crust made right before your eyes, then a very modest sprinkinling of toppings and any sauce.  Very modest.  Essentially for $16.00 you get pizza crust with some ""wood roasted onion"", a few slivers of fennel sausage, and a hint of mozarella....just a hint mind you.  No sauce, nothing else.  The crust is fine, average, much better crust at Upper Crust or Grimaldis.  The toppings are sparce, is it how he prepares the ""wood roasted onion?""  Why do people line up for hours for this?  

Much has to do with people wanting to seem more cultured or sophisticated than they really are and Chris Bianco has really catered to this.  Small restaurant with maybe 10 tables at best, no reservations...this creates lines and people tend to believe where a line ends is ""the"" place to be.  Must make the menu seem to appeal to the sophisticated pallet...check.  Small servings at a high price...check.  Parade around the kitchen so your customers can shower you with praise for making such incredible wood roasted onions.....check.  

If you find yourself in the mood to eat a big piece of over priced pizza crust with a few items from Martha Stewart's garden tossed on there, you may want to give this place a shot.  The lines are wonderful there and just being seen at this establishment will make you more hip.  Or you can save your money and time, go to the store, get a boboli crust and throw on an onion, rosemary, and pine nuts.  Voila, you have a Bianco pizza.  Add a side salad, go buy the bagged romaine and dump it on the plate, boom, Bianco salad!  Impress your neighbors with your level of sophistication when you tell them its Bianco.

We drove there separately and surprise - now they offer FREE valet parking (of course tip the valet dude).  Our quoted wait time for a table was 1.5 hours, and apparently this was nothing compared to the wait my friends had to deal with before (3+ hours).  

We spent time next door at the bar by ordering a bottle of wine and a cheese plate to share and before we knew it, the wait was over.

Although the restaurant isn't big (and we were almost friends with the tables next to us just because it was so snug in there), there was a nice ambiance - especially with the huge woodfire oven in the back.  

We ordered two Caprese salads and three pizzas - the Margherita, Wiseguy, and Biancoverde (we added roasted tomato slices to the Biancoverde for an extra charge).  O.M.G. - the food was SO good!  Everything tasted fresh and delicious.  I'm usually not a fan of pizzas with thin crusts, but these were awesome.

Apparently they make their own mozzarella, which is probably why their Caprese salad ($9) is one of the best (if not the best) I've had thus far.  The tomatoes and mozzarella were sliced thick and tasted SO fresh, the basil was fragrant - and EVOO - YUM! 

The Magherita pizza was $12 and the other two were $16 each.  Our food came within 15-20 mins after we placed our order, and boy - the pizzas were so fragrant!  They were decently sized and were enough to feed our group of six ladies.  The Margherita and Biancoverde tasted good, but my fave was the Wiseguy, which was topped with thick slices of roasted onions, mozzarella, and thick slices of fennel sausage.  The sausage tasted a bit too sweet, but overall, each bite of the pizza slice was food nirvana.

My friend ordered a Wiseguy to go, so the bill (2 salads + 4 pizzas) came to $88, and we added a 20% tip to that.  Was the food worth the total bill?  Yes!  Will I come here again?  Yes!",0,0,1

Space is small and accommodates parties of 1 - 4 quite comfortably not too sure if I would recommend for larger groups. Located just a block away from Chase Field, Mr W and I decided to partake in some wood fired pizza and wine before the game. Meetings had us running behind so we missed the first two innings of the game but I think that was a benefit for us because we were able to grab a seat at the bar without the wait. We had a perfect view of the brick oven and the courtyard of the square. 
We shared the tomato, mozzarella and basil salad. The tomatoes were firm and sweet and the basil was garden fresh. The olive oil is what really brought all the Flavors together on this simple but delicious dish. We also shared a bottle of 2011 Toscana recommended by the bartender whose name, sadly, has slipped my mind. We ordered the white sauce pizza ( Biancoverde ) and it was really good! Garlic flavored and topped with arugula. We had asked to add mushrooms and prosciutto both did not make it on to our pizza however, the prosciutto was brought to us on the side and it was deli delicious! 
We were so deep into conversation and even offered a glass of wine from our bottle to the bartender ( he happily joined us in and out of moments as he worked ) that we hated having to leave but our seat for the game were calling. 
I would say this dining experience was quite lovely, but I would have loved to try the pizza with the mushrooms and prosciutto incorporated. Also, prices are on the higher side so I am having to give Bianco's a 4 star ""better than most"" wood fired review!",4,2,3

There was already a good size crowd waiting to get in. We were seated right away and service was fairly quick (total lunch took about an hour, not too bad for sit-down service). 

Since it was a work lunch, we couldn't have any beer or wine. they have 3 options: Coke, diet Coke or sweet tea (all bottles). No fountain drinks at all. That was fine by me, water is cheaper. It is worth noting that the beer they have on tap (Thunder Head or something ) is REALLY tasty and VERY hard to find anywhere else. It's available next door at Bar Bianco.

They only have 6 pizza options and 6 additional topping options. If you want fruit or something on your pizza, you better go somewhere else, because that's not what they do. 

I had the Rosa pizza, with parmegiano reggiano, red onions and pistachios. it was quite good, but not amazing. Two friends had the margherita pizza and one had the one with fennel sausage. One friend LOVED his margherita pizza but hated mine; I had a piece of his and thought it was bland. The guy who had the sausage pizza found it to be so-so. I always thought they got a little crazy with the sausage. It's pretty strong tasting stuff, you should go easy on it.

After lunch, don't expect dessert. They don't have any. They do have a huge coffee machine, so you can have your espresso or cappuccino. 

If you come at dinner time, be prepared to wait. You can make reservations for 6 or more, but you have to do that weeks in advance. 

Honestly, no matter what you've heard, this is NOT the best pizza in the Valley. La Grande Orange does it as well or better, plus they have more topping options and are more than happy to give you a half and half pizza. This place is a little snooty. My friend had a salad and wanted to add the fennel sausage to it (he's on a protein diet). They said the sausage is for the pizza only! Really??

So, if you really want to try it, go right ahead and make up your own mind. Maybe come at lunch time. Not nearly as busy and it has all the same food (unlike Cibo, which has a different menu at dinner). But you would probably be happier at Cibo or La Grande Orange. Both make awesome pizza with more options and are way more friendly about it.",1,0,0

My expectations may have been too high. Our party of four went for a late lunch, we did not have to wait for a table. 

My fiance and I decided to try 2 pies, the margherita and the Biancoverde. The Margherita pie came out quite dry, not with the wonderful chewy crust that a great margherita should have... however, the Biancoverde, a white pizza with Ricotta and arugala, was fantastic! Incredible flavors, the extra toppings kept this pie perfectly moist and delicious, it was really quite perfect. 
Unfortunately, we had a hair in one of our pizzas, however, that's only part of the reason for the mediocre rating... 
The hair, the 1-2 star margherita, and the non-existant meat selection I can only give a 3 star rating... (I'm a bit of a carnivore, I need more meat!)

My first recommendation is avoid the valet parking and park on Monroe street one street north. There is always parking on Monroe and it saves you the 3 dollars plus the tip I'm always obligated to do when dealing with valet services. The pizza is wonderful but it can be a bit pricey.

3. does the owner want to keep it small despite the negative experience for MANY people who have to wait for forever or just don't go because they don't want the hassle?

I was so happy to show up and see plenty of seats for me to choose from at the bar. Hallelujah, let's see what the fuss is all about. I had a tasty coke from a bottle (I'm rarely a caffeine drinker) and ordered the Margherita after debating whether to go red or white. 5 minutes after I ordered the friendly waitress told another customer at the bar that you could split the pizza and do half and half for yourself. Wish I woulda known!

I decided to bring my family to this restaurant since I had been there before and I wanted to share the great experience I had two years ago. We walked in, and I was told it would be a 30-40 minute wait, which was ok since I knew it was popular. What it turned out to be was an hour wait while watching other parties that came later being seated. My mother attempted to ask politely what was the problem, and the front person said that she had told me that we would be seated in an hour. I kept on seeing other parties, regardless of size, coming in and being seated before us. When no one else could be seated and we could visibly see from outside that there were openings, we were finally seated. 

It almost felt like discrimination since everyone else was Caucasian and my family is Chinese. Any Caucasian party that went it was seated almost immediately. Why did we stay? Because it would have felt like losing if we had left. 

When we finally ate, the servers were good while that hostess avoid my table like a plague and would refill other people's water but ours.

The food was excellent. We ordered the following:

Tomato mozzarella salad: thick slices of tomato and mozzarella drenched on olive oil and basil. An excellent starter
Spiedini: skewers of hot prosciutto wrapped around Italian fontina cheese over a bed of arugula. We wished there was one more to savor!
Marinara - excellent thin crust with a nice light tomato sauce. Only gripe is I wish there was more basil
Biancoverde - excellent white pizza with argula. A very good and refreshing pizza
Wiseguy: white pizza with sausage and onions, the favorite of the meal. One thing I wished I did was add mushrooms.

The restaurant itself is pretty cozy and they do not have a bunch of tables which leads to a fairly intimate experience. The menu here is pretty small. I ended up getting a wise guys pizza which has sausage with fennel , onions and cheese and no sauce. I normally do not care for white pizza but this one was superb.

I've never had a Yelp account, but Pizzeria Bianco was so bad tonight I had to write one.  I don't know if the pizza is any good, after 3 hours of rude service and the bartender next door mumbling under her breath at us we confronted the manager, were called trash by her, and told to ""Go back to Scottsdale""....  I don't even live in Scottsdale!!!

It all began when my girlfriend made reservations for a party of 4 last month for my birthday.  She showed up early at 5:45 with a birthday cake for me from AJ's and asked if they could keep the cake cool until we were seated.  The hostess flat out told her no, the bartender next door was nicer and obliged after a bit of a coaxing.  Then, after ordering a bottle of red wine my girlfriend asked for a red wine glass (larger) to drink out of instead of the chardonnay glass she was handed.  The female bartender told her sorry, they were all out, even though we had ordered a bottle of wine.  Not 3 minutes later a man walked up who must have been a regular because of his and the bartender's familiarity and lo and behold, she found 4 red wine glasses when he ordered a bottle and promised to push more through the dishwasher!!!! Now that's service, just not for us.....

We then ordered multiple appetizers and waited.  And waited....  

After we tired of eating the bread, cheese, olives, and other apps we had the bright idea that we could perhaps eat the birthday cake first and that would hold us over until our actual dinner, which was still an hour away according to the rude hostess.  When we asked the bartender if we could have some plates for the cake she curtly replied no, that they had no plates and silverware on the bar side and we couldn't eat there anyway because they would take away the restaurant's food license if they allowed food not prepared on premisis to be served at Pizzeria Bianco.  Funny, but Banderas had no qualms serving us my birthday cake later when we left fed up with the bad service and wait.  I suppose restaurants are held to lower standards than pizzerias.

When my sister's friend said we'd eat it outside on the park benches and started merely cutting the cake into slices at the almost empty bar using a dull cheese knife (empty except for us and two other people) the bartender rudely told her that she couldn't cut the cake at the bar because this was also against the law and Bianco policy.  Really?  A waitress reiterated this and when my sister's friend asked to see this policy on cake the waitress replied ""We can't write every policy down!!!""  Again, seriously???

We went next door and sat on one of the 3 (three!!!) empty tables outside the actual restaurant with the cake when a server told us we couldn't be there.  We told her we had been on a wait list since about 5:45 (it was 8:40 at the time) and she showed me our name and the time 9:20 next to our names.  I then complained that my poor girlfriend had been there for 4 hours and the manager became very confrontational, saying no one had been waiting that long and getting very huffy about it!  (admittedly, I was wrong, we'd only been there a mere 3 hours!!!) I then asked her what the long wait was about and she motioned at my friends sister, who had said something sarcastic to the bartender next door when my girlfriend was filling out the tip on our tab, admittedly.  My sister's friend had told my girlfriend not to leave a tip because of the rude bartender to which the bartender naively said ""Really? But I've been soooooo nice to you!!!"" My sister's friend then said something along the lines of ""Honey, if that's you being nice I don't want to see you when you're angry.""

Back to the patio area outside Bianco, a server had called the manager who came out very confrontational and angry, asking if there was a problem.  I noted the long wait time and she said that my girlfriend was welcome back any time because she had behaved nicely but that the rest of us were trash and should ""Go Back to Scottsale"".  I have never been angrier or more shocked at the service, attitude, or general lack of tact by a restaurant.  I was a server for 3 years during college, had much worse behavior by customers and still managed to be calm and understanding when they had a complaint.  The staff at Biancos's?  No chance.  They acted as if we were lucky to have the privilege to wait three plus hours for the chance to eat their sacred pizza and we should shut up and accept however they wished to treat us.  
Maybe the pizza is phenomenal, I don't know.  All I know is that we left and went to Banderas where the waitress told us she'd had different customers with similar complaints about the service at Pizzeria Bianco who left and came to Banderas.  She also told us the long wait times were engineered by Bianco to ensure we spend time next door buying wine and appetizers, which are higher profit items than the pizza.  I don't know if that's true, but it might explain why we weren't seated at 8:40.",6,1,2

An Avant-garde, trendy, Modern establishment with the BEST damn pizza under the sun. Think of going to Pizzeria Bianco as an ""experience"" not just  ""getting dinner"". 
Expect long waits on most days if you don't want to get there early enough to be seated immediately. There's a wine bar next door where you will find yummy cheese platters and vino. Which means you can sip and snack while you wait in line. Give yourself about 3 hours for the entire experience and after making a reservation check out the pub just across the way, (if you have to wait a while). They have great beer, my favorite onion rings, a pool table, and indoor-outdoor seating (just be sure to keep checking back to make sure you don't get passed up!)

We knew this was something that absolutely had to be done before leaving or we could potentially regret it for eternity. It was now our last Saturday so why not go out with a bang-Bianco it is. We got there around 4:30 knowing based on Martha Stewart and most importantly, YELP reviewers, that we would be in for a long evening. First there was the 40 minute wait to get the name on the list. Once that phase was over we found a lovely piece of real estate at Bar Bianco to plant ourselves for what they said would be a 4 hour wait. Our party of 3 began with 1 bottle of wine, then 2 and then.....yep it had been 4 hours and we checked with the host Nazi who said it would be another hour...so...why not add a 3rd bottle of wine to the tab.. WOW 

By this time we were pretty faded and so extremely excited to dive into the pies. 
The food was astounding, service was great but the 5 hour wait was a little extreme for food. 

We did it right-we had the right company, we didn't go into the experience hungry, and we enjoyed bar Bianco. 

It really is a 'must do' when in Phoenix but I doubt it would be my regular spot since it isn't often that I have 6 spare hours (more with travel) to devote to a meal. But, for what it was, it was delectable.",3,1,1

They have one tiny lot that depending on when you go may or may not be valet only.  Since there was no other option,  we used the valet. Three dollars to watch him park our car literally fifteen feet from where we stopped. Bizzare. And then there are your fellow diners. Lots of Ed Hardy wearing dudebros when we were there.

I don't get the hype over this place???  The only possible reason this place has anything better than an ""A-OK' review is people must be too embarrassed to give it a honest review after they just waited 2-3 hrs for a below average pizza.  And I use the word pizza with hesitation...what they serve is far from any definition of pizza.

We had been wanting to try this place for a while and since the line into the NFL Experience was crazy long we thought, hey, lets go sit in line at Pizzeria Bianco, based on all the ""talk"" we ought to come out with smiles on our face and satisfied bellies.  If we are going to wait ""in line"" for hours on a Saturday, lets do it there instead.

First, the wait is loooong, we completely expected that.  We were actually relieved when we got there and it was only 1 1\/2 hours.  We went over to the little house next door where the waiting takes place and bellied up to the bar (which has about 6 chairs).  Now, if you are a ""regular Joe"" (hey I make over 100k a year but I still view myself as an average person), you like the normal beer selection (Bud, Coors, Stella, Blue Moon), you get the drift.  The ONLY beer that was recognizable was Tecate.  The rest, never heard of them!  And, you can pay upwards of $10.00 for a beer while you wait for your typical 2-3 hours.  I also favor wine but I cannot part ways with my hard-earned money and justify $20.00 for a glass of vino.  So in essence, lets make everyone wait for no less than 1 1\/2 hours to get in and lets bend them over with our drink prices and unrecognizable selections.

As I mentioned, it was the day before Super Bowl so the ""big names"" were all over the place downtown.  Unless you are a celebrity, you are going to wait at this place.  Yes, we sat at watched as the ""celebrities"" and ""A-listers"" walked in the door with their followers (8-10 people in tow) approached the hostess and somehow got seated in front of people that had already been waiting their turn for well over an hour and a half!!  We had a great window seat right up front and yes, we did only wait for 1 1\/2 hours and yes, we saw this happen a few times.  We noticed when we were seated that not only is this place very small but there were several open tables big and small so the managements choice to only seat a limited few or to keep tables purposely available for whom they deem to be VIP's, well enough said.  

The menu, completely unimpressive!  Again, being an ""average Joe"" I like toppings on my pizza or at least a ""normal"" choice of typical, expected toppings.  There was nothing tempting about any of the limited pre-selected topping pizzas on the menu.  We ordered and added mushrooms.

We were pretty hungry and looked over the so-called salads and again, there was hardly anything that came on the salads and the prices - crazy!  We saw one being delivered next to us and our mouths dropped when we saw a big plate with a little lettuce, certainly not a $10.00 salad any place I've ever been.  Can you say rip-off???!!!

Finally, the moment of truth, the pizza arrived.  Do you remember they saying ""Where's the Beef""?  Yes, we were asking ""Where the hell is the $18.00 pizza with the $3.00 in extra toppings we ordered""????  

Pizza crust, there was none.  I regularly make pizza on my grill and let me tell you, MY pizza on the grill made from scratch has a beautiful crusty edge.  Not only was the crust lacking, the thin, no paper-thin bottom was tasteless, yes, completely tasteless, like a saltine cracker without the salt.  As for the so-called toppings, they were non-existent!  I carefully tore off one small piece and what do you know, not one piece of cheese was on my sliver of pizza.  Not only would a little cheese been nice but it would have helped to secure what limited a toppings I did get to stick to the pizza.  Every time I took a bite everything fell to my plate.  Our selection was to have come with salami and guess what, that was lacking on my piece as well.  The olives, tasteless!  The only thing on the whole pizza that had flavor were the extra mushrooms we requested that too failed to make the whole pizza.

We sat and collectively decided right away that this place is ALL HYPE and no substance and certainly, not worth the hours of waiting or the price!  So ignore all the hype you read, somebody's getting paid off to write the A+ ratings or perhaps, THEY ARE BEING PUSHED TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE, each and every time they frequent this place. 

Save yourself the time and money and get a much better pizza, go to Grimaldi's (fantastic pizza every time).   I highly suggest Sauce (several locations in the valley) for a pizza that is made the same way and 100% better taste.  Their salads are priced the same and you can actually make a meal of them.

If getting into this place and eating here is on your Bucket List of life, erase it and go somewhere.

Yes, that's the story to this place. Man grows up in Brooklyn, falls in love with Arizona, moves himself to said Arizona, opens a pizza place and BOOM! You have Pizzeria Bianco.

So being from NY, and after hearing much hype about this place and how, according to one NY Times critic, it could be even BETTER than NY pizza, I HAD TO HAD TO try this place.

First off, let me start by saying that for an out-of-towner, this place was quite hard to find! It was facing the street but within a closed restaurant square just outside of Arizona U. Considering that we were driving and didn't know the area, we drove around and around the area a few times before we decided to just park the car and take it by foot. After parking the car and putting approx 8 quarters in a meter that robbed us of 20 minutes (max 2 hrs but we were prepping for the long wait that is also associated with this place), we walked only to find a parking lot right next to the restaurant. Grrrrr.... Lucky for us, we went on an off hour and had no trouble getting a seat.

Next up, upon walking in we noticed that the place was teeny! No wonder they have such a long wait!!! I know that they're pizza was modeled after old recipes, but did they're structure have to model the old tiny places that the old NY pizza joints are also known for? I'd say no... So anyway, we sit, get a menu and are a bit thrown off by the prices considering the sizes of the pies in front of other patrons. $18 for a personal sized pie with only sausage on top??! Whatever... By this time we were a bit perturbed but fully committed. We paid our meter, lost the money, were seated, hungry and extremely curious about what all the hype was about. So bam... $18 gone for a little pie w\/ fresh sausage on top. I swear this better be good!!

About 10 minutes after ordering we received our pizza, fresh from the brick-burning oven with cheese melting and sausage steaming. Looked good; smelled good... damn better taste good too! We stared at the pizza for a while as we tried to soak in the size vs price and come to terms with the absurdity of it, took our slice and took a bite...

The suspense as we chewed, absorbed and swallowed. Was it even better than NYC pizza? Was it deserving of all the hype from Oprah and Diane Sawyer? Did it deserve to have up to 3 hour waits? Answer: No. As a New Yorker who has tried many of the old greats (Grimaldi's, Lombardi's, John's, Joe's, etc.), and even some of the newer ones (Pulino's), the answer was a definite No. And my goodness man who wrote the review in the New York Times, were you really being honest or did you just have a connection? That said, for Arizona, it was definitely fantastic. In fact, for the nation, it definitely falls into my top 10 pizza places within the U.S. Will I be back? Most likely not. I have my fill of NY pizza when I'm actually in NY, and I can't seem to swallow paying $18 for a pie that I could honestly finish myself on a good day. Will you regret it if you visit Pizzeria Bianco? I'd say almost definitely not.",2,1,1

Went first on a Tuesday night.  We were told the wait would be 2 hours, so we decided to go to Nobua instead.  We went back on Thursday night around 9PM and were able to get in with just a 20 minute wait. 

I LOVE neapolitan style pizza.  Here in Dallas, I go to Cavalli's on a regular basis and love it.  I knew I would love Bianco, the big question is would I think it is the ""best pizza in America""?

It might be.  Honestly, any certified Neapolitan pizza place is going to be nearly as good as Bianco.  It's not rocket science, it's just the right oven and the right ingredients and the right touch.  However, I will say Bianco might do it a touch better than the rest. 

The crust is amazing.  It's perfectly done, with just enough burnt on the edges for my taste.  I ate every piece of edge there was, which is unusual for me.  (I tend to leave some crust edge.)  The toppings are perfect, the Sopprasata was amazing, the fennel sausage was great, the sauce was perfect. 

It's basically the perfect pizza.  Yet, I was kind of disappointed.  It made me realize that I've tasted the best pizza out there and it is only slightly better than some local places.  I guess I should look at it in a good way, that I can drive 10 minutes and get an amazing pizza at Cavalli any day of the week, a pizza that rivals the best in America.",0,0,0

It's a true gem in Phoenix, a place you need to visit if you're on vacation or if you're a local

My Overall Rating - 4  1\/2 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)

Atmosphere - Pizzeria Bianco is in a beautiful brick building.  There is outdoor seating, and during the sunset the building lights up and it creates a great atmosphere.  Be warned, it's small so expect a long wait during busy times.  Inside you should make your way over to view wood fired brick oven, wear fresh pizzas are baked in minutes. 1 Star.

Service - We visited on an early Sunday evening, and they were certainly busy.  We chose to sit outside in the beautiful Phoenix outdoors.  The staff was very accommodating to our large group.  It was slow at times, but I'm pretty sure that's due to their popularity.  Nonetheless it was a good experience.  1 Star.

Food - If you're a fan of Neapolitan pizza, Pizzeria Bianco will not disappoint.  This style of pizza uses freshly tossed dough to create a thin crust that gets baked in about a minute in their oven.  The result is a pizza that's pure in taste and allows the toppings to star.  Our choices included the Biancoverde - a white pizza with prosciutto and the Wiseguy - sausage & caramelized onions.  If you're a fan of prosciutto you'll love it.  The caramelized onions on the wiseguy were sweet and fit well with the sausage.  I even ordered a latte after seeing an espresso machine.  Even that was good.  It's some of the best Neapolitan style pizza I've had.  2 Stars.

Will I Return? - Probably not.  While the pizza is superb, you do have to fight the crowds.  Pizzeria Bianco is not the only Neapolitan style pizzeria I've been to.  It's great though, and is worth a visit if you've never been. 1\/2 Stars.

My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):
1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.
1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.
2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.
1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. 

Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.",13,10,11

Prices seemed kinda steep but for the best pizza in the world I would pay double. My party of 3 and I are very excited about this pizza until it arrives at our table.

It is no wonder it consistently makes number one on the Zagat's (clearing throat, then spit) list. It should be taught as an example in Economics 101. How could seating for 30 at a time translate into a nationally famous restaurant?

Before I get to the nitty, let me make my disclaimer so all you potential flamers can chill and just move on your merry way.
I don't wait. I want a reservation. I prefer an invitation by my host with RSVP. Bianco's is yet another example of our consumer need to suffer (see review of Los Dos) ""Seinfeld-style"" -- if you haven't seen the Chinese restaurant episode, you've got to; you can easily satisfy your need for suffering and you don't even have to leave your couch or wander far from your clicker.

I love Bianco's pizza. It truly reminds me of eating in Naples and what pizza is like from that region. I mean before their landfills filled up -- DON'T go to Naples now. There is no other place in Phoenix to taste this kind of pizza. I just wish someone could execute it better -- his wife?

Oh wait. I forgot; it already is the hottest restaurant in town. Why would they change a fantastically successful equation? Consumers consume. You want to find out why you have to wait 3 hours. You want to do it yourself. So does every tourist coming here to be surprised that Phoenix actually has paved roads and that we drive cars on them. They've booked their jeep tours from their suburban cookie-cutter somewhere far away, but don't realize that it's an hour drive to the desert. Yeah, you know that was you.

Do I have to remind you that you have to arrive at Bianco's an hour before the restaurant even opens to wait in line to put your name on the list to then wait next door for 3 hours to get a table? You will still have to wait because large parties get to eat ahead of you. I have to wonder. Would this place be so famous if they had seating for 100-120 like most other successful dining rooms around town? Would folks still flock there to spend their ENTIRE evening waiting for a table?

I'll wait and see. I've already fulfilled my duty as consumer and subjected myself to the suffering that is Bianco's. I've done it. What's next? Who's going to provide my next packaged-up roller-coaster ride? Come on. Tell me! Are we there yet? Yet?",9,13,8

How was the pizza???It was good, but I can get good pizza without the wait. Thing is I feel that what they have going is that the wait leaves people starving, so you might be able to serve wonder bread with tomato sauce, it just might be the best thing you have ever had.

My conclusion is that this place is a phenomenon, that it lives on hype and a 3 hour wait for pizza, that you have to convince yourself the wait was worth it and its the best pizza that you have ever had.  Sorry all, just cannot join in on the hype, just to make myself feel better.",2,5,1

I was fortunate enough to be in town on a Monday for lunch, so I did not experience the legendary long wait times.  I was able to get a seat at the bar immediately.  I ordered the Sonny Boy pizza, which is analogous to an upscale pepperoni pizza.  It had tomato sauce, their house made mozzarella, sopressata (spicy Italian salami) and some fancy olives.  

Getting the crust right is the first order of business for a great pizza place and Bianco does not disappoint.  It was baked to perfection.  The crust was stretched thin.  The rim (cornicone) was puffed up just the right amount and the underside had the perfect amount of charring; not burned, just baked correctly.  There was no ""gum line"" to be found anywhere in the crust and the end of the pizza droops just the right amount.  The crust wasn't a cardboard biscuit, nor was it floppy\/soupy.  It had the right amount of structure and chew.  

You really know that you've eaten a great pizza when it begins to taste even better as you approach the end of the pizza.

As much as I'm gushing over the crust, I will say that I've come to prefer the flavor of naturally leavened dough (sourdough) for pizza.  I think that the crust could be even better if he made the move to natural leavening, but that's just my preference.

The sopressata was spicy, but not overly so, not was it too salty.  The sauce was simple and tasty and I'm in love with their cheese.

Looking at the food on the tables of other patrons it's apparent that their produce is among the most beautiful I've ever laid eyes on.  I've never seen tomatoes that red or arugula that green, etc.

Everyone that I meet is telling me about this goo goo gaga pizza restaurant down in Phoenix called, Pizzeria Bianco.  So I finally decided (after living in Phoenix for 2 years and some time) to go check out this crib out.  

My first impression walking into this house was wow it's nice and cozy.  The hostess was very attentive and gave me a smiling greeting (that doesn't make sense but deal with it).  She said it would be a 20 min wait and I was in shock.  People were telling me that the waiting list was usually 1-2 hours, sometimes 3.  But let me tell you a little secret.  People are dumb and they go eat out on a Thurs-Sat nights.  Guess what people do on those nights?  They go eat out... SOOO to give you some advice, go eat out on a mon, tues, or wed and stop complaining about the wait time.

Well I ordered a margarita pizza and some sparkling water.  The pizza came out and I didn't go wooo lala or WOW amazing or 0_0.  It's only a pizza.  I took the first bite and it tasted like good pizza.  That's the only thing it tastes like... good pizza.  So I don't understand why people go crazy over this place.  It's only pizza..

The past few times we've been in the area and have stopped by here, it's been an hour or more wait, and I'm just too impatient to do so. Even the place next door for waiting gets too crowded as well!  This time, we planned it well... after getting breakfast at Gallo Blanco, we figured... hey, we're in the area, why not get some pizzas to go. Yeah, I know... I know... they don't do pizzas to go unless you eat there, so, as gluttinous as it sounds. We ate pizza right after breakfast!

We did it right this time. We arrived around 10am this lovely humid Saturday morning. No one was in their parking lot. Uh-oh, our timing was too good. We wandered off to the Arizona Science Center to chill (literally it was freezing in there) and then came back around 10:40am, and still no people waiting out front. The first family came around 10:45 and at the same time Bianco's brought the valet stand out. A few minutes later, more and more people came pulling up. So, 10am's too early. I'd say about 10:39am would be just right to park, sit in the air conditioning for awhile and then stroll up to the door at 10:48 and then even though there's a short line, you'll still get a table!

We ate the Margherita (tomato sauce and cheese was wholesome and good. Very light on the basil this time) and the Wise Guy (sausage was excellent on this one) pizzas there. They're about 12"" size pizzas which are good for individual pizzas especially since the crust isn't exactly thick. Everything is really light... the crust, the toppings, the sauce. No feeling of oiliness at the end, because everything is ""just right.""  We ate the Rosa and Sonny Boy at home. The Rosa is very unique and delicious because it has both Rosemary potatoes and pistachios on it. I loved this one and am still crushing on it! The Sonny Boy is definitely for the olive lovers, because the olive taste is so strong! All pizzas had the fresh, light, brick oven taste. Is it the best pizza in the country as legend has it? Although I did love these pizzas, I can't reach a verdict because it's different. I don't know what to compare it to. La Piazza Al Forno was still this same type of thin gourmet pizza, yet the Al Forno cheeses were just so oily and rich and filling. Amaro Pizzeria and Vino Lounge has pizzas that also reminded me of Pizzeria Bianco's. All I know is...

We ordered the sonny boy and the wise guy. Great combinations and the topping to sauce to crust ratio is pretty on point. If you're looking for saucy, doughy pizza oozing cheese this is not for you. You get a delicate crust with light cheese which is the way I prefer it.

I was unimpressed with the crust though... Parts of it was too burnt to be edible. 

Overall their menu was too limited to be satisfactory. Two pizzas was too much for two people, but the salads were boring and the appetizer were scarce in options.

Wow, getting permission to make an additional order?  We were so disappointed.  I'm sure your neighborhood pizza joint is much better and will appreciate your business.",0,0,0

We stopped in around 2:30 inthe afternoon. No Wait! I couldn't even believe it. I hadn't eaten there since I was a little girl, but it was just as good as I remember.

We got a couple beers and split the Margarita Pizza. It was sooo yummy! Perfectly crispy on the edges and lots of flavor. The service was a tini bit slow, but no big deal, we loved it. 

If you want great pizza and dont want to wait the normal 3 hours during dinner, you should hit up Pizzaria Bianco while the sun is still up, less wait time if at all.

People get in line 2 hours before they open for dinner. They are not open for lunch. It is not unusual for  patrons to wait 3-4 hours for a table. 

I usually go to a restaurant when I am hungry.  The concept of waiting  hours to eat while you are hungry escapes me.  Having said that, it is certainly not the fault of Bianco's for being so popular.  It's their choice not to take reservations. It's my choice not to patronize a place that does not take reservations.

My dilemna is Bianco's is unique and I like their food.  Basically, we are talking about a pizza joint.  But you just need to observe Bianco himself at the brick oven, making his fabulous pizzas, and you will get it.  You are watching something special, an artist at work.

The margherita was almost everything it's supposed to be: super thin crust, blisters from the wood burning oven, house made sauce wonderfully balanced, house made fresh mozzarella that tasted wonderful and garden fresh basil. I could easily forgive them for not crisping the crust so that it would hold up the toppings. It's a rule: one never finds really crispy crusts (ie, burnt) outside of NY. But it allowed the crust to assert itself in taste. And tasty it was. 

But the best thing about Pizzeria Bianco is the fellowship that it engenders with the people who gladly wait hours to get a seat in this small restaurant. Judging from the other yelpers, there are exceptions, but I had great conversations with my fellow diners at the bar and the service was wonderful. I got on line about 45 minutes before the opening at 5pm on a Tuesday. There were only about 17 people in front of me and the folks who followed, happily got in line behind me.

Unfortunately, my answer is ""no.""

Why not?

1. I love thin crust pizza, but for me, this was a little too thin. I enjoy a little chew in the crust; my pizza was more cracker-like.

2. I wish there were more varieties of pizza on the menu.

I have NO idea how this passed through my filters as I was searching for good eats on my vacation. Luckily for me, I have a friend who ""stalks"" celebrities online and somehow came upon a picture of Jimmy Fallon eating here. In short, thanks to my stalking friend, I found a great gem in Phoenix!

We came here at around 7pm on New Year's Day and were met with a 2 hour wait. Not surprising, but we were hungry. Luckily for us, they have a holding area next door with small bites and drinks. We ordered a few appetizers: marinated olives, a cheese plate, and the crostini plate. Standard apps and nothing to write home about. The crostini with the goat cheese was our favorite. We passed the time with a game of Scrabble. They have other games floating around the place.

Before we knew it, our name was called and we were ready for dinner. The place is small and could probably fit 40-50 people max. It was darkly lit, but felt warm and inviting. 

For 6 ladies, we ordered 2 salads and 4 pizzas to share. The crust is crisp and the wood fire creates this amazing smoky flavor. 

Margherita with prosciutto - great sauce and well balanced flavors. One of my favorites that night. 

The Rosa - red onion, pistachios, and parm - interesting combo and a must try. Really tasty!

wise guy - onions and sausage. I was surprised I didn't like this as much. It was a little sweeter than I'd like. The flavors just didn't do it for me.

Sonny Boy - tomato sauce, salami, and olives - good, but totally nothing super special.

Overall, I'd say the pizzas are tasty! The wait is crazy, but worth it if you're visiting. I probably wouldn't wait here for 2 hours if I lived in the area. The dough\/crust is something worth mentioning though and I'd play around with the different toppings to get something that suits your taste buds.",0,0,0

This is a TINY place with a LONG wait..... so if you just want a regular old pizza in a couple minutes, you wont be happy visiting this restaurant. This restaurant is quite famous and everyone has wonderful things to say about it so I had to try it and put in my 2 cents. 

I met a co-worker here one Friday evening (pretty busy) and I have to say that I was blown away! We were able to get a small table outside and enjoy a bottle of wine from next door, as we waited for a table. If you're not in a rush and enjoying your company, the wait of 45-60 minutes shouldn't be a problem. As we were seated, yes you notice that you are a little crammed but if you can get over that fact and enjoy a quant little authentic different place to eat you will enjoy yourself. 

The pizza is cooked brick oven style, has thin crust and is a little burnt around the edges..... OLD SCHOOL! The pizza sauce and the fresh topping make this pizza yummylishious! I liked that it was thin crust, not full of grease and wasn't your normal pepperoni or olive pizza! Fresh basil leaves, round fresh sausages..... just FRESH! Everyone who worked there was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu. The menu isn't huge, but they have a variety of pizza, salad and appetizers to choose from. They are also pretty quick with getting the pizzas out, so once you have waited for your table, there is not too bad of a wait to get your drinks and food.

I would recommend this place for more adults on a date night then families. It is family oriented, but it's so small having larger groups is harder for them to accommodate. If you don't want to wait very long I would say try visiting this place on a week night, before the dinner rush. I enjoyed Bianco's and will definitely drive the 40 minutes again to have dinner here!",4,2,3

The secret to Bianco is really quite simple:  Have kickass friends.  

What I mean is, have friends who will call you mid-evening, and bless you with the great news that they have enrolled in Bianco prison, and would you kindly meet them for dinner in a few hours after the NCAA basketball games have finished and maybe after a little self-primping in front of the bedroom mirror?

Why, yes!

So, addressing the exhaustively discussed subject of wait time, having done both the hard-time and the soft-wait outside of Bianco, I have to say, ""just get over it"".  Is anything worth waiting two, three, four hours for?  Yes.

UT national championship football tickets.
A reunion Smiths show at the Hammersmith Apollo. 
A plane ride to Seattle.

And Bianco Pizza.

What I'm trying to illustrate is, you are there for the experience.  The wait, the wine, the conversation, rinse, repeat.

Eventually, you will get into the gorgeous early-century brick general-store-esque building and feel like you've accomplished something.  Don't be a bitch about it.  This is the highest quality slice you will likely ever have, and though some will argue the necessity for the buildup, you will never have the same dining experience anywhere else.  Moreover, any place equally hyped and ballyhoo'd, will leave your wallet hundreds of dollars lighter.  Bianco does not.

So, when the waiter came, and my gf and I finished off our delightful $9 Sangiovese (from Arizona, nonetheless -- hint: this is a RAAAAARE varietal for our state), we observed that they had Oak Creek Nut Brown Ale (from Sedona).  An absolutely PERFECT brown ale, far FAR better than Newcastle or anything Four Peaks could brew up (the secret is in the superior Sedona water).  My gf got that one, and of course out-selected me.  Instead, I had the Mirror Pond Ale from Bend, Oregon .. a superior brew that represents the promised land of micro-brew very appropriately.  Both were highly complimentary beers for our impending pizza dinner.

For our pizza selection, we chose the Rosa (the must-try for Bianco n00bs) and the margherita with prosciutto added on top.  The Rosa, as usual was outstanding, but the margherita\/prosciutto was absolutely fucking phenomenal.  I couldn't get over how delicious this creation was and as a self-aggrandizing foodie, it was truly the best pizza I've ever had the pleasure of knowing.  Please do yourself a favor, loyal reader, and give consideration to this option upon next visit.

Overall, I could not dream of giving Bianco anything less than a solid 5 star rating.  Look, I gag and eye-roll about overhyped goods like any other would.  A band?  If they've been out longer than 5 minutes, released anything longer than an EP, or have had a showcase at SXSW, hell, they're way to overexposed for my taste.  A football team?  I hate USC for no reason.  And so on.

Bianco doesn't deserve similar criticism.  Go for the oddity and hype, but stay because you have the sense to appreciate a remarkable overall experience.",6,3,5

For quite a long time I've avoided Pizzeria Bianco. I didn't want to be disappointed by all the hype. I'm a New Yorker. Pizza is like family. Don't f-with family. 

So why did I finally break down and go to Pizzeria Bianco? I had to see for myself. I had to know. I had to understand why this place is rumored to be the best pizza in Arizona--and quite possibly, the best pizza in 'Merica. We were going to a Suns game that night and thought...why not? 

And is it the best you ask? Does it live up to the hype? Is it worth the long waits? 

Definitely. Most definitely. Absolutely. Unequivocally. Undeniably. Yes. I have had MANY a slice of pizza in my 4 decades of life and the pizza at Pizzeria Bianco is unmatched in Arizona. 

Despite the rumors of long waits, our party of 4 was able to slide right in at 5:30PM on a Wednesday night with no wait at all. Valet parking at Heritage Square made it nice. The restaurant was busy and before we left, that's when the wait was just beginning. We were greeted promptly and received drinks right away. We settled in and enjoyed this smaller size brick building and checked out the crowd. It was a little drafty on the cooler December evening but the number of people in the restaurant made it comfortable.  Within 15 minutes, we had two fresh, hot, straight from the brick oven pizzas on our table. We enjoyed the Bianco Verde pizza and the WiseGuy which is a sausage and caramelized onion pizza. Big deal--sausage pizza. No..seriously. This is sausage from Shriners sausage factory here in PHX. Like the best sausages in town. And they didn't disappoint. Both pizzas were incredible tasting though my meat lovers both said that they thought the BiancoVerde was superb. 

It must have been the Gods smiling down on us that we were able to just get right in with no wait and I'm not sure when I will tempt fate again, but seriously...this is the best pizza I've had in Arizona. Hands down. No joke. Believe the hype.",3,2,2

Once again, the food was a solid good food so there is no issue there.  My only issue is the claim that it is the ""best"" - that I don't get. OK OK if I have to be super picky, I can also add that the cheese was on the stingy side = large patches of exposed tomato sauce were evident throughout the pie.

So I can't comment on the huge insane waits The restaurant is pretty cool and industrial with not very much seating.  I can see how it gets packed at some points.  They only have bottled Soda so no refills for which is kind of odd and a bit expensive. I guess they want to move people out.  The pizza's are a pretty good size for one hungry person or to share if you have two not so hungry people.  I got the pistachio pizza and it was pretty good.  I had never heard of one before, but I had to try it.  It wasn't anything mind blowing.  I think maybe I had built up the experience too much before I went and thought it was going to be mind blowing.  It sadly was not.  I think it's a fine pizza place which I wouldn't wait hours for.

For anyone reading this, allow me to say that no matter what anyone else says, I promise that you can trust me when *I* say that if you have not eaten here, you must, and you will want to come back. This is the premier eatery in Phoenix. It is the best pizza in the country. A writer for the New York Times once wrote that in his column and nearly lost his life for doing so. The only way to make better pizza is to do what the owner, Chris Bianco, does: make each individual pizza every single night with your own two hands, grow your own basil and fresh tomatoes, and import the finest ingredients from as far away as Italy. No one does that. No one is crazy and OCD enough to consistently do it for over ten years. 

Chris is. 

If you can sense the passion I feel for this place, good. There's a reason for the defensiveness. People who come here and don't like it (a) weren't educated on what to expect regarding wait times, or (b) are simply in stubborn denial and can never be saved. That's just the way it is. Some people still insist the earth is flat.

So what's the deal with wait times? It's really not that complicated and if you know what to expect, your experience will be perfect. (Yes, perfect). They don't take phone reservations. If you show up with a small party (let's say 4 people) at 6 pm, a two hour wait time is typical. What do you do during those two or more hours? Plenty of things! Pizzeria Bianco is right next to Bar Bianco, which is a charming restored historical house with great service, nice appetizers and a lovely drink menu of unique brews and wines. The bar alone is the kind of place you would go to chill out with friends, so killing your wait time there is not exactly a chore. Alternatively, you can wander out of the Heritage Park area where the restaurant is and have a drink elsewhere downtown, say the Roosevelt or Majerles. 

The key to all this is as follows: Their ETA's are on-the-spot accurate, and you'd better be back within 30 mins of that in case they are early. If you lose your spot in line, you're screwed. On a busy night you will probably not get seated again. The one reviewer who missed his spot and was seated one hour later was incredibly lucky. 

Almost everything I've tried on the menu has been delicious. I like several of their appetizers. The tomato\/mozarella is comprised of hand-picked tomatoes and mozarella that Chris (again) makes himself every day. The ""Spiedini"" consists of a mouth-watering melted cheese wrapped in Italian prosciutto. Mmm. There is a small set of choices (5 or 6) of their custom made pizzas. My personal favorite is the Wiseguy. You can also hand-pick your own toppings. Be aware that the pizza is thin-crust, and a few of their selections are sans tomato sauce. The ratio I've found that works best is approximately 3 pizzas for 4 people. One per person usually leads to taking some of the left-overs home, and since I live downtown this in turn typically involves my handing the take-out box to an extremely lucky and usually very happy homeless dude (downtown has no shortage of those if you walk around, alas). 

You cannot know or understand Phoenix (or claim to be a true Phoenician if you live here), if you haven't eaten at Bianco. Go forth and enjoy. You can thank me later.",22,8,16

Wine: Primitivo, Antico Sigillo '10 Salento, Italy (red)
I'm starting out with the usual wait (45 minutes this time) at the bar next door*. I was impressed that the hostess will come over to let you know when your table is ready. The interior of the bar is warm, intimate, and very cute. I usually take my reds from California, Spain, Australia, and Argentina...this Italian is very impressive. Full-bodied, fruity (blueberry notes), very mellow tannins, consistent from the front to the back end. Thanks to the knowledgable bartender, I have a new favorite.

*The wait was more like 15 minutes. It pays to dine solo.

Pizza: Rosa, with extra fennel sausage - excellent, but not for red sauce lovers
When the waiter set my pizza on the counter, my eyes got very big. It arrived piping hot and smelling delicious. It's as delicious as it smells and looks, too. The pistachios, cheese, and red onions are all melted into the wonderful crispy-tender bread. I'll ask for some olive oil...my promise to lose five pounds before New Year's Eve is now destroyed. The olive oil made a great thing even better...great for dipping the extra crust into.

Make an evening of the Bianco's experience.  Here's how:

When you arrive, walk inside and put your name on the wait list.  They will tell you an astonishing number like, ""Your table will be ready in three hours.""  Don't worry, waiting is just as fun as eating there.

Proceed next door to the wine bar.  Order an appetizer and a bottle of wine.  Enjoy the company of your friends.  Slow yourself down, relaaaaax.

Order another bottle of wine.  At some point midway through this bottle your table will be ready, if you do it right.  I have never waited the actual time quoted by the hostess (or it didn't seem like it because I was having fun).

After a few glasses of wine, and the fun but hefty wait, your food will taste better than if you had gotten it instantly--  I promise.

After getting your table, continue to relax and enjoy yourself.  You waited for this table, and it is yours.  I recommend that you order at least one more pizza than you think you want, because you will want it, if not right then, at least later.  Have another bottle of wine with your food.

Here is what to order:

MARGHERITA - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil 

ROSA - Red Onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, AZ Pistachios 

BIANCOVERDE - Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula 
+++ ADD Crimini Mushrooms


Again, if you try it, and you don't like it, that says more about you than the place.  It is okay though!  Bianco's is not for everyone.  Walmart is for everyone, and look what that place is like!

This was by far one of the worst places I have ever eaten pizza in my entire life.  21.00 for a pizza that the crust was so paper thin and burnt.  

This place is by no means kid friendly.  No butter for their bread and no pepperoni.  Who the hell ever heard of that?  No pepperoni?  I speculate since the crust was so thin, the grease from the pepperoni would destroy the paper thin crust.  Just with the salami, stingy amount of cheese and the wood fired mushroom, they all fell off the pizza.  seriously, you would need a spoon to eat it if it was a real pizza with real amount of toppings.  And it was so thin you just may have needed a spoon to eat it an.

I was just telling my spouse how this was the most unfriendly kid place when in walked a husband and wife with 4 kids.  Wouldn't you know 2 of them were so excited about having pepperoni pizza.  

Had it not been for the fact we had them put garlic on the pizza it would have no flavoring.  I did mention it before but let me tell you again, they were very stingy with the cheese.  For a place who boasts about making their own mozzarella you would think they would but a sufficient amount of cheese on their pizza.  It is alot cheaper to make fresh mozzarella so there is no reason for not putting enough on their pizza except for the fact their crust could not hold it.  This is by far one of the worst pizzas I have had in a very long time.

The reason for my -4 is due to the service. My party of 3 walk in and see if something is available well we are subject to a wait which is normal I'm not worried. But what irritates me is that we sit down they bring us water which is great. I could use some water but that is all they give us we were not asked if we wanted something else just assumed water. So then they ask if what we wanted so we placed an order and there was no further offer of something to drink. We wanted to try a few beers and a bottles coke. 

After we are done eating and just sitting down we notice other people were given bread and a new party just sat down and were asked. ""Can I get you something to drink?."" Are you kidding me.  If I decide to come back it will be for the food not the service.",2,1,0

I got there 40 minutes before they opened and still missed the first seating and then ended up waiting over 90 minutes after they opened which by what some people have written was a short wait. I'll agree that it's in a cool old building and the little house where the bar is next door is cute too but I can't justify the wait to the quality of the pizza being served. If there wasn't such a long wait I would have given them the 4th star but with that wait, I can't be a fan. There's not much of a selection in there pizzas but they do have a short list of other toppings you can get. I had a margherita and had them throw on some Sicilian Anchovies and sliced tomatoes. The anchovies were great but the tomatoes were sliced way too thick and they skimped on the Basil. I have a bit of experience working in a pizzeria and I know that you sometimes have to pop the bubbles, I guess they don't believe in popping the bubbles on their pizza because I had a big one and with a super hot oven it just burned an looked nasty. No, I won't go back but I don't live in Phoenix but I travel here often. Next time I will try a different pizza place where I don't blow an entire evening waiting.",2,0,2

If you do go, I suggest going a Tuesday or Wednesday and getting there at 4 or sending someone there at 4 to hold your place.  They open at 5, but the line is snaking already by 4:45.  Luckily, there are two bars nearby to while away your wait time.  I prefer the Rose and Crown, but you can also do their wine bar and get your tab transferred over.

Everybody should come here and try it out for themselves.  It is definitely a unique Phoenix experience.  That being said, I would rather go to Cibo and wait 0 to 20 minutes for equally delicious pizza.",5,2,2

Fast forward to last week.... my son and I were visiting the Arizona Science Center that morning and we were hungry.  Friends had been telling me for years that I was cRAzY for not loving Pizzaria Bianco so I thought, what the hell.  They're open for lunch now, it's just a 5 min wait, so lets give it a whirl.  My son was demanding pepperoni pizza (which I already knew they didn't have) so I ordered the Sonny Boy with sopressata, figuring he wouldn't know the difference.  I also had a glass of wine, and I was a little disappointed at the limited selection of wines by the glass, considering they had a wine bar next door.

The pizza, thankfully, was much better this time.  It still had the charring around the edges, which I understand is their thing, but it wasn't burned.  In fact, I think the bottom could have been cooked a little more.  The middle of the pizza was quite droopy, and not stiff enough to hold up the toppings that kept sliding off.  The sopressata was a fantastic salty treat and the olives were very flavorful.  My son loved it, too and we polished off the whole pizza in record time.

With the much improved pie, the food portion of our visit deserved 4 stars, but what brought my rating down was our server.  I'm not even totally sure she was our server to be honest.  She took our drink order, brought one of our drinks, and asked us if we needed anything else toward the end of our meal - but that was it.  Someone else took our pie order, refilled water, brought my wine, dropped off our lunch, and brought the bill.  Our server was MIA for 90% of the meal and I don't think she ever smiled once.  I'm cool with people who are all business - in the business world!  But if I'm at your restaurant, you should make some attempt to be welcoming and helpful.

If I were downtown, I would certainly lunch at Pizzeria Bianco again, but I wouldn't drive out from the East Valley just for this.  I know of several other places with great pizza that are closer to me, and who seem to care a little more about their customers' happiness.",7,4,5

Well, for us the answer is a complete yes to around 40 minutes in June on random weekday but to hear people say they have waited four or five hours for a table is a concept I do not think I could understand under any circumstance.

The menu is simple and outside of some small before choices do not expect anything other than pizza. The pizza, however, is indeed what the place is all about and for me I had to try the Wiseguy - Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage for my first visit and I think it would be hard to imagine going for anything else.

Before the pizza the Handmade Mozzarella, Local Tomato and Basil with Extra Virgin Olive Oil was simply stunning and if the food alone was not good enough the service is a definite match to the gastronomic sensation. In particular the person (manager?) that hovered around both here and next door at the bar making sure everything was moving smoothly was amazing.

We heard from the locals about the long line and decided to set aside time to just experience it. An experience it is. We arrived about an hour before it opened, just to get on the waiting list. Our wait was 2 1\/2 hours of which we spent sitting outside having a couple drinks and appetizers from the bar. Everyone else waiting seemed to be in good spirits and made for good company. No one seemed upset at the wait as all of us were there for the same thing. A taste of what ever was creating the wonderful smell drifting from the pizzeria. Periodically a greater would come by just to verify that those on the waiting list were still waiting. 

Once inside the incredibly quaint pizzeria, we were greeted by friendly staff and waiter. We never felt rushed and simply enjoyed some of the best pizza we ever had. The atmosphere is enjoyable and relaxing. We spent around $100 because we wanted to, not because we had to. The pizza is around $11-15 each which is very reasonable. 

Should you decide to visit, be prepared to spend time waiting. Be prepared to enjoy yourself and relax. Be prepared to have a conversation with other people around you. Most of all, be prepared to have to endure smelling the incredible pizza for 2 hours before you can eat any. This restaurant is about the experience, and it is an enjoyable one.

Service was fast and good. We both had the margherita pizza. It is very delicious. It's not the best pizza I've ever had, but it's pretty close. Very fresh, simple ingredients. It was about $50, including tip, for two pizzas and two Mexican cokes. I wouldn't spend that much on pizza very often, but it's fun for a treat every now and then. I also don't think I would wait hours for this pizza, but if you come at the right time, no need to wait. It's all about planning if you want a good experience here. Does it live up to the hype? Can any place live up to this much hype? I doubt it. Just come for an exceptional pizza sometime when you feel like splurging.

Pizzeria Bianco has been raved about for many years now, with good reason! Chris Bianco has built his establishment into a Phoenix staple. Every visit I'd say well over half of his clientele is brand new, no small feat since he's spent 14 years in the same location. To say the least, Pizzeria Bianco is a well-reviewed, well-loved and die-hard restaurant.

Put this into perspective: I've patronized Pizzeria Bianco roughly 40-50 times (many of those times have been in post-100 degree heat, non-coincidentally the Bar Bianco next-door opens an hour earlier than the Pizzeria so grab a beer) and each time I've waited 1-2 hours for the privilege. Are there many places in the whole world where you'd do that? Once you taste the sensation within, you'll understand.

The pizzas are wood-fired in a brick oven and until recently, they'd all been fired and created by one man, Chris Bianco, whom forcefully had to take a leave of absence from his dedication to his craft. Why? All the wood smoke and flour dust has taken a toll on him over the years and irritated his asthma to a point where his doctor insisted that he stay out of the kitchen if he wanted to live into his 50s. It may seem silly to an outsider but to see Chris's passion for what he does, you'd instantly empathize.

The creations that come from the oven are simple, yet complex in flavor and texture. They're thin-crust Italian style pizzas that are true to the heart of Tuscany and Roma. In true Italian spirit, less is more on the pizza with only a few ingredients playing on the stage. My favorite at Bianco is to order a Margarita pizza and add mushrooms and perhaps some garlic. What returns is amazing. You wouldn't think that dough, tomato sauce, mozzarella, basil, Criminis and garlic could formulate something so flavorful and distinct but there it is.

A favorite before the pizza is unquestionably an Antipasto plate! Familiar ingredients grace the plate almost every time (mushrooms, sopressata, olives and parmesan) with one or two guest players (eggplant parm or roasted red pepper). Given a health dose of olive oil and graced in the oven, the plate comes to you a variety of textures and tastes.

There are a few salads offered as well. The pizza, antipasto and salads comprise the entire menu. It's simple but elegant in a setting at Heritage Square that makes it a true, one-of-a-kind experience and completely unique to Phoenix. Yes, you need some time to kill (I recommend getting there at least an hour before opening) and the ability to tolerate weather and a few line cutters, but you will be rewared with what has been called and I whole-heartedly agree is the ""best pizza in America"".",1,0,1

Third place was Mozza in Los Angeles, Second was Di Fara's and the best in the country was Pizzeria Bianco. Coming from a renowned source making a ""best in the country"" statement is pretty bold. Why Lombardi's in NY or Frank Pepe's in New Haven didn't finish top 3, I'll never know...

So I had a floating holiday that I took and decided to take the family to Phoenix, AZ. The main reason? To call out Bon Appetit on their bluff. Read up from many sources, like Yelp and Chowhound, and was told to get in line at least 1.5 hours before they open @ 5pm. You can read from the other reviews that they spent 3-4 hours waiting to get in. Plan ahead and you'll avoid their fates...

Got there @ 3:15pm on a Friday with mags and a cold drink. Within 15 mins, two cars pulled into the parking lot and within 30 minutes, twenty people lined up behind me. Thank God I did not take the warning lightly and so we waited...

Finally opened @ 5pm and not a second earlier. Got seated and we ordered the homemade mozzarella, tomatoes and basil appetizer. The real deal definitely tastes different than the factory produced ones: it had texture and character, but could use a splash of balsamic vinegar. Highly recommended. We then ordered the Margherita (ask for extra basil) and the Wiseguy. The Wiseguy was thick wood roasted onions, house smoked mozzarella and fennel sausage. While other tables took their leftovers home, we demolished dem two pizzas. The verdict: while it was the best pizza I had on the west coast, I must say it was not the best in the country, although it came very close. I am thankful that they are only 6 hours away from So Cal, so a weekend trip can be had at any time.

Housekeeping notes: Make sure to start a wait list. There are going to be snakes that try to jump the line. Pizzeria Bianco doesn't start their list until 5pm, so that only applies to the second seating. Bring reading materials and cold drinks (as it was 100 outside).

Ever since I moved to the Valley of the Sun five years ago, I've watched peoples' eyes glaze over as they ramble on and on about how amazing the food is there; many argue that it serves up the best pizza in Phoenix (if not the country).  Why it took me so long to get there is a mystery but after going today, I can unequivocally say that the rumors are all true - it is fabulous!

LOGISTICS: Nestled in the Southeast corner of Heritage Square near the Arizona Science Center, Pizzeria Bianco sits in a rather small brick building with an outdoor patio and charming little bar.  While the space restriction makes for a more intimate dining experience, I could easily see this place becoming swarmed with diners during peak hours; so perhaps coming before or after the main lunch\/dinner rush would be a good idea for those who are patience-challenged or in a time crunch.  Park in the structure off of 5th and Monroe - the restaurant validates your ticket (I ended up paying $0 instead of the usual $12).  

FOOD: Wow!  Just wow!  I ordered the Market Salad, which consisted of fresh local cantaloupe and honeydew melon, cucumbers, mint, red onions, and peppers served in a yogurt dressing; it was hands-down one of the most creative and refreshing salads I've ever had!  They serve their sodas in old fashioned glass bottles and bring freshly-baked bread with olive oil to your table - haven't had olive oil that good in ages!  If you can't decide on one pizza combo, they're great about doing halfsies.  I ordered a half Margherita, half Rosa (red onion, parmigiano reggiano, rosemary, and Arizona pistachios) pizza - both were sheer perfection!  Crust is heavenly, ingredients are beyond fresh, innovative toppings - who'dve thunk pistachios would taste so good on a pizza?!      

SERVICE: Pizzeria Bianco runs like a well-oiled machine.  The service staff is amazing - both friendly and fast.  They greet every single guest who comes and goes - pretty impressive! 

I don't really think you can go wrong here.  I came in skeptical but left a believer; somehow they worked their magic over on me - another happy Pizzeria Bianco customer.  A thousand flies can't be wrong!  ;)",123,94,120

Living in the SF Bay Area we recently drove to Phoenix to visit family. We could stay only several days. Having heard and read about the marvelous pizza served at Pizzeria Bianco, we naturally decided to pay a visit. We called several days in advance for reservation for our party of eight (the eatery accepts reservations for six or over). We were told no reservations were available and that we were welcome to come and stay in line; a wait of several hours. Our party consists of two octogenarians, two individuals disabled by diabetes and two young children. Under the circumstances we requested an accommodation. This was refused by Carey (sp?), who went on to say that under no circumstances does Pizzeria Bianco make exceptions, never have and never will (even the French Laundry in Yountville is not that rigid). She absolutely refused to let me speak to her manager.  Carrey went on to say she frankly didn't care about any of the circumstances and that her establishment was above any criticism at Yelp or Zagat. Well, maybe so, but I am not so sure that our elderly and disabled colleagues will agree. What say you? Let's educate these folks about the price of arrogance. Chris are you listening?

For those thinking now that I must be a raving lunatic there were some underlining reasons. I suffer from a debilitating disease and decided to take my children on a cross country adventure while I still can. Also them experiencing first hand a individual who is passionate about his work can only be a inspiring and positive thing in their young years. Or at least I hope so.

I guess I could go on and state how unique and great the pizza was. Or how the salads were made with the best ingredients available.
Or how even the potato salad in the antipasto may be the best darn potato salad I ever tasted. I pretty much tried everything on the menu except one salad and found everything outstanding.

But I would prefer to address those who find it absurd to wait so long for pizza. I understand the puzzlement yet I believe they may tend to generalize it as just pizza. Which is not the case.
Where in this country can you find people waiting outside for two hours in the blazing heat seem so happy? Strangers laughing and talking with each other, telling stories of past meals at Biancos to first timers. The joyous atmosphere was one of the first things I noticed and it was contagious. Once in the dining room nothing changed, people taking a step back, slowing down and enjoying great food and company. That in my view is what great food is all about.

Producing this type of magical atmosphere in a restaurant is extremely rare and can't be a easy task. But somehow Chris Bianco has and this may be the very reason why people are willing to wait. The truth is. It's more then just pizza.

Edited to add. Those who claim it is just pizza. As a chef I can tell you the test of true talent comes from taking a minimal amount of ingredients and making them shine.And without pristine ingredients it is nearly impossible to make something great if one is taking the minimalist approach. Chris Bianco's pizza's are every bit as good as Thomas Keller's Oysters and Pearls. And are harder to produce.",12,1,12

There really is a lot of HYPE about Pizzeria Bianco that I don't really understand now that I've eaten here. 

Came here on a friday night and put our names down. We were told it would be about 1 hour to 1:45 minute wait. It really is a tiny place, that fits only about 30 people maximum. So we walked over to Bar Biano next door.

Once we finally got seated after waiting about 1:30 minutes, we ordered fairly quickly since we were famished. 

I ordered the biancoverde pizza & added red sauce. My italian friend said you can't have a pizza without red\/tomato sauce. It also came with ricotta, mozzarella cheese topped with argula. My friend ordered the Margarita pizza (mozzarella & basil). 

The food took another 20-25 minutes. We thought bread was complimentary but apparently you have to order it. 

No matter how great the food is, a 2-hour wait to me is just ridiculous. I was forewarned but I didn't free like this was a one-of-a-kind pizza place. Don't get me wrong I LOVE wood-fired pizza but it's just too long of a wait.  

My Italian friend said the pizza crust was good, but he had an issue with the cheese saying it wasn't ''authentic''. My guess is many places in the Valley won't truly have ''authentic'' Italian cheeses.

The pizza was definitely delicious.. my crust was slightly burned but I ate the whole pie by myself!

It's really not too bad a wait if you have bevvies, a cheese plate, and good convo.  Plus, the hostess comes from Bianco comes over to the bar to let you know your table is ready - a big plus. 

We had the Sonny Boy and the plain cheese (I forget the name), as well as the ""house"" salad (also forget the name, but it was the basic one).  Everything people have said is true - the ingredients are sooooo fresh and the flavors melt together extremely well.  Plus, being Italian and from the east coast, I am a huge fan of thin-crust pizza - I haaaate thick, soggy, greased-up pizza.  Bianco makes his pizza crust paper-thin so that you can actually enjoy the flavors of the toppings and cheese rather than be chewing on a french baguette.

My reward was a platter of the brightest green and tastiest olives I've ever eaten, a salad fit for royalty, and a pizza so indescribably delicious, I simply can't find words.

My old college friend and I arrived at 6:15 on a Tuesday evening and were told that we would have an hour wait (even though the restaurant looked half empty) and were told that we could go next door.  It's almost too convenient that they own that bar.  Again, nice atmosphere at the bar, it feels like you are in someone's house.  And I liked that they were able to tell us there that our table was ready and that we could bring our drinks over to the restaurant.

We were seated within exactly an hour.  We ordered the Rosa and a Magherita with garlic.  Very good but not life changing.  Our waiter seemed to think that his job was finished once he brought the pizza.  Had to ask a few times for water, the water was never refilled and in fact my glass was taken away without asking me if I needed anything.

Fortunately, we decided to go there during an off hour, around 3:30 pm on a Saturday. The wait we were told was still an hour. We killed time next door at Bar Bianco but then I wondered why wouldn't they use this space to serve more patrons? Anyways, the wait ended up to be a quick 30 minutes. 

The Wiseguy was what was recommended so I had that (fennel sausage, mozzarella, and onions) and added mushrooms to it. We also ordered the Margherita for the table. Overall, the menu is pretty short and simple. Pizzas came out pretty quickly. The combination of flavors on the Wiseguy was good, but it seemed a bit too oily. The Margherita was a bit more traditional and was good. 

Staff was friendly and the ambiance was nice. I liked the waiting area Bar Bianco next door. It was like you were sitting in someone's home. The restaurant itself is small. If you have a large group, good luck.

I'd moved out of Phoenix in 2001 and had never gotten to try this pizza.  And if a Chicagoan was willing to go out on a limb and say the best pizza was not in Chicago (heresy to some), then I needed to try this pizza.

The first time I tried Bianco's not yet infamous pizza, I was visiting friends in town.  I waited an hour and a half to try the pizza, spending most of the wait time at Bar Bianco next door.  We made friendly chat with the bartender, who left quite a good impression on us.  We also enjoyed the goat cheese crostini appetizer and split a great bottle of red.

That first time, I was actually scalded by too hot water in the women's restroom.  Some kind of problem with the system shot out near boiling water when the dishwasher went on in the kitchen.  When I went back to my table, I asked for ice for my hand.  Chris Bianco was still making all the pizzas then, but he overheard what happened and comped my pizza before it was even out of the oven.  

The first pizzas we tried were the Biancoverde and the Rosa.  Oh, the crust!  The cheese!  The fresh ingredients!  Yes, I was in love.

The next year, I waited THREE hours to have this pizza.  No, I am not crazy.  The pizza is THAT good and I was only in town for two days.  I'd been dreaming of this pizza for an entire year.

Thank GOODNESS Bianco is now open for lunch.  The wait times are not nearly as long.  In fact, this brings me to my most current visit.

On Friday a friend and I went to Bianco at 4:45 p.m.  I walked into the door to inquire about the wait.  I was told to... wait for it... pick out a table!  No wait?  At Bianco?  The Gods were shining on us.

I have been to Bianco many times since moving back to Phoenix two years ago.  The food is, as always, excellent, even though Bianco's right hand man is more likely to be making the pizzas these days.  I highly recommend the pizza, natch.  But I also recommend the Mozzarella and Tomato salad, which is made with freshly made cheese (AMAZING) and freshly picked tomatoes.  And, of course, you should not skip the bread.",6,2,4

Last night (Friday), my friend (a former Phx resident) was back in town for a quick visit and wanted for us to finally try out Pizzeria Bianco. We put our name down around 8:30pm and were surprised to hear the wait was only about 1hr 15mins -1hr 30. We went next door to the bar (which was super cute, btw!) and chatted over a bottle of wine. Right when we started to get really hungry, we were notified that our table was ready. Yay.. time to find out what all the hype is about! 

Since there were 6 of us, we decided we'd order 1 of each pizza so we could try it all. However, once the waiter came to take our orders, we all changed up our orders. After about 10-15mins or so, out came our pizzas. Well, 5ish of the 6. I say, ""5ish,"" because the 6th one was really really burnt (whereas ours were just ""really burnt"") and the waiter said another one would be made and ready in 2 mins. 

We all hungrily waited for the last pizza to come out and when it finally did, we dug in. I dont know if it's bc we waited a few mins or what, but all of our pizzas were soggy. That combined w\/ the burntness made for a very bleh pizza. While it wasn't horrible, I dont see how it could get all the hype and 5 stars that it does.

And no offense to the Italian population of Phoenix but this blows my mind more than how Luis Gonzalez's piss-ass bloop hit won the 2001 Diamondbacks-Yankees World Series.

They offer 6 different pizzas on the menu - three of which don't have any tomato sauce.  I ordered the Margherita (tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, basil).  Here's the verdict...

Cheese - The fresh mozzarella was FANTASTIC.  Sharpest mozzarella I've ever had on a pizza.  I'm assuming it's bufala (buffalo) mozzarella but can't say for sure.  You get one blob of cheese per slice and, while I would've gladly taken more, this was best for the overall balance of the slice.

Crust - Fantastic as well.  It hit all three C's - crispy, chewy, and charry (made up word but should be self-explanatory).  I'd have sworn it came from a coal oven (consdiered the best b\/c it gets super hot - in NY, they aren't legal but there's a grandfather clause for some of the older places).

Sauce - Good but clearly plays a backseat to the cheese and crust.  Kinda like Spinderella to Salt & Pepa or talent to Hall & Oates.

I also tried one of my friends' Wiseguy (House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage, Wood Roasted Onion).  I didn't like it as much - missed having tomato sauce - but liked the smoky mozzarella and really liked the sausage.

The restaurant is clean, quaint, and pleasant.  Despite it taking 3 hours (!) to get a table, it really wasn't much of an ordeal as there were places nearby to get drinks and the hostess was very helpful (e.g., providing an estimate time when we'd sit, telling us when to check back in).  And sometimes you can't rush it when someone's putting that much TLC into their pizza....

Pizza is good...top 5 of my pizza places...actually I cannot name more than 4 places that I LOVED for pizza, but this is not good enough to commit to my top 3. My standards are not too high, as you can read from my other reviews. 

Ok...so this area is pretty nice...I happen to be there during August when the temperatures are 100+ and there are no people walking around. I think not many people do walk around. We get there, and place our name and wait the 4.5 hours...we end up going shopping, looking around stores, the area, and staying at the pub next door to play pool, but still...we were waiting 4.5 hours. It was HOT waiting. 

We finally got to our table and looked over the very simple menu. There were around 6 pizza choices, two antipasto dishes, few salads, and that as pretty much it. There were 6 of us, but we ordered 4 pizzas which happened to have 6 slices each, so we got that and were ok with the portions that we ate. We asked about ordering stuff to go because my friends wanted to share this ""highly rated"" pizza with their families in Glendale, but the waiter said that we were only allowed to place in 1 order. This is kind of sucky because if you were to order something and decided later that you wanted more food, they probably would say that you cant...so that knocks off a few points on my ""should i go back meter"" 

The pizzas were good. wood fired stuff, thin crust, good cheese, good sauce, salty sausage, decent prosciutto. Not worth the wait. at all. I mean...yeah it's good, but not too good...but it's good.

I ordered the Margarita; I wanted to leave the more exotic toppings for the next time (if there is ever going to be one!). To be honest, the pizza was pretty good, but definitely nowhere near the best I have ever had. It reminded me of the pizzas I had in Italy, so you could say that it is very authentic. To me, the cost (for the size of the pizza) and the hype doesn't justify what is served. I probably would not go back, unless someone was treating me. I have heard many say that Grimaldi's is actually better than Bianco, so it's onto try that next. If that too doesn't work out, I would rather make homemade pizzas myself. :)",0,0,0

In their own words: ""Cozy, brick-walled restaurant serving wood-fired Neapolitan pizzas & Italian small plates""
Yeah the pizza is superb...and you wouldn't think of it especially in Phoenix. But it's awesome. Their bread which you can dip in oil was even better. No lie again.  
But is the #1 in the US. In my opinion, no. It's definitely top 5 but NJ\/NY\/CT have the best pizza anywhere. 
It's a small place that also has outside seating and it's waitress service. No slices here and their toppings vary from proscuitto to mushrooms. 
Their pizza was near melt in your mouth. Heaven I tell you and it makes you remember how pizza should be. 
We had: 
*The bread which they bring out. I am still dreaming about it. Could be the best we had in ages. 
*Local Organic Greens with Red Wine Vinaigrette - pass on it. It was just greens...and the same one. 
*Green Olives - they come with the bread as well...tasty. 
*Margherita - We added olives and Wood Roasted Mushrooms. So fing good! A small pie is enough to feed 2. 
*Local beer on tap (they had just 1) and it tasted like bud...so not a good choice. 
Otherwise this place is worth a stop for the tourist feeling.

We stepped in for lunch and the setting was incredible. This little place was all my wife could talk about for the last 10 years. Living on the east coast for years you could imagine her excitement when we finally made it Phoenix to try this quaint little pizza shop in heritage square. 

Upon arrival after the lunch rush, they greeted us warmly and seated us straight away. Once seated the waiting game began. With only a third of the restaurant and the outdoor seating area full we waited almost 15 minutes to be greeted by our server. No welcome, no hello, not even a have you dined with us before? 

I never having been there before started asking basic simple questions about the menu and any information I wanted was available to me as long as I asked the correct questions. No explanation nor tour of the menu options were ever provided nor were we told about items that were available that are not on the menu! 

The order was taken and that was the last time our server checked on us for the entire meal. Our server kept walking by to see to her other tables not once coming over to see if we enjoyed our food or beers. The beers went dry about half way through the meal and the water ran out shortly afterwards. My wife was embarrassed for all the people she raved to about this establishment. She touted it to be the ""best"" in the country and what we were left with was an absolute fail!

The pizza is interesting with high quality ingredients and delicate subtle flavors. However, it is not the best in the country and know where near the most exotic or exciting flavors that they should be boasting to make this place amazing.

It's great that one pizza comes without cheese, but when we asked if they had other veggies for toppings, we were offered mushrooms and anchovies. Yes, she said anchovies were vegetables. We thought we'd see if we could get sliced tomatoes on our pizzas, but the waitress discouraged it because it'd be really soggy. Um, what? Way to sell your pizza. Turns out it's really soggy anyway.

I have been reading for years that is was rated best pizza in Phoenix so I talked my BF to try the place.  My BF is from Michigan and he has lived here for 6 years and says he is disappointed in the pizza in Phoenix. We went on a Tuesday night and I was not aware that people wait hours to eat here since it is such a small place.  We did not have to wait and ordered the Sonny Boy...sorry but it was ok first of all it was small, very little toppings, and talk about thin crust it was like a tortilla and not a lot of flavor.  Its was good but what I cannot understand is the price $18.00 are you kidding me, that is overpriced.  We are talking about downtown Phoenix, not Chicago or LA or NY what are they thinking.  My BF was not happy he said it was definitely over rated.    

What would have made it really bad is if we would have had to wait hours for ok pizza.  Grimaldi's has oven fired cooked crust and even though it is a chain I think it is better tasting and less expensive.         

I traveled to Italy and they keep saying the pizza is very much like the pizza in Italy, I can't comment on that because we ate seafood, pasta, mozzarella and other great food never order pizza. But if we had I can assure you they would never charge $18.00 for this pizza.

The Pizza is fabulous (although not the best I've ever had).  The service is beyond impeccable and the entire atmosphere is befitting its exclusivity. And the price, while not cheap, is pretty reasonable for such an intimate setting with an experience that people obviously crave.

As you'd guess, we waited an hour in line just to put our name in, and then two hours after that to get a table (in fairness, we had a party of 8, so that probably contributed to a bit of the wait).  To me, it wasn't quite worth all of the fuss. I'm sure they'd argue that they don't expand for quality control reasons and to keep the experience what it is, but to me it just means I have to wait for something where the ends don't quite justify the means.

Its worth noting that there is the possibility of a wait. Me and my wife got there at 6pm and we could get seated without any trouble but by the time we left an hour later, tables were all taken and people were forming a queue. That said, its well worth it, and while you wait, there is a bar next door that seems cheerful enough.

In terms of what to order, I would recommend the Rosa, which is a red onion, parmigiano reggiano and rosemary topped pizza finished off with almonds. The addition of DEEZ NUTZ might seem something you put on random food when you're high but is infact an amazing idea that made for a first rate meal. 

Basically the pizza followed by the chocolate cake is a treat that shouldn't be enjoyed on a weekly or even monthly basis but when you need a meal to remember, go for this combination every time.

The wait was long, but I think that made the experience all that much better. We ordered four of the six pizzas on their menu:

MARGHERITA (Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil): Amazing. The freshness of the tomato sauce was out of this world as well as the succulent olive oil in each bite.

WISEGUY (Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage): The homemade sausage was brilliant. Also, the onions were caramelized to perfection.

BIANCOVERDE (Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula): One of the more unique pizzas that I've had as it is topped with fresh arugula after it comes out of the oven. Although it was very good, this was my least favorite out of the four pizzas we ordered (this was my friends favorite though).

MARINARA (Tomato Sauce, Oregano, Garlic [No Cheese]): Again, the tomato sauce at this place is so delicate. Words cannot describe how good it is. Also, the fresh oregano in every bite was terrific.

On top of the great food, it was really cool to watch Chris Bianco (the chef) cooking as the kitchen is on the floor. The service and the decor of the restaurant was very good too.

I plan on making a road trip to Phoenix again for some of this great pizza.",1,1,3

It  really depends upon when you get there.  If you don't like waiting, then don't go, save some room for us foodies, those locals and us travelers that appreciate the art of food! 

If Gayle (Oprah's friend), Martha Stewart like the pizza, then what more can you ask to know about PB.  PB is also highly recommended by Wine Spectator (June 08), Vogue and The New York Times.  PB truly lived up to all the hype an exceeded my taste buds!  However those who know me, know that I love food and I will travel for the experience.  PB is now on my top 5 restaurants!

You can enjoy the wait and relax by drinking a glass of wine from the bar (they own next door).  You can drink outside in front, or on the park benches, tables and seating next door on the patio.  Relax, enjoy life and  take in all of the scenery including the local garden.  However, make sure you leave someone in line at all times to save your spot and perhaps rotate.  My wife and I enjoyed a glass of Aardvark Pinot Noir which was fantastico!  The appetizers looked terrific, but I wanted to save room for pizza.  We migrated over to the long table outside Pizzeria Bianco and the staff is so organized, that they write down your location while you wait so they know where to find you (this happens once they are open and your name is on a LIST).  

If you have ever had pizza in Rome, Italy, then this is next best place to visit!  It rivals a place that was highly recommended by Rick Steve's (travel guru), somewhere near the Pantheon. 

My Favs:
BIANCOVERDE - Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula
WISEGUY - Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage.  The fennel sausage is awesome!  We did not order enough of this pizza!  

We also had the MARGHERITA - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil, but it was not one of our favorites.  A great sauce though!  Perhaps we should have added a topping!

We ordered some appetizers all of which were good.  The ""Handmade Mozzarella, Local Tomato and Basil with Extra Virgin Olive Oil"" appetizer was fantastic.  The best mozzarella I have had since Cortona, Italy.   Not sure how they got such ripe tomatoes for this time of year.  Perhaps they have great suppliers and they get to hand pick every tomato. 

Our service was fantastic, from the bar tender next door (great wine and beer recommendation), to the waiter (cheerful, high energy).  We  enjoyed listened to all of the recommendations and watching the Chris Bianco chef\/owner in action!  

Tips: 
If you get there early, there is free parking.  If you get there late, you can park in public parking and they will validate your ticket (discounted rate).

I wasn't expecting much, so I was pleased when the pizza turned out to be pretty good. The crust was nice and bubbled with lots of little black bits around the edges. Good crunch on the rim and a good chew going towards center (that's what she said!). But the highlight for me was their red sauce; not too sweet, just a bit of tang, a little spice, and very well rounded. It really made the pizza for me. Their other ""sauces"" or lack thereof, left a bit to be desired when alternating bites between pies:

On to toppings, quite a bit of onions, a drive by of cheese, basically another spray paint of cheese, and a few pieces of sausage.  Wow so under performing!  I paid for bread at $18.50 this is an $8-10 pizza anywhere, the amount of toppings on this, pizza this is a $6 pie.  I don't understand the pricing here, I paid for crust!

On a TUESDAY night without any other major downtown events going on.  We said no to the appetizers and only later realized that the bread plates (1\/4 baguette sliced) did NOT come with the meal and had to be ordered separately (for at least $5).  

THE REWARD:
It was heavenly pizza, but maybe only because I was so starving that I was about to kill someone!  I lived in Italy for nearly two years and have never had pizza even close to this authentic in the US.   I ordered the arugula\/goat cheese pizza (""somethingbianco"").  

Food is the top.
The wait is almost unendurable.
The service is suboptimal.

They use olive oil instead of a balsamic reduction, so it is different.  I thought the crust could have used some flavor so I really didn't eat it (too burnt anyway), but I really like how they blended the cheeses, meats and vegetables for the toppings.  We had a party of 10, so I was able to try a slice from three pies, but I can't pick a best because they are all so very unique.

If you can believe it the best part of the experience was waiting in line and hanging out in the front...but then again I was with my girlfriends and we were pretty positive about the wait...we also met some really cool people local and visitors.

At the table the menu is pretty simple.  First we shared the mozzerella, tomato and basil salad and the Spiedini and for pizzas we ordered the Rosa, Sonny Boy and the Margherita.  All were good but - I've had better.  Maybe it's just me but the crust was ok (not perfectly chewy more on the crispy side) and burnt.  Maybe it's the best Phoenix has to offer?

I've been coming to Phoenix for four years on a regular a basis for business and only now was a I able to get in.  My many previous attempts ended in failure either because a) I was here on Monday when PB is closed or b) I wasn't willing to wait the usual 2.5 hours.  Even at 9:30pm on a sweltering Tuesday night, the wait was still 45 minutes.  So we went next door to Bar Bianco, had a couple glasses of wine, some excellent olives and a fontina and flatbread app that was a nice surprise accompanied with some sweet pickle slices.  

Almost exactly 45 minutes later (excellent estimating on their part) we were summoned over for the Main Event.  I ordered the spiedini starter - essentially a slug of fontina wrapped in prosciutto and grilled on a skewer - it was incredible.  My dining companion and I went on divergent pizza paths: he ordered the wiseguy - nominally a white pizza with perfectly caramelized onions, mozarella and fennel sausage.  I went with a classic margherita pizza, but added fennel sausage.  Mine was quite good, with a very thin crust, good tomato sauce and just enough mozzarella and plenty of sausage.  A little more basil would've been good and the crust was a little thinner than I would've preferred around the edges - usually my biggest complaint with neopolitan style pizzas.  My dining companion (a crusty, New York Puerto Rican) and I traded slices and ended up liking each other's better.  His wiseguy pizza was excellent - with a slightly thicker crust around the edge was was both crisp and soft with a very slightly sweet taste, which could've been a residual from the amazing sweet onions which topped to pizza.  Even my crusty companion grudgingly admitted that Bianco's pizza was excellent - though he reserved first place on his list for Grimaldi's in Brooklyn.

The space is both charming and comfortably contemporary, the service is exceptionally efficient and helpful, and the pizza is pretty much perfect. 

This was my second visit to Bianco, so I've tried a few pies. I like the brief but thoughtful list of choices, which features both red sauce pizza and a few with no sauce at all. I liked all that I tried. The Rosa is their signature pie, and I found it both unusual and delicious, with its red onion, parmesan, rosemary and pistachio combination creating just the right amount of savory flavor and texture to keep me interested throughout. The fennel sausage on the Wise Guy is spicy enough to make me sit up and take notice, and I adore the caramelized onion and smoky cheese. And the Margherita was everything I expect from that classic amalgamation...a simple tomato base with mozzarella sans peer and the freshest basil, picked just outside the door. 

I had the featured green salad on both visits, and appreciated the simplicity and freshness of ingredients. The bread and olive oil they bring out with the salads is probably unnecessary, but deeply valued; I could make a meal of both these things at any other restaurant and be completely happy, given the quality of the offerings. Still hungry? Desserts are not precisely made in house, as they're made off premise, but by the same folks who made the pizza, just at another location. And delicious, by the way.

We arrived at 5:45 p.m. on a blistering 113 degree Saturday night and were told we would be seated in 2-3 hours. Ok. Not great, but ok. The scam is that you have to wait at their bar next door or be forced to check in every hour. By their time calculations we should have been seated around 8:15 p.m. Guess when we sat down to dinner, folks? 9:30 p.m. We spent that time spending $$ in their not-so-well-cooled bar with not very many seats. Nice way to get 2 tabs out of one evening, restaurant owners! Once we were seated in the actual restaurant, we also sat at a bar. We love bar seating--however, this bar has one side with leg room, the other side has no leg room. Our awesome luck continuing, I was wearing a skirt, and guess which side we were seated at? It was not a good arrangement. Their waiters didn't feel like waiters, more like expediters working the floor. After suffering through the indignity of an outrageously long wait, one of these expediters didn't approach us for another 10 minutes. Now it's 9:40-ish. Finally we get service, which was on the gruff side. I still can't sit at the bar quite right, so when a couple leaves the other side of the bar (the side that has leg room), I approach the manger to see if we can move. Perhaps a tiny victory, but a victory nonetheless. We spend the next 20 minutes talking about the very good pizza in an set up that hucks the bucks from those who wait...and everyone does. Even though we enjoyed the pizza, we won't be going back. Tip: the bald bartender said their slowest season\/slowest nights were May-September, Wednesdays and Thursdays.

If you're gonna show up at Pizzeria Bianco and wait for hours upon hours anyway...might as well make a nice day out of it. Bring the following things:

-Reusable cloth grocery bag
-Large blanket\/beach towels
-Playing cards and\/or board games
-Disposable ice chest (if you don't want to buy beer\/beverages from Bar Bianco)
-Sunscreen
-Frisbee (optional)

There are ample patches and hills of nice soft green grass in and around heritage square...absolutely perfect spots for a makeshift picnic. Pack everything in the cloth bag and show up to PB around 4:30 or so. You'll have to stand in line for a few minutes to put your name in...but once you do...it's Picnic time! 

Find a nice shaded grassy hill...there's a quite ideal one over towards the Science Center. Lay out your towels and make a fun evening of it. You can relax with some beverages while playing cards with your significant other and as a nice side effect the people watching can be pretty great while you do so. By doing this, you're really killing two birds with one stone...you're getting to have a nice picnic...and as a side effect...you're negating the whole negative aspect of going to Pizzeria Bianco...the wait. Once your name gets called you simply toss everything back in the bag, throw the disposable cooler out...and voila...you're ready to have some great pizza in a cozy rustic pizza joint after your picnic. 

I really don't see why you'd want to do anything else...it's making the best of a less than ideal situation. Each time I go there I see people lethargically pacing around with a beer, bored out of their gourd...I just don't get it...might as well try and have some fun. 

Now on to Pizzeria Bianco itself...I didn't feel the need to really add too much content about the place itself, because what's already been said by the 300+ reviews is more than sufficient. I will say this...the pizza is great, but it's not all that different than pizza you can get at Cibo for example, where the wait is almost non-existent.

The ingredients were so fresh!  The waiters were super nice and the food came out pretty fast!
I will DEFINITELY hit up this restaurant the next time I am in Phoenix!",3,0,2

Made it a point to make it this time and see what all of the fuss was about. Long story short, don't compare it to anything else. It is a great pizza with an awesome crust and fresh, delicious toppings. Higher end than your standard NY pizza, but won't say its better or worse than any other style. All in all, a great pizza...but I had immediate seating. May have felt differently if I had waited 1hr.  :)",0,0,0

First things first, the owner. Chris Bianco is a great man with excellent taste. Second, the restaurant. Small, intimate, cozy, & damn it if you don't feel special just eating there in the dim lighting of a warm fire. Third, the food. The simplicity of the menu allows us to center in on the food & not be drowned under 5 pages of fluff like other ""restaurants"". The focus on only a few items that are made to enjoy & not just fill you up is how things should be done. Why have 100 choices if they all fall under the radar. Mae West said, ""Between two evils, I generally like to pick the one I never tried before."" When your done having to choose between several food ""evils"" at other places, come down to Pizzeria Bianco and try a slice of heaven. The pizza is great, I'm not going to paint you a Monet like description. Come down, buy a pie, find out for yourself. Read a review, then try the food & make up your own mind.",1,0,1

In fact, I've been now 3 times before writing this review as I wanted to make sure my 'best pizza' claim was true.  Each time I've had a different pizza and each time I've walked away wanting more.  The crust is amazing and it is cool to watch them make the pizzas.  Best time to go is for lunch...but get there early as it fills up quick.  The restaurant is small and cozy...with a cool bar next door if you are caught with long wait.  

It isn't often that places live up to the hype...but Pizzeria Bianco exceeds it!",1,0,1

It was one of the worse restaurant experiences I have ever had, and I never ate the food. The snarky hostess is most unwelcoming. She informs us it will be a 3 hour wait and that I must call every hour to check in, or she will take my name off the list. As a guest, I was treated like they were doing me a favor. This chick must be bangin' somebody to keep the hostess job. When we spoke with Chris, he shrugged his shoulders, like ....""I know I've heard it before.""  There was more back and forth nonsense that I will spare you from reading.  We went to the bar next door and had some wine and talked to folks. The bartender had the audacity to tell me they don't need to be nice, look how busy they are?I Um, are you in a service business or what? Does ""hospitality industry"" mean anything to you?!  I'll take Nancy Silverton's Pizzeria Mozza in L.A. any day; where the menu is varied, the food exceptional, and you are welcomed and treated like a guest. Even if there is a wait, it's never a ridiculous 3 hours. It's only Phoenix for Pete's sake. Spare the attitude.",4,3,3

The thin crust was delicious. The toppings excellent.

I love the super thin crust, the flavor of the tomato sauce, and the generous toppings and fresh ingredients. I ordered two different pizzas during my two visits here. The wiseguy (+ mushrooms) was super tasty! The margarita (+ sausage) was also tvery good. My tummy was very pleased with this place!

Service was so-so, the guy was nice but kept talking to his team when I was trying to order. 

Good beer selection, no happy hour specials that I saw. Got a half and half pizza; the margherita was good but was not in the traditional margherita style, it was basically a cheese pizza with basil on it. Boyfriend got a white pizza with sausage that he enjoyed. House salad was great, came with lots of fresh baked bread and the best green olives I've ever had! So fresh and delicate, exactly how an olive should taste. (I should have asked where they came from, they were that good!) 

Small dining room and bar setup, fire oven right next to the bar so you can see the pizzas baking. Really cute outdoor area with an herb garden, lime trees, tomato plants, etc., which I'm hoping they use for their recipes!  Overall, good experience, would return.",0,0,1

Since we live in Peoria, a trip downtown for lunch is just not feasible.  So, we decided to attempt lunch at Pizzeria Bianco.  I consider myself a bit of a foodie and have heard that this place has the some of the best gourmet pizza in the country.  I've heard the stories of lines for hours, just to get a chance to taste these creations.  With that much hype, I was expecting to be disappointed.

I WAS NOT!

My wife and I shared their fresh mozzarella, tomato and basil salad.  I've been eating fresh, homemade mozzarella for years and have found that I like mine with a bit of a salty bite.  Theirs is very creamy in texture, with good flavor, but not enough salt for me.  As I reached for the salt shaker, I found that in the shaker was not your plain old iodized salt but sea salt!  Color me impressed.  The salad was as fresh as could be and we both enjoyed it.

For our pizza, we chose the Biancoverde pizza, a white pizza with mozzarella, ricotta and arugula.  Despite having a classic, peppery bite when eaten alone, the arugula added a different texture and a bit of sweetness to the pizza.  The combination of cheeses was perfect.  With a bit of homemade bread to start, the salad and pizza, we left very content.

I can honestly say that Pizzeria Bianco lived up to the hype.  When I'm downtown, this will be my first choice for lunch.",2,0,0
