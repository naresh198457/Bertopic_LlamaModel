Arrival and check in were relatively easy. The taxi\/Uber drop off point is fairly close to check-in. That is not always the case in Las Vegas so it is a nice plus. The line at check-in moved fairly well and the process moved at a decent pace too.

There are plenty of elevators which helps. The appearance once you are off the elevator is lacking though. It feels like you are in a parking garage. The hallway leading to our room were in ok shape, but there was some miscellaneous garbage like a beer can scattered about. Not a crazy amount, but enough to notice. Especially since the beer can was still there the next time we went to our room.

The sleeping area of the room looks ok in passing. The decor has been updated in the last few years I would assume. I do appreciate there is no carpet, as the general lack of cleanliness in other areas would lead me to believe carpet would have been filthy. There is a good amount of space and a lot of windows. We had a decent view of the High Roller. One of the lamps was not working and the outlets were not conveniently located.

The bathroom was a different story. It looks as though it has not been updated since the casino was built. On top of that it looked and felt a little dirty. Everything was in working order at least.

We did not eat at any of the restaurants, so I cannot speak to them. That being said, none of them sounded like anything we wanted to try either. The casino area is ok. There are plenty of tables, including plenty of low minimum tables.

This casino is in a good location on the strip. It is near the center so you can access most of the other casinos fairly easily. It tends to have a decent price so that can be tempting. If budget is your concern I would look elsewhere.",14,6,6

Pros:
- Location is great. You can walk to a bunch of other casinos, clubs, shopping, etc. Caesar's and The Forum Shops are just across the street.
- The pool party is a lot of fun! It's the 21+ pool, good music, lots of people, drinks, etc. Lots of people in their 20's and early 30's.
- Carlos 'n' Charlie's and Margaritaville are inside, and they're both good places to eat and drink. Carlos 'n' Charlie's was a lot of fun.
- Free parking for guests.
- Relatively inexpensive rooms.
- Real flamingos are outside!

Cons:
- Parking is HORRIBLE. It took us about 40 minutes to find a space in the garage.
- The walls are paper thin. I swear, the people in the room next to us never left their room and were always talking loudly. We could hear them anytime we stopped in our room, when we went to bed, and were woken up early by them.
- The rooms are just okay - definitely felt a little dingy\/dirty. The carpets in the halls definitely need a major cleaning or just replaced all together.
- We booked a room with 2 queen beds, and somehow we ended up with a room with 1 king bed. They said they did not have any with 2 beds available at all. That was weird. We didn't mind sharing the bed, but what if we had come with 4 people supposed to share 2 beds? It was Fourth of July weekend, so I guess I understand. But I don't know. It was just annoying.",1,0,0

Hilton bought it quite a while ago to add it to their huge flagship Hilton on the north end of the strip near the convention center (well at the time it was huge, now it is being dwarfed by new projects). 

It has been remodeled and spruced up by Hilton, and now it really serves as a mid-level Casino\/Hotel offering for Hilton in Vegas. Hilton has several large Condo\/Timeshare properties now for non-casino vacationers, and the Hilton still serves as the flagship. But, a few years ago, Hilton sold this property to Harrah's Group. 

As such, the hotel is nothing special for Vegas goers, and in this town where the hottest thing is whatever is the latest and largest, the Flamingo dwarfs in comparison. 

Perhaps the best part of the hotel is the large tropical courtyard with its lush greenery. They do offer a lot of cheap room specials, so it isn't a bad choice for value travelers who still want some Vegas luxury, and don't want the riff raff in the next room that comes at the Circus Circus, Hooters, Stratosphere or Excalibur.",11,8,10

The casino itself is definitely nothing special. They were doing some serious remodeling of the high limit gaming area, so there was some construction going on, and one of the bathrooms was down because of it. That was somewhat annoying.

If I was reviewing the casino as a whole, I'd probably go with only two stars. However, the poker room made it enjoyable for me. Sure, aesthetically it is not a great poker room. There are only a couple crappy TV's, the chairs are just mediocre, and sometimes there aren't too many games going. However, the frequency of drink service to the poker room is excellent. Also, the dealers are very friendly and I didn't witness a single dealer error during numerous sessions. This is also one of the few places around that offers a $2-$4 limit hold'em game regularly, so if you are trying to play some very low stakes on the strip, this is your place. Just don't expect to beat the rake, and expect there to be 4-8 players calling each flop. You've been warned..... Also, they have good bonuses between 4am and 4pm, the best of which is $100 for getting aces cracked. If you're in the $2-$4 game your aces are going to get cracked anyway, so you might as well get 100 bucks out of it.

All in all, I kept going back to the poker room because I knew there would be plenty of free drinks, the dealers would be good, and the bonus options were among the best in the area.",0,0,1

Even since I have been back, I still call the Flamingo home, even when I stay elsewhere. It's homey, kitschy charm with its high-class feel is always great.

The casino is one of my favorites as it is large, yet still small enough to manage, unlike some of the larger neighboring casinos. Plus, I've found it to be one of the best about comping drinks while you are playing.

As far as the hotel goes, it is pretty standard to most Vegas rooms: long twisting hallways that seem to never end, and few elevators. The attention from the staff made the stay even better though. We had an issue with the room the first night, and after calling the front desk, it was resolved immediately, making our stay a lot more care-free.

The location and price are what sets this location apart more so for me. You have all of the major casinos within a couple block walk, no need to take the tram or taxis. 

Combined with celebrating my 21st birthday, some friends got married the same weekend and that was equally as lovely. The wedding chapel on the grounds was quaint, full of lush tropical plants, and of course the fun animals all around.

I definitely recommend The Flamingo!",0,1,0

Did not stay here but came here for my very first comedy show and they happen to be free tickets* (I'll explain later) we received for attending one of those timeshare hard sell things. Vinnie put on a good show if you like lots of swearing and picks on every nationality, preference, category there is. There is participation from the audience. In our show he picked on the Blacks, Whites, Mexicans, Asians, Jews, Europeans, American Indians... the President, military, service workers - firefighters, cops... students, men, women, old, young... pretty much everyone. He's got a good memory and will pick you out from the audience especially if you're in the front section. 

* The tickets were given to us free but you have to pay for two drinks.. So a small bottle of water and a glass of soda (Sprite) came out to $31. That was the sucky part :(

However, I did consult these Yelp reviews before booking the Flamingo and because of that I booked the GO Room. I wanted to check out old Vegas and thought ""How bad can it be?""

Indeed. I have no idea what these reviewers are talking about with the rooms being dirty. Maybe the Flamingo has made some changes, but the room we had was seriously nothing short of amazing. It's probably the nicest room I have ever stayed in. Really. 

It could just be the proletariat in me, though.

You can't compare the Flamingo to Aria or Cosmo because you can't get a room for that price in those places. You can't say you don't like a movie theatre, so you're going to the OPERA next time because one of those things is not the same price as the other. I know it is difficult for rich people to understand that things cost different amounts... but if you can afford a suite in the Cosmopolitan then don't cheap out and stay at the Flamingo and then become all enraged when there is no water for your pomeranian in the room. If you want a fancy hotel, go pay a fancy fee.

You get what you pay for and unlike some other casinos I have stayed in, the Flamingo was worth every cent. Then again, I'm not all rich and fancy. And I don't have a fancy pomeranian. It's because I'm poor and I don't know how to live my life. And I have a dog allergy. I'll never be able to afford a suite at the Cosmo, though, so for me the Flamingo is as good as it gets. WOW I DON'T EVEN FEEL DEPRIVED AT ALL!

There was a long line to check in and out. There was also a comparable line checking into the Paris. I'm not saying lines are cool, just that if you can't afford some kind of presidential VIP welcoming party I don't think you can do much about the whole ""waiting in line"" thing that happens in life and stuff. Luckily, when we got to the front of the line the guy at the counter was totally excellent and upgraded us to a suite even though he could tell we weren't all upper class by our flip flops and non-designer sunglasses. His awesomeness more than made up for that line that makes you ponder your lot in life as a non-celebrity.

You can't expect fancy parking at an old Vegas hotel, they did things different when this place was built... which is basically what I think makes the Flamingo rock my face off. I would rather have a fancy place for me to stay than my car, but I am used to parking my car in shady places since I'm so low class and all. Naturally, fancy people will be absolutely infuriated by the fact that the red carpet doesn't reach into the parking lot of inconvenience. If you have given your rich-person driver the day off and the limo is in the shop you can always use the valet, although I know it is hard to surrender your Astin Martin to one of the great unwashed service industry people.

We thought that the walls were thin when we woke up the morning after and heard a ton of music, but it was from the pool. The pool that makes staying at the Flamingo completely worth it! The birds, the greenery, everything was so cool! Even if the hotel was just average, it would still be worth staying here just for the pool. Of course, if you sleep wearing a blindfold on a pillow made of satin I can see how this would be totally bothersome. And I know flamingos aren't that impressive to see when you eat one for dinner every Saturday with a side of caviar or something. But normal people think it's pretty cool.

Overall, I think the Flamingo is worth the risk. I don't think you can go wrong with the GO room from what I saw, and with that level of coolness I don't see how much lower than average the other rooms can possibly be. Worst case scenario the room is a little dirty and you spend your whole stay in the pool anyway. Watch out, poor people pee in it!",15,23,12

The room is large but the furniture and bathroom are old. Rust, mold, pilling off paint, etc. (Refer to the attached pic) If I pay for what I get, then I am OK. But this cost, service and quality are worst than motel 6 in Las Vegas. The cost of motel 6 without promotion is around $45.00.
One more incident that make me very upset. This only happen in Flamingo casino. While I was changing the slot machine (my reward card already inserted into the slot machine, and in the middle of inserting the voucher), a bartender passed by and I asked for a drink.

This hotel is OLD, DIRTY, and POOR!! I booked a room through hotels.com and thought I got a really good deal for a hotel literally in the CENTER of the strip. I was a tad hesitant when I got the room because so many people had mix reviews... LET ME CLEAR IT UP JUST STAY AWAY!!!!!

When I arrived check in was quick and they let me check in 3 hours early and I was happy. I asked the lady for a remodeled room, but she said those would be an extra $30a night to upgrade, so I asked how are the standard DELUXE rooms she said they were nice, just like the pics on the internet, if so then i should be fine without the upgrade.......

I get to my room and was horrifield, it was SMELL; DIRTY, DARK AND UNINVITING!!!!!!! My 5 year old daughter said NO she did not want to stay here because she noticed dirty ashes from cigarettes still on the table. The room was worst than a motel. I'm talking the dirtyiest motel you can find! Imagine a room you see in those horror films in the middle of no where!

So I went back down and told them that they need to give me another room, now all of a sudden to upgrade to the infamous GO ROOM is $40, so I was like whatever this is false advertisemnt on the net, but give me the upgrade.

We get to the new room open the door and was like better, but STILL NOTCLEAN. THe beds were dirty and the carpet were gross there were sunflower seeds on the floor!. THe little lamps were literally hanging off the walls. At this point I was so tired and pissed that I was just like whatever... at least its better than the first room. THen I sat down to observe and the room started to look like a place where people come for ""cheap thrills"" the vinyl head boards and mirror thing on the ceiling and sillouette doors.

DONT LET THE PRETTY PICTURES FOOL YOU!! The hotel is not clean to the naked eye. Not even the upgraded GO rooms. Its still dirty. I would never stay here again, let alone come close to the place thenext time I am in Vegas. The staff was rude, especially front desK and housekeeping.

Did a fairly good job with the new rooms but lipstick on a pig. Bathrooms still suck. My room simply could not get cool. 

I had to get new room keys on 4 occasions because mine stopped working. The cell phone and magnetic money clip excuse works once, but when I'm keeping it in my back pocket and it continues to happen?  I spoke with scores of other people with similar issues. 

Food:  in room dining is an hour plus wait every time you call. 

Dining options?  How about margaritaville and Carlos n Charlie's?  Wait, are we in Mexico?  These places are cliche and I impressive. 

Carlos and Charlie's.  Their famous Queso. You know what it is?  Freaking nacho cheese sauce out of a can. Same you'll get on your ballpark nachos. Queso my ass. 

There is a nice steak house called Center Cut. It doesn't seem to fit with the white trash tourist model they've gone with. 

Given the other eateries here, I skipped it for another nearby steakhouse (Ruth's Chris) with a known reputation and actually lower prices. 

We stayed here because it's a Total Rewards property and I pressure my friend into it for that reason and used the fabulous pool as justification. The pool was nice, especially if you love to people watch. Douchebags galore, but a good time nonetheless. 

My last night here, tonight, is the first of four where my floor didn't absolutely wreak of marijuana. 

Service was sub par throughout the venu. 

If you book, except a solid 20 minute minimum wait to check in. 

If you need new keys, there's a separate line for that, thank goodness, however the first three times in that line it was 20 minutes just for new keys. The last time there was no wait at all. 

Resort fees. I don't mind paying them, but the hypocrisy of running nearly 4 year promo campaign denouncing them, only to reverse said policy, is irritating at best. 

The pimping out of Carlos n Charlie's as a night club, by seedy type characters feels like they've brought the street promoters inside the property and lowers the atmosphere to the same level as the strip club promoters on the streets. 

Dining options were by far the most disappointing. 

I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 because it is what it is and I knew that coming in, but it failed to meet my even tempered expectations. 

If you're the type of person who thinks red lobster is a high class seafood restaurant, and eats at places like Carlos n Charlie's, señor frogs, or hard rock, when on vacation you'll enjoy this place. 

If you're looking for a nice hotel with any semblance of class and comfort, look elsewhere. 

Also, they will require a 200 dollar deposit upon check in to cover any room charges. I gave them cash because if you use a credit card you won't see it back for 8 to 10 days after checkout. 

This is a pain in the ass because the line to check out tomorrow will be a solid 30 minutes and I'm dreading that. 

This did give me 65 dollars in free play, but I had to go from total rewards to the cashier and back. Then was given an 800 number. 20 minutes in I got cut off with non call back. The next call got the job done, however then there was a problem getting it at the total rewards counter. The young lady there was great, and manually wrote one out for me. Shouldn't be that difficult, but I did appreciate that they got it sorted. 

Also, my toilet is jacked. Sometimes won't stop running. I took the lid off to fix and it sprayed water all in my face and made a huge mess. I got video of fixing it the next time, face out of the way of course. 

I will always recommend staying at a Total Rewards property. But I won't stay at the flamingo again unless they make some pretty massive changes. 

I also forgot to state that they tried charging me 35 dollars for early check in even though there were no rooms available and there would not be until at least noon (3 hours later). They said I could pre check in, and then come back for keys later at no cost. I asked how that's different than the 35 dollar early check in when no rooms are available. The desk clerk said there was really no difference. They just have to offer and try and push it. Soooo, we try and get 35 more dollars out of you for nothing. How shady and unethical is that!",2,1,0

The high roller Ferris wheel is located at the back of this area.

Well, this guy is now in the business of saying ""no"" to all Harrah's offers. Free is good, but comfort and time are more important. Harrah's properties steal both. My first complaint with Flamingo is it is tragically dated. Like, it's sad. We recently did a week-long stay where we split it between Flamingo and Paris. My first words once we got to our room in Paris were, ""We're never staying at Flamingo again.""

Everything about the place is ancient, with no hope in sight. The rooms are comical. Almost as bad as Bally's. So, you would think well at least you could get a room with a view, right? Well, no matter how many hundreds of dollars we (and by ""we"" I mean my wife) donated to the casino floor, we still were never afforded a strip-front room. And that's crap, because I know it's an option. 

Two stars because I've always found the staff to be very friendly and the buffet is a good option on an off-night with a coupon.",3,0,0

We took a chance on The Flamingo last year because there weren't a ton of options within our budget for the 4th of July weekend.  I'd read the reviews so had a pretty good idea of what to expect.  My reasoning was that we wouldn't be spending a lot of time in the hotel room anyway, and for the price, the center-strip location would be hard to beat.

I should preface this by explaining I am not a prissy kind of girl, nor am I a germaphobe.  We've stayed in some pretty seedy hotels before...and survived to tell about it.  That being said, this was one of our more cringe-inducing experiences.  

Before going up to our room (which was one of the standard, outdated ones...not a modernized Go room, or whatever they're called), we asked whether we had any upgrade options, but were told that because of the holiday weekend, everything was booked.  We had very low expectations so made our way up to the room with hopeful optimism.  What greeted us in the hallway right outside our door was a pile of garbage and used tampons.  Yes, tampons.  Used.  But I reasoned that maybe housekeeping had had an unfortunate trash bin overflow or something.  Who knows.  Anyway.  Then we went into our room and found it to be just sort of smelly and gross.  My husband pointed out the mystery stains all over the carpet, but that really didn't faze me.  What did turn my stomach was what looked to be (excuse me while I gag...) poop smears above the headboard and on the ceiling above the bed.  Alright, so admittedly we didn't conduct a smell test or whip out our chemical analysis kit and therefore can't say with a hundred percent certainty that it was, in fact, poop.  But it was suspiciously disgusting.  After being told there weren't any other available rooms, we had little choice but to tough it out and just keep from touching...well, anything.  Our plan was to dump our stuff and just get the heck out of there.  As I freshened up in the bathroom, my gaze cautiously made its way up to the ceiling overhead, but by that point I wasn't all that surprised to see it was covered (covered!) with what looked like pubic hairs.  Ewwwww.  Again, I can't say for sure that my untrained eye would be able to discern the difference between leg hair, armpit hair, chest hair, or whatever...but you get the idea.  It was grotesque.  Not to mention puzzling. 

Our stay wasn't all bad.  My husband took it upon himself to talk to management and ended up getting us moved to a mini-suite, which was far from luxurious but a definite step up.  Clean, at least.  And spacious.  (Interesting that they were able to find a room when they had been ""completely booked"" earlier...but I digress.)  In both rooms, you could hear the music from the pool really loudly.  I'd suggest earplugs if you plan to sleep in past 9 or 10am.  The 21-and-over pool was awesome, we spent a lot of hours there.  We don't gamble so I can't say whether the casino was good or bad.  There weren't a ton of restaurant options within the hotel, so for meals and clubs, we ventured elsewhere.  As I recall, there wasn't a resort fee like at other hotels on the strip.  And parking was free.  Wi-fi was like $14 a day.

Would I stay here again?  Hmmmm.  The location really was convenient.  And the pool was almost good enough to persuade me, despite all the other negatives.  I don't know, maybe, we'll see.  I can't say I'd recommend this hotel, but if you do decide to stay here, it's probably worth the added expense to upgrade to a Go room.  Good luck...you may need it!",4,1,1

To start Check-in was over an hour due to not enough staff. It is not fair to assume what she was doing but it drove me crazy to see the supervisor behind on a computer oblivious to the line and acting like she was doing something important. 

Entered the room and it reeked of marijuana. Called front desk and they were going to send someone but no response. Finally got used to it since the entire floor had the same stench.  Our toilet ran continuously. After use we would have to open the tank to fix it. 

Worse part of hotel is the elevators. On main floor you wait, and wait with a crowd and when one arrives it is mob mentality to fight for it. Riding them was an adventure. One stopped on every floor with no button pushed. Another the door opened at odd times!  

Casino-  not expecting much but several of the dealers out right rude. One even had the nerve of telling me with how I placed my bet it looked like a tip and she ""knew I wouldn't do that...""

DO NOT stay at the Flamingo! It was the worst experience I had with a hotel. 

Casino: WAY too smokey. There was barley and ventilation so I was constantly coughing because of the smoke. 

Flamingo Baggage Check Employee: Extremely rude and pushy. They were basically begging for a tip from me and my boyfriend, even though he did nothing and smacked our luggage against the walls as he dragged it. And then he had the nerve to say to us ""was the service that bad"" and stormed off. I don't appreciate people begging me for a tip, when in reality I would only give a dollar, but i didn't think he deserved one and don't appreciate the pushiness.

Hotel Room: Horrible! Sink was clogged, sink leaked everyday all over the counter, didn't get running water some nights instead i got a sucking noise out of the sink and bathtub, bathtub knob didn't shut off so water leaked, bathtub was rusted on the faucet and kinda dirty, hairdryer was rusted, stains on the floor, pillows were HORRIBLE quality, problems with the safe (had to call a repair guy to fix it), no fan for the bathroom so it got very foggy and didn't suck up air after someone went to the bathroom, and the cups that were there to drink from were dirty.

Pool: Its nice but can get VERY crowded easily which makes it difficult to find a seat. Water was EXTREMELY cold in the pool which ruined the pool experience. It was freezing!

STAY away from the Flamingo. Such a horrible experience. I took pictures and videos of all the issues and sending it to the Flamingo this week. Just horrible!

Okay Let's Break it Down with the Pros first:

Pros: 
-SO CHEAP. I paid $80 for two nights and three days
-small but it's a fun casino...won $240 whoo!
-new CRAPS machine just put in 3 days ago (there's not much pressure here where people dont stare at you and hoping you dont roll a 7...plus i always get scared of throwing the dice across the table and ending up hitting someone in the face..)
-the garden right outside the entrance to the hotel rooms....is BEAUTIFUL. there's a huge koi pond and the koi fish is HUGE. and of course there's flamingos!!


Cons:
-ghetto ass elevator (in the parking garage)..smells like pee
-elevator inside the hotel is okayyyy....not really a con. made me sick though
-blanket is not thick enough. looks like a regular sheet but a little thicker. and theres this other blanket that is made of fur and colored pink. kinda gross looking. reminds me of a dead flamingo on the bed or something

Also when I booked my room, I called the Flamingo to get all the details because I've never stayed there before. Nobody told me there is a seperate $11 fee on Saturdays for the pool, after already paying the $30 resort fee.

I asked if I could change my reservations to Ceasars but they said no, and dont worry theres no fee on Sunday at the pool. So i thanked the guy at the desk for his kindness and told him the other guy was rude, he said ""who was that? Ben? Hes known for being like that?"" I said yes Ben, hes a jerk. The guy at the desk just laughed. 
So Sunday,  there was no fee at the pool but there was still a long line its 21 and over and a college party once again, my wife was furious.

The website said it was ""opening in March."" So we called ahead to make sure that the pool would be open. This was only a partial truth. A lie by omission. There was only one pool open...a tiny little pool that usually serves as the 18+ pool. People were bitching and moaning about coming to vegas for a tan, only to be squeezed in like a sardine around this tiny pool. You were lucky to get a sun chair. Also, you canNOT take food or drinks into the pool area. The security people are kind of hard asses about it. 

That said, I'll make a few comments about the hotel. It is right on the strip and is a good value for the price. The room was newly renovated and was cozy, cute and comfortable. 

The service was not great. I was hard-pressed to find an employee with a smile on his or her face. The hotel itself is pretty janky. It is Vegas, so expect to pay close to 4 dollars for a bottle of water. And you can't get a snack for less than 10 dollars. 2 bloody mary's poolside will run you close to 30 dollars. You can get a bucket of cheap beer for 20 bucks. Internet is 14 dollars for 24 hours. 

Next time we'll definitely pay more to stay at a nicer hotel, but it was satisfactory for the purposes the purposes of this trip.",0,0,0

We had to park in the far end parking lot which is about a 1\/4 mile from the hotel lobby. Second, they put us in the wrong room, so we complained and they reluctantly switched us to a non-smoking room. They acted like they were doing us a favor for the switch. Third, we were woken up twice in the morning, once at 8:00AM and again at 10:50AM by guests who were incorrectly  booked in our room!! Fourth, upon leaving the elevators were not working - we had to haul our luggage down 22 flights of stairs to finally exit onto the 1st floor roof only to be greeted by an unfriendly security guard that told us we needed to have more patience with the elevators. After dealing with the rude employee we preceded  to exit the first floor roof down a flight of stairs. Keep in mind, we had no idea where we were going - us and other guest thought we'd end up stuck on the roof. Wow, this was by far the worst hotel experience I have ever had.

The check in line was redic so I just said eff it and took the 2 queen beds. On the plus side, my fiance and I both had our own bed lol. Our room light did not turn on, so we just used the 2 lamps for lighting thinking no biggie! Lol I should've known..


OMG! So my fiance and I woke up to a jackhammer at 7:45am this morning. I was pretty annoyed considering we drove 8 hours to get here and needed some much needed sleep. Called the front desk, the gal said said she was unaware of the situation and would contact someone to see whats going on. Lol oh ok...so then I decide to just be awake for the day.

About 30min later,  I flushed the toilet and the toilet begins to overflow causing the bathroom floor to be soaked in water. I call the front desk, maintenance guy comes and fixes it. The maintenance guy left me with a wet bathroom floor with probably god knows what on it. I guess he just expected me to go about the day with a wet floor? He could have at least called housekeeping or brought back towels. I heard on his radio that the A\/C was broken in 6 rooms..so he was busy, couldn't be that mad! So I am not going barefoot in the bathroom because I do not want to catch Aids. 

It's now 11:15am and the jackhammer is still going. Lol, I'm really trying to stay positive and but am thinking of staying somewhere else tonight. At least they can give me some type of comp or something for this crazy morning. Can't imagine if I was hungover, I'd be so pissed...but am trying to be a good sport about everything.

Moral of the story, invest your money in getting a better hotel. Cheap is not always better. Wish I would have paid the $250 to stay at the Cosmo or Cesars instead of paying $140 for 2 nights at the Flamingo.

Last week we reserved a ""mini suite"" thinking we were getting an even better room. Not so much.  the hallways getting to the room are gross.  My husband made the mistake of walking down the hall in his socks to get ice.  He stepped in a PUDDLE in the carpet!  Torn carpet literally ""fixed"" with duct tape.  (To be fair, not all of the duct tape was silver.  Some of it was maroon to blend in with the 80s maroon-colored carpet). we made a reservation for a non-smoking room, but when we checked into our room it smelled badly of cigarette smoke. The TV options were barely even basic cable.  I love being able to watch movies in the room, but that wasn't even an option in this room.
The pool is nice, especially if you rent a cabana for shade, but about 12noon every day a techno-DJ starts blasting music at the pool.  It's so loud for the rest of the day that we left the pool at the end of the day hoarse from having to yell to hear each other.
There are really aggressive time share salespeople all over the lobby.  That doesn't usually bother me, but one day I started having a really bad eye allergy out at the pool.  By the time I walked inside to the lobby from the pool to get eye drops from our room, my eyes were completely swollen shut and I could barely see (super attractive).  Despite clearly having some kind of medical issue happening, one of these time share sales man started following me and pestering me to hear his spiel.  (I'm also in sales, so I'm usually pretty receptive to a good sales pitch, but my eyes felt like they were on fire and I had to get to my room to get eye drops!).
the deli stations are very good quality.

But really - This hotel has a bumping casino, multiple places to eat (umm the buffet options are reason enough to stay here), a great location (practically in the middle of the strip).

1) Customer service. We booked the FabDeluxe room on hotels.com mainly because the Flamingo is known for its wonderful pools. My sister is under 21 and the website did not clarify that there is only one small wading pool for people under 21. When we went to talk to management about this misleading information, the manager Ryan Ramsey was rude and stared blankly at me the whole time. He said that he would get us a pass to swim at Caesar's Palace but never did and wouldn't return our phone calls. We ended up checking out of the hotel the next day because it was 108 degrees and we just wanted to swim in a nice pool. It's just so disappointing that the Flamingo doesn't care about satisfying their customers. 

2) Dirty. It's one thing if the hotel is old, it's another thing if it is dirty. There was tape on the ceiling of our hotel room. The shower had hair in it. The pillows smelled terrible. The carpet was disgusting. The elevators didn't work and had graffiti in them. Terrible. I've stayed in 1 and 2 star hotels in Vegas that were cleaner. 

3) Check-in. Took forever and we ended up having to wheel our luggage through the hotel to get to the lobby then back through another part of the hotel to get to the elevators. Terrible design. Why would you have guests wheeling luggage over multiple flights of stairs?

4) Food. We had tickets for the buffet which was pretty good, except one of the chairs at our table had vomit-looking stains on it. Everything was broken and needed updating. Which is fine, but they clearly have no pride in their hotel. 

5) Noise. I heard the person above me sneeze all night long and the shower dripped water. 

Ultimately, this hotel is going down hill. There is no pride in ownership of this place. Everyone that works there looks unhappy and are not very pleasant to talk to. The exception to this was Fran at the front desk. She was pleasant. It's apparent the Flamingo doesn't care about its guests. The hotel has made no effort to maintain itself or keep up with a changing Las Vegas. My thought is that they are going to close within the the next few years and the owners are trying to get a couple more bucks out of it in the meantime. I would recommend any other hotel in Vegas. I even stayed in the Palace Station once and it was 50x better than this place. Avoid the Flamingo! They treat you like scum!",0,0,0

I have stayed at the Flamingo probably 10 or so times, and the rooms have always been nice. The view, however, was exceptional. Most of the time we had a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains, and it was great. It was really interesting to see from a higher view.

The pool at the Flamingo is very nice. It's a perfect 'laze away and tan' pool with scenic falls and nice foliage. I also enjoy the gardens and birds they have on site.

The location of the Flamingo is also nice, it is HARD to miss due to its illuminated bulb logo, and it's right in the center of the action. It's an older hotel, and the buffet and restaurants kind of show their age, but it's very relaxed and chill.

My husband and I checked into the Flamingo late (around 1am) Thursday night. Now, because I knew it was going to be a late check in I called a few days prior to let them know to save my room. When we arrived at the hotel there was a mere ten minute wait to check in. I was told they no longer had my non-smoking King room but offered me a smoking king room with a better view. Which was fine by me as I know the ventilation in these older hotels are hard to keep ""non-smoking"" anyways. They even waived two nights of resort fees for the ""inconvenience"". It was an older non upgraded ""FAB"" room but had a beautiful view of the Linq's high roller and flamingo habitat area. Nothing fancy but nothing was dirty or unappealing to us either. Beds were comfy with lots of soft pillows. The ONLY problem with the elevators was one elevator always seemed to ""fake-out"" and light up as if it was coming but never did. But I didnt mind as the actual elevator always arrived despite the false indication. I expected the worse based on the review I had read before my trip. Which is why I feel strongly to write the review as THEY WE NOT BAD! Our trip was originally booked to check out Sunday morning by 11am. However, on Saturday my husband wasnt feeling well so I stopped by the front desk to reserve an extra room so we could check out later (late check out and extra room was the same price). Our flight on Sunday wasnt until night so we didnt want to have to check out until around 6PM. Around 3PM on Sunday I unexpectedly was approached by the housekeeping manager (whom was very nice ) she said I had to check out because they were closing the 11th floor for deep cleaning. I shocked told her I reserved an extra night so I didnt have to check out early, she apologized so the fact I was not told this and booked an extra night anyways. She called down to the front desk to explain what happened and made sure they were aware that this was not my fault so I would receive a full refund of the extra night I booked. I checked out around 3:30 PM that day and was given a complete refund of my reservation, resort fees, and tax for the extra night ($95) which out having to cause a fuss. It actually worked out pretty well for us seeing as we still got a ""free"" extra 4+ hours in our room and the remaining two hours we were able to chill out by the pool before heading to the airport. I received my deposit and credits back to my card within three business days. (Side note, there is a review below a ways complaining about the $50 security deposit. Which should be noted every single hotel has a security deposit and it does get refunded quickly after check out).

They did send up bathroom supplies in a bag later, brought a remote, and then attempted to make the sink work but it only lasted a short time.  Got another roll of toilet paper on the second day.

I intended to contact them first before placing a Yelp review but they have no ""contact us"" on their site.

We were there for a conference, so I tried to order room service breakfast to save time in the morning, only to find out they are only open for orders from 6 a.m. to 1 p.m. and of course you can't get in your room until 4 p.m.  Front desk person said they had a 24\/7 coffee shop so we could have an early breakfast there.  So, we looked for it that evening to no avail.  Found a staff person who told us that the coffee shop had closed that day for good.  Never did find anyplace to go to get a ""regular"" breakfast.

In the conference center where our meetings were held, first thing we noticed was all the carpet was held together with duck tape all throughout the ""executive"" conference areas.

Went to make coffee in our room first morning and discovered we only were given enough coffee to make one cup, so we shared.
Have stayed in lots of hotels over the years, and this was a real experience.

The first morning a loud voice came into our room like an air raid siren stating there was an alarm and more information to come.  We quickly got dressed and got our things together,  The alarm message kept coming into our room but no details, very scary.  We are older and have health issues so scared of going down 26 flights of stairs.  After what seemed like quite some time, they made an announcement that the Alarm message was cancelled.  Of course, no problem if it was real, but turned out it was not - see below.

Later I asked a staff person.  First she said it was probably a ""test.""  I mentioned that it started at 5 a.m., which seemed like an unusual time for a ""test.""  Her response was someone probably accidently started it - that it happened quite often.  We were seriously scared.  Think that is something they should look into if it really does happen ""quite often.""

Duck tape on the carpet is one thing, but scaring people with heart conditions at 5 a.m. ""by accident"" is quite another.

Based on the condition of the hotel and the rooms, I am wondering if there are financial problems.  Stayed in nicer rooms in motels along I-5 on car trips!

Have stayed in many of the hotels over the years in Las Vegas but never had an experience like this for sure.  One positive comment, every staff person we encountered was pleasant and friendly - no problems there.  Which I would say is lucky because they probably have to deal with a lot of complaints.

Perhaps that is why they do not have a ""contact us"" area on their website!",0,0,0

And last year's experience at check-in was even worse, but unfortunately, I agreed to give it one more try.  If you want to spend your time gambling, go somewhere else.

The food, and the customer service in the restaurant was good. I did not stay at the hotel, so I was unable to experience the rooms. My guess is if the rooms look like the hotel, they're probably nice - but again, I can't be sure unless sleeping in them. My experience in the Casino was okay - I didn't see anything completely different than other casinos that cater to similar cliental. Accommodation was a bit frustrating. Sometimes you come to Las Vegas as a family - there are kids things to do in Las Vegas outside of the casinos. 
My sister-in-law could not find a restroom with a changing table for her child. To me, this is a simple accommodation the hotel could provide. So, my niece was changed on the counter - this garnered a few ""side eye"" looks from other patrons.

We did not experience a long wait for checking in or checking out so that was nice. However, we did experience the long wait times for an elevator Sunday morning when we were going to check out...that is the only time we had to wait for an elevator. It does seem like only half of the elevators work.

Our room was clean. Floors were clean. Bed sheets were clean. We had a nice view of the hotel pool & the high roller from our room on the 7th floor. 

Although I was bummed about NO WIFI, & NO FRIDGE IN THE ROOM, and really bad lighting, I was trying to stay positive.

Breakfast buffet is affordable and has many options. Price is relatively cheap. Rooms are clean and the views are nice. Check in and check out is easy. Most of the staff is very polite.

Cons: They recently started charging for parking, which I would be okay with if the garage was remotely nicer. The elevators in the parking garage are dirty and slow.

The check-in\/ check-out line was absurdly long. For how many people were working at the front desk, it seems that the line should have moved at least 6 or 7x quicker than it actually did. Not sure what the holdup was, but from the lady's expression, this seemed to be normal. Yikes. 

Our room was decent- not quite up to what I would consider normal hotel standards, but it was alright, because we really were only looking for a clean place to rest our heads. The room was lacking almost all amenities. Very different from what we saw online when booking our room. Updates haven't been made here in quite some time and it is VERY obvious.

Please keep in mind I've stayed there before and did not have any issues, hence why we stayed here again. Well everything started off crappy when we got to the hotel and were informed that the hotel did not have our reservations. So in order to stay there we had to give a credit card number to cover charges for that night, since this was a holiday weekend they charged the going rate which was well over $200\/night (no way is any room at the Flamingo worth over $200\/night).. We were told that the hotel was going to get a hold of Travelocity to confirm the stay and everything should be taken care of after that. 

The following morning we go down to the front desk and were advised that the hotel was not able to get a hold of anyone at Travelocity. So we contacted Travelocity directly and they informed us that they faxed over the appropriate paperwork twice and that the confirmation number that we had on our reservation and that WE provided to the hotel when we got there was the one that was originally provided by the Flamingo so they had no idea why the hotel did not enter our reservation into their system. We informed the hotel manager, Andre, that Travelocity had submitted the fax. He claimed he did not have it, so we called Travelocity AGAIN and stayed with them on the phone as they faxed over the paperwork to the Flamingo AGAIN. Once we confirmed the hotel got all of the necessary paperwork, WE were told to check later in the day or the following day to make sure reservation was entered in their system and that they room was charged to Travelocity and not us. Fine whatever (this is now day two of dealing with this mess). So we checked and were advised everything was OK. (We also had to go down to the desk EVERYDAY and get a new set of keys because for whatever reason, ours expired every 24 hours)

Our last morning at the Flamingo and we go to check out and we are asked for a credit card so that they can charge the last night stay since it was not covered by Travelocity. At this point, all niceness was out the door. Our reservation clearly stated how long we booked our room for and for the Flamingo to screw up entering our reservation for a SECOND time was unacceptable. We refused to give any credit card information as this screw up was theirs not ours. We also had a flight to catch that morning and did have time for Flamingo to figure this mess out last minute, which was CLEARLY their fault from the beginning. We demanded to see Andre the manager we were originally dealing with and (shocker) he was unavailable as he was on vacation. The other manager was spoke with Aaron went to his office or whatever and sent out one of the front desk ladies who advised us we can go and that they will have to figure this out with Travelocity.

So bottom line, WE had to deal with and stress over this reservation thing for the 4 days we were there, WE had to call Travelocity and have them resend paperwork to Flamingo, and WE had to demand that they straighten out this mess and check daily to make sure that the Flamingo staff was doing their job. 

It is very clear that the Front desk staff at the Flamingo and their management has no clue what is going on nor do they know how to properly troubleshoot their issues. This should never have been a situation where we the customer had to do all the leg work. We came in there with proper paperwork, confirmation numbers, etc. Flamingo is a joke, their management is a bigger joke, and I will never stay there and will make sure that everyone I know never stays there.

Check in takes forever and the customer service staff were not welcoming at all. Day one my friend's phone, credit card, and ID were stolen at The Flamingo Pool. We were able to cancel the card, buy a new phone, but not having an ID for her to get into places ruined the trip. Pool security is only there for show. They do a thorough search of you going in the pool but not going out. Hotel security was even less helpful....saying they would not be looking at camera surveillance. Police do nothing in that city besides turn a blind eye. The phone had not been turned off and we could track the location with ""Find my iPhone"" and still the police were unbothered and unwilling to help with a stolen identity. The Flamingo only use surveillance for their own benefit. Wifi costs extra and is still so slow. The carpets are filthy and everyone who stays there looks very low class. Housekeeping would not give us fresh towels or bag liners since we did not want them in our room after the theft at the pool. By the way no one followed up with us after the theft and we went out of our way to make sure they had our contact information in case at least the ID showed up. Our dirty towels laid in the hallway for days since housekeeping wouldn't take them from us. Walls are paper thin and you can hear everything next door which of course was disgusting. An alarm was blaring for hours next door and the front desk did nothing after we called them and physically walked down to complain. No vents in the bathroom....it was clogged and moldy. When we went to complain about how horrible our stay was we got a business card with the wrong information on it to contact someone. The e-mail was invalid.

I was there for the CONEXPO, this is the convention that makes CES look small. My company organized the hotel situation. When I learned that we were at the Flamingo I confess I let out a gasp. Not my first choice. 

I arrived a bit before my clients, so I could check everybody in and set up the rooms accordingly. I was greeted by something of a concierge who ushered me around the waiting throng of people. Must have been all the logo gear I was toting around( I work for one of the largest domestic manufacturers in the world). They proceeded to spit out all the room keys and the associated materials. I went up, room by room to place all the swag I had for my clients. I got to the room they had assigned for me, oh my heck. My group was 22 rooms and then mine. I had the 2 story suite with the living area and the associated facilities. I had never expected any of this. The staff brought the rest of my stuff to me, unpacked all of my things and never said boo about something for the effort, dropped the lead bellman a c-note for his time and effort. The whole thing reminded me of old Vegas, back when I would stay at the DI, sit at the Black Jack table for a few hours and get a free room. The room was so well set up we ended up using it as a hospitality suite.

We stayed here because we read the Flamingo has one of the top 10 pools and it was my birthday ""girls"" trip. We arrived at 3pm and check in wasn't until 4pm. Can we check in early? If we want to pay a $15 fee or buy a room upgrade to check in early. The cashier was a real snoot about it too. I said we were excited to get to the pool and wasn't there a vacant room only one hour early? Nope (BS). So we wandered around on principal alone and checked out the scene. The pool was crazy busy and we saw a sign saying the pool was open 10am-6pm. 6pm?? I stopped and asked the security guard who said that when its ""in season"" they'll close at 7pm but for now its 6pm. In season??? Its June! Its 105 friggin degrees! 7?? Thats still too early!! We could have stayed at the Gold Nugget and swam next to sharks till 11pm every night! So then we wait till 4 to check in, and the bell guy of course can't get the dang luggage to the room (probably due to the huge amount of luggage dispersed at 4:01pm) until about 445 pm. Needless to say, day 1 - no pool. 
NEXT. the toilet spun\/flushed itself every 11-14 minutes (we timed it while we waited for the Bell boy) and the pipes groaned so I called and asked hotel to come fix it. There was no way to turn the water off because the knob was gone. The man who answered was a smart ass and I thought he was blowing smoke up my..ya know... and yep he was. That night we returned from our outing with the toilet flushing and whining. Next day I called and asked if they'd checked it out. The lady who answered said there was no request for a fix. Of course. So I don't know if it got fixed. 
We went out to eat for breakfast at the cafe thinking of getting something light. The food was small and cost just as much as the buffet. At least the coffee was decent.

Let me start off by saying that I only stayed here because my entire family did. I struggled with booking this hotel based on the reviews and for the cost. I booked through the hotels website, it was the same price as all of the ""booking"" sites. We could have stayed at a 5 star hotel for what we paid. 

We arrived before check in time (4pm) so we paid for an early check in ($20). It was worth it. The Flamingo sent me an email and I did it that way. I also got a pre-check in email that allowed me to skip the long check in line when I got there so that was a total win! 

The hotel is pretty run down. The elevators are wonky, you may be trapped in one. Our room wasn't bad at all. It had been renovated but the bathroom had not. We don't spend much time in the bathroom so it wasn't too awful but at the price you pay to stay at this hotel you expect certain standards. Our maid was great. 

*It smelled like cigarette smoke in our non smoking room. It was seeping in from the vent in the bathroom. It was awful.

The pool was a lot of fun! Great music, clean, and there was active security. Only downfall- not enough seating. We just put our towels at the edge of the pool and hung out there. It was what everyone was doing. I didn't mind it. You aren't allowed to bring any food\/drink in but it's like that everywhere. 

We really liked that it was located by the Linq and its new ""strip"" it was great. Clean and lots of shops, restaurants, etc.

Unfortunate events that occurred while staying:

1. On our second day the hotel alarm went off probably 4 times. They came over the speaker and said they were researching what was happening and it came back as all clear. All 4 times. It was really loud but whatever. 

2. My uncle got trapped yes TRAPPED in an elevator for over an hour with 15 people in it! They were stuck between floors and the fire department had to come and get them out. They had to be rescued lol just like in the movies. He wasn't given any comps or anything like that. 

3. The  water softener went out in the entire hotel. So if you were taking a shower anytime in the morning you wouldn't be clean. Shampoo wouldnt rinse out soap would stay on your body.  

Stay somewhere else if you could. Like I said, we only stayed here because our whole family did.",4,1,0

We had a nice view of the Strip (including the Bellagio fountains). Good comfy beds. Decent bathroom (though, no tub, just a shower). The decor was decent too. No robes, no minibar. But for a place to rest your head at night in Sin City, you could do way worse. And it's a pretty good central location too.

However, there isn't much else to do at the Flamingo. There's a couple of ok shows, but it ends there. The restaurant options are sucky. Room service is no more than 2 stars. The stores are sucky. Etc.

So for the right price, it's a good room, but not much else.

And then, of course, there's the issue that the valet lost our car keys. Yep, lost our car keys. What are the friggin' odds of that happening? Either way, can't say I would recommend valeting your car here. Why take that gamble?

Q: Ew. What's wrong with the Flamingo?
A: I'm pretty sure they get their distinct color from the shrimp that they eat. If they're not eating fresh shrimp, they're not pink. If you're asking about the Hotel\/Casino, then there's nothing wrong with it. Great location, awesome history (Bugsy!), great prices, solid pool, clean, comfortable, vegas, baby, vegas.

Q: Remember that time when everything shocked you? Literally?
A: Yah! It gets really dry (it's a dry heat) and I would shock myself on every metal object.

Q: A new coat of paint could help this place, no?
A: I mean, sure, your face could use a new coat of paint too. Simply put, the Flamingo is in a great location, a good place to stay, clean, comfortable, home. Okay, not quite home. But, say, a home away from home!

FYI ... Don't come back from a night of drinking, start playing Caribbean Stud while the sun starts to come up, standing and leaning slightly against the table so you won't tip over, tell the dealer that you'll play her game ""you rogue"" and throw cards towards her (not AT her, mind you), Flamingo security doesn't take kindly to that sort of behavior.

Listen, everyone is grouchy at 6.30am.",2,2,2

Also, I am a poker player, so I will also review the poker room as well. 

The Flamingo has a long history in Las Vegas. Originally opening in 1946 then closing and reopening in 1947, it was the 3rd resort on the Strip and is one of the very few remaining original old school properties. The original buildings have all been torn down and what remains has been remodeled several times. The current casino and hotel rooms are pretty modern, though there is definitely an aura of ""Vintage Las Vegas"" throughout. 

The poker room is comfortable and nicely situated for walk-by traffic and is located near a Strip entrance. Though it is quite far from self parking, it still is one of the only rooms that offers consistent 2\/4 LHE on the Strip. It also offers the standard 1\/2NL. The comp rate is $1\/hour and the rake is the Caesars Entertainment standard of 10%\/$5 max plus $1 jackpot. 

The front desk always seems to have a gargantuan line at night, with several guests just sitting on the floor in the lobby waiting for their group to check in. This creates a lot of crowds in the front desk area. 

The casino has a fairly low ceiling but offers a variety of the standard carnival games, 21, and dice. Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville is a popular bar hangout with a balcony that overlooks the strip. 

As far as dining, we liked the Steakhouse but the Mexican restaurant is horrible. The café is pretty standard though a bit overpriced. There is a beautiful outdoor courtyard with a view of live Flamingos, which is a nice feature. Self parking is pretty inconvenient as it requires a pretty long walk but is sufficient. 

All in all, I do recommend Flamingo for a nice center-strip middle market property. Plus, they are part of the Caesars Entertainment Total Rewards program which is easily the best loyalty program in the industry.",11,0,0

When we arrived, there were people sitting in the lobby and the self check in was down. We were notified by a hotel employee that the entire system was down and there was no way to know when the system would come back up.


After about 30 mins, we were given the option to drag out luggage down to be locked up until our room was ready. Now...we flew from Ohio and had a layover at ATL..so needless to say, the last thing we wanted to do was sit in the lobby. But now we have the option to take our own luggage downstairs.

...okay...

Some more time goes by and we are offered room temperature bottled water. Still sitting on the floor in the lobby..

Around that time, we were given the option to leave a phone number and receive a call when the system comes back up. We opt for that, but still stay in the lobby.

After 2 hours, and no phone call, we see people using the self check in and people flooding to the check in line. So we get in line and wait..and wait..and finally go to check in. 

We are not offered any compensation, so we ask. 

We are offered a $50 food and beverage credit. For 3 people to use. We ask for additional compensation towards our room, but we are told no. After 2 ""managers"" and my friend insisting that we receive an apology\/compensation, we are finally offered a $75 food and beverage credit, and a $75 credit applied to our stay. We made it into our room by midnight. 

One of the issues I have is the lack of apology and the use of statements like ""I see you're upset"" ""I know you're upset"" etc. those are isolating statements-like I know that YOU'RE upset, but I don't accept any part in this, and I think you're overreacting. It was almost like we were shamed for asking to be compensated. 

Our room was a smoking room. Which wasn't that bad. But there were missing room signs all over the hallways and the numbers were written in sharpie. The hallways were trashy. There was a fruit bowl sitting outside of a room for 2 days and every time I walked past it, there was more fruit missing. I still don't understand that. 

Our room also wasn't cleaned for 2 days. Had to ask for towels and for our room to be cleaned.

Cons-
Most upsetting were all the hidden fees after you arrive, if you are the regular folk without special gambling status.  Whatever you pay for the room, you can add another $42+ for each day you stay if you drive to Las Vegas.  Internet hookup is bad.

We used the kiosks and avoided the long 30+ min wait time, make sure you have the confirmation number or you won't be able to get a room.  We did get a random $100 dollar charge prior to check out but it all ended up okay.
Room
We got the fab deluxe room which is their standard room.  There is definitely a very long walk from the elevator to our room, which could be due to the kiosks.  So if you decide to wait in the lines,  I would request a room closer to the elevators.  We got lucky and got the rooms for $35-$40 a night.  The rooms were clean, to an extent.  But I did later notice that the sheets had some dirt marks on them. The beds were both sunk in and also very squeaky.  Also in the shower, there was a random hole in the top corner of the bathtub which was weird.

They also have some birds near the pools that smell really bad, it was cool but nothing that you absolutely must do.

The room smelled like it had OD'd on Calvin Klein CK One, and a chair was turned over in a sinister, random fashion. I advanced cautiously through the room by the variable light from the giant pink neon Flamingo sign on the wall just outside... not wanting to turn on the lights. There seemed to be someone in the bed! ""Hey, wake up."" I shook the unmoving form cautiously, but there was something wrong. I pulled back the covers. It was a dead guy. 

Okay, I made that up. There wasn't a dead guy in the bed... not even a mint (unless I didn't notice it), but everyone needs an exciting Las Vegas story. My entire stay was rather drab and uneventful, so I thought I'd better make something up for the benefit of the people I had to borrow money from to get back to New York. Some nagging journalistic code, however, prevents me from not coming clean... I know I should just get over it. 

The room at the Flamingo could have been a Holiday Inn just outside of Kansas City except for the view... the view, to the west, Caesar's Palace, The Palms, then mountains, was what I was paying for. They may as well not have bothered with curtains, as far as I was concerned, or a TV. The window took up the whole wall, and it was worth the price of admission, 24 hours a day. 

The rest of the hotel I could do without. Every time I walked into the lobby, whether it was midnight, daytime, or breakfast-time, Eighties rock was blasting from the sound system. I guess they know their audience, but come on, what happened to Sinatra? If I want to be constantly serenaded by the crooning of STING, I'll check into a room in HELL. 

Of course, there is also the endless drone of electronic slot machines, whether real or manufactured... and I guess nothing here is real... but anyway, that sound is ever-present everywhere in Las Vegas, and if you can't stand that sound you'll probably end up doing something inappropriate. I sort of like it, at least it occasionally distracted me from the Eighties rock.

I went for a three day weekend for my birthday a trip to LV from NY and i knew this time around i had to be in the middle of the strip. last time i was here i stayed at excalibur also not  a bad place but defianatly to far down the strip for my taste.

FLAMINGO FAB LUXURY ROOM: NOT bad at all this is why;
1. My room was cleaned everyday i was there and i had fresh towels
2.i stayed in the habitat tower not sure if there are any other towers but this tower was close to all exits to move around easily.
3. the decor is what it is updated to an extent but really lets be serious how much TIME do you really spend in your room in vegas?
4. i did understand the old bathroom reviews for this room and i did see the chiped paint and wished there was a fan in the bathroon (i hate a foggy mirror) but again for a short fun weekend jumping in and out a shower before hitting the strip takes under an hour right? i loved the full leghth mirror in the bathroom while getting ready great feature for anyone.
5. ok so my view of the strip from my FAB Luxury room was not the most fab i was able to see ceasars across the street a bit of the mirage and a bit or the street again i was not wasting my fun time in a room glaring out a window instead of being outside. i did liked the fact that i can see club PURE which i hit up from my room window before going :).

So the food court not bad there are a ton of places to eat in vegas but when you just want to have some wings or a good burger Johny Rocket was ther to save the day for me. i tried the BUFFET at the FLAMINGO for BREAKFAST and let me just say IDK what is wrong with people and there reviews but its really hard to mess up breakfast. The buffet was not bad it was not fabulous but it was ok be prepared to wait on a line for that as well, as everyone has stated the best part is grabing a seat by the windows to enjoy the early sunshine and koi fish swinmming around great view to start the day.

THE FLAMINGo GO POOL:

1. i read the reviews to go early i did and grabed 2 seats left something on them and when i came back my stuff was gone and someone took our seats than argued with us smh if you know me security had to be called :\/ but offered me any 2 seats for the next morning and i could come down after the early morning rush and have the seats i want thanks Mr. Security guard( i didt make it down the next day but thanks).

2. the water was a bit colder than i expected.
3. i did not see any beer bottle are cups floating around the pool.
4. Music was  not bad not great but not the worst.
5. Didt stay for the booty shaking contest and the party crowd i was expecting was not as live as i was anticipating.

Overall not a bad place to stay in the middle ofthe strip the staff was friendly and i had easy checkout with a guy with an ipad it took less than a minute to check out and drop my cards in a little box, i was also givin a free hour longer for check out which worked out great :)",2,0,0

A non fab double queens with a leaking faucet in the shower and a non draining sink. The description and pictures were not anywhere close to what you actually get. 

The doors are either chipped on the bottom or dogs have chewed on the doors. Smudges on the headboards, that could be anything. Damage to the shades on the lamps. Bathroom towels were thin and had holes. 

The comforter could be anything but.  Both beds had dog hair and human hair between the layers.  Super itchy as well. I guess what can you expect from low rates.  

Layer of dust on the night stand lamp. Cracks in the ceiling and in the hallway leading to our room from the elevator there was water damage starting from the ceiling and going down to the baseboards. The curtains have stains. The shower curtain had DRIED BOOGERS!! So disgusting...

No you do not get a welcome treat or food\/ water bowls. Thank goodness I brought my own. I have pretty well behaved dogs, but I wonder about some pet owners who let their dogs do whatever they want. The front desk guy was surprised that I brought my own crates. 

No handy hotel information binder like most hotels offer.  I couldn't find anywhere to issue complaints. The Guest Services gal was not helpful and she didn't care that there were issues with the room. Right now it sounds like it is pouring inside the bathroom. What a waste!!

For me to pay $125 for one night, it better be good and it wasn't. Back up at valet and registration. So then cars were getting unloaded in the middle of the thru way. People pulling illegal u-turns. Parking garage being mainly made up of valet spaces.  Check in took over 30 minutes, couldn't use the kiosk self check in. 

These rooms are in serious need of a remodel and repairs. This is unacceptable.",2,0,0

Negatives-
elevators take forever and the doors close quickly

There was a shower with side jets and a separate bath tub. The walls were pink\/white and the ceiling had a fun pink lighting with a mirror. The mirror in the bathroom had a tv in it.

We came out here for a friend's birthday and it was great because we were pretty much in the middle of all the clubs we wanted to go to!

One bad thing I have to say is definitely the service and this is based on one lady at the front desk when we first checked in. She wasn't very pleasant and treated us like we didn't know anything. We initially reserved two rooms under one name but the website asked for another name (which we thought was for emergency purposes) but it actually reserved a room under each name which didn't make sense. She then found out we had another room but after we had to tell her and our rooms were down the hall and around the corner from each other. It wasn't a big deal, but she could have cancelled the transaction and put us next to each other..but she didn't.

I've been a loyal customer of Caesar's Entertainment for many years and have never had an issue until last week during our visit to the Flamingo. It was supposed to be a fun trip to celebrate my husbands birthday. When we got to our room, we found it to be extremely outdated (even though we paid for an upgrade) and the carpet was stained and dirty. We were moved to a different room which had a little cleaner carpet but soon found that the sink was clogged. Not a good start. 

We made our way down to the casino and we were playing video poker. My husband was seated two machines down from me. He asked me to sit at the machine next to him so I walked over and then quickly realized I didn't get my voucher. When I looked over, my voucher was gone -- stolen within a matter of seconds. I called security who reviewed the security footage. They said the voucher was cashed within minutes and they recognized the man who stole it. They wouldn't give me any other information but told me to call their loss department. I did that and was basically told that I was out of luck. 

I told Cesar's that I thought their security was lacking and that I didn't feel safe. I proved my point by experiencing two further incidents. I was approached by a shady looking man trying to sell me something. Then a different man sat at the machine next to me and was so angry he was losing that he started to pound the machine with his fist all while spouting obscenities.  All this with security no where in sight.

The first night we went pretty hard and needed to grab some eats; we headed to carlos n charlies (i think because it was the first food place i saw out of the elevator...) and ordered a chicken quesadilla and a cheeseburger. That was a $42 dinner. The next day I enjoyed a $13 lunch (for panda express type stuff). Pretty redic

Oh, you cant bring outside food or drink to the pool, NO BUENO. The drinks are $17-$24. And even if you buy it in the 'souvenir' cup you cant bring that cup back in the next day, you have to get a new one. Thats pretty weak yo. 

I've also never experienced a louder hotel room. We were on the 17th floor and could hear the street traffic all night. The floors are hardwood so maybe that played a roll but it was an odd sound since most of those hotels have sound proof windows...

Two rooms were booked back in February and we chose the Flamingo because we like to stay at a different hotel every time we go to Vegas. BIG MISTAKE!

First, We got there at about 2pm and tried to check in. After hearing that they charged $35 for an early check in fee, we decided to wait. As they collected credit card information from us, they also asked if my sister and I wanted connecting doors. We were stoked we could all be connected and they told us to come back from 4-6pm to get our room keys. We came back shortly after 4 to find my sister's room ready and ours was not. We found this strange since the rooms are right next door. We put our belongings in her room and went to walk the strip.

We came back at 7pm, only to find out that they had a problem with the locks in the room they had saved for us and they could put us in a room with one bed. I had 4 guests staying in one room with ONE BED! They offered us a cot, and told us we could move to a room with two beds the next morning. After speaking to the manager about my frustrations, he told us to come back the next afternoon to switch our rooms but everything would be taken care of. 

Saturday morning comes around, The day of my Birthday when I planned on spending the entire day poolside with drinks. At about 1pm I went to the concierge desk to get my other room and there wasn't a room available yet. They then told me to come back at 3 to check if it's ready. At this point, I was livid because it was taking time away from my birthday celebration so we said screw it and decided to stay in our room the remainder of the weekend. Luckily, I had understanding friends who didn't mind the cot, but this whole situation was a huge hassle and a complete waste of time. 

Not only was this process annoying, but the room was disgusting. Our sink was clogged the whole weekend and it smelled horrible. Also, to get towels was a huge pain in the ass because if you asked a house keeper they responded with ""you need to call the front desk to put in an order"" excuse me? I am vacationing at your hotel and you want ME to call the front desk. Not acceptable.

The only enjoyable memory of my stay at the Flamingo was the crowd at the pool and my bartender Rigo! He was awesome, made strong drinks and he was a great time. He made my birthday complete!

As for the rest of the hotel and casino, I will never return.",2,2,2

#1 the damn keys- they never fucking worked!!!!
(And we have hotel experience -we know not to put them agasint other cards-celluar devices- etc
The first two days we walked our happy asses down to the lobby  (fyi it's a fucking hike-literally a 10 mile walk and back & with the shitty elevators oh my god u wanted to take a gun right there and blow your brains. The third night we used someone's room phone to call security to come open the door for us- no way in hell we were making that long brutal walk down there - and not to mention wait in a long fucking line - the last night we had to walk down there due to our phones being dead and no one's room door was open so we could of asked to use their phone,  we did see a staff lady and she just said ""oh just go to the lobby"" like it's no big deal. She could of used her walkie talkie to call security but NO her rude ass didn't )

#2 the fucking hallway carpets- duct tape all over and huge ripples in the carpet. We could of tripped and broke our necks- laughing but very fucking serious! !)

#3 trash everywhere - and a security person heard us and he mumbled to himself ""That's not my job""
Fucking d- bag

#4 the elevators i kinda mentioned in # 1. 1 elevator was busted- and then it always took forever to get a elevator to open. One time we waited about 10 minutes and that elevator was going up but we still hopped in it ee couldn't bare to wait another minute- so we took the ride all the way to the 28th floor and then all the way down to floor 1

#5 most of the staff we encountered were pretty rude. Especially the folks that work at the front desk

#6 we stayed in 2 different rooms - room 2 had luke warm water... not to mention the bathtubs in this joint are a dumpster-even the Riviera we stayed at 6 months ago had nice bathroom. Nice large tub. Laminated counters -etc etc 
 
Regardless of all this- it's vegas & vegas is always a good time. Met some cool funny people in the flamingo and of course had a blast on the strip. 
But will i stay here again? No thank you. Possibly provide me a scooter to to drive back and fourth in to get new keys every fucking day.

***(They did refund our resort fee so thanks for that)**

Do some updating on the furnishings 
Make sure there is not trash all over the hallways
And fix those damn carpets! Someone will break their neck or ankle

Ohhh and the ice maker closest to our room was busted -had to walk 10 miles to the next one.
And i guess one of the floors didn't have an ice maker because the guest in the elevator said he has to go a floor down to get ice.",0,0,0

I have been to LV 18 times now and find the Flamingo & Balley's to be the biggest dives on the strip. I will never stay here again. DON'T buy into the ""upgraded"" rooms (The Go rooms) as they only offer the following as an upgrade: coffee maker (that you will not drink from when you see it), mini fridge (that fits all of 4 cans of pop), and a pillowtop bed cover. All that and a little bigger bathroom that was last finished in the early 60's can be yours for $20+ per night (on top of the normal room rate). 
 I read on the web-site that they just did a renovation to the standard rooms and when I spoke to the guy at the front desk he told me to take the upgrade as I would be much happier with that room. I checked-in and quickly called the front desk to switch back to the standard room as I wasn't about to pay for that junk I wasn't going to use. Oh, and if you want to look out the window to the strip, grab some paper and poke a lot of small holes in it. Then put it up to any window in the house, then try to look though it. That is the view you will get as the entire front of the hotel is covered in dot matrix as a advertisement. 
 If you need a low cost, budget minded, not so clean place that is very well dated. Then the Flamingo is the place to stay.....
Oh, did I mention I found ants in my room.....20th floor room 20129. They live in the doorway between the hall and the room. 
 And be aware they cleaning people do NOT care if you have the DND sign on your door...

And from what I heard from everyone standing in line, if you buy from ANYONE other than Harrah's group online for reservations you must stand in long lines to check in and out! I booked on the Flamingo website and left my key in the room rather than standing in a 30+min. line just to sign my credit card bill. (That was the only plus of the trip)",0,0,0

For a supposedly ""old"" hotel, the Flamingo was surprisingly clean and brightly lit. And to my surprise -- it was crackin! The casino was always filled, people milling about.

Unfortunately, my high hopes soon fled after realizing there was no level of customer service. When we went to check in on late Friday night, the line was long and took forever. Now, I understand being an avid Vegas goer--lines will be long on Friday. But I'm amazed at how little concierges were available to welcome a heavy traffic flow. There were about three concierges total, by far the lowest I've seen at any hotel. It took far longer than necessary to get through.

Rooms were surprisingly new...until you got to the bathroom. There is also no coffee pot (they charge you $12 through room service if you want one...$12!!!) and no microwave. If you want a cot, they charge you $33\/night. -__- 

When we asked for our rooms to be cleaned, they never came. Our sink got clogged, and guest services promised one to be sent over promptly. So we went out, expecting our rooms to be cleaned and sink unclogged. Neither was the case. Someone came 5 hours later to unclog our sink...wow.

Then we went back to the front desk to ask for a set of extra keys. We were the only people in line but it took a good 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge us. When we neared the desk, a nearby concierge told us to back away because the lady he was helping was taking out her credit card (understandable). Then I heard him chuckle to her, ""they were standing just a little too close! Can't be standing that close!"" Yes, because the first thing on our minds is identity theft.

If it weren't for the cheap rates that particular weekend, I would have been far more unhappier. Although my main purpose in Vegas is not chillin' in my room, I expected better from an establishment that supposedly boasts hospitality.",7,1,0

My huge complaint is that we were given a room overlooking the strip, which seemed all right at first until we tried to go to sleep around midnight and were kept awake until 3:30 or so by the unbelievably LOUD, POUNDING club music.  Seriously, I thought the club was in our hotel and possibly even on the floor above us, that's how loud it was.  My husband is a super sound sleeper and even he was awake all night.  No amount of pillows on my head or even turning up the sound machine we had in the room for our toddler (yes I know, bringing a kid to Vegas is totally against the rules of a fun Vegas trip, but we were there for a wedding) could drown out the noise.  After sleeping a total of 2 hours before the baby woke us up at 6am, I called the front desk to complain and found out the music was coming from PURE Nightclub at Caesar's ACROSS THE STREET!  That's how loud the music was.  I sound like an old lady when I say this but holy crap, if you were in that club you are looking at hearing loss for days.  Ha.
The hotel was nice about switching our room, so we got a nice room facing the garden\/pool area and it was completely quiet at night and we actually slept.  They've got a major problem on their hands with those street facing rooms, I wish they would have given us a heads up about that since we had 2 kids with us.

We went to the family pool and they would not let my kids in with their snacks and water. They check every diaper bag as if we were hiding weapons. We wanted to go to the pool near the slide and 5 life guards said could not be there because there were no lifeguards on duty. I asked them if they could be there since there were no space for my kids to sit and play. They said no. After I left I watched these lifeguards talking and laughing with the security guard.

Our heater makes a loud clicking noise very similar to the sound of our door opening every time it comes on. That kept me awake.

First, the pros of this hotel is location!  It is smack dab in the middle of the popular strip and one has easy access to Caesars across the street, there is a Walgreens on both ends of the block, and if you get to stay in the Habitat towers, you have great views of the Omnia at night.  My room, the Fab Exec was amazingly roomy and comfortable.  The beds comfortable, and the shower\/bathroom nice.  Check-in process is quick when done by the kiosks and customer service here was good.

My second visit here, not so much.

Apparently, depending on what towers\/floors you are in, the rooms could differ vastly and it was reflected in the degenerating paint and bathroom with cracks in the wall and musty smelling shower curtains.  So while our first night there was comfortable (I requested the GO room for our first evening), imagine our horror in finding a bedbug walking on one of the beds, under the first sheet in the second room for the evening.  Our room was located on the 5th floor and instead of killing it, we decided to catch it and put it in one of the paper cups for evidence.  I have no idea, perhaps there was more of them under the mattress cover or perhaps it came up in the extra set of pillows\/sheets I had requested.

I called down to the front desk and was assisted by a clerk that was quite helpful.  She said she would have no problems in changing our rooms.  I asked her what would happen to that room after she asked if we would like to file a report.  She said that if we filed, it would be filed with their Risk Management office.  If we didn't file, nothing would happen.  So of course we filed and they sent security immediately upstairs to take the report.  I also gave him the cup that held the little bugger for evidence.

When we went downstairs, the next clerk at the counter was extremely rude, for reasons unknown.  And threw the new key at us.  Apparently she didn't get the memo that we were to be assisted immediately without having to stand in line.  That being said, we were accommodated and given new rooms that were actually nicer than the previous ones.

I'm not freaking out about the situation since we were not bitten plus this is not the first time I've seen a bedbug (I saw these on a homeless person's belongings out on the street once) plus my classes in Entymology has prepped me for exposure to segmented parasites, but I sure hope this hotel, one of the few historic ones remaining on the strip, fumigated that room.

At the very least, they should have given us one night free.

On the flip side, I won money on one of the slot machines so that was a nice return on the bedbug investment, hehe",18,8,6

When an attendant finally got to us (15 mins later), he called for a bell hop. The bell hop took another 15 minutes to show up to our car. Now, I'm standing outside of the car in 100 degree weather waiting for the bell hop to get to my car. I'm a good tipper and I tipped the valet attendant $10 hoping he'd get the bell hop quick but no luck. Anyways he finally shows up, gets our bag and I head to check in. I get to the check in area and the line is super long. For a second, I thought I was in line for a Disneyland ride. However, my wife and I ditched the line, got into the rewards line and filled out for a card. This allowed us to get into the rewards check in line. Turned out to be a 15 minute wait instead of 2 hours in the regular line. At the check in, I do the $20 sandwich trick and it worked! Got upgraded to a cosmopolitan suite!!
So we head to our room. Luckily the elevator in the spa tower worked unlike the other ones in the other towers. No elevator issues for us! Get to our suite and it is amazing.  It was huge, great view and clean. Sort of...we open the mini fridge and there's a left over sandwich in there. Looks like the maids forgot something. Anyways we call the bell desk to bring up our luggage. Guess what? We had to wait over an hour to get our bags. No biggie, we can wait since we're inside the room now. My family meets us up in our suite and we order 2 buckets of beer to kick off the weekend.  Surprisingly the beers came within half an hour. Not bad I thought. So we head to the buffet after we settled in and got our luggage.  Buffet wasn't that great for the price they charge ($30) or something, but we wanted to dine as a family so we went. I tipped the cashier $20 and she gives us diamond access and complimentary wine for all of us (we had a party of 8). The food was very mediocre.  For the price we paid, I figured we'd have more choices of food, but it was horrible. 
Overall the weekend was fun. We were forced to use the under 21 age pool since my niece was with us but it wasn't bad. They still served food and alcohol there and we didn't have to deal with the over packed ""adult"" pool. So I gave it a three star since I got a cool upgrade.  If not it would be a 2 star review. 

Bad things I experienced:
Long valet and bell hop wait times
Bad buffet
Ice machine and soda machine didn't work on our floor
Elevator always had spilled beer or something in it
Long check in line

Good things I experienced:
Awesome room upgrade. Shower had mid body jets and a TV in the mirror! 
Fun pool area (non ""adult"" side). Great pool side food and drinks
Good place for slots. Won a few times
Pizza place stays open late and it was good!

I reluctantly made reservations to stay at Flamingo hotel after my cousin assured me the hotel had been renovated, otherwise, I would have never dreamt of staying in a dump like this. Because we were attending a wedding and my daughter was the flower girl, we had to bring the kids so we needed to stay in a hotel with a great pool. When I looked up on the website, and the pool looked great.  I called the hotel and specifically asked the concierge if the pool shown in the website with the waterfalls would allow children and he told me that the pool did indeed allow children.  

Once we got to Las Vegas, we found out the valet service was full.  We were also informed that the parking structure serving Flamingo is also full.  We asked a parking attendant where to go, and he shrug his shoulder and said:  ""don't know what to tell ya.  It took my husband 2 hours to come back from parking the car.  They quickly sell you a room but they don't provide you with the parking.

Our room was supposed to be non-smoking.  However, the smell of smoke was unbearable. Walking down the hall I found cigarette butts in all the ash trays and some on the floors which never got picked up.   

The next day we went to the pool. Kids were so excited to go to the pool but we found out that the pool for the kids is the small pool and the wonderful pool with the water falls is for people over 21.  I was livid.  I felt I had been tricked.  

The next morning at 6 a.m. I woke up with to find our room flooded. My interactions with the hotel staff regarding this incident were so upsetting that I told my husband we should leave a day early and go home.  Not only they were not apologizing for the inconvenience, they were a bit cocky,  Only the manager was sympathetic.  THE WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED FROM A HOTEL.

We agreed on this hotel for the price and the location. The location is excellent, right on the strip across from Caesar's Palace. We booked a remodeled GO king room with a High Roller View - huge difference between the GO and the FAB rooms. Our friend booked a FAB room, and there was electrical wiring sticking out of the wall, very dated decor and furnishings and just looked a bit dingy. BUT they're less expensive, so if you're on a budget it'll do just fine.The GO rooms are remodeled, but the carpet still looked dirty and even the ""high end"" decor and furnishings looked cheap. The shower was huge, but the shower head was tiny and the body sprays are weak. There was a tv mounted behind the glass in the bathroom, but no access to cable channels...what's the point?

Check-in kiosks seem pretty convenient right? They are if you go before peak hours. Twice we got stuck waiting behind people who just looked lost and confused trying to figure out the machines. There's a bunch of kiosks but no organization, so there's just masses of people and luggage crowding around, with the occasional front desk help darting through and pushing buttons for them.

Room is standard, but who cares about how pretty the room is if you're only there to take showers and sleep. View is unbeatable, though. Ours looking straight to Caesar's Palace and Bellagio's musical fountain from the corner of the window. We just had to turn off all the lights in the room, open the curtains all the way, sit down, and enjoy the fireworks display.

Monorail station is located behind this hotel, for those of you who choose to ride it. But most good places are within walking distance from this hotel, so even if you don't feel walking, maybe riding a bus saves more money than monorail.

Didn't go to their buffet (half of my family members are vegetarians), didn't try their swimming pool, but it looked pretty good when I passed by. Didn't play in their casino either (I heard they rip you off there, though). Do your check out from the TV in your room cuz sometimes the lines downstairs can get really crowded.

And unless you really need to, don't use the internet. Heck, $14 per day is not worth it. I used my hotspot-capable phone for internet.

Hotel isn't that big and crowded, which is a plus for me considering the sea of humans I had to go through in TI or Bellagio. Stay here and play somewhere else. That way you save money. :)

PS: I had to take 2 stars off cuz maid knocked on our door at 9 a.m. in the morning for 2 days straight (to clean the room). I couldn't find the ""do not disturb"" sign either. Maybe they don't provide one, but I don't know. It's kinda rude to knock on guest's door to clean their room. I've never experienced that in other hotels.

His name was on the card as well so it was really confusing as to why it was unacceptable.  It's not like the names were completely different and he presented his driver's license to prove it was in fact his card.  After all the confusion settled, she told us that he had to have his mom fax over to the hotel stating that he had permission to use the card.  It would have been okay if she had said this politely from the start, but the entire time she was searching for our reservation on the computer, she was rolling her eyes at us!

I'm boosting it up to three stars because for dinner we went to their steak house.

The service was also surprisingly 'on it' for our 20+ party.

For the price we paid for, it was worth staying as it was centrally located along the strip of Vegas. The only cons is Parking is a torture, with limited lots on the top few levels.

~ Parking for hotel guest is only limited to only the top few levels. So be prepared to drive pass many empty lots but it's all reserved for car rental\/other hotel's guest. It took us about 20 mins to find a lot most of the time.",10,1,4

Kind of a bummer but I made friends in line and was offered a beer by a stranger  who clearly came more prepared than I did. Overall, the hotel was clean, the staff was friendly and the stay was enjoyable. Beds are surprisingly comfy, too.",0,0,1

Damon Rosa was amazing, he shined at the check in counter. His customer service is phenomenal and I really wanted to recognize him. He fixed the issue of my keys not working right after I checked in (which is ridiculous after my 1st encounter at the check-in desk), and he changed my room to something a little more suitable and satisfying. As a manager myself, I feel it's important to recognize your employees who are doing something right. Especially those with such great customer service skills and amazing hospitality. 

Now moving on to the issues at hand during my stay. When I checked in, Benjamin helped me. He stated my room was only reserved for 2 guests. I told him we had three guests and the reservationist must have got confused. He said well unfortunately we cannot do anything about that I have to charge you an extra fee each night. 

My stay was from Thursday the June 19th through Sunday the 22nd and I was with a convention. Our special booking rate included up to three guests in each  reservation. 

I explained to Benjamin I was unsatisfied with the fee, not because of the dollar amount, but because of the fact that I had told the reservationists, and I was under the impression that I had three people in my room at booking. I asked  if I could speak to his manager, and he went over to speak to another gentleman, they did not give me his name and just explained that he was new from New Orleans. Benjamin said that they can pull the conversation of the booking to see if I specifically stated I wanted three people in my room.  He also suggested I wait an hour or two while they pull the conversation before a check-in which I told him that's preposterous, why should should I have to wait after I've already been waiting in what was a long check in line?

So we agreed I would only be charged for two people as that was my understanding of the total cost of the initial booking, and that Benjamin or whichever manager can contact me and let me know what was said during the initial booking conversation. At this point Mr. Murphy you came over and handed me your card. 

I was never contacted and at check out I saw that I was charged $30 a day for an additional pool guest, all three days of my stay. I checked out with one of the representatives with the iPad who said my bill would be emailed to me. By time I received my email, I had left Las Vegas. 

When I saw the charges I contacted the hotel and they told me to contact the billing department. Unfortunately on Sunday the billing department is closed. So I called the billing department today, which is Monday the 23rd. I explain the situation to billing representative and she stated that there was not an additional person charge, but it was additional guest at the pool charge. 

She said she could not do nothing about it because that was all done through the pool and handled by the hotel. I explained to her that we only used the pool one day during the our stay and why should I be charged every day of my stay for additional pool guest when we did not utilize those facilities?

I asked to speak to her manager, who she said is not available, and then I asked for a corporate email address, which she said they do not offer. She transferred me to her manager's voicemail. I left a message with him and have not heard back. 

She also explained that unfortunately sometimes people are  transferred back and forth between the hotel and the billing department, because neither can solve the situation it seems. 

I feel that I have been wrongfully charged by the flamingo Hotel and the Caesars entertainment group for a fee that I did not agree to. I would like to ask that I have the $30 pool fee removed from my bill for each of the days of my stay. The whole experience I had at the hotel was horrible. From check in, to being put in a dark dingy room with a horrible view and of poor quality, To my room keys not working to access that horrible room, to the elevators not working properly and the facilities of the casino and hotel not up to par with the standards of Vegas. 

All in all, if you don't have one of the nicest hotels on the strip, at the very least, you can do is provide great customer service to your guests.  In my experience there was very poor customer service, although there were a few individuals that did provide great service (Damon Rosa at front desk, and the bellhop that helped our luggage to the room were amazing), but overall the experience was not a pleasant one.",2,0,0

We took advantage of their gym and spa.  It was the best $20 we spent.  While working out, a lady walks around carrying cold towel and bottle waters and asked if we would like any.

The Flamingo is perfectly summed up by the phrase ""you get you pay for"".  People ... if you want a high end Vegas casino experience the Flamingo is NOT your place.  However, those places cost double or triple of the Flamingo!  Plan and spend accordingly.  I have been to Vegas probably 25 or 30 times.  I have been in a ton of hotels.  I have stayed at some of the highest end places to dives on Freemont Street.  The Flamingo is certainly one of the more affordable hotels and casinos on the strip.  I would rather stay at the Bellagio, Wynn or Encore - but I liked my bill for the Flamingo.  I like the location of the hotel a lot.  I have stayed here for business 4 years in a row.  The Flamingo is right on the monorail track and has its own stop.  I am always here to attend a trade show at the LVCC so this is super convenient for me.  The rooms are fine and definitely can be called kitschy cool.  I have had better and I have had WAY worse in Vegas.  You get what you pay for in LV (like everywhere) and I was fine again with the value.  If you want to situate yourself on the mid strip (and on the monorail!) this is a great location.  Also, since the Linc has opened up with the street mall on the walk to it I like the food & drink options immediately outside the hotel a whole lot more.  Caesars is right across the street too.  I was in here at like 100 + a night with all the resort fees and taxes.  AGAIN, if you want a high end experience don't stay here, it's that simple - but plan to budget 250-350 a night instead.",5,1,1

I'm a Las Vegas local and was celebrating my 22nd birthday with a staycation.  I searched for a room that would fit my birthday party needs and wanted a cute room that I could walk to from serendipity and the Linq.  Let's face it - the Flamingo is one of the oldest hotels in Vegas.  But, I had recently heard that they remodeled some rooms.  I reserved a King GO room with a Strip View about a week in advance, the money was already taken from my account, and I became a Total Rewards member.

Upon check in (exactly 4pm), I was told that the GO rooms were now all booked - though it was reserved and I had checked the moment it opened.  The woman GRACIOUSLY told me that I have been ""upgraded"" to a suite.  I assured her all I wanted was the pink bathroom.  But, once again I was told that they were completely booked.

Whatever, I guess we'll take the suite then.  We headed up the elevator and I was positively offended when I walked in to this ""upgrade"".  This room was not a Vegas room.  I felt like I went to some small town and paid maybe $120 for it.  Maybe the elevator was a time machine back to the 1970's.  The furniture was dusty and the carpet had stains.  It didn't have a strip view.. I wouldn't sit on anything in there - and I swear I'm not a bitch.. I love camping, and this was dirtier than camping.

My husband decided to call them and ask if we could get something a little closer to what we reserved, or at least closer to what we paid for.  They were gracious enough to give us keys to a different suite with a strip view.  Thankfully, the furniture was clean.  We decided that it was good enough and to make the best of it.

Here's the best part : When they switched our room, I'm guessing no one switched our names in the computer.  Another couple was given keys to our room and waltzed right in while I was sleeping and my husband was in the shower.  AWESOME.  No one called to apologize nor ask if the room was better than the first.  I doubt this is how it goes every time, but unfortunately, that's how it went this time.

Happy Birthday.

Long story short supervisor came but nothing changed same rudeness form him as well. His parents were scared they were first time in Vegas and got the worst experience.

On top of that, they wanted to charge us like $10.00 per-person-per-day  to use their ratty gym and $40.00 a night to use a roll-out bed - seriously nickel and diming the shit out of us.

Having been to Las Vegas several times and staying at a variety of hotels, our stay there was definitely 3 plus stars, but can't make it 4. While they have renovated the rooms, the bathrooms still date back more than a decade.

The service was great and the casino is ideally located around the intersection of Flamingo road. When we first arrived the construction all around was a real drag and complicated our access to the hotel, but over our stay we made it work. My main reason for choosing Flamingo was the price due to it being a last minute trip and a busy March Madness weekend in Vegas. 

Overall, I would stay there again if the price is right, but there are better properties in the area for a marginally higher rate.",2,0,1

The room was dated and looked cheesy and I didn't even want to touch the furry blanket on the bed - so disgusting!

Not kid-friendly. We specifically called the hotel to confirm that the pools were open, since this was the reason we wanted to stay here. Turns out that the water slides were not open and our children had a small, cold, 4 ft deep pool to swim in. We were all disappointed. My kids wanted to end the vacation and go home!

I then asked for wheelchair service as my sister leg is broken. She told me that I'd have to rent one for 24 hrs.

I booked this hotel for a room on Jan 2 2015. I booked the hotel due to everybody in my group staying at the hotel and since I'm part of Total Rewards I would love the points as well. Arrive to the hotel around 9 and informed that they are overbooked and don't have room for me and they would have to move me to the Linq. No discount No comps No Nothing offered for the inconvenience. Just directions to walk across the street to stay at a hotel that I didn't want to.  Going to vegas alot (as you can see from my past reviews) I've always stayed at total reward hotels. That very well could change,0,0,0

I am a regular to Vegas, in fact I call it my second home as I seem to be here at least 5 times each year if not more.
I have stayed at the Flamingo twice before and have a wonderful experience with the room and because the location is GREAT was looking forward to another great stay.
I can't say that this time.
The room this time was horrible. The carpet was beyond stained and gross. The light switches were cracked and broken off. The toilet was broken and we had to call maintence b\/c the hotel staff said they would not move us until they tried to correct the problem. The shower was lacking pressure and needed a clean shower curtain.
I will admit the view of the pool from our room was very nice. Again, you can't beat the location of this hotel on the strip and the casino itself is nice and clean.
I will COMPLIMENT the pool though. The pool deserves 4 stars. It is clean, huge and inviting. The drinks are priced high, but that is to be expected. The music is good and I love that there are separate pools for 18+ and kids (thank goodness). I will advise to get here early though, as the pool fills up quick and chairs get scarce.
I might try here again since the other two times were wonderful, but not in the near future as the Flamingo needs to re-earn my trust.",0,0,0

The property is ideally located for business travel, especially if you are attending a show at Las Vegas Convention Center or the Sands.  If you want to use the Monorail, I also highly recommend staying at the Flamingo.

The best parts of the property are the pool and public grounds, they are simply beautiful.  I also felt the staff was friendly and attentive, though the check in process was very long and there seemed to be lines everywhere.  Gambling at the casino was average, plenty of $5 and $10 tables, a wide variety of slots.  

One other big reason to consider this property is its proximity to the big casinos (Mirage, Bellagio, Aria, Caesar's, Paris, Venetian).  You can easily walk to these facilities, yet the price is literally 1\/2 as much as Caesar's or some of the other ones.

There are some compromises when you stay here...  The rooms are old and many of them are dirty.  My bed was extremely comfortable, and clean, but the bathroom had old tile, worn out fixtures and some dirty \/ musty tile.  Considering I was in my room for about 5-hours a night (just to sleep), it was perfect for the rate I paid.  Another compromise is the amount of walking you may end up doing.  The elevators are widely spaced, so I had a good 1\/4 mile walk from my room to the buffet \/ food areas.

My final analysis is that this place is perfect for those on a budget that plan to be out and about most of the time.  If you want rooms with tons of amenities and beautiful appointments, this is probably not for you.",6,0,0

Also no blanket either. We went to front desk and manager Peter, stated that he would change the room that heater is working so we would not have problem. We got new room, still cold but we put heater on and left room for 1 .5 hours. When we came back, room was super cold.

All I'm going to say is that these older hotel casinos need to step up their game, but then again, I can see why they don't have to as someone needs to accommodate a lower price point compared to the Bellagio, Aria, Encore and the likes.

When we checked in, the line was super long but I noticed that there was a self-service check in kiosk.  I thought, ""Cool, gotta try it out.""  I literally checked myself into a room within a matter of five minutes and it was was so easy, I love technology!  The bro-in-law checked in earlier that morning and sent pics of his ""Go-Room"" which looked pretty snazzy!  I didn't opt for a Go-Room and I kind of regretted it but then again, I had more money for shopping!

There were three different elevator banks to get to your specific room.  You need to know which exact elevator you need to get on otherwise it'll be a long walk.  When we get to the room, it was totally basic, no frills and borderline dirty, i.e. gum on the carpet.  But we made the best of it and after awhile, didn't pay much attention.  The room definitely is in dire need of renovated with new furnishings, along with the old school tube TV that hums when it turns on.  The bed surprisingly was fairly comfy though.  The bathroom was quite dull, but spacious, then again, we were in an accessible room.  The shower was a tub but it had rails and a hand held shower head which couldn't stay put, so I had to hold it or literally stand near the wall to be under the stream.  Not to mention, the tub area had no lighting and it didn't help that the shower curtain was made of thick, industrial strength plastic which just let a mild glow of light through.

I honestly don't like eating on the Strip as there is so much foodie goings on beyond the Strip so, I can't comment on any of the restos.  I do remember eating at their cafe a few years ago and it was just standard diner type of food and service.

The gaming was decent and they had all the newer slots with LED screens and whatnot.  I guess they'd rather invest in new slot machines than put an LED TV in the rooms, which I guess makes better business sense.

Their parking garage can be tough to maneuver and easily gets full, same goes with their Valet, unless you happen to be a Diamond or Seven Stars player.

Overall, the Flamingo's location is so ideal as it's located in the heart of the Strip.  If you want to be in the middle of all the action and simply just want a bed to lay your head on in the wee hours of the morning, go for it!  However, I personally wouldn't stay here again, unless it was in a Go Room.",3,2,2

We got a great rate for room and flight through Vegas.com $236 for a flight and hotel for 2 nights, 3 days. We weren't expecting much for the room, because who stays in there room in Vegas anyways?

POOL: Why we chose the Flamingo, THE POOL! The GO pool is totally worth the stay. There is one major big pool with a waterfall and there is a small pool towards the entrance. The upstairs area pool is for kids and families. There are palm trees in the water and there is a small lagoon area. Dancers come out at around 11 - 12:00 PM noon to dance while trendy tunes are blasting around. They have happy hour specials from 8 to 12 PM. $20 bucket of beer (5) and $5 bloody marys and Coors Light cans. There is a grotto, several drink stands and servers that walk around to take orders of food and drinks. We ordered a chicken quesadilla and chicken tenders and were super happy with the taste and portions. Can't complain here. You are not supposed to bring in food or drink. They will allow coffee and water. Yes, things are a bit expensive in regards to drinking at the pool. Their collective flamingo cup with slushy alcoholic beverage runs about $22. Get there at 8:00 AM when the pool opens, so you can get a good seat, otherwise you won't find one and you will have to lay your towel out by the pool and sit. Cabanas get booked fast. Daybeds are $249. Not sure how much lounge chairs are. Think you can book ahead on the cabanas, possibly online. NEED YOUR ID and ROOM KEY TO get into the pool, so plan ahead! Towels as you walk in. 

ROOM: We arrived around 11:00 PM. We asked for an early check in. It would have been $30, which isn't a big deal. But the lady asked us if we wanted an upgrade for $20 and she would wave the early check in rate. SOLD. Our room overlooked Caesar's Palace. The beds had white sheets and covers with a pinkish furry thing at the end of our bed. There were two Flamingo property photographs that were trendy on the walls. The couch was grey with pink trimming and our view was great. We were pleased with what we had. Yes, the bathroom looks a bit dated, but everything was functional and clean. Again, you shouldn't be in your room, so we were happy with the location on the strip and our view. The Flamingo is a great location on the strip. You can easily get to Caesar's and its about a 10-15 min walk to Bellagio and the Paris. About a 20 min walk to Cosmopolitan and Aria. Taxi cab rides to Cosmpolitan or Aria were about $10. Split the costs with your friends and you are saving a lot more money. Amenities like coffee, shampoo\/conditioner in one, soap. TV was fine and the AC worked very well. 

TIP: If you have a total rewards card, you go into check in a lot quicker. We bypassed 100 guests by going into the Total Rewards line for check in. CHA CHING! If you don't have one, go over to the Total Rewards desk, get your Total rewards card and then go check in. You'll save time. Also, your Total Rewards card will get you discounts here and there on Harrah's properties (Harrahs, Flamingo, the Quad, Caesar's, Ballys etc) 

Paradise Buffet: We were planning on going off the strip for lunch, but we were at the Flamingo and saw a buffet. We paid $30 but added on a $9.99 all you can drink beer, wine, bloody marys, mimosas deal. The buffet was typical with prime rib, shrimp, chicken, pasta, salad, mac and cheese and lots of desserts. I drank my $9.99 mimosas and beers and had a great buzz going on! So, if you sit there for awhile and drink, you'll get your moneys worth, especially since all the casinos charge so much for drinks. Of course you could sit at a machine or gamble and stock up, but that could get expensive. So remember that many of the Harrah's properties have the $9.99 all you can drink option for their buffets, expect for Caesar's Bacchanal buffet.

Casino Payoffs: Pretty good. I had luck here. Played Star Wars, played Sex and the City and the Hangover and won money, so I'm a happy camper.

There are Flamingos as the pool, real live ones. Saw a lot of people eating at a pizza bar located by the Paradise buffet. Looked and smelled delicious. A reasonable price to stay at a central location. They have renovated areas and rooms, so give it a try. Again, dont compare it to Bellagio, Encore, Wynn or the new places. If you want to save some money, stay here.",2,1,1

The ceiling in the shower was cracked a bit & paint was chipping off, and the pillows were lumpy. Oh, and the pool area was SWARMING with drunk co-eds and even more drunk middle-aged folk. But that's to be expected, especially for the weekend we were there (Labor Day weekend). Overall, though, this place was a good place to stay. There's a great little crepe place in the downstairs, as well as a nice chocolate shop. Plus, the outdoor patio area is pretty, and the real flamingos there are pretty neat.  It's also a less expensive option on the strip, so if you're looking for a place to stay on the cheap, check it out.

If it had been up to me I would have stayed somewhere like New York or Paris, but this was my husband's favorite hotel so I obliged him. We went for an Oregon State football game, and had told the hotel that we really needed to get into our room early in order to get ready to go to the game. Of  course they have their normal checkin times, but had said they would do their best. 

So, when we arrived, we waited in the long check in line, and our room wasn't ready. I was pretty frustrated, then the manager came over and apologized, and upgraded our room at no cost. We payed an average rate for a normal room, and they bumped us up to a bigger room with a breathtaking view of the strip (I think 14th floor). We were sooo stoked! 

I would give them 4.5 stars, just because of the frustration of the long line and room not being ready but I can only give 4 or 5. So here's 5 stars Flamingo, thank you for giving us a great experience at your hotel- we would LOVE to get that room again!",1,1,2

Cons :
The timeshare people are hilarious, I wouldn't talk to one lady and she yelled at me -lol
These have to be the most annoying people in Las Vegas. I think every hotel has these losers trying to sell you a steal of a deal 20k timeshare. Just walk away from them, if you bite of one of their free meals or tickets, be prepared to spend half your day at their offices.

Plus: The Margaritaville section is pretty cool plus their bars are great! They have decent drink prices too. We love their restaurant as well.

Next time I would pay a bit more and stay at the Bellagio or the Venetian - those are a class act.

And never ever eat at Carlos & Charlies (which is in the hotel).",1,0,0

With that said, The Flamingo is the best deal if you want to stay right in the middle of the Strip. The regular rooms are pretty basic, but the suites are very nice. Honestly though, it is Vegas. How much time are you going to be spending in your room especially since staying at the Flamingo means you are close to everything and the monorail is connected to your hotel?

My husband and I stayed here during our honeymoon and we were able to check in on our phones before we arrived and avoided a ridiculous check in line. We were upgraded to a suite for our stay and it was incredible. 

The room was pink, white, and styled after a glamorous 60's apartment. Everything was perfectly clean, the shower and tub were jetted and there was a tv embedded into the bathroom mirror. Drapes were automatic which was really neat. The self parking was a little difficult to find, but thankfully the route from the parking garage took us through the shops to get to the hotel lobby instead of the smokey casino. The location was perfect, we could walk to anything or get a taxi for the things that were father away. 

There were only a few things that were disappointing during our stay. Trying to get an elevator was like trying to get a tv on black friday. It was quite a competition, and once you were on, they moved so quickly it almost made you nauseous. In our room, the speakers in the living room weren't working and the self check out option on the TV wasn't working either.  

Overall though, our experience was great, and I would recommend and return to the Flamingo.",4,0,5

The pool was lots of fun! We didn't have a room key and figured we might not be let in, but we found out all was ok with our ID's as we entered the ""Go Pool"" which is the 21+ pool.  We made it in around 930 and we were probably the last two people to get chairs. The pool area is huge and has a lot of room to pick from IF you get there early enough. The drinks were not too expensive.. we had some Vegas Vice drinks I think that was the name and strawberry mojitos. We were served by James both days we were there who was very nice and attentive! 
I had done the Web ""check in "" and was supposed to receive a txt when our room would be ready. At about 230 we were done w the pool and decided to check if there was a room available since i had not received any notification . We did get a room and check in was quick at the front desk.  Got a room on the 4th floor..
Should have gotten the upgrade lol.  As soon as we walked in noticed it was small, but definitely not bad for the price.  There was a king size bed, desk and chair, dresser, TV and a non working control.  There was also a beat up mini fridge  next to the dresser.  The restroom is very small but enough for what you need.  As we started to put our things away we get a knock. I opened the door and there's a lady telling me she's here to pick up the fridge??? We asked what do you mean we just checked in? She said call the front desk if you want one. Didn't even make eye contact with us. So we called the front and they let us know it would be $15\/DAY for the fridge. We skipped the fridge and got a disposable cooler at Walgreens. Worked just the same.  Didnt receive room service during our stay.  Everything is super close by and everyone seemed friendly. I even had left some items at the pool and was let in to look as the pool closed down.   Thank you Phillip and the rest of the crew for being so nice! Would def recommend this hotel for anyone even for families with kids.",2,0,0

Due to construction, $7 shuttle drop-off from the airport is a good 1\/4 mile walk to hotel entrance.  Not great for dragging luggage on a hot day.  Next was a very long wait in the Rewards Check in line, which was MUCH shorter than the non Rewards line.  Lost reservations and no replacement room available at that price didn't help, but for only $40 more, we were able to get a room for the night.  In our room, we were able to call and make a new reservation with no mention of lost reservation for the rest of the week at original price, no problem.  

I only saw one map in the whole building, a touchscreen map near the check in area.  It was only working one time during the week we were there.  You get a tiny map of the 1st floor as you check in, but it's outdated, and the writing too small to read without a magnifying glass.  No you are here fire escape map on the hotel room doors or in any binders like you see in most hotels. 

No fridge, microwave, coffee maker (all extra $$).  WiFi is free for one device with the $13 mandatory daily resort charge.  We ended up cheating and turning one of our computers into a secure hot spot for the rest of our gadgets.  Trip to Wal-Mart and the purchase of a cheapy ice-chest replaced the $13 a day refrigerator charge.  It also held more than the fridge they offered. The 12 pack of soda purchased for $3.50 at Wal-Mart replaced the $4 a bottle of Pepsi charge downstairs.  

Mold in the bathroom pretty bad.  If you are 6' 6"", you will have to bend to even stand in the tub due to the low ceiling clearance.  At 6'2"", I still ended up getting shampoo on the ceiling.  Bathroom sink very low..  Ceiling in hotel hallways very low also, and waves and tears in hallway carpet easy to trip over. Elevators pretty fast, which was nice.

Supposed clogged drain somewhere that was going to flood the hotel by morning woke us up at 3 am when maintenance started fishing the pipe somewhere in the building.  It took them 1\/2 hour to resolve that issue, and only another hour for me to get back to sleep. Two more nights sleep were interrupted when the extremely loud announcement from our room's wall speaker notified us a few times that the cause of the alarm (that we didn't even hear) has been determined and there is no cause for alarm. I can only assume that it was a building wide announcement for something that happened in the casino.  On the 14th floor in the Habitat wing, noise from the adult only pool area sounds like loud haunted wailing.  

Had a full face waxing done in the spa.  Spa was totally empty at 10 in the morning.  Just me and two employees.  Once back in their waxing area, I was told that I had to pay an extra $20 to have my cheek area also waxed.  The ended up missing the side burn area all together, which ended up looking very funny once I noticed.  

All in all, this hotel SUCKS!  Over charging and then nickle and diming everywhere you look.  Customer service also sucks, though our housekeeper was nice and knew what room we were from.  If we ever come back to Las Vegas (which is very doubtful), we won't be staying here.",0,0,0

I've stayed at flamingo several times in the past as I am platinum total rewards member and often get deals. Last time I said I wouldn't go back but decided to try since I actually like the casino (the dealers are friendly and generally have a great vibe-Still believe that very happy with Blackjack experience).  My problems were with the hotel reception (supposedly vip status remember) and their willingness to help. Two stars are all to even out great casino experience with awful hotel experience. 

1. Service is everything. I can deal with anything else if treated with respect, courtesy and feel they are trying to help. Three different people at guest services were unhelpful. 2 in special vip check in one at the desk. We were in vegas for 42 hours total and spent 5 hours fighting with flamingo...stupid. 

Check in vip room went well the first day. Next day got call that credit card wasn't working. Called cc company indeed it was shut off for fraudulent activity (not our fault). We called desk and then went back to vip room explained issue gave new credit card. They turned our keys back on. Ok all is well (we thought!) left for the day for other TR properties. Got over to Paris wanted to charge lunch to our room said we aren't authorized (2 hours after giving new credit card) embarrassing and annoying but ok. We want to charge to room as it's easier and we can use accrued TR points to pay at end do they screwed us. Called flamingo because we didn't want to walk all the way back, were waiting to see live band at Paris. after being on hold 30 minutes told they can't help great thanks. Spent night at Paris once again can't charge dinner or drinks to room so irritated. Walk back to flamingo play blackjack until dead tired and we have early flight Sunday so head up to bed. 20 minutes for elevator get to room both husband and my room key doesn't work. They shut it off again. Storm down to desk really mad and tired now. Again here less than two days don't need to waste time dealing with crap. Desk person no help at all no explanation no apologies for cutting off our charging privileges or room key. Hey thanks! Great customer service smh. Next day went to vip room when they opened explained everything. Got no apology, explanation, or any kind of compensation for trouble. Sarcastically told to talk casino host 
Knowing we had to leave for airport. Thanks again. Left to never return. So much for being loyal TR guests of 20 years. No different than anyone else. Loyalty doesn't matter. 


2. Booked non smoking room, smelled of smoke and had to place towels under doors to keep smoke out of our room all night. Reported to front desk with no apology or help. Seemed to not care. I cared it kept me up all night coughing, I understand that smoking occurs in casino and I choose tables wisely next door with no one smoking but in my room I expect clean air. 

3. Room tired dated scarce offerings. No coffee, refrigerator, lame toiletries, linoleum floor, worn out bathroom but good enough I guess to sleep especially if you're ten kids piled up as this hotel attracts. Go rooms much much better than the one we got don't even know what it's called but king standard I guess in heritage tower. These rooms are very basic and hallways and elevators old and nasty. View of roller not bad but the rest lame.

The Flamingo is the second oldest hotel on the strip. It is no Bellagio and it is no Wynn, but it is nicer than most hotels I usually stay at around the country. Also, this hotel is smack-dab in the middle of the strip and perfect for checking out the surrounding hotels and sites.

I like it because it has that 1950s look to it. It has this cheesy pink decor, which I liked because it's vegas! At night, it is the essence of old school Vegas and I loved looking at it. Donny and Marie are the big names performing there right now, which fits in perfectly with the hotel. 

The room was decent, the view we had overlooked the tropical pools below and it was nice. Everyone who helped us was polite.

The great thing is that there are plenty of shops downstairs, a casino, a food court, and there is a pizza center which makes a really good pizza for late night snacking at only $12. Plus you should get the fries. For only $5, you get a mountain. And the gelato is good too. While you're there, try the burger place next door. I haven never seen such large burgers in my life.

We thought since Flamingo claimed to have renovated rooms it would be fun to stay there. HUGE mistake. We had a Go Deluxe room for $40, not worth it. The room was large size and seemed to be renovated (paint, wallpaper, and new mattress). No carpet, that's great, but seriously vinyl flooring? The furniture was lacking, one ""desk"" (which was really just a tallish small table) that was scarred\/gouged, 1 chair and a cheap chaise lounge that the bottom covering was coming off of, and a dresser. The bathroom has definitely never been renovated, the bathroom sink had come loose from the counter, there was nothing to keep you from slipping in the shower, and water pressure was quite low. The walls are incredibly thin, I could hear the guy in the bathroom next door peeing. The carpet in the hallway was bunched, I tripped several times (and I was quite sober). I think the elevators are original, they are noisy and a little scary. We made the mistake of driving out to Ethel's Chocolates to see the Xmas display. That was wonderful, however, when we came back there was NO parking in the garage at all. After driving through 3x we finally decided to valet park, whoa, valet parking full. No self parking, no valet parking, now what. We finally found an overflow parking lot way behind the hotel. The other issue is the timeshare sellers that lurk near the elevators. When I tell someone no I'm not interested, then leave me alone, don't keep pushing your product on me, I'm liable to let the Irish Bitch loose on you. There were a few goods during our stay - room size, no carpet in room, floor to ceiling windows, all staff encounters positive. Everyone was super friendly, when the ""boys"" next door decided to party hearty and we called the front desk, security responded promptly and handled the issue. We ate lunch at Johnny Rocket's one day and that was great. We sat at the counter, Debbie served us. She was so upbeat and friendly and made me the best milkshake I've ever had (Orange Creamsicle), the staff did a dance that was fun to watch. Also Sin City was fun and had a good selection of drinks.

Il y a 2 grandes piscines (mais pas eut le temps de tester) et attention car elles ferment tôt. Quand j'y étais c'était 18h (le soleil se couchait à 18h30), ça veut dire qu'à 17h30 on ne peut plus y aller. Dommage parce qu'avec la chaleur, j'aurais bien fait un petit saut pour me rafraîchir.

Il y a aussi des enclos ouvert avec des flamants roses (évidemment), plein d'espèces de canards différents, des pélicans etc...

Vous passerez certainement un bon séjour ici (à moins de perdre tout vos sous) mais ne vous attendez pas a du grand luxe",2,1,0

However, upon arrival I was surprised to see a variety of guests of different ages! The decor of the hotel itself is very nice. Lots of bright colors and fresh white tiles. The check-in line took a little bit of time but there were only 5 reps attending guests so I guess there wasn't much to complain about. 

Checking in was a breeze! My rep was Ronnell and he was a young, cheerful rep who was very customer-friendly. We had a lovely chat about the types of events that were taking place during our stay and he recommended a few ideas for my party. Ronnell even went so far as to upgrade our room--now that's what I call customer service! The room we stayed in was the Go Room, 1-king bed with a view of the high roller. We had an amazing audio system with a subwoofer and lots of space to host our own parties before stepping out at night! 

This hotel loses one star for their terrible room service. During our stay, our sliding bathroom door fell off its hinge and we immediately called guest services to go ahead and have a technician fix it. We called several times during the day and expected it to be fixed at some point but we didn't get it fixed until the next day... Talk about an awkward situation for everyone who came over! My only other complaint is that we had gotten noise complaints from having our music play too loud and we were treated very rudely by security. What's the point in offering a subwoofer stereo system if we are just going to get in trouble for blasting the music?

Overall it was a very good experience and I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who's looking for an affordable hotel located conveniently at the center of the LV strip.",0,0,1

Vegan wise - the restaurants all have things you can work on to veganize but its annoying and you really have to invent your own menu item - the pros being that the kitchen staff was *super* accommodating and had no problems piecing things together for me.  also there was soy milk available for coffee which is a *huge* pro when you're hungover and looking for an AM coffee.",0,0,0

We thought this is a good place to stay since it's in the middle of the strip.  Not a very family friendly place even though the lagoon type pool online may be inviting.  Only a small section of the pool, where the lame slides were, are for families.  The lagoon area was blocked off for 21 and older.  The kids were bored out of their mind.  I got a nice golden tan out of it, though.

We asked for non-smoking rooms and it reeked of smoke and fragrance spray to mask it...gagged me.  We asked for another room and it was a little better.  We paid $179 a night per room in advance thinking that it will reserve 3 rooms, all with 2 doubles.  We still got one with a king.  My friend said we were jipped for paying that much per room.  Live and learn.  

The remodel was nothing exciting.  Slapped on some paint, change the bedsheets, and add a flat panel tv...voila!   Our room had the laminated floor and the rest had the dirty and stained carpets...eww.  The bathrooms were not too bad.

With hordes of people, expect to line up for everything...yes, everything!  The buffet was not that great (review coming up).

It was a good deal, two nights coming out to about $250 for 2 queen beds. My two friends had stayed at Flamingo hotel before and recommended it because it was a good deal for how much you pay. I was skeptical at first, because Flamingo has been around for a while (compared to the other hotels on the strip), but I decided to give it a try, and with two couples, $250 was a steal! 

While reading the website, it stated that the room was newly remodeled. My friend was telling me how their bathrooms were really nice and had a tv inside. When we arrived, all we saw that was remodeled was the floor. The beds and bathroom felt like I was staying at a motel! It turns out she was talking about the Go Deluxe! We were coming from LA after work, so we were too tired to ask the front desk if we could switch rooms and we decided to stay at the Fab Deluxe Double Queen. 

Their bed was mediocre. Their blanket was hardly a blanket. It was a flat sheet with a  cheaper feeling fleece blanket. I think the blankets also made me a little itchy =[ 

The bathroom was really small! The last time I had a bathroom that small was when I went snowboarding in Mammoth and we stayed at a motel! The shower was very strong and was hurting my back =[

For what we paid, it definitely was what we got. I probably would not come back to this particular room. I would definitely book the Go Deluxe next time to see the upgrades. In terms of a Vegas room, it is definitely what I would anticipate if I was heading to Vegas. So many other hotels with great quality but you definitely would have to pay more for the rooms.

My son had a GO room which he described as sleeping in Victoria's Secret's box. Pink, plastic, tacky, but it did have a great view of the Strip.

The bathroom was tiny and you could not get out of the shower if the bathroom door was open or sit on the toilet with the bathroom door open. The shower was very narrow and the shower curtain constantly touched you while in the shower due to the narrowness. The sink leaked and the grout was molding.. Definitely needed some serious updating.
The pillows were very hard and old.

The walls were very thin and could hear every thing and one go by, including the people staying next to us. We used the 'spa elevators' to access our rooms and there was ALWAYS a huge line to get to them. Why?
The carpet in the hallways were oversized and rippling so it was impossible to roll our luggage on. Definite accident waiting to happen.

The only reason we stay at the flamingo is for the pool and the over all location. We do not eat anywhere downstairs (except the new pizza place that replaced the $2 burger place) or gamble anywhere in the casino.
We will only stay at the flamingo again if it is in the go deluxe.

As for the casino area, it has quite an attractive look for an older building on the strip.  It didn't look worn down like most of the old Vegas casinos.  I was surprised.

The Casino itself was a bit dated and didn't seem to have a lot of floor space. I guess my only complaint would be the lack of food in the casino.

I was thinking WOW!! They told me to come back a little closer to check-in time and that I would not have to wait in tge Check-in line , I could just pick up my key. I tipped the guy for a bag check and once your room is ready they will bring it up for you. I mean thats a whole let better than walking the strip or casino with all your lugagge. The casino area is pretty nice and big. The places to eat are ok just stay clear away from Carlos and Charlies resturant , they are horrible. (You can read my review on that). The one thing that did disappoint me was the fact that when I did come back around six to check-in , my room was still not ready. So I sort of caused a small scene.

Maybe different floors have different issues but I was on the 10th floor and the carpets were just ok. Reading other reviews before going made me nervous as heck. I thought I was going to see chalk outlining dead bodies and smell urine etc... That was not my experience at all. My room was one that was updated. I got a luxury Fab room. This room was a strip view, nice comfy bed and very spacious. The bathroom is the one thing that could have been updated but it wasnt like a motel 6 bathroom. It was still very clean and everything was working. Water pressure and water temperature was completely fine. All in all the bathroom needed some paint and newer floors. The actual room was just great. No bedbugs... I always check when I stay in hotels. (I always fold down the  fitted sheets at the corners of the mattress to check if I see any black specs). If you dont know... you should always pack dryer sheets with you to put in your actual lugagge and to put in between the sheets and mattress to keep all the bedbugs, bugs and other pest of that kind away. One big reason I landed on this hotel is because they do not charge a resort fee. I really do not understand why alot of other hotels charge these fees but hey its Vegas!!! The buffets are just ok but the best buffet is the one in Ceasars. (Sorry, I do not remember the name).

Cheap gambling on table games

Monorail station makes it super easy and cheap to get around
Beautiful manicured grounds
Exotic birds and sanctuary on grounds 
Terrific pool area - huge and fun

I have stayed in both an older standard room and one of the updated ""GO"" rooms. The standard room recently was ok by me. Clean, neat, hot shower, comfy bed, no problems. The ""GO"" room is a trip - bright white and pink motif, tv screen in bathroom mirror, flat screen with dvd\/cd player and stereo, very cool decor, almost like a porn shoot set.

Check in and check out lines can be long, but I always try to get in early so lines are not too bad, and you can check out on the tv. Also, no need to really wait on lines if you are a Platinum\/Diamond Players Card member as there is a VIP check in room to use.

Restaurants and bars here are just average. Nothing great but nothing too horrible either. On weekends there is a fun bar in front with loud pumping music, gogo dancers and hottie dealers set up. Other then Donnie and Marie there is an X-Burlesque show on site. Not too much other entertainment here. Tables games are ok, and they have the standard slots, but gaming area is on the smaller side. 

Overall, the Flamingo is decent choice if on a tight budget. Good location on the strip, great pool, easy access to monorail, and never seems too crowded. Just don't expect the ""wow"" factor that you get at the Wynn, Bellagio, or Venetian. You get what you pay for - a cheaper hotel\/casino. If you have a larger budget to play with go with another casino as there are great room deals to be had in Vegas nowadays. Still, I have no major complaints about the Flamingo. It is what it is.",6,2,2

There is a food court with a Bonannos pizza, Johnny Rockets, LA subs and salad, and a Pan Asian. We like the Bonanno's the best.

I should have listened to all the other recent reviews. We got the GO room floor 20, it stunk so bad like mold or who knows what, and a bucket sitting in front of the elevator for leaking water from ceiling. We called down to the desk and told them and they moved our room one floor up , with no smell. They charged us 80$ resort fee (they never did that in the past) for wifi etc. Had NO wifi connection the whole time I was there , and needed to check into my flight. Spent another hour at the desk complaining about this. Then the next day we had no air conditioning in our room. Yet more time at the desk trying to resolve another issue. The last thing I want to be doing on my vacation is complaining at the service desk. Oh and don't forget the food court was closed due to the plumbing issues and constructions going on in the casino stunk like sewage from an incident a few weeks ago. They did resolve our issues in a timely manner however , refunded our resort fees, free breakfast etc. Next time Ill be staying at the Hard Rock for the same price.

- great location on the strip.
-  reasonable prices for rooms.
- remodeled\/updated fo rooms were very nice.
-  wedding chappel manager was able to pull off my anniversary gift for my husband in a very short span of time.
- wildlife habitat was pretty interesting.
- margaritaville was pretty happening. 
- no resort fees.

Negative:
-  casino is smaller, even when the margaritaville casino is included.
- very pushy timeshare people located throughout the casino, at every elevator, etc. hard sell and pressure to buy was way too much.
- the rooms lacked sound insulation. the few times we wanted to take a nap at 2am, the room next door had a huge party that sounded like it was right in our room and this carried on for hours for several nights.
- never had a warm shower while there. No matter what time of day or night, the water pressure was low and water never got better than luke warm. 
- they could use a better selection of restaurants. We ate at hamada of japan and margaritaville. Nothing special. went to planet hollywood for better restaurants.
- wi fi is $15 a day for in your room. if you want to use wi fi on their extended property, it is $25 per day.

I had to go back and stand in a line again (just to check in was 45 minutes) and it took 20 minutes to stand in line to get the correct room.

My heart goes out to all you Yelpers who had horriffic experiences, but I must have hit the jackpot because our stay was so wonderful!

I arrived early - 12pm - and check-in didn't start until much later. I got in line with high hopes. The lady up front suggested I register for a Total Rewards card which would allow me to bypass the early check-in fee when they had a room available. I left my bags with the bellhop and made my way into the casino. It reminded me of the casinos back home in MN, kind of old, and wasn't terribly flashy like I had fantasized them to be. However the (free) drinks were strong and there were PLENTY of people around which gave me reassurance this was still a great place to hang out. After an hour of day-drinking and gambling away $10, I decided to try for a room. I got to stand in the TR line (versus the regular line with about 30 people in it). I was helped immediately and went right up to my room. 

Our room - was honestly fantastic. I wonder (reading previous reviews) if all of the rooms are in a state of renovation of some sort, whether it is the bathroom or the beds or whatnot - but ours was pristine. The bathroom was huge! The shower was large as well, the sink was clean and enough counter space for 3 women.

The beds were almost too-comfy and kind of sank in the middle - but I didn't come to Vegas to SLEEP! The stereo system worked well, and the view of Caesar's Palace was perfect. My only complain in the room is that the outside of the windows were pretty dirty, but whatevs.

My checklist for a Vegas hotel is as such:

1) good location - CHECK (very central to all the action)
2) clean room - CHECK (make sure to get at least a GO room)
3) moderately priced - CHECK ($590 for 3 nights and 3 people = ~ $200 each)
4) pool - CHECK (the GO pool had lots of space, clean, good music)

Really the Flamingo has a lot to offer - if you want a Resort-type feel of luxury, I would not recommend. But for a good price and awesome location in the middle of all the action, you can't do better in Vegas.

Parking- They have the smallest parking lot ever. And half of the spots are reserved for Valets and hilton vacation clubs. We couldn't find any parking for 30+ mins, so we gave up and parked in a open lot far far away. I never run into parking situation like this ever in Vegas.

Checking in- They have a check-in deadline for midnight. We called and they said the front desk will be open till 1am. We got there and waited in line for another 45 mins just to check in.   There was only two registration opened. I understood that it is almost 1 am and you're won't expecting this kind of crowd..

My husband dropped me off so I could check in and the reservation specialist wouldn't give me the keys because he said my name was not on the reservation even though I had a confirmation number, my husband's credit card and other qualifying information. It took over an hour to check in and the room was nowhere near as nice as the pictures on their website. What's worst was the ambivalence of the manager Jarrod. He said this is the norm for the hotel and literally offered no recourse. Jamison, a regular employee over heard the manager speak to us and pushed him to offer something in exchange for a very bad experience. Very odd customer service. This was truly a disaster especially after driving 4+hours to get to the hotel. I know Vegas is all about the money, but your reputation goes farther than the dollar bill. I suggest spending your money where it'll be valued and appreciated all the way. 

OH BY THE WAY....They get you on their rooms. Unless you initially request it, you will get one of their old antiquated rooms which are absolutely gross.

Then, the Diamond lounge sucked. 11.11.16 was better than before, but it is never consistent, which I separately reviewed, but it is part of the hotel & casino.  I also waited to post some of my review in hopes that the Flamingo Hotel & Casino would redeem themself cause I'd like to take advantage of my free room offer.  No thanks.

The pool is ok, nothing special w\/ super old plastic lounge chairs.  Horrible smoke ventilation & the bar carry's no nice wine or champagne.  Not one single bar.  The showroom has no cocktail waitresses & the bar is in the far right hidden from everyone.  I've seen three shows there.

I would say four except that the show we were scheduled for was cancelled.  The Flamingo Box Office is absolutely the worst also.  It all depends on who you get, however that too should be consistent.

As I mentioned on 10.13.16, Flamingo couldn't even call us or email that Jeff Civillio Comedy show cancelled for the rest of the year.  They email me over free rooms etc to mainly get my play, but as a courtesy they should email that the show has been cancelled. I moved my schedule around & planned on meeting friends in the Linq as mom & dad were going to attend the show. 

As I waited for the Flamingo box office manager, Sherice, the Jeff Civillio performance behind Jerrin the Diamond\/7Star rep, was being advertised. Also I informed them that the cancelles show brochures were still on display.  Jerrin was kind, but the manager Sherice was of no help at all.  Paul another manager finally informed us that TR would help us better. 

Sherice never informed us of any of this until I asked her for higher management cause I'd never had such unnecessarily, rude & bad service.

Finally, I speak to a real person who should teach Sherice some customer service skills, Antoinette in TR. Now, she is the only person I will speak to at Flamingo. Five stars or 'seven stars' for her. She has what it takes to keep a client. She turned the whole situation around for us. 

Overall, I give the Flamingo one star cause there is only one of her & that is sad. I had the worst service until I met her & have given them a chance to fix it until posting this such as my Diamond lounge check ins.  They also need a remodel.

I hunted around in the Self-Parking lot for about 20 minutes, but couldn't find a single space to park. I decided to try valet...which was also full. I was told that, even though I was a guest at that hotel for 2 days, that I would have to park in a neighboring hotel's parking structure. I schlep my luggage from across the street at Bally's to front desk where I am confronted with an incompetent desk clerk who informs me that I am not to check in until the following day. I let her know that is inaccurate and she stares at the screen, scoffs, then proceeds to say ""oh, right."" An apology would've sufficed. I ask to speak with the Reservations Manager to vent about how unacceptable it is that I had to park two hotels down even though I was a guest at this hotel. He doesn't express condolences or apologize throughout our entire conversation, instead gives me a litany of excuses as to why I had no place to park... including that some of the valet are reserved for Diamond Members. This makes sense but he has to include, in a particularly obnoxious tone, that if you want to be treated like first class, you have to pay first class prices. Gee... if I was paying first class prices, I certainly won't be paying them here! I let him know that I am a California resident and visit Vegas at least 4-5 times a year. This wasn't my first time staying at this hotel but that it was most likely going to be my last. He literally shrugs his shoulders, lifts his hands and eyebrows and turns and walks away. Awesome. As if this weren't enough, to top it off, we get to our room and are confronted with a massive water damage mark above one of the beds (I thought this place was just renovated?!), a make-up smeared towel in the bathroom and fixtures that looked like they were about to crumble. I am generally a very easy-going person, however, when I feel that people who are specifically in the customer service industry are downright rude, you may as well go poke a hornet's nest. If at any point in my entire interaction with the hotel staff had someone genuinely said ""I'm sorry"", I would have saved myself the trouble of writing this entire comment. Needless to say, I will no longer rave about this hotel or suggest it as a place to stay to anyone.",0,0,0

Booked a block of rooms for my sister's wedding (she got married there at the Flamingo). The rooms we were told we were getting for the wedding package (pictures online) were not what we actually received. They were so dirty! All of them! I'm talking pubes in the bathrooms, dust all over the beat up furniture, crusty sheets, etc.

There is no insulation on the door. Actually a good inch and a half of open space between the door and the floor. You have to hear everyone in the hall. And not just the loud drunk people either. Every word anyone speaks. I resorted to shoving towels under the door to reduce the noise level. 

My smoke alarm spontaneously went off at 6:00 am. Called the front desk 3 times and no one came to fix it. After 45 minutes of having to listen to the screaming alarm, a carpenter happened to walk by and called someone to fix it. He said the front desk never called it in. 

The alarm clock in the room next to mine went off at 1am every day on the loudest volume and blasted until 4 am. I called the front desk multiple times 3 nights in a row before someone finally went and turned it off. No one was even checked into that room. Again, the front desk clearly doesn't give a crap. 

The hotel treated my sister and new brother in law very poorly especially considering they spent so much money to get married on their property. (I will say that the people that performed the actual wedding ceremony were very nice).

There are far too many options of hotels when in Vegas. I highly suggest you never waste your time or money at the Flamingo.",2,1,0

The decor was modern with sleek hot pink curtains although the furniture (dressers, desks, nightstand) were all visibly worn. The best thing about this hotel is the location right on the strip with easy access to many of the other big hotels like cesar's palace. The second best thing about this hotel was the 24hr pizza delivery service from the hotel's pizza place. There is nothing better than coming home slightly (or very) intoxicated at 4am & having the convenience of ordering a fresh pizza that will also be delivered straight to your door. One good thing to know is that they don't provide any extra amenities like toothbrushes, razors etc. Those kinds of things are available downstairs in a seriously overpriced convenience store\/gift shop so don't forget any of that from home!",0,0,0

I'm really not that hard to please but I guess I had set my expectations a little too high. It was my first time in Vegas and I was expecting grand hotel entrances, big lobby's, and fancy rooms with updated technology. That isn't exactly what this hotel was. 

When the taxi first dropped us off the main circle entrance to the hotel we got out and didn't know where to go... there was no grand main entrance, we found a glass door with a small staircase inside, no elevators or escalators and asked a man if this is how we get into the lobby... maybe it was under construction but it was just a really weird main entrance to something and we had to lug our backs up all the stairs. We got there at 4:30 and thought it would be fine checking in since our room was to be ready at 4:00. It took over an hour to check in! There was a GIANT line in the lobby to check in. The line was so much longer than the line for TSA at the airport... When we got to our room it was completely dark. There was also an hour long line to check out. Just for those reasons I'm not sure I would want to stay at this hotel again... I would rather pay a little more money and not have to spend two hours in line. 
But I think you can actually skip the long line if you check in online and check out online? I just never thought to do that since I've never had to wait in line to check in at a hotel before, and I've stayed at hundreds of hotels, even in NYC. 


PROS: 
The biggest thing this hotel has going for it is that it is literally right in the middle of everything... all the good Casinos, clubs and shopping are right next door! Good for walking to stuff. 
Giving it three stars only because they upgraded us to a bigger room 4 doors next to our friends on the top floor. 

Cons: 
The hotel is old and a lot of stuff such as plumbing is out of date (drains were clogged in room) 
1hr+ line to check in \/ out
Large Hotel Fee ($50 for two nights)
Floor numbers written in sharpie next to elevator buttons.

In fact by most standards the Flamingo is outdated. However, unless you want to spend $200 a night for a much nicer and more elegant hotel, the Flamingo will do just fine. The hotel has a surprisingly young clientele, not surprising given its cheap rates. The Flamingo is also right in the middle of the Las Vegas strip. Its really a prime location. The biggest pro of the Flamingo is obviously its pool, which has an lush tropical theme and indeed has real Flamingos walking around. The gambling is also a plus! $10 minimum bets on most games, as opposed to $20 minimums at places like the Venetian or Bellagio. If you're looking for luxury, skip the Flamingo.

Dirty room, leaking bathroom (even with tons of leakseal tape), incredibly dirty windows, lack of even a paid minibar. Lots of rust.

Dislikes:
Because parking spaces were reserved for the Valet service, the Hilton, and Hertz, it was very hard to find a parking place in the ramp.
The check-in process was very slow. I've never waited that long to check in.

Likes:
We thought the buffet was very good.
Our room was clean.
The location was great: middle of the strip.",0,0,0

We, my husband and I, have been going to the Flamingo a couple times each year since spending our honeymoon there. I'd say we've stayed at the Flamingo a total of 10 times in both the GO Room and in their Fab rooms. We loved the rooms, the staff, the cleaniness, the casino. We even overlooked the elevators and the hallways which we knew would eventually be renovated (by the way, they haven't touched the elevators or the hallways in the last 6 years and they looked crappy and smelled even back then). Our last trip has changed us forever. 

Since our last visit, The Linq and the great big wheel of death (aka The High Roller) has opened. You'd think this wouldn't affect the parking situation or the employees of the Flamingo. WRONG! We drove about 6 hours to get to the Flamingo, when we arrived it was late - about midnight. We drove up, like we always had, to valet our car - so it would be easier to get our luggage upstairs and to the lobby. Nope. Valet was jammed full and ONLY open to Seven Star platinum and up members. This is new. So, plan #2 was to park in the parking structure next to the hotel. We've done this before and the walk isn't bad. Too bad there's no parking spaces! Valet took about 1\/2 the structure (and 1\/2 of those spaces were empty so who knows WTF valet was doing with a full valet area in front of the lobby!) and there's about an entire floor dedicated to rental cars (again, only about 1\/2 full). So, driving up and down the parking structure - twice! We gave up and decided to check out where the overflow parking was. In the back FAR, FAR, FAR away from the hotel and practically full! I don't know WTF they were thinking when they built The Linq and The High Roller but they obviously didn't think about people wanting to visit the thing and how it was going to impact paying customers of their hotel. Furious at this point, I just had my husband drop me off at the valet area with all of our luggage so he could park 2 miles away. I went inside the valet drop-off area and found that the escalator going up was out. Got into the elevator. Broke. Tried to ask a valet person on how to get upstairs without taking the actual stairs (my back was sore and I could no way carry my luggage up myself), the 1st and 2nd valet person ignored me. The 3rd valet person finally told me to go to the other entrance and waved his hand in some direction. I went back outside and guessed my way to the other entrance, which was to the right. At this point I'm not only furious but on the edge of tears. Oh, and it's about 2am by now. So with my back aching now, I walk over to the other entrance IN THE STREET BECAUSE THERE IS NO SIDEWALK with cabs honking at me while they're trying to get to this other entrance also, I go inside and guess what? The escalator going up is broke. I find the elevator, which is a winding walk in corridors and doesn't feel like it's for public access. When I finally get to the lobby, my husband shows up and he's now furious because of all the crap I've had to go through to just get to this point - which I'm in a line to get my keys because I had already checked into the room online. When I'm finally at the check-in desk the employee asks about my night - I unleash my story. She's not very sympathetic (which tells me alot of other hotel guests have gone through this same thing which makes it an issue that NO ONE is dealing with!!!!!), offers me a $30 food & beverage credit which I take just so I can get my key and go to my room. No upgrade. No apology. Nothing other than a F&B credit. So, we get to our room and it just doesn't feel clean. We try to call about changing rooms but we couldn't even get the front desk. The Flamingo had us beat. 

The final kicker came when we got the bill at check-out. Their resort fee covers only 1 device on wifi. Both my husband and I agreed to the T&Cs on our phones to use their wifi. It was faster than our cell service. Sure, you can say this was our mistake but I feel their policy for only 1 device is unbelievable!

During our stay, we decided that the Flamingo had let us down and we were never staying there again. I'm not even sure if we'd stay at another Harrah's property again. We were previous MGM properties people and changed over to Harrah's properties back when they didn't have resort fees. Now that all Harrah's hotels have resort fees, not to mention some of the highest on the strip, and due to the service we received during our last visit, we are gladly returning to being MGM property people.

I don't care what anyone says,.... This place is not a legend and not history. It I a hole in the wall on its last leg. WAITED in line to check in for 45 mins. WTF

It started bad,... When we drove into town and up to the flamingo we could NOT GET IN ! There is construction surrounding the hotel and there is NO front entrance for check in on the strip to drive your car up. After calling and sitting on hold FOREVER, we was directed into the back check in. I was dropped off while my sister went to FIND parking. Turns out its either parking a block away on the street or on the last floors of the garage. Imagine walking with your bags.... 

Got the room, and opened the door...SMOKING ROOM, and horrible décor. Called down and changed rooms ( sat on hold for 10 mins ) . Bellman came up but with no carry all..so we waited for him to come back...The bellman talked about the cosmo hotel THE whole time ..I now know why. It was a hint to run not walk somewhere else. 

New room upgrade ( we paid) was fresh the go room was nice . White décor and flat screen TV's are a bonus . 

Hotel elevators are a long wait and one broke down. The flooring was HORRIBLE and walls are dirty. No real club in this hotel, and the bar club had locals in it trying to pick up drunk chicks. 

Room key didn't work..went down to get another... STILL DIDNT WORK, went down at 1 am on a Saturday because we couldn't get in the room. Back out and came back to NO PARKING and we had to park dwn the street and walk. DANGEROUS MUCH ? 

Pool party was nice, no real shade areas neither man made or real,in 100 degree weather, this is a no no. but, a good mix of music.

20's 30' crowd and cheap older adults. Class is NOT a option here.

Clean room, nice views of the fountains at the Bellagio. 

Cons:
False alarm sirens that went off twice during our stay, at 3:30am.  This was not just a little beep. Full on siren mode, scare the piss out of you.  Then once it stopped, no explanation. 

Not turning over the room daily.  They just give us enough towels for one day. We booked for seven days.  I expect fresh towels every day. No brainer. Did not happen. 

Three out of six elevators do not work. This caused delays during peak hours.

Next expectation:  When your in room menu says you deliver room service until 11pm, we expect that to be true.  But nooooooooooooo, we were told the menus we're outdated and that was just too bad for us.  

Flamingo, I like the room we got, I like the view.  But you failed on soooo many levels I doubt I will return. 

The saddest part is, that I held on the phone for a better part of 20 minutes to speak w a supervisor and there was no one available. 

Stayed here because of a conference. One of the speakers made fun of the duct tape patches on the carpet leading into the conference area. Flamingo, you should be embarrassed. The upstairs conference room was ridiculously cold and not enough chairs were available for most of our sessions. We were told at one session to grab some from a room next door.  Why are your paying patrons doing the job of your banquet department?

All of these things separate would not make me consider giving a poor review.  I think the room service menu was a deal breaker for me. I can't believe a multi million dollar casino cannot afford to update their menus.",0,0,0

The second best part is the awesome pool area, however, you have to get there early to get good sun beds.
The best part is location, location, location. The flamingo is located in the middle of the Strip which means the best parts of the strip is in the surrounding areas (best shops, best restaurants). It can be a pain to walk long distances when it's 110 degrees outside. 

The cool thing with the flamingo is that the flamingo is the first hotel on the strip. This can also be a bad thing since some rooms aren't yet renovated which means they're worn out. This is the reason why I give the flamingo 4 out of 5.

Meanwhile another male sales rep acted as if he was an usher for the hotel and wanted to give me directions and grabbed my room key from my hand ""let me see"" and then proceeded to give me directions to my room (which differed from the front desk directions) but not before trying to give his sales pitch. I was uncomfortable that this stranger now knew my room number!  This bothering continued for the two days we were there.  I let concierge know but they clearly did nothing.

Valet pretends that valet is ""free"";  while the guys work on tips - it really is part of the resort fee.

There is no fridge in the room which is standard these days.  The bathroom sink hardware was rusty and didn't drain properly; there were only three towels (we had 4 people in a double room); there was only one standard plug on the nightstand shared by both beds; WIFI (part of resort fee) is limited to two devices per room (um most people have at least one device so this is unreasonable for 4 people in a room); the outside windows were so dirty, photo taking was awful.  We had a do not disturb sign on our door but housekeeping still proceeded to knock on our door at 8:45 the morning of checkout.

4. We were charged a deposit of $100 at check in. We were again not told about this when reservation was made.(No deal we had that covered).
5. Gave us a 2 queen bed view away from the strip. Which we were reserved for.
6. There was a hole on lower bottom, inside of bathroom door.  (Management had the nerve to ask me if hole was there before we checked in or after. Someone forgot to check & I have videos
7. The WORST on our second night, we had little roaches coming out of bathroom sink. I know I should of reported it but we got back at 2am from a club. Beware: room 10142
8. The next day, which is check out day. I got ready in the bathroom and while blow drying my hair. Another roach popped out from behind wall mirror. The heat in bathroom made them crawl out. I quickly got my stuff together and checked out! 
9. At check out management tried to comp me a day's resort fee. Said its because of weather change, what caused the bugs to crawl out? She a knowledged that they have bug problems.   
I'm like excuse me!! We slepted in that room for 2 night's & only comped one night. No way Jose. I asked management for a free room voucher. Answered No!
Then i said well comp me for the two nights. To no wait they agreed.

Anyway, we love Paris, but since this was our 3rd trip to Vegas in 5 months, we tried to keep a tight budget, and since we were staying on the most expensive nights (Fri-Sun) we chose to check out Flamingo.  

We arrived at about 10:30pm on a Friday night, so check in was a little busy. I had requested a standard room, nonsmoking with a king bed, but when we arrived they said that all was available was 2 queens. Now, I am not ok with this, especially since I vacation to Vegas usually for romantic getaways with my honey. I sleepy on a queen bed at home, it is nothing special. In Vegas, I want a king. The hostess was finally able to get us a king in a wheelchair accessible room on the 6th floor. 

The real problem is was when we went to bed (1 am ish). We stay in Vegas a lot and are aware that hotels are not silent, but you could seriously hear everything. You know the noise that iPhones make when you plug them in to charge? It is not a very loud noise, and we could hear it clearly from the next room over. We could also hear every word of EVERY conversation. After waking up to ""oh my god I forgot my toothbrush"" and ""you are 27? You are so much older than me!"" at 6am one morning, I decided to complain. We were then moved to the 14th floor without much trouble, and upon exiting the elevator it was obvious that the 14th floor was in much better shape. The noise level was much better, and the walls were obviously thicker.

The rooms are a fairly decent size and there is plenty of rooms for bags\/dressing\/doing makeup\/etc. I myself am a fan of the fun pink décor. 
I would not recommend the flamingo for a romantic weekend getaway. Try Paris or even the Rio for that. I would recommend it for a friends or family trip, as it is definitely a budget hotel. Not a bad experience, but not the same as some of the great Vegas experiences I have had in the past.

I had reserved a Go Room with s Strip view and was getting nervous about getting what I requested after reading some of the earlier reviews. So I bypassed auto check in and had a real person checking me in. I told her of my concerns and was assured I could get the room I had reserved. I decided to upgrade to a mini suite and never regretted it. Beautiful room with a view of the Bellagio. Great maid service. I used the Lobby elevators and had relatively short waits. My travel companions had a Go Room with a view of the Linq. They were very happy with their room as well. I'd say if possible stick with the Go rooms and work with the hotel personnel when you check in to try and get what you want. I guess we were very lucky but after earlier concerns I'd definitely stay there again.,1,0,0

1. From the moment we walked into the hotel until we left, we were harassed from people wanting us to sign up for a timeshare.  I am NOT exaggerating when I say it was constant.  They were stationed at every entrance and at the entrance of every elevator, so you are accosted every time you go to your room or leave your room.  When we complained about it to management we were told that they rent space from the hotel, so there was nothing they could do about it.  
2. On top of the normal room rate we were charged a ""resort fee"", which wouldn't be a problem other than the harassment mentioned above.
3.  Walls are paper thin.  We had very loud people next door.  Usually at 4-6am.  Loud voices, yelling, & our room smelled of marijuana thru the adjoining door.  
4. We went into several other casinos during our stay.  In comparison, they were much cleaner, quieter, & much more classy than the Flamingo.

This is my first time staying on this propert since 2010 (stayed ome night in an updated suite) It's awful the bedrooms are so outdated. The sheets are a piece of tattered fabric, scratchy. All white. The furniture looks like it came from the dollar tree, which would be fine if this wasn't a Vegas resort. The host is awful, they don't give you credit for poker tournaments, they don't give any comps. Yesterday the craps dealers handed me a cover when I inquired so that I could run to the bathroom. They said, we're not responsible if something happens to your chips, which I have never heard ever. Bellagio, Pallazo, Venitian and Wynn are all happy to cover chips without leaving doubt in your mind while you take a bathroom break.

We booked the gazebo in February, and it was absolutely the easiest thing. Over the next few months, we emailed frequently with our original coordinator, later replaced by the fabulous Kris LaBuda, and picked the music, flowers, processional order, etc.  I believe we chose the Lavender package originally, but we added quite a bit of extra photography time, which I highly recommend.  Just make sure you warn any skittish guests that the gazebo is right next to the party pool, and even though they will turn down the music a bit, you will still be able to hear hooting and hollering, and the latest obnoxious radio hits. It didn't bother me a bit, but some older guests were worried. 

Everything was absolutely awesome! Kris answered by hundreds of very detailed questions, and even without a rehearsal, the ceremony went perfectly. Our officiant, Vegas Von, was fabulous and hilarious, and the ceremony was about 10 minutes, which is exactly what we wanted, since at 4 pm in May, half of our 75 guests were in the sun. 

The flowers for my bridal bouquet and my six bridesmaids were gorgeous. 

The photographer, Danelle Freitas from Imagine Studios, was beyond amazing. She showed up to the bridal suite right on time to get pictures of me getting ready, the dress and accessories, and the lovely bridesmaids. Danelle jumped right in and was absolutely wonderful in capturing the ""dress reveal"" with first my family, and then my wonderful husband-to-be.  Please, please see each other before the wedding, people, and get the photos out of the way! Danelle hiked us around the Flamingo hotel capturing some awesome shots, and even though my feet were not very pleased, the pictures are incredible.  Pay for the cd with the photo rights to all your shots, since the prints are expensive and really, nobody wants formal prints, and it's $35 for full rights to each individual image. The only things I would have changed about the entire shindig would be to wear really really comfortable shoes (nobody can see them!) and to maybe add an hour or two of photography time so Danelle could have come with us to our reception at Margaritaville.",1,0,1

Fantastic location
Go Rooms are above average...pretty nice actually. 
Grounds are beautiful.
Pool is fantastic. 
Large selection of games and slots. 

Cons: 
Check in line is hell.
Food options in casino are terrible. 
Fab Deluxe rooms are about as bad as it gets mid strip. 

Tips:

Make use of online checkin. If you don't cause you are trying to do the $20 trick and get a $30\/night upgrade for $20, you are a moron. Seriously, never ever stand in this check in line. Only look at the people in line if you want to see what really dumb people look like.

Don't play 6:5 pay blackjack. Just dont. 

Eat anywhere but Flamingo. Tons of good food options in the Linq, across the street at Cesars, or elsewhere. Midrange, there is Cheesecake Factory and Border Grill at Cesars, Yardhouse near the big wheel, and Hash House a Go Go at Linq. Gourmet...literally some of the best food in the nation nearby....just about every restaurant at Bellagio, Cosmo, or Aria, along with Mesa Grill at Cesars, and just an incredible amount of places in Venetian\/Palazzo. 

Spring the extra dough for the Go Room. If you need more space, the Go Mini Suites are probably the best priced rooms of this type anywhere on mid strip. 

The pool situation is kinda bad. On a hot day theres basically no lounges if you don't arrive right when it opens. Even at the second pool. Flamingo management really messed up on this one and I hope they are not stupid enough to ignore the many complaints I'm sure theyve received on this one. . 

To save on alcohol either go to one of the many CVS or Walgreens locations. Or you can get 24 oz cans of  domestic for $6 or import\/craft for $7 at the Flamingo gift shop thats right before you enter Margaritaville. That comes out to $3 per beer for domestic, $3.50 for import and thats as cheap as it gets mid strip in a casino(except for Casino Royale's $1 Michelobs)

Oh and BTW, resort fee is nearly inexcapable...just factor it in. Exception is Treasure Islands tv special where resort fee is optional but thats only available mid week. And $200\/night mid strip on a weekend is not expensive on busy Las Vegas weekends. If you think thats too much, go at a time when its cheaper. For instance my wife an I are staying right now in a Go mini suite under $150\/night inclusive of resort fees and taxes.",5,0,0

I like my nice rooms with nice big bathrooms with lots of space for me to get ready to party the night away. Not gonna lie, I always thought that Flamingo was one of the shoddier hotels, and yea, it doesn't look as snazzy as the other places, but hey, can't knock it till you try it.

We booked a room here for a last-minute, one-night Vegas trip, and I was pleasantly surprised by the room. It was pretty nicely furnished, and the bathroom was a nice size. Plus we had a nice view of the strip and the mountains, haha. I like the location, how it's in the middle of the strip and equidistant to the Wynn at one end, and New York at the other. Also the bf and I love the pinball slot machines, and there are lotsss of them at the casino here!! He's also a big fan of the breakfast buffet, which is pretty yummy.

First of all, this hotel has two sides: The Donnie and Marie Pink and White Fun Time side and the Peasants covered in basic b*tch side. Guess which side the happy customers are on? Not our side, I'll tell you that. 

It was like everywhere else was covered in shiny pretty lit-up glitter and fascinating lights and then you walk into the dust covered, faded eyesore that is the Flamingo and you're like I have to stay here?!. The check-in line was relatively quick, albeit it was Thanksgiving and most people were not traveling. It was also really cool how nonchalantly the check-in girl told me that they did not have the room we reserved 3 months ago, and they had no more non-smoking rooms left, but she would upgrade us to a bigger room with ""great view."", oh and the list of fees on my reservation failed to include the insane deposit fees which cost more than my room! Like how do they even do the training for that? I just picture some cheapo slimeball like, here's what you want to do, you want to subtly tell them something that can ruin their vacation, but present the info to them with the tone of voice that says 'hey, its no big deal.' 

@#!@#!$@#!@^&%^% And the wifi isn't even easy to use and can only accommodate one person. And the resort fees are for nothing. You are paying for wifi and a gym that doesn't even seem to be anywhere in the entire resort.

The ""great view"" was of the lobby's roof and the pool that is shut down for the season. La di da. And this room was gross. And it was tiny. I had to clean my own toilet because their incompetent staff failed to do an adequate job. The toilet paper itself was held, not on a roll, but on a flamingo pen. WTF?!?!?! The bathroom isn't even big enough for two people to get ready, like helllooo Vegas? That is part of the fun and you're shitting on it. The shower curtain had super gross mold on it. EWWWW. 

The pillow and sheets didn't even look like they had been changed. There were stains on every surface in the room. Sheets, pillows, tub, toilet, walls. Grossss. 

Everything in the room was unplugged when we got in, we had to plug all our own lights in in the dark using the flash lights on our phones. There definitely weren't outlets in the room. I had to plug my phone in on the other side like a freaking common peasant and then get up every time I needed to check something. Basically impossible when you've been having fun all night in Vegas. 

And their room service menu was insulting. I must have reread it like 17 times in the hopes that something appetizing would appear. It was a joke. 

And their food court -OH MY GOD - if I never see another Johnny Rockets burger again it will be too soon. They only had Johnny Rockets, some not Panda Express type place, a pizza place that doesn't even serve Pizza all the time and the strips most okayest wrap place, I think that place had about a million things on its menu, but I don't have time to read a novel when I'm hungover so I just stuck with the basics. The food was all awful. It was like two parts grease for all parts anything else. Eating it was a chore and I will tell you the greasy BS theyre passing off as food won every time because I could not finish any of it. Nothing tasted even remotely fresh and to be honest, I've had better tasting experiences at McDonalds.

If you plan on spending very little time in your room and will be inebriated to the point of not caring about the cleanliness of your room when you use it, this is not a bad choice.  It was one of the cheapest hotels on the strip and the view from the suites were not terrible. They are pet friendly and they did upgrade us to a suite. 

BUT if you look at the pics I (and many others) have posted you'll see how dirty these rooms are.  I found a damn croissant in the corner of my room from the previous guest or possibly even the previous, previous guest (ughhh).  The shower curtain was so moldy I had to keep on asking for more towels since water got on the floor because I showered with the curtain open not wanting the filth to touch my body. I even felt the need to shower with flip flops on because if the shower curtain is that gross who knows how important they think it is to clean the actual tub.  The sink had such a foul smell that I brushed my teeth and washed my face using water from water bottles I bought.

First trip was with friends: had a good room which had a couch and everything. Super comfortable and had a great time. Would have ranked that experience 4.5\/5. The customer service was great and the upgraded us and everything.


External: 1\/5
- The exterior of the hotel is quite large making it very easy to find on the strip. It's not the tallest or the biggest building, but it's probably the oldest. All signs lead to flamingo. The outside is kinda weird looking with a really old Donny and Marie signage. Being in the middle of ceaser's, the linq and Cromwell: all of which are new or really luxurious make flamingo look like a dump.

Internal:2\/5
Casino floor not much better. The check-In area looks fine, but the garage looks HORRIBLE: and there's never enough parking. The casino floor has this horrible orange carpeting. The floors themselves aren't much better. The elevators are missing floor labels AND buttons! WHAT? The first habitat elevator on the left didn't have a button to get to the 17th floor, so we had to wait for another elevator...


Service: 3\/5
- It was great when I needed it, but the fact that I had to need it was a problem. First, housekeeping didn't clean our room so we had to request it at 10pm when we got back. Of course that ment we have to find something to do during that time.
- The wifi is horrible and the fact that we have to pay a resort fee for it is also a huge scam. 
-Uponcheck out I used $90 in comps to pay my room. I had like $20 bucks left and The guy just took the rest off, so the room was essentially entirely free. THANKS!

Rooms: 2\/5 (Double bed high roller view deluxe...)
-the toilet had a water problem and kept draining. Super loud and the water smelled like sewer water. Ugh.
-Plasma screen TV, fully functioning and quiet heater. 
-the room was FREEZING when the heater wasn't on and they turned it off during cleaning so we always came back to a freezing room.
-not enough outlets: we had to unplug some of their stuff so we could charge our things.
-horrible cellphone reception for ATT and Sprint
- the first time I stayed here the rooms looked much better with funky pink shag carpeting and accents on the beds. They were unique and very flamingo. This time we had bare essentials.
- Standard amenities. Nothing here blew my mind, but nothing was subpar either. 
-NOT enough lighting! NO NO NO. Biggest complain is that it was REALLY dark. The curtains do a great job of blocking everything out through. Oversleeping is easy.

Food: 3.5\/5
- there's a small cafe by the elevator that serves the greasiest pizza known to man. The cheese falls right off the pizza: basically liquid.
- the food court is decent. Johnny Rockets is nice and has good service at a decent price. Didn't do buffet.
- Everything is 24\/7: best part.

Casino Floor: 2\/5
-nothing was hitting and the wait staff was pretty rude.
- Margaritaville in fact did not have the $5 advertised craps or blackjack tables. And yes, we were there on weekdays.
- cages are pretty efficient. Though they feel the need to ID people to cash out if they look young... This is a first for me.
-best bet is to just play next door at Cromwell. Everything there is new and clean and professional with similar table minimums. 

Overall not a good trip by any means. Sorry flamingo, you've lost me.",1,0,0

In terms of the room, it depends what room you get. The regular rooms are no frills 3 star hotel amenities. The bed cover is definitely not a duvet. The TV monitor is dated and so is everything else but if you don't mind this, it is decent. The Flamingo has GO rooms which have much better amenities such as a TV in the bathroom mirror, a Denon stereo system, a flat screen TV, and motorized window screens.

The casino is not really that great. If you are looking for the older crowd who is trying to save a buck by staying here, then this is a great place. I rather go to the other casinos on the strip where the people are younger. The games here typically are older than the ones on the strip.

I just ate at the Paradise Garden buffet earlier today. It was alright I suppose. What I really like about the buffet is that they have cocktail shrimp that is fully peeled. Most places do not peel their shrimp. There is a large variety of food but again, it is alright.

I have been to the pool before, the topless one but it is alright. It doesn't have the party scene like the other casinos on the strip. If you are an older person who is here to drink and smoke, this is a perfect place for you.",1,0,0

At first I was skeptical about staying here only because it's an older hotel\/casino! But I was looking for something affordable that my boyfriend and I could stay at, knowing that we wouldn't be in the room that much! 

I was extremely satisfied with the room!!! It was not bad at all, clean, spacious and a view of the pool! The tv wasn't updated, but  MGMs wasn't either only the new rooms which is fine with me, we weren't there to watch tv. I had got a non-smoking room and it didn't reak of smoke at all !!! Which was great! (I have stayed in a no smoking room before somewhere else and wreaked of smoke!) we found a shortcut to our room going outside vs going through the casino! 

Everything was soooo convienent! And I have never had such great service in my life anywhere! That is why they deserve 5 stars... It may not be as luxorious as the other hotels and casinos on the strip! But my boyfriend and I were treated as first class! 

My boyfriend and I wanted a quick bite to eat so we decided to eat inside the casino. Both craving the burger place we saw coming in To check in. So we had asked a man who worked there where it was located instead of just telling us he said ""why don't I take you there myself"" and was so sweet and helpful! Walked us the whole way! Was not expecting that! The food was good and low priced!! Service was great too. Also check in was extremely easy and the staff was very friendly with all the questions I had! Everytime I asked someone who worked there where something was or a question not once did any staff seem annoyed!! Which I'm sure they get the same questions all the time!!!

The best part about this hotel I would have too was also the location!!! Smack in the middle!!!! So convenient right across from caesars!! I am so glad I had such a great experience here. Especially for the amount I paid on the room! Which I think they have there best rates on there website! I looked on so many different websites and they had the best deals! I even called to ask about my room and the telephone service was great too!

It's right on the new LINQ promenade, which is full of great restaurants, bars, and shops.  In addition, there's the amazing High Roller observation wheel.  We stayed in a FAB room, which had a nicely renovated main room.  However, the bathrooms needed a little ""love"" -- rusted door hinges, slight water damage to the door, and peeling paint.  Service checking in and out was very straightforward and friendly.  Overall, very pleased with my stay!

Tip: If you arrive early but want to avoid the early check-in fee and long lines at 4pm - start the check in process and check your bags at the bell desk.  Definitely make it clear that you are NOT fully checking in and that you will get your keys at 4pm.  Double check that the charge is not applied.  Come back at 4pm and go straight to the ""keys & mail"" line.  You can then pick up your keys, call the bell desk from your room and have them sent directly to you!",6,0,0

My first stay I was super impressed. We had a Go Room, and I loved the look and comfort of the room. I didn't find the room dirty at all. Loved the room service chicken tenders after a long night on the strip. 

Because I had such a good experience I decided to stay here again. This time we stayed in a Fab Deluxe room. It wasn't bad by any means. But it didn't have the clean and comfortable feel as the Go Rooms. It was also kind of a trek to get too which was kind of annoying. However upon my second stay I had less then stellar service. I was locked out of my room for most of the stay. The batteries on the lock were dying and I would constantly have to get replacement keys. Literally 3 a day over a 5 day period!!! I left my wallet by accident on the way to a family birthday dinner and couldn't get back into the room because of course my keys wouldn't work. I ended up having to skip dinner. The employees at the desk were in no way helpful. The one guy told me it was obviously my fault and that I kept ""deactivating"" keys and was so unapologetic. Security on the last day finally checked the lock told me it was dying. It was literally the worst experience I ever had on vacation! I called the hotel multiple times to get some kind of reaction and nothing. 

This is the main reason alone I'm debating returning. Why would you wanna treat your customers that way? I paid for a room I could barely get in. So we shall see. 

Pros:
Great location.
Good price.
Good food options that aren't overly priced. 
Room service is excellent. 
Not overly packed. 

Cons:
Elevators are very worn down and dingy looking. 
Bad customer service.",4,0,0

It really just depends I think on the day you go because I've been when it was really fun and times when it wasn't. They were featuring one of the new resident DJ's on the day I went (Sunday) so the music was actually really good and the vibes were awesome! I have no complaints other than the expensive drinks that they have to offer at the pool.. Then again that's EVERY property on the strip! So yeah I know you just have to suck it up and pay.. Drink more and cry later kind of thing lol. The rooms have been remodeled in here (some) I believe because my friends room she was staying in wasn't really that terrible as what I expected it to be.

However, you are in Vegas, the land of lavishes and luxuries. The land where your room is probably bigger here than your apartment, a land where 24\/7 you can lose thousands of dollars and still remember it was a happy occasion. In a land like this, you probably would not want to stay in the Flamingo. Despite the Flamingo being probably a pretty good stay elsewhere, this is not the place you want to be when you are in Las Vegas.

Everything is just ok, like many reviewers said, and everything is less grandeur than what you could be getting for almost the same price elsewhere. I found out that the suites are actually a few hundred dollars, which could buy you a nice place at the Venetian for a night just as well.

What I didn't like about the Flamingo: 

Their Poker Room- It is pretty old school and seemed to be used mostly by locals which are not normally that fun to play with.

Their Elevators - Very slow and old.

Their Restaurants - Nothing that really caught my eye.

Internet - 14.99 a day (WTF?)

What I liked about the Flamingo:

Their Location - The Flamingo is located a short walk from my favorite poker room at the Venetian and across the street from Ceasar's. I made great use of the location.

Their Rooms- The room was very nice and even thought the decor was a little funky  thought it was very comfortable for the price.

They offered me a King bed room and an extra rolling cot. I repeatedly told that I should get what I booked but they kept on saying it is not the case. I asked to talk to the manager, manager came and told me they can offer room with King bed as all other rooms are sold. If I do not like that then they can cancel my booking with a full refund. How harsh could a manager be on the face of a customer who has booked a room months back! I took the room and had to accept the rolling cot. 

Next day when I returned to my room at night, I noticed the cot is not there. I had to call guest services repeatedly and arrange for one again. What a pain!! 

Finally few words about their parking lot. 60% of it has been rented out to Hertz or Valet, only few spots are available for the hotel guests. The lot stinks as they do not clean it.

I was walking through the casino with my family (including two teenage kids) on a tour of the strip and was explaining to the kids how gambling works. They were curious to see what a casino chip looked like so my husband walked up to an open Black Jack table (as in no one was at the table) and asked the dealer if he could buy a $1 chip. (We weren't gambling on this trip so we didn't need anything high value). The dealer was so rude!  He admonished my husband stating he was in a restricted area (no roped off area, or any type of materials were around to indicate the area was ""off limits"" not to mention it was in the middle of he casino floor) and then took the $1, gave my husband the chip and said ""Here's you whole one dollar chip"" complete with an eye roll. 

It's probably not fair on my part to judge the whole casino on the actions of one person, but it's challenging because I can honestly say no other casino we went through where we interacted with the staff were rude. With that one exception, the staff at the casinos were pleasant, helpful and exceedingly polite. When my husband and I return, sans kids, I most certainly will not be giving any of my business to the Flamingo. 

(As a side note, the casino was, at best, worn and outdated; fraying carpet, stains all over carpet and chairs, chairs were dented\/dinged and overall looked bad.)",0,3,0

The first thing we saw when we opened the curtains of our window was a dead bird...needless to say it was a very unpleasant sight. We were put into a Fab Room and it wasn't any better than Any other cheap hotel. The light in the entry way did not work which made the room kinda dark since there wasn't much light in the room to begin with. Our bathroom sink only had scalding hot water and there wasn't any cold water. The bed was extremely uncomfortable and the pillows were too dense and hard.  Also the bathroom was tiny and toilet took forever to fill back up. The walls seemed so extremely thin, we heard our neighbors' phone vibrating!

We were disappointed to see the room had no fridge, microwave, or coffee maker. 

Our room did not match the quality of the lobby or casino. We felt tricked to see a beautiful lobby and casino when our room failed to please us. Luckily we only stayed for one night.

The only good things about the hotel were the outdoor habitat and the easy self-check in process (however one of our cards ended up not even working, go figure).

We decided to not use the self check out process so we can speak to an actual employee about our issues. We ended up being checked out by Brenda who didn't even ask us how our stay was. She seemed quite unpleasant and when we told her all of our concerns she looked like she didn't care and said she didn't know who could handle those things.

While no one from security or ""engineering"" came, the older gentleman who brought our luggage up (yes, took almost 1 1\/2 hours to get bags after we arrived) finally took care of the matter, or at least the loud ringing noise.  He stood on a chair and started poking around and unplugging things to finally get it to stop.  

We called security again, and the very rude gal answering the phone transferred us to the front desk- she didn't even want to deal with the situation.  However, the phone just keep ringing, ringing, ringing, and no one ever answered.  We finally had to go downstairs.  We spoke to the night manager.  He reported someone would come and address the situation- RIGHT-We heard that before.  We finally had to leave as we had two hungry small children who could not wait any longer.  

When we came back, the manager was unsure if the situation had been handled, as the ""system"" had not been updated.  He said if there seemed to be any problems when we got upstairs, just to ""call"" him.   Well, it was not ringing, but how were we to know if it was fixed???  Thank god our room was next to the emergency exit in the event there was a real fire.  Manager agreed to comp the room for the night (at my request).

When you go to Vegas you have to know how to play the hotel game otherwise you will end up unhappy like the people below me. We had a fabulous time at the Flamingo. In fact, out of the 3 hotels we stayed at it was my favorite. 
What is the ""secret"" hotel game that ensures one a wonderful time, you ask? Well it's simple really...This may come as a shocker, but hotel staff don't know you nor do they care whether or not you enjoyed your stay. They aren't paid based on whether or not you had a good time, they are paid by the hour. Now if you have ever worked in the service industry, you have been scolded at many a times, in fact it can sometimes be a daily occurrence. And as it has so been proven, being scolded does not provide an incentive to give better service. So how do you ensure yourself a good time at the Flamingo (or any hotel in Vegas)? You give them an incentive at the beginning to provide you good service...(*ahem* slip the front desk person a $20 when you check in). That may sound absurd, but like me you probably would've lost it in black jack anyway so might as well ensure you have a nice room to go back to. 
Anyways the front desk service provided was wonderful. We checked in early and got upgraded to a nice king room on one of the upper floors with a great view. The room was clean and the beds super comfy. You cannot beat the location of the Flamingo, it is right in the heart of the strip. The casino was fun and lively as it got later in the night. We also used the fitness facilities which were small and don't have a locker room, but got the job done. I had to take a star off, because the pool wasn't open and I was really looking forward to it.

One lady from guest services was so rude and gave us attitude for no reason. The housekeeping lady was nice though. 

The guy who checked us in was very nice and gave us a great view of the strip. 

Besides the location of the hotel there is nothing great about it.",7,0,0

On Thursday, I took a trip to Vegas to celebrate my friend's bachelorette party.  The bride to be and I were first timers, so the maid of honor did all the planning for us including booking our stay at the Flamingo. Also,  the bride to be and I were the first to arrive at the airport which was 11am. Vegas check ins aren't until well over 3pm, so we left the airport and killed time at In-N-Out burger to eat, catch up on old times, and wait for the MOH to arrive. 

Later that afternoon, our group was together and the MOH stood in the mile long line to get the room keys.   There were only four employees working the check in and hundreds of people in line,  it took nearly an hour just to check in.  We saw a sign that said: ""rooms on the 14th floor or higher, take the Habitat Elevators"" ( the elevators closest to the Flamingo and bird exhibits) so we went up to find our room. What we found instead was a literal work in progress. We stepped off the elevator and to our left was caution tape blocking off an area of rooms down a dusty hallway.  We thought we were lost until we found people coming out of rooms from the right of us so we continued on only to find that our number was back where the construction site was located. ..
There was mold, debris, dust, the ghosts of Wayne Newton and Dean Martin, and creepy uprooted carpet that reminded us of 'The Shining.' the MOH quickly called the front desk and the concierge didn't even know what floor we were talking about. So she told us to come back down to the front and she would direct us to our room. We ended up walking all over the casino, getting the runaround twice before we found the right place.  I already knew off the bat that we weren't getting the nice room that's advertised on the website judging by the same creepy hallway and blocked off caution tape section near our room (different building by the way, from the original horror movie floor) and we went in and were highly displeased.  The only modern thing about our room was the floor and the paint on the walls. There was mold in the shower and on the shower curtain,  nasty stained caulk. ..there was nothing Fab or Deluxe about this room. For an extra $30 per night fee, the MOH was able to call and do a room upgrade (called the GO rooms) which should have been complimentary from all the mess we'd been through. 

We packed our things after about 20 min. in the room and once more we journeyed across the casino and waited in the line to get the new keys. Once we got off the elevator to the 19th floor, I saw the funky, new, carpeting that I'd recognized from the website and took a huge sigh of relief.  Our room was adorable especially the view and the bathroom where I took advantage of watching TV from the shower as often as possible. 

So here is the Flamingo in a nutshell:

Pros: 

- beautiful exterior and interior for one of the oldest hotels on the strip. 

- Margaritaville Casino and restsurant downstairs.

- Flamingo habitat,  pool deck, and wedding chapel.

- express check out saved us a headache and hours in line.

- bag check before check in and after check out while waiting for a taxi was very reliable.

- directly connected to the Linq outdoor shopping and dining center.

Cons:

- they have people living on the floors that are still under construction for renovations...health hazard much?!?

- getting the run around  from concierge because they didn't know where our room was located.

- False advertising for rooms on the website. And you have to pay extra for a room you initially thought you were getting.

- resort charges include spotty wi-fi for only ONE device and gym usage that isnt even open 24 hours.",4,0,0

Another Dimond Member friend during the same visit in another room was also over charged $400. Thankfully they reversed the charges but it was an additional hassle. To boot our remodeled room. . .first use of the bathroom toilet the handle broke off as I flushed & the shower head broke off during first rinse.

If you stay here, I highly recommend a GO room - only! The GO rooms are modern, have great amenities like flat screen tv, iPod connection, DVD, mirror tv in bathroom, remote controlled drapes and very roomy. The first night a GO room was not available so we were offered a smoking room with a view- I could not believe the shabbiness of this room. I almost called Harrahs to switch hotels. The room compared to a GO room felt like we were not even in the same hotel. Small, reeking of smoke, dark, old smelly carpet, ugly old furniture, scratches on the furniture, tiny bath and countertop -just terrible. I went back to front desk, still no GO rooms- so we moved to non-smoking room a slight upgrade from the smoking room. It was just ok for one night. The next morning we moved to a GO room for four nights and we loved it. We enjoyed the adult GO pool for an entire afternoon and had a blast!

The main reasons why we decided on the Flamingo was the price and the location. It's located in the middle of the Strip, which is great for when you want to do a bit of sight seeing and walking around to check out the other big name hotels.

Although the location of the Flamingo is ideal, don't expect the same luxury as you would get at the Wynn or anything. Flamingo is one of the older hotels with rooms to match. The both times I stayed, not all lamps\/bulbs were working. Rooms kind of have a musty smell to them... I had to call guest services twice to get extra towels. But hey, the Flamingo did its job!

The habitat exhibits and the pool are pretty cool. Nice addition to our stay. & perhaps another reason why we decided on the Flamingo again was the Burger Joint, which is located right next to the elevators. Perfect for finishing off a goood night, lol.

Good price and in the middle of the Vegas trip. If you simply see your hotel as just a place to sleep and shower, the Flamingo is a good place.",1,0,0

We stood in line for a minute before I saw they TR line (they have a man standing next to the line telling people they could check out using the kiosk, but for some reason he never mentioned the TR line).  We were able to check-in in the empty Total Rewards line (thank goodness). 

Room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The garden area is really nice to sit in and have a drink. The food options are kind of slip. They do have a over priced food court (I guess its not that over priced for Vegas), buffet, and a few other restaurants. 

Also, the cellphone reception is HORRIBLE!!!!!!  I could not make any calls in my room. 

Not my favorite hotel out of all the Caesars hotels though. I doubt I would stay there again if I have other rooms comped. There was just something I didn't like about it. But, if you want a reasonably priced room its a good hotel.

I'll start with the check in process; horrible.  We arrived at 11:00 a.m. And was told that if we wanted early check in it would cost $30.  Obviously the room was ready, why should it cost an additional $30 to check in?
The room:  so we paid the additional $30. the bathroom was just gross.  Hard water deposits all over the shower.  The faucet on the shower was loose.  The sink drain was stuck had to pry it up with our hands. The toilet had to be flushed up to three times before everything went completely down.  2 lamps in the room for light and only one worked.
Pool:  was to open at 9:00.  Never opened before 9:20
Elevators:  out of 6 in the elevator bank, 3 were broke down the entire time.  Long wait times.

1. The Habitat elevators were disgustingly filthy.  The rest of the casino felt fairly clean, but please, someone, polish the brass regularly and wipe down the buttons!

2. New vinyl floor in the rooms = tons more noise from room to room.  We literally were able to conduct conversations with the girls next door, and we didn't know them.  We had adjoining rooms, but the doors were closed, and there was a 1"" gap between the floor and the bottom of the door.  Either put plush carpeting back in, or add weather sripping to muffle some of the noise.  This was awful.

3. No coffee machine in the room?  When was the last time you stayed in a hotel without a coffee maker?  $240\/night should include basic necessities if you ask me. Coffee, fridge (also not included).

4. The blankets were inadequate.  They delivered more when we called for them, but again, I point to the room price - this should not be an add-on.

5. Terrible shower head and mold in the bathroom.

6. Hall carpet needs to be replaced.  It was stained beyond repair, but worse, buckled in places, causing trip hazards.

The good: the casino air quality was great.  I didn't leave feeling like I'd smoked a pack of cigarettes.  The Go Pool was lovely.  The beds were extremely comfortable.

 This is my second time at the flamingo. Several years ago we came here for our first trip to Vegas, we really enjoyed it then. However, this time our experience was not the same.

 First off..check in. What a line, that didn't seem to move. We Sat in line for about half an hour moving about ten feet. Finally we saw someone using the express check 
in kiosk, we decided to give that a try. Good news, we were checked in in about ten minutes, bad news,  no one to tell you about the fact that you get two passes a day for the gym or free internet, especially since the sign in your room says it costs money!! Total bullshit.
So I picked a non smoking room on the 19th floor.
First the elevators, which where old and dingy and dirty. A couple times they stopped on odd floors, opened the doors about 5 inches and just sat there until we hit a button. Alot of beeping and squelling.

 Our room happened to be the farthest room from the elevator which made us walk thru what had to be a smoking room area. The smell walking thru this area to get to our room was disgusting. I seriously wanted to throw up. The carpet was so old and stained and dirty. Riped in many places, and so jacked up that it was rippling down the hall. I tripped over it a number of times. Having had back surgery recently this was very hard and dangerous for me to walk on.
The main room itself was ok. Actually liked the firm bed and at first liked the faux wood laminate, however this is really annoying late at night when drunk people are stomping around, and also really hard on your feet after lots of walking.
The bathroom was horrible! Filthy old and moldy. The toilet paper holder was falling out of the wall. The bathtub was moldy around the edges with the soap holder all cracked and broken tiles. Mold on the ceiling and old broken fixtures. The cabinets had chipped old paint and were separating from the wall.  Even the cups were paper. 
Overall this place made my skin crawl. I will never go back.
On a positive more, if you go to the buffet around 1030, you pay for breakfast, but they start bringing out the crab and other lunch items, but you only pay for breakfast.

Location is about all The Flamingo hotel has going for it.

Check-in was long. Once at the desk, our ""upgraded room"" (that was paid extra for) did not match the description as provided. We were instead placed facing the Imperial Palace hotel on the North side of the hotel. No view of The Strip or the pool, as boasted. Asked for another room and was awarded a lovely (sarcasm) room on the tenth floor with a great view (more sarcasm) of the roof of the casino and the back of the hotel's lighted signage. Bummed.

The room was weird. The furniture was scuffed and the bed lacked blankets, just sheets and a weird pink furry deal at the foot of the bed. One of the room's two lamps was without a lightbulb and the bathroom lacked lighting altogether. There was a constant running water sound in the bathroom, as well as a sewage smell that remained throughout our stay. Two of our four towels has mystery stains on them. The fancy ""ceiling to floor windows"" were unclean and spotty. The ""hardwood floors"" were a cheap laminate that was dusty and weird.
The walls between rooms are either super thin or this place attracts loud patrons. Either way, we were awakened at 8:00 a.m. one morning by a loud woman's voice from an adjacent room and at 9:15 a.m. another by a maid who entered as she was knocking. Who's awake that early in Vegas?!
The elevators displayed some lovely tagging as scratched into the metal interior. The Shining-esque hallways provided discolored and worn carpet with occasional ripples, ideal for trip hazards. 

The pool closed super early...5:00 p.m. And hotel guests were not permitted to take pool towels out of the pool area, instead you dry off in the gateway and drop your towel.

However, you can upgrade to a ""Go"" room for $20 a night more, and that room is ready right now. They're not quite suites, but they're as close to suites as us lower middle class types can get. The room is decorated with very plush furniture, wallpaper reminiscent of a 1940s ice cream parlor, and a pink bathroom with a television built into the mirror so you can watch yourself defecate and CNN at the same time -just like rich people do every day. Of course the best perk of all is that these rooms, at least the ones I've been in, have all been right next to the elevator. If you've stayed in a Las Vegas hotel before then you probably know how annoying it is hiking your way through a vast corridor every time you want to go down to the lobby and tell the hotel staff that you've stopped up the toilet again (no more poop jokes, I swear). Personally, I think they're totally worth it.

The casino: Aside from being very pink and very orange, it's nothing special. On a slow afternoon you might be able to find low stakes Blackjack, otherwise, be ready to shell out at least $20 a hand. Craps tables can be a bit lower, and they do offer daily tutorials on how to play Craps for those whose internet search skills are stuck in 1998 doing the Jesus dance with the monkey drinking its own urine. The goal obviously is that you end up playing Craps at their tables and, hopefully, compelling your child into a future life paying high interest loans from DeVry. Also, the cocktail service was about as dry as the desert surrounding the city. If you want close gaming, I'd recommend a fifty foot walk to Bill's Gamblin' Hall next door.

The pool: Very good. Not the best on the strip, but still relaxing. It gets a bit chilly, but on a 110 degree day it doesn't matter much. Of course, the pool side Blackjack tables don't keep you free from the casino's greedy clutches, but who cares? There's a waterslide!

The buffet: It's pretty unremarkable -for breakfast anyway. I've snuck into senior citizen brunches more exciting than this. There are more interesting buffets near the Flamingo for the same price. 

Overall, this would be the ideal place to stay for a Vegas vacation. Yeah, the food, gaming, and entertainment may be pricey and mediocre, but you're not buried into one sector of the strip. It's an easy walk to pretty much anywhere to get whatever the Flamingo might be lacking.",4,4,2

Just passing through to have a night out with friends on the strip. A buddy of a buddy was in town, so we did the strip thing. After valet'ing my car I walked through the casino, and decided I needed to have a beer. There was a bar I walked by, I think it was called the lobby bar, and asked how much a beer was. The bartender told me the prices and I opted for a Hefe in the complimentary Miller lite football glass. It was 16 oz, and I got to keep the glass for $6. Not a bad deal for the strip. I walked down to Bill's Gambling hall where my friends were playing cheap roullette and we had a fun night. The casino stinks like smoke, it was overpacked with a bunch of touristy idiots, and all the tables were full that were open. And there were plenty of tables not even opened, on a saturday night!! 
When I walked back through to get my car, it was still packed at 1 in the morning. The valet attendants were nice, and my car came in about 4 or 5 minutes max.

I paid extra for one of my 3 rooms to be upgraded to strip view for my nieces first Vegas visit. The problem is the view is obstructed by the Donny & Marie sign that covers the building. You can't even take a clean picture! Why pay extra for an obstructed view???
The man who was assisting with those in line was rude yelling to people that they had to pay $30 more to check in before 3.

But to be honest, I've stayed in Hamptons and Marriotts that had a lot nicer and cleaner rooms than this place. It also took 45 minutes to check in. Two people were checking people in and the line was so long. Finally more people came after a half hour. 

The bathroom was gross. Not very clean. I definitely didn't want to touch the shower curtain. The tub was rusty and the faucet and shower head leaked the whole time. The sink had rust and chips all over it, too. 

The beds and pillows are hard, you will wake up with a sore back. Our one lamp was out and the other had rips all through the shade. 

The elevators are old and a lot of the buttons don't even light up. I didn't trust them! The carpet is also super outdated. 

I know they have renovated rooms but why not do ALL of them?! I know this is an old hotel but come on! If you can upgrade half of your rooms, why not do them all? 

The pool was nice. But it sucks that you can't bring your own drinks. Of course they want you to spend an exorbitant amount of money on their drinks. I suppose that's at every hotel, though.  

When booking the room, it said my view was the High Roller Strip view, so I paid extra. Yeah, there was no Strip in my view. Just the high roller, and parking lots. Also, I don't like that you have to check in at 4pm and check out at 11am or get charged. Next time I come to Vegas, I will definitely stay at a different hotel.

The rest... the casino's ventilation system is in need of a major overhaul. The cigarette smoke saturated the casino to the point where I could not keep my eyes open. The walk to the room via the elevators was gross. The elevators were dated, worn and the floor lights did not work. The carpets were dirty and the ice maker on our floor was broken. It's an older casino, so not a big deal.

The rooms were what was expected for the price we paid and I was going to give the Flamingo 3 stars, but...

On the way out of the room, we saw a bed bug. This is my first experience with a bed bug and who knew they were so fast! We stepped on it and looked it up to confirm. Yep, bed bug. We saw none in our room, but we thought we would still let the front desk know. The woman behind the front desk responded with a synopsis of what a bed bug was and its traits. Thanks, Wiki, but maybe you needed to be more concerned with this guest's experience. She then proceeded to tell me they were nocturnal and implied I was making it up by stating the time of day. The hallways are always dark, you boob, and bed bugs don't wear watches. I wasn't looking for a comp, just someone to acknowledge and do something about the guests if it became an issue.

This lack of customer service dropped my rating from a 3 to a 2 star.",0,1,0

Arrived to the hotel at 12:30, the line to check-in took about an hour and half. The room (Fab Deluxe, double queen) was dirty, and the water pressure in the shower was not great. Saw cockroaches crawling up the walls in the hallways and the elevator was sticky and buttons were missing. My key deactivated several times and I was unable to get in the room The Flamingo really smells like cigarettes, more so than other hotel\/casinos I visited. NO WIFI: costs 20 dollars per night.

Pros: great location, right in the middle of the strip. The flamingo habitat is beautiful and the GO pool looked amazing although I didn't go. Exits to the Linq, a great mini strip with retail stores and restaurants. Tip: go to the starbucks right outside for free wifi. 

Went to Vegas for a conference so the room was paid for, but I understand that the Flamingo is one of the less expensive Vegas hotels. You get what you pay for, I guess. If you're going to Vegas for fun and won't be spending too much time in the room, it's just OK.",0,0,0

When we got the LV we headed straight to Flamingo and the check-in counter. It took us maybe 15 or 20 minutes too get throught the line but it didn't seem so long since there was a lot around us to distract us. When  we got too the counter all went smoothly until the lady who was helping us told us they had too put a hold on our credit card of something like 100-150 per night. I was shocked but we put the CC down and then left for our room. 

When we got too our room we were very dissappointed. We got a very plain room that had not been updated in some time. I called the front desk and asked if we could get a different room and they not only gave us a different room but also upgraded us to a GO ROOM. Now when you get off the elevator to your floor the first thing you notice is that everything is bright pink and it takes some getting used too but its okay. Now when we got to our GO ROOM we were very impressed. Again very pink but so nice. The room was great and very comfortable. We really liked the TV in the mirror in the bathroom but best of all we loved the beds. These beds in the GO ROOMS are too die for. Hands down the most comfortable beds in all of Vegas. It was very hard to even get out of bed each day because we were so comfy.

We didnt spend much time in the casino but we did go look at the pool and it looked very nice. We also ate once at a cafe I cant remember the name of but it was right next to Flamingo Habitat. As I remember it it was okay, not great but okay.

Got a peek at a few other rooms and they weren't nearly as nice as the suite. Only complaint is the room smelled of smoke. It was so bad we had to remove the covers. 
One note, person who reserves the room must show ID to check in even if the other adults are listed. It took us a few tries to get enough keys, etc for all 4 adults on the reservation. 
This is only a 3 because of the suite otherwise for the price I'd select a 2 for a regular room.

Our room had an awesome view of the strip. We were on the 24th floor and we were able to see some of the outside shows from out room. The beds we're comfortable and the sheets were clean. My only complaint is that the beds seemed a little small. We asked for 2 queen sized beds and they felt like full-sized ones. The bathroom was clean and we always got good room service. We would leave for a while and when we'd get back our beds would be made. Fresh towels and empty garbage cans.  Overall the rooms were great.

The service from the employees was good. They were all very helpful and gave us good directions and helped us get our moneys worth. The valet always had a taxi and\/or limo available for us, (we were a group of 8). While in the casino, the attendants would bring us drinks and were very attentive. We ate at one of the buffets for breakfast and the food was all very good. It was a little limited in the variety but the quality was satisfactory.

Elevators looked pretty worn but they got us to the 27th floor ok. Go down the hall looking for our room and see the maids cart, yes you guessed it room is not ready yet.....Ahhhhh..... So we push her cart out of the way so we can drop or stuff in the room and get some dinner, maid is nowhere to be seen...""Hello, we are just going to drop our luggage off"", no answer, I try again, this time she answers, she was cleaning the bathroom , about this time we start looking around the room and figure out that it's a bit larger than your average hotel room. Heck, this room was almost as big as my whole house, yes my house, your could fit 4 normal rooms inside this one suite, 1 Bedroom with a king size bed and room to spare, 2 bathrooms one with a two person tub, a wet bar, and a living room, with a view of Caesar's Palace and the Strip, the living room alone was almost 1100 sq feet, add another 600 sq feet for the bedroom, bathrooms and bar and you have a sweet room.
Wife wanted to know what I paid for the room, $54.00 + tax, I guess it was just the luck of the draw and no one wanting to pony up the money for the room so they filled it with a lucky winner from the self service Kiosk line or who knows how, all that matters it that it was mine for a night, kind of sad that I didn't book it for the week.

So -1 Star for the room not being ready when we check in, -1 for the old elevators, -5 for the people trying to sell timeshares in the Casino and + 10 for a killer room at a killer price.

I  am sorry I cheated on you with The Flamingo! I let their cheap rates sway me from your wonderful hospitality! 

With that said...on to the review!

I stayed at The Flamingo over Christmas and have never been so disappointed with  a stay in Las Vegas. It started at Check In and never got better. I gave the clerk my Credit Card and she said it was declined. I knew there was a problem because I always check my balances before trips and this card was at Zero. I gave her my Debit Card instead and proceeded to check in. I think one of the reasons we had trouble was that the clerk was extremely reluctant to talk to me. She kept talking to my girlfriend even though the room was in my name and I was paying for the room. It was so obvious that Diane actually walked away at one point.  When we got upstairs I called my Credit Card and was told that the first charge was accepted, but when they received 3 more requests in 2 minutes they declined all the charges. So back down to the front desk to straighten things out, which we eventually did with a different Staff Member.

The next day we tried  to go to the parking structure but the elevator was out of order. When we tried to find out what we should do, no one who worked there would or could help us. One front desk employee actually suggested I take the escalator! Totally wrong advice to give someone who uses a wheelchair. What if someone followed that crazy advice and got hurt? Eventually, I did get an answer, but not from a Flamingo employee. A salesperson from the Jewelry Shop near the elevator showed me a path through the wildlife habitat that led to the valet parking area where my girlfriend could just pick me up. I have no idea why the hotel staff wouldn't know about this option.

The next night things went from bad to worse. We got back to our room at 12:30 am. Not late by Vegas time at all. We turned on the TV and were talking about our day when someone started banging on our door. My Girlfriend went to see who it was. They said it was security and that we had to open the door because they had a noise complaint.  We told them it couldn't be us because we just got there. They were insistent, but we continued to say no because we knew we had done nothing wrong. Eventually, they left threatening us with, ""You better keep it down or we will be back."" We did verify that they were Hotel Security through the peephole, so we knew it wasn't just some punks trying to pull something. I have traveled quite extensively and stayed at many hotels in Las Vegas alone and never heard of simple noise complaint being handled like this. A simple phone call would've been enough.

The next morning, we went to talk with the hotel manager with our laundry list of concerns. She apologized and gave us $30 Food and Beverage Credit for our trouble. The weirdest thing was when she told us that Security probably went to the wrong room and that it happens a lot. Really? What if something really bad was going on at the room they were supposed to be at?

If I could split up my review I would give The Casino area 4 Stars because The Staff is always nice and accommodating. I am also quite lucky there including this trip ;) ! Zero Stars for the hotel + 4 Stars  for the Casino = 2 Star Average.  I used to say that I stay where I can get the best deal and play where I want. The Flamingo has convinced me to change that philosophy. I don't think the best deal in the world could convince me to stay there again!",9,6,3

I spent the majority of one day lounging outside at the 21+ pool, drinking 32-oz daiquiris ($18) and listening to great music.  This pool is small-ish, and will charge $10-15 for guys (girls get in free!), but it's awesome.  There are cabanas, daybeds, and couches for rent as well, if you're willing to cough up the dough.  I also took advantage of the sports bars in the lobby to watch a World Cup match and drink a few beers.  I had brunch at the buffet place downstairs, and it was pretty decent for $10.  I also love the location - right across from Caesar's, next to Bally's, and pretty much in the middle of everything.

We had to stay at this hotel for a convention.  The worst part, is that there are actually kind yet professional individuals who work here...just not at the front desk or in management!

I called to confirm ALL of our [9] rooms and check-in times two days prior to our stay.  However, it rained the night we checked in, so the manager was slammed with guests complaining because their ceilings were leaking.

Although we checked in with no one in line at 1245 am, we had to wait almost 45 minutes for our rooms because they said they had none.  Then, they ""gifted"" me an upgraded room and told me that I could move to my originally booked room the next day in the afternoon.  My work colleague was told to check-out from his upgraded room at 10 am and then stow his belongings at the bell desk only to re-check-in at 4 pm.  I found this arrangement ridiculous and inconvenient especially since we got to our rooms at 130 am and had a meeting at 10 am that same day.  I was then told I had to do the same.

After waiting for a manager, we decided to head to our rooms.  The front desk could not call to send my luggage up from the bell desk.  The hotel's LAME policy is to call from your hotel room which I get had it not been after midnight.  

I waited a LONG time and finally called back to see what happened to my luggage...turns out, someone forgot to relay the message.  I received my bags almost an hour later!  At this point, I was boiling.  I would finally get to bath and go to sleep at 330 am...almost 3 hours after checking in and NOT by choice.  

Of course, I called the manager who was hoping that I would enjoy checking out at 9 am so I could be on time for my 10 am meeting.  This was not happening.  [I had boxes for our convention.]  She then allowed me to stay in the upgraded room which you would think would be a perk.  It really didn't counter the fact that the hotel service is poor.

The lobby elevator bank was always busy because it seemed that only half of the elevators worked.  It was so bad that the staff told guests to use other hotel elevators because it was faster.  The elevators near my room - the Spa Elevators - was markedly better, but got busier as more guests ""caught on"" to the fact the the main elevators sucked.

If you want to see where all of the miserable, seemingly enslaved personnel works, then hang out at the front desk.  We had a lot of interaction with them, and with great authority, I can say, that NOT ONE PERSON SMILED.  NOT ONE!

You know who the personable, friendly people are?   The housekeepers and people who work in banquets.  Those employees were happy to help with requests.  They all did what they could and would apologize if they couldn't.  Sadly, they are probably the most under-paid and unappreciated of the hotel staff.

So, back to my new line of thinking.  I now prefer smaller hotels - like the Westin - because you don't have to deal with miserable front desk personnel and managers or long waits for something simple like an elevator.  STAY AWAY FROM THE FLAMINGO, it's NOT WORTHWHILE!",3,0,0

Ok, everything that people are complaining about is probably true.  But...  don't pay Flamingo prices and expect Wynn or Bellagio facilities and amenities.  

If you're a seasoned Vegas traveler you will know that the only thing that matters most if you're not looking to drop a fortune on luxury is exactly what the Flamingo offers:  great location and clean acceptable rooms.  Who cares if it looks dated.  Are you going to spend your entire time in the room?  Why are you even in Vegas?!  

Your view sucked?  Walk outside.  It'll look the same.

It smelled like smoke?  You're a moron.  Welcome to Vegas.

The bed in the Deluxe room does suck (unless you're a hard mattress sleeper, in which case, you'll be satisfied.)  But as long as I can continue to crash here for free while having easy access to the entire strip and the monorail in my backyard..  I'll be back time after time.",8,12,6

The Flamingo pool has water slides for all ages and the pools are truly grand. There's also a party pool for the 21+ crowd. The gardens are open both day time and night as the water falls and koi ponds, plus easy access to the Monorail will take you almost anywhere you want to be on the strip. Location is prime as well as it surrounded brief walking distance from Caesars Palace, The Ballagio, The Venetian, Paris, Planet Hollywood,The Mirage, Harrahs, The Cromwell, The Linq, and Ballys. Plus if you're in town for a convention you can avoid the hassle, the cost and the traffic as the Monorail drops you off at its door step, I believe the monorail is $5 or $12 all day.

So, I labored over picking the right hotel for my three day mini vacation to sin city. My top requirements were a clean room, a pool with slides, and a hotel located on the strip. All of my searches for the best pools in Vegas came up with Mandalay Bay and Flamingo. The Flamingo is a classic and it boasted newly remodeled rooms and was significantly cheaper than Mandalay Bay.
As my title says, this room was gross! The first night I went to pull the sheets down, and I am not lying here, there was a used band aid in the BED!!! I called guest services and they sent a maid up immediately and changed all of the bedding and cleaned the room thoroughly. I should have upgraded or checked out right then. Because it only goes downhill from there...
The bed was hard as a rock. There was mildew in the bathroom. The TV was tiny and was so dim, it was unwatchable. The wallpaper was tearing. The furniture was scratched up. The sink fixtures were rusting. The ventilation ducts were filthy! Where in the heck was the Re-model? The carpet and Flamingo picture on the wall? Seriously? This ""remodel"" looks worse than Motel 6's remodel down the street that I stayed at last year because there were no other rooms available in the city.
If that wasn't bad enough, I find out that same evening that The Flamingo charged me $239 for the room. The problem is that I already prepaid for the entire vacation a month ago. I went to the front desk and asked why I was double charged and was told ""that just happens sometimes."" Really? Well, that's a huge problem! That should never happen. Since I used a debit card, it took two days for that money to go back to my account. Sadly, for the Flamingo, I could have been gambling with that money in their casino, but I avoided their casino after that on purpose.
I also was pretty disappointed that I had to walk so far for the shuttle drop off from the airport due to their construction. Where are the bellboys? I toted luggage so far from the lobby that it was ridiculous!
The first two days the weather was bad. It was cold and drizzling. So, I understand that the pool was closed. However, on the third day of my stay, it had warmed up nicely. The main adult pool was open and going strong with gambling poolside and alcohol sales in full swing. Unfortunately, the water slide area was not open. Why not? It was hot enough and there were tons of people.
I just lived with it all, since I was out of the room most of the time and I was to check out the next day. I did stop by the front desk and informed a Supervisor of all of these issues, and he apologized emphatically. He offered to credit me back two days worth of ""resort fees."" This is a pittance. I very politely asked for the hotel manager's card and forwarded this to her as well. I am certain that the Caesar's company can do much better than two days of resort fees compensation.
As of this review, the Hotel Manager has credited me back with the third day of resort fees and offered a free upgrade from a standard room to a ""Go"" room on my next visit. This is the difference between a regular (crappy) room to a fully renovated room. I do appreciate her efforts in what she has done, however, I think it is not above Caesar's Corporation to comp three days of a future visit IN FULL, in one of the fully renovated rooms or at another property of theirs.",7,0,0

And it's very cheap compared to the other strip hotels aswell. I don't know why so many bad reviews. You get what you pay for.

The security staff was amazing as was the bell and cleaning staff but the manager and desk staff could have cared less.  Also noted security and bell staff are not employees of the Flamingo so maybe the Flamingo staff could learn something from their customer service ways.  We had no cash to even buy gas to get home and she was not willing to credit us anything other than a resort fee. Perhaps getting our deposit fee back in cash would have helped but she was not willing to budge on anything.  Worse yet the gal behind the desk stared at us rudely like we were just a bunch of whiners. Honestly? We just had one of the most frightening experiences to date and we get that kind of response?

Maintenance came in the morning to fix the problem door after we were up all night with security, other victims, and the police.  A bit late?  I have since read the Flamingo is one of the highest crime hotels due to their lack of cameras in the halls and stairways. The manager could have made things better even though the experience was bad enough at that point. Shame on this manager and shame on your lack of video security.  Please do not stay at this hotel.

Seems like someone in a ""suit"" decided to cut corners and save a few bucks at the expense of a regular customer. So, yes, I am already starting to research other places to stay for our annual October trip.",0,0,0

however, the 4 star review is due to the view from our room which was absolutely AMAZING.  we looked right into the strip and we were able to watch the bellagio fountain show from the comfort of our room.  loved it.

also, the cafe at the hotel was a good lowkey breakfast place with reasonable prices which was much needed after spending too much $$ elsewhere in the city.  :)",0,0,0

Two of my friends and I stayed here late Friday night to Sunday morning. On Saturday (our only real day there) we tried to go enjoy the pool here. They had a bouncer at the pool, and we waited about 30 minutes in line to get up there. When my friend went up, the bouncer looked at his ID and said nope, you're not getting in. We asked why and he said ""the shade of blue in the background of your picture looks different than hers."" (We are from Arizona) We told him it was a real ID and asked who we needed to go see to prove it was real. Long story short we went through a million different managers and security employees. One took one look and said ""Nope I'm from Arizona and this is fake, end of story. You are not getting in."" Finally we ended up in the basement of the hotel talking to the top of security (Russ Roak) where he took the ID for about 15 minutes and finally came out and said Yes you are right, the ID is real. But you still can not go to the pool because of everything that happened. We asked what exactly ""happened"" besides us trying to figure out who we needed to talk to so we could go enjoy the pool that we paid the resort fees for when we checked in. He said he didn't know but nothing was going to be done and we could not go plain and simple. He even said to us ""sorry my guys aren't experts on reading ID's"" what??? you work on the Las Vegas strip and your job is a bouncer?? Thats your job!!!!!! At the end of the day they were not professional AT ALL and when we left and told him clearly they were not going to be able to solve this problem so we would contact his manager and he then said ""and that is exactly why you aren't getting into the pool!!""

It was so amazing to look out and see the Bellagio fountain going day or night!  From the electronic window treatments, to the TV in the bathroom mirror, and extremely comfortable beds, I loved all of the modern touches and addition to details they've done.   

Not only are the updates to the room fantastic, the casino is a great size allowing you to be able to find enough different table games and slot machines.  I was upset to see that they got rid of our favorite cafe where we could eat and play Keno, but those are gone from all the casinos so it's just something I have to except now.

I called to have the room aired out or cleaned as there was an odor in the room, no one ever showed up. On day two I went to the pool and ordered $91 worth of food and drinks. Upon checkout it was revealed that the Flamingo charged both my room and my debit card, when I mentioned it to them they said they will remove it from my bill and credit my debit card back the money, to date they haven't done so.

My boyfriend and I booked a room at the Flamingo for a weekend in Vegas. Our friends were staying down the street at the Paris but the Flamingo ended up being $50-$60 a night cheaper so we went with it. When you're in Vegas, you don't spend much more time in your room than to sleep and shower anyway and location is the most important element. The Flamingo has an awesome central location on the Strip and most of the major casinos (Bellagio, Paris, Caesar's, Mirage, T.I., Planet Hollywood, etc.) are a fifteen minute or less walk away. 

Check-in was quick and easy on a Friday night around 8 p.m. There's even a shorter line for Total Rewards members, which is a free player's card that is good at several of the hotels\/casinos on the Strip. Although both lines were short at check-in, it's nice to know that this option exists.

The biggest headache was trying to find a parking spot. We drove around the labyrinth of parking garage several times before we happened to see a car backing up. It was amazing how few parking spots they have available for hotel guests. It seemed like most of the garage was reserved for valet or another hotel. 

As for the room itself, we got a standard room with one king size bed. You can tell that the rooms have been upgraded and they look nice with the new fake hardwood floors (always a plus compared to carpet in a hotel room). The pink throw on the bed might look funny in another hotel but it fits the flamingo theme and my boyfriend even commented that they skinned a flamingo for us. :)

But if you look closely, you can see that not everything has been upgraded. The doors looked cheap and some of the walls could use a bit of touching up. The countertop of the bathroom looked nice but the cabinetry looked incredibly dated and the bathtub\/shower combo is definitely not new. Everything seemed clean though.

We had trouble with the TV remote and not all the buttons seemed to work. I could only scroll through the channels in one direction, for instance. Speaking of the channels, there really could be a better selection. There was nothing interesting to watch. I need my HGTV!

One other complaint, the walls seem to be very thin and I woke up on Saturday morning to a very loud conversation in Spanish happening in the hallway. Considering the length of the convo, I'd assume it was the maids gossiping and not fellow travelers passing down the hall. 

All in all, I'd consider staying here again for the right price. But I've had nicer rooms on the Strip in the past.",6,0,0

The check in process was great but that is thanks to my soon to disappear platinum status which allows me to check in via the VIP room which never has a line and they are more likely to upgrade you to a better room.  Anyway, still some problems with the elevators, nothing too bad but once or twice I got on the ""tower of terror"" one that stops on ever floor and closed on my arm which kind of hurt.  The room was decent and clean and was ready for us earlier than the check in time which is always great.  The most disappointing part of my time there was the experience we had at the pool.  When I stayed at the Flamingo for my first time back in 2007 I was 12 and the pool was great, really big with waterfalls and smaller water slides, they had a 21 and over pool that was in a smaller more secluded part of the complex.  The situation now is reversed, they have the larger pool as the 21 and over pool and the smaller one is now the family pool.  The family pool is kind of small given the fact that people with families are more likely to actually be swimming vs. groping each other which was all that was going on in the main pool.  The main pool's music is far too loud, it would be one thing if it was actually good music but instead it is just new rap music that people in their late 30's can pretend to like in an effort to feel younger, but that's another story.  There are far too many people there as well, they should limit the pool to guests of the hotel only.  It's a real shame because Las Vegas is now designated as the biggest party spot and anyone else can just get with the program or get lost.  To really shove it in the face of people staying here, they close the pool at 6pm.  hmmm I wonder why? maybe because they only care about making money off of cabanas and outrageously priced drinks and they know that the crowd that actually falls for that hits the clubs around that time, but what about the families or older couples that want to go for a quiet swim after dinner? It's the Flamingo's condoning of this ""screw you to anyone not interested in partying"" attitude that I am only giving them 2 stars.  BTW I am 21 years old and was probably the only person at that pool actually in the age group those people were pretending they were in.

We were set up in the ""Go"" rooms, which have pink lights in the bathroom and a t.v. within the mirror (pretty rad!).  The bed was extremely comfortable and I enjoyed the sliding drapes option - was probably hungover two mornings so it came in handy.

The room-service is 24 hours, which is a plus if you're hammered and starving.  The prices were pretty steep but that's to be expected.

We rented a cabana by the family pool which was PACKED.  It happened to be during Memorial Day weekend so I wasn't shocked.  I didn't take part in the festivities being from FL (we have pools in our backyards) and the crowds.   However, some of my coworkers stayed all day and loved it - to each his\/her own.

It has a great location (right on the strip) so no complaints in that department.

The only thing I will say is that some of the bartenders downstairs in the casino were extremely rude and nasty.  I had never been in a casino and was asking some questions about the drinks offered while playing at the bar.  Apparently, you should ask you shouldn't just KNOW.  When I started being rude back to her one of the casino managers stood beside me, which I can only assume is an act of intimidation.  It worked (I'm a tiny girl).

As a family that has diamond level players in the Caesars entertainment system we hoped for some sort of improved service however the front desk staff didn't seem to care, probably because they are always understaffed, and the reception process is far from efficient or well thought out for 2016.  I'm sure it was fine in 1979.  Really, a 45 minute wait at midnight, to get a malfunctioning keycard replaced? Even when I approached and asked politely for a reprint since they didn't key it right in the first place and it didn't work? They had 8 people on shift and only 3 windows were active in helping customers. Even so, the place was sold out, and since we booked a double queens room, they gave us a king, which sucked, because we had the groom for tomorrow's wedding crashing in our room, because his bride to be was having a party thrown at home.. So we figured he would hang with us on bachelor night.  Tried to change, told sold out, couldn't buy another room, and had to force him into a roller bed.  Really? 6.7, 240lbs, on a roll bed on his night before his wedding.  They didn't fix it even when informed by my wife.

The majority of rooms are outdated, with the furnishing your expect at a roadside motel, like paper thin towels, paper thin walls, doors that slam and thinner toilet paper. Carpets need cleansing, and the price is around 80-$120 all in, on a Thursday . 

Without being too specific, I'd say that at least 3 dealers, and a blackjack pit boss were rude, short, and unfriendly.  I guess people are just not happy to work here, and it definitely shows that they have lost the couture of servicing the customer with a smile, and politeness.  With a little attitude change from management to thier down line, I'm sure a warmer couture could be fostered...   Location is awesome, and since they have a great location by the Link and Brooklyn bowl, they feel they can get away with crappy service and quality.  I bet if they upgraded attitude and rooms, they could charge twice the price at least, and be envied instead of avoided.  Flamingo is most often the last hotel you pick..

I have never been hosed as bad as this in my entire life.  First off the person I talked to on the telephone while making reservations made me promises he could not, apparently keep.  

He gave me a quote on a total rate and then I paid the entire stay up front on my credit card.  He sent an email confirmation I did not read and three weeks later I arrived at the hotel.

the clerk told me I had only paid for the first night.  I started to get worried, and then they dropped the bomb, I was supposed to pay DOUBLE THE RATE AGREED TO!! after talking to the ""Guest Services Manager"" Joaquin Osorio expressing my belief a different rate had been agreed to he told me if I would wait and hour he could listen to the tape.  I asked he do so.  (He also lied and said their was no one else I could talk to even though there was clearly other people available).

50 minutes later he returned and told me he hadn't listened to the tape but the department told him they had sent an email confirmation so tough tamale.  I then decided him calling me a liar, his dishonesty about listening to the tape, his first attempt to deny I had made the date the rate locked in and so on that I would rather stay at another hotel.

He told me that if I did so I would forfeit, the ""deposit"" I had put on my credit card.  That was what I had been told was for my entire stay.  So now I had to pay DOUBLE the rate or lose ALL my money already paid.  

I had a friend who came the same weekend and paid HALF of what I paid three weeks in advance.  I asked the clerk if I could just transfer the rate I was charged at to the rate THAT WAS CURRENTLY BEING OFFERED FOR THE SAME ROOMS AT THAT EXACT MOMENT ONLINE.  I was told no.  

Joaquin told me that I had no choice and that I would sacrifice the deposit and try to find a new hotel elsewhere the Friday of Columbus day weekend at 7:30 pm.  RANSOM.  the whole thing took 2.5 hours just to get ripped off.

This is the only con i encountered but needs to be addressed. 

I ordered Johnnie walker black and the lady brought me something else.  I asked it to be changed nicely and was brought back the same exact drink and she said she said she saw the tender pour the correct drink.

Now... im not a fool and i have been drinking the same drink for 5+ years.

First, the resort fee, which was not an option for us, wound up to be fine with me since it covered the fitness facility. Had we not had that charge, it would have been a $10 for each visit (x2 people). Now, sure, many people are not in Vegas to work out. However, we did. And not a bad facility either, considering it is located in a hotel. The spa... excellent. Every hotel seems to have these fees, so I guess- whatever.

Air conditioning\/heating was a bunch of bogus. Thermostat read 65, permanently. It was far from that. It was too warm in the rooms and we could not change the temp. We were in Vegas for a marathon and it would have been great to be cooled down. We bought a fan but that didn't seem to help either. 

Not much of a gambler, but it I was it would not have been my kind of place. 
Old. Stinky. Did I mention old?

We ate at the buffet with the 24 hour buffet pass they have. We also ate at 2 other buffets. The Flamingo was at the bottom. Selection was just ok but there wasn't enough of the items included. Things were gone in seconds it seemed. 

I could have totally done without the fat slob with the plate of bacon, standing behind me chowing it like a flippin cow, while I waited for my eggs. Seriously, there will be more, slow the hell down before you have a coronary.
Oh, but that wasn't the hotels fault, I know. I just wish I had an eject button for that pig.

We ate at Margaritaville and Carlos and Charlies. Both were good. Margaritaville had an awesome band that played 80's and early 90's. Service was a little nicer at Carlos and Charlies, but that seemed more of a restaurant and not just a bar anyway. C&C gave a discount for runners in the marathon, small one, but still an effort. Great guacamole! (for $12) 
The steakhouse looked great, but we didn't eat there.

Check in and out was fast and nearly painless. We arrived at a good time and there was only one couple in front of us, otherwise no line.
Tip for anyone- get the Total Rewards card, not that the service you get is extreme or anything, but you do get points and discounts that help a bit. It's free.

We upgraded to a strip view for a small fee ($15\/night), worth it though. Loved watching out the window, Caesar's is a great view!

To sum up, great location. They have beds to sleep in, a shower to clean yourself, and a toilet. If you get the basic room, expect the basics. If you want it all, get the best room they have, or go somewhere else.",2,0,0

Parking was hard to find - and even the entrance to the hotel, really, because of the renovation. Check-in was quite slow and not very friendly or helpful. The service was kinda bad and the maid didn't even clean our room, so we had to go and ask for extra towels ourselves.

The breakfast is a $6 dollar certificate to the cafe - problem is, there's nothing you can get there for $6 that includes both something to eat AND a coffee, which means that you have to spend extra in order to get breakfast. Besides, the place wasn't really that nice, so more or less seemed like a sales trick to get you to buy something in their cafe.

Now for the Flamingo itself. I admit that I am most definitely overrating this place because of the great experience I had here the weekend of Sept. 20th. (Second time in Vegas this year. Previous stay was in August at the Platinum). But hey, at the end of the day the experience is what counts the most right ? 

So I came with my gf for her birthday. We stayed in a ""deluxe"" room which had little to offer other than a bed and bathroom. It was small but since it was just the two of us it was alright for us. We really enjoyed the pool. It was basically a big party that had a great crowd with good vibes. I forget what it's called, I think it's called the Habitat but either way it's the area you walk through to get to the pool when you're coming from inside the hotel\/casino is really nice. They had flamingos (of course) and other animals. This place made for a really romantic pizza dinner I had there with my gf. We walked a bit and sat at one of the benches with drinks in hand. Really romantic right!?? Lol 

Again the rating is a bit more than I would otherwise give if it wasn't for that romantic pizza dinner I would say 3 stars! Haha but anyway it was definitely a great location on the strip with lots to offer. 

It's Vegas! It's up to you to make the trip great not so much the location. So cheers my friends! Have a great time!",0,0,1

The hall carpeting was worn and repaired with duct tape; trash such as pizza boxes were allowed to sit in the hall for up to 24 hours before being removed by housekeeping.  

The pool was great, but I wasn't a fan of the crowd it attracted and how they were allowed to behave and dress inside the common areas (I thought shirts and shoes were a general requirement in most places).  

My advice is to go to the Flamingo if you want a college pool party atmosphere and a room you can't really damage much further, but look elsewhere if you have children with you or want a more adult experience.",0,0,0

The bed was too stiff, and so were we when we got up each morning.  Pillows were also too hard and stuffed.  

Parking was also difficult when we left on Saturday for a few hours and had to drive around the parking structure several times to find a spot.  Even Valet parking was full.

I did NOT appreciate having my cell phone's internet BLOCKED while inside the hotel, either.  They probably do that so they can get you to pay for Wi-Fi.  Other casinos didn't block my access while I was inside gambling, but I had to go outside or off property to look up directions or get to Facebook.  No bueno!

I give it 3 stars only because our bathtub leaked and our door sign was kind of ghetto (written in sharpie marker...).  Plus it's just a 3-star kind of place, not like the Bellagio or anything.  But you get what you pay for, and for the Flamingo, we got a pretty good deal!

The staff are all pretty punctual and nice at the Flamingo, so if you ask for something they are good at getting you the answer, or extra towels..whatever.

I'll start by saying the staff is really nice. Big win for them. but...

It has zero class, fun... anything. It's not even like it's cheap but fun. It's just horrible. 
My colleagues and I did a group 'bed-bug-check' if that gives you any idea. On a positive note, we didn't find any but you shouldn't be so worried upon entering your hotel room that you feel the need to check. 

The wifi is slower than dial-up. I can't believe they charge a $20\/day fee for it. I don't think $20 is bad- I think waiting 10 min for a page to load is bad. It's more cost-effective to get an increase on your data plan for the month. 

The restaurant 'Center Cut' isn't so bad.  Not quite worth the money but the staff is nice. The only decent restaurant in the joint. I guess Margaritaville wasn't so bad either.

First, my room key didn't work, so I had to trek back to registration which is about 1\/2 a mile away and they made me stand in the registration line again. That took about 35 minutes. Once I got to the front desk, the lady assisting me told me that this happens often and issued me new keys. Went back to my room and again, the room keys didn't work! So I then called the front desk to call security to come and bring new keys. I waited in front of my room for about 20 minutes, crying from frustration. Once security came up, they let me into my room. But wait, there's more! Upon walking into my room, it wasn't house cleaned! All of the bed covers were thrown on a chair in the corner of the room. I called guest services who said they could send house cleaning up but it would take about 45 minutes. Keep in mind that it was 2:40am and I had an early flight. I requested a new room and the guest services lady told me she could switch me rooms but not until 10\/11 am and there was nothing else she could do. She advised me that I would need to speak to the front desk manager and proceeded to transfer me. I waited on hold for 7 minutes only to be notified that the manager was busy dealing with other guests' issues and would call me back. I have yet to receive a call. Oh and wait there is still more! The bathroom had no towels, no shampoo or conditioner, open soap, no flamingo stickers on the toilet paper, and the drain cover was not on the drain. The inside of the door has masking tape around it. Will update review once I speak to someone. In the mean time, I'm being very careful not to touch anything or sit on anything. Basically my room is still under construction. UPDATE: spent 45 minutes downstairs waiting to speak to a manager. Teresa Bradford finally made it out to the front to help me out and was rude, condescending, obtuse, demeaning, and was of no help. I requested a different room and Teresa said there was nothing she could do because it was too late. She then called me a liar and said that I had told house keeping that I approved the room as being ""satisfactory."" I informed Teresa that this was untrue because we had just left the room when house keeping showed up. Teresa continued with her attitude and stated that she would have the house keeping manager meet me at the room to ensure that I was satisfied with the room. She also then demanded that when I upon arrival to the room, that I have the house keeping manager call her to ensure that the room was clean - basically to make sure that I wasn't lying about the room being cleaned. I checked in at 1 am and it is now 4 am and my room is still being cleaned. Claudia, the house keeping manager and Marcela, the house keeper were the only helpful people in the entire hotel.",1,0,0

But the parking. OH GOD, THE PARKING. 

The self-parking carpark is multi-level but the first three levels are for valet only. Every time I try to park after 11pm, I have trouble finding a lot. The carpark is dark and narrow and full of blind spots.

Our room was on the 16th floor- FV. 

I was extremely relieved and pleased.  The room was updated, clean and very nice. I was pretty nervous after reading several reviews but there were zero cleanliness   issues.  The bathroom was very little and that was the  only room complaint.  Barely enough room for one person in the bathroom. 

Zero issues with the elevators to our floor. Easy to get an elevator and they were fast. 

So far from my experience this place has gotten a bad rap from the previous reviews.  But I guess everyones experience is different. 

There is a small food court in the lobby with 4 places to chose from including   a Johnny Rockets (serving breakfast all night until 6 am they close and re-open at 10 am). The LA Subs has tasty sandwiches.  Plenty of bars in the casino everywhere you turn.  Carlos n Charlie's is also inside, they have an outdoor patio too.  It's next to the sports & racing betting room. 

Hotel has a great location on the strip too. Easy walk to mirage, Paris Bally's and Venetian.  Monorail access is around the back.   

The pool was closed for the season but we walked it and could see it's a nice size with several  slides and plenty of open water to relax. 

They have a fitness center located inside the hotel spa (lobby level).   They have 7 treadmills 4 elliptical's  4 bikes. Exercise balls, mats, free weights, and plenty of  weight machines.  Access to the fitness center for 2 people per room is Included in the resort fee. They provide towels and water.  But if you want access to the Spa, shower and locker rooms it's an additional $10. They are Open from 7-6pm 


The habitat is beautiful. Definitely check this place out the flamingos are beautiful, look healthy and the grounds are very well maintained.  In addition to the flamingos There are awesome waterfalls, pelicans, ducks, huge koi fish and even a turtle.  It's free to view so go see it even if you don't stay here.   


There is  a station set up for massages.  2 masseuse are available to serve until midnight.  No appointment, first come first serve.  They have a menu for chair massages,  as little as five minutes for $10 up to 30 mins. Neck & shoulders, neck & back, feet  and several other options and price points. Took advantage of the neck shoulder and back massage. It was wonderful.  You are in the middle of a crowded hotel\/casino lobby but I was so relaxed it didn't matter.   


Check out was a breeze. We had an early flight (like 6 am early) so basically checked  out the night before.  Paid the bill and just left key cards in the room that next morning.   Zero wait for a taxi at 4:45 am  and the hotel valet workers were bright, alert, peppy and ready to help.

- Centrally located on the strip
- The flamingo habitat is neat and they offer daily feeding ""shows"" for free 
- Clean rooms
- Price, the Flamingo is one of the cheaper hotels on the strip, which is great if you're trying to save money

The bad:
- Rooms are dated and lack many amenities I would expect in a hotel (i.e. a mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker, etc.)
- Common areas are trashy. Ripped off floor number plaques, graffiti in the elevators, torn up walls etc. 
- Price, being one of the cheaper hotels on the strip tends to attract a certain crowd. Be prepared to deal with a ton of drunk college kids and rednecks. 
- Timeshare hawkers, these people are stationed right outside the elevator banks and bombard you with a sales pitch EVERYTIME you try to go to your room. 
- The buffet was mediocre at best. Chefs were rude and a lot of the ""warm"" food was cold, their mimosas were weak, and their options limited. Their desserts were good, but not $21.99 good. 
-Late checkout is $60 dollars (due to the price we made sure to check out on time).",5,1,0

I am a plus model and came to LV to do a couple of photo shoots for designers. I have stayed in the time shares at the flamingo and thought that the hotel would be just as lovely. But I was wrong. The room was outdated. With minimal furnishings and wood headboards. There was no coffee makers. Which you at least get at a motel 6. The room was flawed in so many ways. Next the hotel pool closed at 6? Crazy. Especially for a hotel that is known for their pool. I requested information on getting a cabana and never heard back from anyone. And it took us an hour to check out because of the overlap with people checking in and out and they were not properly staffed. I am just very disappointed in what I seen. Especially things being so different from pictures. I come to Vegas often for business and pleasure and i just can't see returning to this hotel. So with that I give my one star. Thank you,1,0,0

This is a great place to stay for the price. This is actually the only place I have stayed in my few times to Vegas. I keep coming back because I am a fan of the location, price, and service. I have to admit, I was a little nervous to return after seeing all of the bad reviews, but here is my most recent experience: 
First off, I never experienced ANY issues with the elevator. There are 3 sets of elevators at the flamingo, the Habitat Elevators, the Spa elevators and the Lobby elevators. Because of the location of our room, we always used the Lobby elevators and never had an issue at all with them. The most we waited was maybe one minute. I saw someone else's review, and they mentioned the elevator line being long at the spa elevators, I didn't experience this, but I also used the Lobby elevators so keep that in mind. 
Next, our room. It was great! When we walked in, the first thing we noticed was that it smelled clean, so we were happy with that. Also, we had a view of the strip and Bellagio fountains from our room, and we just had a standard room, and didn't even pay extra for the view. So, that being said we were happy. I asked the guy that checked us in how the view was from our room, and we had the choice of a room on the 24th floor with no view, or 9th with a view. We chose the 9th and were so happy with it. 
There were a couple things worth mentioning. The bathroom is small. Not really the flamingo's fault, but for two women to try and get ready in, it did not work that well. Also, there were some obvious signs of aging. But, hey its the flamingo! The door was dirty, like it had shoe marks on it. There was a black hand print on the ceiling over my bed (super odd), and the bath tub could have used a good scrub down, as there was some residue in the cracks of the tub. 
All in all though, we were super happy with our room, and our stay. 
Also, I think our neighbor ordered a prostitute. She knocked on the door and they introduced themselves at the door, and she was dressed like one would expect. I could be completely wrong, and miss judging, but that is what it seemed like since the two didn't know each other prior. Again, this is no fault of the flamingo. 
Also, another hint, check in time is 4pm. They charge you an early check in fee of $30 if you check in before 1pm. So, if you wait until AFTER 1, but still before 4, you wont be charged the fee. I think we checked in at 2:15? I can't remember, but I do know it was before 2:30 :) 

I traveled with my mom who is a hotel snob (her favorite is the venetian), so that opened my eyes up to the attention to detail aspect of this hotel so that is why only 4 stars as opposed to my previous 5. But, let me just say, I still LOVE the Flamingo, would still recommend it to anyone traveling to Vegas, and WILL be back.",2,0,0

We booked to night at the Flamingo and arrived around 4pm which is their standard check in time.  I parked in their garage and unloaded all our bags to go check in.  When I arrived I found out they didn't have a room for us.  So the moved our reservation to the Harrahs, which was no big deal, had they at least called and informed us before I waisted my time unloading, reloading, and unloading the car.  

It did make it all better when we got to the Harrahs and found out we were upgraded to a suite at no extra charge.

This hotel deserves zero stars! One our first day our hotel key is not working only hours after checking in. I spend 30 minutes on the phone with the front desk and security,  while my boyfriend  waits in a long line in the lobby to speak with someone in customer service. Over 30 minutes later, somehow we were accidently checked out of the hotel. How are you accidentally checked out of your hotel room?!?! After this outrageous blunder you would think nothing else could go wrong. WRONG!!! The lovely people at Flamingo charge my credit card twice for 1 room, not only did they me twice the second charge was at much higher rate. So here we are again me and my boyfriend waiting in another 30 plus minute line at customer service to get issue resolved. The people at the front desk were completely lost and had no idea what was going on and tried to convince me the extra charges were just resort fees. Right, resort fees that cost more than the actual room?!?! 

Our room was completely outdated. The house keepers do not clean the rooms!!! They literally only made our bed and put fresh towels in the room NOTHING ELSE WAS TOUCH!!! Over half of the elevators did not work!!! So we have to wait and wait and wait before we were able to go up to our because they always was a crowd waiting for the few working elevators. The working elevators were not in great condition at all missing buttons on the control panel, malfunctioning doors, very scary needless to say. Stay away from the benches in the valet area unless you want to be attacked my multiple cockroaches. The valet was so unorganized and always backed up. We were stucked in the valet waiting line for over 15 minutes because unparked cars and people wanting for their luggage. 

Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this place!!! Needless to say this was the worst experience I ever had at any hotel. Our Vegas vacation turned into a Vegas nigthmare. We checked out today, and will never return to the Flamingo!!!",5,2,0

I upgraded for 30 extra each night and it was totally worth it the room was nice the bathroom was nice and everything came out great!!

Overall I totally recommend the flamingo and for sure upgrade if you can its so worth it. The customer service was amazing towards me and the cleaning service was amazing as well very trust worthy.

I was here October 10-14 for kickball - it was our big tournament weekend. The Flamingo was our designated hotel, so imagine kickballers from all over the US packed in one hotel (think shit show). I got my own room because my friends' room was already packed, but I didn't mind since we got a pretty good deal. I got there Friday morning (right after the big Yelp OC party) at around 4 in the morning, but I wasn't able to check in til around 11am. My friend let me stay in her room that night since our other friends weren't coming til late Friday afternoon. The guy we talked to when we got there at guest services was awesome - he made it possible so that my room was directly across from my friends and got me early check-in, in addition to letting my friend have a key to my room in case I got locked out. 

When I got to my room the next morning, I was really surprised with how big it was. I guess it was one of those mini suites. I had a nice view of the pool\/flamingo area, hardwood floors, a king sized bed (you can bet I took up the whole bed by sleeping at an angle), nice sized bathroom, as well as a little couch.

I didn't really take advantage of anything else in this place. I had a staff meeting in the conference room downstairs so I didn't get the chance to go to the pool with all the other kickballers, but from what I saw from the pictures, the pool area was really nice. They had cheap tables and lots of different kinds of slots machine downstairs as well. I liked that the hotel was really close to all the parties we went to that weekend. It's on the strip and pretty much in the middle. The only downside really was all the construction going on. It took us about 30 minutes to figure out where the valet was and it also took a while for valet to get our stuff when we left Monday morning. Overall, this place is pretty sweet for the price I paid. I would definitely get my own room again next year if this is the sponsor hotel for our tournament.",4,0,0

I've had several great stays here in years past but the hotel needs a lot of work! Most of the elevators don't even work and the ones that do stop at almost every floor for no reason. The hallways in standard rooms section are in very poor shape.

The standard rooms lack any sort of ambience and the bathrooms are old and dingy. The upgraded rooms are obviously better but the hotel has a 3.5 star rating at booking sites which is grossly misrepresented. They offered an upgraded room for $20 at check in but felt a 3.5* room should be sufficient. Boy, we we wrong! If you have to stay here, go with an upgraded room unless you have very low Vegas standards. $22 floor the resort fee but wifi doesn't even work!

For the most part, Flamingo hotel served its purpose: a room with five walls and two beds. Other than that, the experience was a nightmare! Before I tell you how there was an intruder who broke into our room at 2am while we were sleeping, let me tell you how dated this hotel is. First, don't go Fab. There is a reason why they say Fab and not Fabulous: they short you on anything that could be great. The rooms were clean but have major wear and tear for something that was recently ""updated"". The non-smoking room linoleum floors had burn marks (Hmmmm, burn marks in a non-smoking room...ok). The bathrooms were clearly not ""updated"". It looks like they still have the original bath from back in the day. They clearly have the same ancient plumbing, as on the second day there we had NO HOT WATER! I called front desk to inquire about my ice cold frozen shower and was told they had to shut off the hot water to fix a leaky pipe. Really? On a Saturday morning you are going to fix a leaky pipe? I can understand between off hours of maybe 3-6am but at 10am and with NO notice? They were so gracious enough (insert eye roll) to deduct one day resort fee. ONE RESORT FEE $30 for a day without hot water? A day where I am paying over $100+ just to stay in this ""updated"" room? Fast forward to this morning. Two of us had an early flight so we called it an early night. Imagine, sleeping in bed, in a far from Fab room, and be awoken by a strange man. This lazy, good for nothing, can't get a damn job and work for their own crap, poor excuse of a boy was in our room apparently going through purses. Wtf? If it wasn't for the quick action of a girl in the room, this mofo might have done more damage than taking a credit card, bank card, and cash from a wallet. Mind you, in the SAME hallway, a family caught this mofo's accomplice in their bathroom! They had it far worse than us. Their computer, phone, credit cards, and money were all taken. The security people there were phenomenal. They responded quickly and apprehended one of the two suspects. They were very supportive through out this ordeal. Unfortunately, the same could NOT be said of the front desk manager. I asked to speak with the manager as we felt violated. How can someone come into a hotel room in the middle of the night? I asked to get refunded our entire stay. The front desk said she would get the manager to come and speak to us. Mr. (Could be Ms. with the no balls\/cajones the way (s)he handled this) Shaun Lawson is a very poor excuse for a manager! How he got this far in life amazes me. He told the front desk lady that there is nothing he can do until the investigation is complete. Mind you, I get it and understand if you could not give me a refund on the time spent there but at least come and talk to me as a manAGER who should be concerned this happened under your watch. He even had the nerve to walk by me and not even acknowledge me standing there. A manager should NEVER do this to a customer after such a traumatizing experience. You as a manager should be the one to talk to me, be the one to tell me what you can and cannot do. This boy had the nerve to pass this on to his staff. This is not something staff should handle - manager skill 101. They need to train you first to be a manager and second to be a man. I will never stay in this motel again. Oh and to add even more insult to this. They had the nerve to ask what reward level I was. What the hell did my reward level have to do with any of this? How dare you use my reward level as a factor in how you will solve this incident. If I was a platinum vs. a gold would I receive different outcome from this situation?

It was our first time in Las Vegas, and my boyfriend and I stayed here for 4 nights. We arrived at about 10:15pm on a Monday night, and WOW, the check-in line was long. 

When we finally got to the desk, we were informed that there weren't any non-smoking rooms with king-sized beds available unless we were willing to have just a shower instead of a shower\/tub combo. We agreed, not realizing until we got up to the room that this meant the room was a handicapped-accessible room...and that the ""shower"" was just part of the bathroom enclosed with a curtain and a low-hanging showerhead. Sigh. 

We dealt with this tiny snafu and went down the next morning to see about changing rooms. Again, the check-in line was a mile long so we decided to try again later since we both had appointments at the spa. We got the spring fling special: a 25-min body scrub, a 25-min facial, and a 25-min massage for $150. Worth every penny. 

After our visit to the spa, my boyfriend stopped by the front desk at about 1:20pm to see about changing rooms and was informed that they only do room changes between 11am and 1pm. Oh, and that you can do it over the phone so you don't have to wait in line! Good to know. We stuck it out another night and called the next morning and got a new room on the 20th floor. At this point I noticed that some of the rooms on this floor looked really, really cool....much cooler than our room, at least. I assume that these are the GO rooms that I read so much about -- next time I will have to spring for one of those!

The pool was fantastically large, and the hot tubs were great, but be forewarned that ordering a large drink to enjoy poolside will set you back $18.

Not much good food or entertainment inside the hotel, we ended up going elsewhere a lot, but that wasn't so bad because the Flamingo is very centrally located.

Originally we we're staying at the Venetian (hands down the best high secured hotel on the strip) however, last minute bookings we missed out on a room big enough for 5 people. Fight weekend lots of hotels booked.
Driving up you could already tell it is OLD. Walking in same feeling. Walking through to get to our building ( the habitat tower) I didn't expect anything but slots machines and gambling tables. Duh it's Vegas. The habitat tower has not been renovated! The carpets in the halls were stained and looked like that have never been changed. Our room a two queen bed room had out dated lamps (never been dusted) literally took my finger and wiped off dust from the bottom of the lamp. Our view was horrible overlooking the resorts mechanical things (not sure what's it called). The beds had no comforters just some ugly fur thing big enough to cover your feet. The bathroom was the worst. Shower curtain too long for the shower rail many times got wet! The toilet and vanity were so old that the paint on the vanity looked like someone was sanding it and forgot to repaint it.
The restaurant that serves breakfast their staff were rude and not very nice. Maybe it was too early in the morning and who knows what ass hole pist them off before we got seated but other then food being very yummy and satisfying that's all I have to say about that.
The pool gets crowded quickly! Great dj and fun atmosphere. Bartenders hook you up if you hook them up with a GREAT tip! Don't be cheap people. However, for my friends and I this past weekend was one that we will never forget. While in the pool we noticed a male turned over in the pool like if he was playing dead. After a few minutes some of the swimmers near him noticed he wasn't playing dead. He basically drowned and my friend had along with about 5 other guys help push him out of the water into the deck. Lifeguards and no clue what to do. Some other girl began to give him CPR. The man came back and began to have what seems to have been a seizure. I jumped in since I'm CPR\/first aid certified to grab his tongue and no one would listen to me. He bit his tongue badly and bleed all over the pool deck. EMS finally got there after 15 minutes and I think his fine.

The most annoying thing was not the line but the fact that they could not find any of the reservations we made, there were 4 rooms booked in total under our name.  
    Finally after much trouble my Fiance found the conformation number in an email on his phone. After showing it to the attendant at the desk she slowly entered our info and passed over our keys. What I do not understand is how our info was so messed up when we made our reservations through their website, all rooms were assigned by us to our guests and their info was typed by us. The attendant botched all the names and rearranged it so that a few of our guests last names had been switched with others. How stupid do you have to be to not listen and have us repeat everything three or more times. We also specifically booked non smoking rooms but were informed that they had none available. How is that possible? 
   After finally settling at the counter we made our way to the bank of elevators that she had directed us to in the lobby and up 23 floors. After a dizzying walk around we finally found a random security guard who informed us we had been directed to the wrong elevators. Seriously? How can you mess up directions to a place you work for? 
      When we arrived at our suite, we were delighted at the style and furnishings, and an impeccable view to boot. These attributes and the go pool are this hotels only saving graces. More on the pool later. 
      Everyone else seemed to be happy with their rooms too, except for one of our asthmatic friends who could not tolerate the smell of smoke that permeated from every inch of their room. I was also very upset that the four rooms we booked were on completely different sides and floors of the hotel. We were there to celebrate a wedding and wanted our friends to be close. 
     Anyhow, on our first morning at the hotel we were rudely walked in on by the cleaning staff despite the fact that we not only had the do not disturb sign provided by the hotel but one I made for all our guests and us for our wedding. 
      Our Second morning started the same way. We decided to go hang by the pool and let me just say this was one of the best pools I had been to in awhile. Also one of the reasons why we decided to stay there, it was voted one of the best pools in Vegas. The pool did open 15 minutes late and they started kicking everyone out 15 minutes before they closed. A half hour of swim time is a lot to miss out on, especially in the heat that is Vegas. After leaving the pool, EARLY, we went to our room and ordered room service. We ordered a cobb salad and a plain cheese quesadilla. It took and hour and forty five minutes to be delivered, they said they always get flooded with orders when the pool closes. If they know that little tidbit of info, don't you think you should put more staff on at that time. We could have gone out to eat and been back to the hotel before our food came. 
    At this point we were so disenchanted that we pretty much stayed away from the hotel until we were too exhausted to stand and needed to sleep and prep to go back out. We went to the Aria and it was awesome, decided next time that is the hotel to stay at. Even the employees were happy and helpful. The flamingo employees were angry, terse, and pretty much seemed liked they hated everything and everyone. 
     We asked for a late check out, considering we just got married we thought this would not be an issue, plus we offered to pay. They rudely informed us that we could not due to being fully booked. I was curious so while we went to breakfast I got on my phone and searched for available rooms. The interwebs said they had plenty of rooms left. So someone was lying, I wanted an hour max, not another day, I had just been married for F's sake!  
   Since we couldn't check out later we made the decision to leave our bags with the bellhop service while we went to eat some breakfast before the long drive back to LA. The bellhop was so cold and short. It was like he was doing us a favor instead of doing his job that he was getting paid to do. I understand everyone has bad days, but keep that shit to yourself, especially when you're at work. 
     When we went to pick up our luggage and load it in the car we were faced with a long line due to the disorganization that obviously runs rampant at this hotel. What is management doing while their employees are giving such terrible service to paying customers? If I wasn't on the high of being deliriously happy due to just being married this experience would have ruined my vacation completely. I will never give my hard earned money to this hotel EVER AGAIN!!!!

Expectations were not high considering how cheap we got the room for, but gosh did they let us down even more. The hotel smelled like coconut milk, which wasn't appealing to our group. I guess they were trying to work with the tropical theme? Uh huh. We showered in cold water for most of our stay at the hotel. We called the staff to have someone come by and fix it. A man came by to ""fix"" it. We tried the water again- still COLD. We then complained to the front desk, who was quite courteous. The front desk woman gave us a change of room and $30 to use for room service (enough for 2 measly breakfast orders for the four of us). The first round of showers in the new room finally had warm water, but that's it. All the showers after that ranged from very slightly warm to coolly cold. Maybe we had bad luck. Maybe the water system was understandably affected by some outside force. Either way, I ain't gonna step into this coconut milk-smelling hotel again.",4,1,0

The vacation was for my birthday and it was also my first time going to Las Vegas. So we were hoping to have a good time. We checked in, with no problems. We came to this hotel with the information on their site that it was in fantastic shape and at a great price. My review of this hotel is as follows:

We were directed to the Habitat Elevators, upon stepping into the elevators, we noticed it was quite dirty and nasty, hand rails were missing, paint was chipped and missing, along with gang symbols scratched into the walls. We got up to our floor and as we walked down the never ending hall we noticed the carpet was pulled up and completely messed up. We walked past the ice machine next to our room that didn't work and had cigarette butts in it, there was a giant hole in the wall right next to it. 

We get into our room and turn the lights on. Everything looks good walking in. I lay down on the bed and automatically I have springs sticking into my back on one side of the bed and the other side of the bed was just fine. One of the pillows had stains on it and there was some mold on the pillow case. I immediately tossed that pillow on that floor. There were stains on the sheets. Removed those. The drawers in the dresser barely worked. 

I walked into the bathroom and noticed quite a few nasty things. There was a vent in the shower that was caked with dirt, dust, and mold. There was a hole in the ceiling above the shower the size of a golf ball, that was filled with dirt, dust, and mold. There was rust on a door above the shower. The shower curtain was stained at the bottom. There was dirt, dust, and mold on the crowning above the sink.

We went downstairs to the front desk, we informed the lady of what was going on. She honestly could care less, like she was expecting us to have complaints and was ready with ""Sorry to hear about that."", ""What would you like me to do about it?"", and ""Sorry we are booked full for the night and tomorrow night, you can try for Sunday night."" I informed here that we are really disappointed and again she didn't care. I asked for a manger, and there wasn't one available, she simply stated that she will put it in the notes for my room. So I kept my cool and we hit the strip.

July 26th, my girlfriend and I walked the stripped and had a blast, we walked in the hotel and asked to speak with a manager. While waiting I looked around and saw a broken beer bottle with beer all over the floor in the check-in line. I finally got to speak with one, I told him what we had going on and the treatment we got from the night staff, he apologized, but it sounded just like the standard script that is practiced when you have to deal with an unhappy customer. So to make me feel better, he gave me a $30 food voucher and took $20 dollars off my room bill, and said he would have someone come up to address the dirt and mold. We went back to the room, to prepare for our first event of the night. When we walked in, the pillow case that I had removed off the dirty pillow was still in the room, draped over the chair. Room service didn't bother to hang any of the towels, they just left them in a pile on the sink. There were still stained sheets on the bed. And room service didn't replace any of the soaps or shampoos when they cleaned. So we called down to the front desk, told them we need toiletries asap please. Nothing came before we left, and nobody came to clean the dirt and dust. 

We come back from our show and decided to eat, we opted for the Tropical Breeze Cafe . The menu didn't look great, but the special did. So it took a while for our waiter to come over, he was busy trying to pick up on the older woman sitting behind our booth. When he did he introduced himself as Jairo. He could barely understand English, I got passed this and explained to him what I wanted. Apparently it was too difficult for him to understand that I wanted both Coleslaw and Fries with my order. He took my girlfriends order and he disappeared. He brought out our food about 10 minutes later. He had gotten my order wrong, but I wasn't going to fight it. I only got the coleslaw. I took a bite of the slaw and it was spoiled. I ate the rest of my food in silence. He never came back to check on us, just gave us eye contact and walked on by. We finally had to flag down a member of the bus staff to get our check. We utilized our $30 credit and left.

We got back up to the room, room service stopped by again, and left a trash bag full of soaps, lotions, shampoos, conditioner, toilet paper, and tissue boxes in our sink. The dirt, dust, and mold were still there. We slept for a bit, got up and left for our next show. Came back and slept.

Checkout was 11AM. Housekeeping was knocking on our door by 1030. Was never so happy to get out of there.",0,0,0

Those are the only positives I can think of after just spending 3 days here. The main reason we stayed here is because we heard great things about the pool but we had to wait in a HUGE line and we ended up walking away. I can't believe hotel guests don't get a different line to stand in. Instead, we have to wait with people who paid to stay in other hotels but want to go to this pool. Well, i guess those people are smart. Next time, we'll stay at a different hotel and just come over to this pool since you don't get any kind of special treatment for being a guest. 

We got early check in for an extra $30 which was great and they said it's a handicapped room with a walk in shower. Awesome right? Hell no. Don't ever agree to that room if you're not handicapped. The shower head wasn't attached to the wall and I took a shower that completely flooded the bathroom. I had to use all of my towels to clean it up. There aren't even coffee makers in the room!

He stopped at the front desk before his meeting, with luggage in tow so it didn't get infested.

Pros: I must say the staff was entirely gracious during our visit; they really do a great job of attending to your wishes. Comfy beds and pillows. Large shower and tub. Plush towels. Maids did a great job of cleaning each day and were very friendly. Please remember to tip your maid each day; they work hard.

Cons: very smokey casino in need of better air exchange system; it just stinks. Very strange furnishings in rooms; not what I would call tasteful. Headboard is some tacky plastic button-type thing. Nine recessed lightbulbs above the bed - so weird. Bathroom door is just a sliding frosted glass, not much privacy there and let's a lot of light through when a person is using it. TV in the bathroom mirror = just silly, imo. Dirty carpeting by elevators and hallways. Lock didn't work on the room safe. Needs overall updating. Not classy. Have to pay for Wifi each day.

Breakfast buffet:  average, and rather slow service.

We arrived at the hotel around 5pm. The check-in process was extremely slow since there weren't enough employees working. It took a total of maybe 3 minutes from the time I gave her my I.D to getting my room key. 

Our room is located in the Habitat tower. Our room was located all the way at the end of the hallway. 

As for the room itself, it looks simple and modern. I love the hardwood floor. This is my first time staying in a hotel room with a hardwood floor. I love that they use hardwood floor instead of carpet.

I had an opportunity to swim at the GO pool and recorded a full tour of how the GO Pool looks like. So if you guys want to see how the pool looks like click on my video below:   http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NbYqrzkfSjQ

Not as good as home but damn decent.
Downsides include the noise. Noise from the street isn't terrible but it is audible. Until the air conditioning unit kicks in, then that noisy bugger is what you hear.
While we're talking about the air conditioner: it drips water. I'm going to assume it's like the compressor on your vehicle dripping condensation... or else I'm going be really grossed out by what dripped on me.

We stayed from Saturday-Tuesday in a GO deluxe room. I would recommend one of these rooms, as they are spacious and very nice. We got ours for the same price as the regular rooms through Expedia.

Honestly, there was nothing bad about this place because we weren't here to spend our time in the hotel room. Our experience, however, was totally fine and even (by my picky standards) good: The rooms were clean and spacious, the air worked well, and the bathroom was clean. 

We arrived in Vegas around 10 a.m. and checked in early. We couldn't get into the room until 3 p.m. or so. They let us check our luggage in some back room and gave us 4 passes the pool. We changed in the bathroom on the lobby floor and went out the pool. They only gave us 4 passes since it was technically a 4 person room, but we had no trouble bringing an extra person in. They only check IDs--they don't even check the passes. We bought drinks (expensive, but we expected that) and lounged all day. It was great!

We didn't experience any poor customer service and we didn't have any complaints. The location was perfect. We went to clubs at the Cosmopolitan and Bellagio and they were very close. 

The best part about this place was the adult pool. SO fun. Honestly, that made the trip. A lot of club promoters were at the pool, and they were walking around and putting people on lists. DO THIS! You will gain express entry and even free cover. This was amazing and totally made our trip worth it!

This place is cheap and in an amazing location.

I've spent enough time in the other casinos in the area to know that it's worse here than other places, and it's not just in the lobby and in the casino. Even though smoking isn't supposed to be allowed in rooms, ours reeked. People were smoking in the elevators. Everything is a bit dingy and outdated. One of our towels had a stain on it, as did the bedspread. The internet barely worked, despite the fact that we were paying a ton for it.

Check-in is a nightmare...endless lines and inadequate staffing. 

Unless you pony up the resort rate, plan on spending $10\/day to access the gym.

Of those 3 people, only two were checking-in regular customers. The third person was only taking 'Elite customers'. While I was in line, I didn't see a single Elite customers check-in. Please, a customer is a customer. Use your discretion when necessary. About 20+ people were waiting to check-in.  

I got a decent room. It had basic amenities: tv, desk, bed, couch, iron\/ironing board, hair dryer, and toiletries. No tea\/coffee or a coffee maker. I asked for a non-smoking room. I walked into the room and the room smelled smokey. One call to the front desk, they sent someone with access cards to a different room. We got a nice room with a view of the pool area. Wifi is not included, so get ready to pay $13\/day for it. I tried the food court and it had some limited choices. The bell desk held my baggage for free. At checkout don't forget to ask for the air port shuttle. It's only $7 and comes by every 20 minutes (runs until midnight). Overall, I got what I paid for. No complaints!

Our room was very far from the elevators which we thought would be good.  Not so much.  We had large groups of people staying near us that were up all night moving from room to room.

Our room was ok, nothing special and not one I would care to stay in again.   If you are in your room when the pool is open, the music shakes your window and you can hear it clearly.

Gotta disagree, although this place could use a few improvements in certain areas. Yet considering this hotel's location, price point and amenities, there is one word that I can describe it by: convenient. 

First off, location. 10 minutes (if that) from McCarran airport, adjacent to Westin Las Vegas and across the street from The Linq hotel, Caesar's Palace & The Bellagio, as well as the High Roller Ferris wheel. It does not get any better than this when it comes to accessing these Vegas Strip staples on foot. 

Second, the room. Honestly, the room was a bit spartan and plain for my tastes, yet it was somewhat spacious for a property that has over 3,600 rooms on 28 floors. Internet is not free here, yet that was expected (check your resort fees). During my 4-night stay here, the elevators on the wing that has the Paradise Garden Buffet worked infrequently. Half of them seemed to be broken, so expect a wait either prior to entering or during your elevator ride. It will seem as if you are going to every single floor. 

Third, valet, baggage claim, and check-in. I actually thought that the first two were remarkably easy, while the check-in process has challenges. I and my wife (yes, some of us bring our wives to Vegas) waited about 10 minutes between the hour of 8:30 and 9 PM, yet some others were not so lucky. There appears to be 7-8 front desk agents at a time during peak hours. For those checking in or out between 11 AM and 3 PM, expect a line that will go all the way past the box office. This is not an exaggeration (see my photos). Highly recommended to do the express check-in\/check-out or via Internet. 

Fourth, restaurant + amenities. The Flamingo has the Paradise Garden Buffet, which is one of the best in town. Its not the Rio, yet its good. Prices range from $17.99-21.99 per person, depending on if you have a Player's Card (get one at the both across from the front desk), active duty military, senior citizen, etc. The Pizza Joint, + mexican restaurant have reasonable prices. Yet if you want even better food at reasonable prices, you'll have to exit the Flamingo and walk towards where Margaritaville is located (highly recommended). The hotel's resort area has quite a bit of wildlife on it, from Chilean flamingos to ducks, geese, turtles, and exotic birds. While in season, there are at least 4-5 pools here.

Fifth, the casino itself. What can I say, its a casino. The casino employees are remarkably nice (even the dealers that took cash from me), and the machines are in good repair. There is a good security presence here, and I never felt threatened despite the weirdness of some Vegas patrons. For those that aren't used to it, expect someone smoking a pipe, vape, nasty cigarette w\/o filter or even a joint in almost all areas of the floor. Drink prices tend to have that standard 25-30% markup. Also, the permanent show seems to be Donnie & Marie Osmond, for all of you Baby-Boomers out there. 

Overall, the Flamingo met my needs while here on a conference. While it may have been annoying to get offered a time share property at every opportunity that I walked down the hallway (as well as riding the perpetually slow & broken elevators), the property yielded a very good Vegas experience.",19,9,11

Just wanted a place to sleep and a place to leave our luggage. I wanted somewhere on the strip and this was the cheapest. I had a really great experience! The check in line was ASTRONOMICAL, would have taken 40+ minutes, but the kiosks you can use to check in took me literally 2 minutes. That was a huge help! Our room had a view of a random garage but we opted out of the extra charge for a strip view so can't complain! The beds were comfy, the room was clean, that's all we needed! 

When we went to check out I saw the line, again- astronomically long! BUT again you could check out using the kiosks OR with your cell phone via an email they sent. I used my cell phone and checked out during a nice relaxing breakfast at a nearby brunch restaurant. I didn't need to speak to any concierge or anyone because again, we're low maintenance and didn't need anything from them. I can only speak to that and if you have requests then maybe the experience would unfortunately be like other reviewers, but for us it was great!

The Flamingo water slide pool gets 4 stars and Donny and Marie get 5 stars (even though I am not a D&M fan, the show was very entertaining and well worth it).

Otherwise, we would have stayed at the Wynn or Encore because, for roughly the same price, the Wynn gives you a much newer, cleaner, nicer room and hotel.  The Wynn has a big pool, but no water slide like the Flamingo.

But the Flamingo hotel and rooms get 2 stars.  The Flamingo felt white trashy.   We stayed in a GO room with a view, which is supposed to be a renovated upgrade from their standard rooms.  The hall way carpet was covered in stains.  The bathroom smelled and the sink was clogged when we arrived.  There are no tubs.  Just a shower stall.  The shower is supposed to have jets but if you use the jets the entire bathroom floor gets major flooding because of the lame lame shower design.  The bathroom also has a weird sliding glass door that is see-through, sound-through, and smell-through.    There was a flat screen TV.  The hotel guide in the room is insufficient and does not give you a map or directions or hours to get to any of the stuff in the hotel.  If you try and call the front desk, it is just like trying to call a 1-800 customer service line. There was a small fridge in the room.  The beds were comfy enough but bedding (and ceiling - this is Vegas) had hot pink stains all over it.  Internet access was like $15\/day and did not appear to be wireless.  Checking in or out is like waiting at the airport luggage line.  

The buffet has okay but nothing better than a Chuck-O-Rama really.  The cafe, was good, but served the exact same food for the exact same prices as in-room service.  

The pool was good.  What used to be the 18+ pool (a boring oval surrounded by statutes) has been changed to the family pool.  Now, half of what used to be the family pool complex (including the largest open part with the water fall) is closed to children under 18.  Starting at 10 AM, they open up the half of the water slide complex that kids can use, which has the big slide.  

Until they do a serious renovation, we will not return to the Flamingo because the hotel\/rooms are too nasty.  There are Hilton villas or something adjacent to the complex that get use of the Flamingo pool.  I might try and stay there next time because the rooms look to have what we want:  newer furnishings\/decor with a good jetted tub.",0,0,0

Cold showers AND after 4 phone calls to housekeeping our room still did not get cleaned! 

There solution to every problem is a ""food & beverage credit"" (that cannot be used at the only 2 decent eateries in the hotel).

After deciding to go to Flamingo's Paradise Garden Buffet, I just had to figure out where the heck it is. I know...I know...its on Flamingo Road, but I just don't know what the design of the building looks like since Aria, Caesars Palace have distinctive designs. How old is Flamingo? 

I had trouble finding the parking lot many times. I circled the building twice and entered Imperial Palace's parking garage by accident and got stuck in it. I finally found the garage, but I was so lost where the elevators were. POOR SIGNAGE!!! I made a mistake and accidentally found a sweet spot near the elevator. The parking garage is not connected to the casino, so you will have to cross the driveway where the cabs are waiting. My mom thought she saw a woman from Designing Women waiting for her limo or ride. I think it was a TV show. Oh well, I am not familiar, but I guess you will bump to someone from the past in Vegas.

We walked in and wow...bright and shiny like the casino was brand new. The smell of coffee in the air and all the shiny floors and railings. Looks old on the outside, but definitely cool in the inside. I didn't have my Total Rewards Card, so I headed straight there to get it. Unlike Harrah's Casino, this TR area was small. Only 3 people working on a small booth type area. I got my card and I was in and out fast before the Platinum's got theirs. 

I saw a lot of Filipino workers here. Geez...With Pacquiao's fight, I swear it was a Public Relations ploy to get Pacquiao supporters to stay at Harrah's Brand instead of MGM. On the way to the buffet, I, actually, saw FLAMINGOS!!!! Why didn't I take a picture?! It was weird to see a pink bird just walking around the patio area. Now I am thinking of Suzanne Somers from Three's Company. 

Overall, the casino looks better than Sahara, but the bathroom might need some upgrades since I had trouble trying to get out of the stall...lol. My leg blocked the way out. Parking Garage and accessibility is a little confusing since you have to enter from the back through the alley. Would I return?.....I will say...Yes.

Now on to the room condition!

The bathroom tub and floor were dirty, I didn't want to even walk around barefoot or step foot in that tub.We had a broken phone, broken lamp, dirty shower curtain.

After seeing how dirty the bathroom was and seeing how our lamp and phone both didn't work, we immediately decided we didn't want to spend a night in this place. I immediately went back the front desk to check out. I explained the condition of the room to a different women at the front counter. She too was rude and unaffected and unapologetic and had to go ""see what she could do"" in terms of refunding me my money. Horrible service, filthy rooms.

 I arranged for nail appointments for myself and five additional friends and family members to receive nail services prior to my wedding on December 17, 2011. I made this arrangement through Dallas Holmes with Total Experiences  at Caesar's Palace. He had called to confirm pricing. I wanted to make certain that I could receive a gel manicure so I called the salon ahead of time to confirm availability as well as pricing. I was told $30 for each mani and $55 for each pedi.  This sounded perfect!  
   On the morning of the 17th I was so excited for our little spa day. We arrived for our appointment, and the young lady at the front desk seemed surprised we were there.  It felt as if things were in disarray from the time we arrived. I was called back first and taken to a side of the salon away from the rest of my party. Feeling isolated was not exactly how I had pictured my day going.  This is where all of our problems truly began...  My technician, Lisa, told me she could not do the Shellac manicure I had hoped for and I could not go to another technician because they were all occupied with the rest of my party. She promised me her manicures would last 10-12 days, just like Shellac, but with more versatility.  I told her regular polish doesnt last on me because i wash my hands so frequently  she informed me she had been doing nails longer than i had been alive and she knew what she was talking about. I agreed. What else was I to do when I had already been told no?  She made me take my jewelry off, including my engagement ring, and leave it in a cup. I voiced my concern with this, but was again brushed off.  I was told my hands looked ""awful"" and ""wrinkly"" and badly needed exfoliated and moisturized. Ummm ok? She rushed me to the back sink where I was instructed to exfoliate my own hands. (Not exactly pampering or relaxing or invigorating like the menu says, as I can do this myself at home anytime.) As I sat down to get ready for my paraffin dip, my technician and the technician doing my mother's pedicure began to bicker and argue over who should be responsible for buying more paraffin wax.  This was quite unprofessional and made the environment extremely awkward. Again, not exactly what I had in mind. My hands were shoved into plastic bags for about three minutes before the wax was removed (I guess pulling the wax off was considered the hand and arm massage? I certainly hope not.) Throughout my entire manicure, all I heard was about how her friend's husband was leaving her because she could not conceive and her best guy friend won't talk to her.  Again, not exactly relaxing. My manicure looked awesome upon completion. I was very pleased. However, my joy wouldn't last long because my pedicure opened a whole new can of worms. My Aunt's blue water was referred to as ""Smurf pee"" and my orange water as ""pee"" by my technician.  Awesome. Just what I want to stick my feet in. Lisa sat down and then announced, ""Let me go rinse these real quick."". To my horror, she rinsed off the metal foot file and cuticle clippers. Rinsed them off!  Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe all non disposable metal supplies are to be sanitized appropriately by an AutoClave or in a solution such as BarberSol. I did not see one single sterile package opened. Not for myself nor any of my party. This is revolting. Lisa proceeded to look at the bottom of my feet and cause a huge, embarrassing scene over the fact that I pull off my calluses. I am not proud of this habit and did not need it being put on display for the entire salon on my wedding day. She began to file away my calluses with this unclean file. I did not even think to protest because I was too busy wanting to crawl under a rock to hide from my embarrassment. Of course she filed too deeply on my right foot and made me bleed. Perfect! A sore foot on my wedding day, just what I needed.  She put this file, with my blood obviously on it, back in her little drawer to be rinsed off for the next customer. I need not even go into the dangers of blood borne pathogens and the high risk of their transmission with improper sanitation. Nobody wants a side of Hepatits or MRSA with their mani\/pedi.

Ok I get that this is an older hotel and I get what I pay for, but they could at least fix what is broken in the rooms. The sliding mirror doors on the closet rooms does not slide and you have to pick it up off the track to move it with the possibility of it falling off the track and falling and breaking it into a million pieces. The room was moist and smelled of mold and smoke. The washrooms were dingy and the sink is cracked. There was no refrigerator in the room and my friend needed the fridge for her insulin so we called down to get a refrigerator. They never showed up when we waited for it. We went out and that night when we returned they had brought the fridge up and plugged it in, but there are no plugs in the room except the washroom, so they plugged the cord in the bathroom which prevented us from closing the bathroom door. WTF??! Seriously. The fridge itself was old and stank. I wanted to cry so bad, but it was only for 4 nights so I decided to endure it rather than waste anymore time trying to move hotels. The elelvators never worked. There are 6 elevators and only 3 of them were in working order, HOWEVER you would wait close to 20 minutes before one even showed up. And if\/when one does show up it will be full and you continue to wait. There was one incident that we decided to take the stairs. The stairwell was like a horror show. We made it to the bottom but it was horrifying. Furthermore 1 out of the three working elevators only stopped one floor at a time. We also ran into an incident where the elevator just stopped at one floor and never moved from it. Another incident when I got off on my floor the garbage can was on fire from someone throwing a lit cigarette into it. I will never stay here again even if the room was free. The only good thing about this hotel is that it is a monorail stop which was very convenient getting to where we needed to go.

The desk guy called a manager and I was given a little bit of an upgrade to an executive Fab luxury room on the 28th floor. We now had couch and refrigerator :) The room was very clean and spacious.

Then, the keycard didn't work and we had to go down to the lobby, wait in line again to get a new card. This happened THREE TIMES.

At first upon walking into the room, the white walls and dim pink light from the bathroom are slightly off putting to the eyes. The white is brightened by a harsh light that is directly over the bed to purposely illuminate the room. As we walked in, everything seemed alright. Nothing quite wowing other than the off putting light in the room that can be rectified once you find the switch to turn off the lights over the bed off and turn on the lamps on the other side of the room that make the room more comfortable. 

The first thing I like to do when I get into my hotel room is start unpacking my bag - put things where they need to be so I can just get ready to enjoy my stay without doing the ""where is this thing?"" run around. While doing this process, I discovered a few things that made me apprehensive about the room. There were dust bunnies everywhere! I am not an insane neat freak, and usually a little dust doesn't kill anybody, but wads of dust in different places of the room has to be unacceptable. It made me a little worried about what other things have been neglected of cleanliness and it took me some time and definitely some booze to get over the question if the bed was actually clean or not. 

I did end up calling the front desk to see if there was possibly a cleaner room available, but apparently they were at capacity and nothing was available. They did accommodate a bit by waving the amenities fee for our first night there and sent up someone to take care of the questionable parts of the room. 

As the maid came in, she asked what needed to be done, and we watched as she cleaned around the top of the tacky light fixture above the bed with what seemed to be a 99$ version of a swifter to collect dust, but I checked once she left and it wasn't quite effective, but I was grateful that she tried. The next step was watching her wipe down with a towel the corners between the beds and the night stand, around the socket in the bathroom, behind the edge of the mirror, around the thermostat, and at that point I figured asking her to wipe the emergency light fixture near the ceiling was a little excessive, but also because her attempt to clean around the thermostat wasn't quite successful. 

Some other nit pick things is that we were in a non-smoking room and for some reason each time we left the room the hallway smelled strongly of cigarette smoke, the TV in the bathroom that is advertised as an amenity didn't work, a couple bulbs needed replacing, and the shower head could use some cleaning so it looked more welcoming.

I have attached with this review photo evidence of what I'm talking about. You might think it's not a big deal, but being someone with allergies and asthma, thick dust doesn't quite create a comfortable stay. Also, knowing that I'm not going to catch anything while being in a room I'm paying for is always a comfort.

The reason I'm giving this location two stars is because the staff was nice and helpful, the room for the most part completed it's task of being a sleep location between being on the strip, and it really is located well on the strip at a decent price - but now I know why the price is so appealing, because the rooms are not quite. 

Overall, unless I'm stuck in a pinch, I will probably try something else on the strip the next time I choose to visit the city of sin.",1,2,0

Turned down the covers to go to bed only to find the sheets were covered in human hair. Not just a couple,  but hundreds.  It's like the hairiest man slept in them the night before and they forgot to change them. They just made the bed.  I took pictures to prove it.  

I called customer services who said they would send someone to change them. After an hour wait, the maid finally showed up.  We watched as she tried out three other sets of sheets but pulled them off when she saw they were also dirty.  Finally she found some that appeared to be clean and finished making the bed.  

After she left we checked the sheets and the did appear to be clean,  although I have my doubts they were. 

Customer service gave us a food credit of $30 for our troubles, but when I checked out I found out the credit was not good for the places we ate. At the time we ate we were told the meal was charged to the room, so we thought we were good to go. What a big suprize to find out we weren't.  So we weren't able to use the credit, and it actually cost us more. 

The room was booked through my company for a convention, otherwise my wife and I  would have left and found a room elsewhere.  I can promise that I will never stay at the flamingo again.  It's a filthy dirty run down mess.  Nothing in the rooms say luxury.  If you don't believe me,  just look at the pictures. If you do decide to stay here,  you've got to check the sheets!",5,0,1

Most of my stays in Vegas have been with the Flamingo and by far this is probably the worst stay ever. Didn't have any problems with the food, rooms or casino, just the staff. They are a bunch of thieves.

My husband was sitting at one of the bars playing video blackjack. For some stupid reason he didn't put his money in his wallet but decided to stuff it in his pocket. Unfortunately he didn't stuff it far enough so the money fell out of his pocket, yup $220 gone. Luckily he remembered who was around him. He remembered an Asian employee coming up to him tryin to start a conversation. Thank god for the security cameras because low and behold they caught the lady kicking the money to the side and her accomplice (another employee) picking it up.

If it wasn't for the quick attention of security and the cameras, we would've been a$$ed out! 

If I can give separate ratings, I would give 4 stars for security, 2 stars for the stay and -10 stars for the staff. The thing that sucked was for our inconvenience and there incompetence, they only gave us a $50 credit to use for food and drink for 8 people (we had 4 rooms total).

We may be a little jaded since we have stayed at some of the nicest places in Vegas, but the Flamingo was a big disappointment. The casino needs better ventilation for all the smoke. The room we initially went to was not clean, so we were ""upgraded"" to a room higher up that was next to the elevator and our view was the back parking lot. The photos online make it look like the entire hotel had  renovation, which I think was just some new paint and a bedspread. The room was still very old. We had to laugh when we saw the shower head (see photo), which was actually a bathtub faucet with a shower head attached to it. Overall, I doubt we would stay here again.",2,3,1

The wife and I stayed here for our 10yr anniversary....but it was not planned really.....let me explain. We have always went to tropical locales over the years for our anniversary......but since we moved to Phoenix from Chicago....and we had already bought each other very expensive anniversary gifts we didn't really know how our funds would look to take one of those ""tropical' trips this year.

So in our search to find somewhere to go it came down to 2 locations....San Diego, CA.....or Las Vegas, NV. Well since both were short drives that didn't help us decide....but what did was the great deal my wife found. We took United Airlines last year when we went to Maui and my wife got a boat load of points for our mileage traveled. While looking up hotels in Vegas she found we could stay at this world famous establishment by using our point\s.....and we could stay for 5 days for only.....wait for it......wait for it.....wait for it....16 BUCKS.....wohoooo!!!!

I don't mean 16 BUCKS a NIGHT people......I mean 16 BUCKS for the ENTIRE WEEK.....so naturally we ended up coming to Las Vegas. Now when you arrive at the hotel you have to be careful because the parking structure is on the backside of the hotel. So while you may be able to come into the front entrance you will have to park in the rear....but hear is a tip USE YOUR GPS....and FOLLOW the instructions to the letter and they will lead you to exactly where you need to be. I know this hotel is right in the middle of the strip on world Famous LAS VEGAS BLVD.....but you can't access the hotel parking from here without running into hundreds of people....so you have been warned!!!

The entrance to the hotel and Casino is on the 3rd floor...but chances are you won't get to park on that level because it is always full. However there is parking on the other levels which go up an additional 4 levels...but be advised if you park on level 7 you will have to walk down to level 6 to get the elevator to come down to level 3 where the entrance is because the elevator does not go up to level 7. Also try to park by the elevator....and don't stay out to late because i promise you you will be parking far away if you do no matter what level your on....and the walk  will be a beast.

The line for check was long when we arrived....but here it is always that way. It does move along fairly quickly but you must have some patience. The front desk staff are very nice and courteous.....the rooms are very nice as well....although i would have preferred a fridge and microwave in it. We stayed on the 16th floor in a deluxe suite with 2 queen beds with a great view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains. Now you will here a lot about the GO rooms...but i wouldn't pay extra...there not that special except for some better views and those might have a fridge....but not sure.

The Wildlife Habitat is pretty nice...the pool was closed...so that was a bummer but i still got some great pics of it so you can check those out. I forgot being that it is November so probably a little cool even by Vegas standard for it to be open...LOL. The shops are just average....and so are the restaurants....but this place called the Burger Joint has a great burger and fries deal for 3.99 from 12 midnight until 6am every night if you hungry late. The monorail also runs here...but it is $6.00 one way...so unless you just want to try it.....i would walk because most everything from here is in walking distance....or take a cab....it might be cheaper...LOL.

While this is an older hotel....and there was a red spot on the rug...looks like nail polish or paint....the rooms and grounds were very immaculate. The location is unmatched being that the Bellagio and Caesar's Palace are across the street.....Bally's....the Imperial Palace....Harrah's.....The mirage....City Center.....The Paris....The Eiffel Tower....Planet Hollywood......Fashion Show Mall....and Treasure Island are all withing walking distance. No other hotel on the strip can brag about that. 

I will be coming here annually starting next year...and believe me this will be my choice for staying (barring the prices are right....LOL) because i simply loved my stay here. So remember while your in Vegas my friends: ""Whatever Happens in Vegas will be on Facebook"" and Eat, Drink, and Be Very Merry my Friends!!!!!",6,3,4

Since I get to stay at all of Harrah's chain hotel\/casino free, if it weren't for the new Go room, I'd probably never stay here.  The Go room's primary color is Flamingo pink.  It has a huge white vinyl headboard with sleek modern furniture.  They upgraded the bed to ultra-soft pillow-top mattresses and plush linens which are quite nice.  The room is also equipped with 42-inch flat panel TV and a built-in one in the bathroom mirror.  I love the jetted shower fixture but I hate the vanity bowl (only 1!).  And how can they forget a magnifying mirror?????  How was I supposed to apply my make up without it?  Ugh!  It also has a host of cutting edge digital accessories including top-of-the-line sound system, iPod docking station, CD\/DVD player, electronic window treatments, all of which I really don't care for.  I mean, how much time do we stay in the room when in Vegas????  OK, so I give them credit for renovating the rooms, but they did nothing to improve sound-proof.  It was so noisy even with my ear plugs I could hear my neighbor's TV and everyone talking\/walking down the hallway.  

The buffet was horrible even though it was free to me (comp'ed).  I only ate here because the diamond lounge was not open yet and I was hungry and too lazy to walk\/drive anywhere.  It was only breakfast, so how bad could it get right?  WRONG!  It was BAD.  If I actually had to pay $17.99 per person, I'd have been pi$$ed.  

The diamond lounge opens at noon.  It's different from the other diamond lounges because it actually serves SUSHI!!!  How cool is that?  I mean, it's not fancy sushi, but California roll, spicy tuna, and a couple of other ones are really nice additions to the usual deli sandwiches.  They also serve soups which are not found in other diamond lounges.  

The casino is small compare to the rest of Harrah's chain casinos.  It doesn't bother me because I just play else where and still accumulate my total rewards points.  

The spa\/fitness facility are not the greatest but the massage therapist, Annacita (spelling?) is the best.  I would have never thought to get a spa treatment here.  But I got a Spa Get-Away offer with 3 days 2 nights stay and 2 spa treatments, all free on the house, I had to take advantage of it.  I chose 2 deep tissue massages for 2 days and I was in heaven.  I've since come back and booked massages with Annacita.  $125 for 50 minutes (on weekend) and it was worth every penny of it!!!  The staffs at the spa are super nice and hospitable.   

All and all, Flamingo is just an average casino\/hotel.",2,1,3

Pros
- Excellent Location.  Right in the middle of the strip
- Go Room was well worth the price.  Nice lighting that's almost a little kinky. The bed was comfortable and the view was great.
- They have a nice pool
- Take a walk outside for a break and enjoy their koi pond and real pink flamingos
- Plenty of table games and slots.  Limits are ~$10 even on a weekday morning.

Cons
- No security at the hotel elevators so be wary of your surroundings when you walk to your room and put your valuables in your in-room safe
- There was a huge gap under the door that kept bringing in draft.  Someone was also smoking in the hallway for 2 nights and that came right into the room.  I learned to block under the door with pillows to stop the smoke from coming in.
- Comes with cheaper hotels, but people would laugh and talk freely in the hallways.
- Internet here sucks.  They claim 5mbps and you need to pay extra to get 10mbps, but both were flaky.  I kept getting sent to login over and over.  The internet was useless in the morning that I had to go to a nearby coffee shop.
- Their diamond lounge is not so premium feeling
- Parking building exists, but a little tough to park because Cromwell people use it too
- Not much of a food selection in Flamingo, but you are surrounded by them if you walk out.

In summary, it's a great value for the price in a very good location.
Hey, it's either $50\/night at the Flamingo or $150\/night at Bellagio.  I would suck it up and save the money and go use it on food or a show.",6,4,5

When we checked into the room everything seemed normal. We dropped our suitcases off and headed down stairs to gamble and eat. When we came back to our room, my mother in law decided to take a shower. She pulled the curtains back and in the tub were the dirty towels from the people who stayed in the room before us. They were just laying in the tub. We called downstairs and they sent someone up to clean the bathroom and provide clean towels. 

Now don't get me wrong, ok dirty towels in the bathroom, not that big of a deal. But that was just the start. After my mother in law took a shower, we noticed that the walls in the shower and all along the cocking of the bath tub was MOLD, and tons of it. It was in the grout of the tiles and the texture of the tiles. DISGUSTING! I mean, I get that they are doing a re-model of the hotel, but come on, they can't keep a bathroom clean of mold?!? 

So, moving on from the bathroom, I started to look at everything. We didn't have a ""Do not disturb"" sign in the room, so I walked down to the front desk and asked for one. They told me they didn't have anymore and there was nothing they could do about it. We are talking about a huge hotel in Las Vegas and they don't have enough, let alone extra ""Do not disturb"" signs.  Oh and did you know that anyone staying below the top two floors no longer get coffee pots. Apparently, if you stay below the top two floors you are no longer good enough for complementary coffee. 

So yes, the hotel is old and is under going a remodel. Their buffet, which I have heard is good, was closed during prime hours. It was only open from 9am-2pm and their coffee shop was closed down completely. There were NO signs posted about the closure of the coffee shop or the shortened hours of the buffet. A ""guard"" was standing in front of the entrance to the area both were in and told us the information. When we asked the front desk about it, the lady didn't even know that the coffee shop was closed and that the buffet had modified hours.

*FOLLOW UP FOR PARANORMAL STORY READERS*
This happened following my posting of review. Now I'm not much of a ghost follower, or have interest in such things. But during the night, after gambling away 40 dollars, I returned to my hotel room at about midnight. As I was trying to get to sleep, I noticed a very odd buzzing of the alarm clock, in sporadic, untimely spurts. Figuring it to be a malfunction, I closed my eyes. A cold chill rushed over me, and a strong pain in my elbow followed. I looked up, and saw only darkness. I look around and over in the corner where the restroom and closet is, and a dark silhouette stands there. I don't know if this is my imagination creating this, but I haven't even fallen asleep, and I see this thing. I close my eyes again. I hear the bathroom faucet run out of nowhere. Four knocks on the wall. Once I finally do manage to fall asleep, I dream of a bloody, angry woman's face. Next I am being chased by a gang in a 2014 Chevy Camaro, and they are chasing with intentions of murder. I never remember my dreams, but I remember these two. Terrifying, but an experience to remember.",0,1,0

The pool closed an hour and a half early with ZERO prior notification. We ordered a $40 drink and 10 minutes later a security guard came by to tell us that the pool was closing in 2 minutes. Then, in a city where you can bring your drink to go just about EVERYWHERE, they made us throw out a 3\/4 full $40 drink in a plastic cup. There were at least 100 people at the pool and when we went by the desk to complain the main hotel manager said he could do nothing about it because it wasn't his area, but that it was probably because it's out of season...  Out of season? The sun was shining, no clouds and it was about 75 degrees outside. The pool was so busy there weren't even any chairs available when we got there. He also didn't seem to be concerned with any of the other people complaining about the same issue. 

The staff has been all around rude from the get go. 

The hotel room looks like it hasn't been updated since the 70s. Water pressure in the shower is almost non existent. The heater and air condition is LOUD.

I could honestly keep going with the problems here but this place has already wasted enough of my time.

I'm not sure of any selling point for this hotel and casino, as the few nicer amenities they claim to offer (and charge $25 per day on top of your room rate) don't even exist. 

Save yourself a terrible trip and waste of money and stay just about anywhere else on the strip.

Upon arrival and in the parking lot elevator, which I may add, it was extremely hot in the elevator.  We arrived at the hotel and I have to say I was a bit disappointed, the elevator didnt take us straight into the  hotel lobby, so we had walk, not far but still it was inconvenient.
Walking through the lobby, I noticed the touristy stores appeared nice at first glance but carried items that I wouldnt really buy anyway.   So at first glance, it looked ok.  
When we go to our room, I would say I was underwhelmed.  Either we got the old section of the hotel or it just wasnt as clean as I expected.  There was no bed spread which I found out  later is the case for all the rooms now?   And the lights in the bathroom were missing their lamp shades.  Strange. 
Also, after the first night, the sink started to get clogged, so I called housekeeping and they took care of it.  
The second housekeeper actually cleaned the bathroom after the repair person had called her.  The bathroom was actually cleaner than when we first arrived. 
I can overlook a lot but I thought for $100 a night, this was a lot considering we can spend a lot less in down town and get a place that's cleaner.  
Also, I was bombarded by the very pushy sales girl at one of the boutique shops.  It was quite annoying. 
We chose not to eat here as I didnt want to be further disappointed.  I did play a little bit that night. 
Note: There werent too many quarter machines.  It went from penny slots to $5 slots with not many quarter or $1 slots in between.   

The pool was nice and spacious despite the crowd on that 100 degree day.  Every spot near the pool was taken, but I lucked out and grabbed a seat while my hubby and son took a swim.  There's a really nice waterfall area.   However, there's a basketball net and it can get rowdy.  
It wasn't bad at all considering it was a big mix of singles, families, young and old. 
Would i come back? Probably not but it wasn't the worst experience.  I would give this place 3 stars had the room been cleaner, slightly more upgraded and if the elevator had not been so shabby.  There were things hanging off the ceiling.  Gross!",3,1,2

We get there and they have us in a FAB room instead, he said he was going to get us a ""free"" fridge. Well, we ended up paying $50 more for the more average room with a view of the roof. I didn't want to set the tone for our trip to be lousy so I let that part go, my friend and I used my card for a $200 deposit that no one told us about at the time of reservation 2 months ago, and then we split the cash for the room which was another $720 for 4 nights. Which was steep considering everything was so expensive. Water $4 16 oz drink at pool is $16.

Location of hotel was good, and there is ONE bar in the hotel that offered $6 alcoholic drinks, wish I had known that on day one instead of paying all that money for a drink!

Pool was nice, but during the week it is the same as the family pool as the hotel was filled with mostly retirees which was disappointing.

I only gambled with a small amount of money but did end up leaving with the same amount so I would say the slot machines were good.

Upon arriving at home, I checked my online bank balance and the man at the front desk (who was trying to be charming but really was a scam artist) not only took our cash payment for the payment of the room and the 200 deposit from MY bank card, and told me it would be back in 2 days after checkout. Well,,,,,they charged me for the room too!! Sooo I paid twice for the room. AND now I will not get the money back for 7-10 business days, which is really at least 2 weeks since it is now weekend.
I am so disappointed in the front desk. Everything that I was told on the phone during the reservation was not true, everything I was told upon check in about the financial part was not true either.
My affordable vacation just got super expensive and now I have bounced checks and am unable to pay my house payment. All because of the scam artist at the front desk, who was probably going to pocket my cash payment of $620 in hopes that I would not notice the charge on my bank account. 
I have stayed here previously but will NEVER stay again. Nor will I recommend it to anyone.

Ive added a few pics of the room and the view.

we really liked having a tv in the mirror in the bathroom. lol. cool option. although ours didnt work. the one in my parents room did though.

we really liked the options of food at 2, 3 or 4am when we get off the gaming tables, have something to eat and stumble up to our rooms lol. since we are from hawaii, we dont have johnny rockets. we liked the food there. also the hot dog place, and the asian food places have also satisfied our cravings in the middle of the night haha.

great location, with the linq and harrahs on one side, and the cromwell on the other. also the Caesars palace across the street, and the bellagio down the road, we could actually see part of the bellagio water fountain show while we were waiting for the elevator on our floor. hotel is easily accessible although there is construction in neighboring areas. and the valet staff is very helpful when we needed directions or recommendations on other asian restaurants in the area and how to get there.

i really liked the renovation and re organization of the casino in the table game area. i also like the new slot machines and the penny slots they added. (to me, its new since i havent been there in a couple of years)

The first two nights we stayed in one of their deluxe rooms.  The bathroom floor had hair on it; it looked like it hadn't been swept. The stopper in the sink didn't work so my husband had to do a water in the glass work-around for shaving. The sheets had some dried blood stains on them and we found a stray pubic hair that did not belong to us.  **shudder** The floor in the bedroom also had some random trash around it.  The last straw was when I found ants in the bathroom one morning. We didn't have any food in our room.  

So, I upgraded to the GO room for an extra $30\/night (the deal had changed after initial check-in, I guess).  There was an employee checking on the folks in the check-in line (which was quite long at that point) and I told her my plight. She immediately whisked me to the front of the line where the preferred members check-in.  The man who helped me find a new room was great and allowed me to check out the cleanliness of the room before I committed to moving.  The staff was extremely helpful and professional about the whole situation.

The GO room is a significant upgrade.  Even the towels are nicer. The carpets are still worn and stained but the bathroom is much better, there is a coffee-maker, and the sheets are softer. 

Overall the hotel is fine. I would stay here again but only in a GO room.  The location is great, too.",3,0,0

I personally love this place. I have stayed and played here many times. I would tell anyone, traveler or local, to get the players card. It is sooo worth it. With the card you will get great deals and free stay if applicable.

The casino itself is usually busy and has a great energy. The slots are pretty loose and you can win big.. I have. Know that you need to play more than bare minimum for a good win though.

The servers and floor people are very friendly and attentive when you treat them nicely. ( always amazed at how rude some people are to these servers over FREE cocktails, there are more people than just you waiting for a drink...be nice and wait your turn)

The food court has great choices. I am partial to the sub place. See my other reviews for that one.

The place has great shows and is center strip so it is really a great jumping off point.

The buffet is huge and you will get a discount with the card.

Our room over looked the strip, and the biggest highlight was.... It was facing the water show at the Bellagio!!! Got to see the water show for only $10\/night extra compare to the $300+ \/ night in the other hotels! 

Cons:: very small room. And the carpets look and probably is dirty. Guess they didn't change the carpet during the renovation.

Still a very old hotel do can't really blame them with the old outdated rooms and hallways.",0,0,0

Review #11:
inside, this place is average, probably 2.5 stars; the restaurants are very uninspired and behind Vegas standards; Margaritaville is huge & sprawling, with a casino of its own, but a total tourist trap; one thing this place has going for it (besides history) is the outdoor gardens - very unique & relaxing, including lots of birds (including flamingos, natch) & big fishies; there is also a sprawling 3rd floor maze of conference rooms; plus, the new Linq area of shops & restaurants next door is probably a good thing for The Flamingo, as it's the best place to park & walk through for access; best craft beer bet = well, the ex-Sin City Brewing Co. bar is now just a regular bar, but their beer selection is pretty decent, though dominated by IPA's; most of the little shops have a good variety of Rogue beers in bottles, surprisingly.",2,0,0

I for one did not want to spend 150+ a night. so instead i spent 120 dollars for 3 nights at the flamingo for an impromptu getaway with my boyfriend. and for that kind of money, it was BOMB!

so what did i get for the 120?

i got what i think was a double bed GO room, even though i booked a single bed cheap room which was a nice surprise. apparently they ran out of king size beds so we got a free upgrade. some cons about the room were that one of the lamps wouldnt turn on and there were two MYSTERIOUS yellow drops on our rug....(we are going to assume the worst and say it was barf?) didn't complain about the ""barf"" tho becuz i didn't feel like switching rooms. Another thing about the room was that it was facing the parking garage for the imperial palace, which was also going to be demolished at 3am. We had gotten a note apologizing for the inconvenience, and to a lot of people i'm sure it would have been, but for me and my boyfriend it was the coolest thing about the room! and believe me, watching that garage go down was really exhilarating! other aspects of the room like the size gets a 5, cleanliness(other than barf rug) and decorations deserve a solid 4. (again, remember, we are only paying 20 dollars a night per person.... REALLY not that bad) 

we also got a free coupon booklet that had all these buy one get one free deals which was nice. i mean, the deals were mostly ""buy a (cheap hotel name) buffet and get one free"" really not that great of food i know. but think about it, me and my boyfriend were literally paying 15 dollars for 2 people's dinners. i mean the food tastes like 15 dollar food, but i am also only paying half of that. and having as much frozen yogurt that i wanted. definitely worth the money. it also had coupons for the shops in the forum which was nice, and a coupon even for the rio buffet which was EXTREMELY NICE, but this is about the flamingo....

i also really liked the flamingos LOCATION. right across the street from my favorite sites in vegas which are serendipity 3 (ate there 2 of the three days) and the forum! it was also right next to my favorite cheap gambling hotel which was bills gamblin' saloon (lots of 5 dollar blackjack tables open!) its also in the middle of the strip and within walking distance of the bellagio's water show, and TI's pirate ship.

aspects of the flamingo itself i liked were of course the bird garden zoo thing (even tho it smelt of bird poop) and the pool was pretty nice for what it was.

now the flamingo loses a star because of customer service, or lack there of. checking in and out is a slow, time consuming process. I remember at caesars palace it was maybe 2 minutes. here it was a good 15 minutes and we were only 4 groups from the front. also, the first day we were there they didnt have any of the coupon booklets available so i had to go back the next day which wasn't a problem. the problem was when i did go back, i stood aside waiting for the next available person becuz my question was going to take a grand total of 5 seconds. they tried to get me to stand in the check in line again and i refused to because i wasn't going to wait half an hour! i went up after a women was done with her customer and instead of doing the customer service thing and asking what she could help me with, she ignored me. it was ridiculous. i know she thought i was rude for coming up to her even though she hadnt called me up and i know she assumed i just wanted to cut everyone else in line(which was true) but still. even when you think your customer is being rude they are still your customer and you do what you can. I am also in customer service and i know how aggravating it is when someone does that, but i also know that i still help them with the same level of service becuz its my fucking job! im not there to teach them manners, thats not why i'm paid. i'm paid to shut my mouth and help and that woman needs to learn that.

however i'm sure that was an independent persons response to me and not the flamingos fault, but they should be more aware of the people they have working for them.


overall i thought the flamingo was worth every dime i spent there. and that is why i rated it so highly",0,0,0

I have stayed at all the hotels in the Total Rewards program. Valet parking and the parking lot were full. We were directed to Imperial Palace or Ballys. I have never experienced this in all the years I have visited Las Vegas especially on a non-holiday weekend. We had to walk with our luggage in the hot sun for about 1\/2 an hour. When I complained to the manager he said there wasn't anything he can do. The only explanation he gave was the hotel gets ""lively"" on the weekends. He also said it gets like that every weekend (the no parking). I told him I will not ever stay there again and that if I had known of their parking problem I would have stayed somewhere else. I asked for some kind of compensation for our inconvenience he said there was nothing he could do. I am a customer service trainer and this is by far the worst customer service I have experienced. No apology, no explanation, no attempt to remedy the situation or make our discomfort better. I wasn't asking for my room to be free but damn a discount, free lunch, upgrade or at least a heartfelt apology would have gone a long way. So I will tell all my friends who frequent Vegas to not stay here. To top it off the iron was missing from the room and the phone didn't work. Also, I posted this on their Facebook page and they quickly deleted it without addressing it. Very shady and unprofessional.",2,1,0

The temperature outside was 112. There is no ventilation in these elevators and at one point the power to the elevator was completely turned off. It was complete darkness inside.  After over an hour of maintenance trying to fix it, I called the Hotel Manager on duty, Joshua, and urged him to call the Fire Department. Why weren't they dispatched sooner? Security could give me no answers. We had no water and became very hot and dehydrated. We told security we were stuck on the forth floor, and  it turns out we were. Yet, security couldn't find us for the first hour, even though we told them in the first minute we were on the 4th floor. They found us after much screaming on my part. Security told us to wait patiently for a repair man. Again, why  wasn't the fire department called right away? I am very fortunate to have not had a panic attack. I have already had 11, Yes, ELEVEN Heart Surgeries. I had to keep myself calm the whole time or this could have ended very badly. So after nearly 2 hours in the hot elevator, the fire department got us out. 
     What bothers me most is, the hotel KNOWS about these elevator issues. Negligent? You read the Yelp reviews on your property correct? They date back for years about the elevator problems. Josh told me ""We're working on it."" Band aid solutions to fixing these elevators are not working are they? Spend the money and install new elevators. Are you waiting for the next guest to get stuck and die of a heart attack or heat exhaustion? You know about these issues, yet you continue to put the health and safety of the hotel guest at risk. 
     You're probably tired of hearing the same thing over and over again. So why not FIX the problem? If you replace these old, outdated elevators then you won't be shelling out money consistently to hotel guests after their experiences getting stuck. The fire truck won't have to show up in your front parking lot daily, like it does now, to rescue people from the elevators. You won't be facing a future class action lawsuit from multiple people who got stuck. You know very well about the problem, so one thought comes to my mind. Negligence",0,0,0

At check-in we found out that they didn't have any more GO rooms available, so we had to settle on one of their regular rooms.  I had been warned before we came to Vegas that the Flamingo rooms are pretty old and shabby, so I wasn't too surprised to see the faded carpet and chipping paint.  The room was pretty worn out, but it was still clean, so I didn't mind it so much.  Besides, it wasn't like we were going to spend much time in our rooms anyway.  We were lucky that they put us near the top floor so we had a great view.

Except for playing a few slot machines, we never gambled at the Flamingo.  There are just better places to go nearby.  Being one of the older casinos on the strip, I think the retro atmosphere draws in an older audience (lots of grandmas hogging the Cash Spin machines), so we preferred to spend our time with a younger crowd.  While we were staying at the Flamingo, Donny and Marie were their star performers, so I think that says a lot about the clientele they attract.

However, the Flamingo does have the best location right in the middle of the strip, just across from Caesar's Palace and just few minutes from the Bellagio and Venetian.  The casino is built up instead of sprawling out, so it's a lot quicker to walk through and it is connected to the monorail, so it's easy to get to some of the farther casinos like the MGM.

If you want a cheap place to stay that is centrally located, and you're not planning on spending much time in your hotel, then the Flamingo should work for you.",1,0,1

When my friends and I arrived for our GNO trip, check in was a breeze. We headed up to our non smoking room and neither of our key cards were working. 

Some of us stayed back in the hallway, as the others went down to get help. There were many young guys and dolls popping in and out of their rooms, offer I us beer and a good time. 

Luckily, our friends returned not only with working keys, but with working keys to a strip view room closer to the elevator. The only downfall was that it would be in the smoking section. 

So, we headed over to our room, and opened our door to a decent sized room with a TINY bathroom. They need to remodel the bathrooms because they are total shit. Leaky faucets in a tiny space that remind me of a motel. 

We tried to upgrade, but everything was sold out. It was a crazy packed weekend. 

You couldn't smell the smoke from the hallway inside of the room which was a blessing, and the air conditioning was great. Room service was so fast and efficient, we didn't expect our room to be cleaned upon our return.

At least the curtains were pretty. They made for a nice backdrop for pictures, and were fun to pull open to reveal the view. This hotel seemed to be targeted at female visitors, as much of the decor was pink.

The pool at the Flamingo was probably the best part of our stay. It was clean, there were plenty of towels, and the people were nice. There are real live flamingos and other birds on the grounds en route to the pool. 

The slide was so much fun. You can relive your earliest days as a child when you slide down the water slide with a bunch of friends.

There weren't any clubs we wanted to go to at the Flamingo, but we had no fear: the Flamingo is in a prime location, at about the middle of the strip. 

Check out and valet took a little while, as everyone seemed to be leaving at the same time.

All in all, a good hotel for a group trip-the kind of group trip where you are hardly on your room save for sleeping;)!",7,2,2

The room was very cool, I loved the big windows with automatic curtains. The T.V. in the bathroom mirror was a big plus too with surround sound. My friend kept saying he won't be able to shit again unless he can watch ESPN with surround sound at the same time.

We are all just 21 so we are tight on money and dug the fact that there were a good selection of penny slots downstairs with active drink girls and a $1 burger after midnight which was unbelievable. Located right next to 2 of the best cheap gambling spots on the strip, Bill's and O'Shea's. Bill's has great $5 blackjack tables which is a rare find. Oshea's has Beer Pong for God's sake.

Overall, I believe if you aren't already a Vegas snob, you will have a great time here.

I am kind of frustrated because I've yet to receive my $100 deposit that I should have received from my last visit, so hopefully that gets taken care of soon. The casino and hotel is definitely not as fancy as some of the newer and bigger hotels, but they are fun and not as intimidating either. There is a bar inside called Carlos something I believe, and they regularly have a deal where after 10pm, you can pay $20\/$25 and get free drinks all night and come and go as you please. That attracts a lot of different people. It's fun for a more low-let dance venue as well.",3,0,1

I didn't stay here for the pool but it was definitely an added bonus. I fit in the under 30's crowd and felt like this was a good hotel for that age group. This place probably does attract some older people (hence the Donnie and Marie show) but they are definitely in the minority poolside. Of course you still get a few over 45's that are in bikinis and in denial. 

We ended up spending most of our daytime hanging out by the pool which was like a huge party\/club. Great music with a DJ, bikini clad dancers, and some great beer prices. You could get a bucket of 5 beers for $20 or 12 for $40. 

One negative is that they don't have a clear signage telling you that there is no food or drinks allowed to be taken inside the pool premises. Lots of people were having to throw their items away before entering. Which after having stood  in line for 15 min can become very irritating.

At first glance, the hotel is cute and kitschy. Everything is pink. The 5-year-old girl in me was thrilled. The room actually had a nice view of the strip, which I loved because I always end up with a view of parking garages whenever I come to Vegas. I really liked the animal exhibits. The flamingos and pelicans were fun!

However, we soon figured out that everything was nearly falling apart. The bottom fell out of the trash can. Our toilet flusher had broken completely off and had to be replaced while we waited. The sconces in the bathroom were corroded.

One hindrance was the fact that the rooms had no wifi or cell service whatsoever. We could connect to the wifi, but it seemed that the wifi itself was spottily connected to the internet at best. I couldn't even make phone calls from my cell phone in the room. This became especially bothersome when I had to do some work while there. Jumping onto a Webex was impossible from the room, and their ""business center"" was merely a bank of computers inside of a UPS store. There was nowhere quiet to sit down and make a call. I ended up squatting on the floor in an empty conference room in the basement.

I their pool was nice though. We got a cabana, and the service was ok, but it was a little awkward at the end...they include a gratuity in the check, which is fair and standard. As the waitress handed me the bill, she said that if I wanted to leave an additional tip, I could do so on the receipt. I wanted to talk amongst my friends to decide whether we wanted to give them more money, but she just stood there and watched us. I felt kinda pressured, so I just signed it, being that gratuity was included. After a moment, she came back and made me ""fill out"" the receipt and write in the total, seemingly a last ditch effort to get a bigger tip. It's pretty standard that if you don't fill it out and gratuity was included, then there's no additional tip. I thought that was very tacky and awkward.

I knew going in that the Flamingo had issues.
But I did not want to pay premium price since I was there for a convention.

The Good
I found staff from front desk to housekeeping to be very professional and attentive.
The room was very basic and clean. 
2 beds, vinyl floors a TV and a desk.

The location cannot be beat.
Everything I was looking for.

The Bad
Long Lines everywhere, from check in, getting food, getting your luggage, getting on the elevator, getting in the pool.

Being pestered by time share sales people.
Old rickety elevators, packed with people looking like a scene from Final Destination was about to unfold. 

Frat House mentality, drunk college kids screaming in the hallways at 4am. 
The 1990s called they want their decor back.

The Fix
I reserved the 4th floor, and took the stairs. (They are by the luggage check in by the way)
Arrived at 11am and left luggage with bell service and got it myself later.

Checked in at 1pm and avoided the 4pm mega crush
Relaxed at the Family pool not the Go pool. 

Expect loud music, douche-bags, and amateurs who cannot handle liquor at the Go Pool, if you like that type of crowd.

As the saying goes you get what you pay for.

We landed to Vegas at early dawn. We had a full day to roam around before we were able to check in. Called at around 1130 am to check and see if we can check in early. Lady answered politely and said that room should be available   after 12:30 pm. We were so happy to know that we can check in early. Little did we know that that wasn't the case.

We got to the hotel around 1 and decided to check in. We didn't wait to long to check in and lady at the front desk let us check in though room was not cleaned. We understand that that could happen though we were notified over the phone that it would be ready by then. She was kind enough to give us a small upgrade that will oversee the strip so we didn't mind the wait. Friends and I check in to the pool for a while just to kill some time. 4:00 pm came and my friend was able to get keys so we can dry up and get cleaned since we were down the pool and it was hot. 

We then started to head to our room so we can get cleaned up. It was a little bit weird that when we got to in front of our room, there was a disable motored wheelchair parked right in front. Knocked on the door and no answer. Knock once more and still no answer. We assumed that it was next door so we decided to open the door. Voila and there was an older lady chillin in room. She said that the room was hers until she checks out due to her late check in.

We were kind of irritated the fact that they would give us a room that still have people in it. It was obvious that it didn't start good to begin with. So head down to the registration area and talked to one of their customer service. We explained the situation that it was unacceptable to give us a room that still have people in it. He did his thing by looking in the computer to check to see if he can give us a comparable room. Though it took him a while to find us another room but when he did finally found one, we head to over and it was all the way to the end of building and a cleaning lady was still cleaning the room.

My friends and I were so furious that after one room to the other, another problem arises. We then called the guest services again, telling the rep that this was completely unacceptable, we were then moved to another room. But this was not the last of it, again, the room is being cleaned AGAIN. Though we had a nice view of Ceasar's, the overall experience made it still infuriating. 

We thought that this would no go no where and just to bite our tongue. We let the cleaning lady finished cleaning our room and move on.

Was to stay Sat. thru Mon. When going to bed the first night we noticed a plaster bubble right above our head on the ceiling. We joked about it breaking up over us while we slept. Little did we know IT WAS TO COME TRUE. At 3:30am water started dripping heavily on our head. We called the front desk about 10 minutes later who said they would send up an engineer and the manager. No manager ever came. The engineer came about 4am, looked and said he'd come back and NEVER CAME BACK. We had already packed up, couldn't sleep in a puddle, right? Called the front desk again. No call back from manager or engineer. Called front desk a 3rd time and after 1hr and 1\/2 we walked ourselves downstairs with our stuff to speak to someone, ANYONE!

Our main concern was, WHAT KIND OF WATER WAS THAT??? But when we brought that issue up to anyone's attention we were basically laughed at. The night manager, Theresa, First thing our of her mouth "" I guess we have a cleaning problem haha"". Then she proceeded to blame the guest above us as being ""passed out and leaving the sink on."" Flamingo...don't blame your guests and we are not idiots, bubbles don't form in plaster on a one-time sink overflow.

So much more to say but in a nutshell...management staff was unprofessional, 1 and 1\/2hrs to talk to them and WE had to find them. The room they wanted give us was bigger, yes, but also FILTHY and the clerk at Keys and Mail who gave us that room acted like we were lucky to get this upgrade because we bought an inexpensive room anyway. Insulting. We asked to make an Incident Report and it took another 1 and 1\/2hrs to speak to someone in Security.

We left. Woke up a family member, who lives nearby, at 430am. Still do not know what kind of water was dripping on us. We better not get sick....",6,3,0

One star for the cool pool set up, and the second for the location.  That's about it.  

Let the bitching begin, I stayed in a double bed room, and the bathroom was the size of my closet in SF.  Totally understand this is a more affordable priced hotel, but come on.  There was also one body mirror, which was hard when you're cramming four girls into a room.  

The never ending hallways is a problem.  On the first night, one of my friends was in the hallway on the phone and started pacing.  Unfortunately, she was tipsy, the hallway is one of those long, all the doors look the same so we lost her for a good hour until she was able to find which room was ours.  Awesome.

Cons: A little outdated looking compared to other Casino resorts and ice machines never refilled, parking spot hunts could last a long time, key cards always seemed to stop working

My family and I stayed at the Flamingo on our recent trip to Vegas. They have a parking garage for the guests. It's free, but because it's free, you have to search for a while to find a spot that isn't a valet or reserved for Hertz or another hotel. The hotel itself is very nice and seems family friendly. I would suggest arriving early before check in because the line was ridiculously long. Check in took us about an hour from after we arrived. Once checked in, you will have to traverse the casino floor to get to the hallway with the elevators. Sounds simple enough until you realize that the casino is full of cigarette smoke, and you have hotel staff offering the passing guests information on various shows in Las Vegas. 

The elevators to go up to the rooms vary in appearance. Some are in definite need of renovating. There may be markings on the walls and doors or you may be lucky enough to have loose panels in the elevator you get to ride in. When you make it to the floor, if you are lucky like us, you will get to walk down the entire hallway to get to your room(s). It really wasn't as bad as I am trying to make it sound because once inside, the room is very nice, clean and pretty modern looking. My family was lucky enough to have a room facing the strip and I loved that about our room. The one thing that I did not like was that they charge extra for a refrigerator and because of opting out of that feature, we had to get ice for our cooling needs. That wasn't so bad until we realized that the ice machine around the corner from our rooms was never filled and so we had to walk all the way back towards the elevators to use the machine around that corner and down the hall next to the vending machine. 

Over our stay, housekeeping did a great job of redoing our rooms and even though it is one of the older hotels on the strip, I enjoyed staying here. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a reasonably priced hotel with a great location. (Oh and a side, our key cards always seemed to not work. Even after going down to the Keys desk and having them reset, one key always didn't work. I am not sure if we were the only unlucky ones to have experienced this. )",1,0,0

Fairly decent hotel price for the go room and I can't get out of my head how comfortable the bed was.  Like seriously, I could sleep away the whole day in that bed before I hit the strip at night.  Which brings to mention the location.  I love how I can just be in the center of everything for a cheaper price without the feeling of a stay at a mediocre place like Harrah's.  The pool here is also really something else.  I mean, I guess that's what Flamingo's is known for.  You would definitely need to check out the pool at least once if you make your stay here.

Of course, this hotel does need more remodeling but the ambiance gives you the feeling of how it was like back in the days.  And as for the gaming, I remember I had a good run here once but its too early to say this place was a good place for me.  All in all, this hotel was a pretty good stay but make sure you stay in the the Go room or higher otherwise, this might differ.

We had comped rooms which was nice but after checking in I completely understood why. The first issue we came to was parking... There was no valet parking unless you were diamond+ and their close parking lot was full. This was a major bummer as it was about 114 outside and not a pleasant walk from about 5 blocks away where we finally found street parking.

The hotel room was decent - It was a standard room with one king bed. They had replaced the flooring with a faux wood floor that was some kind of tile. That gave it a clean look. Negative points for no coffee maker or refrigerator.

The halls in the hotel really needed to be updated. The wallpaper was peeling in places and the carpets were in terrible shape. I guess it didn't matter too much as we just walked these to the elevators and down to get right on the strip or play in the casino.

The elevators.... Ahhhh! I feel like I almost got stuck in one as it was heading down and took a big lurch mid floors and then started heading up?? As soon as it opened I got the hell off as I didn't want to spend all day trapped in an elevator... Or worse??

The reason for 2 stars... The casino floor. The flamingo seemed like a great off strip casino floor.. Slightly dated tables but really friendly local dealers and low minimums. The flamingo is actually right at the heart of the strip so this was refreshing and I did quite a bit of gambling here.

Our rom had NO view! It was a view of the building next door- literally a wall. We went down to see if we could switch or upgrade to a room with a view of the strip or the pool and they said yes for $30 a night. You really aren't in your room that much in Vegas anyways besides to sleep so we weren't willing to pay. If you are in your room that much that you need a good view you are doing Vegas wrong. Our room also had an adjoining door to the other room which I didn't like and we were in an upgraded room but the bathroom was still not upgraded which I didn't like. 
The show in the hotel was not happening when we left. the show is Donny and Marie which I heard is really good but they were traveling.

There were no locks on the bathroom which is bit uncomfortable if you value some privacy. The only positive notes was the view from our room.

1. The area is under construction so getting to the parking area was difficult; no signage to assist. 
2. There are 3 hotels in the area using one parking structure. Thank God for the Valet or we'd be parking in Lot 8 a few blocks away, walking in the cold weather past the construction sites. The Valet was the only good part about this hotel.
3. Check in took over an hour! They had only 2 people working the counter and each time someone was in the Rewards Line we had to continue to wait. Other guests who became too impatient to wait their turn actually went in that line (and the Mail Line) so they could be called ahead of the rest of us in the regular check in line. 
4. I had called in the day prior to confirm my room reservation because I wanted to make sure I got a King sized bed in my room. When we checked in, the woman at the front was trying to give us a room with two queens. When we reminded her the reservation was for a king, she said she could only give us a king room that was far from the elevator. She wasn't kidding. It was next to the stair well down two corridors. If we had been drunk, like she warned us, it would have been a problematic walk.
5. Most of lights in the elevators did not work! You had to go and push buttons for multiple elevator areas until you got one to light up. Inside the elevator you had to use both sides of the control panel to make sure your desired level had been requested.
6. There was not adequate lighting in the room itself. Only 3 lamps and one dinky overhead light when you walked into the room. I guess i was supposed to rely on the strip lighting up our room?
7. The shower\/tub spout constantly dripped after usage easily for an hour afterwards.
8. Rooms had laminate flooring, which looked pretty good, but when the girl above your room is drunkenly walking around her room in high heels, it's really quite annoying- especially when she's coming in from the club at 4am....
9. The mattresses are overly firm. Maybe this is the hotel just wanting to make sure that they get their 7+ years out of each mattress.
10. There was no door notice\/ sign saying to not have the room cleaned or to not bother the occupants. This was upsetting on the morning we were checking out, when they knock at each door of every person supposedly leaving that day to wake them up\/ double check that the group will be leaving the hotel before check out time.
11. I called the concierge desk through the room phone to purchase show tickets. I wanted them for a show on the following night. The woman on the other line said that the tickets were non-refundable. No problem. I actually wrote down the confirmation number (probably the first time in my life). Good thing I did. The woman bought tickets for the wrong day and spelled my name wrong. Our night was completely ruined. When discussing it with the Box Office representative in person she said that the hotel CONTRACTS OUT THEIR CONCIERGE SERVICE and I had an issue with the third party and NOT the hotel. All she did was cancel my tickets and refund my money (which is an obvious, but I had to request it) and then told me to have a good night. Worst customer service ever.
12. When checking out express (on the TV in the room, which it was a miracle it was an option), we noticed that there was a guest survey. Normally, I would never bother to take a survey for a hotel. However, the experience at the Flamingo demanded it. Surprise, surprise the survey via the television didn't work. We shut of the TV and tried again. Still didn't work. But you know what did? The Check out function.
13. I looked online to attempt to call the hotel or email them with my concerns. Check out the website- there is no link you can access them to contact them. I had to request my bill online to find a comment section where I asked for contact info. However, I had to wait three days for anything. 

This was probably one of the worst experiences I've ever had at any hotel on this planet (and i've stayed in some questionable hostels). The staff (minus the valet) was not helpful, didn't go an extra inch to do anything past their job description, and there's little hope of expressing it to anyone in management unless you want to wait and make a scene. I've heard the expression, ""You get what you pay for"" but in this case I paid for way more than what I got and it was terribly disappointing.",1,0,0

We stayed at the Flamingo three nights in august and the hotel gave us one of there remodeled rooms on the 25th floor. Im not going to complain the rooms were very nice (modern) the bathroom was very spacious, but the bathroom door was a sliding door that did not lock so if your sharing a room you have to make sure there is no one in the bathroom. The flamingo pool is ok, they have a pool for kids which has a slide and a pool for 21+ which has a cave (GO Pool) while in the GO pool I saw vomit in the pool and a man hurl while he was walking through which I considered a huge health hazard! The flamingo food court was under remodeling so the only thing open was the café which didn't really have much and closed early. My biggest pet peeve with this hotel was the parking!!!! the first two floors are valet parking and the third floor was only for Hertz rental cars, we spent an hour looking for parking till we finally gave up and decided to go to the valet, once were down there's a sign that said valet parking full! How is this possible the Wynn hotel has there own staff parking and yet guests at the flamingo don't have a place to park there car!

Located in the center of the Las Vegas strip. One of the original casino and hotels. Mostly remodeled rooms with dark colored hardwood floors. Beds are decently maintained.

First visit last year, we stayed during spring break. Management and counter staff were both uncoordinated to handle the volume of people in line. Wait time was about a good hour from back to front for the players line or just hotel guest line. At one point the management had pulled me to the side to try out the self check in only to say I had to go back into the line. Fortunately enough the person I was in front of let me back into the line.

My room preference (king nonsmoking) was unavailable when I got to the check in after staying at another casino hotel the night before without having my nonsmoking preference available. Offered two queens nonsmoking we gladly accepted. Room was nicely furnished with pink fur, pillows, a nice little split love seat chairs. Bathroom was properly sized and decently maintained. The room was quite nice for what I expected to  find and sitting in front of the strip. Room was kept nicely by the hotel housekeeping. Only downside to the view and room was the large Donnie and Marie advertising that was outside obstructed the view of Caesar and the strip.

We received our bill the last morning to encounter an issue with billing. We waited in the hotel line again to get the issue resolved. Another good 15 minutes to check out. We had to catch our shuttle and correcting the billing was a contributing factor for is to miss our shuttle. We asked the hotel staff regarding catching the shuttle to which we purchased a round trip to where we would go. The staff was unsure. The long line with the lack of clarity between the staff was not a good lasting impression. Although not favorable on service I was willing to give it another try recently. 

Recent visit in July, I wanted to see if I could check in before normal time of 4. I didn't want to pay the extra for the early check in (breakfast time) but willing to pay for the room upgrade. We waited in line and this time was significantly faster but still about 15 minutes. Neither of my requests could be accommodated and was told to try back a little after lunch from the clerk and her supervisor. We wait again in the line and at the time we were told to check back again. This time another half hour of my time. Again I could not check in. We had already eaten lunch and breakfast by this time. We were told to check in an hour and decided to just wait for regular check in at this point. We come back go check in at 4. Waited another 15 minutes in line to get room keys and everything settled. So for check in here expect to wait about one hour.

Room this recent trip was not nearly as maintained. It looked like the room itself was half updated and the casino hotel ran out of money to fix it up. The room was comfortable but decor appeared to be mismatched from the tables and the bed. This recent trip we cut short and checked out a day early. Again check out took about 15 minutes.

Water and room temperatures were okay. Towels and sheets were cleaned and stocked. 

The decor and upkeep on the hotel was a mixed bag. Service is incredibly slow on the hotel front desk.

Casino is also not kept well. Considering the age and the keep of the room, an update is needed on both. Machines are tight and table dealers are not friendly or helpful. 

Overall I have to drop what would be a two star for a one time visit. Second trips usually confirm assessments. In this case, one star unlikely to be out here to stay the night or gamble. I'll take my business elsewhere.",6,0,0

I stay in Vegas just about every other month and I've never had a worse customer experience and on my birthday weekend! Also, management was more trouble to deal with. I don't know how a hotel can put movie charges on your room that you didn't order, tell you there isn't a corporate number to file a complaint and call billing to dispute! I called billing and they said they can't override the manager, but do I want the corporate number...that I was originally told there wasn't one. This hotel was one issue after another. I will never stay here again. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! make sure you check your bill for hidden charges!!! Also, we went to our room after checking in and called the bell desk to bring up our luggage and we were told they are not allowed to do that! We would have to go down to the bell desk with photo ID to pick up our luggage!  Why would I use that service if they can't deliver our bags to our room! The rooms were freezing cold and there was no heat setting. The room was freezing the whole weekend and they only had one cheap little blanket on the bed...not even a sheet!

What I want to know is what the resort fee includes since we couldn't connect to WiFi and the manager, Emily, said she knew and it hadn't been working. We also had to pay to use the pool even though we were guests! How did we have to pay for that pool, but yet, drais beach club was complimentary! Made no sense! The managers at the hotel were so rude! They wouldn't even let me finish explaining before interrupting!

(Scroll to the bottom to get my summed up version, in case you don't have time to listen to my rant)

This review is long over due. I stayed here about 3 months ago and it was literally the worst experience I have ever had at a hotel. I work for a large hotel chain and have stayed at a lot of hotels. I also love Las Vegas and have stayed\/spent a lot of time in hotels all over Las Vegas. The flamingo was hands down the worst experience I have ever had. From check in to check out, I'm sad to say that I will stay at Motel 6 or the El Cortez downtown (FYI- the El Cortez is preeeeetty bad but not this bad) before I will stay at the Flamingo again. Let me explain... 

My girlfriend and I went to Vegas for a girls weekend. We were coming from Southern California and traffic was horrible. We got into town super late and just wanted to get checked in to our room. When we got to the hotel, their parking garages and valet parking were full. We ending up having to park BEHIND the high roller. Granted, this isn't a crazy long walk. However, that area is pretty sketchy at night. Not to mention, imagine 2 girls in their 20s, trying to drag their luggage to the hotel from this sketchy, dark parking lot in the middle of the night. Definitely not a good way to start off the trip. 

Once we got inside the hotel, there was a line from here to Timbuktu! It was insane! So we stood their patiently until it was our turn. We finally got to the front desk and gave the agent our information. She ""regretted to inform us"" that our suite had been ""given away"" and that they only had standard rooms left (side note- I don't care what hotel chain you work for, if the hotel messes up and becomes over sold on a specific room type, you neeeeever tell that to the guest!!!). We specifically booked a suite because of the bad reviews we saw online for their standard rooms but we had no choice and had to stay in one of their standard rooms. 

We made our way up to the room and the room was just... gross! Besides the room being dark and dated, the room hadn't been thoroughly cleaned. There was trash in the trash cans from previous guests and a poker chip on the floor. This was the only time in my life that I called down to the front desk and requested to move rooms. The agent told me they were sold out and could not move my room. She didn't even offer housekeeping to come up and clean the room! Seriously lacking customer service! 

To sum everything up, the customer service here was absolutely horrible, room was dirty from a previous guest, they make you park in sketchy parking areas if their lots are full and they might not even give you the room you booked. Stay anywhere else but here during your next trip to Las Vegas. It's sad to say, but I hope they knock this place down and put up a new hotel with staff members that care about their jobs and aren't lazy like the ones I encountered during my stay.",6,2,0

This hotel and casino are analogous to the old school Vegas hotels and casinos found near the Fremont Street Experience (the Golden Nugget, Four Queens Hotel etc.) and the place felt like its 60-year age at times. 

The slots and gaming tables seemed outdated and on the smaller side. The casino did not feel as dazzling as the Palazzo or the Paris Hotel but consequently, and upon request, I was told that the rates were cheaper than most other hotels on The Strip. The flamingos were beautiful and numbered at least two dozen. As an added bonus, the rain-forest like area where the birds were held also had a black swan, a handful of ducks and a few dozen massive koi.

We stayed here back in June 2017. We, my husband and I, were going to Las Vegas for combination of Honeymoon and my husbands 40th Birthday. We invited some friends to join us. We ended up with about 20 of us there. We didnt all stay at the Flamingo. Only 6 of us did. Others stayed in time shares and other hotels. We are platinum members so we got to skip the long line, That was great. We chose the Flamingo because it was iconic. We knew it was a bit older and less expensive so we really were prepared for less fancy than other places. We were ok with that. Good thing too since our mini suite was quite run down and not very clean. Housekeeping obviously needs some training. But we didnt really mind. We had the Birthday party at Carlos and Charlies with all 20 of us. It was great and our waiter , Jason, was the best. We rented a cabana at the Go pool which was pretty nice but the mister in the cabana didnt work and just dripped water all over our stuff. Between my Husband and I and the rest of our party we spent many thousands of dollars. We had saved so we could do anything and everything we wanted and we did. It was great. At the point of getting our bags out of the room and heading down to check out I probably would have given them 4 stars. Quite pleased with the experience to this point....
And that was the point where we discovered that the staff at The Flamingo did not want us to have happy memories. At the check out kiosk we discovered a charge of just over a thousand dollars that we didnt understand. We went to the front desk and were told that someone in housekeeping had gone into our room and noticed sleeping bags and enough luggage for about 6 extra people. -First of all, our do not disturb sign was up the entire time so no one was supposed to go in there at all.-  I told her that was a lie and we wouldnt pay it. She went in the back to talk to a manager and came out with out the manager and with no solution. She called housekeeping and was told the supervisor was not available but that they had pictures to prove it. I asked to see the pictures. They never could supply them. We had to leave to catch a plane but didnt pay. We had agreed with the front desk lady that it would be left as pending until the problem was resolved. After weeks of calling and getting no returned phone calls. Total run around. They never supplied us with pictures. It was a horrible experience. We found out we could contact Ceasars Customer Service so we did. They did call us back and said the charge had been removed. No sorry, No admitting they had made a mistake. It was more like just take it off to get us to shut up. So we dropped it because the charge was removed but never made happy. We will stay at Ceasars properties but never at the Flamingo again.
I hope  it was worth it for you -Flamingo- to try to screw us out of $1000 because I can promise that no one in our 20 person party, many of which are Las Vegas regulars, or anyone any of us ever talk to about it will stay at your hotel. Ceasars is lucky that we love their other properties so much, especially Paris.",1,0,0

While we checked in we were worried we would not be able to stay on the same floor as our friends (whatever rep is available next is the one that will book your room) this young man Brian from Pittsburg heard our concern and walked over to the rep that was helping my cousins, he went out of his way to find out what floor they would be in. As he came back he notified us that we would all be in the same floor. I was soo excited when I heard the news, we normally have to beg people to do this for us.

I then heard a lot of noise from the room next door.  Gosh, I knew I had an early AM and just wanted to sleep.  I tried to fall asleep but, the sounds of the next door party quelled that.  It sounded as if they were partying in my own room!  I have partied in Vegas but, when you have an 8:00AM class, Vegas loses it's charm.  I finally drifted off and then the alarm went off. 

Again, I was beat at the end of a long day BUT, I noticed a line in the hotel lobby.  Hey, I have learned if you see a line, wait on it.  It could be something cool.  And it was!  It was Piff the Magic Dragon from America's Got Talent!  He was signing autographs with his lil dog Mr. Piffles along with photo opps, and dog holding!  It was def. was cool!  It kinda woke me up so I decided to walk around a bit.  

The February nights weren't too bad, a light jacket is needed.  I went outside and there is this gorgeous pond with coy fishies, REAL flamingos, many birds and other exotic creatures.   So its like the Zoo-mingo not Fla!  

Lots of slots and tables...I made out well at the Blackjack tables in the Margaritaville area.  I love the Linx part.  Although yes, it is outside the hotel, there are cool large flamingos (not real) you can pose with!

I had a good time but I am sure if I wasn't on business I'd have a better time.  After the first night, I slept like a baby.  No more partying next door.  The other issue was the room key card.  It got de-magnetized 3 times.  That was super annoying being on the 9th floor having to go down and go to the front desk just to get back to your room.  Luckily, there is a separate line for that so no waiting on the check-in line.",1,6,1

There was pizza boxes and empty drink glasses out side of he rooms and stayed there till the following day we left.

Went here for my birthday and had a blast. Check in was at 4pm and I got there a few minutes before, had to wait almost 30mins to get checked in. If you print your reservation and bring it with you, you are able to check in at the ""speedy check-in"" so I advise that you do this or else you will end up waiting forever like me. 

The room was very clean, pretty basic. Wood floors, nice decor, big window, cable. The bathroom needs to be updated, but it was clean to say the least. 

There was plenty to do, we went to the pool and they had a DJ, tons of people, really good music. There was a bar there called carlos and Charlie's and it had Mexican food there and it was fun, ppl dancing on the bars and free shots, good place to get daytime wasted. 

There was a pizza place located by the elevators to our rooms and when I came walking in drunk at 3am it was still open and sooo good.

One good thing about it....it's right in the center of the strip overlooking Ceasars & DBellagio, and certainly nice to take a walk from one place o to another...

First off I have found to easily enter into the casinos parking on that side of the strip there are numerous routes in from behind so that you do not get stuck on LV Blvd. Flamingos parking garage was by far the easiest I have found to enter and exit. 

The first room I was given was very nice, in fact I could tell by the smell it had been recently remodeled. Bummer the TV didn't work but they were up to the room in minutes after calling. TV was completely broken so the maintenance crew contacted the front desk who handled my transfer to another room hassle free. Big plus was the new room was overlooking Caesars! Bonus!! Strip View!!! Bed and pillows were very comfy and the bathroom was very nice and clean (but too pink for me). 

As some have complained yes it is older than a lot of the other casinos in the area. And yes the hallway carpets could stand to be replaced but then you aren't going to get a room at the Wynn for under $125 so why would anyone even compare the two? That and I do not intend to spend the night on the hallway carpet but then perhaps those that are concerned just might. 

I must say my only disappointment was the breakfast buffet. It has two lines for food with an omelet station in the center and hotcakes station on one end. Nice to have fresh pancakes instead of steam table pancakes but the layout gets very clogged up. That and the line I chose to get in was completely out of everything (bacon, eggs, potatoes) at 8:30am (and it wasn't even that busy). 

Also DO NOT buy any sundries at the large gift shop. A regular sized bag of chips that would sell for $2.99 at the grocery store cost me $5.99 and on top of that my 16oz bottle of water cost me $3. Take some extra time and head for a local CVS or Walgreen's. 

I toured the grounds and found them to be very nice and well maintained. The pool was very busy but when it is 90 degrees and the pool area is that nice then yes it will be getting used. Flamingo is also part of a large group of casinos including Caesars, Ballys and Paris so a lot of those guests will come to Flamingo's pool. I did see the dog walk area right outside the doors where you go out for the pool. It was not in any of the hallways (see previous reviews on the hotel). The housekeeping help for the most parts does not speak English... but then why would that be a surprise? If I had my dog with me his comfort area after traveling would be a priority for me and would be one of the first things I would ask the FRONT DESK STAFF about when checking in. (see previous reviews on the hotel) 

Overall for location and service I would recommend Flamingo and will keep it in mind for future visits.",3,1,1

Our room was clean, safe, sizable enough with a very comfortable king  bed with fresh white sheets. That's all we need really. Staff were helpful and efficient. We could walk down the heart of the strip and be in the heart of everything and check out all the nearby casinos and restaurants. Not sure what everyone is complaining about.

I switched rooms three times. 

The first room, in the older tower, had peeling paint, tiles falling off the wall in the bathroom, a strong sulphur smell in the water and a wall shaking noise coming through the wall that kept me awake through the night.

Room 2, in the habitat tower, wasn't much better repair. Too bad it had a cockroach family in the bathroom.

Room 3, back in the old tower, was run down but quiet. So quiet that another cockroach family decided to put a larval sac on the side of the bed so I could watch the next generation being born (pictured).

No one seemed surprised that I was sharing my rooms with cockroaches. They comped me one day of resort fees for the 'inconvenience"".

The Flamingo is visibly aging. Public areas are in disrepair, everywhere smells of cigarette smoke even if a non-smoking area, elevators are rickety and unreliable, stairwells are filthy. The staff are nice and don't  seem even a little surprised that there are roaches in the rooms.

Decided to try valet. Was rudely told by the valet person (girl whose name I don't know) that there was only valet parking if you are a ""club member"".

Check in uneventful except for a huge line and grumpy older man at the desk. Upon arriving to room found it to be not cleaned, beer cans piled up on dresser, beds stripped but not made, trash and dirt allover (pictures to be sent to corporate).

My friends were a bit skeptical because we had a manager at work warn us to NEVER EVER EVER stay at the Flamingo. Well I took the chance after reading the reviews and it was grand! 

When we were checking in online it said that we would have to wait until 6pm to check in however I showed up at 4 and they didn't mention anything and didn't charge an early check in fee. We waited in line for about 30 minutes, which is pretty standard for Vegas Strip Hotels. The front desk attendant asked if we wanted a pool view room or a strip view room. I asked, ""Which is cheaper?"" Expecting the pool view to be a little bit more. She kinda laughed, and so did my friends... I guess it's the same... I chose strip view anyway because I like looking at the lights. 

We stayed in a standard 2 queen bed room. So none of this ""GO ROOM"" stuff. The floor was linoleum, which I really enjoyed. They had a cute grey and pink rug in front of the TV. The room was clean and contemporary. The beds were decorated with these so ugly it's cute fuzzy pink rugs. Haha the window looking outside was huge! It Took up the whole wall from floor to ceiling so we had a nice view, and the curtains (PINK) were heavy blackout curtains. There is no heater\/ac unit in the room. It's just controlled air. I didn't even see a thermostat. The temp was practically perfect. I was only looking for review purposes. The bathroom was a nice size. It was large and clean. In the shower  there was a string that pulled across so that you could hang your swimsuits\/wet clothes in the bath without it getting on the floor. NICE! The beds were clean! And comfy! That is a for sure must have.

Outside there was a FLAMINGO EXHIBIT!! With ducks and the biggest freaking Koi fish I've ever seen! They were twice the size of the ducks! They also had a little pelican exhibit and a few black swans. They had a waterfall area were you could stand and take your picture and I beautiful water fountain. 

The main bad thing about this place is the pool... It was so big! And so nice! But we had to opt out because it was so full!!! There was nowhere to sit. Nowhere to stand. Nowhere to lie down to tan. Also, the pool closes at 6... This is hot Vegas we're talking about here... The pool should stay open later! Oh well... 

Checking out was such a breeze! I didn't do the express check out. I don't know why but I don't trust those... I went to the front desk to do it. Unfortunately the check in\/check out line is the exact same line... They should be fixed as well... However when I was entering the line there was a man standing at the front of the line wearing a tux with an iPod whom asked, ""May I help you?"" And I told him I was checking out. He asked my name and room number and checked me out super easy, super fast. He was really nice as well. 

All in all I'm happy we chose to stay here. The customer service wasn't bad at all and the room was nice. Just fix that major problem of the pool and you'll get a 5 star review!",1,0,0

Flamingo Las Vegas is a hotel that I can honestly say I hate is not convenient to the guest. The staff always has an excuse regardless of how bad the situation is there is no responsibility taking by the hotel whatsoever. The second room that we were in have semen and feces on the Ottoman not to mention black mold in the shower. The pool area you have to have your drivers license to get into the pool because it's open to the public which is absolutely ridiculous. Normally when I go to a pool I just bring my key and everything was great this is not the case with the flamingo Las Vegas.,0,0,0

First off, the valet is inconveniently far from the lobby. The lobby is more centrally located in the hotel but the makes it quite a walk from your car to check-in. Then there are self check-in kiosks; however after signing in after much difficulty, they just pointed us to fall in line to complete the rest of registration. So the kiosk was ultimately pointless. 

At our time of our stay, the spa entrance elevators only had one side of elevators working. Therefore there was a long wait for the elevators as the guest to elevator ratio was horrible. 

Upon entry to the room, the doors are look unkept. There are many marks and gashes on the doors. The hallways look outdated and no taken care of. Meanwhile, we were placed on a non-smoking room but the carpets smells of an ashtray. We had to call house keeping to spray the carpet, but of course it was so pungent it came back hours later. 

The perks of the room is that there is a TV in the bathroom, which is cool. There is a privacy glass sliding door. And control sliding curtains. But that's about it.

I requested items from house keeping and they said it would be sent immediately. After waiting an hour and nothing sent up, I checked in. I called back with an apologetic worker putting in another order. However after waiting another 30 minutes I called back. A man answered, saying my first call was not place. He was giving me attitude and trying to pick a fight with me. I would've been fine if he was apologetic and willing to fix the problem. Though his tone was that it was my fault. 

I would not recommend staying in this hotel. And I for sure will not be staying at the Flamingo ever again.",3,0,1

My girlfriend and I stayed in Vegas for 7 days, and we stayed at the Flamingo for the first 5 days. Naturally after reading reviews, I was curious to see how our stay would end up. Luckily we had a GO Room. Reviews for the GO Room were great, so that is one of the reasons we booked. We checked in on Monday 6\/22 around 4, which was check in time, and you immediately notice how long the check in line was. Honestly, I knew the line was going to be long, and it definitely was, but it honestly moved a lot faster than I thought it would. While my girlfriend stood in line to check in, I went to the Total Rewards desk to retrieve my card. After upgrading to the Platinum card, we were told we can go to a separate check in\/out line for platinum (+) members only. My girlfriend was almost to the front, but we went to the platinum check in anyways, and I'm glad we did. We immediately walked up to the counter and got our room. Like I stated earlier, we got a GO room with a strip view so that is what we expected. After asking for a good view, the check in lady happily made sure we had a good view, and she also upgraded us to one of the larger GO rooms. We were so thrilled about it. 

We were located on the 28th floor, which was the very top unless you had a suite or anything along those lines. We knew about the elevator situation due to reading reviews, so we knew what we were about to face. Depending on the elevator, it can either stop on some random floors, the roof can shake, the buttons could release themselves and cause you to miss your floor, but HONESTLY it wasn't a major concern for us. It's not like the elevators drop on you, and you're gonna die. If anything they were a good ice breaker between other Vegas goers while we were heading up floors. 

The Go room was exactly what we ordered and wanted. The bed was so comfortable, the drawer space and counter space was perfect, and the fridge worked great. The bathrooms had the TV installed, a good sized shower and a one person tub, the counter space was also very good. Everything in the room was very clean, and I didn't notice any stains. My girlfriend really enjoyed the full body mirror in the room. Opening the curtains to our view is a moment I would remember. Our view was so awesome! Perfect view of the Bellagio fountain show and the hotels in the middle of the strip like the Aria, Cosmo, Paris, And Bally's. One of my favorite parts of the room was the couch next to the window. My girlfriend and I really enjoyed laying on there together enjoying the view while talking about our plans for the day. Only small downfall about our particular room was that the A\/C was acting up. It would work fine for awhile, then it wouldn't, but it wasn't too big of a deal since our room was at a comfortable temp. 

The casino was a perfect size, I actually remembered it a little larger, but I guess I over-estimated it. It had a great amount of slots and table games. The cocktail waitresses came around to us quite frequently while we were gambling so that was great. When we felt like a change of scenery all we had to do was walk out the door and we could immediately be in the Cromwell or the Linq. The Flamingo also had access to the Monorail system, which we like to use if we wanted to go up and down the strip. Even if we wanted to walk the strip, whether if we went left or right outside of our hotel, we had plenty of places to go. 

The parking garage was a bit of a pain the first time. First couple of floors were for valet only, and there were a bit of spots for Flamingo Hilton guests and car rental spots. The only time I was getting a little frustrated was our first venture through the structure, but in the end we found a spot near the top. We used that parking garage a lot those couple of days and we always found a spot. Although, most were near the top, we didn't mind it at all. We also used valet a couple times and most of those times we were told it'll be about 10-15 minutes for our car to come up. They never over exceeded that time limit, if anything, our car got to us faster than the limit. 

Overall, our stay at the Flamingo was awesome. After staying in the GO room, I will never want to stay in any other room below that level just because we loved it so much. I would recommend staying in one of those rooms. Unfortunately our stay at the Flamingo wasn't the full week, but we had a great time at that hotel, and my girlfriend and I can't wait to be back in there again!",9,1,2

Pros:

Location ~ The location is superb. It's sandwiched between the Imperial Palace and Bally's and is right across the street from Caesars. Couldn't get any closer to the action.

View from your room ~ Even though we didn't get a room with a view of the strip, we had the next best thing: a view of the Flamingo's beautiful gardens. Very pretty!

Noise level ~ I thought the room we had was very quiet. I'm a rather light sleeper and have to sleep with a sound machine at home, but I didn't have a problem with noise while staying at the Flamingo. That could also be because I drank heavily while I was there, but that's beside the point.

Room rate ~ I thought the cost of the room for Wednesday through Friday nights was very reasonable. 

Cons: 

Check-in ~ We waited 45 minutes to check-in to the hotel. That's unacceptable! There were two clerks working at the front desk checking people in, and that was definitely not enough. Wouldn't they rather have people out in the casino gambling than waiting in line to check in?!?! It doesn't make any sense! They were way understaffed.

Rooms ~ I know all the rooms have been ""updated,"" but I didn't think they were all that nice. Instead of having carpeting, as most hotel rooms do, our room had some type of laminate flooring that resembled hardwood. Perfect for cleaning up spills and vomit! The bathroom was super-tiny. The door barely cleared the toilet seat. Also, the bathroom didn't look like it had been updated at all. Old tile, old vanity. Not very modern.

Cab service ~ When we went to leave on Saturday afternoon, there were no cabs downstairs! None! Nada! Zip! Zilch! A huge line of people were waiting for a cab. Ridiculous! I don't know if all the cabs were picking up people from the fancier hotels and weren't going to hotels like the Flamingo, but it was a cabbie ghost town there.

Seriously, the view from our room, the walking distance to everything, and the easy access to the strip made staying at the Flamingo well worth it. Also worth noting - the pool was pretty great and our room had ""hardwood floors"" which was nice. The room overall felt pretty clean but the bathroom was not as tidy. 

Cons: 
Sheets were rough and probably ridiculously old. 
Bathroom left a lot to be desired. Very basic and old. 
Bed itself wasn't awful but the sheets\/comforter\/pillows were.
Walls are paper thin - you will hear your neighbors watching tv and\/or sexing.

I wouldn't necessarily stay at the Flamingo again, but I don't regret staying there for our first time in Vegas. We had a blast and we were more than comfortable enough in our room. If a good location for an unbeatable price is what you want, the Flamingo has it.",0,0,0

When we returned to speak with the checkin receptionist she was vague and told us to take another lift. Our keys would then not work for the room and our toilet continued to run most of the night.

The room: The Fab room I was in was pretty average. Vinyl floors, decent linens, and a bathroom that hasn't been updated in 30 years. The upside is the rooms are fairly good sized. The downside is you can hear your neighbors, so when the party crowd comes in from LA on the weekend you hear all of it. What evens it out is they consistently have the lowest rates on this part of the strip, so you can be in the middle of everything. But don't expect the same quality of Caesars Palace for that dirt cheap rate.

The food: abysmal. The coffee shop remains closed, so the only breakfast choices before 7AM is the food court. Not optimal if you need to be somewhere by 8. Otherwise, the buffet opens at 7, Carlos & Charlies and Margaritaville open at 8. Carlos & Charlie's is terrible. Margaritaville is good but pricey. I ate at the steakhouse bar one night and wasn't very impressed. Depending upon the night it's not hard to pay more for breakfast or dinner than you did for your room. Better food choices are next door at The Linq.

The casino: drink service was fairly good, but the slots are tighter than they used to be.

Observations: The elevators are a study in how the place is run. They're old and worn out. So in the past year they've started to re-do the interior, using a Formica that's inexpensive but should wear fairly well. But they didn't do the front panels of the cars, so with very few exceptions you're looking at a 20 year old button panel that's been scrubbed down one too many times with several buttons that don't work and the whole thing rattles and makes you question whether it will work or not. You wish they would just do it right and completely re-do the elevators (in contrast, Caesars completely overhauled the scary Imperial Palace elevators and now they're modern, fast, and look great) but instead they try to incrementally fix things on the cheap.

Tips: use the self check-in kiosk to save time. You can check out on the internet using your smart phone, which saves more time. The earlier in the day you check in, the better your chance of not getting a lousy room, but if you're in at a low rate, you'll probably get a view of a wall or the air conditioning unless you pay for an upgrade.

Overall, the two things that made me the most angry comes down to what they did to food and beverage and the elevators. If I could get someone to wait on me without having to dress up after 9PM or if I wanted breakfast before 7 that wasn't served on paper plates and could get it at the Flamingo, I'd feel a whole lot better than I do.

The front desk agent was pretty nice as was the Total Rewards agent.  Everyone you pass in the hall always says hello and smiles, which is nice to see.  The food at the pool is surprisingly good and the drinks aren't weak.  The pool is crowded as others have said but you can find chairs if you search around or if you go to the smaller pool above the Go Pool.   The waterfalls in the Go Pool are awesome and so much fun.  The only real cons are: Buffet is terrible, service at buffet isn't great, and they only include one device for internet per day with the resort fee.  If you want others on wifi, you have to pay $14-30 a day\/device.  This seems astronomical and kind of defeats the purpose of an inexpensive room.  It's not a huge deal but also the AT&T reception in the room is bad so if you need to rely on cell reception to be online you might not like the wifi policy here.  That said, the room is super quiet and kind of like a cocoon so if you are looking to have a nice room to relax in, get some sun, and be close to other things on the strip, this is a good place (and the birds\/flamingos are cute!).",0,0,0

So I can't park my car until I got to the 5th floor.

The check in line was long and I wanted to make sure I get the room that I want so I had to wait in  line, otherwise i Could have use the kiosk. I asked for the non smoking room that has the fastest elevator because I cannot be late to class. The room was partially updated with a small, clean but very beat up bathroom. No problem. Immediately I unpacked my bag and started to wipe down the room, the light switch, counter surface, tv remote and the wipe pick up a lot of dirts. I carefully did a visual inspection of the bed, under the pillow and the bed sheet and found no hair or spot, that's a good sign at least they changed the bed sheet.

I stayed here earlier in the year, and had a gift certificate for a FREE room for two nights in December. When I called to book my FREE room for December 14 and 15, I was told the price for the FREE room was $56. When I questioned paying $56 for a FREE room, I was told the room was in fact FREE, but the fees involved totaled $56.

Personally, I consider the ""resort"" fee of $25 per night charged by the Flamingo to be a junk fee and I won't pay it. 

Caution: Make sure and look carefully at the small print when booking a reservation at the Flamingo. Like a FREE lunch, a FREE room is not FREE at the Flamingo.

With all it's history and long-time establishment on the Strip, I feel really mean giving this hotel a surly review, but in true Yelp fashion a girl's gotta keep it real.

Let it be known that I am no Vegas hotel snob.  I don't expect to stay at the Wynn or the Bellagio every trip to Vegas and I'm perfectly okay with Stratosphere, Excalibur, or any other middle-of-the-line choices.  My boyfriend and I stayed at the Flamingo for a friend's military graduation ceremony that was taking place in one of the convention rooms this past weekend.  The rate was military discounted, so we took it.  The convention room itself was nice, the food was decent.  The location on the strip is also a plus for the Flamingo.

But...the hotel rooms themselves were outdated, cheesy, and not impressive to say the least. Granted, I should say that we stayed in the older part of the hotel, and not one of the updated or renovated rooms- judging from the pictures that other Yelpers have posted, the new rooms look a helluva lot better than the old ones we saw (friend's suite) and stayed in.

We stayed on the 27th floor ""Executive Floor"" as the guy at the desk told us.  I knew that the Flamingo had been sitting on the strip since forever, so I was expecting an older, not-that-bougie hotel, even though we were supposed to be staying on the nicer floors.  Even at that, I was disappointed when we saw our room.   In short, the room could be described as drab, confusing, and almost depressing.  Like a senior citizen home, or something.  Like they tried to make the room look good with decor that had no common theme or common sense whatsoever.

 There was a large, sketch-looking stain on the side of the bed, and the bathroom....don't get me started.  It needed serious renovation- there was paint chipping off  the walls and a dirty-looking mustard yellow (hello, 1975) shower curtain that stuck to the railing at the top.  The water pressure was weaker than a faucet in a kitchen sink and the lighting was dim and...did I already mention the word depressing?  The bath towels were HALF the size of the towels we have at home, and we bought our cheap bath towels from Burlington Coat Factory.  Need I say more?

I know, it sounds harsh.  But it's all true.  I wished we had stayed in the updated, renovated rooms- maybe our experience would have been better.  The casino itself is alright, Margaritaville looked fun but we didn't drink there, and the pool looked pretty cool too, although jam packed with people (what can you expect in June, though).  The bar called Sin City Brewery, inside the Flamingo near the pool area, was really good.  Their light beer was yummers!  But that's for a separate review.

Ultimately, this is VEGAS, I get it- where getting drunk to get drunk is totally okay, if not encouraged.  I'm down!  But i shouldn't need to get drunk just to escape the depression that echoes off the walls of our ""Executive"" hotel room.  For real.",0,0,0

I stayed here in August for four nights and I was looking forward to staying at the flamingo since I heard everything was recently refurbished. I stayed in a 'go deluxe' room on the 3rd floor....

They must not have refurbished this floor yet, I leave the elevator and the carpet is filthy and lifting in some areas. Then I think, well the room will be nice I'm sure... Haha what a joke! They were nothing like the photos online. I hate to say it but the rooms were nicer at the Luxor and Excalibur. Also there was a door that connected my room to the room next door, ew. The furniture was scuffed and chipped and had clearly had much much better days. So I think, well, I bet the view is beautiful!..

Until I opened the curtains and saw a cement wall just a few feet from my window. 

And I thought to myself, well it can't get worse than this... But then I looked into the bathroom. Ah, black mold around the tub is simply just what my vacation needed. 

So I learned the hard way and it's my fault for actually thinking the flamingo would be a nice place to stay especially for booking even after I had heard some terrible things.

I will never ever stay here again. You literally could not pay me. 

That was just the room, that doesn't include the terrible service I received nor the maid walking in multiple times even when the 'do not disturb' sign was on my door.  

So I would literally stay anywhere else in las Vegas but here. I recommend for lower budget trips Excalibur and the luxor, the rooms are clean and I never had any problems. I would also recommend Caesars (right across the street!) It's really lovely and in a great location. These are the only hotels in las Vegas that I have been to, and can vouch for and when I return for another vacation you can rest assured I will never return here.",0,0,0

1. Recently remodeled\/ upgraded hotel (not swanky--just think an janky old hotel with new floors, decor, tv, and furniture. Be warned--the bathrooms seem to have been left off the remodel list. Old shower\/ bath\/ fixtures\/ toilet. Our sink was actually leaking. 

2. Clean. No carpet in the the super basic rooms, so I actually feel it's cleaner than one with carpet. Linens were new-ish and still white. No down comforters. Just pink throws that looked like a Muppet was skinned. 

3. Location. Center of the strip, basically. Quick-ish walk to Miracle Mile Mall, PH, Cosmo\/ Marquee, etc. 

4. Mediocre pizza place right next to the elevators. Umm...can we say, lifesaver?? 

5. And my favorite...Cost. This place is cheap! We expected a LOT less when we booked, but ended up loving the Flamingo by the end of the weekend. 

Perfect spot for a quicky (cheap!) trip to Vegas with a small group of friends! Will definitely be back whenever we're not trying to pretend we be fancy. Ha!

The room was newly decorated and huge.  It was very clean, included a fridge, a couch, table, a king bed with the most comfortable pillows and comforters I've ever felt in any hotel, and there was even a TV built into the mirror in the bathroom.  I watched the Olympics while taking a bath- awesome.  There is a large flat screen in the living room area and another one next to the bed that pulls out and you can adjust where to put in.  The view looked over the entire pool area. No rooms are facing each other so it's very private.  It also must be very sound proof because I don't remember hearing anything outside of the room while in it. One last note about the room is that it's open concept.  If you want to get together with friends before heading out this room is a perfect place to host (more seating on the over-sized modern couch at the end of the bed).

The 21+ pool area was lots of fun.  Go early if you want a chair though because guests that stay at Bill's can also use the pool so it fills up quick.

The only reason I left a star off was that the hallways could use a paint job & one morning we picked up some fruit there that was frozen\/spoiled.

I thought the hotel had a great location (right in the middle of the strip, even in 105 degree weather it wasn't too bad walking towards the Venetian or Planet Hollywood). The rooms were also nice, nothing super fancy but the rooms were very clean and modern. Hotel was also quiet and the pool was very relaxing. There is also a monorail station directly behind the hotel which was very convenient also. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

Service: Good. Checked in early and got a decent room on the 12th floor. The hotel staff was courteous and friendly. 

Price: Pretty cheap for a room. I think I paid around $65-75 per night for a room. They also have their new GO rooms which you can upgrade to for an additional $30+ per night after you reserve a room.

The key kiosk procedure should be improved to make it more productive and after all I went through the worker forgot to give me my key with all the unwanted paperwork she gave me so I had to go all the way back! They downgraded my room and didn't even tell me. The outdated elevators stop at floors for no reason and only 70% of them were working. The pool workers searched everybody's belongings looking for food and water and made the guests feel like terrorists. The buffet is only open for breakfast during weekdays, imagine all the extra business they would get it they were open for lunch and dinner. At 430 in the morning a worker started up his leafblower to clean the massive garden so I called the front desk and asked him to have the employee stop waking everybody up.

We like the location, the pools, and until lately the value.  The Flamingo was one of the last hotels on the strip to charge a ""resort fee.""

    Fitness center access for two people per day.
    Daily in-room internet access for two devices.
    All local calls.

REALLY? I don't go to Las Vegas to use a fitness center. Who would make local calls from a hotel room when everyone has a cell phone. So internet is the only thing. I would rather pay for it if I need it. Notice that it doesn't say access to the pool?  That's because on Saturday there is an additional $10.80 per person to use the big pool. I forgot to mention that the ""resort fee"" is now $32.48 per day. So now that $150.00 per night room will cost you $226.56 (with tax) for two if you want to use the big pool.

My husband and I were rarely in our room other than to literally catch 2 or 3 hours of sleep.  If that is your type of trip, then the Flamingo is perfect. Nothing fancy, nothing dumpy - just right to run in and out of.

A few complaints, the room wasn't the nicest room I've ever had. At least the view was okay, we overlooked the pool area and had a great view of scenery being 25 floors up.  The bathroom left much to be desired, and no fridge? Come on!  Housecleaning did not stop in one day at all, our trash was overflowing as well as our dirty towels, which was pretty disgusting.  The hallways also were a bit on the dingy side - wouldn't walk barefoot that's for sure.  I also swear someone pooped on the floor at one point, the smell was horrendous and I swear I saw a blob of poop.  

You can also hear your neighbors to easily and all of the noise in the hallway.Which is fine, but sometimes enough is enough.  We were also told we couldn't upgrade, however we saw people in the elevator and overheard them talking about the room they were switching to. (LIES)

I also did not like the haul from the lobby to our room. lugging my heavy suitcase, it was a pain in the neck!!!

Our room was on the 28th floor with a great view to the south of the Bellagio fountains and City Center. I like that there is a refrigerator in the room and motorized curtains that you can control bedside. After the first night, we did not receive service to our room even though when we left, the cart was next door and they were providing service to our neighbors which speaks to the laziness of our housekeeper. The Spa elevators are convenient to the parking deck, pool, and to southern entrances\/exits of the casino.

For the drivers, the parking deck is a mess. The later you get there, the less chance you have  of finding a spot. On the weekends, expect the deck and valet to be full if you don't get there early enough. On the upper floors of the parking deck there are some sections marked ""valet""  that guests can park so look for those areas if you're having trouble finding a spot.

The pools are a strong positive for the Flamingo. The GO pools are for the adults and the Beach Club pool is family friendly. Look for the bridge to cross over to the Beach Club pool where you present your key for entrance. Get there early to get your chair and enjoy a dip in the pool or take a ride down the two level slide.

I wouldn't recommend one restaurant in the hotel except Margaritaville to have a drink and people watch. Just put on the walking shoes because your center Strip location can get you to a nice restaurant in 15 minutes.

The poker room in Flamingo has always been one of my favorites. It's a great place to meet people from all over the country to chat and maybe have a shot or two. More importantly, it's a chance to win some easy money off an unsuspecting donkey or an inebriated player that can't see straight let alone make a smart decision.

Because I was on a budget (I wanted to spend all my money on food) on my most recent trip to Vegas I decided to find the best hotel deal while still being in the middle of all the action. After lots of searching, Flamingo provided my wife and I the best deal.

We checked in on a Wednesday evening and checked out on a Sunday. For all those days in one of their Fab Deluxe rooms with hardwood floors, a king size bed with an extra soft pillow top and a HD flat screen TV, it only cost us around $340 or so. Not a bad deal at all considering it was the week of Valentine's Day. I wasn't too happy about the $14 a day charge for the wi-fi and the fact that our room didn't have a fridge but I got over it pretty quickly.

Stayed here 4 nights in July 2013.

For check-in, you have the choice of a slow-moving line to get to a person or you can use the kiosk. The kiosk had no line so we used that, but had to repeat several steps and get assistance from a helpful staff member to get the keys to print out. I am not sure this saved any time over the regular line.

Hotel keys failed twice, requiring security to get back into the room and fix the card reader, taking over 90 minutes both times. There seems to be only one security guy and one repairman for the entire hotel, judging by the wait. My fiance laid down and took a nap in the hallway while we were waiting since the first time this occurred was late at night after we returned from the club.

The room had no bathtub and it was not so much a shower stall, but what I called a prison shower, with a curtained-off corner of the bathroom. There was no border, so it was really easy for the water to run off into the rest of the bathroom. If you are a ""bath"" person, it is truly disappointing to not have use of a bathtub during your vacation. However, I'm not sure how to avoid this type of room as I don't recall the kiosk asking about this option. I prefer a hotel bathroom to smell of cleaning products or have no odor. This one had a faint dirty smell, as if it had only been wiped down and not thoroughly cleaned.

There is no ""chill"" pool, only a ""party"" pool. What if you want to just have a relaxing day by the pool in between partying? You can't.

We asked for one more night as our flight was at 10pm,  and they wanted to charge $120 after discussing on the phone it would be $45 thirty minutes earlier. I won't pay that much after experiencing substandard service. We switched to Linq for an extended stay at $88 and we wished we chose the Linq hotel for the weekend. The fridge was available without additional costs to store our drinks and food, and the bathroom was clean and updated so the sight of bad caulking was nonexistent.

Then then switched us to another room thought things would be much better. Wow was I wrong this room was even worse. 
The room was also not cleaned very well either. There were toe nail clippings on the carpet and floor. Then off to the bathroom I go and there is no toilet paper roll holder. I was astonished that these simple repairs were not taken care of and they were still placing people in these rooms. I could have fixed that issue within 2 minutes. So finally I went down to the desk to have them move is once again. The gentleman Brian (tall white guy from I think the Midwest) at the front desk moved us to another room and was very nice.

We stayed at the Monte Carlo in July and there was a noticeable advantage to Flamingo : 24 hour food court!!!

Casino had $3 bubble craps and a range of black jack mins... their roulette dealer told my hun that she wasn't responsible for keeping track of the bets... (wut?) So he cashed out asap.

They have penny hundred-line video poker that treated us well. 

BUFFET = COMPLETE CRAP. But you'll eat there anyway.... but trust me, crap. (for reference we have also eaten at the Bellagio's buffet but preferred Ellis Island prime rib.)

We were going to Vegas for a long weekend to hang out at a pool and didn't want to spend a ton of money on a hotel.  I've stayed at the more elite casinos and we just wanted a low key hangout.

The GO pool did not disappoint.  You do have to get there early to get a chair, but if you don't, its so hot, setting your towel on the side of the pool and grabbing a shallow cove to hang out in all day is just fine.  

Our room was good.  Not great, not terrible.  We did upgrade to a GO room for $22 more a night and I assume it was worth it because it was really nicely decorated.  Free safe, big bathroom, nice bed and white pleather headboard and a great view of the strip.

There is construction going on next door so some of the foot and car traffic is rerouted, but no big deal.

There was a long time to check in but we walked right up to the kiosk and checked in on the computer in about 2 minutes.  Same thing with checkout.  

We had them hold our bags downstairs at the bell hop because we checked out at noon for a 4PM flight - they did a great job with no lines.  There are lines for baggage upstairs on the main lobby.

We were doing a 7 night trip and decided to spend 4 nights at the flamingo so we could tackle mid and north strip areas those nights and 3 nights at excalibur to tackle the south strip those nights.  The last time I stayed at flamingo we had a standard room with an awesome view and it was not a dissapointment.  That was two years ago and we had not been back yet.  With so many poor reviews we felt we hit the jackpot and should leave it at that.  But with it being summer time and wanting to split the time between two sides of the strip my love for the flamingos pool left me coming back to them.  So I booked a go room this time figuring we were checking in Saturday evening they would have given any decent standard rooms away by that point and I didn't want to end up with one of the worn down ones.  So we arrive at about 8 pm to my surprise absolutely no line at all to check in at all.  I was already feeling lucky at that point.  So when we go to check in the guy is looking us up and tells me that you've been upgraded.  I figured how does that work when I already booked a go room so I asked. He told me that we were put in the room that is up from that and that it is an amazing room ten times better than a go room, and how they only give that room away for one night, and how lucky I was to get it for 4 nights.  I figure ok he's just milking it now, and it can't be anything too special.  So we go up and actually pass by the room looking for the number and then say where is the room.  We go back and notice the number is on two doors that look seriously like where the laundry carts would go through.  We braced ourselves and opened up the doors to the sickest two bedroom suite I have ever had.  It was a go room in the bedroom and then a living room with another bathroom, couch, 50 inch plasma, dining area, etc.  It was ridiculous.  I was so psyched.  Needless to say it was awesome.  It was so nice to have basic things you're not used to in a vegas room like a empty fridge, coffee maker, but loved having the extra room and extra bathroom.  

Everything else about the flamingo was standard as always.  Tight slots as everywhere else, and a fantastic pool.

Our flight landed at 930 Monday night when we arrived to check in we were hounded multiple times by staff trying to get us to do activities we had to keep saying no we just want to check in. Finally after 20 min they let us go. We waited 40 min to finally check in and at employee told us there wasn't really a room (then why was I able to book?) so we said is there anything we just wanted to sleep from long day of flying so he gave us a handicap room said to call at 9am to get a new room. Fine. The bathroom and room was so dirty and smelled. View of the roof. Connecting rooms, neighbor was up all night coughing out a lung, walls so thin I heard Him all night and didn't get any sleep. The next day we called at 9 am like they said, told us to call back at 11 when check out is. Stopped what we were doing at 11 to call, they said they didn't have anything to come in the later afternoon for the new room.  So after being pushed around we went back to the hotel at like 4 and the lady at the desk said there is no rooms available for us, we asked if she's sure she said 99.9%, I even explained again for the fourth time that they told me I could get a new room, finally a manager came by and I saw them whispering and finally the manager said to just give us a new one. So I chimed in with oh thought there was nothing. Second room was just as big as a dump. This time looked over the pool. Shower had mold on the wall and the vent were covered in dust. Bed was very lumpy. Mirrors dirty. AC wasn't working.  In the elevators wires were seen. Even on the outside of one it was de attached from the wall.

We had a standard room, not the ""Go"" Room, and we were prepared for less than what we actually had. I was pleasantly surprised with the size of the room. The bed was comfortable, the decor was average. But I came in with that expectation so I wasn't let down. 

My only pet peeve is that the bathroom doesn't have a fan. This was also the case at the Monte Carlo, so I'm wondering if it's the norm? 

Only one night did we hear people outside our room. The rest of the time it was quiet.

We love the location. Center Strip, Monorail stop, and right across the street from Caesars. You can't beat the location.

The casino is fine. Compared to Bally's or Imperial Palace, it's a definite improvement. Of course compared to something like Wynn, Bellagio, Venetian etc it's not much. It's not horrendously smoky, but it's not as ""fresh"" as the aforementioned.

Our rates were exceptional and I love that there are no resort fees. The Wildlife Habitat is a nice little place to walk through, and I love that there is an 18+ pool.

Check in was a breeze - used the automated kiosks. There were 50 people in line for regular check-in, and no one at the kiosks. C'mon people, live a little - it's easy! Check out was also a breeze. Did the fast pass check out and just turned in the card to the check out box.

The room: it is a decent sized room, but for a business traveler, poorly appointed. A simple desk with only one extra outlet in the wall to charge electronics. A hard, straight-backed chair is the seating option. The only decent seating option in the room as it turns out. The size of the room allows for a chaise lounge. No back; a lot more like a bench than a chaise. After a long day on my feet trudging around a conference I would have appreciated a decent armchair to sit in.

Nice room that is clean, spacious and considered the ""standard"" room. I couldn't have been happier with my choice. Upon my arrival for the SECOND visit. Things started off quite poorly to say the least. 
      Got in at 2 pm and tried to check in early but was told check in was at 4pm. Not a problem, I was expecting that anyway. Go to the pool while we wait because it is hot as hell! Change into my bathing suit hop in the pool and immediately land straight on an aluminum beer cap, which slices my foot. I immediately grab my foot because I can tell it cut pretty good. I call for a lifeguard while I am in the pool (still putting pressure on it to avoid bleeding in the pool). I tell her I cut my foot and she, in such a belittling way says ""Ohhhh, you cut your foot?"" ( with an awww poor baby look on her face). I then say yes, lift my foot out of the water and take the pressure off. It immediately starts gushing blood and then she starts to gag. She then proceeds to bark at me to not let any blood get in the water. Uhhhh, kind of hard considering I need to get out of the pool with one foot and a hand to keep pressure on and you are just standing there staring. She then leaves to get someone else. That person arrives, looks at my foot and then says the same thing ""Uhh hold on, let me get someone else."" This repeats three more times, I kid you not! 
       I finally get fed up and just say to one the lifeguards ""Look, if you don't know what to do that's fine, but please just find someone who is qualified to tell me if I need stitches."" That so called person arrives and asks if I would like an ambulance, I say no and he just walks away. The BS continues and I go to the front desk to complain to a manager. I tell him that beer caps shouldn't be allowed near the pool and tell him how upset I am that I just arrived and now have a really bad cut conveniently places on the bottom of my foot for my trip to Vegas. He couldn't look any more bored and just says okay well there is nothing I can do but we have upgraded your room. What an upgrade. This room was half the size of the room I had the last time I was there, smelled like cat piss outside of the room and WREAKED of weed when we got inside.

I only decided to stay here because my cousin wanted to stay here and we were all doing a big trip and just wanted to not be a hassle to walk to a different hotel every day.  Booked this room on Black Friday of 2013. The deal was good! I kept calling then since then till about June to make sure everything is okay and make some changes since I decided to stay longer. (YES I WAS IN VEGAS FOR 7 DAYS NEVER AGAIN) lol. Anyways so I get a email from total rewards about 2 weeks before my stay for a room up grade. So instead of being in my go room with two beds and strip view I upgraded to a 2 bed in a mini suite. The total was $1234 for 7 nights. Not bad...right? So we get there and check in. My party of 3 was there when I was checking in and I ask the Filipino lady with short hair who was working June 17 between 10pm-11pm and she said twice to me $1234 so of course in there diving the total so I can get the amount from the 2 other people.  And the $200 something incidental charges. And we would get reimbursed if nothing was wrong in thee room.  I was upset she never mentioned if the hotel gave me a credit for staying there towards maybe restaurants or anything in Vegas. Which I did apparently, look through my emails. Partly might fault I should have read my emails before going. HOWEVER my boyfriend works at a hotel and they tell all their guest about all the freebies. I'm not trying to be cheap but it would have been nice to be informed that. So we get request a roll out bed. She actually was nice to tell us that we would get it at no charge and we should have it soon in the room. We actually went out and got drinks and we got to our room by like 11pm and my boyfriend went out and he got back before I did which was 1am and STILL NO EXTRA BED. He actually had to call and remind them. So we get to the room and I look around the bathroom is pretty dark.... They need a light in the shower or something. I look online what the room would look like it said we would have a tv in the bathroom...NOPE! No fridge, no microwave and no strip view oh and a dinosaur tv. My cousin had a go room with a nicer tv. I was shocked. I paid more and I get a shitty room. The housekeeping wasn't good. The 6nights I think they only cleaned it 2-3 maxed? Not only that my boyfriend was for the idea to tip the house keepers. They have a job why should we tip them especially if they don't do there job right. We actually ran out of toilet paper one night and had to tissue paper. We cleaned the trash can out and had to use that to put beers in with ice as a nice chest. The next day we get to the elevator and the button in the 21st on the right side facing the window was broken like stuck inside, I mean you can still use it but that was just not acceptable. So the second night I leave my wristlet in the cab yes that is my fault but I walked to lost and found and they basically told me it takes 5-6hrs to look at the tapes so they can say what cab company I was riding with. So they just gave me a list and I called and left a message but no return. So I decided to go back Friday morning and see if maybe they found it. 2 employees were in the hallway as I was waiting for someone at lost and found to help me. I knocked twice and no one opened the door. I pick up the phone and it's ringing and finally an answer. I was so upset that I lost my wallet with ALL MY MONEY AND CREDIT CARDS AND DEVIT CARD. Yes being in Vegas with no form of money is TERRIBLE. So I really wished they could have helped me but the guy that answered said no one returned nothing and I told him ""I'm here till Tuesday the 24 can you look at the video from June 18."" And the guy said ""umm yeah I don't think no one is going to want to do that right now cause we have other things to do than look at the videos"" EXCUSE ME IM IN VEGAS AND IM WITHOUT MONEY. I'm paying for my room just like everyone why can't you help me? And I'm actually telling you, you have like 3 days. Do you really have to be a jerk and say that? I leave because I am beyond mad in his response. I give at this point and don't even bother with it cause I had all my stuff expedited. So we finally check out and everything was decent.  However today 1 day later (today) I forward my boyfriend the hotel stay and it's $1533. WHERE THE HELL DID THESE CHARGES COMES FROM THE LADY SAID IT WAS $1234. Looking at the charges, I was never aware of a resort fee. And not only that it looks like the deposit I paid wasn't applied. And then that stupid charge. AND WE DIDNT GET THE  INCIDENTAL DEPOSIT BACK.  We didn't break, steal, or damage anything.I am so upset with this hotel currently waiting on a call from josh the manager and she what they can do because I am furious.

I had originally called Ceasar's who stated that the they were booked for an event. Since i have been part of the Ceasar's reward plan for years I asked about one of their other properties. My request had a few very important needs.
2 room with 2 Queen Beds
A great pool that was kid friendly
Non-smoking
They recommended the Flamingo, I was very skeptical but they assured me I would be in the ""Go Room"" a room that was completely upgraded and beautiful.
The rooms were nice in appearance, but that is where it all stopped.
1. They failed to tell me the kids pool was only partially open. ""All the wonderful features they described were closed"". The pool deck was so small that every single chair and Chaise Lounge was taken by 10am. The pool was filled with people. Literally could not find a spot to sit or get down the steps of the pool because it was so packed. We were told by staff only the section would be open until Labor Day. So reservations sent me to a pool that was closed when this was @ the top of my list.
2. Walked into our 1st room and the toilet was plugged. Engineer stated they had been having problems with the toilet. Hmmm really why would they put us in a room that had toilet issues.
3. No hot water to shower, called engineering they said to run the water for 15 minutes. We did the water was still cold. We called again and they said we were the only room complaining. But they would send someone. We waited 1 hour then called and they said they did not need us to wait they would check into the issue. At this point we left and the elevator was packed everyone was upset over it... Wait they said I was the only room with an issue... Stayed 3 nights and every morning the hot water was an issue. It was hit and miss whether you got a hot or cold shower.
4. Day 2 we decided to leave our room and shower later, housekeeping entered our room and stole a Military ID badge. We contacted security took them over an hour to come to the room. We explained that this badge could be used for illicit purposes. They interviewed the first maid and all good. They said not did not think it was her. The 2nd maid that entered the room just so happened to go home sick a few minutes after she was alerted of the interview. ""sound suspicious...Yep... they said we should just kiss it good bye""
5. The room was converted to a non-smoking room. Yes to a non-smoker it smelled terrible.
6. The elevators are so old and jumps a lot. Plan extra time to go up and down the elevator they are very old and slow. Also you may need to wait a while to get one that is not packed with people.
After waiting for 45 minutes for a manager all I received was a well we are sorry but since you already had an upgrade all I can do is credit you for one night credit of my resort fee..$32.48.
Wait what upgrade.. I booked a go room... Oh the upgrade was I was able to book a Go Room because of my loyalty.

04\/04\/2016 AMERICAN EXPRESS-LODGING 640.47

This is what I paid for each room for 3 nights so not exactly a cheap stay... Wait I did get a $32.48 credit....

The main reason to stay at this hotel is because it is right in the middle of the strip in the most convenient location, and you don't pay the price of the more posh hotels located around it.  Nothing really special about it except for the convenience and the price.  You can experience the other hotels that are a short walk across the street or next door.  (Caesars is directly across the street and only took a few minutes to walk there.)  I've stayed at other hotels in Vegas, including Caesars and Palazzo, and although these hotels are *way* more luxurious, the price and location of the Flamingo make it an affordable and sensible alternative.  We got a good deal off expedia.com for airfare and hotel, which included a $30 resort credit (which we used at the buffet- don't waste it on this, as the Paradise Garden Buffet wasn't all that great) and a 2-for-1 show ticket deal, which we didn't end up using.

Don't let the age of the hotel fool you, although it is an older hotel, it doesn't look or smell like it.  I'm always afraid of staying at older hotels because of this, and was pleasantly surprised!  No mildew smell or anything, even in the rooms that aren't renovated!  It was also very clean, even the bathrooms!  We stayed in an older room at first and then upgraded to a renovated room just for the experience, NOT because there was something wrong with the older room.  The newer room had a flat screen TV, a more comfortable bed (pillow top!) and an updated bathroom with a TV in the mirror!  The older room was just a regular hotel room, with no bells and whistles.

The only complaint I have is that the walls are very thin, even in the renovated room (which was so pretty though!  very modernized!), I could hear the muffled voices of men talking next door early in the morning.  Not good for your neighbors if you are staying in a group! 

The casino is ok, just a normal casino, but I don't gamble very much so I'm not the expert in this area.  We ate at a few places at this hotel, at the Paradise Garden Buffet (see above) and Voga, their higher-end ""italian"" restaurant that is open for only a few hours in the evening.  I am planning to do seperate reviews of these, so stay tuned.  

Overall I would definitely reccomend the Flamingo hotel if you are on a budget, but still want to experience the Vegas Strip without having to Cab it everywhere!  Try the renovated room if you want to have a more luxury experience.",1,0,1

Below was my original post concerning Flamingo.

We travel to Vegas a few times a year, and after many years of avoiding it, we decided to give Flamingo another try.  After another less than fantastic experience, we can say that location and value were the only things we found appealing about our stay at Flamingo.  Neither of factors are appealing enough to get us to return to Flamingo.  

If traveling with a teen, the pool is basically non existent because of the fact that there is a 21+ pool and a pool for kids and those with kids.  The under 21 pool is small and overflowing with 5 to 8 year olds; definitely not a welcoming sight for adults or teens.  

The dining options at Flamingo are lacking in comparison with other resorts, however, its location makes it easy to access the better food options in the area.  

The AC unit in our room was not working upon arrival.  It took us a night to realize this because we spent most of the day after arriving on Fremont St.  When we notified guest services of the discomfort in our room, ""Thanks for letting us know,"" was the response we were first given.  After prodding them, they agreed to send someone to the room to try to fix it.  This didn't happen.  When checking out, we reiterated our displeasure with the conditions and their lack of attending to it, and we were told that we didn't bring it to their attention because it was not recorded in their computer.  In the end, we were comped the resort fee for one night out of four ($28).  Absolutely an unacceptable resolution to the situation.  After telling them that we were displeased with their attempt, or rather their lack of attempt, at resolving the issue, they told us that if we have problems in our next stay at the Flamingo, to let them know right away; again implying that we did not notify them of the problems to begin with.  We quickly informed them that we would not be staying with them again, and they seemed to have absolutely no problem with that.  

I highly recommend thinking twice before staying at Flamingo.",0,0,0

It has been her favorite place and is always her first choice. It has always been a decent experience due to the affordability and mainly due to the Go Pool and the Hotel location on the strip. 
Our last visit however was a disaster that has left a very bad taste in our mouths.
We check in at around 9pm on a Friday night and rushed to our rooms a We had bought tickets to go see Calvin Harris and had to be in line by a certain time.
We get to our room and come to find that the damn room is a mess. There are pillows, sheets, and covers were scattered across the room. To top it off, the exposed mattress had some sort of stain on it. We had no idea what it was but it is was a red disgusting splotch. We immediately called guest services.
We couldn't shower in the meantime since the bathroom wasn't ready either
20 minutes pass and service shows up. The lady was very sweet. She did apologize and said she had to go check with management on the issue. She at least gave us on hand towels while we waited.  
She comes back 15 minutes later to let us know that the room was not supposed to be in service and that ""the computer didn't update properly."" 
We were called by the manager on duty Juan a few minute later. He issued us a different room. We walked our asses downstairs to get the new room keys and off we went. 
Its about 10:15 as we enter in a rush to the new room on the 22nd floor. We turn the light switch on and the fucking lights don't work. Only the bathroom light was working and only one bedside lamp. I know they're just lights, but who the hell pays to have a room that is not in working order. You would expect everything to be clean and in working order when your paying for a room. 
After about 15 minutes waiting for the desk to answer the phone, we request to speak with Juan again to complain how the shitty service and poorly maintained rooms are a damn nightmare. He offers a food credit and a different room.
At this point my girlfriend and I are livid. 
Juan calls us back after about 20 minutes and says he has given us an upgrade and will provide the food credit. This time he tells us that a bell boy will be up to help us. As we wait for the help, the room across us had some stain on the wall. It might have been makeup, blood, or some spilled drink. Who knows. But there was a print of what seemed to look like a hand that was dragged on the wall. (see picture attached.) So that was a little concerning. I wonder what happened to that person.
We are advised at this point that the Omnia had reached capacity. So there go about an extra $200 we spent on the tickets. Another 20-25  minutes go by and our bell boy finally shows up. 
He helps us get to our room that is luckily on the same floor. He made sure that everything is working for us and that we are satisfied with the room. Which we were despite being pissed that my girlfriends birthday was ruined. 
We get to the new destination and turns out that during all this shit I had lost my ID. We rush back and retrace our steps. ID nowhere to be found. We had last seen it in the previous room when we were on the phone with management. Mind you it's about 1 or 2 am at this point. We call the desk after we scavenged our room just to make sure we didn't leave it on the floor or in the bathroom of our new room. We call the desk to see if we can gain access to the previous room. They had advised us that they could not check since security was not going to be in until morning. We were too upset so we call it a night.
We wake up and Turns out that our previous room was already booked, and due to privacy and what not they weren't going to be able to check for a lost item in the room. 
We decided to at least relax a bit in the tub and watch some TV on the television built into the wall that the manager had pinpointed as a highlight of the upgrade, and you guessed it, that didn't work either. At this point we said fuck it whatever shit couldn't get worse.
We couldn't get into the Go pool due to the ID issue but the bartenders at the family pool didn't ID me. So that was a plus.
The one star is pretty much due to the Bell Boy and the bartenders at the pool. The Manager never even bothered to provide us with the Food credit despite asking for it numerous times. 
Our stay here was a terrible. When I experienced similar issues elsewhere in the past, we were given an immediate resolution to satisfy our stay. There is a high likelihood of us not returning to this place because of this last experience. 
I hope this helps anyone that bothered reading this.",0,1,1

We chose this hotel because it is very affordable, I was not looking to spend much time in my room, the pool is decent and the location is great. We arrived at about 11am and check in wasn't until 1 although at booking it said 3. Well, we paid 30.00 to check in early. We also didn't experience the long lines, the lines come from everyone trying to check in at the same time. We got a room on the 27th floor at the very end if the hall. Our room was nothing spectacular, but it was huge and we had a decent view. The bathroom was extremely outdated but it had hot water and the toilet worked. The bed was comfy and so were the pillows. 
My only complaint is that our massive room had 3 lamps, but only one worked. I called the front desk and they out an order in but the problem was never fixed. Since the problem was not fixed we were able to check out late and not pay the fee, score! 
We had no real issues with our stay here. Expect older rooms unless you book the renovated ones. Expect long lines if you don't pay for early check in. Expect crowds because it's Vegas. Expect 32+ a night in resort fees which is outrageous but most resorts will charge that fee. Sucked because the weather was bad and we never set foot in the pool area.

We stayed in a deluxe room, NOT A GO ROOM.  So I imagine that the Go Rooms are how positive reviews are made for this hotel. The room was pretty average. The customer service was AWFUL. At 9am they began construction (  with no prior notice). It sounded and felt like an earth quake. I called the manager who was not willing to assist me. My companion called again and politely asked to be moved. We moved (without Bell Service assistance) to a room with no view beside a wall and pipes. The manger was unwilling to offer any type of compensation or any genuine concern for our troubles and pretty much wrote us off. We missed a day of house keeping after being asked what time we would like the room cleaned. Most days house keeping came late. Didn't love it

I recently stayed there for my friends bachlorette party. We got a suite on the remolded part of the hotel. at first glance I will say that it was a very modern looking place. I was very impressed with the decor. I think it was called the fabulous suite and it did, indeed, look fabulous... that is until I learned about one of the bathrooms. 

Right off the gate we were having problems. The toilet in the common are was not flushing. We were told someone was going to come fix it and indeed he did come. After he left, however, the toilet still did not flush. We figured we had two other bathrooms so it shouldn't be a big deal.... until one of the other toilets did not flush. We then called someone to fix that one and the other toilet which the man did.. well at least one of them. Needless to say that darn toilet never flushed the entire trip. The sink in the common are did not work well either. Over all the room was a hot stinking mess!

The hotel as a whole is very nice. They have some nice restaurants and and some nice shops. The staff was very helpful when lost or needing assistance with getting a taxi. The casino was very nice too. It was very clean and although it smelled like cigarette smoke (very common in any and all Las Vegas casinos) it was very well kempt! They also have actual live flamingos on the grounds too which kept the hotel true to its namesake.

Would I walk through this hotel, perhaps dine at the buffet and play a few table games again? Why yes I would! Will I be a guest in their hotel? most likely not! At least not until they get their plumbing game together",6,1,2

I tried the $20 trick and got a bigger room on the top floor but ended up with a Habitat\/Pool view.  The Fab room was good.  It had wood floor which was a plus in my mind.  It feels cleaner then carpet in my opinion.  I was hoping for a better upgrade to a Go Room but it didn't happen.  That is the gamble of the $20 trick.  We did get a Fridge and coffee maker which most Fab rooms don't have from what i understand.  The view was ok - part of the High Roller and the pool.  The bathroom was just so so.  The Hotel itself is one of the oldest still left on the strip and shows its age especially in the elevators.  I read some reviews that the elevators were slow.  We used the Habitat elevators and never found that to be the case.  We never waited very long for an elevator to go up or coming down and we were on the top floor (28th floor).

I think for the price and location on the strip it is hard to beat.  Is it as nice as some of the newer resorts - NO, but it is not bad.  Most of the time is not spent in the hotel room - just a place to sleep and shower.  Our room satisfied that - clean nice room, bathroom clean and simple- nothing fancy.

If you are wanting something not to expensive, middle of the strip, then i would recommend at least consider this place.
Pool - We went to the pool on Friday.  The pool is very nice - it does have a 21 and over pool which is the one we went to - avoids the kids.  You do need to get there fairly early if not when they open to get a chair.  We got lucky as someone was leaving and was able to get their chairs.  We got there right around 10 am - pool opens at 9 am and closes at 6pm  Keep that in mind.  Drinks at the pool is expensive bucket of 6 beers is 35 plus tax.  Specialty drinks will run 18 and up.  Also note:  No  outside drinks (bottled water, gatorade, etc) allowed.   Pool has a DJ and was nice - looks crowded but i didn't feel that way in the pool.  Pool is only 3.5 feet deep so mostly stand in cool water and drink and people watch but it is a good way to pass some time outside the casino.

Dining - we only ate at Carlos and Charlies - we ate on Wednesday night (arrival night) - right around 6:30pm  - no wait to get seated - waitress was quick to our table and took our drinks and then our order.  Food was delivered quickly and was good.  We had Carlos and Charlies Burrito - we split it and glad we did.  2 drinks each and the food - total was around 35.00 not bad...
We didn't get a chance to eat the buffet so i can't comment on it.

We used the self check out kiosk and was easy and simple to use.

One thing i didn't care for was the Wyndam Resort people that always tried to get you to listen   to some spill and you would get free show tickets.  I am in Vegas for my time.  I don't want to spend my precious time listening to some sales pitch for free show tickets.  So just be aware of them.  One way i found to avoid them - walk bythem with you on your phone pretending to be talking to someone and they will leave you alone.  Just a tip from me to you.

Resort Fee - supposed to include WiFi but we couldn't get it in our room.  Otherwise I would give this a 4 instead of 3.  

This resort is doable in my opinion but your are not going to be wowed.

Hope this helps.",0,0,0

The room:
We stayed in a standard room, it was on the 20th floor. We had a great view of the pool and loved the HUGE open windows looking out into the pool area. There was a flat screen TV, a large king sized bed with this awesome fur throw on the bottom of the bed, and hardwood floors! I was VERY Impressed. Last time I had stayed at the Stratosphere & this was such an upgrade.

The location:
Perfect location right in the middle of the strip. Right by the Venetian (also saw blue man group while we were there, I would def recommend that show) and across the street from Serendipity.

The pool:
Got to visit the 21+ pool on both friday & saturday.Friday after the sun had gone down the pool was a little messyw ith beer bottles but nonetheless was fun! it's a great PARTY environment. Not a good place if you just want to relax, but if you want to have fun you will enjoy it. There is this amazing cave with a water fall you can swim under. Saturday it was very crowded but everyone was very nice and it was a fun environment. The drinks are expensive (but it's vegas- what do you expect?) and you cannot bring outside drinks into the hotel

Checkin:
Checkin was easy , but that could be because of the time we got there.  Checkout was easier we just left our keys in the room & left to the airport.

The food in the hotel was alright. We had johnnyrockets & the pizza place downstairs by the elevators. Nothing to complain about.

Great location.  Right in the middle of the Strip with easy access to I-15 and LAS airport.  You can walk all the way down to Mandalay Bay or up to the Encore without getting too winded.  Bill's, Bally's, Paris, Caesars, O'Shea's, Imperial Palace, and Bellagio are less than a 5-minute walk.

Great pool.  A nice layout with a tropical feel.  Excellent service and a good mix of sun and shady spots in which to relax.  The GO pool gets a little ""MTV Spring Break""-y, but the Beach Club Pool is family-friendly and quieter.

Good casino.  It has a funky layout, but has most of the slots and table games people like.  The cocktail service is good and the staff is friendly.  

Substandard rooms.  OK, this is where the Flamingo misses the mark.  We stayed in one of the standard rooms, not the GO rooms or a suite.  The room was older and in need of some TLC.  In the bathroom, the toilet didn't flush well and the vanity was in a moderate state of disrepair.  The shower was decent, though.  In the bedroom, there was no alarm clock and a scarcity of power outlets.  The carpet could use a good scrubbing as well.  I was not impressed at all with the housekeeping service.  Our housekeeper simply made our bed and replaced the towels.  He\/she never vacuumed or removed empty glasses.  On the plus side, the bed was comfortable and we had a great view.

   I had my eye on the Flamingo for a long time because of the pools. I was very disappointed. Many of the pictures of the pool show an oasis of room to swim. When I got there, I noticed that there were all these palm trees on islands around the pool. That made it most challenging to swim in big areas. Every time you think you have a little room to swim, another island with a palm tree, obstructing.
    Checking in, I never saw something like I did. There had to be 2-300 people checking in. The line extended way back into the hallway of the hotel from the reservation desk, twisting around. I had already paid for my trip, so I went to the Kiosk to check in, automatically. When I was finishing up with the Kiosk, I wanted to change Credit card that I paid with and put a new card on file for charges. The Kiosk did not have the technology to do that.

    I went up to the reservation desk and saw a guy named Benjamin. Short, cru-cut style hair. He told me that my only option was to go to the end of the 2-300 person line. To change a credit card? When my vacation is paid for, you want me to wait 2-3 hours in the blazing heat to 30 second change my credit card? How is that good customer service? Benjamin seemed as if he could care less.  He also did not tell me that there was another line called Key and Mail. Although we waited 75 minutes on that line, it was much shorter than the regular check-in line. Over an hour to change a credit card on check-in. Every person on the Key and Mail line was dumbfounded as to why nobody seemed to care that people were waiting hours to check in.

     Also, at the Total Rewards desk, I went to get a copy of my card. I saw Anthony, who was working with the line for the high rollers. He said that he was in able to help me because I wasn't a high roller member. He said I had to go to the other side for the lower-tier members, which had three people on line and he had nobody on his line; and he couldn't be bothered helping me. I can't be a high roller if I can't get a card.

     The Wifi in the room was a disaster-never synced up. I was at Disney a week prior, and it was free. It was not at the Flamingo. 
    We were charged $300 for resort fee and room fee combined-I just don't know what services I got out of those charges. The buffet cost money every day.",0,0,0

The Flamingo in Las Vegas is in a convenient location on the strip a stone's throw from some of the major casinos and resorts. The staff is extremely professional and amicable. We dealt with Brian at the front desk and Jeanette in guest services both of whom were friendly.

Cons

Despite it's nice location, the room itself was rather gross. To start, the rates online were different than those that we paid. We wanted to pay in cash so we figured we would be better off making the reservation in person. After watching 3 desk agents get up and never come back there was a crowd full of people with only 2 staff members present. After finally making it to the front after 35 or 40 minutes the rates that we ended up paying were not those online but we were both so tired it wasn't even worth bringing up. Five minutes after putting our bags down we realized we made a mistake booking the hotel and wish we had only paid for one night upfront instead of two. There were black stains on the white shower curtain, hairs on the ceiling, mildew in the shower, no fan in the bathroom, no towel hooks in the wall and nicks on the wall. I was looking forward to taking a bath upon arrival but as soon as I saw the tub I knew I would wait until I went back home. Some of the appliances in the room were unplugged forcing us to move the furniture to plug it in ourselves. The sheets were coming off the bed and continued to do so for the rest of our stay. In terms of the WiFi, it was decent but on the slow end and only allowed for 2 devices to be connected at once. The room did not come with a refrigerator or microwave and if we wanted a fridge it was an additional $15 per night not including taxes. There was a constant and unpleasant odor that permeated throughout our room for the 2 nights we stayed. The walls are rather thin so when the people staying to the left of us were in their room we could actually hear the conversation clearly...from our bed...across the room. To top it off the air conditioner was extremely loud and rather irritating. The pools were alright. The pool for those over 21 looked fun but busy while the beach club pool was extremely overcrowded. We left before we even sat down after considering paying the $200 for a cabana just so we would not have to sit an inch away from strangers on either side of us. In addition you weren't allowed to bring water and bags are searched. If water is found they will make you throw it away or the security will not allow you in. Despite the friendliness of the staff and it's location I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. Overall it was a rather gross experience. Honestly if I could have I would have gone back downstairs and immediately after check in and asked for a refund but we couldn't do so without a cancellation fee so we decided to stick it out. I wish we had though. 

The two nights before, we stayed in Tuscany Casino just off the strip and both of us wish we hadn't left. Even though it was 10 mins farther by walking we were better off with a more low key pool, and a room 3 times the size for a better price. Don't make the same mistake we did. Either pay more for a better hotel or stay at Tuscany if you don't mind walking farther.",1,0,1

For the money, on the location, the petite Go Room is all you need as a home base in Vegas.  Mine was immaculately clean upon arrival, with crisp sheets and a comfortable coverlet on the king-sized bed.  

The Go Rooms aren't for everyone, though.  I was puzzled at first about the frosted glass surrounding the bathroom, and the ambient pink glow that diffused through the glass.  I ended up using the bathroom as a tacky Flamingo-pink nightlight.  (Since I usually end up leaving a light on in a strange place to keep from having a 3AM ""Where the hell am I?"" moment, this worked for me.)  The bathroom door was on a slider, which kept the room from feeling cramped.  

A lot of the room's space is taken up by the bath, and there's a lot of little touches to make this space feel upgraded.  The shower has some additional jets, but, they can't be angled, so at my short height, they were more awkward than luxurious.  I would have liked a tub, but, my room didn't include one.  There was tons of hot water and great water pressure, so no real complaint about the shower other than the lost opportunity to have it be just a little more fabulous.  The hidden television in the mirror was an amusement, and kind of neat when getting ready in the morning.  Toiletries supplied were a touch better than average, but I'd recommend hitting the Walgreens up the street for an upgrade.  

The luxury room faced the strip.  The 17th floor had a spectacular view of Caesar's palace and the Bellagio fountains.  But, a strange screen material made the view hazy -- it took me a while to realize that the screen was the building-sized advertisement for the Donnie and Marie show.  One of the best parts of staying at the Flamingo is that unlike Caesar's, you don't have to stare at that eyesore of an advertisement!  

Soundproofing was reasonably good, though I could occasionally hear a loudmouth next door.   The bed was comfortable.  And despite my repeated attempts to tip my maid, money was never, ever removed from the room. I felt that my belongings were secure, though, if you've got really valuable items, there's an in-room safe for them.  

Deeply disappointing, though is the $13.99 wired internet charge despite a premium price for the room.  Wireless is also available for a similar charge. Internet access is charged per device, so, choose wisely.  Phone service, like most phone service in Vegas, is insanely overpriced - bring your cell phone.

The Flamingo has a small garden with its namesake birds and a few other unusual specimens, a relaxing refuge from all the casino action.  The Vegas ghost tour stops through there at night to tell some spooky tales.  But, late at night, I was approached in the garden by far spookier panhandlers looking for a cigarette handout.  I doubt that'd happen at Caesar's, and it make me question the overall security of the property.  Each night, fliers were slipped under the door - timeshare promos, pizza parlors.  Nothing terrible, but, it appears that the Flamingo doesn't necessarily monitor things quite as vigorously as some of its sister properties.  

I spoke with a few other guests when relaxing in the garden, watching the wedding parties take their photos.  From what I heard, some other guests encountered uneven service - a diabetic unable to obtain a refrigerator for a regular (non-Go) room, others complaining of sub-par linens on the beds.  So, not all rooms at the Flamingo are created equal, and special requests might go ignored.

But, I'd stay in a Go room again in a heartbeat.  The close proximity to the Strip and the relatively petite size of the property compared to a lot of the other megacasinos nearby makes this a great launching pad for your Vegas adventures.  Stock up the minifridge as your own personal minibar with a trip to the Alberson's up the street, and you've got your own personal haven from the noise and the bustle below when you need an escape.",5,1,1

Plus the elevators to the Go rooms are few feet away from the pool. Flamingo opened a separate pool for hotel guests but with a fee of $10. Paying for the additional fee is very worth the price because you literally have the privacy of your own pool and its not crowded at all.

Thank you Flamingo staff and my personal VIP total experiences group host, Sheri Schreiber -Total Experiences\/VIP Manager 3570 Las Vegas Blvd. South; Las Vegas, NV 89109 - Direct 702.731.7451 | Office 702.731.7238

Now to details. Over arguably the busiest weekend of the year, nothing was missed. I had more than 10 rooms assigned to my birthday party. Every request and detail was fulfilled. I needed some people to be in adjoining rooms and others I just wanted on my floor. It worked well. 

I am so pleased with how well everything worked out. Seriously, if I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't change a thing.  Sheri was really comforting, understanding and resourceful.  She was challenged by the fact that I knew the landscape of Vegas more than most tourists - but she still was willing to go the extra mile in any and every circumstance. 

Hotel Room:  All of the resort rooms have now been updated to Fab rooms. They have hardwood floors and I believe the bathrooms have not been updated, but seriously it's a bathroom - if you spend too much time in here - you are doing the wrong things in Vegas. The bed was comfy and the AC worked well. I was very pleased given that I stayed here like 5 years ago for a wedding and I wasn't happy. This time I am so happy to see the improvements they've made. 

Pool: What can I say about the pool which hasn't already been said?  It is just fun and you will have a great time.  I like the fact that you can have a spot to party your a$$ off and you can also find a place to lay low and relax. 

Food:  We didn't eat inside Flamingo so we can't comment on this. In the past, we have enjoyed food at Margaritaville. You won't go wrong there for food or a party environment or both. 

Gambling: The tables are the standard going rates for middle of the strip.

Valet\/self-parking:  This is a super busy weekend, but I was very disappointed how many times the valet was full unless you are a seven-star member (gambling\/entertainment card through Harrah's) 

I will do this again in a heartbeat.  Don't read the older reviews - read this one and know it is completely accurate. This hotel has learned from the past and they have invested a good amount of money to make it better. 

Lastly, they were smart to use self-checking kiosks because the lines at times were extremely long - just a tip if you want to bypass the regular check in line. 

Have a great time and be sure if you have a group event - reach out to Sheri - thanks again!",0,0,1

Being that it's one of the oldest hotel in Las Vegas, it's a nice place to be at. My room wasn't too bad either. It had a bit of a feminine vibe to it. Polka dot couch in the corner, pink shaggy throws on the bed, and some other pink decorations in the room. The rooms gave off a nice, clean, smoke-free environment. 

This hotel is better than most of the other hotels I've stayed at. They offer more places to eat at. There's a food court as well as other small coffee joints inside the hotel. There were cafes as well as pizza parlors. 

Overall, I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. Couldn't really ask for anything better for the price I had paid for. The only thing that had scared me a little were the elevators. I find it odd that there's no 13th floor on my building!",0,0,0

I paid $300 for three nights in a suite last weekend, seriously can't beat that price. But, it's true - the amenities are lacking. While there was lots of space in the room, the beds are meh (although very clean), the carpets are pretty dirty, the bathtub is straight outta 1981, and there's no minibar in the room.

I've stayed in the go-rooms before, and while they are much smaller than this suite, there are definitely a nicer experience. 

The service was nice throughout though and I really really enjoy the Flamingo pool. It's adults only (except for a small, very separate pool elsewhere for kids), it's pretty huge, they play good music, and they have cheap craps tables poolside. 

Would I stay there again? ...meh, I'd probably suck it up and upgrade to a Go-Room if I did. While I don't spend a ton of time in the hotel room when I'm in Vegas, it is much nicer to have a big plush bed and a schmancy shower waiting for you when you do get back to the room.",25,13,15

 We spent 3 nights at this hotel during our stay for a conference in Las Vegas in September 2005.
The room was adequate...but we expected much more for the amount of money we paid.
The pool is always crowded - to a point where it's unpleasant. It's a beautiful pool, however, they close it frequently to cater to private parties - as early as 5PM.
During our last night, the hotel decided to have a party for, what the security department said was 10,000 people in the courtyard, which about 50% of the rooms face. It started at 8PM and continued until at least 1PM. They had the sound system blaring and it was unbearable. They are more interested in making money off of private parties than keeping their customers happy. In order to have 10,000 people - you need a VENUE - not a POOL outside of everyone's windows.
However, upon our complaint (since we had an early flight to catch we had to sleep!) they did find us a new room quickly. They didn't offer to move all of our stuff for us, but they did bring up the key. The room we were moved to was almost worth the $230 a night they charged. Almost.
So, if you're planning a stay on the strip, I have two pieces of advice:
1. Book EARLY so you're not stuck, and
2. Do NOT stay at the Flamingo.
The Hilton Company should be ashamed!

At this point 5 employees before her had the opportunity to tell me about the ""fine print"" including the person who booked our room. No one had uttered a word about increased package fees until that moment. Really Flamingo? You are so desperate that you have to rip off your customers?

We got in around 11pm and parked in the parking garage $10 a day. We walked into the main lobby (extremely far from the garage) and waited in line. It was a line of maybe 10 people and it took us one hour to get to the front of the line. We booked on Travelocity for the upgraded room and the told us they didn't have one and they couldn't make sure we had  that room since we didn't book directly through them. So they gave us a $30 resort credit. The next day we had to wait till 12 to change rooms. I highly recommend to pay the extra $25 for the better room. So much nicer than the basic room we stayed in the first night. Overall we had a good time once we switched rooms. We wee told our room key would pay for parking and when we tried to use the room key it didn't work. You have to be an upgraded customer to get free parking.

cons:
-arrived 1130pm to check in.  while waiting for an hour in a long line, my buddy had enough time to buy us two slices of pizza.  We finished it and we weren't anywhere closer to the the front of the line.  There were 3 employees at the front desk checking in a line that was more than 25 people long. -- take advantage of online check-in if you can

-elevators go to every floor.  What does that mean for someone on the 27th floor?  Stops at every floor imaginable going up and down.  Watching people hop on and off while I wait to reach for the skiies.  It's worse going down because it stops at every floor for everyone trying to get the heck out of their floors.

-Advised to keep keycard away from phone.  Um. . .it's 2015 and everyone has a phone.  I'll need my keycard and phone while I wander the strip and need to return to my temporary abode.  My consequence? Keycard denies my entry to my room and I stand in front of my room like a reject.  Then I proceed back down the elevator to get my card fixed and go back up.  Precious time wasted.

I have a bathtub and high floor as part of my standing requests wit Caesars' hotels.  I was given a room with the shower only, but the view was good. It was given to me ""for my birthday"",not because I am Platinum and my boyfriend is Diamond in rewards status.  As this trip was to celebrate my birthday with my son, I chose this hotel over other hotels due to the pools.

I let the front desk know that I wanted a bathtub. Unfortunately they did not have anything with a decent view and the bathtub. This highly unfortunate for those of us raised in Europe and others who prefer baths over showers.  The front desk associate said that she would see what could be done.  I am over 2\/3 of the way to Diamond status myself, and they could not give us a room upgrade for our patronage or my birthday.  Boyfriend was already pushing to drop Caesars and go to the M-life casinos more often.  This made us both angry, as our privileges have been cut drastically.

Our room had a great view, and very persistent housekeeping.  However the wallpaper is peeling from the entrance of the bathroom, and the bathroom door does not slide closed completely. The handle was also falling off the door.  Beware if you flush the toilet it will not flush again for another 2 to 3 minutes.

In a city where nothing closes, the pool at this hotel closes at 6 PM and the water slides close at 5:30 PM, and are open only seasonally and on weekends.  Apparently 110 degrees on a Wednesday does not warrant the slides to be open.  Part of the water slide area has been given to the adult area.  Uncool.  No one can use the slide as there is no access to it.  To make matters worse, there is a temporary iron barrier that is not bolted down.  First day I saw this fall on someone as they snuck under. The lifeguard at the end, in the adult area sent the teen girl back.  It actually fell on her as she was going under it.  The second time I went to the pool it did not go as smoothly.  A teenage boy went under the barrier and pulled it down on the foot on one of the mothers in the area.  We requested her ice.  They should have offered it before being asked.  They did not offer her a chair. Apparently chairs and small containers of eye drops are dangerous but slippery steps and walkways and falling barriers are safe.

Another major issue for the any age pool is the stairs to the slide and down to the pools have no nonslip surface. They are extremely slippery when wet.  I slid and dropped my cell phone. Fortunately they cover protected and it popped off only leaving myself and my phone wet.

On the first trip down to the pool my eyes watered and burned from the chlorine.  The second time I went to the pool a security guard would not let me in the pool with my 1\/2 oz. bottle of dry eye tears.  I have dry sensitive eyes.

I have not stayed at the hotel in a couple years, but we use the Margaritaville craps table the most. I don't think I will be coming back to this hotel anytime soon, as there are other Caesars hotels that are much better in regard to quality of rooms, management, pools and customer service.",4,3,1

Also housekeepers don't knock before entering your room which was very awkward and uncomfortable. We were fortunately clothed and decent but it would have been weird if we weren't.

Strike one: the hot tubs and adult areas are segregated from the family friendly areas.  Which means that if you are a family or a group with families and childless couples, you may have to choose between being able to let the kids have fun or let the adults have fun.

Strike two:  Closed for ""wind"".  Sure it was a bit windy and cool, but when better to enjoy a cocktail in a hottub.

Strike three: some kid threw up in the water slide area so they CLOSED THE ENTIRE pool complex for the rest of the day!

On the last night we stayed, our room was broken into while we sleeping in it and our phones, cash, and my engagement ring were stolen.  When we woke up we realized that someone broke into our room because the door would not properly shut all the way and the night latch was also broken.  We called security and he did his ""inspection"" by looking at the door and taking photos of the broken latch with his CELL PHONE (not an actual camera for incidents).  He also only had us fill out two incident report forms even though there were four of us whose property had been stolen.  When we went to speak with the manager about the faulty lock and that someone had been in our room while we were sleeping which was a threat to our safety; the manager would not do anything but say she was sorry and only the risk management and security would be able to further help us.  I was outraged to see that as a customer who had just been through an inconceivable event that I was so quickly tossed to the side.  I also believe that because it happened on our last night and everything had been paid for, they did not care one bit about helping us; only to move us along so they could help the next customer checking in.  I told her that I did not want to pay for room that was damaged and obviously put our safety at risk.  I asked several times if she or another manager would come to the room to see the damaged lock and she refused and continued to say that only risk management and security take care of these issues.  In the following days, I contacted the risk management.  Once I finally got a hold of him (being that my phone call was never returned and), he informed me that because there was not any other key used to enter the room (a maids key for example) he sides with the hotel and sent the incident to a third party.  When I asked him if he ever saw the photos that the security guard took with his cell phone of the broken night latch, he said he had not received them but the report said that there were photos taken.  I asked him to send those photos to the third party as soon as he received them and he said he would.  However, once I was in contact with the third party, she said she had not received them.  I realized after getting off the phone with him that was not right for him to have made a decision about our incident when he had not even seen the photos.  In fact I am currently trying to get a hold of him to find out if he obtained the photos yet or if I may send the ones I took to him.  However, whenever I call I only reach an answering machine and am never called back.  I could never have imagined having such a horrendous experience at the Flamingo Las Vegas.  I also never thought I would be treated to badly and unprofessional by people that are in in upper management or are in charge of handling important issues and customer service.  It shocks me that these are people who should be representing the Flamingo and all of Caesar's the most.  They should have been helping me, the customer who had just been offended in their hotel while sleeping; instead of giving a continuous customer service reply of ""We are sorry that happened but...""  It truly demonstrated that this company does not care about their customers or what happens on their facilities.  

Not only did the hotel refuse to reimburse us for the hotel room that was damaged, after arguing with the third party about what was lost, we found out that due to ""Inn Keepers Laws"" in Nevada, only 750.00$ could be given for any lost or damaged items. Which is no where close to replacing cell phones and and engagement ring.

Gorgeous views of the bellagio fountains and Ceaser palace fountains. Conveniently located mid strip. Amenities galore. Best than most hotels on the strip. Coffeemaker. Fridge. Iron. Hairdryer. 

I was pleasantly surprised with my stay at the flamingo hotel. My room was fabulous and more superior than my rooms at the linq, Paris, palazzo, venetian, Tropicana and even comparable to the Wynn.  Yes you heard me. The flamingo go rooms are in that league. 

Newly renovated with posh white pleather and pink walls. The chic rooms were clean and well taken care of. I was surprised that there were the most amenities available than any of the above mentioned hotels. A fridge, and coffeemaker were the best to have in my room. And made my stay more enjoyable. With cold water and hot coffee available anytime it really saved me money every single day. I loved the double shower head with one specifically for your back. And the iron and hairdryer were great additions for my nights out on the strip. WiFi was fast and I never had any problems being kicked off or with lagging Internet. Remote controlled curtains were a nice touch if you wanted to block out the fabulous view of the bellagio fountains.

The location can't be beat unless you are staying at Ceaser palace. Which I believe has the best location on the strip.  But it is easily accessible and walkable to all parts of the strip. Being mid strip meant less walking and no real need for a car during my stay here. Like I said...staying here saves you money.

The bed was comfortable and comparable to the lovely mattresses at the Wynn or palazzo. The room was new and cleaner than most hotels I have stayed at. There was plenty of space. I found the hotel to be quiet and I had no problems with noise during my stay. (See my horrible experience at the linq). I had no issues with the elevators. It was fast especially going down from your room on the higher floors (I was on floor 26)

The pleather and pink walls made me feel like a princess and the entire room was beautifully decorated. There was a TV in my room and my bathroom. Which my son appreciated. 

There's flamingos on the main floor. Very cool and relaxing vibe in hectic Las Vegas.  The go pool is a large 18+ pool with plenty of booty shaking madness. There's also a large slide too. Room guests get in on free despite a charge on Saturdays. 

Tips: 1. Ask for a room in the lobby towers facing the fountains at bellagio. 2. The go rooms are worth every penny. Despite being comped during my stay. The resort fee of $29 a day is worth the fabulous WiFi you receive. (Hey you pay $30 a day at encore or have to put up with lagging Internet everywhere else). 3. Tip $20 on check in. I'm pretty sure that's why I was upgraded with my comped offer.

Fabulous stay. I think I'll have to come back because my room was that fabulous. Don't believe all the bad reviews. Because I can't rave about this hotel any more. It's sooooo much better than Paris,  linq and palazzo combined!",35,17,31

What you should expect is a decent, well-priced mediocre hotel, with a perfect location on the strip.  Any higher expectations than that and you might as well stay at the Wynn for 4 times the price.

As I'm writing this review, they have a special starting from $35\/night I found at http:\/\/www.mycheapvegas.com\/.  Also, there's a coupon for free buffet with a Nathan Burton show ticket, which is a pretty decent magic show.

All this with a poker room that has a great atmosphere and a decent cocktail service and what you get is a pretty good vacation.

First problem that there was no parking in the garage. All the spots were for valet, car rentals and hilton grand vacations. Finally found a spot on the roof and took the ghetto elevator to the lobby. Checked in and had to drag all our luggage through the casino with a bunch of steps to get to the elevators. When we finally get to our floor we have to walk forever to get to our room. I've heard the rooms were renovated but they're not that great. It's like when a house is flipped and they're trying to do the least amount possible to make it look better. The floors in the room and the countertop in the bathroom are new, and the rest is crap.

Las Vegas hoteliers have not learned how to run a registration desk. The Flamingo was no different from my experienced at the Bellagio, Wynn, Monte Carlo, etc. Under staffed, lengthy lines, inordinate delays on check-in. Note to management: Nevada has one of the highest unemployment rates in the U.S. Place a classified ad!

I was, however, offered an upgrade to a remodeled room for only $10.00 additional per night. I took a room on the eighth floor overlooking the casino roof and, more importantly, the flamingo nature preserve. Comfortable beds, clean, good air conditioning. Negatives included no shampoo initially, faulty sink drain, unusable safe, and exceptionally poor 4g wireless connection. Phone service was essentially 2g including Android service. Unless you pay extra for house broadband.

Hallways smell of cigarettes, carpet seems left behind by Bugsy himself. Ancient, not in a collectible way.

In the lobby, hawkers of show tickets block entry on occasion to the elevator banks. Bring aspirin for headaches from smoke and noise in the casino.",1,1,0

I'm usually in Vegas for trade shows and don't spend much time in my room anyway. So, provided my hotel has easy access to whatever convention center, hot water and a comfortable bed, my complaints are typically minimal.

I stayed at the Flamingo for 2014 CES and don't really have anything bad to say. It's on the monorail loop (two stops to the LV convention center), there's some pretty decent, if not easy and convenient dining options, lots of bars and shops, and friendly staff. 

The Total Rewards program is worth it - my rate for 4 days at the Flamingo was less than one night a hotels that were a bit closer to the CES venue, but with a huge show like that you've got to expect jacked up prices.

The only really negative thing I'd say about this place is the hallway carpets have seen much better days - they need a steam clean, stat. Also, it didn't seem like the staff was too quick to grab room service trays and empty glasses out of the hallways. Not a deal breaker, but kind of off-putting.

I'd definitely stay at the Flamingo again - it's reasonably priced and pretty comfortable - and that typically fits my needs in sin city. If you're looking for value, it's a great spot. If you're looking for luxury, this probably isn't the place for you.",10,0,3

DISGUSTING.  Unfortunately, my bf and I didn't discover the used condom on the floor behind the door until the 2nd day.  When I first walked in after checking in, I looked around and saw a bobby pin on the bathroom sink, makeup streaks on the mirror, and white stains on their chair\/lounger thing.  I decided to ignore them since the hotel was cheap and we only wanted it for a home base.  But after seeing the used condom, we freaked out and immediately went to the concierge to let them know.

Concierge: We let them know, they apologized and said they'd take care of it.  We asked if we could change rooms, they said to talk to front desk.  

There are a bajillion people standing in line waiting to check in so we waited in the keys\/mail line for 30+ minutes as the next in line.

Front Desk: apologized, changed rooms, and offered us a $50 food\/drink credit at their approved locations.  Really? Not to be greedy or anything but that's it? You were negligent enough to let me sleep a night in the presence of someone else's bodily fluids and that's it?? By booking on Yelp, I get $20 in food and drinks!

Back to old room to get our stuff: condom still there, by now it's been 45 min since we've told someone. Don't you think that this is something you send someone up to take care of IMMEDIATELY?  What if we couldn't get our room switched, we would have to put up w\/ this disgusting thing for longer? I sure as **** won't touch it.

Other things wrong with this place:  

Hair drier didn't work, half the outlets didn't work, phone couldn't call front desk, elevators didn't work half the time, hotel hallways had empty bottles of gatorade, trash.

Construction on the floor blocking off our route to our room, we had to take the elevator to the 7th floor w\/ our luggage, walk all the way to another elevator, come down the stairs with luggage to get to our room...  

Our new room had a wonderful view of a roof. Whatever, don't care... until I woke up one morning, opened the blinds and find a bunch of dudes staring back at me because they're working on the roof.  I wasn't dressed for the day yet. Ugh.

Food: we used our credit on their buffet, so not worth it and they almost weren't going to honor it because we had checked out literally 10 min ago until my bf was so pissed he just yelled BULLSH*T.  ""How are we going to charge you if you checked out already?"" Um you don't, $50 is more than enough to cover your crappy brunch buffet.

TLDR: Sure, 2nd room was cleaner, and location of the Flamingo is convenient

For the price, is reasonable and fit to our budget. Location is very nice and convenient right in the middle of the vegas strip. 

The guest service agent was helpful when I called and asking about ice machine on the floor.

Check in process was a little disappointed since they said that our high floor with high roller view (as requested & booked) was not available at first. On the other hand they offered the vegas strip view instead. Eventually, my wife got the room that she wanted after few chats.

The only thing flamingo needs to improve from our prospective:

- Turn down service every day
- Refilling up the toiletries
- HVAC that contaminated with cigarettes smells (everytime We turn the AC at around 11-3am, it smells cigarette in the room and smells is gone by 7am in the morning)

It's not Bellagio, Wynn or any of those...but it doesn't pretend to be.  For what you get, you can't beat the Flamingo.  First, convenience.  The location - right in the middle of the Strip, with easy access to cross the street to Bellagio or Caesar's Palace.  To make things even better, there is a Monorail station located in the back of the hotel, which saved us alot of walking time.  They've definitely been working on upgrading the place too , as the elevators, hallways and our room were all modern and quite nice.  We stayed in the GO Room with a view of the Bellagio fountains.  This room was more affordable than many hotels right here in my small town in upstate New York!  And you really can't beat a bathroom with a TV built into the mirror.  All employees we encountered were very friendly.  My only complaint about this place would be the long wait to check in - the other reviewers are right on about that.  We waited for a good half hour in line when we arrived.  Checking out was a breeze at least.  Based on convenience and affordability, this hotel is a great choice - I will absolutely return.",0,0,0

The beds and the view were nice, but our bathroom was in need of a re-do; it was tiny and cheap-looking and the shower curtain was obviously stained with something. The carpet in the hallways was dingy, dirty and wrinkled and ripped in some places. The elevators were really sketchy and dirty and we were concerned more than a few times that we'd get stuck in one. Some of them would even slam shut before anyone could get into them after letting people off. 


The most disturbing thing was that on one night, other guests were involved in some kind of loud fight outside our room. Disruptive, but everyone's drunk here so its not surprising. The surprising thing was that we looked outside our room the next morning to find blood on the carpet and dripped all over the walls. Gross. Even more gross was that we left for the day and came back late that night to find that none of the blood had been cleaned up. I don't see any excuse for that one.

I'm glad that we made that rash decision because these Go Rooms are nice!

I kinda felt like Austin Powers staying in one of them, striped pink walls, hot pink lights in the bath its psychedelic!

Cons - the parking garage is absolutely trashed. The elevators never worked during our stay which means you had to walk up and down three flights of stairs if you parked on the 6th floor (lots of parking on the 6th and 7th floor and the hotel is on the 3rd floor). I reserved and put a deposit down for a king go room with strip view. There are were no king rooms available at check in so I received a queen go room with strip view - it was not discounted nor was anything offered. I think if I place a deposit down on a king room - I should get a king room. There was no tub in the bathroom, just a shower. Probably okay for most people but I wanted to soak after a long day on the strip. DVD\/stereo system didn't work. Bathroom sink was slow draining.

This was my first stay at the Flamingo. I randomly always end up staying at the Excalibur, so this trip I worked real hard to convince the gals to stay anywhere but there. I need a change! Oh and what a welcome change the Flamingo was! 
I was so happy that it was centrally located to everything we wanted on the Strip and even a walk to NY NY seemed quick. It could also have been the giant Eiffel Tower shaped pina colada I was chugging, but I can't confirm. :) 
Our room had a Strip view, which was really cool. 5 of us stayed in one room w\/ a rollaway cot and had no issues with space. The room was nothing fancy like their Go rooms, but it was clean and well appointed.

The Go pool, their 21+ ""European-style"" pool was a tad bit of a letdown. I was really hoping for some topless sunbathing, but when we went, the place was packed. And it was a meat market. AND no one was topless. What's the point?! We headed back to the family pool and were thoroughly satisfied.

I really wanted to like the Flamingo this time.  We've stayed twice before.  First time was great, second meh, but I thought perhaps I'd judged them too harshly.  Nope, they've gone even further downhill.

The Flamingo is where there is always a hidden joke - and the joke is on you!

First joke is the check-in.  Who started this racket with the 4PM check-in?  Our previous stays it has been much earlier.  After an hour and fifteen minute wait to check in ""early"" (at 2PM) we find that they want $28 to check in ""early"" or, for $30, we can have a room upgrade!  So basically it's a forced room upgrade if you want a decent check-in time.  There were only two people staffing check-in, a decision made by management to short staff the area to save money.

Next, valet parking.  We stayed two nights and were told, on a MONDAY NIGHT, that the Valet parking was full.  How exactly can valet parking be full on an off night?  Again, I feel this is management's decision, not staff - I am sure they'd much rather be parking people and earning tips.

Finally, the pool.  The worst joke of all.  We wound up at the Flamingo the first time on a whim seven years ago and loved the pool.  So did my kid, three at the time.  The water slide, in three parts, goes from a big slide up top to two smaller ones below, finally into the big pool which has a waterfall.  Great fun.  We had to show security at the door both previous trips because the pool was correctly deemed to be a big draw.  This time?  The water slide is cut off at the start of the third slide, making a ""kiddie"" pool above and and ""adult"" pool below.  The ""kiddie"" section was lame, lame, lame, and a big disappointment to my child.  No one bothered to ask for our room key because, well, who would want to bother crashing it?  We have a better setup in our small City pool at home.

My wife went over to the ""adult"" pool and noticed two spots where people had vomited.  During her short stay there, another person hurled right onto the concrete.  Is this Bugsy Siegel's vision?  Is this the vision of elegance the Flamingo once represented?

I get that there can be parties or events, but kids not allowed in the main pool at all?  Not even on weekdays?  Instead it has to be reserved for a drunkatorium where people regularly retch?  If the financial geniuses making these decisions are trying to turn a short-term profit, they are surely damaging the long-term brand name of the Flamingo.  That is no way to increase shareholder value, the requirement of every public company.

And then there was the air conditioning.  It was hot and humid during our stay and the air conditioning was clearly overloaded.  It took hours to cool our room, and in the elevator hallway, a steady drip of water came from the ceiling, at my guess due to overloaded condensers.  

In our room, the internet was not on.  And we couldn't complain, because the phone wasn't on either!  My wife went down and complained, and after another few minutes we got internet but not phone.  After another trip they sent someone to check the phone - but it wasn't the phone, it was just that the front desk people didn't know how to work the system.  Is that their fault?  I say no, it is management making the decision to short staff the front desk and short train the workers, all in the name of saving a buck.

It wasn't all bad.  The view of the strip we got was nice.   The buffet, decent value for the fairly high price.   But all in all the management of this hotel sends the message that they don't need your business.  Take them at their word and stay somewhere else.",6,0,0

Pros-
-Above all, AMAZING pool area! Our time by their pool was the best time we spent in Vegas. We were able to have the party atmosphere without going to a day club that has nowhere to sit\/lay.
-Affordable
-Unbeatable location on the strip with lots to do very close by.
-Some reasonable restaurants are right next door which made dining affordable and easy for some of the lunches\/dinners.
-While I'm not an avid gambler, I've always had fun at their casino.
- And did I mention the pool?!?

Cons-
-We stayed in one of the suites and the decor felt a little tacky. It feels like they were going for modern, chic, fun and a little sexy but on a limited budget. We even had to request another lamp because the lighting was so awkward. It may just be that they are getting to the point where things are not as shiny and polished as they once were. As the saying goes, you get what you pay for.
-Long wait times for check-in (although, is this abnormal?)
-The nightlife was non-existent and if you are looking for a good bar or club you will be going elsewhere. 

Overall, I was a little disappointed in the room but the price, location, and above all, the amazing pool made up for that. I would probably stay here again for another girls trip (hopefully soon!).",2,0,0

The Flamingo is one of the iconic hotels and is right smack in the middle of the strip so as far as location you couldn't get much better.  It is nice to have a short walk to the strip rather than the customary 1\/4 mile hike that you get at most mega hotel\/casino's.

The lobby area is interesting with all of it's marble and retro decor.  The rooms are dated and a little tired but it's not entirely bad...sort of a throw-back to the Vegas heyday.

The rooms were slightly clean but extremely old and outdated. We had a standard room with two double beds and it was very tight. The bathroom was the size of a tic-tac and we pretty much used the ironing board as a surface to drink from!! Embarassing, yes I know.

The lobby is very ""white"" and somewhat welcoming. However, the whole casino smells of cigarette smoke and old people... the dealers are super friendly though. They make your gambling experience twice as good.

They have really cheap, affordable dining and decent bars to drink from. I couldn't sleep one night and was the only one awake so I went downstairs at 3am and talked it up with the bartender. After 6 coronas and 5am... we pretty much knew each others life stories... I was down about $60 from the beers and tip. At least I slept well

They have nice pools and a nice ""lagoon"" is what they call it I think. It's a nice scenery with a variety of animals, including flamingos of course. They used to have Penguins!! The bartender told me they kept dying cause of the desert climate, duh.

What we did not like is the lack of housekeeping. They never changed our towels, they refolded the ones we had used in the morning which were still damp when we returned to our room in the evening which is how we knew it was the same towels. Sheets were never changed, garbage was never emptied. I had to leave the garbage bag in the hallway for housekeeping to get a clue that they were to remove the garbage. They never replenished the soaps, shampoo or conditioner until the night before we were to check out. And floor in our room was filthy from when we checked in. It hadn't been cleaned from the previous guests. And who knows if it had been cleaned before them. It's a joke when you see house keeping in the hallways with the huge carts with all the bottles of cleaning products, dusters and vacuum cleaners yet they're not using the products when they enter your room.

Another annoying thing is the vending machine in the hallway for water and soda stayed empty. I asked housekeeping our second day there were they ever going to restock the machine and she told me that they're restocked every morning. No, they are not. We checked in on Sunday Aug. 28th, and every day I went to that machine and every day until the day we checked out which was Fri. 9\/01 that machine stayed empty. Ridiculous.

6) The view was awful. I was on the 15th floor and when I peeled open the gross curtains and peered out the HUGE floor to ceiling windows I saw the tops of some undeveloped buildings with trash, mud and dirt caked on. At night the broken Flamingo Hotel neon sign was an attractive sight as well!

7) The cleaning crew were nice enough, although they kept insisting on cleaning the room I was in even after explaining that I had a later check out time than 11am. They tried to come in three times. 

8) The food available in the lobby and throughout the casino is highly over priced and really not worth it. Salads are gross, coffee is mediocre and parfait cups are over $7.00 a piece...

Being surrounded by a cloud of cigarette smoke is just the typical atmosphere of a Las Vegas hotel\/casino. Wandering drunkards is also the norm so these are just facts.

It was a gross experience. 

One final note. I think it's really disgusting to advertise burlesque shows inside the elevators while children are traveling with their parents.

We stayed in one of the new ""GO"" rooms which has a kind of retro feel to it with a padded headboard and striped walls. 
The room had a very nice and comfortable king size pillow top bed with 4 pillows. There was a very nice 42"" Vizio Flat Screen TV. There was also a great sounding top-of-the line sound system, iPod docking station, CD\/DVD player unit. There was a nice size closet with double doors and inside was a safe, iron, full size ironing board and a luggage rack. The windows were from floor to a few inches from the ceiling. They had sheer and heavy curtains that were electronic and ran off two separate switches on the wall next to the bedside. There was a real nice chaise lounge type couch in front of the windows.  There was also a small dorm fridge and an ottoman in the room. 
Now if you like a tub in your room then this would not be to your liking. It did have a excellent shower with glass walls and door.  There were two bonus jets that when turned on shot out of the area by the temp. control handle. There was a T.V. in the bathroom mirror for those who like to watch while they primp. The sink was a beautiful big bowl. The free toiletries were very nice and of higher quality. They supply you with ample towels, hand towels and wash clothes. 
We had a beautiful view of the LV Strip. We were directly across from Caesar's Palace yet we could sit in front of the window in the evenings and watch the fountains at the Bellagio.
The service from the Bellman to the Front Desk to the Restaurants, the the Casino floor was exceptional. I ordered room service a few times and  they were very fast at getting our food to out room.
I would definitely stay here again. Actually I am planning on bringing out my sisters and some friends and staying here for my ""BIG 40"" next year. A great place to stay for the money!!!!!",0,0,0

First of all, the check-in.  There was pretty much a 100+ person line at all times for people waiting to check-in to the hotel.  They had about half the stations opened at any given time.  Inexcusable.  We got one of the nicer rooms, Go Room with High Roller view.  There was a ball of wires hanging from our TV and we called right away to have it fixed... Then we called again several hours later after nobody showed up...  Then we called again the next day, same deal. Then we called the next day and finally after four calls someone showed up to fix it just to let us know it wasn't fixable.  We got a $30 room credit.  

Of the 10 elevators, only half were working so you're constantly waiting to mob the elevators and when you do get on one, some of them have the buttons pried off with wires hanging out.  Not to mention, they are super shaky and really bouncy.  You don't feel safe.  I know the Caesar group is in chapter 11, (which I have absolutely no idea how this could be being that both Caesars and the Flamingo were booked solid in the middle of July) but there's just basic things they weren't doing at the Flamingo.

Yes, the room rate was reasonable, however, after driving from LA, the valet parking and self parking on the Flamingo property was full.  I assume this situation is temporary because there is some ongoing construction, but as a hotel guest, the minimum one can expect is to find parking on the property that you're staying at.  The valet attendant indicated that valet was still open to Diamond members only had to go around the strip and self-parked at Cesar's Palace, not fun after a long drive late at night and had to carry luggage from Cesar's to Flamingo.  Some travel forums indicate that if you tell valet that you are a guest of the hotel, they would take your car, but the valet attendant we interacted with made no such indication.    

The room renovations are very nice, however, the walls seem thin because we could still hear the neighboring room and the heating\/cooling system was loud.  Luckily in Vegas, we didn't spend much time in the room.  Kudos to the housekeeping staff though, the rooms were always clean upon check in and daily housekeeping service.",3,0,0

It was a great location but not a nice hotel. It was my first time in Vegas and I was looking forward to everything going as planned. Turns out it was an extra $30\/night to upgrade to a ""newer"" room. I was very disappointed.  There always has to be something wrong or a catch when we book things online these days.  We did not want to spend any more money on upgrades so decided not to.  The room was clean looking but not really clean.  The website said it would come with many amenities.... but it came with only the basics: soap, shampoo, iron, blow dryer and tv.  No coffee machine or anything else! The carpet was stained and dirty.. i was afraid to go barefoot.  The bathroom was big and clean but the shower curtain was annoying.  The bed was king size and uncomfortable.  Nothing special about the sheets either. I was afraid of bed bugs... our room was far from the elevators but that was expected due to the huge hotel.  The hotel food was horrible.  I rather eat at Mc D's than the burger joint.  The pizza place was decent when the made it fresh.  And there was a scent\/odor by the salon spa and store area... I don't know what it was but it made me nausea everytime we walked by to go to the garage. Almost like a wax smell.  Gross.

We walked and walked and walked to get to our room., which turned out to be less than impressive. The worst thing about it was discovering the heat hadn't worked during the night and it was 60 degrees in there. Also found tiny ants crawling around the bathroom.  
     In the morning we called about the heat but no one ever came to fix it. We ended up switching to a new room, but had to pay the upgrade fee. Moved into a Go Room, which are upgraded but not so special. The bathroom was nice enough with a fancy little tv in the mirror but the frosted glass sliding doors are a nuisance. Not only are they not sound proof but it came off the track on my first close. I called to have it fixed. Guest service rep said they would send someone (which they didn't, because I fixed it later that evening).

However, you cannot justify destroying one of the few remaining icons from old Vegas. Visit the Flamingo if you've never been to Vegas...heck, stay there even. The rooms are decent, but I had a problem with cell phone reception with a pool view room.

If it's your first time in Vegas (as it was mine when I stayed there), let me tell you this: you will be hotel hopping across the strip to check out the interiors - so the hotel you stay in (unless you are getting a suite or having a party in that very hotel) does not really matter.

If you want to stay in a modern, trendy hotel with lots of young people, gourmet buffets, and exciting gambling adventures... this may not be the place to stay.

If you want to pay as little as possible to be in the center of the strip and within walking distance of all of the trendy modern hotels... STAY HERE.   It's located right in the middle of everything, there's easy access to all of the hotels, and you'll have more money to spend on all of the other luxuries of Vegas.

*****Pros:*****
Regular sized rooms (two beds, can fit four people)
Central Location
Clean and comfortable rooms
There is gambling and cheap food on the first floor
They usually have a packaged bundles with Spirit Air (saving you even more $)

*****Cons:*****
It's not young and hip
The rooms are not trendy or that well decorated
The hallways are long and confusing on each floor


Final verdict: I would definitely stay here again if we were going as a group, with some friends, or just going and wanted to save a bunch of money.  

If you're looking for the glamour of Vegas that's shown on TV or in Movies - stay elsewhere.  But I'll warn you... prepare to spend a LOT more.",9,1,1

Maybe it's because I grew up poor and a ""nasty"" hotel to me is a motel 6 in the ghetto, but we had a perfectly acceptable experience with the Flamingo this past week, starting with the check in on Thursday afternoon (3\/10). 

The check-in would be my only beef with the place, since they are very much aware it can take 30-90 min waiting in line, yet they do not add more reps behind the counter. We were lucky and it only took about 25 min to get up to the desk. 

** The Total Rewards kiosk does not let you check in if you are a new member **  

I read so many tips to sign up at the kiosk and ask to be checked in, and was excited to show off my trick to my man friend, but we asked two Total Rewards reps if we could check in at the Kiosk, and they both said no. Maybe they only let low tiers check in during super crazy wait times.. I donno. But either way, being a TR member cant hurt, so just do it. And the Gold card is glitttttery! We ended up getting $3 off our hotel bill at the end after redeeming points which, for no effort, ain't too shabby. Shows you how little money we spent on TR partners\/gambling, though, heh. 

But yeah, we only waited 25 min and our front desk lady was SO nice. She'd been at the Flamingo for 7 years, I think? She recommended the Yard House nearby, which was awesome! (go during happy hour and get the Vampire taco). 

I figured since we were there on a timeshare presentation deal they would just stick us in the worst of the worst rooms, but I was pleasantly surprised with our Fab room on the 19th floor. Wood laminate floors, plenty of counter space in the bathroom, and the bed was a fricken normal bed. No stains, cockroaches, busted windows or anything to complain about.  Yes, the showers are not Bellagio standard, but hey.. just dont have Bellagio standards at Flamingo prices and you be fine. 

I saw a lot of complaints about the elevators, but we had no problems whatsoever. It did get pretty busy last Saturday of our stay, but we never had to wait longer than a minute for an elevator, and no weird hocus pocus shit happened on the way down. 

Oh, and there was no coffee maker in the Fab room, which was kind of disappointing, but I got my fill of coffee at the time share (which I totally recommend doing for perks if you are not gullible). 

Other than that, the Flamingo is a great location in the middle of the strip, and the blackjack tables have awesome side bet rules, so we raked in the cash (Margaritaville has $5 min limit with same rules, whereas we could only find $10 minimum tables at Flamingo). 

I would definitely stay here again!",5,4,3

1. Unclean rooms. We booked 2 rooms. 1st room had one bed, when we had requested two. The bed was messed up, there was trash on the floor. 2nd room was a handicapped room which was fine except I hope that someone who actually was handicapped did not miss out. 3rd room had two beds but both had been rolled around in and dirty towels in the bathroom. 4th room reeked of weed, but otherwise ""clean"" and thereby deemed acceptable at 4am until they could get us a room on the same floor as the other one the next day. We got in at 11:30pm and went through 4 rooms that were not clean or able to be slept in in 4 hours. Meaning although we paid for a room on Friday, there was not a clean one available.

2. Unaccommodating service. 1 out of 3 front desk agents were friendly. We did not hear an apology for any of the dirty rooms and when my friend asked for compensation they acted like they didn't know why. They reluctantly gave us a $30 voucher for a hotel restaurant. Whoopee.

3. Slow service at the Mexican restaurant in the casino. Also, guest services said they were open until 2am on Sunday after the marathon. Nope. They turned on all the lights before midnight.

4. When cashing in our $30 voucher, my friend had to sign her name and put our room number. The server at the restaurant misunderstood (or not) and charged my friend $30 EXTRA to the room.

There are so many more reasons I could name to skip over this hotel when planning a trip for Vegas, but the cheap price is not worth it. Other guests that we knew also had problems with their rooms (leaky toilet and shower) and with rude staff.

Why people stay at the Flamingo:

- it's central on the Strip (really its only saving grace)
- it's cheaper
- it has a convenient small food court

The flamingos in the courtyard were cool, but walk through as you pass to your better even if a tad more expensive hotel. Do not stay at the Flamingo unless it's for free. And even then, I'd think twice.",9,2,2

I had booked a pet room as I was traveling with my dog and after checking in and dropping all my stuff off in the room I went in search of a place to take my dog so he could ""do his business"".  I walked up and down the hallway near my room with my dog on his leash to try and find an employee who could tell me where to take him.  The three people I ran into first didn't speak English.  The next employee I ran into didn't think they had an area (real intelligent, you have pet rooms but no outside pet area, that makes a whole lot of sense....).  So finally after about an hour of just wandering the hotel I finally found it.  No thanks to any of the employees.

The other thing that irritated me was that when the Bell Hop was loading all my stuff out of my car he said that he didn't have room to take my dog's carrier right then and that I could try calling back after 7:00 pm once it slowed down a bit.  Um, I'm sorry but I thought your job was to take whatever I wanted up to my room.  Not that you'll get the easy stuff and then inconvenience me by making me wait to get the other stuff that you don't feel like loading right now.

The only reason that I'm giving the Flamingo 2 stars instead of 1 is because the room service food was good and the valet was free.

(1) The Room: I read some pretty awful things on here about the regular rooms so I opted to stay in a Go Room.  DEFINITELY worth the extra money.  The room was very nice with a very large shower, pink lights in the bathroom, and awesome view of the strip.  I could see the bellagio fountain show from my room each night I was there.  If you are going to stay here, Go Room is definitely the way to go.

(2) The Casino: Nothing special.  The theme is interesting but it is like any other casino on the strip.

(3) The Buffet: You are better off going to a nicer buffet.  I went for lunch and there were more dessert selections than there were entree selections.

(4) The Pool: AWESOME.  The pool was fairly large and had a slide that kept kids and adults occupied.   Because of the various slides, children stayed more towards one end of the pool and adults were mostly on the other.  The waterfalls were great and the drinks were pretty strong.  The only annoying thing was that you weren't allowed to bring in your own food or drinks.

tv in the bathroom mirror, super hot shower (sad that i only discovered the jets on the last day but THERE ARE JETS), separate bath.

It remains an iconic front to Sin City, an all encompassing resort with the cheese of a gimmick theme without the sleaze of downtown. 

Until the hideous Imperial Palace (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/imperial-palace-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas) came into the Harrah's \/ Caesars family, it was the lower end of the property totem pole and often the butt of many jokes in today's contemporary resort renaissance. The corny decor, the antiquated amenities, and the lack of anything substantial in the resort sense has made it a lower end property. And that's precisely why I like it.

Given its location, the Flamingo is very budget friendly in every sense of the word. The occupancy rate is likely to be high, considering its awesome low prices during the week and doable rates on the weekend. The regular rooms are comfortable and semi-spacious, not nearly as junky as early perception would lead on otherwise. There is good value in their higher end suites and in an attempt to modernize their hotel game, the GO rooms and FAB rooms will definitely surprise people with how contemporary and sophisticated they are.

Barring no plans for renovation, the casino is predictably small. There are a good number of table games with a heavy emphasis on black jack (Spanish 21 is also available), various poker games, and craps + roulette. Slots, whose inventory makes up the bulk of most casinos is lacking in inventory compared to their property counterparts, but rest assured most games will be available, though perhaps *unavailable* when there are too many grannies plopping down to build on their player comps if you catch my drift. WIth regards to comps, TotalReward points are easier to apply here but accumulation will be the same anywhere.

All forms of dining are going to be close to lackluster or borderline horrendous. If there is any dignity left in your palate, you'll do your best to skip any outlet of food here unless you're in a dire situation. Snobby eaters, wannabe foodies, or anyone with tastebuds aren't soon to be caught  dead eating at Hamada of Japan (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/hamada-of-japan-las-vegas-2) or Paradise Garden Buffet (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/paradise-garden-buffet-las-vegas), or any of the Margaritaville, LA Subs, Johnny Rocket spots within their sad food court. Is there a worse Mexican restaurant than Carlos n' Charlies (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/carlos-n-charlies-las-vegas-2) on the entire strip? When Taco Bell owns you, that's when you know there is a problem.

The best thing at the Flamingo for me, is the pool. Some might call it one of the better pools on the strip and locals tend to come here more often than not. There is no elaborate nightlife centered around the pool, just good people watching, sufficient space to swim or float in, and quality pool side service for all things outdoor.

And of course, for a (cheesy) photo op or children's activity, visit the Flamingos when weather appropriate. After all, like any great college or pro team, a brand is nothing without a proper mascot.",14,8,11

But honestly, you get what you pay for. Staying in Las Vegas for 200 for 4 nights is a great deal, and it will attract enough people that the Flamingo doesn't need help reviews to sustain itself.

For the price, I will say that the location is pretty great. You are in the middle of the strip and you get a lot of action on both ends. Plus you are very close to some pretty amazing casinos and hotels.

I think this goes without saying but this place is kitschy. It's cheesy and I just really didn't care for the decor: even though the place is updated it still reeks of 80s Las Vegas. 

Finally, the customer service is HORRIBLE.  I have never been to a hotel that doesn't provide you with the accommodations you request. Such as a king size bed. Usually when you book a place you book either a king or two queens\/doubles. My boyfriend and I were stuck with two doubles.

On the positive side, the room was very clean and spacious, and the beds were very comfortable. It has a very retro 80's feeling with the black, white, and hot pink. 

I thought it was weird that the floor didn't have any carpet though, it was a textured vinyl linoleum, which wasn't awful but I think carpet is so much better and feels more cozy and comfortable. We were also staying in a room that wasn't fully renovated, meaning that the bathroom wasn't renovated at all, there was paint chipping off of the 50 year old sink (probably exaggerating, but it was very dated). Also, the TV was about five sizes too small for the room, so it was very weird to watch, not that anyone goes to Las Vegas to watch TV, but on the off chance that anyone does, just know that the TV is tiny. The pool also closes at 6? Most people don't even get to their hotels until four or five at the earliest, I have never heard of any pool closing that early.

I would have to say that the absolute worst part of staying there was that check in took an hour. We got there at 7:30 on a Monday, it was just a little ridiculous, I've stayed in Las Vegas Labor Day weekend, which is a very busy weekend, and never had to wait that long at all. Next to that figuring out where to park was another hassle. The casino next door was being torn down, which happened to also be where the front entrance and check in for the Flamingo was, but there was no signage as to where we had to go instead. We had to take a chance and go down some random street that led to a parking garage and thankfully it ended up being where the Flamingo entrance was. It would have just been a little helpful if on the reservation confirmation the hotel had said that there was construction going on and the entrance was somewhere other than where is should have been.

Overall there are better places to stay in Vegas, you are going to spend the money anyways so why not spend it on one of the nicer hotels, even Bally's is a lot nicer. Or if you don't want to spend more money on one of the fancy hotels just book a room at one of the hotels that's not directly on the strip. It's still walking distance or a very short cab ride, but the hotel is cheaper.",1,0,0

Checking in was quick and ok; however once we got to our room find out our keys did NOT work!
Hallway carpeting was filthy, smelly and ruffled. In major need of new carpeting. Not in one little spot but our entire floor hallway  had huge wrinkles\/waves. I'm surprised management let this go since this is a major lawsuit waiting to happen. 
Room was updated however sink faucet had major leak that damaged counter top, shower\/tub was kinda gross.

The casino is small and quite boring.  So why do I stay here?  Well, first of all, due to my Total Rewards card, I get comps here.  When I don't they are cheap.  The rooms are clean and big.  The location is pretty good.  Cheap table games are hard to find on the strip, but they can be found here.  Dealers are nice and remember me.  Parking is terrible here and often the valet is full.

I didn't know what to expect. My first impression was very, very poor. The bathroom was disgusting. The bathtub looked dirty. It had nasty stains. Do people at this hotel not know how to clean?? I turned on the bathtub faucet, black-brown water came out. Nasty. The toilet was pathetic. Do they expect people to flush the toilet and wait decades for the water to rise to use it again? People have things to do and places to be. The sink only had freezing cold water. No hot water at all! So we called to tell them about our issue. During the conversation, I mistakenly thought the woman asked me where our room was located. I told her the location, but she said in a condescending, rude, disrespectful tone, ""Noooooo, I have an Asian name."" This woman needs to be fired. You can't talk to a customer like this. What a joke! I still remember the day and time this happened! In our case, the best thing to do is request for a room switch because this was plain unacceptable. The woman I talked to said that she's unable to switch us to another room at the moment, but maybe tomorrow. Since she couldn't switch us to another room, she said she'll have someone come to our room to fix our problem, but it'll take X amount of time to get someone up there. X amount of time went by. No one arrived. We called back, we clearly mentioned that we had to go and won't be in the room during that time because we had a venue to catch. They said they'll have someone fix our problem for us when we're gone. We go on our merry way, came back that same night, went straight to the lobby area and told them about our situation. We were told that there should be a note on the door if someone stopped by to fix the issue. NOPE, NOTHING. We called again. FINALLY, someone came up to check out the problem. He checked and said that nothing can be done. DUH, that's why we need to switch to another room. Who is going to use the shower in a nasty bathtub, use a toilet that doesn't work properly, and use a sink with no hot water. What is it they don't understand? This place is gross!

The next morning, we called to tell them about our situation AGAIN. It got so tiring having to explain what's going on over and over again without any resolution. They still didn't know if they could switch us to another room, but will let us know. We had plans that same day and didn't get back until later that evening. This time, we went to the lobby and talked to the person that assigned us this room in the first place. He automatically apologizes profusely and switched us to another room ASAP! OMG, FINALLY!!! So how come this person was able to switch us to another room right away upon request while the others did not??!!? Sheeesh! I'm very upset that we had to jump through hoops at the beginning of our trip just to get a room that was clean with running hot water! Even though I'm very happy that someone actually helped us out, but it was after several complaints with the staff just making up BS and making us run in circles! I didn't find the staff to be helpful. Majority of them were rude and unfriendly. Paying customers shouldn't be treated like dirt. I didn't expect this place to be a fancy hotel, but at least keep it clean and usable. Most importantly, treat your customers with respect!! 

From my experience, staying at Flamingo was a huge mistake! I would never ever in my entire life stay at this hotel ever again. It was the worst experience ever!!! I wouldn't even give Flamingo a single star. It's a big negative to me! This hotel was downright nasty. Nasty place, horrible staff.

I haven't been back in that place since, until last week.  It seemed a bit nicer back in the day.  It's a bit dingy now, and walking in from the parking garage you get hit with a wall of stale smoky air reminiscent of a smoking room at a Super 8 Motel.  Blech.  Circulation is better once you make it through the hall.  The layout is confusing, but I was able to enjoy a few Sam Adams on tap at the bar with the owner of my company who had just flown in from Germany so that was nice.

I saw THREE disgusting rooms then checked OUT.

1) The slowest hotel check in on the planet because EVERYONE WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT SOMETHING.  I almost left, but I had already pre-booked via Hotels.com and I was tired.
2) RUDE staff woman checked me.  I asked a few questions about bell service and SHE DID NOT ANSWER me, just threw a card at me and said ""here's what your resort fee includes.""  Wow. I explained I was in Vegas solo, strictly for a business conference. I just wanted a fairly quiet room-didn't care about beds. She so graciously found an ADJOINING SUITE room.  OMG. I was in the room 5 minutes and thank God the people next store walked in right away.  I could hear them BREATHING. It was like they were in the same room with me!  RIDICULOUS.

3) I phoned the front desk stayed on hold for 10 minutes. They said they found me another room.  This room was FILTHY DIRTY. I have pictures to prove. 
* Sex ""Protein"" stains on the ugly duvet on the beds. 
* Pubic hairs ALL OVER THE SINK
* Filthy, barely rinsed UNSANITIZED, filthy glasses on the sink.
* Sink counter was FILTHY.  Floors were FILTHY.
So what did I do?  I called bell service and went BACK downstairs walking through the halls on the vile NASTY, filthy carpet that is THROUGHOUT the ENTIRE HOTEL.  
4) I agreed to try one more room. THE THIRD ROOM: The ""manager"" said she would send up maid service to confirm the cleanliness.  I got to the room.  And CHECK OUT THIS PHOTO:
 IT WAS OCCUPIED!!!  SOMEONE'S BAGS WERE IN THERE!  I HAD A KEY TO ANOTHER GUEST'S ROOM and walked in!!  There's ONE FOR HOTEL SECURITY ala  Flamingo. UNBELIEVABLE!!  

Phoned Bell boy #3 and went to the front desk. The hotel wouldn't give my money back.  Said I had to go through hotels.com, which was A LIE as Hotels.com reached them and the Flamingo hotel told Hotels.com that they would not return my charges.  I told Hotels.com CHARGEBACK on my Visa card was coming. So, Hotels.com obliged and returned my charges.
Through my entire ordeal, the hotel was UNAPOLOGETIC and just acted like they had heard ALL OF MY COMPLAINTS before.  As a matter of fact the THREE Bell Boys I had during this, CONFIRMED THE problems I expressed!! 
The departure::: was that I had to INSIST and ask THREE different people at front desk to get me a folio that showed ZERO was charged to my credit card because the GUEST IN MY ROOM, could have ordered up a bottle of SCOTCH and it would have been CHARGED TO ME!!! SHADY.  NASTY. FILTHY. DO NOT STAY HERE. I am also reporting this to the appropriate Las Vegas commissions as well.

When we called to book our rooms. We told them we need 2 rooms, 2 beds each, non-smoking, and a fridge. We have an elder, baby and toddlers. The lady confirmed it will not be a problem over the phone. She will make notes in the system for us so when we arrive all will be set. We called again the day prior to arriving to confirm. They said that's what they have and just ask again at front desk. We arrive 2 hours later than we thought due to crazy traffic. Front desk said they have no non-smoking rooms for us, only one bed each and the rooms are not connecting. Also on different floors from our 3rd room we called in. After complaining about the mess. The supervisor came and he was even worst. Said he cannot guarantee my request because of the time I arrive there. Their policy is always first come first serve. If so I do not know why I was ask so many questions about what kind of preference I want in a room?!? I said I have babies with me and must have a non-smoking room. His comments was ""I can't give you what I do not have. You do know you're in a casino smoking or non-smoking will most likely be the same"". WTH!! I receive no apologies and no accommodation to offset this frustration at all. On top of that I waited until 2am for them to deliver my fridge that's going to be charge $15 per night. 

My family member talked to a gentlemen who was complaining about the front desk staff and them putting him in a handicap room. He went to complain and they switch him up for a suite. And yet they cannot even do anything for me when I have young kids and elderly with me!!!!!!! What kind of hotel that allow heartless supervisors to run this place. One of my son had a stuffy nose from inhaling the bad smell in the room and feeling sick all weekend and not enjoying the weekend at all. 

If only I didn't know about the gentlemen and if only they would be more apologetic about this I would just let it go and not write anything about them. But the front desk supervisor sound so proud when he talk about their policy and make me feel stupid. To find a man getting what he want after complaining about getting a handicap room which he does not like the shower and he gets upgraded to a suite! Ridiculous!!!!!!!!

We are big fans of the Go rooms, the adults only pool ( The large pool is now strictly 18 and older) and it's location on the strip. By and large we spent hardly anytime at all in the casino itself.  Do wish it had a cool bar or lounge.  

Plenty of Yelpers have added some helpful hints, but thought we would pass on a few too.

Check in: Might be worth using the desk vs. the quick computer check in.  We tried the quick check in and ended up staying in the Habitat tower....last year stayed in the Spa tower and enjoyed the layout a little more. The Habitat tower is guarded by Westin employees trying to give you a ""free"" gift.  Not a deal breaker, but ask for the spa tower Go rooms.  By all means, BOOK A GO ROOM.

Pool:  Don't expect to easily get a lounge chair if you show up past 10AM.  Think people run down to the pool and put towels on them at first light...play the game and do the same!  Grab a bloody mary while you are down there....they are awesome and only $5  from 8-11AM. The waitresses at the pool are swamped with orders, but all the ones we had the pleasure of talking to were super cute..I mean super sweet and helpful! If your hungry, order a burger!  Very filling and it goes well with the $20 bucket of beer.  Jeannie enjoyed the turkey wrap.  Tried the hotdog.  It had some major shrinkage going on ( supposed to be a Nathan's) and ended up filling up mostly on the fries.

Margaritaville: Stepped in there for the first time...for breakfast on the day we checked out.  A good bet and the price is on the low end for Vegas.  Have to try the bar one night...

Late night snack.  There is a food court ( two actually) that has a Johnny Rockets, a pizza place, a Panda Express-like joint and a sub  & salad place.  Had a pizza night cap twice and it was goooooood! Sausage and Pepperoni slice hit the spot.

Location:  There are so many entertainment and food options near by that you might want to be prepared to walk just a little.  Venetian & the Mirage are just within  comfortable walking distance (heels might be a challenge ladies) Harrah's & Caesar's are easy! Didn't really go the other direction, but think about keeping the car parked.  A much more colorful trip will be had on foot as you get a close up view of the Vegas ""humanity"".",3,0,2

I stayed at the Flamingo from 8\/14-8\/20\/2013 and I loved it, despite all the negative reviews.

First thing, GET A TOTAL REWARDS CARD, if you fail to obtain one prior to check-in you more than likely will be waiting a significant amount of time in line.  If you are 7star\/Diamond\/gold member they have a separate line for them, for example, I am a gold member and was able to bypass the line and check-in immediately.  

POOL: 5\/5

Pros----Amazing pool, PARTY atmosphere, only a small section that is in the shade for half the day the rest is in the sun all day, great party music, weekends have booty shaking contest, Ages range is typical 20-30s, but plenty of ages enjoying the fun atmosphere.  Tropical style setting: palm trees, water fall.  Towels for flamingo guests

Cons:  PACKED on weekends, get there early (8am) if you want a great seat, if not you will be hunting for spots to sit.  However I was able to get seats later in the day when the second wave of people began showing (2pm).  Bathroom for men has only 3 toilets, kinda sucks when a line forms.  Drink lines can get lengthy.  $ for drinks are expensive but who cares you're in Vegas.

ROOM: 4\/5

Ok First night I was upgraded to a GO room because my KING FAB LUX w\/STRIP VIEW was unavailable at the time.  We arrived at 12am and the guy at the check in was super cool.  GO room was awesome, clean, classy, no issues. 

Pros:  KING FAB LUX w\/stip; 22130 , great view of strip.  Room was clean, no bugs, Maid service everyday, new towels brought, Bed was comfy, (go room had a nicer bed)  I didnt feel disgusted in the room like how some of the reviews had mentioned.  Overall satisfied with my experience!

Cons:  minor wear in bathroom, lighting was slightly rushed, door scratched, carpet outside the room slightly worn.  Pressure in shower a little low, but was able to get clean no problem.  None of the imperfections in the room would make me NOT want to stay there again.  Walls thin, could hear people talking loudly occasionally.  Again who cares, you're in Vegas to have a GREAT TIME!!

Casino\/Atmosphere\/Food 4\/5

Pros:  Outside flamingo atmosphere is so nice, so relaxing looking at all the water, ecology, and trees, plenty of shade, plenty of great spots for pictures, just a real vacation feel, loved it.    Food choices in food-court low, only 4 restaurants, but were great for a snack or quick bite, $ ok.  Casino as we all know is older but still fun, They have a Maragrittaville in there and that is AWESOME, food was fantastic.

Cons:  The casino is older, construction between flamingo and ballys is a pain\/loud, cab service not very great because of the road cutting through flamingo is closed so cabs have to drive around to pick up\/drop off.  One elevator did not work.  Again, nothing in this place would make me not want to come back.  

Conclusion:
-  Look if you book here expecting it to be like a Cesars or Belligio quality casino then you are foolish person.  It was a great experience, I have no idea why so many people complain about this place.  If you don't like to party, loud noise, immature\/funny people, fun atmosphere, meeting new people then Flamingo is not your place.  If however you do, you will be pleasantly surprised as I was.  I never write reviews but after reading all these picky, mean, snooty reviews about this place I had to tell my story.  


Hope this helps for the future flamingo guests!!",9,1,4

We stayed here over Memorial Weekend 2010 and had a fantastic time. My girlfriend booked our stay and opted to get us a GO room which on the 17th floor overlooking the garden and pool area. 

As stated in some of the other reviews; super clean room with modern decor. Nice big plasma tv, super clean, super white sheets on the king bed. I liked the extra ammenities, such as: the remote operated celestial openings (curtains and shades) 

We didn't spend a lot of time in the room as it is Vegas- hellooo! But the bed was super comfy, so comfy I'm tempted to call the Flamingo and ask them the brand of that bed and get one for my house too. Best sleep I've had in ages... 

The door to the bathroom was cool. It was a frosted glass and the pink bathroom lighting illuminated it in a strange, eerie, psychedelic glow.

I would have however, liked to have had a soaking tub for two in there, rather than a glass shower for two. If you're a reader like I am when you're sitting on that white chair, yet you have nothing to read, don't fret, There's an lcd tv built into the mirror and viewability is still pretty good from the angle. However, the remote control to the bathroom tv was rather dirrty looking.

The cleaning staff were extremely friendly and provided us with a small travel toothpaste, but only after we tipped her well... 

One thing I found odd was there there were no Do Not Disturb Tags to be found for our door (or any other door for that matter). So the cleaning folk would barge on in, it at god awful hours (before 9am) in the morning. Also there was no free WiFi in the rooms, only a LAN connection with a limited number of megabytes and a rather high fee. 

On Saturday we strolled down to the all ages pool but couldn't find a place so we went to the GO POOL 21 and over only, women were free and guys was $15 for hotel guests. That kinda sucked but once in there and drinking I forgot all about the $15, plus since we can't stand whiny children and crying we throughly enjoyed the adult only pool area. The swimming pool was out of this world, it was like an MTv spring break episode. Young hard bodies galore. If I was a high roller, I would have gotten a cabana, but in all was a fantastic holiday.",3,0,1

We upgraded to a GO room facing the strip and it was worth it. Nicely updated and modern. The bummer is, the windows have giant decals on them so the view is somewhat obscured, like looking through mesh. I wanted to stare down at the action on the strip below or watch the Bellagio fountain but I can hardly do it without going cross eyed. If I had to do it over I might just face the pool instead, where you can get a clean view.

It's worth noting, that the huge main pool is only open to people 21 and older. We only found this out as we walked up to the pool, towels in hand, and were turned away. We were redirected to the kid-friendly pool which was much smaller. It was still nice but we were disappointed.

DATES: Stayed 5 nights over Memorial Day Weekend

RESERVATIONS: Booked through Caesars; exceptional customer service; booked room, later found out rates dropped, called Caesars, and they honored the lower price, saving me over $100

ROOM: We stayed in a King, Non-smoking Room.   After booking the hotel, I read reviews of the hotel and was very nervous for my stay.  While some fears did not materialize, others were noticeable.  The toilet in our room refilled itself every 30 minutes that included a loud banging noise.  The walls are paper thin so pray your neighbors are the cute, old couple on their 50th anniversary.  The shower overflowed every time it was used spilling out into our room requiring us to use multiple towels to clean up.  One of the lamps was unplugged, some of the electrical sockets didn't work, and one electrical socket was missing a socket cover (Fire & Safety Hazard).

STAFF: Friendly, although besides the casino area, they seem understaffed for such a large resort.

HOTEL: The renovated hallways look very nice although guests placed garbage in the hallway which, at times, stayed in the hallway for over 24 hours, even though housekeeping was in the hallways from 8am to 5pm.  If you have a fear of elevators, don't test out their hotel elevators; they've clearly seen better days and need to be tested for safety (at times it felt like we were going to plummet 10 stories).

PROXIMITY:  The Flamingo is right on the Vegas Strip.  It is in a VERY convenient location to everything.

CASINO: Smoker-friendly.  Their HVAC system is fairly good, so the smell and haze barely exists.  Tables range from $10+ per hand.

POOL: Free for hotel guests.  We loved the pool (although Bally's has a bigger\/nicer pool).

GYM: Basic gym with standard equipment.  Free for hotel guests.

WIFI: It's free for 2 devices; although it moves at a glacial pace at times.",4,0,0

It has some good things going for it, some bad things, and some ugly things. I stayed here because of a work convention that was located here.  Let's get started:

The good:  My view.  I got the king room Go.  They gave me one on the top floor overlooking the strip.  It was fantastic.  Check in and Check out.  Guy at the front desk was great checking in.  Uber showed up too fast so I checked out via email which went flawlessly.  Directions!  Finally casinos actually put up signs to help you get through the maze and get where you want to go without hoping you will get lost.  Some of the specials.  Margaritaville had 5 cent beers from 5 - 6.  Location.  Made everything on the strip accessible by walking. The Wi-Fi.  It was some of the fastest I have experienced in a hotel, and I travel for work most of the time.

The Bad:  The smoke.  Every time you walked through the lobby or the Casino you smelt like an ash tray.  Not sure why Vegas is so behind on the smoking laws.  The restaurants.  Geared for the lower middle class that loves chains and bland food.  Margaritaville, Carlos and Charlie's, and Tilted Kilt are all sub par options.  Maybe it is good if you are going for a bachelor party or 21st birthday and you smoke.  The water pressure.  I have a 32"" waist and had to lean against the shower diverter to get under the water.  Once the water completely stopped while I was in the middle of lathering...  leaving me wondering if there was a quarter slot I missed to get the water to start again.  The carpet.  20 years old and in really bad shape.  Such sad little carpet.

The ugly:  The resort fee.  Biggest ripoff in hoteldom worldwide.  $32.50.  And not just $32.50 it's $32.50 per night.  So for my 5 night stay I paid $162.50 for the ability to make local calls, use Wi-Fi, and up to 2 visits to the weight room daily. And it's automatic, you have no choice one the matter. That per stay would be fine, given the speed of the Wi-Fi I experienced, but per night is ridiculous.  I understand they did it to counter some of the third party sights giving their room away (So if you book an express deal on Priceline be prepared to still pay this), but if you don't like it, don't use their sites as advertising and a spot to sell your rooms.  The TOLIET PAPER.  Says is it green and recycled.  Which means your whipping your rear with newspaper.  Thin see through newspaper at that.  Honestly, it was worse than the TP at the airport or a high school.

Overall this place is overpriced for what it offers, and I would say I would be hard pressed to select this place again on a return trip to Vegas.  Way too many other, better, and nicer options out there.",5,2,1

I do not feel safe here security and evacuation procedures are not in place. On Monday September 8th around 4:15 on the 28th floor the fire alarm went off. After trying to call the front desk (got put on hold) we got dressed and left our room about 5 minuets later and ran into a frantic woman in the hallway with no idea what to do. We proceeded to head down the stairs (which were not labeled well very small exit sign. There was no alarm in the stair well, no signage for emergency procedure and no way to know what was going on. No security in the stair well, nothing. Once we got down to the 2nd floor we hit a dead end there was a locked door and one that led to a roof again not very much signage, yellow arrows on the ground not very visible with the 2in of rain flooding the roof. After much confusion we reached another stair well and got outside. We got downstairs and the first 3 hotel employees we spoke with had no idea there was an alarm going off. This includes a hotel manager. She offered to change our rooms gave us $50 to spend at the hotel and passed us off to another front desks assistant Melinda who was very nice and undertaking. After continuing to voice our concern, worry and still shaking she informed us that it was a false alarm (which we would have known if there were alarms and speakers in the stairs). We asked to speak to a manager again because the first woman had gone home. This is when things took a turn for the worse. Ryan Ramsey came our flat faced and dry nodding quietly to my friends concerns only escalating our frustration. He interrupted her, told her we weren't getting an upgrade and said he didn't know what else to do, it wasn't his fault there weren't enough security guards. We were trying to voice our concern about security procedures and he made us feel stupid. He didn't smile apologize or even try to de escalate the situation he gladly handed over his ""managers"" business card and seemed glad to pass the burden along. All we were trying to do is show our perspective in the faults in security and emergency procedures at the hotel and he didn't seem to care.

My biggest complaint is that the hotel is more concerned with being politically correct than protecting its guests as my husband witnessed an outrageous assault of another guest and it took 20 minutes for the 'aged' security guard to arrive. Instead of removing the attacker security was more interested in smoothing things over and pretending it didn't happen. Security was even ridiculous enough to ask for names and room#s in front of assailant. The attack was without merit (had witnesses) and the individual should have been immediately escorted from the premises- in this day and age especially. Not sure of the country of origin of this attacker  but let's just say- there should be a zero tolerance policy on any assault.

I arrived around 4:00pm and the line was long, as expected. My boyfriend and I decided to play in the casino. Between 4:30pm and 5:30pm, my boyfriend and I went to use the restroom near the theatre. I walked in one stall where the toilet hadn't been flushed, so I went to use the next open stall. That stall had an employee cleaning so I turned back around to go to the initial stall. The employee, Kyung, told me ""go to the other side"" in an abrasive tone. I asked why, she said ""because I'm cleaning"" I said ""you're not cleaning all these stalls at the same time"". She started to waive her broom around and said ""you need to go to the other side"" (please keep in mind, there was no closure of the hall) that's when her disgusting bathroom broom swiped me across the knee. I told her to not hit me with her broom and asked her name. She said ""it doesn't matter"" (she did not have a name tag).

Our flight came in early and we tried to check in right around their check out time. Our Strip View Go Room with a King Size Bed was not ready yet. We checked back a few hours later in the kiosk and it was still not ready. By 3:30 we got in line for 4pm check in and we were rudely told that they do not have any Strip View GO Rooms with a king size bed. They were sold out.  We reserved THAT room type on Total Rewards. How could they be SOLD OUT?? She was ready to give us a Strip view room with 2 queen size beds.  We were not happy and started to argue. They then tried to downgrade us. The first downgrade was a GO Room but handicapped and not Strip view. When we still refused, then she tried downgrading us to a High Roller room that was not Strip view either. When we refused that, the manager came. Guest Services acted so fake like a bunch of automated robots. The manager told us to come back tomorrow to see if the room we reserved becomes available. Given we were in town for seminars and already waiting all day for a room, we were not going through the same thing the next day, that was NOT going to happen.  I was ready to cancel and go to Mirage, but we ended up taking the Strip view Go Room with the 2 queen beds and a lousy $30 food and drink coupon. If Flamingo had any class they should have comped us a night and got us in the proper room on a priority level the next day. So BEWARE, apparently there is a legal clause that they don't guarantee your room option. I have never heard of such.  We travel a lot and have never had an issue like this, we've always gotten what we reserved and paid for. Expedia is probably a better option. At least it is prepaid and they can't mess with your reservation. We have stayed here at least 4 times now and this may be our last given how bad we were treated. For the record, the beds are terrible and there was hair on the mattress and lipstick stains on the ceiling. The bathroom size was nice with a nice shower, but the sink drain was all clogged up and disgusting. I love the floor to ceiling windows at Flamingo. We had a view of a roof, Drais, and the corner of the fountains, which would have been better if the fountains were actually on for more than just 1 evening of our stay. I'm strongly considering sending a letter to the CEO over their poor treatment though. We've been coming to Vegas for years and never had any issues like this anywhere on the Strip. I want to like this hotel but this particular stay was just a terrible experience. My two stars are one for location and 1 for the windows and nice shower.",0,1,0

We settled on The Flamingo because of its' location.  We arrived at approx. 12:30 AM.  Upon finally locating the valet area, we were advised by a Flamingo Hotel employee that we were at the wrong Valet lot.  He told us that if we wanted help with luggage that he would call a bellman.  Approx 30 min. Later, the lone bellman showed up.  His immediate statement, ""Sorry Man, I'm working two lots by myself.""  After he took our luggage, I was told that I would have to take my vehicle to the correct Valet lot.  I proceeded to the correct Valet lot and then waited 30 min. before I was helped!  I forget to mention that my wife got in the check-in line at 1:00 AM.  It took until 2:00 AM to check in.  I think that had everything to do with the fact that there was only two employees working at the desk!!!!  After finally checking in, we located the elevators only to discover that only two were operational!!!  Once at the room, we opened the door and immediately smelled the strong odor of Marijuana!  We called the front desk and no one answered.  After the third try and 20 rings later, someone answered.  Their FIX:  They sent someone from housekeeping to spray a deodorizing agent that did not remove the smell!  We called the front desk and asked to move rooms.  Their response was that they were sold out!!! We stayed in a GO Deluxe room.  The room was okay.  It felt old and dirty.  Again, the main complaint about the room was the smell of Marijuana!!!

The Icing on the cake: 

At the end of the trip, Valet brought our brand new (452 miles)  2015 Honda Civic out from Valet.  It had a door ding on the r\/f passenger door!  Wow!!  They had security come down and take a report.  They said to call The Flamingo risk management in three days.  I waited one week and called.  Left a message for who knows who!!! No call back after one week!!!

No one at the Flamingo Hotel cares!

Pros: the service members at the doors dressed in black who are a wealth of valuable location information. We later asked someone the quickest route and he confirmed ""quickest? Or warmest?"" As he noticed we didn't have heavy jackets. It was a consideration that showed me he had our best interest in mind. Self parking is still offered which can be nice if you plan to go in and out during your stay. 

Cons: express check in system issues. For one reason or another the check in kiosk was showing our room still wasn't ready even though it was nearly 8pm. When we got in line to speak with someone in person, the line moved very slowly as they took a lot of higher reward members ahead of us. self parking is in the back meaning if you're coming from the strip you have to pass through the mass of people walking along the sidewalk which can take some time.

Room fine; nonsmoking did not have smoke; cool pool (but zillions of people much of the time); grounds in rear nice. Chapel should be considered if marrying - not great, but somewhat private-ish and serene.

Business center internet 100% nonfunctional and customer service phone there was out of order.  No personnel to help, possibly on entire floor. Found a janitor to give me a number for business center support, and it said for me to sit there for 45 mins. to 2 hours when an outside contractor could be located and sent. I asked ""Terri"" at front desk, what can they do for me, and while I secretly hoped I'd get $20 gambling credit while I waited, I was shocked that she blasted *me* for the Flamingo Las Vegas's ineptness. Unbelievable. If you saw it you'd be shocked too (as were patrons waiting in line as I passed them).

She wasn't the only unfriendly, unprofessional front desk person. And in case you think this is a whine, read my stock. I praise and reward good service, am neutral for average, and believe me, three at their front desk (mostly ""Terri"") should be banned from all forms of customer service employment. Though that's a fictional request, they truly are that bad.

I also asked a random customer at the pay-slot internet kiosk near tower elevators if that worked. She said she burned $20, still was trying to get it to print a flight boarding pass, and that the front desk said they weren't responsible.

P. S. the front desk queue design is horrid anyway. Lots of dead time with no one in front of queue going up until an agent comes over and yells NEXT! (And they have to, it's so noisy)

But a cool pool, nice room (cool curtain control!), card key success rate 100% on one card and 0% on other (one more wait in front desk line!!), room safe small but practical. Monorail access very easy.

Their version of the fascist ""Las Vegas resort fee"" was $20 in September 2013.

Checked in really late (3am) and it was definitely not a warm welcome. Started as an argument when the changed the rate from our original price and ended in frustration. Reg low end room $289, listed $169. (Even though we booked a room they sold out and put us in a pet room that was more expensive-nothing special at all) Oh well we needed to sleep. 

Room only had sheets (no blankets). Shower was leaking so the entire night we got the rainfall effect in the bathroom. 

Next day my soon to be fiancé didn't want to switch hotels so I decided to try to get a better deal than we had. They had to switch us out of the room and into another one across the way so we ended up waiting in line to re-check in for 45 min. Finally checked in to another room and we were in a hurry to get to an appointment. Got to the room and ha, they didn't clean the room. It had garbage on the floor and bedsheets pushed down. Floor was scratched like someone had been trying to rip up the boards. We called and explained our dilemma (now we can't wait for a room we had to go).  I then asked if they could have someone come clean the room and change the sheets\/towels. Here is where it gets good: I marked the pillowcases with makeup inside the pillows so I would know if they changed the sheets. 

Nope they put the old sheets from another guest back on our bed. Communication breakdown. Disgusting. When I went up to the desk to explain the matter and I stayed very calm to see what they would do. How about a free buffet he said.

First off let me say Why the heck is it so hard to find the parking!?! No sign saying Flamingo Parking or Park Here. Geezus! So after two U turns and a ""I think it's this way honey"" we turned in and were glad to find that we had made the right decision. After we drove through the most confusing self parking garage and actually ended up going the wrong way at one point, we ended up just parking and walking down a level to the elevators. These have to be some of the oldest elevators that exist in Las Vegas. And for me that is not a good thing. Due to this one moment in my life where I was stuck in an elevator - a story for another time. So once we get down and find our way to the casino we start searching for the garden chapel. Not many signs directing the way. If I wouldn't have been staring off into space out of the doors leading outside we would have missed it. We headed outside and looked rather out of place walking past the tourists in swimsuits. We continued on the beaten path and had to continue to follow signs around the outside area. We finally headed up to a little building that looked like it could possibly be the chapel.

We headed in and were greeted by our family members. My sister was in the brides quarters doing final touches. Not a bad sized room with plenty of mirrors. Total with the bride there were 7 of us and there was still a bit of room left over. We headed out to wait for the ceremony to begin. We were told by the minister NOT to take photos or video...ARE YOU SERIOUS! Yah I get they want you to buy the photos they take and the video they record, but honestly let me get a couple snaps in because I like raw photos. Anyway, the ceremony began and it was beautiful. I was bawling like a baby the whole time. Nothing over the top, but more simple and elegant. We were told to remain seated after the ceremony while they exited and signed papers and then they were to return and do complete photos with family. We all took turns getting our pictures taken with bride and groom and then we were to exit while they finished photos together. The brides stuff was taken out of the room and stored in the employee room as they had another bride scheduled immediately after. We actually saw the next bride walking up as we were exiting. As you exit the chapel and turn right down a couple steps there is a pretty waterfall. We decided to take our own photos in front of it while waiting. It did have a bit of a smell, maybe due to the birds and things. 

After the bride and groom exited we made them take photos in front of the waterfall and then we headed out to the reception. You can exit down the chapel steps and follow the pool around to the valet which you can also access the self parking garage. (wish I would have known that before walking in a big circle through the casino) The whole place seemed pretty dirty and smelly. Would not be my suggestion for a first time tourist. The elevator felt sketchy as we were going back up to level 6. It was shaky and stuttering and there was an actual hole cut in the ceiling that you could watch the elevator going up. Yah I may have had a slight panic attack and practically jumped off the elevator as it came to our stop.

I am not sure if I will frequent the Flamingo or even go back unless there was something enticing. As far as the room reviews I have read, I don't think I'd have a staycation either. It's a staple of Las Vegas, just needs some cleaning and a bit updating.",2,1,1

We were aware that this hotel was ""older"" but was hoping it was up kept. Our thoughts about the place is mixed with little pros and LOTS of cons.

Firstly, parking was absolutely a pain and was quite inconvenient. Cramped parking ramp and was a lengthy walk to get there. 

Our check in date was on a Sunday evening, the check in process and lines were not bad to our surprise. Our front desk person was very nice and accommodating. Our vacation package room that we booked was the Fab Deluxe (so the SUPER BASIC and non renovated rooms). The elevators in this place was super janky, unkept and old, it didn't feel safe. There were multiple times we got off the elevator just to avoid getting stuck. Rooms in parts of the flamingo hotel are remodeled or renovated and unfortunately ours was one of the much older rooms. YOU WILL SEE A HUGE DIFFERENCE AS YOU WALK THE HALLS. Even the non smoking floors were dingy and smelled like smoke. 

Our room was clean and extremely basic with a door connecting to another room. The bathroom looked like a run down motel. Vents had rust on them and tiles were cracked. No fridge. We wouldn't have been surprised if roaches were to crawl out of the vents. 

Also the rooms are VERY paper thin. When we were in the room or sleeping we could hear every single word the group next door was saying. It was so loud and clear it felt like we were sharing a room with them. Plus since it's only one door connecting the rooms you can see that they are in the room. It was super weird.  Since our neighbors were jackasses and the room was not even sound proofed we were determined to be placed in another room the next morning. It wasn't worth it losing sleep, ruining a vacation because of rowdy people. 

We were upgraded at the ""reduced"" rate of an additonal $15\/day to one of the GO Deluxe Rooms. Much better to our liking. It was very clean, but definitely you can tell that the hotel has been through alot. Loved the tv in the bathroom mirror! The mini fridge in the room was a free standing white fridge that didn't go with the room. 

Peaceful and quiet from there on out with sleeping.

The type of crowd that was at the Flamingo were mostly super young people and was not at all classy. 

The hotel was over crowded, aged and boring. 

Check out was a different story than checking in. The front desk agent was a middle aged man who didn't bother to greet or inquire on our stay. Was snooty regarding the billing questions I had and when I returned the keys he didn't care or say thank you. 

Conclusion:

Good location and that's about it. Price we paid was reasonable but would pay extra to go elsewhere.

Would I stay here again? NO.

My advice to the Flamingo:

*Get your elevators fixed
*Get more pleasant people at the front desk
*Renovate the entire hotel",25,5,0

Stayed here for a work trip for four nights.  When I got to the check in, I was told my GO room wasn't ready and put in the Habitat Tower.  Even though I had requested a non smoking room with one king bed, I was put in a room that smelled like smoke with two smaller bed.  The room had a view of the construction site next door along with the sounds of a jackhammer from midnight to 7 or 8 am.  After work on Tuesday, I went to the check in to be relocated into the room I was originally booked for (as instructed the day before).  However, I was told there were still no available GO rooms, and I would have to stay the remainder of my trip in the room I was in.

I was given a $30 food and beverage credit for my troubles...which unfortunately I could only use in the steakhouse and two ""bars"".

My boyfriend and I booked a standard room - not a ""GO"" room - since we'd probably just have stayed at a more upscale establishment to begin with if we wanted to spend a couple hundred more dollars on our hotel.  The room was clean and comfortable, we had a nice view of the pool and some snow-capped mountains in the distance, and the bathroom seemed as if it had been renovated since our last visit 3-and-a-half years ago.

The three best things about the Flamingo are absolutely the price, the location, and the customer service.  

If you're thinking of staying somewhere suuuuuuper cheap in the center of the strip like the Imperial Palace or ""Bill's Gamblin' Hall & Saloon,"" you should probably just drop the extra couple bucks and stay at the Flamingo - it's honestly not that much more expensive, and the place is a lot nicer overall (for example, I did not find any bugs in my room here... but take one look at the Imperial Palace reviews and you'll find that a number of people who have stayed there cannot say the same thing).

Location-wise, it doesn't get much better than this.  Are there nicer hotels right in the middle of the Strip?  Well, sure, of course.  But you will probably never get a price as low as the Flamingo if you were to stay at Caesar's, Paris, or the Bellagio.

And as far as the customer service goes, we have consistently been treated very warmly by all of the staff members we've encountered there - from front desk personnel to the housekeeping staff... even the security guards with whom we shared an elevator on one occasion.  If you walk past a housekeeper in the hallway, even if they're not YOUR housekeeper, they greet you with a smile and a warm ""hello.""

So why not 5 stars?  Well really, let's be honest - it's still NOT the Bellagio.  The amenities are lacking a bit (for instance, there's not much good food to be had in the hotel), the casino isn't a lot of fun to hang out in, and the entertainment options aren't amazing (sorry, Donny and Marie Osmond).  But for a hotel - and really, that's kind of what's important here - the Flamingo is more than adequate.  Next time I go to Las Vegas, I'll probably stay there yet again.",3,2,0

We had to move three times. The first time we moved after complaining there was another guest checking in our room before we fully moved out. No one from the Hotel checked on our complaint before sticking another guest with the problem.

The carpet was beyond dirty. It reaked and had stains and dirt all over. If you stepped into the tub after walking on the carpet you would leave black footprints. There is no excuse for such filth and no excuse for ignoring it and pawning these rooms off on the next guest.

The Hotel is old and smells like it. They are trying to improve by updating, but have a ways to go. With all the lovely hotels in Vegas, why would anyone want to stay here is beyond me. It was my first and last time. I've never been treated as badly. A kennel would have been cleaner.

It would be the humane thing to just cut the life support but morally feels weird doing such a thing. It is the last standing Vegas casino from decades past. However, the Flamingo is out of place and not well maintained because of it. The place is in dire need of reconstruction. The dealers are a sad bunch and the crowd that is typically here are like those you find downtown (no offense, just out of place). Sad to say but the Flamingo is just not fit for today's generation, let alone what Vegas is all about. The amenities and attractions here are at the back-end of ideas for having a good time. Sure, if you're looking for something sub-par and feasible, then the Flamingo may be for you. But then again, if you are going to Vegas, then coming to the Flamingo would be like going across the country and eating at a national fast food chain, it's just not ideal for such an adventure. At this point, I would highly suggest to management to revamp the entire aspect of the Flamingo. Pink is sexy, use it. They need to get in on the night club, day club and casino shows that many of its neighbors have already done. At the least, have some well renowned restaurants make a home in this place! Overall, the Flamingo should be treated like history, nice to reminiscence about but then admire how far we've advanced from it by looking at what has replaced it.

Arrival - 19 MAR 16
Departure - 25 MAR 16

Like most everyone else that read yelp reviews, I had a little concern about my upcoming stay, but it was mostly unfounded.  I lived in Vegas for 10 years and left in 2013, so maybe I had an idea of what to expect, but I was not disappointed.  I have stayed at the Bellagio, Palazzo, and the Venetian, and know what to expect for $200-$600\/night.  The Flamingo came out to less than $50\/night (You get what you pay for!). That disclaimer out of the way, I arrived in town about 1600h, but had an appointment at 1730h and didn't get free and back to the hotel until 2330h.  PROTIP - No Check-in lines around Midnight!

This brings  up the only legitimate gripe for my stay, which was parking.  The Flamingo has a smaller, 6 story parking garage.  The first 3 stories are for Valet (Which was full), the remaining 3 stories are shared with Hertz Rental Car, and the Flamingo Residences, which results in NO parking available.  To be fair, remember that this was March 19th, which means March Madness, Spring Break, AND it was Saturday.   Needless to say, it was a little crowded on the strip.  I had to park at Caesars and walk over to the Flamingo.  The Next 4 nights, I was able to find parking after driving around the garage for a bit. 

Back to Check-in, Jennifer at the Front Desk was professional and courteous, and gave me a Strip-view room on the that appeared to be mostly updated.  The beds were clean and rather comfortable, the laminate floor was clean and in good shape, and the bathroom was clean, A\/C worked well, but my shower leaked (Not enough to be heard outside the bathroom though).  
I broke one of the drinking glasses in the Bathroom and housekeeping was there in 15 minutes to clean up what I couldn't get picked up.  The housekeeping guys were quick and professional too.

I left the hotel every morning around 0800h and usually returned around 2100h and never had to wait on an elevator to get up to the Habitat tower, and I only had to share an elevator about 50% of the time. 

Looking past the parking situation, I would stay at the Flamingo again, especially at sub-$50\/night rates!

I have yet to even check in yet and am already amazed how painful this experience is. I have been to Las Vegas a number of times before and I have never had to park my own car.

All of LV has done such an exceptionable job at making their guests feel like royalty but the Flamingo definitely lacks it in the rooms! 

Upon walking into the room, immediately above us on the ceiling there was holes patched up with plaster. I guess they missed the paint on this room because there was no attempt what so ever to hide it. Although, had this been the only issue with the room I would have been able to live with it. Next, I decided to check out the restroom... boy was I highly disappointed. The restroom was the tiniest thing ever and the shower certain which as probably originally purchased white was now stained in places with yellow and grey colored gunk!  The corners of the molding near the sink were also eroding and the toilet seat still had dust from god knows when.

Moving over to the room, the furniture in this place looked like it took a nasty beating. All of the tables, chairs, and dressers were all scratched. The furniture in the rooms definitely need to be replaced at this point or sent to a location who can sand them and stain them to look new again. There should be no reason why old beat furniture should be still in rooms and presented to hotel guests!! Common Flamingo, get it together please! 

Our whole room had agreed that we were going to call the hotel concierge and ask if somehow they could move our room or upgrade us because the room we were originally given was unacceptable. Upon showing them images of the room we were staying at, the font desk assistant apologized on behalf of the hotel but she explained that there were no rooms left for her to switch us to. 

Long story short, we stayed in the room the entire weekend but made a vow to never stay here again. If you plan on staying here please don't have high expectations upon entering the rooms. The location is excellent and it's an easy walk over to Cesar's Palace for Omnia (if you're into the nightclub scene), or the Linq for Hash House A Go Go for breakfast but don't expect too much from the hotel.",3,2,0

This would have been fine if I was somewhere else but I was on vacation and this was a major inconvenience.  I honestly would have been more forgiving if I had been warned. When I called customer service, they were anything but helpful. I got no explanation about why they turned off the water and he acted as if it was no big deal that the water was turned off. Bottled water wasn't going to allow me to shower that night. It was also a struggle to take of my contacts, wash my makeup off, and brush my teeth. In addition, going to the bathroom was also an issue. 

Otherwise...our room on the 27th floor had a great view. The Fab room we got was really nice, big and clean. There was no ""do not disturb"" sign so we had to go ask for it ourselves.

The pool is one of my favoritos in all of Vegas -haha, get it favorites, favoritos, Vinnie.  It's landscaped.  There are trees you can sit under.  They let you swim in the pool with your beer.  The DJ isn't too bad either.  We managed to find two seats every day we were there.  So my only complaint about the room is the sliding glass bathroom door.  It creeps me out!  There is a trade-off, they do have a TV in the bathroom mirror.  I was standing in the shower glued to Daisy of Love while scrubbing myself.

We got a pretty good deal on the room by purchasing through www.LasVegas.com and buying www.LasVegas.com gift cards for a discounted price at Costco.

We booked 2 queen beds, but ended up with 1 king size bed. Called for a room change, but they were all full, so to compensate for their mistake, the front desk lady promised us a room change between the hours of 11-1 pm the next day, and they brought in a complimentary pull out bed for the first night, that was springy and very uncomfortable.

There was construction going on in the morning after our first night in Vegas. So I called the front desk to have a room change at an earlier time. Turns out the woman we spoke to the night before did NOT make note of the arrangement and there were no rooms available. The new lady offered us $30 of food and drink.. I obviously refused, especially because there was CONSTRUCTION going on next door. Spoke to the manager, and she agreed to the room change.

Tip: If you're a group of young girls, DON'T GET TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF! Don't be afraid to demand what you deserve! The flamingo is great because it's in the middle of the strip and close by to a lot of great hotels. Affordable for Vegas, so I'd definitely come again.

Arrival: We arrived at the Flamingo around 11:15pm to get an early start on our weekend. The parking structure is easy to miss as it is just after the Flamingo\/Las Vegas Boulevard intersection, so be sure to keep your eyes peeled and watch out for pedestrians. The structure is old, dirty, and run-down, which is understandable for a 60+ year old hotel. 

Check In\/Out: It's about a 5 minute walk from the structure to check in. We must have caught the late night Vegas flights that evening, so check in took about 20 minutes. Not too bad. The lady at the desk granted my request for 2 doubles and a small coupon book, which I was happy with.

Price: Picked up this room for $30 on a Thursday night (including taxes). This hotel (as with all Caesar's properties) do not charge a resort fee, so for a 1 night stay, the value couldn't be beat! Rooms can be had for less than $100\/night on most weekends - a steal if you plan to stay on the strip.

Location: Can't be beat. Smack in the middle of the all the action. Makes the entire strip walkable if you choose to do so.

Hotel: Don't expect anything grand because this is one of Vegas' older hotels. However, it did meet my requirements for a pleasant stay: clean and working.  The old school decor actually adds a bit of charm IMO. There wasn't a stench of smoke, but that's probably because it was late. One thing I especially liked: the ease of access to our rooms and the strip - Easy to find and less than a 3 minute walk to either from the check in desk! We checked out the flamingo habitat and gift shop the next day - both pleasant experiences! For Total Rewards members, a discount was offered at the shop (10% I believe).

Room: Like with the hotel, don't expect anything grand but it is more than serviceable. The FAB Deluxe room I stayed in was recently renovated and quite charming. LCD TV, comfortable beds, hot pink curtains, a nice carpet in the middle of the room, and laminate plastic flooring. The floor may sound cheap, but it's ideal if you're coming to Vegas to party because it's easy for housekeeping (or you) to keep clean- no dirty carpet or potential for an accident ruining your room! The bathroom is outdated and the toiletries are cheap, but the shower pressure, sink, and toilet worked fine so that's enough for me.

Gambling: Did not gamble at this casino.

Food: Did not eat here, so no review. The buffet is a choice under the Buffet of Buffets deal.

Amenities: Did not use the gym, spa, wi-fi, etc. Since there are no resort fees at this hotel, all would be an extra charge if you wanted to use them.

Check out: Fast and easy via TV. Late check out was granted to me so that was cool.

Overall:  I would absolutely stay at this hotel again. If you're like me (on a budget and planning to do stuff outside of the hotel) then it is among the best with other comparable priced hotels. The location and value of this hotel were the biggest draws for me. If you're coming to Vegas to go out (party, club, sightsee, walk the strip, etc) and are simply looking for a clean and comfortable place to stay, then the Flamingo is a great choice. If you're planning to be wow'ed or stay in, I would look elsewhere. 

Overall, a great bargain and a pleasant stay. 4\/5.",3,0,0

I booked and received a room that was horrific.  Terribly dated, old furniture and bathroom not for the meek.

The wedding coordinator and her staff were fantastic. The price was far far less then it would be to have a big wedding at home. The waterfalls were pretty loud at our location, so if you are from out of town and don't have the luxury of visiting the campus before hand keep that in mind. 
The Locations of this hotel is ideal for Vegas and the GO Rooms are updated and really nice if you don't have the money to spent at Cesar's.Room service and guest services is non existent, each time I called I waited for at least 5 min and no one ever picked up. I tried it twice a day for the 3 days I was there to no avail. It would have been nice to have some champagne with everyone while we got ready for the wedding in our rooms... I would have happily paid for it and tipped whom ever brought it had anybody from room service or guest services done their job. 
The 21 and over pool is nice and is free to enter but it's also open to the public so its very crowded. We got there 30 min before it opened one morning waited in line for 45 min and by the time we got in all the lounge chairs around the pool were already gone. I was very disappointed that the blackjack and craps tables by the pool were only open 1 of the days we were there, to make thinks worse a singe mixed drink by the pool was $17 and that's not including a souvenir glass. The security staff at the pool were very rude and wouldn't even answer questions about the pool rules.
All in all the campus facilities are great but most of the hotel staff seem to hate their job and it shows, with exception of our wedding coordinator and her staff.",0,0,0

I didn't really have a good experience with this hotel (after not traveling to Las Vegas for almost 8 years) and coming back to see a hotel that didn't meet my expectations was terrible. 

This is primarily because of 3 things, customer service issue, key for the hotel room, and unwashed bed sheets and covers. What can I say about the customer service issue? One of the ladies who was in charge of hotel admission did not help at all with a simple room key problem. I rented the hotel room with a couple of friends and my name was not registered within the hotel room. The lady told me she couldn't do anything about fixing the hotel room key because my name was not listed for the room and she said ""I'm sorry."" I wasn't with my friends at this time because they were out having some fun in the casinos. Basically I was stuck in my hotel and I wasn't planning to wait hours for them to come back. I went back to the floor where my room was and then back downstairs again at the hotel admission but this time a different lady helped me out and she was able to let me get back in my room. 

The key for the hotel room was a disaster and such a hassle. The keys that were given to my friends and I kept malfunctioning and we'd have to go back upstairs and downstairs constantly in order to fix it. 

Lastly, the bed sheet covers and the pillow covers were not washed. They smelled really bad like someone's sweat was on the covers.",0,0,0

Part of the faucet was rotted off, mold all over the edge of the tiles, etc. One disappointing thing was that we had a strip view, but the windows look like they've never been cleaned so the view was fogged by dirt. Our TV remote, phone and clock didn't work. The cleaning staff was subpar at best. When we got there there was some plastic thing on the floor in the middle of the room. I left it to see if they ever cleaned it, nope. Stayed in the same place for an entire week. We were always missing something in the bathroom until the last day. It was either face cloths, towels, hand towels, etc.. The main issue was the noise. This place was like a frat house.

We had it at the lowest possible setting our whole stay and it never got below 80 in the room and stayed extremely humid the entire time! Not really what you are expecting to come back to after walking the strip. The pool isn't bad but what they do not tell you is to get into 21+ pool you have to be there by 11am.

After complaining to the front desk, they argued that even if I switched rooms, I was only going to get the exact same room. Having stayed there numerous times before, I knew that although I was only in a Fab room, I knew they had nicer, renovated ones that didn't make me feel as if I was in a run down motel.
Long story short, the manager gave me a new room that he was sure would be better (only after he too tried to convince me that I was expecting an upgraded room instead of the cheap one I had booked). The only difference were the bed frames were now black instead of chipped wood and the mirror had a frame.

First off, the parking is a nightmare. In Vegas, we all want to be treated like royalty. I enjoy valet and always valet in Vegas. We pull up to valet on a Friday and the valet is full....okaaayyyy. I have a whole car loaded down with suitcases and such, can I pull up to the curb for a bellboy? Sure! Just got wait in the that huge mile long line and we will get to you when we can. Really?! So we get in the huge line (think Orange County on a Friday evening), and after 15 minutes without moving, we get tired of waiting and decide to park the car and haul all our crap with us. 
Then we finally get inside, so I prop my husband up like a hobo to watch our bags while I check in. The line is LONG! I mean, like Disneyland long! Like, DMV long. Like  WT* long!! So I wait and wait and wait...meanwhile the man of Asian descent standing  in front of me is farting non stop. It smelled like old sushi, not that it's flamingos fault. But, when you stand there smelling rotten tuna, you start pointing fingers. So I finally get up front! Yay! After a minute of clicking on the computer, she picks up the phone and starts chatting with someone. I think JACKPOT, I might get an upgrade! Oh no, she called her friend and sat there giggling and complaining about her long shift. No wonder the line isn't moving. Meanwhile, the people checking in next to me were using their time to flirt and talk about their lives...cool bro. So anyways, no upgrade, just a nice long opportunity to listen to her on the phone. I had used a promo code when I booked my room, and I asked her about it. She said ""oh, I don't know about those"". Then, I asked her to break a $100, and she didn't have change. What?!!!!!!!! 
Whew! Let's drop our bags, and party...I need a drink after that checkin! In the elevator we go!!! Oh! What's going on? The elevator just hopped, no..FELL like one or two floors, made a crazy noise and then started again. Everyone on the elevator was screaming and one girl was crying!! Yes crying! So we get out of the death trap and find out room. 
**meanwhile, the girl crying said she was going to management immediately. The entire time we stayed (4 days), that elevator remained open and we heard more people talk about the crazy stuff it was doing. I avoided it like the plague. More complaints, still stayed open. 
Our room was fine. It looked like a porno set, but it was clean and functional. Whatever. 

I am giving two stars bc, I'm a giver. But here are some more complaints:
-the front side, facing the strip, smells like urine..everywhere. But it could be all the homeless. But, with all the money flamingo rakes in, couldn't they clean the urine off? 
-no customer service, like at all. Freaking no VIP treatment anywhere!!! I'll be taking my business to MGM or Mandalay Bay. 

Perks: we had a great time at the pool. I made my hubby stand in line at about 7:45 and we got a great spot when the pool opened at 9 am (Saturday). Sunday and Monday we got in fast, no wait.

All in all, never will I give my business to Flamingo. It was so unprofessional and such a disappointment. In fact, I may be disputing charges, bc my card was charged way too much, just to add the cherry on top.",1,0,0

We reserved a GO view room and lost our reservation despite the fact that I called the day before to confirm and I called again while we were en route, explaining that we will be arriving at 1am. He said he made a note that I called and he documented our new ETA. Here's what we ended up with on arrival:

A king size, not the 2 queens that was requested 
No view
Furniture with lots of tears in the leather
Holes and stains in the bedding
Hard bed and either hard pillows or really worn out pillows that need to be thrown away.
Water damage to the ceilings 
A rollaway, which the attendant said she had requested since we had 2 kids with us (the rollaway took 2 hours to arrive)
The rollaway was sunk in the middle. My poor kids looked like they were folding in half.

The attendant told us the rooms were not guaranteed and said we could switch rooms the next day, but we were so busy that it would have been an inconvenience. She also said our room was originally on hold but the manager had to give it away (and give us a downgraded room instead). We paid over $500 for the original room we requested for the 2 nights and the only way they could comp us was to take off the $30 resort fee and provide us with that sorry rollaway. Housekeeping even opened our door after the first night even though the do not disturb sign was up. They thought we we due to check out!

Unfortunately we did not have a good experience and ended up checking out at 6am bc we were highly disappointed. We were in room 23008 which was not worth the money at all! I really wanted to like this hotel too so I'll end on some good notes...

Without giving away the entirety of this movie older than some of you reading this, you have a story set in Vegas about...wait for it...casinos. A mobster casino tycoon essentially starts to become a dinosaur and starts to lose his, uh, ""purpose"". 

The Flamingo Hotel and Casino is a dinosaur that's lost its purpose. 

Check in time is 4...however you can check in early for a minor fee of $30 at 12pm and $25 at 2pm. You will find yourself in a monster line that moves moderately but is still daunting and the last thing you want to see after traveling whether coming from near or far. Self check-in kiosks are great...unless you are coming for a conference and don't have access to the company credit card. 

When I check in, I am talking to a friendly employee and he is telling me about where the pool is, how to connect to the wi-fi and, out of the blue, says, ""Snoop Dogg will be here on Tuesday with Dr. Dre!"" This was after I'd told him that I was staying there for a computer information systems conference. 

""Oh, ok."" 

They have a ""free"" baggage check that brings your bags to your room after you check in so you don't have to carry your stuff around with you (normal for a hotel) and after my work colleague described the awkwardness of having to tip before her bags were relinquished, I headed to my room...and thought I was going to turn on a light...and discovered I had to walk to the lamps and there were no overhead room lights to speak of. 
Even with all three lamps turned on, the mood lighting that pervaded the room was fit more for a honeymooning couple than an individual who had to get some work done. 

*side note...WHY on earth are hotels still charging for wi-fi? They have a daily $34 resort fee that includes wi-fi and use of the gym, 14.99 for some a la carte daily wi-fi. WHY ARE YOU CHARGING FOR WI-FI? Also, the phone coverage is horrible regardless of what carrier you have and I don't know if that is by design or what.

I go to the bathroom and immediately notice the rust. Rust everywhere. Rust on the shelf above the toilet, rust on the emergency fire sprinkler, rust on the showerhead. Also, when I came out I saw what looked like old grease spots in kitchen ON THE CEILING. How? The door paint was chipped; the shower tile stained. 

Then, the water. I turn on the water faucet to wash my hands and the smell of chlorine smacked me in the nose. Smacked and lingered. Smacked and lingered every time I turned the faucet on throughout my 5-day stay. Meanwhile, when I got in the shower later, the water pressure was on the Civil Rights firehose setting and I had to spend the majority of the shower time getting my lather on in a small corner of the bath hoping to overcome. 

The walls are paper thin. I was in a room that had the connecting door that I didn't know still existed. Like, look, even if I travel with a bunch of people I know, there is a reason that we have separate hotel rooms. If I need to talk to them, that's what my $14.99 wi-fi is for. I could hear the people next door so closely that whenever they opened their door, I thought it was housekeeping coming into my room despite the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign in the key slot. 

Folks all of this was the first night and continued throughout the stay. 

I go downstairs the next morning for the conference and it began a week-long journey of runny eggs, random breads, fruit, and maybe bacon, maybe sausage, maybe nothing for breakfast. But breakfast wasn't the problem: it was lunch. 

We break for lunch and head to a gigantic conference room and are greeted with carrot cake, saucy chicken breast and rice with some...maybe zucchini? Green peppers? I don't know. 

I am not expecting top notch fare as it's hotel conference food. This was not catered from Center Cut Steakhouse downstairs. It was edible and got the job done but I got concerned as I got closer to the bone and it was incredibly read inside the chicken. My colleague has some pinkish chicken so she stopped midway through; I did not eat the red bone pieces...

...should have had none of it. Without going into detail, I enjoyed a rustic view for the remainder of the night. The next night, the work colleague I came with suffered the same fate and only had half the Tuesday chicken. We did not have lunch there the rest of the week...we opted for the overpriced fare in the food court from Johnny Rockets or Pan Asia.

The best part about this place, however, is the staff. Every interaction I had with a staff member was pleasant. They were genuinely friendly and willing to help where they could. Last thing...they have pictures of nostalgia of the old Flamingo everywhere. They should not. We don't have any pictures of the dinosaurs and have gotten along just fine.",9,4,1

I've stayed at a few places in Vegas as I'm there quite often for business trips. On a last minute decision, I ended up having to go to Vegas again and Flamingo was the cheapest for buying just a few days before. 

When we got there, check in was pleasant and easy. And, my positive experience ends there. Our room was so dirty. A layer of dust was over all the furniture and there were crumbs on the sofa and countertops. 

The next day, when we got back into our room, it was actually EVEN dirtier. The maid had worn dirty shoes in the bathroom and there were black footmarks all over the floor. When I asked the receptionist to have them clean it up- no surprise- nothing happened. 

To top everything off, the Valet is also really inefficient and it takes forever for them to get you your car. Once, they lost our ticket and we ended up waiting over 30 minutes!!

The Flamingo may be the best value in Vegas for those on a budget, but able to spend more than you might at Circus or Trop. Understand that I'm NOT comparing this hotel to the Venetian, Bellagio or even MGM .  I'm comparing it to other mid-range casino resorts on the strip (Bally's , to some extent Aladdin, TI, Monte Carlo, Luxor). Flamingo's location cannot be beat.  If you get a room facing the strip, you'll enjoy floor to celling windows and a view of Ceasars in all it's glory.  Rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable.  Not particularly cheap materials (bedding, countertops) either.   The pool looks pretty incredible, though we were there in November, and the grounds are a nice departure from the urban feel of the strip.  By far the greatest feature of the rooms at Flamingo is the cheap (yes, CHEAP) roomservice.  Flamingo doesn't charge a service charge (usually about 20%) nor does it require a 25% gratuity.  Also, items are fairly priced, considering they're delivered to your room at any hour of the day.  I must have ordered the buffalo chicken wings (not kidding about 12 good sized, spicey wings in an order) for $7.95 (total cost $10 with tip) all three nights that we were in town. 

Casino isn't much to rave about- sort of small, slot heavy. Very little poker action.  No real stand out bars.  But since you're in the middle of the strip, you can walk (or stagger) a few paces in any direction and find yourself at a suitible gambling spot.",2,1,0

As regulars in Vegas, my husband and I are used of the level of service at other casinos.  We typically stay at Mirage, Bellagio, or (if my husband is with the guys), Harrah's.  We have always been taken care of, and if anything were to go awry, the casino would do what it could to make us happy.

Fastforward to Flamingo.  Booked 2 weeks in advance for a girls trip.  Reserved one of the upgrade rooms.  After a long flight, we were greeted by a SURLY young woman at the front desk and were promptly told that our room was NOT AVAILABLE.  If we wanted a comparable room, we would have to pay an additional $129\/night or we could have a roll-out cot in a lesser room.  I was SHOCKED.  Had her speak to a supervisor who was too busy to come out of the back office to talk to us.

 I asked her if this is typical at Flamingo and what they are willing to do to keep us at their casino?  
She said (and I quote): ""Nothing, you are welcome to stay somewhere else"".     (?????!?!!!!!!!!!?!!!!!!!!!!!)  

Now, let me just say that the only time this has happened before (room unavailable), Mirage upgraded us at no charge and were extremely apologetic.  Flamingo indicated that there is a fine print on the website, and the deposit doesn't RESERVE the room you want it is only a SUGGESTION for when you arrive to check in.  

Needless to say, we promptly took our business elsewhere and didn't step foot into Flamingo to gamble or to even buy a drink.  

The $73 deposit was charged to our visa and was NEVER refunded because while I was there I did not get IN WRITING that we cancelled our reservation.

The bathroom even had a television!  5 stars for the room!

The casino itself was fine.  Not as nice as other hotels on the Strip, but still okay.  The ambiance just seemed dated and needed some renovations.  Please note though, that we stayed here a couple of years ago.  So maybe now, renovations of the casino have taken place.  I do not know.

The pools and gardens are terrific!!  It gets crowded at times at the pools though.  Make sure to check them all out!

We chose this place based on the pool for kids... In the slide are (Adult pool is separate and gated to over 21) the slide area where there are mostly families has no chairs or benches what so ever. So expect to stand if not in the pool with your kids. That's right not one chair. The managers reasoning was its dangerous...SERIOUSLY! My 80 yr old grand parents had to stand around in the heat or go sit at another pool. So who watches the kids then??? The life guards who were doing more flirting than watching swimmers. I have a 3 minute video showing 3 of them flirting and chatting turned away from the pool ... Great job lifeguards! 
SERVERS ... It is quite obvious by the hour wait at the middle pool that they need to hire more than 1. No where to be seen, not shocked, so u need to serve yourself. YES that resort fee $32 obviously is worth paying. 
TABLE SERVERS....again 1 on the floor as I gambled for 2 1\/2 hours and was able to get 2 drinks. This is the long weekend so you think they would be prepared and have better service. 
ROOMS.. There are no information guides\/books to the  hotel that you usually get in a hotel, nothing it's a decent bare room. If you are a first timer to Vegas their is no Hotel guide to tell u anything
YOU will have workers offer you free this and that, sounds great until they ask how many in your party, when I say 6 they change subject and walk away... Pathetic and rude.

I would also like to say that I will not be staying here again.

On day two of our stay we had no hot water. Guest services told me I was the only one that complained.  Upon check out guest services said that they can't compensate for our day with no hot water because it affected the entire hotel.  Cold showers is not a great way to start the day.  :(

Our initial room was quite dilapidated so we upgraded.  When we got to the new room we realized that we had one soft pillow and three bricks. When I called guest services they told me they could not bring me an additional soft pillow nor could they exchange one of the bricks for a soft one. They brought us three more bricks. I've never had a hotel deny me a pillow. :(

Someone had turned the refrigerator to the lowest setting and all of the ice had melted causing it to flood. I had to clean that up before I could use it.  It also took forever to get cold again.  House keeping should probably check that after every guest.

So at a reasonable hour at night I wanted to order up some room service only to discover that room service cuts off at 9 PM.  I would expect a Vegas hotel to serve later than that. Sunday through Thursday hours are from 6 AM to 1 PM. :(

We realized when we ordered breakfast that it's not really room service. It's delivery from their café to go downstairs. Everything came in a bag.  I really could've used a real fork and a plate.  :(


Housekeeping doesn't vacuum. 

At 6 AM on our final day I called guest services to request a slightly later check out. I was hoping to go from 11 AM to 12 PM. Apparently they charge for that.  My first time in Vegas not being accommodated with a late check out without having to pay for it.

When checking out I realized that I had charges on my bill for Internet. It's supposed to come free with the $34 per day resort fee.  When I called guest services the agent argued with me about removing the charges because I had more than two devices connected at any one time.  :(

Pros:
- Location is excellent! They're currently building the new Linq restaurant\/entertainment district right next door so it'll be even better once that opens.
- Casino is remodeled and clean, they are also remodeling their food court as well.
- Pools are AWESOME. The Go Pool plays great music, lots of people having a good time, multiple bars around the pool, and amazing waterfall. The family pool has a water slide! I'm a big kid at heart so of course I went on that bad boy a few times.
- Our room was one of the remodeled ones, so it was clean and fresh. We had the type of room with the laminate floors, which I actually prefer because carpet grosses me out.
- Wildlife habitat was pretty cool! I love flamingos and they also had toucan parrots that you could take photos with.

Cons:
- While most of the hotel is remodeled, they really need to update their hallways. When walking to our room, the carpets were all nasty and pulled up in some areas. Looked like gross stains on the sides and it just felt like walking through a totally different hotel.
- Service was kind of crappy. When we checked in, we had to wait in a super long line. Then when we get to the front desk, we were told we could only get a room with double beds. When we go up to the room, it's still being cleaned by housekeeping, so we had to go back downstairs (with all of our stuff!) and grab a drink to kill time. Annoying!

So I had to go to Vegas for work. Our convention was at Caesars. Obviously a great place, but after research, the Flamingo across the street was about $600 cheaper for 4 nights - worth it in my book! A+ for pricing!

I dont gamble much (and was working), so cant comment o much on the casino part - but the fact at night, a lot of their dealers are dressed from their burlesque show in very sexy and provocative outfits - A+!

The pool - very nice. a little loud on the (seemingly) constant Ke$ha playlist, but reasonably priced drinks, great scenery and a relaxing atmosphere 

The guest rooms - I liked them! a white\/pink\/steel motif. Very modern. Opaque glass sliding doors to the bathroom. a huge shower with jets that come out of the wall. Speakers in teh celing so you can lsiten to music or TV while you are getting ready... 

and speaking of TV, in addition tot he 42"" plasma in the main room, there was one built into the mirror in the bathroom. kinda cool. Got to watch the US open while shaving!

And the beds were SUPER comfortable

So you are probably wondering, with all these great things, why only 3 stars?

Well, my room was not visited by housekeeping till the third day I was there (and only after I asked). A little disappointing

Also , I requested a king bed and got two doubles (which proved to be ok, since my bed was never made up by housekeeping!)
can I make my own bed? Yes, do I need fresh towels? no. But this is part of being at a hotel, getting pampered a bit

I guess it goes intot he 'get what you pay for"" colum as well

wasnt quite as nice as othe rplaces, but a lot less expensive

if you have a budget trip to Vegas, definitely check them out. !",3,1,1

I personally loved the breakfast the next morning, the biscuits and gravy were to die for. They also have a quaint little garden\/ wildlife exhibit, of course with flamingos. The pool wasn't open when I went and besides that was under rennovation. We did get one of the updated rooms, laminate floors, nice view, pink tinted windows and accents, and a good sized bathroom.

Probably rather distracting if your actually trying to play seriously, but nice to look at as you walk by. 

The above reasons are really the only reasons I can honestly give it even 2 stars though. 

I just took my girlfriend there for our 2 year aniversury  and boy do I ever regret it. It wasn't the ants in my bathroom that got into all of our stuff. These things happen at the best of hotels and I'll let it slide. No, what blew my mind was the reaction by the hotel staff, and the fiasco that followed. The initial reaction by Guest Services, and i use the term loosely, was one of total un-suprise. (I later found out at least 3 other people all had the same problem.) I was not apologized to, and they actually asked if i wanted a different room. I was then put on hold for about 5 minutes before being told that I could come down to the desk to get a new key. 

And here's where things REALLY went down hill. I got the new key, dragged my girlfriend and all our luggage half way across the hotel, and walked into our new room, to find it hadn't been cleaned. When my girlfriend called to complain, she was actually hung up on. To say i wasn't amused would be an understatement.

We finally got a third room, and the front desk manager assured me that the room had been inspected and was ready for us. So we dragged our stuff half way across the hotel again only to find, you guessed it, another dirty room. 

We were finally upgraded to a full suit, and grudgingly comped dinner for our troubles. And it was a good thing we were comped dinner, as by that time it was almost midnight and we had started this whole process at 9:30. 

The end result of them ruining our anniversary? A comped dinner, and one of the two night stay comped. For ruining our whole weekend we got a grand total of 200$ worth of comps. For getting hung up on, run all over, made to wait more then 30 minutes for each room change, and dragging our luggage on the death march to hell, we got $200 dollars.

The best part? The woman next to me at check out Sunday morning was being comped for the exact same thing, and as we walked away, she said that the woman next to her had the same problems, with fewer room changes, but still. 

Needless to say, I will not be visiting that casino again, ever.",0,0,0

The rooms can be had for a decent price usually especially weekdays. The rooms have also been renovated. Flamingo is located center Strip and is close to everything. It's attached to the Linq and therefore easy to get to all the dining, shopping, and entertainment. My favorite part about the Flamingo is the tranquil gardens and walking paths that wind around.

First we had difficulty locating the parking entrance in the mist of 5 o'clock traffic. There were no courtesy signs navigating flamingo-goers. But at last we found it, parked and trekked to the lobby in the 109 degree dessert heat. 

We check in with ease utilizing the self check in machine. When we get to our floor it reeked of filth. The carpet in the hallways was so incredibly dirty, probably years since they cleaned it last, most of it raised from moisture damage. This was the first major red flag. But we continued the journey to our room none the less. As soon as we walked in I noticed the place had neither been vacuumed, swept, wiped or much of anything. 

The corner lamp looked as though it had been knocked over and trampled on before being placed on the dresser again. Dust and smudge marks on the TV. A significant amount of dirt, hair, and other debris on the floor and carpet. Then I sit on the bed and notice a film of gunk on the night stand that resembled human fluids. And then my husband told me there were cum stains on the curtains - yes folks, cum stains! It was about now when I said this is simply unacceptable when paying over $100 per night, I've seen far better rooms at a motel 6. 

So I call customer service to report the status of the room, not only was the attendant rude but also uncaring. She said she would call maid service up. I asked for a partial refund for the inconvenience and to this she replied the casino would comp my hubby and I with a $30 casino credit. I asked when the maid would be up she replied ""I don't know"". This is when it became a customer service issue along with the cleanliness issue. 

I asked to speak to the manager, only to be treated in the exact same way. She then forwarded me to the maid manager claiming perhaps she could better assist me with my problem. The maid manager said she didn't know what time the maids could come to the room that management should have offered me another room. So then I call the front desk again, demanded to speak to the manager because after an hour of being placed on hold and getting no where I was ready to flip. As I'm trying to get a hold of Sandra (hotel manager of the century) the customer service attendant states that I could not be issued a new room since it was after five (we checked in around 5:30pm) and that I the manager had already offered to change my room which I declined (bold face lie left in the notes). When I finally got in touch with the manager she neither denied nor confirmed any of the information passed and insisted her hands were tied and there was NOTHING she could do. 

After another 30 minutes of banter and BS we were able to check out and receive a full refund for our 2 hour stay in hell. 

We ended up staying at Rumor Boutique, which is off the strip, which was incredibly nice, clean, and had the friendliest staff!

IN SUMMARY:  the flamingo offered us filthy rooms with filth and dirt all over - to include human matter (lube and idk what else on the night stand and cum on the curtains) and terrible customer service.

I have never spoken to a hotel manager that did not give a crap in the world to make your stay remotely comfortable - way to go Sandra!",1,0,0

The room itself was remodeled..which meant they threw down cheap laminate floors and used white sheets over a nasty old hotel blanket as a quilt and a faux fur pink thing at the foot of the bed.  Our feet were filthy after walking in our room for a few minutes which means they don't get cleaned.  The bedsheets had holes and the pink faux fur was nasty dirty.

It had not been remodeled...ok no biggie...but there's no excuse for mold in the shower, pealing paint on the door, rust on the sconces and dust caked on the vent.

The good: The Flamingo is one of the few reasonably priced hotels on the strip and that counts for a lot when the casinos are going to be taking your money anyway. The rooms are actually fairly nice as they were recently remodeled. They're a bit pink I admit to stick with the Flamingo theme, but the bathrooms are especially good. There's a tv in the bathroom and the showers have jets coming out of the wall. Top notch stuff. They offer digital check in, you can swipe your credit card at a kiosk and avoid dealing with lines or receptionists.

The bad: It's clearly not as nice as some of the surrounding hotels. The casino is pretty bad, it's old, smells awful, has nowhere near enough blackjack, and is actually fairly small. And it's attached to Margaritaville which is crazy expensive and full of terrible slots. The line to check in is the slowest moving line in vegas.

We'll start with the hotel room itself. Yuck. Old and outdated. Nothing fancy about them at all. For some reason two of our outlet covers were unscrewed to the wall and sitting on the floor. Why doesn't housekeeping take care of this? The only time we had fresh towels was the first day we walked into our room. For the four days after that, we only had the dirty one we used from the first day. One of the elevators was constantly breaking down. It took us to a wrong floor and the next day we saw maintenance staff attempting to get people out of it when it was stuck. Glad I wasn't them!
The casino is small and boring. The drink service really wasn't bad though compared to some other places. They had various costs of slots which is nice for the big gambler and the little gambler. Donny and Marie play here. Get a new act! They're too old and outdated for the younger crowd. There are a few food options but not very many at all.

We stayed in a Fab Luxury Room and even though there were no pink curtain (I was kind of excited about that), the room was very nice, except for the super tiny bathroom. I'm not sure what the floor were made out of, but I was happy it was carpet, and the new floor made moving furniture really easy. So the bathroom...tiny and not updated. If you plan on staying here with your girlfriends, don't expect to all get ready in the bathroom, its nearly impossible to fit 2 people in there, but hey, its Vegas and you shouldn't be in your room that much anyway. There was no mini fridge and NO COFFEE MAKER! Also, if you like to get ready to music, you need to bring your own iPod dock. They have a crappy alarm clock\/stereo that allows you to plug into your headphone jack on your iPod\/iPhone\/iTouch, but the sound quality is horrendous that you are better off using your speakers on your iWhatever.

The pools are awesome and get crowded really early. If you can sneak drinks in, do it, otherwise expect to pay $15 for drinks or hit up their bucket special of Miller Lite for $5 for $25. They do have a DJ and dancers for entertainment.

In town for a wedding, and we chose the Flamingo due to it's proximity to Caesar's Palace. What a mistake. One that I will never make again. Rooms were decent, but $250\/night should buy a bit more. The $35 per night resort fee is a joke, and it doesn't even allow you access to the WiFi. 

Cold. Showers. We didn't have hot water throughout the entire weekend. They didn't seem to care. Guest relations told me to let the hot water run in the sink and it will run hot in the shower. WHAT? That didn't work. Hotel reps claimed to be bewildered and then would say there was an 'emergency maintenance issue' that 'was resolved', but that was a lie. It was never resolved. After seven total calls on both days, they waived my exorbitant resort fees. Gee, thanks...

A recommendation to management: BOILER ROOM CONTINGENCY PLAN.

Now for the worst part...I can deal with cold showers at $250\/night. I can handle the ridiculously high food and beverage prices. What I DIDN'T expect was to be BOMBARDED by TimeShare salespeople.

Bombarded.

Right at check-in, there were two people there from 'Wyndham Resorts' offering me free this and free that to sign up for a timeshare seminar. On your way to the elevator: TIMESHARE. Walking around the casino: TIMESHARE. Hey, that looks like an employee and I need assistance: Nope! TIMESHARE. No corner turned without a Wyndham representative.

Are you kidding me? 

Why would you subject your high-paying customers to that? As they say in baseball: Bush League.

We came back at 3 pm, they said come back at 4 pm cus the room wasn't ready. That's okay cus technically check-in time is 4 pm. Came back at 4 pm and was told the room wouldn't be ready for 30-45 minutes....we asked for a manager. Our room was ready in 10 minutes, and he gave us a $30 coupon to use at the bar or gift shop. So that's decently fair.
   
  Anyway Flamingo's location is quite possibly the best on the strip. Right smack dab in the middle, what more could you ask for? The distance from room to elevator to the strip was real short unlike so many other casinos where it's an absolute chore to get from your room to the strip or vice versa. And I like how when you walk out of the casino..you're right on the sidewalk...there's no long ass escalator\/path you have to take to get to the sidewalk. I mean wow. 

  We also liked the rooms considering we got the upgrade Go! Rooms that are newly remodeled, and look nothing like the outside of the casino (which is starting to show it's age pretty badly). The beds were big, clean, and comfy. Huge ass 42"" LCD TV, a TV in the bathroom mirror, a separate shower and tub. The shower also had some body jets which was nice. No problems with the water temp. or pressure. I'm used to staying in standard rooms or Vegas or even sh*t holes like Tropicana...this was anything but that.

Service: I didn't like how they couldn't guarantee my dry cleaning would get to me in the 6-8 pm slot that it said on the bag, but it did arrive on time. The cleaning ladies did a decent job, and didn't steal anything so that's also good. And when we called for our bags, extra glasses, and hangers..they were quickly brought up (very quickly)..that's good.

Casino: The theme is losing it's touch, but it's still decently nice inside. It's not Bellagio, it's not O'Sheas either. Drinks take a little while to get to you, but I think I was up a couple hundred in this casino, and my buddy won $2,000 w\/the lucky lady jackpot on the blackjack table...plus they had $5 and $10 tables during busy times..that works for me. 

Pool: Really nice, I came a little late so no staff or bar was to be found...but I'm sure in the hotter days it'd be excellent.

View: my two rooms had amazing views. One had a good view of the pool, and the other had amazing view of the Bellagio fountains. 

Price: I originally booked the Go! rooms directly through Flamingo for $590 each plus tax for Friday & sat night. Then I cancelled and rebooked them for $610...why you may ask.  Because I found a cheaper rate of $540 on Orbitz. Due to their Best Rate Guarantee..they not only matched the cheaper rate, but they dropped it 25%. Our rooms now were a little under $400 for the weekend per room. Sounds like a great deal to me.

Overall: Other a few slight quirks here and there. I can't give Flamingo any less than 5 stars. I'm sure it'd be different if we paid more and\/or were stuck with a standard room. But considering of our group we paid $100 each for the room here, compared to the $70 each at Tropicana or $90 each for Bally's. I definitely will say Flamingo was well-worth the little extra money for the room quality and strip location. I'd highly recommend Flamingo's Go! Rooms to anyone who wants a great value on the strip.

We were staying on the 28th floor.  It was raining and there where some leaks in the hall.  All of the sudden the alarm goes off- we wait for a while- it is still going off.  We head into the hall to see if anyone can tell is what is going on.  We see a panicked woman visiting the US for Austrailia.  She is scared and so we headed down the fire escape.  About the 14th floor we couldn't hear the sirens so we exited the stairwell and we could still hear the alarm.  We didn't know if the elevators were safe.  The fire exit path was not marked as you headed out to the roof over the casino so we had to try several doors at each turn.  We finally get into the hotel and no one knows what we are talking about.  We are told to go to the front desk. 

At the front desk we hailed a manager.  Our Australian women was still shaking so I went and got her a chair from the Casino.  It was right at shift change so the first manager told us it was a false alarm and we would be moved.   She passed us off to Mildred.  She was nice.  We were downgraded rooms in the move so we asked for a manager.  

Ryan Ramsey came up.  He offered to comp our night for tonight.  When we asked about the fire escape not being marked he just said ""what do you want me to do?""  When we asked if it was the same kind of room and he said since we didn't pay for the upgrade we weren't entitled to any else.  We said we were very scared and upset he smirked and told us ""I don't know what you want me to do...""  

We asked why no one- even the front desk manager knew about the alarm as they could be checking people into unsafe rooms.  He said they had already stopped checking people into those rooms because of the leaks.   We asked why we had t been called with an offer to move- he said ""we just don't do that""

We asked to speak to his manager.  He said there was no one we could talk to.  That there was no one there higher up than him.  If we wanted to complain we had to email the vp of operations.  We questioned that there was no management level between him and her and he said no.  

At this point now were are furious- he says something like ""I comped you for tonight I don't know what you want me to do"". He was INCREDIBLY condescending.  He also told us how frustrated he was because he just got here and he got this problem thrown at us.  We tried to ask him if he was frustrated how did he think we felt.  He didn't care.  

We went upstairs and the bellman was not there because we hadn't gotten back from the front desk.  Honestly at this point we were a little scared and just wanted out of the room.  We called another bellman and shoved everything into bags as fast as we could.  We warned a few guests that the alarm had gone off and there where leaks in our rooms.

I got a call from Raina who said Ryan had said that there was a problem.  I told her my problems and she did apologize. 

I have never been treated like this before.",2,0,1

I'm tempted to knock a star off of every Vegas review just for being in Vegas.  That said, I thought that the Flamingo was decent.  

Pros: 
- Comfy beds
- Winding pool with waterfalls, lots of beach chairs,  a kid area, and several bars.
- Location - totally central on the strip, near Caesar's Palace, Paris and the Bellagio (among many others).  It's a more affordable option than the other hotels in that area.

Cons:
-The place seemed pretty dirty.  There were food scraps scattered about the hallways, stains all over the carpets, and just a general grimy feel about it.
-We had technical issues with the TV in our room and had to call down several times to get it fixed (Don't have TV at home so we were super excited to indulge in it); 
-Requested a king bed, received a room with two queen beds instead

One thing that saved us a lot of time was using the kiosks to check in.  The lines to do so with an actual staff member were ridiculous.  The kiosks took about a minute and were nearly empty.

i like how it is in the middle of the strip next to the quad and not too far from paris and planet hollywood and across is caesars palace hotel. i am in the prime location of las vegas. 

the price here is always pretty cheap. this time i have found my pricing at agodas.com for my recent trip for 3 nights from mon thru thurs was only 150 which was a bargain. but previous stays i had a host to help me book this and it was cheap too. for the weekends i have not paid 100 a room for this hotel so it means its cheaper on weekends than other hotels still. 

the rooms here are nice and roomy and has hard wood floors instead of carpets which is a plus for me. its cleaner and makes the room cleaner also since it is a old hotel. the stay here is always nice with a view of the swimming pool or the garden outside with the animals. 

the surrounding of this hotel there is a nice garden for the public to visit the animals and take pictures. also they have a few restaurants inside which is fancy and good such as center cut steak house. also if you like food courts they also have that too to choose from. also they have maragaritaville which is next to or inside flamingo hotel which is a plus to not wander off far and get drinks. very close to caesar palace and the quad and the linq which is a plus. 

overall i love this hotel and will keep continuing to book this hotel.",2,1,1

This hotel has a serious parking issue. As a paying guest of the hotel staying for a weekend, those guests physically staying at the casino should ALWAYS be able to either valet or have a spot to park their car in the parking lot.

We came as a family for Monster Jam finals and the entire weekend we were unable to park I. Their parking lot and the valet parking people told us they were full and we would have to park at another casino and walk over.

This is simply unacceptable, ridiculous, and horrible horrible customer service to paying patrons of the establishment.

When calling to discuss this issue, no one seemed to care and the valet people pretty much gave us the finger in front of our kids telling us its not their problem.

We loved our room and hotel but I don't think I could ever go back here after the parking. I felt lime we wasted our money on this hotel as we spent much of our family time have to hike from hotel to hotel with our kids just to get to our room.

Also, I've never seen such rude and disrespectful security at a pool... When is it ever ok to yell out ""hey white girl bring yo towel back!"" And the I proceeded to hear the same security guard complain about all the white girls at the pool...

Racist beyond words....

Let's start with valet. Waited in line for over thirty mins after being told we were going to be helped. The whole setup was chaotic. Went up to ask the guy what was going on and he said, ""you will be helped but this guy here was before you"" (not true, but ok). Asked a bellhop for a cart so maybe we could speed up the process ourselves and start loading our things and he rudely responded saying, ""no, this is for the valet guests"".......

Finally got helped and that same bellhop who denied us help earlier was loading our things. After filling out our ticket he mentioned that he accepted tips. Okay cool, this isn't my first rodeo. 

After everything was ready to be sent up to our room he proceeds to look us up and down. He once again repeated himself, I ACCEPT TIPS! I've never been so insulted and uncomfortable in my life. To have someone stare at you and wait for you to dig through your wallet for a tip as they stick out their hand is beyond me. I work in the service industry myself and would never ever do this to a paying customer (and I always generously tip).

Felt disturbed within the first hour of checking in to this hotel. The manager was nice to give us a $30 credit to the downstairs cafe, but I wish we could've just cancelled our whole reservation to stay somewhere else. 

Called up a set of towels the next day which took over an hour to arrive after they quoted us 15 minutes.

Upon checkout we had a charge of over $150. Good thing we looked at the bill as not only did they charge us $13 daily fee for valet but added a $24 charge for parking ($8\/day) which should not have been there. 

Step up your game Flamingo...was sorely disappointed in many aspects of this hotel. Would not recommend and will never stay here again. With a million other places to stay on the strip, you're much better off going anywhere else.",2,1,0

My issue is why couldn't they have just charged us in full when we checked in or at least gave us the whole bill.  Kind of annoying and I assume it was probably some not doing there job right.

Anyway for the upgrade we were put in a Neopolitan Suite which was nice and we were able to get it for way under what they usually charge.  We had lots of room and an amazingly comfortable king size bed.  We had a flatscreen tv by the bed and across the room which everytime we turn one off the other would turn on.  The large bathroom had a tv in the mirror which was a nice touch.  The shower and tub were seperate.  I would have loved a jacuzzi tub but it was just your average tub.

Tracy at the front desk stated that they thought it had been fixed and she was sorry and that some of the towers have BEEN having issues. Finally after 25 minutes Ricardo the manager got on the phone and of course I was pissed asked what they are doing to compensate, he said he could refund the resort fee of $20.16 and that was all. He was VERY UNHELPFUL AND RUDE. HE STARTED THAT IT WOULD BE FIXED IN AT LEAST AN HOUR AND IT IS 11:20 pm now. I asked if we could at least switch rooms and he said they had no rooms left. I went online right after and they had plenty of rooms. I also asked why they did not inform me at check in and he said that they did not know about the issues, WHICH WAS A LIE. Tracy at the front desk told me they were having issues already and knew know about it. NOT HAVING ANYMORE ROOMS WAS ALSO A LIE. The manager Ricardo treated me like I was was hustling for a free room, but I think if you pay for a hotel room the least you can get is hot water. The total lack of customer service by  manager to do anything about it was unbelievable. If they would have told me from the get go about the hot water I would have gone to Harrahs next door. So they choose to lie to us to get our money.

Too bad that they are not forthcoming about their status. In fact, Flamingo touts that they are newly Remodeled. 

Start with just getting in the Building, and you will either work up quite an appetite, or quite an appreciation for a well-organized entrance. Which the Flamingo doesn't have. They moved it. The fabled birds are more secluded (which is a good thin). Yet, whether you Valet, or schlepp to Self-Park, it's confusing and takes longer than you'd imagine to park and get to the Front Desk.

At Check-In, which should be easier with the Kiosks -- except the Computerized Kiosks don't seem to recognize all reservations, you have the pleasure of slogging down to the Byzantine line of Those Who Wait to Check In. (Ever seen the movie, 'Brazil'?)

After spending an hour on the phone the day before with Reservations, we were set for a certain type of room.  When I got to the speak to a Front Desk Representative, they had good news and bad news. The type of room we booked 'was sold out.' But she was going to upgrade us to a delightful Suite. Top Floor. 28.

As we approached the big door, I got a funny feeling. The clerk said it was about twice the size of the room we had booked. But this looked biiiig by the double doors. I thought, 'as long as there's no tiger or Mike Tyson, I'll be happy.'  Well. That's about all that WASN'T in this suite. It was  beat up bad, maybe by Mike Tyson. Scratched floors, and furniture circa 1979, maybe 1984. 3 Bathrooms, a giant living room and a far off bedroom. This would be the perfect place to stay for either A) A fraternity party or B) Someone who really didn't want to spend much together time with. Took some pictures of this place. 

After a phone call to Front Desk, we got moved to the 20th floor. A smaller, cleaner, more renovated room. Kinda like the room we originally had booked....

The bathroom still needed an upgrade, as the shower was pretty old. 

The pool party on Friday afternoon resembled a sardine can. OK, maybe if I was 23 it wouldn't  matter, but, I dunno.

OK, the Bright Spots: The Birds, as you walk through the first floor outdoor grounds, are Amazing. The cute Chapel of Love is worth a look as well, even if you're 'just browsing.' Adjacent to that is a way-cool statue and history of Benjamin ""Bugsy"" Siegel. The plaque will tell you the history of ownership of The Flamingo, including its first owner, Bugsy.

If I were on vacation I would have refused the room and gotten a refund and found another hotel. The rooms are old, and haven't been maintained at all (see picture I posted). The furniture is all chipped, the wall paper is peeling in several places, there are screw holes in the walls, and the security lock on the door won't latch.

The ""premium"" view which costs extra does give you a view of the Ferris wheel, but 95% of the view is of the totally flat casino roof several floors below. You can hear everything in the hall, though to be fair I haven't heard noise from the adjoining rooms.

It was the mold in the tub that finally motivated me to post this review and accompanying pictures. There are tons of affordable options in Vegas, so my advice is stay in either a newer hotel, or at least one with a maintenance routine.

I gave then two stars because the bed is reasonably comfortable and it was cheap, but I would never take a date or vacation here.

Edit: forgot to mention there is a resort fee, which is almost add much as the room, and DOES NOT INCLUDE WIFI!!!! ONCE you add in the mandatory resort fee and $15\/day (seriously) for Wi-Fi, you can get a much nicer place for less money.",5,1,1

Me and my friend arrived to this hotel after being given a comped room by the Linq. It took over an hour to check in. When we got our reservations we quickly made our way to the hotels elevators..... Out of 8 elevators only 1 worked. I repeat...1 working elevator for a hotel that size. Both the elevators and hallways were extremely hot. There wasn't any AC or ventilation on any of the floors we went to. To make matters worst the entire floor reeked of cigarette smoke. Now just about every place you go to in vegas will smell of cigarettes but at Flamingo your room will offer no escape from the stink.

Our room reeked of cigarette. It permeated everything. I also do not know who decorated the room but the place looked like a set of a gay porn film. Pink walls and white leather padded headboards...strange lighting fixtures... I can go on and on.

In all.... I wouldn't stay here unless it was free. Even then ide still opt to pay for something cheap near by. Do not spend your money here...its not worth it",4,5,0

Problem #1: If you valet your car, expect to get multiple dings on your car doors\/panels while staying there. Valet obviously doesn't care. I can understand maybe getting one by accident from the valet drivers, but 4 dings?? I only stayed here 3 nights. WTF?

Problem #2: I had an item stolen from my luggage upon departure. It happened from my room to bell holding downstairs. It was not an expensive item, but I noticed it was missing upon loading my car. (It was in an open shopping bag.) I immediately informed the hotel, who sent me to security, buried in the bowels of the hotel. Security took down my info, and then videotaped my complaint. I was told after they reviewed everything, they would be in touch with me. Which NEVER happened.

Upon returning home, I called the hotel to speak to someone about the damage to my car. I was bounced around a few times to others, when finally I was sent to a Michael Karr, Director of Hotel Operations. I could never get a hold of him, and he would never return my calls. I eventually gave up. Which is surely why they don't returns calls -- so unhappy customers will give up.

So fuck them, fuck Michael Karr, fuck the Flamingo Hotel. And fuck Harrah's, since they own the property and obviously don't hire staff who care about their customers getting ripped off or their cars getting damaged.",3,3,0

We had a two-bed room in the dog friendly level, although we didn't have a dog with us.  I think we had the cheapest rooms they offer. 

I was a little disappointed when we first entered the room because I have heard that the rooms are pink and the bathrooms are pink and the beds are pink, and everything is pink.  Our room was not pink, at all.  However it was clean and smelled normal, couldn't ask for much more.

The beds were pretty soft, almost too soft for our taste, I like a firm bed.  Our friend staying with us liked it though.  If you like soft beds then you are in luck.

The floors are weird, laminate instead of carpet.  Although after I thought about it, it made sense.  Laminate would be easier to clean and much more sanitary then carpet, so that was a plus.  

The bathroom was smallish but clean.  The sink backed up every time we used it and took forever to drain leaving a gross mess of face-wash water or toothpaste-spit water residue, nasty!

The shower was a bummer.  Absolutely ZERO water pressure and it took the water at least 15 minutes to warm up to hot water.  

Overall was not impressed, but I wasn't upset.  I would definitely stay here again because the hotel is in the center of the strip making it a great location.

My girlfriend wanted to stay here because of all the pink everywhere and the flamingos. I was skeptical but thought we would give it a try. How much time do you really spend in the room though in vegas? 

Upon arrival the hotel was nice, it does have an older feel to it especially compares to the cosmopolitan or Caesars right across the street. But it didn't look dirty or run down. The checkin line was a little slow, there was only 3 people checking in. We did try to check in at 9am though which may have been why. The lady at the front desk told us there were no rooms available but to try and come back at noon because the early check in fee is only $30 from 12-4. The actual check in process was pretty quick. I think the daily fee was $22 a day. Which included 2 people to use the weight room a day, a $20\/day room credit that can be used at the hotel bars or restaurants which was nice and we used it everyday.

We booked the standard room with a king size bed. The room was pretty nice. Dark wood floors. Flat screen tv. Bright pink curtains. The bathroom was not comparable at all. It was old looking and def needed an updating. Our view was of the pool and the back end of the hotel. Not a terrible view but it wasn't the strip view. The bed was pretty comfortable. There's no comforter just sheets with a thin blanket and a pink furry piece of fabric which was probably for decoration. The ac kept the room cool and comfortable. There are small glass cups in the room which hold almost no liquid. What I did was get water cups by the pool which are in clear solo cups and just brought those back to the room. 

We heard that the pool was one of the best free pools on the strip. If you plan on getting a lounge chair you need to get there at 8am when they open. People line up before 8 and the chairs go pretty fast. We brought our own towels but they do supply you with pool towels. The drinks are expensive but what do you expect? A bucket of 5 beers is $35. They also have specialty pink refillable cups that you can get frozen or mixed drinks in. I forget exactly the price but I think they were $26 and the refills $19 but I may be wrong. Your not allowed to bring in your own alcohol but they really didn't search the specialty cups so try if you like. The dj went on around noon which is also when it started to get a decent sized crowd. The dj played a mix of music so it was nice not to hear just one genre. Over the pool was pretty awesome as long as you can get over the prices for drinks. The palm trees, rock grotto and waterfall were very nice to be around. 

Check out is absolutely terrible. 11am is a norm time but the elevators to go down suck. I don't just mean over crowded but over crowded to the point where you have to wait a long time just to get space. We ended up taking a elevator up to the  the top floor and riding that down to the first floor only after it stopped at every floor which was packed with people trying to get down. The stairs are an option but once you hit the first floor you have to do some employee hallway maneuvering to actually get out to the lobby.  

Taxi stands go by pretty quick. There's also a shuttle that goes to the airport not sure what the price is. Also if you don't want to walk down the strip  use the hotel taxi stands to get a cab. They won't pick you up on the strip curb. Not are they allowed to have more than 5 passengers. And the drivers won't break that rule. We tried several times since we are from chicago and they let you jam 10 people in a 5 person car. They apparantly can lose their license if they have 1 too man people. 

Overall the hotel is nice and location is great. Hope this helps anyone.",2,0,0

The room had a weird smell so the girls I was roomed with sprayed perfume to mask it. It smelled like someone smoked cigarettes in the room and someone in another room smoked weed so it came in through the vents and did NOT go away for long. The AC is janky. If you're lucky, you'll get a well air conditioned room. The walls to the room are paper thin. Our neighbors kept us up all night since they got a room and I wish they got another. I could hear everything. It was disgusting..

Don't even get me started on the bathroom ! The glass cups in it looked unwashed for days and the only place you could get warm water was from the sink. Literally, taking a shower was like doing the ice bucket challenge for 10 minutes.. The sink water would build up and take a long time to go back down; seems like a plumbing problem. 

The service there is terrible ! Room service isn't available for a reasonable amount of time and for the entire three days I stayed at this place the maids did NOT clean the room.. Also, all the restaurants and what not at the hotel are pricey (water is like $4).

The put us on the executive floor (28) since the wait was extreme, the only catch being that it was a king bed, not usually a big deal except that it was a male friend , not my wife this trip.  We expressed our displeasure and they assured us that they would move us in morning to a two bed option on the same floor. Since neither of us intending on sleeping it worked out just fine. 
The staff were fantastic. The room was clean with faux wood floors. The bathroom needed a makeover, but all in all very nice.

An hour later they called me back saying the original suite I was supposed to have was ready. We move our things back to that suite and it had an industrial fan in it because there was a leak.... It is now 9pm and we are just getting into our room. Keep in mind the room is a VERY ugly suite that is outdated and gross... Of course I wasn't comp'd for the troubles.

Great price, great location, and got a free upgrade to the top floor. I was with a group of girls (all in our twenties) for my bachelorette party. We didn't care if it was fancy or not, but it was nicer than we expected.

My favorite part is the flamingo habitat... In the concrete jungle that is Vegas, it's so nice to have a peaceful patch of land with waterfalls, ponds, birds, palm trees, and greenery. I'm from Vancouver so I'm used to lots of ""green"" - it was definitely a nice touch and the pond area \/ plants and grass was very well kept. 

I think the flamingo is an ideal place for young people to stay at who aren't looking for anything fancy, but still want something nice in the heart of the strip.",1,0,0

The pool is pretty nice. But they don't enforce guest-only access, so anybody walking off the street can enter. When I was there last week, a bunch of drunk, disgusting fatass guys were loudly commenting about women's bodies. Klassy. 

Back to the hotel. If you can afford a little extra, request to stay in the GO rooms. This section of the hotel was recently renovated (mid 2006), so it's a lot nicer. They have 42"" tvs, drapes that open with a switch, a stereo that you can plug your  iPod into, and oddly, a small TV screen that's built into the bathroom mirror. You can watch TV while taking a shower or bath! These rooms were constructed & decorated quickly and on the cheap, so don't be surprised if you see wall paper starting to peel or have lights that don't work right.  The rooms are fairly small. And they don't have mini-fridges. The bathroom doors are sliding frosted glass - not the most private set up for a bathroom. 

Room service is decent , 24\/7, and relatively inexpensive. They serve breakfast at all times. The gym is small but they have treadmills and elliptical machines. 

I stayed here for a conference. The facilities were decent, nothing extraordinary though. It's a huge hotel and I found myself pretty lost at times.

We rented a basic hotel room mainly because you don't spend much time in your hotel room on vacation anyway. I did not expect what we got, which was a dirty old room that had not been updated since the 90s. The bathroom was really gross with a tiny shower. I try to pack light so I normally end up using the hotel shampoos and soaps. Their shampoo was so cheap it was the same consistency as water and left my hair feeling like shit. Very disappointing stay. And I did not just run to post a review on Yelp. I actually tried to resolve this issue with management and they were not at all accommodating. Basically I was told that this is what to expect from their basic rooms, which is sad because I've stayed on holiday inns with nicer rooms!  We originally were going to book another night there too because we arrived in Vegas a little later than planned, but decided we wanted nothing more to do with the Flamingo and headed to the Luxor which turned out to be exactly what we wanted and were very happy there.

They tried pitching me on the upgraded ""Go-Room"" over the phone, the main advantage to that being that it had a TV in bathroom. I declined. 

The room I did get was old, nasty, and had some very questionable stains on the carpet right by the bed. I'm glad I left my black light at home, because god only knows.... 

Needless to say I never walked around with bare feet. 

I did see the ""Go-Room,"" as some of my friends who were staying there got one. It had a nicer TV and nicer furniture, but also a nasty-ass Neapolitan color scheme. Not worth it either.

The Flamingo is definitely not the charming art deco hotel I stayed in a decade ago. 
The reception area is drab and the front desk staff unfriendly.  The initial room my daughter and I were assigned was already occupied.  The desk clerk blamed the computer, muttered an ""I'm sorry"" and assigned us a different room in the ""un-renovated"" section of the hotel.   
The elevator made random stops to floors that no one had selected.  By the end of our stay it had become a running joke with other guests.  The ceiling light in our room did not work and we soon discovered that the running water in the sink had only one temperature...  ice cold.  If you wanted to wash you face with warm water, you had to use the bathtub.  The room furniture was old and mismatched, and the floor was a brown vinyl that was supposed to look like wood.  Everything seemed dirty.  The bed had a cover across the bottom that looked like an old shag rug from the 60's.  I later found a fingernail (not mine) in the fibers.   

Later in my stay, when we were in the pool area for a short time, our room was robbed.  There was no sign of forced entry, but housekeeping had cleaned the room while we were gone.  After dialing repeatedly, I was finally able to get the Guest Services button on the phone to work.  After calling three times for security, and being told they would be up right away, we finally went to the security office in the basement of the hotel. A security officer took our report, and that was it.  Although management gave me a $50 food credit after I expressed my displeasure, overall my concerns were met with indifference and hostility.  A report was filed with CCMSI,  a Third Party Risk Management firm retained by Flamingo Las Vegas to review and administer incident reports.

This is an older hotel, with an interesting mob history. It's not luxurious, but it does the trick for a relatively inexpensive price. I recommend doing early checkin then picking up your keys and room directions at one of the kiosks instead of the front desk. In today's day and age, why wait 20 minutes to check in when they give you that option?

Negatives: Very few amenities here. No fridge, which would have been nice for my stay. The room wasn't great, dirty floor, safe locked with door open (had to get a guy to open it), etc. but it wasn't horrendously awful either. In my quest for cheap hotel rooms I have certainly seen worse. Lots of resort fees and a $50 deposit per night, but they are upfront about it. I'm guessing most Vegas hotels charge you a couple hundred in fees as well.

Worst: the Wyndham timeshare people! I kept getting harassed by them. Practically a dozen times. ""Excuse me ma'am where are you from?"" They will hunt you down from across the casino and start an unrequited conversation with you. I did some research and it's all a scam, but that's pretty obvious from their marketing techniques and persistence. Flamingo please get rid of these shady, annoying people!

Now positives: parking in their garage is free, which was nice. Location is central to the strip, and right off the Linq area of restaurants and attractions. It's part of Caesar's, so your purchases go towards Total Rewards if you're into that thing. Also, the birds and fish outside are pretty cool.

It had modern styling and amenities such as a flat screen t.v., radio with IPOD adapter, internet (but with a fee) The bathroom had a stand up shower and a tub which was on the small size.  Another nice feature is that that was a mini t.v. inside the mirror and if you wanted you can watch cartoons while sitting on the throne =P.

I do not know where to start. This was our 3rd stay at this hotel but the 2 other times were over 14 years ago, so I don't know what  has happened to this place but it was God awful. I don't know where to start.....

First off the staff is cranky, rude and unhelpful.  We booked 5 rooms on expedia.  Each room was booked with the person's name who would be staying.  When we called ahead because a person in our group got ill on the flight to Vegas and we asked about early check in, the rude reservation clerk stated ""no one is registered under that name"" we asked her to check different spellings and before we could even give her a suggestion, she rudely said ""I ALREADY CHECKED IT THAT WAY, NO ONE HAS A RESERVATION UNDER THAT NAME!!!""    We explained to Miss Rudy-pants that we paid in FULL at the time of booking so, ""if you could, please check again""   She disconnected us. We called back, asked for a manger and was on hold for over 35 minutes.  Finally we called the main reservation line and the customer service was able to find the booking. Our party was  able to check in early, for a small fee, which she tried to give cash but it was not accepted.  Our friend used her debit card and was charged a  $100 deposit without being told this would happen and that of course made her short in her bank account. (college student).

We checked into our room and almost slipped and fell on a large puddle on the floor. The AC was leaking.  A call to the front desk was met with another snotty customer rep who was more interested in the fact that 2 in our party were 19 and 20 1\/2 and  had their own rooms. Her suggestion was we should all sleep together in the same bed like hillbillies.  Not to mention we were charged a $100 deposit for each of the rooms occupied by those under 21 and the front desk NEVER  mentioned any problems or rules about under 21 guests occupying a room.

We were never offered another room. The maintence guy showed up and said ""oh that is just a little condensation""   It was about 12 inches around and on a dark floor. Guess Flamingo does not care if we break a hip in a fall in their room.  The condition apparently has been on going as the room smelled of mold.

Problem fixed we moved on to the pool area.  They have a section for 21 and over. Just a heads up, prepare to undergo a full body search by an armmed guard. Oh...if you buy a coffee at Mrs. Fields prior to going into the pool, better drink it fast cause, as the guard said ""NO FOOD, NO DRINK FROM OUTSIDE""  WTF??   We bought it a few feet away inside the hotel.   The guard also does not like tampons in your purse or he was a total moron because he pulled out the package and asked ""what's this"".

Next night at  4am, the A\/C again dripped and dripped.  Call to the front desk, waiting 45 mins, no show.  Call a second time waited 2 hours, again a no show. Finally gave up.

Staff is untrained, rude and nasty.  We asked one employee what time the restaurant was open til and was told ""oh it closed"" only to find out it is a 24 hour place!!  

I guess the Korean tourist summed it up best when he let one smelly fart rip  while we tried to enter our room!         THIS PLACE SUCKS!!",2,4,0

It sort of has a weird layout that you'll either love or hate (like glass sliding bathroom doors) but overall we liked it.

We didn't eat there or see any of the entertainment there. We did gamble for like $3 minutes but after losing $20 in 3 minutes we left the casino and went in saw Beatles LOVE. 

Someone was banging on the door at 3am trying to get into their room. It woke me up, but hey its Vegas, I bet there is a lot of that.

The only complaint I have about the place is at check-out we were trying to get on an elevator and it literally took 20 minutes for one to open that was not packed; with 5 bags it felt like a life time.

I got in around 1:30pm and made reservations for a restaurant with the concierge as soon as I got there and the lady was very helpful and nice. She also told me that I should be able to check-in no problem even though it was way before 4pm which is the check-in time. The line was fairly short and I was able to check-in no problem which was great!

The room was very nice for the price and clean. There was a nice large flat screen TV, automated curtains to a lovely view of the pool area, a mini fridge, a hairdryer, an iron, and a safe in the closet. 

Unfortunately the pool area was being remodeled so there was just one small pool area. It was ok though since my bf and I went to Bally's or Ceaser's Palace's pool no problem. The official summer season for Vegas doesn't begin until next Friday which was a bummer since a lot of the pools were closed, the service wasn't great at the casino floors, etc. 

Also a great location! The flamingo is right across the street from all the big hotels such as Ceaser's Palace, the Bellagio, etc. I was able to walk everywhere without having to take a cab. If you're looking for a nice basic room I would highly recommend this place. Honestly, you don't spend that much time in your room while at Vegas.

Although a few people have said that its ""tired"" or ""old,"" I think that it pays homage to the way the hotels and casinos were when the strip was first being built.  This is a 50s-era hotel that still has some original furnishings.  The rooms are great.  I'm not sure what a ""Go Room"" is, but we just had a standard two-double bed room.  Great prices (much less than the other hotels on the strip) and every amenity you can imagine.  Our rooms were big, the beds were super comfortable and the bathroom was really nice.  The hotel service and staff were super friendly and very prompt with the cleaning of the rooms or room service.   The front desk staff were also very friendly and helpful in suggesting things to do during the day if we didn't want to hit up the casinos.  

The casino itself is really great - it's big (almost like three separate rooms) and there's all the card tables and slot machines you could imagine.  I found that the service here at the machines\/tables was much faster than at other casinos.  Every time I started playing something a server would come and take a drink order - it was great.  It was often slower or non-existent at other casinos.  

The pools were also great.  There was a pool for everyone (including kids) and a pool for adults only - the adult pool was great because there was prompt bar service and very few people.  The area around the pools is also great, as well.  It's kind of like a crazy rain forest jungle with some wildlife hanging around and a path to walk through and see everything.

Cons: We got the cheapest double queen room. We took the habitat elevator to get there. I wish we had upgraded. The beds were nice and it was clean but the furniture was old. The bathroom was pretty gross. It was clean. But the ceiling in the shower was moldy and disgusting. I didn't walk in the room without my sandals.

Pros: the hotel is on the strip and close to many of the best hotels. Also the monorail picks up just outside the hotel. And the hotel is the cheapest one except for Harrah's which had worse reviews. We had the Do Not Disturb on the door when we got back the phone was blinking. The ed out that housekeeping had called to see if we needed anything. It took awhile to get the message, but I thought that was pretty nice.

There is a bird habitat with flamingos, parrots, rescued pelicans, turtles, and fish. 

The pool is really cool, there's an all age pool with a waterslide, and there's a 21+ pool with a waterfall and club music. 

Cons: The pool is only 3 ft deep! You have to pay for a cabana or day bed. It's not relaxing with club music playing the whole time, and it closes at 5! I am still in shock that it closes at 5- I wanted to swim at night, but no the pool's closed.

I am talking about $2500 and getting credit for $1200, which was a total loss.  
The rooms are not clean and kept up.  The elevators take a long waiting time and some don't work at all.  Getting service on the floor takes too long.  This is the worst casino I have ever been at and you will not get comped like any other Caesars casino.  You can go to any other Caesar casino and get comped for play, get a better room, buffet, and shows, but not at the Flamingo.  

This was the worst stay in Las Vegas.  If this was my first stay in Las Vegas I would wonder how the other casinos treat their clients.  But, coming to Las Vegas at least 5 times a year I know what you should get at the casinos for play.",0,0,0

One of the remaining OG hotels on the strip.  Everything reeks of smoke.  Tore up waitresses.  Greasy cafes and buffets.  Half dead animals that would scream kill me if they could to take pictures with.  Definitely a step down from the luxury resorts, but I like it here.  My kind of Vegas, at least until I hit that Wheel of Fortune jackpot. 

Great center strip location.  Easy to get to everything.  Standard rooms are decent, GO rooms are actually amazing and worth the upgrade, though still small.  

Good vibe in the casino, people are usually here to have fun.  They have a gogo area with the...slightly more attractive dealers up front.  But I don't really like gambling here too much since the limits are a little too low, like $10 pai gow.  It sucks to be losing hands while someone else on the table is barely betting anything and constantly winning (yeah I'm gonna hate like that).  Good to come here and kill some time though, better than the IP.  Dear God, anything but the IP.",4,7,4

I had put down the room under my name with my credit card and I gave them a call the day before to change the rooms under a different person just for the first night because I couldn't get the day off at my work for Thursday night. I clearly told billing customer service I was going to arrive Friday night. She had told me that was fine that when I arrived just to go to the counter with the other person to change the credit card to mine. I asked her like three times if she needed the other persons credit card for the reservation and she clearly told me no that as long as the other person showed up and that she would only pay resort fees at the counter. Perfect that sounded like a good plan. I get to the hotel Friday night my friend comes down to remove her credit card and put my credit card which was no hassle. But for them to tell me that one of the rooms was cancelled because I didn't check in on Thursday night. The only reason why I had called the day before is for this little mix up not to happen and they end up telling me they had cancelled the other room because I wasn't there. Ok! What's the whole point on calling and them telling me one thing and ended up doing another thing. At that point I was so fed up with the manager, he was no help at all and was not reasonable at all. He had told me there was no record of me calling when I clearly showed him my phone with the number of costumer service. He didn't even bother checking like ok sir, I'm not quite sure how he's even a manager there. At the end I didn't even want to deal with it any more and I told them him one room was fine BUT that I hoped at the end we don't get double charged for the 2 rooms, I honestly told him like 3 times and he stated that we were only going to get charged for one room and only on MY credit card. Sunday morning comes we check out and I had told the lady one more time I just wanted to make sure we wont get double charged and she said no you're fine you're only getting charged for one room for 3 nights to your credit card and not your friends credit card. She gave me my receipt and everything to find out today 4\/11 morning that my friend also got charged for the 3 nights.

Just came back today from vegas.  We stayed at the Flamingo since we found a great deal online for the Go Get Wet Pool Package that included 2 complimentary frozen drinks or beer and a pool kit with the new Go rooms. Upon arriving it took us 2 hours to check in since we ran into some problems.  The package I booked was for 3 days and was booked straight from the actual hotel site.  After checking in we noticed we were charged for an extra night which made no sense since when you purchase any packages thru their hotel site it must be paid in full.  They told us that the package only consist of 2 days and that we had to pay for the 3rd night.  TELL ME WHY WOULD I BOOK A  2 DAY PACKAGE IF I AM STAYING FOR 3 NIGHTS?!? are u stupid no where said it was a 2 day package...i even busted out the itinerary and confirmation for them to look at.  After giving us the run around for an hour we finally talked to the front desk manager and she was stupid as hell too. Finally everything got straighten out because these people that worked at this hotel didnt know what the hell they were doing. I will defin be contacting Harrah's Entertainment, Inc. and WILL NOT BE RETURNING.

now for my review on the room.  dont even get me started.  came here for me 25th bday and with the problems checking in my birthday was starting to become shitty.  we got the go room since it looked really nice online...too bad totally not. 

-5 cigarette burn holes in the blanket.
-Remote was missing back cover.
-The door handle to the bathroom was broken and swinging back and forth.
-The vinyl pink wallpaper was peeling off the bathroom wall.
-No extra toilet paper.  there was like less than half a roll on the holder.
-3 big dark stains in the carpet
-Caulking in shower was coming off and all moldy
-All 3 lamps in room did not work
-Ceiling light had 3 dead bulbs.

Pool here sucks butt.

Headed to the pool Saturday morning.  Pool was packed full of people just drinking and mingling around.  You really cant even swim just post and drink.  We went to claim our free drinks so we got 2 strawberry margaritas which consist of no alcohol.  We should of got beers instead.  Then went to go get our pool kit ( Vegas Hat, Sun Block, and aloe wipes) which we actually is charged to the room and you get a receipt and when u check out u give the front desk the receipt and they reverse the charge. How inconvenient.   Pool sucked so we all decided to go to the Go Pool for the 21 and up with European sun bathing.  Thought it was be less people since girls do get in free but guys have to pay.  It was pointless since the minute was walked in we walked back out.  There was nothing but old people there and heavy set woman with their boobs all out I DO NOT want to see that.  no offense but damn!  I wasn't there to see boobs I really just wanted to listen to music and hang with friends where there wasn't going to be tons of kids and people.

I was weary because of some of the negative reviews written on here, but I'll be honest, I'm glad I stayed here. Is it the Bellagio? Of course not, so to everyone complaining about how it's outdated, or the nearby construction, or the hallway carpets, just keep in mind you get what you pay for, and that's meant to be a dig on the Flamingo, but when you're paying anywhere from 30-70 a night, whereas Caesar's charges at least twice to three times that, well... there's a reason! 
Yeah, the hallway carpets need to be replaced. But are hallway carpets really going to hinder or enhance your stay?!? The elevators were fast and reliable, the staff was very friendly, and the showers were nice (excellent water pressure! unfortunately, in my room, the water built up a tad in the tub, don't know if the drain was partially plugged up or something but whatever). The best part was the bed though, it was super soft but still firm (almost like a tempur pedic). 
However, there are a couple of things that prevent me from giving it 5 stars. The walls are thinner than an aspiring New York model. Luckily I don't think anyone was booked in the rooms to the side of me, but I was on the 24th floor and could hear the music coming from a little patio bar down by the hotel shops and pool around 9 pm, and I also heard people coming and going as if my door was wide open. And the hotel itself makes weird little noises, almost like an old house, at night. I think its the A\/C unit in the bathroom making the little creaks but who knows. If you're a loud sleeper (or drunk) you'll be fine though. Also, if you're about 6'3"" or taller you wont fit in the shower.
I had heard the tables at the Flamingo were quite generous, but I didn't experience any of that. I didn't lose my shirt, but never really got on a roll and never witnessed anyone really excited to be gambling there...
All in all though, the Flamingo really is a good value. It's got a great location, as you're within a couple minutes walking distance of Paris, Bally's, Caesar's, Mirage, etc...

I liked that it had self check-in and check-out so you can avoid the long line at the counter.  

When we were trying to check-in, one of the reps asked us where we were from, and told us to line up, then ignored us.  Afterwards, I went to the test the self check-in, and had another rep that was much nicer in her customer service.  As we were leaving, the first rep that we encountered came back and tried to sell us on some packages, and tried to entice us with free stuff.  We were being nice and followed him to see what he was talking about, but then it confirmed our theory that nothing is free in the world because he was trying to get us to spend 2-4 hours listening about something similar to time shares.  We booked it out of there quick since we had better things to do, like sleep.

The room that I got looked like it got updated, but I won't really know since it was the first time I stayed at this hotel.

Our bathroom light was busted all night even after numerous calls to have it fixed. Pretty much had to get ready by phone light and couldn't shower. Caused us to be late for dinner with friends and ruined the night. We also were supposed to have a fridge in our room and we had to call a few times for that to be delivered. 

We were not offered another room until we had to call again the next morning and even then I finally had to debate with them for 30 min to get only $100 off the room. They wouldn't even comp it for the awful experience and for ruining our plans. They told us either to wait for it to be fixed or to just deal with it because the only other rooms they had were smoking and they were not going to upgrade us for their poor excuse of a hotel room. Plus they didn't even give us another fridge so all the food we had, needed to be thrown away. 

Ana R. (Previous review was removed for privacy concerns so I can't post the last name but maybe if she wasn't so awful at her job she wouldn't have to worry about her name being in my review) was the manager on duty at the time and had absolutely zero customer service skills and offered no help. She told us that since we used the room to sleep in(we couldn't move because no other rooms were available other than smoking and we shouldn't have to subject ourselves to a nasty smelling room) she wouldn't comp it and it wasn't the hotels fault our plans were ruined. Are you kidding me?! That is the level of customer service you hire especially from a manager? How has she not been fired yet?

That is just the room. The rest of the hotel is falling apart. All of the elevators stop at every floor whether their is someone there or not, most of the elevators have white out drawn numbers because they are too cheap to buy 25 cent number plates, the casino smells awful, the carpets are fading and curling up on most of the floor, the buffet is a joke for $40 that has sub standard food and nothing of value. The most upscale thing they had their was a salmon filet and it was over seasoned and super fishy smelling and tasting. 

This deserves its own mention as well, they block your cell signal in most of the rooms and then force you to pay for WiFi.

I did enjoy the built-in TV in the mirror in the bathroom. My BF thought I fell in the toilet because I was taking so damn long but I just had to reassure him that I was just watching TV LOL! And I didn't mind the pink florenscent lighting in the bathroom. Pink is my favorite color!

Sure the casino floor can be smoky but I really didn't care because as a smoker, I was contributing to the smokiness.

The supervisors Josh and Ramon were the most unhelpful human beings I've beer talked to in my life. When we told them we had 8 people in the room they said ""that room does not hold eight people. We charge $30 extra a night per person"" WTH!!! We called and asked for a room for 8 people and you want to charge us extra for YOUR MISTAKE??? 

Also none of the ice machines worked on our floor, the floor below us and the floor above us. The front desk wanted to charge us EIGHT DOLLARS FOR ICE. 

All they care about is getting as much money as possible. I hate you Flamingo. I used to love you but now I'm a sad angry customer.",12,5,5

I am going to base my review on that alone.  You are not going to get 5 star accommodations for this price!  We did not stay in a GO room.  It probably would've been worth the extra $30 a night for the upgrade.  The rooms are outdated, carpet is stained, bathroom floor is disgusting (but the toilet bowl and shower were clean).  

The pool is beautiful!  We purchased a cabana and day bed and had a great day at the pool.  Our hostess, John was great!  Unfortunately the weather did not cooperate, so only one day was spent at the pool!  

The location is great!  Walking distance to all the great attractions!  So, if you are looking to spend your money on eating, gambling, shopping, and basically just need a place to sleep and shower, this is the place for you!  However, if you are looking for a 5 star hotel experience, this is definitely not the place for you!  You definitely get what you pay for here!

There was a queen size bed, very clean and well kept (even after the remodeling of the hotel) and had switch controlled blinds. Best part ever! We get kinda lazy lol. 

The casino and everything was well kept and everything just looked nice even if it was an older hotel on the strip. Now my tip: don't wait in the long line for checking in. Head over to their I believe players counter and get a membership. Then you can ditch that long line you're in for non members and wait in the much shorter faster line for members only.

I remember staying here years ago (since I've tended to stay at 5 star resorts i.e. Wynn, palazzo, encore) and for some reason they've warped back in time. Upon check in the front staff was very helpful until I asked about the swimming pool which tentatively should open March 3, but they stated they weren't sure and it depended on the weather. Upon checking in into the room the first evening we had a mishap where our shower went from cold to hot and had to Area for warm water. We called the front as we were preparing to head out for the evening and the faucet was never fixed. I spoke to an assistant manager the next morning at this point and once again offered to send an engineer which I disagreed to and asked for a room change. I asked for a complimentary upgrade at this point and she stated no, simply no with no apology that we had to move all our luggage to a new room. I'm not sure if I'm used to customer service at upscale resorts but as I've stated and various hotels throughout the United States I feel the Flamingo is no where up to par with their counterparts. I have on more night here and honestly at this point I will never stay here again and seeing the quality of the room and customer service attitude is all in dismay, I dread staying here another evening and the mold spores in the vents and smell from the heater is seriously a health hazard.

I was embarrassed to even tell people where we stayed, it's that bad.  The casino portion isn't great either.  We only gambled there for maybe an hour or two the entire duration of our stay, even though our hotel room was there.  

The absolute worst to me were the thin walls.  I could hear ENTIRE conversations, word for word, as if the person was in MY room.  Our room neighbors had parties every night and were screaming banshees acting like idiots.  I have no problems with partiers, I like to get crazy too, but damn.

I have always heard about the Flamingo, and decided to give it a shot.  I've grown to understand you don't stay in Vegas for the hotel room, cause you're not in it very often.  I will say this, the bathroom is very small, so if you're with a couple girls, it may be kind of hard for them all to get ready at the same time.  We stayed in the standard room, so the price was really nice, which made me feel pretty good about it being mediocre.

Three hours later, and after 5 calls later up to the hotel manager, we finally got one pillow and one blanket around 1:30AM! My second complaint is regarding valet. After pleading to the valet attendant that there were no more self-parking spaces, they still would not take my car and indicated that they don't have any more parking space. I explained that I saw plenty of valet parking spaces and then they replied those are reserved for Diamond Star members and handicaps and told me to park my car on the other side of the hotel. My third complaint is when the friends of mine asked to have the room heater fixed since it was under 40 degrees outside. No HVAC repairman came the whole night so my friends froze their buts off.

I guess the 1 star I'm forced to give will be for the location because this was the worst hotel experience I've had in Vegas thanks to the horrible customer service provided by management, in particular, Chris Lenzo.

We went over memorial weekend and when we checked in, nothing was said about the parking situation. The website said parking is available. We seriously circled the parking structure for over an hour and found nothing! People were even illegally double parked in the lot because it was just that bad. The valet was also full and when we tried to valet, they said the lot was full. We asked where we could park since the self park was also full and she told us to figure it out! We were not redirected to an overflow lot so we were forced to park at another hotel and walk several blocks even though we are guests at the hotel!

We spoke to the manager, Chris Lenzo, after we parked blocks away and we asked him why they did not tell guests about this situation when he himself said they were expecting issues with the parking due to the busy memorial weekend. We asked him how they just expect guests to figure it out. I told him on the website it says parking is available and he said ""it's like when you go to a bank, they are open from 9-5 and then they're closed so they're no longer available"" and i said ""yeah, but your hotel and parking structure is open 24 hours!"" and he responded ""I guess all I can do for you is make bad analogies..."" REALLY? Are you freaking joking me? WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE! He had such an attitude because we were two twenty-something girls filing a complaint. Had it been an older person, I'm sure it wouldn't have copped such an attitude.

I'm sorry sir but how are you the manager?! The janitor of the hotel could have done a better job! The best part was that he had security backup waiting behind us and we didn't even raise our voice. Are you scared of a couple of girls?

WILL NEVER BE BACK!

Even at Treasure Island, I had a bad experience once and they offered us a free night stay next time we returned.

Stayed in a Go Luxury room with view - press a button to open the drapes and the view of the front of Caesars unfolds before your eyes. Empty fridge in the room to take some bottles of water stocked from the nearby CVS.

Good part of the strip to act as a base, opposite Caesars\/ Bellagio, next to Ballys\/Paris, easy enough to walk to Venetian \/ Wynn in one direction, or Cosmopolitan \/ MGM in the other. We got cabs sometimes but a lot less than if we had been at one end of the strip or the other. 

Still too much BS 6:5 blackjack especially on any of the tables nearer the front of the casino where they recruit younger \/ more attractive dealers to sucker you in, and they have the occasional pole-dancer behind the tables with the worst odds. But they have plenty of OK (friendly but older) dealers if you are playing more $$ per hand. The range of bottled beers available at the table seems to have dropped off from last visit but maybe I'm confusing it with Ballys or one of the other ones nearby.

Breakfast buffet had all the standard breakfast things but was pretty crappy quality for around $15-16 I think. Plenty of choice, and eat as much as you want, but when the food is no better than a typical stop on the interstate, you don't really feel the need to keep going back up for more after a couple of platefuls. Only tried it once and there was zero line at 8am the Sunday after Thanksgiving before our flight. Glad I didn't go at a busier time and wait in line - though it's a lower price, this is a level below Paris, Rio or any of the other good buffets run by the same group.

Also, it bugs me that the Caesars\/ Flamingo\/ Ballys\/ Paris\/ Rio\/ Bills\/ Harrahs group proudly advertise 'never a resort fee' but to use all the amenities of the room you do need to pay a supplement - $13.99\/day inroom wifi or $24.99\/day hotel-wide wifi (which didn't really cover everywhere but reached a few of the bars\/gaming areas).

Think about the location of this casino, on the strip.  Where are you going to find a hotel on the strip on weekends under like $100? Why complain about the hotel?  You want 5-star, go to Bellagio or Wynn's and pay $200 and up on weekends.  You get for what you pay.  Flamingo's has its value.

This is the only casino that I can come close to winning.  I don't stand a chance in other casinos.  Remember if you're going to a casino for gambling, you need to stay at one that you are comfortable with and lets you win.  Don't forget to take advantage of the Total Rewards.  They really reward you.  I got a couple of Gucci purses, cash for driving here, and concert tickets.",2,0,1

Yes, its right on the Strip so its convenient but LINQ is way better. 

We got a strip view room which i thought at first was cool.nope. BIG MISTAKE. there was a loud af noise emitting from a nearby nighclub and it kept me awake even with earplug. 
Now i know its Vegas, probably most of the people are passed out to even notice that noise but i had a long drive back home in the morning so i needed that sleep.
How the hell do they charge for a loud room  like that? 
Non smoking room but right next to our room was an elevater which you can smoke there? 
Room is clean but its not worth it

Never ever will i stay there again.",6,0,0

Sure Flamingo is an anchor on the Strip with its history and flashy signage, but I think therein lies the question; better to burn out than fade away? It's already done. The casino reeks of smoke and draining retirement funds. It's just not a lively place anymore. The store displays are hilariously dated and tacky. 

The drinks at the bar looked pretty gross and all of the staff looked grumpy and overworked. 

The casino's bill breaker\/ticket redemptions are misplaced and 3\/4 of them were out of order. There really should be a minimum number of machines per floor size to try and control addictions. I noticed the same issue at Planet Hollywood. Is this happening on purpose to try and dissuade gamblers from waiting in line for the 1 working machine?

Also, the flamingos are kept outside during brisk temperatures. I wouldn't want to come here to stay and if I had children I would keep them away, -there are definitely livelier places on the strip.  I suggest Bally's or Venetian for a quick round of roulette instead.",2,2,2

We were almost glad to be out of the hotel most of the day. 
1\/ customer service. We booked 2 rooms with 2 queen beds to fit 6 people. As we arrived, the hotel told us that only one room was available with 2 queens. We had to fit few people on the couch with no blankets as they NEVER ended bringing extra sheets for us - we called 4 times!!!). 
I never called the lobby that many times at a hotel..and get completely ignored every.single.time!!
Nothing was done to apologize nor to make our stay better. Kudos!!! 
2\/ elevators : they probably have the least efficient elevators system. 3 of them were out of service. So 3 left to serve the entire building! Believe me, I know every single detail of the elevator doors now. Estimate waiting time was 10-15min. I hope you're no in a rush to party! Or make sure to tell your friends to start without you. 
3\/ hotel & rooms : oh please..this is a hotel ON the strip.. Please respect your customers and put a little bit more effort in renovation, cleaning, house keeping.. 
The room itself was pretty clean and not too shabby looking. But all doors are dirty, hallway and elevators aren't that clean either. I know you guys are busy but you have lost me + my 5 friends as Flamingo customers. 
4\/ check in. If you want people to enjoy Vegas, you gotta start working on your check in process. Line was HUGE when we got there around 7pm. I understand it is rush hour but then put the right amount of resources to make your system more efficient. 
5\/ trashy atmosphere : ambiance and atmosphere are really trashy. Very small lobby, no big effort put in decoration. 

Only positive point is that it is directly connected to Margaritaville and that helped us forget this experience.

I stayed here for three nights in late January 2017, midweek. It was my second stay here. Last time (see prev review) I called the hotel ""a fine place to crash""; this time, it was a pretty dang good hotel. Check-in was quick, my room was perfectly clean, the wifi worked well, the staff (from desk clerks to valets) are friendly and helpful, and I even had a nice view of the Linq. The bed was *super* comfortable. Also, I had a real problem in that the people in the adjoining room (total strangers) had a crying baby who was keeping me up when I was trying to go to sleep (come ON people... don't bring your young infant to Vegas, just DON'T). I called the front desk and they very quickly moved moved me to a different room with no trouble or delay at all. The problem wasn't their fault, and they handled it perfectly.

The location of this hotel is perfect-- across from all the awesomeness of Caesar's (spa, buffet, pools) without paying Caesar's prices, and it's easy to walk to both ends of the Strip from your front door. The prices are highly competitive, and the rooms are stylish, especially given what you're paying. My only gripes are that the outlets are in the most impossible locations (good luck lying in bed while charging your phone, unless you have a 15-foot cable), and the showers are unpredictable (the one on my first stay was terrible, with settings of Dribble or Remove Paint From Wall; this time mine was fine, but my best friend's, on the same floor, was as bad as my first one).

I recommend getting a room that's not facing the Linq, because even though the view is nice, it's loud until late at night. If you're a night owl in Vegas it won't matter. If you want to go to bed at midnight, it's not ideal. Overall, this hotel is a great value and I would definitely stay here again.",3,0,0

I booked a GO room well in advance for a friend's bachelorette party through the flamingos website. After checking-in and arriving to the room I realized they didn't give me GO room and in fact down-graded me to an absolutely hideous room with the most awful smell for the price of the GO room. Obviously dissatisfied I called to speak with a manager who directed me to return to check-in. I go back and have to wait another 45 minutes in-line to get this matter taken care of. Once at the front, I speak with the manager and tell him I booked a GO room, but they placed me in a downgraded awfully smelling room. He proceeds to tell me that he has no more GO rooms because I booked through a third party website. I then take out my phone to show him the email showing the reservation was made through their site and not some third party. His response is ""oh yeah"". I explain to him I'm not trying to be difficult to which he responds to with ""ha"". I proceed to tell him that this is their mistake not mine and he should rectify it. He then tells me he only has one king sized GO room and one with two queen beds on the pet floor. I have two girls staying with me so I take room on the pet floor. Awful customer  service topped off with a rude manager.

Next day, the girls want to go to the pool. We pay $600 for a bed at the pool and watered down drinks. Terrible customer service again when asked to bring better drinks. 

Overall, this was an awful experience, but what can you expect when staying at the flamingo. Only reason I stayed here  was one of bridesmaids booked a room there and wanted the bridal party together. Don't waste your time or money here.

My husband is a Harrahs member so we come to Vegas once or twice a year and spend a couple thousand to play. We've stayed at almost every Harrahs hotel in Vegas; Caesars, Planet Hollywood, Paris, Bellagio, Harrahs, and Ballys. This was our first and last time at Flamingo! 
We walked out of barely functioning elevator, down a hall with mayo all over the carpet, into a musty, stale cigarette scented room with water rings on the ceiling, a broken light in the shower, a broken outlet, stained lampshades with cigarette holes, and large hooks where a missing picture once hung. I so regret not taking photos to share! 
We called guest services immediately to ask to switch rooms and she instructed us to take our belongings down to the front desk in order to move rooms. We hauled our luggage back to check in, only to be told they are sold out! The clerks solution was to send housekeeping to spray the room. The only thing worse then musty, smoke fumes, is PERFUMED musty, smoke fumes! 
I'm convinced the clerk, Jarrett, had the ability to put us in another room but chose not to. He never even looked on the computer to see what was available; just immediately said they were sold out. To the Asian man standing in the back with the suit on, behind the clerks, I didn't appreciate your smirk or your stares. Instead of finding our situation comical, you should've come over to help. 
We ended up calling Harrahs guest services and spoke to the Asst Mgr who, after much coordinating, found us another hotel. 
Thank goodness we were able to check out and go to Ballys. Since Yelp doesn't allow us to give zero or negative stars, the 1 star goes to Sammy who worked so hard to help us get another room. We have been faithful Harrahs players and seriously considered 'boycotting' all together after the initial disappointment but thank goodness Sammy was able to help us.

At the centrally located Flamingo I found a price of about $102\/night for a ""FAB Luxury strip view room"", so I booked it.  This would be our first stay at the Flamingo.  After booking the room, I accepted an email offer to upgrade our room (to a ""GO Luxury room"") for an additional charge.  Subsequently I received several text and email communications from ""The Flamingo staff"" solidifying all of the details (I had requested bottled water, soda, and extra pillows, and told them that it was my hubby's birthday).  I also received an email and texts from ""the Flamingo staff"" stating that we were confirmed for an ""upgraded GO Luxury room with a strip view"" and they had received my room requests, so I was looking forward to a great time.  
On arrival, I was told not only that no strip view rooms were available, but no ""upgraded rooms"" were available either.  We asked to speak to a manager, and she told us ""sorry but there are  no rooms with a strip view available at all"".  The manager had a really bad attitude and was rude.  I showed her the print-out that stated we were booked for a ""Luxury Strip view room"".  I also showed her all of the text messages that I had received confirming everything.  She then went in the back and returned, saying that she had found a room for us.  So I thought that everything would be fine.    
When we entered our room I was HORRIFIED.  The pungent odor of urine and mildew was overwhelming and actually made me nauseous.  Of course there were none of the items I had requested in the room.  The carpet was filthy and there were black marks all over the walls.  The TV was a 15"" flat panel sitting on top of an old filthy chest of drawers.  The TV remote was broken.  The bathroom was tiny (really tiny).  The floors were filthy and the fan had been ripped out with only wires hanging from the ceiling.  The tub and sink were dirty.  The lock on the safe was broken.  I have stayed in $40\/night Motel-6 rooms that were far superior.  I have never seen anything like this in my life.  I was so repulsed by the room that I told my husband I didn't care what it cost, I wasn't sleeping here.
So my husband went down to the front desk and advised them we were leaving.  Then another manager came out and said that he had an ""upgraded room"" that we could have and that he would waive the upgrade charge, but it was on the ""Pet Floor"".  By this time, it was so late (and since we were only booked for 2 nights) we decided to give it a try.  The new room was at least clean and didn't smell of urine.  The only thing this room had the other room did not was that it was clean, it had a larger TV (probably 32"") and a small empty mini-fridge.  (I don't know how they would consider this an ""Upgraded room"".  To think that people pay more for this is astounding to me.)  Rather than waste more time finding a room at another hotel, we decided to stay and make the best of the situation.
We will NEVER stay at the Flamingo again.  I am also considering notifying the health department because I can't believe that they were intending on renting that first room out to ANYONE.  It was utterly atrocious.",1,1,1

Below is my experience with Total Rewards Visa. After reading you can make up your own mind if the ""Reward"" is worth it. 
This summer in August we made a family trip to Las Vegas and stayed at the Flamingo. Upon arrival, I went to sign up for a players card and was surprised when they told me I was already in the system. I figured it was from my last summer trip and I had signed up for the Players card and just forgot.  They went ahead and printed a players card and asked if I would be interested in signing up for a Visa Total Rewards card. I think the pitch was that I would get two free buffets and automatic upgrade on my players card. All I had to do was place one charge on the card and the reward was mine. I fell for it and signed up. In order to activate the reward and get the buffet I charged the days monorail tickets to my new Rewards card. Card in wallet never to be used again during this trip. Buffet received and we enjoyed the rest of the week. 

Now it's November.  I keep getting this unknown caller on my cell at work that fails to leave any voice mail. This happens every day for a week and I'm getting pretty upset at this spam caller. Well the number ends up calling my phone after work hours while I'm at home and I pick up to find out what they want. They tell me they are a collection agency and I am past due and need to make a payment. I said you are mistaken I have never been past due. The reply was that they are from Total Reward Visa and I am late. It's at that moment I remember the Vegas Trip and signing up for the card. I also do not recall paying the $78 dollar monorail charge. I told the lady that I would have paid the bill if they would have sent me a statement. The small charge was not something I specifically remembered I owed. She relied that they have sent out three statements. She asked my address and I told her. She said that is not the address we have on file or the address we sent the statement. I gave her my previous two addresses which cover the last 11 years of my residence. Neither of those are the right address. I ask what is the address on my account and she replied ""I can't give you that information"". I responded I would call the card company directly and get this resolved. 

Next call was to the number on the back of the card that was hidden deep in my wallet. It's pretty much the same story. Been going to the wrong address and no return mail has been received. Alarm goes off that someone now has my account info from the missing statements. The customer support also says they can not give me the address that's on file but if I sign up to see online statements it will have the address. Sounds good so I tell the customer support that I need to close my account since my info is floating around. He agrees and takes of the $100 worth of finance charges from all the ""late"" fees and closes my account. I sign up for online access and pay the $79 dollars of original charges. When I look at the statement I see that the address they were going to was an address I did once have...15 years ago. Apparently I had gotten the players card on a long ago trip to vegas and not once during the sign up at the Flamingo was I asked to verify address on file. At least now we can close this case right?
WRONG!!!!   I see my credit current score on my Discover card which has always been over 800. Well all of a sudden this month it has dropped 100 points. I find out it's because of this fiasco with Total Rewards and they've filed unfavorable data with the credit bureau. I understand that being nearly 3 months late would justify a bad report but I still figured since it was a mixup in the Total Reward Visa system and the bill was paid they would work with me to get this resolved. My call to customer service was transferred to ""Gayle"" in dispute resolution. She listens to my story and confirmed everything with my account notes but then ultimately puts the blame on me. She is telling me there is nothing she can do and that I caused the ""double whammy"" on my credit score by not paying the bill and then closing my account.  This week I will be sending certified letters to both the credit bureau and Total Reward Visa to see if this can be fixed. Either way, this entire experience has not been worth the 2 ""free"" buffets.",4,2,0

The reason I chose Flamingo was because I stayed there back in 2009 but it was in a Go Room, and I had fond memories. I also chose Flamingo for the location in proximity to the race start line, monorail, and the price.

I arrived around 10 am on Saturday morning the day before the race but was told I couldn't check in early unless I wanted to pay extra. This was not my experience in the past and I stayed at Harrah's earlier in 2011 and I was given a room well in advance of normal check in time and without having to pay an extra fee. Each time I have visited Vegas, I was able to check in at various hotels I've stayed in much earlier than check in time (given room availability - always a yes) and without an extra fee. My plan was to check in, catch up on some sleep, and then go to the race expo. I understand they may not have had room availability at that time in the morning, but the extra fee was a turn off. I was told I could check back at 1pm and was given the floor number my room would be on. I opted to check my bags (tipped bell service to check my bag in) and enjoy Vegas and go to the expo earlier. The Sands Expo Center is at a walkable distance and leg sparing for race day (or night in this case). I returned around 4pm and was given my room key and finally made it to my room. I do love the bell service. After you check you bags, you are given the phone number to call from your room and your claim ticket number for bell service to deliver your bags to your room. The gentleman who brought my bags up was great. He oriented me to the floor (ice machine, elevators, vending, etc) and asked if I had any questions. (This is a good opportunity to tip for service.)

Beautiful big room and comfy King bed for a solo traveler but I did notice a big pink stain in the middle of the floor. I did not walk bare foot in this room. I kept my socks on and I had extra socks with me. I did go downstairs to the Go Sexy Shop (I highly recommend visiting - very fun shop and staff) and bought cute leopard print folding slippers to wear, too. Floor gave me the impression it wasn't clean, but it could be just because of the odd big pink stain on the floor. Who knows what that stain was??? On more positive points, all the basic amenities are there for your comfort including toiletries and plenty of towels. I loved the big picture window\/wall of windows and the view of the other hotels during the day and night. Very comfy sitting area between the bed and the window, obvious vacuum marks on furniture which is nice to see, floor was quiet for the most part, be sure to put in your ""Do Not Disturb"" sign in your door if you want to sleep in. You can find it in your bedside table and insert in key slot. I didn't have one in my room but I called down and one was placed in the key slot of my room soon after. I was doing a night race, so I wanted as much sleep as possible!

On one of the mornings I heard the bulldozers going around 7am - no joke, I looked at the clock. First I thought it was the flamingos squawking but it was the scraping of the bulldozers below working on the new location of the soon to open Carlos 'n Charlies from what I heard. :)

Overall, pretty good stay but could've been more comfortable. I definitely got what I paid for instead of getting more than expected for such a great rate. Oh well, I highly recommend you upgrade to a Go Room, it's more updated, comfortable, but not necessarily cleaner from the last time I stayed in a Go Room. Very nice, though. Access to the monorail is a real asset. Buy your ticket at the kiosk in the lobby or at the station entrance. You can also get a pass online to redeem at the counter. Be sure to buy a 24 hour pass even if you think you'll only use it once or twice. It will come in handy and save your legs - especially if sore after a race or a day of walking. Taking the monorail will take you to the back of the hotels, but you get to explore the shops in the areas and there are plenty of signs and people to direct you to the entrance\/The Strip.

Better yet, after the fiasco at the Rock 'n Roll event last year, stay within close walking distance to the start\/finish line. You'll be glad you don't have to be in traffic, deal with crowds or lines for a long period of time, or anything. Get into that ice bath asap! :) Whether you are in Vegas for a race, event, or just enjoyment, upgrade to a Go Room if you stay at the Flamingo.

I've stayed here a number of times since then, and while I can't give it a full bump-up to four stars, I can say it's definitely improved (if I could give it 3 1\/2 stars, I would).

The pros: With the addition of The Linq and the reworking of the surrounding area, the location of Flamingo went from very good to great. It's become easier than ever to make your way north up the Strip to The Quad, Harrah's, and points north (in fact, the Habitat Tower elevators are just down the hall from the exit to The Linq, which is insanely convenient). Meanwhile, the monorail station out back is very useful if you're looking to travel further north or south without all the foot traffic. Also, points for affordable gambling (there's usually a pretty wide assortment of $10 blackjack) and lodging (after taxes and resort fees, I paid $520 and change for five nights).

The cons: They mostly lie in the age of the property. Some of the rooms (namely in the Habitat Tower) could use slight upgrades, namely in bathrooms. I'm pretty tall and almost hit my head in the shower. Also, the buffet, which used to be one of the best in Las Vegas, has gotten much worse. We went for breakfast one day, and one could count the number of pieces of fresh fruit being served on one hand. Finally, the sports book is unremarkable and very smoky. We spent most of Sunday afternoon there watching the NCAA basketball tournament, and the set of clothes I wore that day smelled like cheap cigar smoke for the rest of the trip. Also, while the tellers taking bets were personable and did a great job, drink service to the sports book was VERY slow (I made the remark that they must be running the rum in from the Dominican; it sure seemed that way!).

Conclusion: The Flamingo is a fun, cheap, and convenient place to stay. You could do better if you're willing to spend more money, but it's a good bargain, you can't beat the location, and the casino is decent enough. However, steer clear of the buffet, and if you pop into the sports book to place bets, make sure it's a short visit.",3,0,0

Unfortunately once we checked in to the room the line was so long we decided to use their new automated system and the machine kept saying my Driver's license was expired! Even the attendant couldn't get it to work. Thankfully she took us to V.I.P.

Once we got into the room it looked good and intimate for my husband and I. Even an awesome view of the bird sanctuary, pool & High Roller. Then taking a closer look unfortunately the room was quite beat up! I took pictures of the bathroom that was the worst and falling apart. It didn't hinder our fun of our celebration just was disappointed because I know they have had nicer rooms in the past!

Room: My girl and I tried this ruse in order to try to get a free upgrade, since all the other yelpers raved about how eazy it was to get an upgrade.  WRONG: moded. We got shafted with a regular room. Room had a couple of dirty towels, but we tossed them to the side. After our room was cleaned, we found a cup of water that the cleaner left behind. Walls are thin, you can hear the vacuuming in the morning, you can also hear ppl doing things at night, too. ;) Nice views from any room in the hotel. 

Casino: It's crackin 24\/7! Some other casino's seem tame at night, but the Flamingo always has ppl roaming around waiting to lose their last month's salary. I didn't know how to play card games, so I stuck to slots.  On my last nite there, I went up to one of those tables with the signs that said ""Ask me how to play"". Even though it was 1am, the guy was very polite and helpful. 

Pool: The pool was more of a human-stew. 4-ft deep water, no more. I guess I shouldn't expect much since it's just for ppl to lounge. The slide was crackin, tho! Screw the GO pool with the topless girls. I'd rather save my 10 buxxx and get my jollys from the kiddie slide.

Room service: How delicious! We got omelets, yogurt, apple juice, Philly Cheese steak, and sliced bananas. Everything was delicious and very nicely prepared. You know what they say, the eyes eat first. (The sliced bananas didn't seem caramelized tho, but maybe it was cause it was 2am when we ordered them.)

Classic hotel with modern renovations.

The rooms are large (we stayed in a Mini GO Suite) but the TVs were so annoying because the one remote that operated both rarely operated the one TV you were attempting to operate as it would also operate the other. If you weren't careful you would end up turning both at the same time and the tv closest to the bed was programmed to turn on at a very loud volume, it was deafening and irritating. Even more annoying was the VERY limited availability of mirrors in the room. Never before have I appreciated access to a mirror while getting dressed. But considering that this was my wedding, I wanted AND NEEDED to see myself in my dress. The one and only full size mirror in the whole room was in the narrow entryway. The only way to see yourself was to stand right up against the mirror in the narrow 3 ft hallway. I got so claustrophobic in that small area and it was practically impossible when I had on my wedding dress. Besides, it was pointless because there was limited lighting and because I had to stand so close to the mirror that I couldn't get a good look, that is, if I was able to see through the fog that appeared on the mirror from breathing within the close proximity. The lack of mirror access would be annoying in general, but for dressing for my wedding, I would have stayed somewhere else had I known in advance. After many calls to the front desk and several broken promises by the Flamingo staff to return our calls, a full-size mirror was eventually brought to our room. They made it very clear that we could only have the mirror in our room temporarily and that they'd be back to pick it up later that afternoon. Wow, they sure know how to make a girl feel special on her wedding day.... And sure enough, they quickly retrieved the mirror as they were concerned that it posed a liability since it was not secured and just leaning on the wall. I am pretty sure that they only brought it up because they picked up on the possible liability [to them and\/or the room] I was on the verge of becoming if I did not get a mirror. I was close to becoming full blown bridezilla and pull the hall mirror off the wall and move it to area of the room where I could actually use it. I wanted a mirror and I was not going to give up. And the Flamingo staff sure made it hard to get it done. Everyone was quick to supply ""congratulations"" in an area where weddings occur on a daily basis, but I was surprised that the Flamingo did absolutely nothing for us on our wedding day. The fact that we were getting married on-site was noted at the time of booking and we used their outside chapel for the ceremony. There was no card or small amenity to welcome, congratulate, or anything to remotely make us feel special or to show appreciation for choosing them for our special day. What we did get from the Flamingo staff was the runaround and utter frustration from having to work so hard just to get a mirror.",0,0,0

Two nights and three days, and since I stayed during the week, I had the pleasant surprise of having my room upgraded free of charge. Still the best bang for your buck. Right in the middle of the strip, lots of great food nearby, and all the necessary amenities in your room all the time, your own fridge is always the item that most do not give you.

I had a small issue with them, but it was quickly resolved by their attentiveness to be their for the customer. I had a letter on the counter the second day saying that their computer systems were going to be updated during the time I was checking out, so they would charge me the night before i left so that it would not interfere with my payment. That was all fine, but when I went to do the express check out on the television the next morning their system was down so I had to go to the lobby and wait in a long line. Fortunately for the step ahead thinking of this hotel they had a sharply dressed employee walking through the line asking for those who were checking out. He had an iPad where i entered my room number and last name and that was it, checked out. Great job thinking of the possible issues the customers might experience with the system issues.

Once again they did a great job looking out for their customers and making my trip amazing. The Flamingo will have my business for as long as they continue giving me such great reasons to stay there.",1,0,1

I stayed 2 nights (monday, and tuesday) and got a GO Deluxe room for $35 a night which I thought was pretty awesome. And they gave us a coupon book with lots of good deals. 

The room was a wonderful 65 degrees all the time, had a tv in the bathroom mirror so you could soak in the tub and watch tv at the same time. Funky cool pink paint and lights in the bathroom also. Nice view of the pool, curtains were opened and closed automatically with a switch on the wall. The room was very clean, big and fresh. 

The flamingo is in a great spot on the strip making it easy to see lots of stuff.

 I only went in the 21+ pool area it was busy but fun, and very large. The drinks were expensive to me, bout $15 for a margarita but I swear that was the best freakin margarita I've ever had in my life!!

I signed up for the Total Rewards card and that was cool because I got discounts in the shops, restaurants, AND got to go in a separate line for check-in so I didn't have to wait like everybody else =D Its free to sign up and well worth it

Third day of the trip I tried out the buffet there, the Paradise Garden Buffet. It was not crazy big, but it had a good selection. I went for lunch and there was a taco area, pizza, fried chicken, salad bar, shrimp, orange chicken, chocolate fountain, a woman making fresh crepes etc. Used one of the coupons from the book we received at check-in, plus my total rewards card, and ended up paying $27 for 2 people lunch buffet (soft drinks included). Plus they were advertising all you can drink beer\/wine for an extra $10 bucks if you are into that.

The casino dealers were very nice and explained the rules and walked me through the games being a 1st time gambler. 

Hotel was very clean from rooms to lobby, pool etc, there are always people around cleaning.

I only have 2 complaints: 

1. the morning we were checking out, check out is at 11am. I went to take a shower at 10am and there was no hot water. The past couple days I took a few showers there were no issues so I'm not sure what happened, but I didn't make a big deal we were leaving anyhow.

2. the restaurant Carlos and Charlies--Terrible, don't go there. Its inside the Flamingo, and although the decor is nice the food is substandard and pricey. Chips and Salsa is not free if you want it its an appetizer. I got a burrito which is $15 (who the heck charges that much for a freakin burrito?!?!) and it was not good at all. Green sauce was way to spicy, chicken tasted like it was from mcdonalds. Chipolte is higher class and better quality

      We mostly played cards in the Poker Room and had a great time. Dealers were nice and servers were very attentive---my fav dealer was Patty(looked a bit like Liza Minelli, but much prettier), and my fav server was Iris(wowwwww).

I wasn't expecting the Bellagio, but with the description of the newly refurbished rooms, I was expecting something a little more than what we were staying in. 

Taxis are so ridiculous to catch! We waited probably 20 minutes for a taxi.

Getting carded every 10 minutes. At no other casino did I have to show my ID so much. I'm 5 months from 30 and married, plus I was constantly carrying a beer around, do I really have to show my ID every time I sit down? I should take it as a compliment I guess. My husband got carded, though not as much, and this was AFTER he showed his players card. I'm not sure how many minors have such a high status, but it got a little out of hand.  

The mattress is the MOST uncomfortable mattress I have ever slept on. Oh my gosh, I can't believe I have to lay on it for two more nights. Plus, the pillows that come standard on the bed are cheap polyester filling. I have never stayed at a hotel that doesn't offer feather down pillows automatically. We had to call down and ask for feather pillows, which we were told were on the bed. ""Ok, awesome, but they're not."" 

The air conditioner does not get cold. I woke up several times in the night sweating. We set it on 65 and it has yet to drop below 74 the whole time. 

The line for checking in was CRAZY long. Thankfully, my husband's status with the hotel got us to the front of the line, and we were in and out super fast.

The people selling shows in the casino are extremely pushy, and everywhere. Give me a break, we just got off a 12 hour stint in the airport, I'm pushing luggage through the lobby, get the hell out of my face.

Ok, now the good points about this hotel:

Staff on the casino floor is very nice and friendly, granted they are working on tips also, but they will explain things and were very kind. 

Drinks came to us pretty quick.

The room was pretty enough. And the housekeeping staff did a great job of making our beds and keeping it clean.

Fantastic location. No, seriously. FAN- freaking- tastic location. We have stayed up and down and in the middle of the strip, and this part of the strip is always the best.

Room service needs were quick.

The energy in the casino is fun!!!

Our rooms are always comped.

I looked directly across from Ceasers and could see Bellagio as well. I was on the 26th floor and sat in the chaise every night before bed to look at the fabulous strip. The room itself was just ok. Cleanliness, especially the bathroom is questionable. The bed was very very comfortable though. I didn't win in the casino here, although I never do. I Ioved the pool area. I didn't eat here, so I can't comment on that. I was slightly annoyed by the time share people right when you get off or on the elevator, but I learned to just keep walking. Overall the stay was fine, no problems, and if it's comped I'd stay here again. Perfect location on the strip!!",0,0,0

Hotel Review:

Overall sucked.  I don't know how else to say it.  I remember getting a ""Go"" room years back and it was swanky and fun, really Vegas-like.  We booked a ""Go"" room and drove over for a couple nights.  We also paid more for a ""high roller view"".  First annoyance was the check-in process.  There wasn't maybe 3 couples in front of us and it still took forever.  I could've Netflix'd half a TV show during the wait.  When we eventually got up to our ""high roller view"", even after asking the check-in guy about the view and being told it was great, it was terrible.  I kid you not we opened the drapes to a view of an adjacent window.  So, we called down and told them not only did the view stink, two lights were out and there was someone else's beer cap on the floor.  So, they had one ""strip view"" left but we had to go back downstairs to the line to get new keys.  I thought maybe they'd have someone meet us like at other places but that didn't happen.  

Okay, it's Las Vegas.  Most people party, yeah?  Or at least do something to wake up with a headache.  Nothing like popping an Advil and then stepping into a COLD SHOWER.  I turned it on and waited, and waited, and waited and the water was puke-warm at best.  That on top of no water pressure I was really disappointed.  Called down to guest services and the lady made it sound like there had been a water problem but that it was now fixed.  She said they'd send an engineer up.  Not sure if this engineer ever came because we went out on the town but that night and the next day it was still warm, and I say that generously.  Not a good idea in any hotel, let alone a place like Vegas where you need some morning sin bathing.  

The casino was fun.  Definitely old and smokey compared to some but I like the history part of the Flamingo and LOVE the Margaritaville casino, although it blows my mind how much some of the employees complain about having to listen to 8 hours of Jimmy Buffett music...sign me up! 

Overall the machines were tight.  But playing slots in Vegas isn't the wisest move in the world either.  Tables were fun, ambiance was fun and the all night dining downstairs was a life saver.  

Overall an okay stay.  The hotel was definitely a disappointment and from reading some other reviews, they should probably figure out the hot water problem because it's enough to get people to stay elsewhere.",1,0,0

They apologized for the nasty room and offered to have someone clean it. We said yes please have someone do that. After being gone all day, we arrived back at our room and it hadn't even been cleaned. Lord...just get me out of this shithole is all I can think at this point. When we checked out I wasn't even going to complain, but my boyfriend insisted. A nice older gentleman (of course I can't remember his name) waived the resort fee for our 2 night stay. It was a nice gesture, but next time I'll spend a little more and get a little more. Remember....you get what you pay for.

Flamingo is clean, neat, with simple and modern room decor -- great for travelers on a budget. The service reps were well-intentioned, but this hotel was completely understaffed and ultimately did not deliver on a good experience. 

When we got to the front desk at 1am on a Thursday night, we were shocked by the size of the line -- probably about 40 people long. Even worse, it took us an HOUR to get served. I want to say the line moved at the speed of molasses, but that's giving it too much credit. Molasses moves at 100 times the speed of that line. 

After we finally reached the front of the line, our front desk assistant (I think his name was Ty) was efficient and helpful. He got us out of there in about 5 minutes, helping my group with both of our reservations and getting us rooms in the same tower. 

Since our stay in the hotel was only one night, I don't have too much to complain about. I called asking for a toothbrush twice. The first time, they sent us towels instead. The second time, no one even came. Eventually, we just gave up and went to sleep. In the boys' room, they complained that the shower was significantly lacking in water pressure. Fortunately, we stayed at the Monte Carlo for the rest of the weekend, and our experience with them was much better.

In the end, I'm just confused on why there were only 3 assistants serving along the front desk, which clearly had about 10 spaces available. Flamingo simply needs to hire some more people for the front desk and for guest services. The current staff is nice and friendly, but there clearly weren't enough people working to serve such a huge number of customers.",6,4,0

When I stayed here, they turned off the water in the hotel - not even the toilets worked.  They informed me when I called down to the front desk and waited 25 minutes on the phone, that I could go to the casino floor and use the restroom there.  What did I pay for?  The room had half of the floor in carpet and the rest was concrete where they had pulled up whatever was on the floor before.  The bathroom had wallpaper hanging off of the walls as if it had been steamed off.  The shower was covered with mold around the enclosure.  Needless to say, we didn't  stay there and went to another facility.  When I returned the next day to cancel and receive a refund, the rudeness at the front desk was the worst I'd ever received.  Since I didn't give them enough notice, they were going to charge me for my full stay even though I wasn't staying there.  After escalating my complaint through management, I got my refund, but I made sure that all the people now waiting in line would know that service to them would not be acceptable.

I was so sick to my stomach and I called the front desk immediately. Management switched us right over to their Neapolitan Suite at no additional charge. They also brought the room key down to us since they had a very busy check in during that time. Although I appreciated them accommodating us right away I am still not over this.

The location is close to everything I enjoy most about Vegas. We did a cabana at the pool. This pool is vibrant, and more my speed as opposed to some of the other pool parties available in Vegas. The servers are all friendly. The music is good. One thing that does SUCK is the restrooms. There's even a line for mens (unheard of). I understand its by the pool, but I hated going to the restroom because you always feel like you're standing in a lake. The pool party itself was pretty good. I had a blast. Despite the many options available in Vegas, I always end up just going to the Flamingo.

The room (Go Room). Check the website for a hotel description. My thoughts: Fairly clean. A deep cleaning of the carpets in the room (and hallways for that matter) wouldn't hurt. The TV programming sucks. Obviously I didn't come to Vegas to watch TV, but even while in the room (in between outings) the channel lineup makes no sense. Also, I don't think they've ever had cords to plug in your Iphone for music. Knowing this, I brought my own speaker. The fridge (not available in the fab rooms) is clutch if you plan on bringing your own libations, and\/or taking back leftovers for future consumption.

The driveway to get into the hotel parking is kind of dumb - you're fighting the foot traffic between the Flamingo and Bill's so we waited for what seemed like forever before flooring it and almost knocking some people out the way. Once at the parking structure we almost weren't allowed in because we didn't have a room key because we hadn't yet checked in, but seeing all our luggage in the backseat was sufficient enough, thank goodness. We had booked a Go Room with two queen beds for myself, my husband and a friend. Check-in was slooooww with only one line for people checking in and out. The woman who was supposed to be checking us in was RUDE. Her name started with an ""M"" and she had black hair.. just try not to end up at her window if you can help it because she gave us the hardest time.  

Finally we got into our rooms. After waiting 30 minutes for the bellboy to bring up our things, we called down to see what the holdup was. ""10 more minutes, there's one more guest ahead of you,"" we were told. 30 more minutes and another phone call later our bags arrived. That put a small damper on our eagerness to start partying right away but we got over that quickly. Our room had the most amazing view of the Strip and the Bellagio fountains. With small mirrored panels above each bed complete with those naked Hollywood bulbs surrounded by an all-white bed frame and headboard, the room had a bit of a retro-futuristic feel. The bathroom was cool with a sliding frosted door and a TV inside the mirror. 

The pool party on Saturday morning was just as we expected it to be - an overly warm pool overflowing with drunken 20 somethings. The vibe was energetic and fun, and the grotto area with the waterfalls was really fun. There was also a booty shaking contest which really got everyone riled up... I see a Vegas baby boom from that weekend in the near future. 

The WiFi here sucks. The hallways trip me out - I don't know if it's the colors of the huge number of rooms stretching endlessly, but when you're intoxicated beware! It could be hard to find your room.. personal experience.The lobby and casino were constantly bustling - quick tip: buy your bottles of water and other drinks elsewhere because the beverage shop inside the casino on your way out to the Strip charges about $4.50 for a bottle of water. Although desperate times call for desperate measures.

Hate the lobby format, and the way the casino is situated, it seems to draw the smoke smell in, and it just lingers, I have a hard time breathing in that, and it almost killed me every time I would walk down to try to exit the building.  I didnt even walk thru the casino part, but felt like I had smoked a pack of cigs.",0,0,0

     The accomodations are a-ok and what I expected.  5-star?  No.  4-star?  It begins to touch the basement of a 4-star.  My personal opinion is Flamingo is a satisfactory 3 to 3.5-star stay.  The pool is just adequate.  The casino is large and has some ""Whale Areas"" for the high-rollers.  I didn't view Flamingo as a true Vegas-style nightlife stop as is Caesars or Bellagio or Arias and the likes.
     Flamingo gets it done with common fanfare, good food and buffet offerings.  The room are basic in my range of stays.  I wish it has a 24-hour food shop in which to quench the thirst or grab a snack or something hot.
    Location?  It's perfect.  You can stay for less at the Flamingo - not be disappointed - and have access to all that is diamonds, gold, platinum and the likes to your north, south,east and west.",2,0,0

What is the point of reserving a room if they are going to give away our room to someone else? Doesn't it make sense to reserve the non-smoking room for the people who booked and pre-paid for the thereby requested room? We were told that because we arrived late, all the other rooms were taken.

Check in:
We arrived at 2:30pm on a Friday afternoon and waited maybe 15 minutes to check in (our choice not to use self check in - it was offered to us by an actual human - and a very polite human I might add).  Shari at the front desk was absolutely amazing.  Super friendly, great energy and very helpful.  Steered us from our studio room into a Go room because of the age of the furnishings - but she only did this after asking us a series of questions and showing us pictures of rooms.  No pressure was applied for us to change rooms and there was an extremely nominal difference in price so we decided to change to the Go room.  Our keys were created and we were sent on our way - no early check in fee, no hassle.  In our room before 2:50pm....

Elevators:
We were on the 21st floor in the spa tower and never had a long wait or an issue with the elevators.  True that only 3 of the 6 elevators were operable in the bank, but they seemed to run smoothly all weekend.  Our friends were staying in the main tower and each night that we visited them, we had short wait times for elevators in their banks as well.

Go Room:
Newer furniture, a small fridge, great view of the Bellagio fountains and quiet.  No real complaints at all.  Blankets and pillows were clean, plenty of towels, and a nicely appointed bathroom.  Two TVs.  Housekeeping was lovely and very friendly.  I also saw management on the floor and he was polite and smiling.  Yes, the hallways could use come updating (shampoo the carpet and paint the doors, but really not a big deal.  Just looks a bit unkempt.  Not disastrous or offputting.

Pool:
Two pools - one family, one 21+.  We had a cabana at the family pool.  Plenty of space, decent towel service.  Not enough servers\/hosts - there were only two people working for the entire pool.  They were clearly understaffed but truly, the pool area had a bar that never had a line so you could easily go and get your own water (free) and order other drinks from a bartender. Food needed to be ordered from one of the two working on the deck.  No cover charge, not a lot of kids, decent music (not fabulous, just decent).

Casino:
Meh.  Needs some glam to bring this back to its heyday but you can always swing next door to another casino for more ambiance.  Regardless, it's a casino.  Has all of the games you'll need.  Enough said.

Checkout:
Online, you can set your own time and an email pops up with a receipt.  Easy peasy.

Overall, it was a very nice stay.  I usually stay at other Caesars properties but wanted to stay at the same hotel as all of my friends (there were 20 of us for a party).  I was pleasantly surprised.  Bottom line, be nice when you check in and you will be rewarded with a nice room and probably have a great time here.  You reap what you sow.

Sure, the rooms aren't the best (often the interior, beds, bathroom, etc... is lacking or dated) but you don't know how good you have something until you don't have it anymore. The Flamingo is in one of the best locations on the strip. It is connected to the monorail, right across the street from Caesar's Palace and Bellagio, and gives you access to a lot of convenience stores\/amenities located on the same part of the sidewalk. (Walgreens, Dennys, McDonalds, the list goes on).

It's just in a fantastic location. If you really want to enjoy ""being on the Vegas strip"", then Flamingo is a great spot to do it. Don't forget - there is an independent (not a hotel lobby one with absurd prices) liquor store literally a 3 minute walk from the location. Try finding that at the Mirage.

Not to mention the Flamingo is an iconic hotel from famous movies like Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas. And don't forget the pool. It's quite literally one of the best in the area.

Definitely room for improvement in some departments but it's a fantastic hotel and one of the best in the area that easily enables you to experience Vegas.",1,1,0

I was looking for somewhere new to stay this time, and I figured: (1) the Flamingo is centrally located on the Strip, (2) there's a monorail stop in the back of the property, (3) my mom likes flamingos, (4) the rates were around $40\/night, and (5) the reviews weren't all negative... so how bad could it be?

I reserved a non-smoking room with two double beds.  In true Vegas style, they ""ran out of non-smoking rooms"" and wanted to put me in a smoking room.  I'd slipped a twenty in between my ID and credit card when I was checking in, which is a trick that usually gets you something nice - and this time, it saved me from a smoking room.  Alas, it didn't save me from the ensuing nightmare.  I was assigned a mini-suite on a high floor.  Superficially, it's a nice room.  Much bigger than a standard room, with a decent view of the Flamingo's famous nature habitat and pool facilities.  The decor is somewhat modernized, though a little bland.  But when you looked a little closer, the room left a lot to be desired:  Weird spatters and dents on the walls.  Stains on the ceiling.  Mildewed grout.  Shower curtain torn in half.  Sink that takes 5 minutes to drain.  No washcloths, bathmat, soap dish, or tub stopper.  Broken light fixture.  Outlet missing its cover.  General grunginess. 

The next morning, I called ""guest services"" (which took a while, since the button for ""guest services"" on my phone was - yes - broken!) and they said someone would come up during the day and fix everything.  I left and came back.  Half of the problems were still there, and I had new ones - they'd left filthy plunger-water in my sink, taken one of my rolls of toilet paper, and left a note advising that the hotel was out of toilet paper!  I was irate.  I went down to the desk this time and spoke to a manager on-duty.  He said they couldn't change my room because the hotel was full (meanwhile, they had rooms available for booking on their website), but they could fix everything in the evening.  Okay.  I left and came back around midnight.  Still not all fixed!  I did have toilet paper now (whew) but called maintenance once again.  They came around 1:30AM and finished my repairs.  I got an offer to change rooms for my last night, but I didn't want to repeat the process now that I'd been through all of this ridiculous nonsense.

I suppose you get what you pay for, though that doesn't quite ring true when my horrible $40\/night room has a regular rate of several times more.  I doubt they came in and made it worse because I paid less.  I took photographs of all of the broken stuff and am writing a letter to the Flamingo management about their crappy old hotel.",4,0,1

I visit Las Vegas once a year & I thought it would be fun to experience the strip with a bit of vintage flair~ boy, was I wrong! 

On the day of my visit I confirmed my reservation via an automated email that had been emailed to me. This confirmation offered a reservation number. 

Upon arrival and eight hours of travel I visited a self-serve kiosk. It was shared with me ""My room was not ready"". I waited thirty minutes in the check in line. The guests in line had a college spring break vibe. Coolers in tow & cases of beer. People sitting on the ground all over the lobby.

I explained my concerns to a very nice front desk attendant & she gave me a very nice view on the strip. I was also the first door off the elevator. I was extremely thrilled to have that view. 

The downside. Upon entering the room I noticed a puddle of water. The air condition is in the ceiling & it dripped constantly. I was in the older tower as the cost to upgrade to the other tower was an additional $30 per evening. My stay was complimentary so I was only responsible for the $30ish ""resort fee"" imposed by hotel. The furnishing felt like those in an off-freeway motel. They were worn, beaten & old. The lamp on the side table does not have a plug so you must move the nightstand to retrieve a plethora of wires leading to the power strip. I've never seen a power strip in a hotel room. I just wanted to charge my cell phone. On day three I went to work at 7am & returned around 10pm to a room that had not been cleaned or attended to. This was frustrating as I had a long work day & didn't expect this upon return.

The next day I realized I did not have a bath mat as the maid must have taken it. I spent the next few days using an oversized towel as a bath mat.

The elevators seem to be a topic on Yelp. While I recall waiting some time for the elevator it's strange to note that nobody ever seemed to be in them. Perhaps I have strange hours? 

On the final day of my stay I attempted to check out online & was given an error message. I attempted to check out on the television & was given an error message as well. I had to call to check out as I wanted to ensure the $250 deposit was returned.  The Flamingo just missed the mark each & every time.",5,1,0

First of all, I arrived in Las Vegas very early (8am) and check in was at 4pm. I wanted to take a nap. I ended up upgrading my room ($25\/night extra) Bc I wanted to lay down. The smell..... I'm going to describe this as heavy perfume trying to cover up cigarette smoke and sex smells. It is disgusting. If u have a sensitive nose, you will hate this place. There was no bar soap in the bathroom. Then the sink clogged up and the water would not drain. And I noticed that the bathroom door is a sliding glass opaque door. My advice..... if this is a boyfriend\/girlfriend trip and it's a new relationship, the sliding glass door provides no privacy. So if u have to do dirty business, he will hear u and smell u!!! You're welcome. 

The design of this place with all of this pink and white, looks like a Victoria secret store in 1992. And the smell is stronger than Abercrombie and fitch but not as pleasant. 

My shower had luke warm water. I don't know if that was Bc I was on the 27th floor or BC this hotel  was built in the 1950's. 

There's a large mirror in the room but no plugs next to it so that I can get ready and curl\/ straighten\/ or blow dry my hair. Design flaw!! 

As far as wifi, they only allow 2 devices to be connected to the wifi.  Notice I said 2 devices and not phones. So if someone signed on to the laptop, that means one other phone or computer can sign on now. We tried to use the wifi when we got into the room, it was down for a few hours. 

I'm going to save money and go to Walgreens\/ CVS and stock up on water and snacks. The prices for water here is RIDICULOUS. $6 for a bottle of water. 

I regret booking at this hotel since this is my first time in Las Vegas. Next time I'll do more research and read yelp reviews. If I were to come back here I would consider staying at the newer hotels like Aria, Cosmopolitan, Palazzo. 

Since this was my first time in Las Vegas, I learned that some hotels have a separate area for uber and Lyft than taxi.  This hotel has a sign on the wall outside for uber and Lyft. I found this info out on my last day here :(

This definitely wasn't a super fancy shmancy hotel but it suited our needs! It had TVs in the mirrors which was ultra schway and my usually aching back loooved the beds. The rooms were stylish and cute too.

The pools were fun and definitely where the party was at. My friends and I entered the limbo contest, kayaking contest AND booty-shaking contest. It was a lot of fun. My only complaint is that the pools closed at like 6-8. With our busy schedule we wanted some night-swimming. Oh, and they didn't allow you to bring your own food or beverages into the pool area. 

There were lots of food options down below. For breakfast we had a pizza and beer combo at the pizza place below. Nom!",0,1,0

The Good:
1. The newly refreshed rooms are very nice. Bamboo flooring, flat screen televisions, hip decor.
2. Location. Absolutely in the middle of everything. Reason alone to stay here.
3. View. If your room faces out onto the strip, it's incredible
4. Pool is huge. In summer its a mad house of 20-ish partiers. Fun. 

The Bad:
1. Some parts are just so rundown. My first elevator had half the buttons missing. Instead of replacing them, they wrote them in with a Sharpie.
2. Resort Fee. For $20 you get to use the pool, a small rundown fitness center (but not the steamrooms, sauna, or spa) and Internet. All this should be included in the price.
3. Penguin exhibit is long gone.
4. Sheets are scratchy. This is no Westin
5. Bathroom are old and tired. Water coming out of tap smells like feces.

Bottom Line:
In spite of its shortcomings, it's still a heck of a value in Las Vegas. It's just with all these new and beautiful hotels being built you can really see the shabby-ness of the Flamingo. They must still be making a fortune or they would have demolished it years ago and built a new Flamimgo. The property is huge. But you can only put so many coats of lipstick on a pig.",3,0,0

I arrived on April 1 and checked in around 6p only to find my room is a completely mess.  Beds are not made, and no clean towels at the bathroom.  I called the front desk that I'd like to switch room, but I was told there was no available rooms at the time.  Front desk said they will send someone up right away to make the room and provide clean towels.  My bf and I waited for an hour before someone finally showed up to clean the room.  We missed half of our show because we couldn't shower and get dressed right away.

I talked to someone at the front desk and expressed my concern and disappointment, and I was offered a refund  for the first night which I never reveived.  When I called back again a month later, no one seems to remember this and there was no ""notes"" or anything that Flamingo supposed to refund me the first night to compensate the trouble I had to go through.  

I also contacted my credit card company and only to find that Flamingo refused to refund me because I ""stayed"" in the room ""that night""  As far as I'm concern, the refund was supposed to compensate me for missing half of the show and the hassle I had to go through with your hotel.

Pluses:
- Affordable nightly rates
- Easy check in\/out - can do it all without talking to a human!
- Hertz rental car within the lobby, and can pick up a car at the hotel
- AWESOME pool area. We were here in winter, but it looked really neat. Also, they have a little bird sanctuary with actual flamingos, ducks, swans, and other exotic waterfowl. 
- FANTASTIC location. Easy to walk to just about anything near central strip, and attached to the monorail! Cool restaurant\/shopping area in between Flamingo and the Linq next door, as well as proximity to the High Roller. 
- Cool history. One of the oldest on the strip, and still has that 'old Vegas' feel with the neon lights and old bulbs in the fixtures. 

Negatives:
- Loud, smoky casino. Ambiance at this casino is not as desirable, and also seemed really crowded in the evenings. Attached to Margaritaville, which was both a positive and a negative.
- Rooms are totally blah. Amenities are lacking. Our beds were comfy and clean, but our tub faucet kept slowly dripping out all of our hot water.

Mind you, the Flamingo is not the newest hotel, or the nicest. And I've heard that some people have had some bad experiences there, although mine have always been pretty good. So what does the Flamingo have going for it? One word: Convenience.

I've stayed in hotels where you have to walk 20 minutes through the casino to see sunlight and breathe fresh air (ahem, MGM Grand). In Flamingo, I can go from my room and onto the Strip in under five minutes if the elevators work in my favor. This is huge to me.

There are also a lot of convenient options for eating, drinking, and cheap gambling. Of course, you're doing these things in places like O'Sheas and Bill's, so you have to expect that you're not exactly going to be hob-nobbing with the visiting celebrities. But if you want to high-roll, you can cross the street to Bellagio, Caesars, or Cosmopolitan with little trouble.

If you're the type of person who comes to Vegas and doesn't plan to spend much time in your room, Flamingo is the place for you. They also have a great pool with outdoor blackjack and craps - low limit! (Or at least they were when I was there in July mid-week.)",5,1,1

I had read reviews from other fellow Yelpers that all pretty much agreed to get a ""GO ROOM"" but I am stubborn and thought what the heck I will just keep my deluxe room. 

WELL..............we first check in after getting attacked by the timeshare people who can't seem to take ""NO"" for an answer. Anyway I digress. 

So we get our room and the lady tells us she has a room available but it is far from the elevator and we will have to walk a little. So my husband and I are in pretty good shape so we say no problem and get the room. We walked prob 5-8 minutes to get to the room. We open the door and turn on the lights and the carpet looked like it had not been cleaned in YEARS! Then I check the bedding for ""bed bugs"" and I don't find any but I do find a half pint of whiskey someone. This might of made some happy but not me. We left our room right after that and when down to the lobby and requested that we be upgraded to a Go Room. The lady tells us they are booked and it's a busy weekend being Superbowl and UFC. I tell her I know they have to have a Go room available. After having a stare off she tells me that there is a GO room available. We were not able to get the room free but she did give us the discounted rate so it was like $25 a night. 

We get to the GO room and things are much, much better! Very happy and the room is great just like all the fellow Yelpers had indicated. We had a great view and the beds were so soft. We will def go back to the flamingo just for the Go rooms. It was in a great location and we had a great time. 

I am giving the Flamingo a 4 star just for the go rooms and did I mention there were go-go dancers at night?",0,0,0

Pros:
-Center strip so very easy to walk anywhere you desire.
-Front desk was very helpful! We had a partial payment in cash and wanted to upgrade from a Fab room to a Go room, and the woman at the front desk was incredibly friendly and helpful. 
-Room service did a good job at cleaning our room every day and providing fresh clean sheets and towels.
-Bed was super comfortable
-The cafe's downstairs were very tasty
-cheaper than most hotels on the strip
-Go rooms have coffee makers and refrigerators for storing leftovers
-Very easy to store luggage with bell desk + they have lockers for storing laptops before check in\/check out.
-Real flamingos!!!
-Our bathtub was huge and perfect for soaking after walking for 4 hours everyday.
-We had plenty of hot water, unlike a lot of the reviews for the hotel??

Cons:
-check in took FOREVER. Probably 30-45 minutes waiting in line, I would recommend the express check in if you can.
-Walls are THIN. We could hear the people next door having a good time and later snoring. Bring earplugs if you're a super light sleeper!!!
-Water pressure was horrible. Took probably 15-20 minutes just to fill our bath tub.
-Check out took forever since the express check out machine didn't work for us.
-Buffet is horrible
-Minor damage on the furniture and wallpaper, but this is purely aesthetic.
-WiFi costs extra


**Some of the reviewers on here complain about the timeshare people.. just walk on past them. Yes, they suck, but you are 0 percent obligated to talk to them at all. Be a little bit brave (or rude) and just walk right by them, or just politely say ""We're not interested, thank you"" and keep walking. It's not hard, I promise!

Fact of the matter, you're staying at an old hotel. Don't complain about the wallpaper in the halls not being spotless since this hotel has been around for quite some time. The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable, and that's really all you need when you're in Vegas, right?",6,0,0

When I go to a hotel I expect a bit of comfort in the room. The phone's socket was hanging out of the wall. I had to plug in the clock and set the time myself. There was a hole in the wall where the door handle had collided with it once too often. The TV was an old-fashioned CRT and not a flat panel. I had an ant infestation, they were all over the bedside table and floor. To compensate they couldn't knock anything off the room rate because of the way I'd paid (Expedia) but they gave me a free breakfast at the buffet. 

Speaking of breakfast, the lines at all the eating establishments were a mile long in the morning.  I had a wedding to get to and I was not expecting to have to wait in line for breakfast, so I had to get some yoghurt parfait and a croissant at one of the little stalls and eat it in my ant-infested room.

Use to be the best pool on the strip and that's the only reason I stayed there for years since the rooms are crummy.  I didn't use to mind the outside fascade looking war torn with big chips out of the building, oldest & longest wait elevators in town and everyhing in the casino needs a face lift big time.

Now they've even ruined that!!!  

We had to stand in a line 20 minutes to get into the adult pool to be told we needed our IDs.  No one told us that so we had to go all the way back to the room to get them.  Not a hotel key, nope, ID's.  Other people in line had same complaint after getting to the front of the line, why not tell people this!!!???

Oh and now everyone is allowied in even if not staying at the hotel so it's an over populated ZOO with too loud of music.  Couldn't even relax!  This pool closes at 6pm!!!

The other pool doesn't need ID's only your room key, but closes at 5pm!!!!

Oh and don't take anything into it even your own water as they'll have you dump it and no food can be brought in either.

The pool areas are not serviced at all.  We never had a waitress the whole 2 days we spent at the pool even though we saw them walking around here and there.  And, spewed with empty bottles and cups every where so that wasn't really being serviced either.  Expensive drinks at the pool too, over the top expensive.

Our room was nice, they've face lifted those, but the bathroom old school big time.  The bathroom vent had so much caked dust and grime it was gross not to mentioned the bubbled ceiling that looked like the floor above was leaking ready to burst into our bathroom! Our view HA what view, was a ladder, trash and the next building 3 feet away.  

Every time, and I mean EVERY TIME, you walk to the pool, out of the elevators to the casino or out the side door you will be accosted by sales people trying to ""give"" you free show tickets to the point you want to scream at them, ""Leave me freaking alone already as I've been asked already hundreds of times each day and I've only been here 2 days!""

Who in the freaking world closes their pools before nighttime especially when you pay to stay there?!  Then one that needs a face lift so bad.  And have sales people hound you constantly to boot!

I decided to try the Flamingo again because we were traveling with friends with children, and felt that they would all enjoy the pool.  I should have picked another hotel.

When we arrived at the hotel at noon, we were all eager to hit the pool.  The front desk informed me that if I wanted to check in before 4pm, it was an additional fee of $30!!!  I asked if my room was ready and they said yes, but unless you pay the additional fee you cannot check-in until 4pm.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  I have only heard of this at one other hotel.  I could not believe after paying the nightly rate, and $30 per night resort fee, they wanted another $30, so that I could enjoy their resort and start having fun on my vacation.  If you want a late check out it's another $20 per hour additional fee.

The Flamingo is located in the center of the strip, walking distance to many strip attractions and show.  It's across the street from Caesar's Palace.  Parking is free.

The Flamingo has restaurants, shops, a very nice pool, a gym.  There is no business center but they have several pay to use computer kiosk throughout the hotel.

The fitness center is at the spa and is open from 6am to 7pm.  There are 3 different pools, the main pool is adults only.  They have the beach club pool for families, which is just a standard pool, and they have a water slide pool.  The pools are open from 9AM -7PM (in the summer) except for the slide pool, which is only open from 11am -5pm.  One of the negatives is that they allow smoking at the family\/kids pool, second-hand smoke is the last thing I want my kids inhaling when they are trying to have fun at the pool.  Make sure you bring your ID when you go to the pool, not sure why, I asked 4 different security personnel and lifeguards, none of them knew why they have to check for ID.  They don't ask for a room key to confirm you are a guest at the hotel, just ID?!?!  You cannot bring any food or drinks into the pool area, even items that you bought in the hotel or hotel restaurants.  They will not let you in, you have to purchase everything from the bar\/snackshop inside the pool area.  The drinks and food are very expensive and not worth the money.

Our newer ""GO"" room was small to average in size.  It had a sort of retro 60's decor, with marble counter tops.  It was clean, but maintenance could have been better.  The walls needed painting and the mini-frig was dented. It had a spacious closet iron\/board, medium size flat screen television with cable channels and PPV for $13.  It also had a stereo system, coffee maker, mini-frig, desk and chair, and a room safe. The resort fee included WIFI for one device, and the signal strength was good.  The bed and pillows were comfortable.

The bathroom was medium sized, with a walk-in shower with multiple shower heads, a separate tub, a marble sink, and a television in the bathroom mirror.  The bathroom was clean and also included a blow dryer.

Overall this hotel is not bad.  Before a negative customer service experience in 2012, I had stayed at the Flamingo for 20 years.  Ever since the Harrah's and now Caesar's Properties have taken over they have gone down hill. The very annoying part is that you never feel like a valued customer, but rather just another person who the corporations want to continually up-charge for basic items that are free at other hotels.  I would have given it 3 stars, but because of all the hidden fees it's going to be 2 stars.

The constant additional charges and poor management will ensure that I never stay at this hotel or any other Caesar Properties again.  I would advise my family and friends to not stay here also.",0,0,0

The walls are thin - it sounded like our neighbors were in our room so if you want privacy, this is not the place. Bed was hard. Wifi was limited to one device per room which isn't realistic given how people use devices today. The pool was completely overrun with people. There literally was no space anywhere in the pool where you could stand and not be an arms length away from several other people ( and for the most part, the people in the pool were Jersey Shore TV types which isn't my thing). But the absolute worst part was the smell -- we were supposed to have a non-smoking room but our room smelled like smoke. Last but not least, there weren't enough 'do not disturb' signs.

Then the parking garage is off limits to general parking so we had to park a couple blocks behind the property in the ghetto.  I could go on and on.

If you're reading about cockroach nests and paper-thin walls or terrible service, know that it's an exaggeration.

Compared to the newer hotels on the strip, this pink bird is losing its luster; it's a Vegas classic that's showing its age. The furniture is a bit shabby and it lacks some amenities like a fridge, but it's the cheapest hotel for its central location on LV Boulevard.

I've stayed here multiple times and the only real downfall is the bathroom, a bit small with mildew in too many places. The room itself is very spacious and many of them lack carpet. 

You can tell the cabinets and desk are from another era and the TV is small, but size doesn't matter if you're partying in Vegas.

It's biggest advantage is location; it's right in view when you come off the freeway and is within earshot of the best Vegas attractions like the Bellagio fountain or the Forum shops. In the summer heat, walking distance means a lot.

Don't let the bad reviews scare you off. It's the best value for your money on a quick Vegas getaway. For special occasions or romance, splurge on something else.",10,2,3

We found a great deal online for the Flamingo and we decided to try it despite the reviews. Our flight got delayed by 4 hours and when we arrived it was pretty late but the line was still pretty long. We asked the reservation agent helping us about an upgrade and she was very nice and helpful about it. She was able to get us a mini suite for 1\/2 the price because it was one of the rooms that had not been remodeled yet and in a pet OK floor. Upon entering, our room was nice, very outdated but nice. It had a living room, shower & tub, a nice view of the pool area, mini fridge, coffee pot, and a king size bed. However, the slide door to the bathroom was broken leaving no privacy when needed and the dressers provided were also broken. It was almost near impossible to find the light switches, ours was tiny button by the bed, and to top it off the light was super dim. Our tiny room at the MGM west wing was way better than this and way cheaper. Not to mention that the no free wifi was a big turn off. The staff we encountered was nice but not nice enough to make me want to come back. 

During our stay we also decided to get our pictures taken to celebrate the occasion. I was in a rush and decided to go to the Alexandra Noel Salon in the hotel. In Chicago a blowout runs me about $40-$65 depending on the location. This place charged me $95 and that's because they gave me a ""deal."" I also needed makeup and no time for MAC so i got it done here too. The lady was really nice but tried to make me look like Snooki after I told her I prefered a more natural look. I had to ask her to remove the eyeshadow she had applied up to my eyebrows and all the bronzer she put on my cheeks, I'm a plus size gal and she made me look like I had defined cheek bones.

We checked in online via the email they sent, which helped us avoid the horrendously long lines. When you check in online you go to the ""keys and mail"" line which was much shorter. Time share people at every corner, we just smiled and always said no thank you. Elevators were run down. Pool area was nice, no outside food or drink allowed in (which was annoying). The outside gardens with the flamingos and koi fish were nice. Get a rewards card upon arrival, you get a discount at all stores and restaurants at the hotel with it.

Front desk needs help and a manager that understands customer service. When you rudely make a guest, who's been at your hotel for two days already and whose door card has malfunctioned, wait in line twice to get a replacement card, you've got serious trouble. And getting an attitude about too. Plus, you guys didn't give us our doggie gift basket... That's the least you could do in light of the urine-soaked rug you leave in there. The room smells like a barn. Just because it's pet-friendly doesn't mean you don't have to clean the place.

Elevators are broken. My wife was almost stuck, but luckily the doors opened with the floors misaligned and she managed to climb out.

The rooms have a tacky early-oughts decor with linoleum floors and beat up furniture from the 80s. If you're really into neapolitan ice cream, you'll be in heaven.

We chose the Flamingo because we are Total Rewards members. We chose the Flamingo because it's supposed to be good for pets and kids.  We come to Vegas 4+ times a year and have stayed in more than half the remarkable casino\/hotels on the Strip and Downtown, along with some of the less-known places. This is definitely the black eye for the Total Rewards properties, if not all of Vegas. Total amateur hour on Las Vegas Boulevard.

If you have tribal tattoos, like GHB and 4Loko, can't get enough beefy broads dancing on platforms and just can't seem to shake Spring Break out of your system, this is your place. If you have an ounce of class, have ever been to a real casino or don't drift, stay away. This place is the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. of the Las Vegas Strip. Ben Siegel would off this place himself.

That brings up another point: If you're paying homage to the guy that started your casino, you probably shouldn't use the moniker he hated.",0,0,1

This hotel was horrible from the minute we walked in.

It started at the beginning.  Booking the room - 99.97 for a ""60"" dollar room.  Which was fine, I understand how 'resort' fees work.  But let me tell you--this is not a ""resort"" by any means.

Cons: 
- Check in. It took FOREVER.  3 clerks working at the rush-hour of check-in\/check-out?  Not OK.  I'm sorry--but what kind of idiot is in charge of scheduling? It took me nearly 45 minutes to check in.
- Get to the front, and find out that EVEN though I booked my room on the official website, (not on Priceline, Trivago, or any other discount site) they suddenly have a new fee I have to pay. The website SPECIFICALLY said, ""Balance due at check-in: $0.00""  Even though the website (THEIR OFFICIAL WEBSITE) charged me the full $99.97 for ONE night's stay, suddenly I'm told they 'only' charged me the room fee, and that I'd need to pay an additional 33 bucks in ""resort fees.""  When I asked about this, they told me it covers 'wifi and the pool\/outdoor access to our amenities.'  Too bad the pool was only open 7-8 hours that day...in mid-July, at 109 degree temps.  THEN, they had the audacity to charge me an ""early check in"" fee.
- Get our room keys (1 of which did not work), and find out we're on the 20th floor, which I thought would be great.  We get up to our floor, ""NONSMOKING""...and it reeks of marijuana.  REEKS.  I get to our room, and we were promised a ""strip view""...we had a view of a roof, and a 'peek a boo' view of ONE hotel, that didn't even light up at night.
- The bathroom was disgusting (the shower had mildew around the edges, hair in the drain, the furniture was outdated, scratched up and damaged.  There was dust all over.  The TV was so small you could hardly watch it.  The cooler barely worked to cool the room down.  The room smelled of bleach and stale cigarette smoke.  The sheets were rough and literally felt like sandpaper on our legs, and the white bedding had stains all over it!

When we called down to the front desk to complain? They said, ""That room was just cleaned this morning, we don't have any more double queen rooms available.""  (Mind you--this was a WEDNESDAY.)
The beds, by the way, WERE NOT QUEEN beds.  I have a Queen bed at home.  These beds were ""double"" beds.  The website listed them as QUEENS.  I was beyond pissed.

We had no other choice but to stay put, because we had a show to get to.  I literally stayed out of the room until it was time to sleep.

The room was awful. The service was terrible. I was completely 100% unimpressed, and will NOT stay here again.  We slept, woke up, and checked out.
Please do yourself a favor, and spring for a better hotel.

Awful experience.  I would never, ever, ever recommend this hotel to ANYONE.  Steer clear!",3,1,1

The floors were made of a wood-like material (it had an interesting texture to it, so I'm hesitant to call it wood, but I don't know what else it could be).

However, beware jumping onto the couch over by the window in glee because of the view -- due to the floors, when I landed on the couch, I made it slide until it hit the window (gently enough, but I was scared witless because I honestly thought I was going to break the window and fall out, couch and all).

The beds are comfy, the bathroom is nice. It was an overall pleasant experience to stay here. The concierge was really slow about getting us checked in (even though we arrived pretty damn close to 1AM), so we went straight to the express check-in kiosk instead. Much easier and faster. I highly recommend this option instead of standing in line (unless you have a special request that needs to be conveyed to staff).",3,1,1

We had reservations for a couple months and were very excited to get here. I had made it a point to call ahead by at least a week to follow up on our agents request for adjoins rooms. Also to ensure I let them know that we had a late flight and would be a late check in. That way it wouldn't hinder our request for adjoining rooms. Let me back up first we have three rooms reserved and requested two to be adjoining and the other near by. When we checked in all rooms were on different floors and we were told they couldn't accommodate our request because they didn't have any rooms left that would match our request. After the  manager got involved she basically said to bad this is what we have take it or leave it. Since we were checking in so late it's whatever is left over. However, she seen all the notes and requests in our reservation but there was nothing she could do for us. After dealing with the incompetence and rudeness for an hour she managed to find us two rooms on the same floor although one end of the hall to the  other, and the third room on a completely different floor. It's terribly disappointing to spend so much time, money and effort to be treated like your nothing more than an inconvenience. That was just check in. Then we get to our room and it's smells and looks just as old as it ever did. It had been advertised that The Flamingo had been revamped and updated with modern amenities. What a joke the wooden furniture was old and chipped  away at, the bathroom looked dated and dirty. Needless to say I will not be staying here again!!!!",0,1,0

We came to Vegas for a wedding and stayed here as the bride had booked a block of rooms. The only plus thus far is that it's pretty central within the strip. 

Thus far: Parking is a nightmare. There is construction going on where the usual entrance would be and the only signage is a tiny sign hidden behind trees letting you know to make a U-turn and go around back. Then, the elevators from the parking garage to the lobby are disgusting. They look like death. Not to mention, parts are missing - as in, you look up, you can see the cables. Super re-assuring.

Check in: We arrived at 11pm on a Wednesday. We were waiting 30+ minutes to check in! I would have to imagine they're used to crowds, they should really have more than 4 people checking people in. Yowza. 

Room: The room (if you get an updated one) is fine. It's big (we had two queens, standard room). Problems: The bathroom vent fan filter was absolutely filthy. Dust everywhere. The toilet and the shower ran - constant noise. Both the lights in the room didn't work. Walls are very thin, you can hear everyone and everything in the halls and next door. Also, ask if you are going to face the pool area - music blasts until about midnight (Which I don't mind so much, but you'll want to know). The beds, I will say, are super comfortable. No complaints there.

We ordered room service - a 'movie package' which included 'large popcorn, Red Vines, two sodas and two bottles of water"" - $25.00. When I called to order the lady put me on hold three times and finally said ""I'll call you back"" because apparently this was a new menu item and she couldn't find it. When she did call back, I had to remind her about the sodas. What arrived (45 minutes later): Two bags of microwave popcorn (half popped), 4 Red Vines, two glasses of water, and two mini-bottles of soda. Excellent. 

Overall, I'm not impressed at all. I love the history of this place, and its location, but it's so not compensating for the rest of the mess.",1,0,0

The staff either acted as if they couldn't believe it was that loud or like ""well it happens."" Their website or the staff did not feel it important to inform their guests of the construction at any time until there was a complaint. In my opinion this is terrible business practice. Their guests take time and money out to stay at this hotel and depending on your luck you get stuck under construction with no explanation. 

The hotel did not offer me anything, a room comp, a room upgrade, not even a meal comp. I feel sorry for the people staying here for the upcoming convention who probably are paying double what I did.

Ok, now to let you know about my experience at the Flamingo I will need to start as I pulled up at the valet circle. I thought it was all good. I told the valet that we needed bell service. I also needed to get my players card from my trunk. The valet opened the trunk and I got my total rewards card. The valet said the bellman would be over and I asked if he needed my room number and he said no. I closed the trunk and realized that they needed that opened cause our luggage was in there. I went back to open the trunk and proceeded inside to check in. As I was leaving, I saw the bellman (what I thought was the bellman) close the trunk angrily. Oh, well someone was having a bad day, I didn't know it would be me!!!!

We checked in and proceeded to the room. Yes, it was a renovated room (four years ago, maybe) but they did a shitty job. Now granted, I have worked in the hotel business for 20 years and I noticed soooooo many patch jobs, it was horrible. I use to work at a limited service hotel and it was SOOOOO much better than this patch job. It seems like they only put lipstick on a pig. As I said before, the renovation crew should be shot and the designers should have used better quailty furniture. The room had a touch up but the bathroom WAS NOT renovated at all!! The toilet moved everytime I sat on it; the tub was very slippery and did NOT have a grab bar in the tub. The vent and shower head was rusted and flithy. Again, the towels were nice and fluffy-Good Job! The cheap hard wood floors were a joke. it had lumps in it. Bad shitty job.

We noticed there wasn't a trash can in the room and called guest services to have one in the room. The lady was nice and even joked that someone stole our trash can. She said she would have one delivered. I'm still waiting..... I thought I would give the housekeeper a hint by putting all the trash on the floor in a nice neat pile, but that didn't work.

We went to test our lady luck and it was time for my Mother to take her medicine. She went to the room two hours later to find our luggage had NOT been delivered. We went down stairs and asked where our luggage was being held. Guess where it was at.... YEP still in our trunk that they closed. So we had to wait for our car to be sent from valet and at this point, I am pissed and don't want to wait for them to deliver it so we take our own luggage to the room. 

The elevators were hit or miss. My Mom almost got stuck on a couple of elevator twice. Her alternative: walk up and down 21 flights of stairs. NOT GONNA HAPPEN. One elevator was put out of order for the duration of our stay. 

So we are checking out and I can't wait to get back to my HILTON Hotels....any of them. See two reviews up :-)  And I still can not believe that Flamingo was fighting me over my $15 resort credit. That is another story. I spend over $300 a day and they can not honor a $15 resort credit???? SHAME ON TOTAL REWARDS!!!!!! SHAME!!!

So next time, I will stay at Harrah's, The Quad (aka Imperial Palace), Bally's or Rio. I will even pay extra for Paris or Cesear's Palace but you will not find me staying at Flamingo again. I will gamble there, but I wont stay there!",4,1,1

TV was no frills - TBS, WGN, ESPN, CNN, and local channels, that's it - but no big deal.

My room had both Wi-Fi and a physical cable for Internet access - charge was about $13 per day.

We got a great deal for the renovated ""Go"" rooms and stayed 5 nights. My share of the room cost $303 with taxes! As we only needed a bed and a bathroom, this was a steal, considering it's centrally located on the Strip. 

There are only three words to describe the Flamingo and they are ""fabulously tacky"" and ""pink."" In this day and age where the surrounding properties are trying to woo you with luxurious amenities, the Flamingo likes to kick it old school. Upon entering the hotel, your nose is attacked with the scent of suntan oil--an overwhelmingly sickeningly cloying fake coconut scent. It was like there was a stoner party and they tried to cover up the pot smell and bought 1000 coconut-scented candles from the Dollar Store. However, we counted our blessings, as we walked through Excalibur the other night and walked right back out because it stank of stale cigarettes from the past 10 years with a hint of raw sewage (I shit you not--pun intended).

The ""Go"" rooms are supposed to be the Flamingo's version of luxury, which is not saying much--that's like saying their standard rooms are Kraft Singles and the ""Go"" rooms are Kraft Deluxe--however, that extra serving of American cheese was oh-so-worth-it. The beds were comfortable, there were soft fluffy pillows, and there was a nice view of the pool (we were on the 21st floor). The hotel tried to get us to upgrade to a Strip for an extra $15\/night. Fuck that, man! You want a view of the Strip? Step outside! There was a refrigerator in our room, oddly enough. Water pressure in the shower was good, and there are also these two ghetto knobs that sprayed sideways. I watched a couple of eps of ""Law & Order"" in the bathroom, but otherwise, they don't have many good channels. The bathtub is bigger than your standard size. The amenities are Gilcrist & Soames' shower gel, shampoo, and conditioner.

We also liked that we could walk to any of the other resorts. While we didn't take full advantage of the monorail, the fact that you can get to MGM in 10 minutes (versus 40 minutes by walking) is a time saver, even if it costs $5 one-way. Internet costs $13.99 for 24 hours and we did make use of it several times. Unfortunately we couldn't add more than one laptop. You can charge it to the room or to a credit card of your choice.

Reasons Why This is a 3-Star Property and Not a 4-Star 
(AKA, I work for a 4-Star hotel and am being nitpicky)
-- Thin walls. I was woken up every day at 6:30am by guests. Once I was woken up by the sounds of sexin'. If you want soundproof rooms, stay at Caesars. For what it's worth, I wore earplugs.
-- Not replacing your light bulbs does not make you eco-friendly. I counted in my room, 7 bulbs that were out on the ceiling over the beds, 2 on the desk, 1 lamp that I couldn't turn on, and 2 out in the bathroom. Good thing we only slept here.
-- Housekeeping missed the sticky residue on the nightstands. There was a cigarette stain on one of the bedsheets.
-- Long check-in and understaffed front desk. Dude, if you are wearing a suit, don't roll up your jacket sleeves to show off your hairy arms. Gross!
-- In-room dining carts left in the hallways for hours
-- Someone stole the ""V"" from the Elevators sign on our floor.
-- OS failure in the TV in the elevators
-- Donny and Marie bobble heads are for sale in the gift shop. Donny's five-head plastered everywhere... the effect is slightly disturbing.
-- Offering an iPod dock as a ""Go"" room feature and letting you play your music on the DVD player but charging $20 if you lose the power cord. There was no power cord available and when I tried to use my own, I saw that the place to plug the USB was bent at an angle and therefore useless.

Overall, we enjoyed our stay here. We found it to be delightfully tacky. We would probably stay here again if the price was right. We did think about staying at MGM Grand since we ate at many of the restaurants there, but after seeing that the douchebag ratio was rather high at MGM Grand, we were secretly glad that the Flamingo is mostly douchebag free (however there is plenty of old people, especially cougars).",5,4,5

I booked with a group of 20 (not a group booking, individual bookings but there were 10 rooms) back in November. I booked a regular Go room, strip view, for $85. I requested two upgrades: Go Mini Suite for +$72 or Neopolitan Suite for +$180. The group arrived around 3:30 and got their rooms. I was told no rooms were available and was asked to return in an hour so had to haul my luggage to someone else's room and impose. After spending money in their casino and bar, I returned to check in at 6. Again I'm told no rooms are available. I was livid. She asks if I'll wait longer and at this point my patience is tested and failing. I declined and demanded a room. She doesn't say anything to me, walks to a manager,  he returns not understanding the problem, punches the computer and she goes back to work. No one has said anything to me yet. Something like, ""I apologize for the inconvenience"" would have been in line. She tells me she's checked me but gives no details. I have a bill in front of me and she's telling me she's charging my card. I ask for what? I ask if I got the Neopolitan Suite. She says no. I ask if I got the Go Mini Suite then. She says, ""no. Yes. It's the same as the Go Mini."" 

The room was nice but not nearly like either of the two rooms pictured online as upgrades. I was not looking at the strip which is what I'd really wanted, to hell with upgrades. 

I received my bill via email (like this idea) and the option to check out (like) but notice the upgrade charge is higher than the Go Mini. When I go to Registration both the service rep and the manager are disinterested in my concern and argue with me that I got what I wanted. They said I got a better upgrade. It didn't look like the picture. I wasn't looking at the strip. And I'm paying more. Meanwhile our friends got the 1,200 sqft Metropolitan Suite (offered online for $600+\/night) and were charged $100 less than I. 

Absolutely ridiculous stay due to the misfunction of the entire Registration staff. 

I'm giving two stars because it's still a hotel, I got a clean bed, and it's centrally located on the strip with much to do. I'll never stay again or recommend. I feel ripped off.",5,0,0

I wasn't expecting a whole lot, with it being one of the older hotels and some of the reviews I've read.

However, the Flamingo was a pleasant surprise and much more than I expected.  First off it is centrally located next to Caesars, bellagio etc... So thats a huge plus right there.  When we arrived the staff was very friendly and helpful.  We couldn't check-in just yet but I understood as we were a good 5 hours early. So we hit breakfast and then the pool.

The pool was a solid attribute for the hotel.  We did several pool parties that weekend and the flamingo was almost as fun as any in its own way.  Some nice scenery (ladies) and not overcrowded like others we went to like Marquis or Encore.  Easy to get a drink and socialize without feeling like a sardine.  It was a nice change of pace.

When we checked in the room we were quite pleased.  We had a two room uprgraded suite - very spacious and clean.  Great view of the pool and mountains and nice upgrades in the room.  
The only knock was the fact that there are no Do Not Disturb signs - HUGE problem.  As a result, the cleaning lady had no qualms about knocking on and then walking in our door at like 8AM! I was laying there hungover staring at her like what the hell are you doing in here!?!  We told her to leave and she came back again like an hour later and same story - she barges in while we are still in bed.  A little rediculous - I attribute it to an obvious language barrier and bad policies.  We also argued with her several other times regarding the towels in the room but whatever... its wasn't enough to wreck my experience.  Other than the cleaning lady from hell, things were quite nice with the room...


Lastly the Flamingo casino... Dealers and pit bosses were freindly and chatty.  Players were nice and in good spirits too.  Plus I won big - always a good thing.

They would open and close, stall, not go, make strange noises. Many did not show what floor you were on. No lights lit up. On one floor there was a wire sticking out of the socket. Parking is terrible at the Flamingo. The first 4 floors don't even bother. The parking alone makes me never want to go back.

**Valet is NOWHERE near the check in area.
**Drop off your bags with the Bellman in the circular drive way ,go park and then check in. Once your in the room call #433 ,give them your Luggage check in # and they bring your bags up.
**Its main casino area is a bit outdated and it does not have the modern smoke air filtration system like the newer casinos. Yes you do smell smoke but its not smokey looking or enough to make your eyes red or sneeze.

From the time we checked in we were immediately upgraded to a Go Room from the Fab room we initially had. The room was nice, and very clean my only gripe about the room is the fact that they don't use ""DO NOT DISTURB"" signs for the rooms so the cleaning crews will come and knock on the door to see if you're there. So if you plan on having sex in the morning be sure to listen for that knock between 10am-12pm or lock your top latch so you don't get caught like a deer in the headlights. The pool areas are alright, I never used the go pool so i can't comment on that but the family pool is nice, just really small. When walking to and from the strip you'll notice the all the sales reps trying to sell you crap for free shows, I honestly don't want to obligate myself to any seminars so I simply went from trying not to be rude and listen for a moment to finally just walking by them saying ""no thank you"". It will happen everywhere including on the strip itself. I also wanted to address two things before I close this out, many people were bitching about how long the line is for registration, and how long it takes to get an elevator. First and foremost, if you've ever been to Vegas before you'll realize that registration lines are at every hotel and they are there to serve everyone not just the uptight jackass that thinks they are more important than the 20 people in front of them, so just be patient. Secondly the elevators are old and dingy but I never waited beyond 2-3 mins to get to my room or to the lobby so these 15-30 min eta's are bullshit. One of the workers even told my wife and I that they plan on doing a full overhaul on them soon so for those that had complaints about it THERE YOU HAVE IT. Overall though if you want a hotel that's clean, has good staff, and is centrally located you can't go wrong for the price. If you want a 4 or 5 star hotel then go pay the $300+ a night to stay else where and stop giving the hotel 2-3 stars for wanting champagne on a beer budget.",2,0,0

On a recent Tuesday night, 8\/13, at 10:30 pm, I was playing penny slots and had $158 in my machine I had just won. A man came up from behind me, dropped money on the floor, and stole my ticket out of the slot machine when I bent down to pick it up. The thief cashed it immediately and ran out onto the Strip where the entrances have open doorways.
Upon calling for help, a slot attendant came over and notified Casino Mgmt, and an executive named Jeff arrived about 5 minutes later. 
He looked up the printout from my machine and said the thief only took 35 SECONDS to cash out the ticket and disappear onto the street. Obviously, this thief has done this before.
Jeff from Flamingo Casino Management said I am out of luck, and they will not reimburse me---not their policy. 
Apparently, It is also their policy not to employ adequate Security officers, as it took 30 minutes for Security to arrive at my location after being called 4 times. Jeff did not even want to fill out a report --he said that was up to me---nothing they could or would do for me. He would not call the LV Police, and had a terrible attitude--very callous. 
He did not even care to know what the thief looked like, said it was not his problem. I asked him what all of the Security cameras are for, if not my and guest's safety. He just kept shrugging his shoulders. Obviously those cameras are for their protection, not their paying guests. I believe if I were tampering with his machine, Security certainly would not have taken 30 minutes to get there. 
Bottom line is that NO ONE would do anything to assist me. I went to Front Desk and asked for Flamingo Hotel Mgmt--they gave a food and bev credit for next day---nothing else--too bad. 
I called Flamingo Risk Management when I got home, and they did not even have a copy of the report their Security Officer allegedly filled out. Even though the Casino Floor Exec's behavior I described was contrary to their policy---he should have called LV Police they said, as a CRIME was committed on their property---but they would do nothing extra for me, except credit my card for 1 day resort fee of $34.01. 
Also, this $34.01 Resort Fee credit was a ""Gesture of Good Will"", as per Flamingo Management---laughable.

I don't exactly understand the negative reviews, but as a Total Rewards member who plays at all of the Harrah's casinos, perhaps I am biased, since I feel I have been taken great care of at all of their hotels. 

Flamingo is not only on the strip, it's CENTER strip, so the location truly cannot be beat. Walking north to Venetian, or south to Planet Hollywood is easy, and crossing to Caesars is simple, too.

The one complaint I will concur with is the thin walls, which I noticed particularly on my February visit. We were in the room closest to the elevator on the 8th floor of the Spa Tower, and I heard that elevator dinging at all hours of the night and morning. I bought ear plugs on the first night because my boyfriend snores, so I didn't experience it in an overall sleep-disturbing way, however.

Parking has never been an issue for us here, but we typically stay Sunday-Wednesday. We've won money, lost money, eaten in the food court, checked out Margaritaville, and at the end of the day, this is still a very nice hotel. 

Here's my only concern about some of the negative reviews, and should serve as a warning to potential hotel guests: what the heck are you complaining about? You spend 8-10 hours in the room, most of which are with your EYES CLOSED. Who cares what the room looks like? And just join the Total Rewards club already, so you don't have to wait in that huge line to check-in.",8,1,1

On our last night in Vegas, we wanted to stay on the strip compared to the off the strip accommodations we had in the previous days over at the Las Vegas Hilton (See review)

I had SEEN the Flamingo GO rooms and when I saw a current deal that had it at $55 (Total with tax and no resort fees) I decided to book it. 

We get to the front desk and our front desk agent upgraded us to one of the GO Suite rooms with a view. She didn't have to, but she did and I am forever grateful since I did not have any cash on hand to tip her. I will hopefully be able to show thanks next time I am here--If I go here anytime soon. But if not, hopefully good karma comes her way.

So we get to our floor, and it is obvious it's ""GO"" time. See what I did there? The ""GO"" theme is pink, as is the main theme of the Flamingo. This theme spreads throughout the hallway. The door to our room and just the vibe prior to entering the room had me believing it was going to be a small room. Upon entering you are hit with the openness of the GO Suite room. The living area is fairly large. 

The theme as mentioned goes with the rest of the Hotel... PINK. It was not overly done, and it was just right. The room was very chique. We had a nice view of the strip and could see the Bellagio fountain show. One of the many PIMP features includes the motorized sheers and blinds. You go in there and press the two buttons and it opens up the blinds and curtains. The windows themselves span across the room and it is floor to ceiling height so it is very open. 

You go to the bedroom and you are presented with the same window treatments. Full view of the strip, windows floor to ceiling height, with motorized blinds and sheers. The bed setup is also nice. There LED accent lights on the top, and adjustable ones on each side. THE BED IS COMFY!! It had nice support yet really sunk you in like you were floating on clouds. 

As for the bathrooms, the suite room has 1 and half bath. Right from the entrance and in the bedroom. The bathrooms don't have locks and the window is opaque so you can see that someone is in there, but can't make anything out. This maybe a problem for a few especially if sharing with others. Same goes for the bedroom bathroom. There is a single person tub and separate shower. The shower has strong pressure WITH BODY SPRAYERS! His and her sinks in the bathroom located in the bedroom. AND YES THERE IS A TV BUILT INTO THE MIRRORS! 

Both the living quarters and bedroom have separate flatscreen TVs. Looks to be 42"". Also comes with nice sounding 2.1 channel sound system, you can hook up your media, has a USB port, and optical drive. 

The living area has a couch that does turn into a bed for extra guest.

So why minus 1 star? Although the TVs are HDTV, there was NO actual High Definition programming. It's like buying a Ferrari and only staying in 1st gear. Why do establishments still do this?!?!

Also the sound system in the bedroom was broken. It just didn't work anymore. One of the lamps also had a bulb that was out.

Internet was not free, but that is common these days.

At the time of booking, there were two hotels that were the cheapest and on the strip. The Flamingo and the Excalibur... We stayed at the Excalibur about ten years ago and liked it, but it was towards the end of the strip so we decided to pay the extra $20 and stay at the Flamingo since it was pretty much in the middle of the strip. 

Parking:
I read on the website that parking was free and located behind the hotel. When we got there, the valet was full so I went to the taxi stand and dropped my family off there. The parking garage is about 7 stories high, with the first three stories reserved for valet parking only. Let me say this, it took me about 45 minutes to find a parking spot on a Saturday night around 7pm. I believe they share parking with their other network hotels, and they don't really verify who parks there, so pretty much anybody can park in there. The rest of the days it wasn't as bad, but the garage is still packed.

Check-in:
Check in was quick and easy. There was no line and it probably only took about five minutes to check in.

Room:
The room we had faced the interior of the hotel, so there really wasn't a view. To be honest, we really didn't care as we weren't going to spend much time there. For four of us, the room was enough for us, the two queen beds were very comfortable and the pillows were great. The bathroom was outdated and showing age, it was also very small. They only offered one bar of soap and two bottles of lotion, nothing else. We ended up going to CVS and buying small travel kits.

Food:
We were on a budget for this trip and planned on trying to eat cheap. The hotel didn't really have cheap food options, which was a bummer. The other hotels within close walking distance didn't either, but that's okay. We did eat at the hotel one night and the food was pretty good, but came out to about $15\/person.

Location:
The location is great for the price, literally in the middle of the strip, can't say much more than that.

Check-out:
Check out was a breeze. Again, there was no line, we just walked up, returned the key and gave the room number.

Additional:
There is no free wifi at the hotel, the prices are as follows:
$9.99 \/2 hours
$13.99 \/24 hour for only guest room

Honestly, if people want Bellagio style rooms, service, ambiance...then cross the street and go to the Bellagio. Also, take the extra money you'll need for all of the extras. 

When I booked at the Flamingo I knew what I was getting...an older hotel, with really good prices, and a fantastic location. 

I have no complaints whatsoever about the Flamingo. 

It took me 10-15 minutes to check in, the staff (all of them which I ran into) was friendly and very helpful. The casino is a little older, and it smells like cigarettes but it's not unbearable. 

Free parking is always nice. 

The room itself was decent. It was clean, it wasn't smelly, it wasn't falling apart inside. It had a bed, lamps, chairs, tables, a couch, and a TV. I wasn't planning on being in the room too often anyway. The pool was cool also. 

I will say that the first time you walk out to the habitat portion of the hotel it does smell odd BUT you get used to it. 

Most importantly, the LOCATION is what did it for me. You can not beat being in the heart of Vegas. I walked everywhere and the I went to the Bellagio for their nightclubs. I loved the location. 

I'd recommend it for people who know that being in the room is not as important as having an amazing location in the center of the strip (where getting to your room is easy especially after a night of heavy drinking). The rooms are good, acceptable, clean. The staff is friendly. The parking is free. The pool is clean and fun.

There are cons :
In the morning, housekeeping came into our room and told us when we will check out. We were supposed to stay another 3 days so it didnt make any sense.
We told about it and they left. After an hour another housekeeping lady got in room. In fact I was in shower but she were standing outside and talking to me when I check out! Whats wrong with them?!?!

Our room tv, side beds lights were broken. 

Bathroom door is slide door and it doesnt close properly so you can hear sounds of when people goes to toilet. 
And of course there wasnt lock in bathroom.

My toothbrish is electronic one and housekeeping broke it.

This hotel doesnt have enough parking so when its full, you have to park either Imperior palace or Harrah's which are 15 min away!

Our room key stop working 2nd day and had to claim about it. 
They gave new key but still didnt work but FOUTUNATELY housekeeping didnt close our room door properly so it was loose and could get inside. 
After we went out, we try to fix our key. It was 3 am. There wer few people in line for checking in or dealing with similar problem like ours. 
It took 40 min for us to get over front desk! 40 min!!!! Thats insane!

Room wall is really thin so you could hear both sides people's talking.
Everynight my right hand side room people stayed up late and partying so it was kinda hard for me to fall asleep.
Other side room people started fighting. They yelled each other and it stayed several hours.


Those reasons, I wont recommend this hotel to anybody.

The hotel is about a 10-15 minute walk to the Sands Expo so it's perfect if you're attending a convention there. I was actually pretty pleased with the Linq strip mall area too. The selection of stores and restaurants there were pretty well thought-out and definitely cater to the 20-30 crowd.

The good thing about this place is it's not so huge that you get lost in the casino. Everything is within reasonable walking distance. It's not the hippest, the most grandest, or the liveliest of Vegas hotels but its sort of right there in the middle and well thought-out. I stayed in the Go Deluxe room and although I felt like I was sleeping in Liberace's guest room it was clean and modern and had a decent view. The only thing I didn't like about the room is the bathroom door is just a piece of sliding glass that has no locking mechanism. I'm not a fan of rooms that are so modern that it sacrifices on privacy. Especially since one of the guest beds was just a couple feet from the toilet with only glass separating the two.

Only real gripe I had was the $50\/night resort fee that I was forced to pay for. When I booked the room I was not given the option to opt-out of the resort fee although once at the Flamingo it seemed to be an optional package. Despite that I still paid less with the room and resort fee than many other popular hotels on the strip. I would definitely stay here again if I was on a business trip or looking to save money but still get the full Vegas experience, but probably not if I was with the wife and kids on a family trip.",4,0,0

We had stayed in a Go room in July 2012 and thoroughly enjoyed our stay, so we decided to stay at the Flamingo for our 2013 trip.  Our room was on the 18th floor and there was a large yellow trash can right outside of the elevators catching ""water"" from a leak in the ceiling.  

The furniture in the Fab room was terrible.  I did not unpack my clothes as I didn't want to put them in the ratty old dresser with the wood that was chipping.  The bathroom is totally outdated.  There was no plug in our shower and the water pressure was so strong it was painful.  I also had the mirror that hangs on the wall fall ON me while I was standing in front of the closet.  

The food court at the Flamingo was one of our favorite perks as it was perfect for late night eats.  Well, the food court is CLOSED due to plumbing and it didn't look like it would open any time soon.  Also, since Bill's next door is being totally remodeled, there is construction, dirt, and homeless right outside the Flamingo doors.  

We will never stay at this hotel again.  It's hard to believe that it's totally gone downhill in the span of 1 year.  You are better off staying across the street at the newly remodeled Bally's",5,3,1

I was there for a training class, and my experience was echoed with everyone else in the class.  I won't go into great details on everything, but here are some of the lowlights:

Way over-priced.  I've stayed at at least 5 other hotels on the strip that were better and cost less.

Unfriendly staff.  The check-in counter was unhelpful, and I felt so unwelcome in the gym that I almost didn't go in.  Paying something like $15 to use a treadmill for an hour should at least come with a smile.  The poor service was constant - even asking people questions on the casino floor got reactions worse than almost anywhere else I go.

Oh yah, the super-fancy treadmills sucked.  Bad.  I tried three of them and the treads stuck so bad that I almost hurled myself over the front.

No wi-fi in the conference center.  How does the hotel have wi-fi service everywhere except a place where people are actually trying to work?

Can't say for sure why, but I couldn't get cell phone service in my room.   I could get service in the basement, but not in my room.  This is possibly not their fault, but I doubt it.  Between the two of them, the only place I could get both cell phone service and wi-fi was on the casino floor.  

Other comments from people in my class brought out a wide range of problems.  One of them finally left after the staff was so unhelpful in finding him a quiet room after his first room was rockin' until 4am from the club across the street at Caesars.

If you need to be located in this general area on the strip, try Bally's or the Hilton suites right behind the Flamingo.  Both are far superior and less expensive.

The only complement I have was that their music selection on the casino floor was very interesting.  I heard some songs I like that I would never, ever expect to hear there.",2,0,0

So the photos of the rooms are not the actual rooms. Not even the newly remodeled ones.

But let us start at the beginning...

We stood in the check-in line for no less than 40 minutes at 10 p.m. on a Friday. This gave me plenty of time to inspect that unwashed masses that frequent the down-stairs area at night. It was like seeing the lights come on in a strip club at four in the morning. 

Fine, whatever, it's Las Vegas and it's not exactly the Wynn, either. 

We get up to our room, where the air-conditioning unit sounds like it's got emphysema. The paint int he bathroom was chipped. There was no floor-mat in the bathroom, either. No fridge, no coffee maker. Just a creepy pink-fur rug on the beds, like someone pelted a pimp.

No one got much sleep because of the AC, so the next morning my dad called the front desk and asked that someone come fix it. At two he called again and found out that the person he spoke to in the morning neglected to actually put in a service request. At 9 p.m. we called again. A technician finally came up and inspected the AC unit (claiming all the while that he'd been up to our room earlier). This time he figured out what was actually wrong. By 11 p.m. the AC was quiet again.

Did anyone offer to put us in another room? No. Offer comped amenities? Nope. *Apologize* for the inconvenience? As if. 

The signal in the hotel is pretty awful, too.

The rooms were decent with a good view of the strip and they had a mini fridge. Location on the strip is great. Beds are comfy. Showers are nice. The staff was friendly and it is a adequate hotel for Vegas. 

Be aware:

1. They charge $30 to check in before 4pm. Arrived at 8am. Could not check in early. At 3pm was still told we couldn't check in without a fee. At 3:45 they checked us in, but the room was still not ready and was told to come back in 30 minutes. 

2.  The elevators are shotty.  In 3 days, every elevator had issues. From simple buttons not staying lit to shacking\/vibrating , to ear piercing screeching, to scary dropping a few inches once the door was open. Get this fixed ASAP!!! Some people got suck for a while and had to be rescued. This is not good for a hotel to have elevator issues with ALL the elevators (two different sets, with 6 each and all with problems). If it wasn't that we were on the 17th floor, I would have walked instead of taking a chance in these death traps. 

3. Resort fees. As if they don't charge you too much anyways. When booking online, fees are mandatory. At the hotel, in fine print they are optional.  Not really sure how that works since they already were charged and could not be reversed. Make sure to call direct and see if you can argue these. It appears they cover crappy wifi and gym usage. If you don't use these, why bother. Even with paying the resort fees which included 2 devices on the wifi, it would only allow one. 

4. Breakfast buffet. Not good. Nope, just not good. Most items sat way to long before being brought out. Very disappointing breakfast.  Biscuits were hard as rocks. Potatoes where raw and cold. Bacon was greasy. The list can go on. Omelets and crepes were the only good things available (made fresh). 

5. Can be very noisy with partying 20 somethings (blaring music) the noise comes right through the door. Also you can hear anyone outside in the hall. The club across the street (Omnia) blasts it's bass until 4am which vibrates the rooms.

We checked in around 6pm tonight and the crib was not in our room, so we called the front desk and reminded them. ""Sorry, it'll be right up."" 

We called 2 more times after returning from dinner to no crib, and they said it would be expedited. Still no crib. We eventually gave up around 10pm and tried sleeping with our baby in bed, but it was fitful and no one was getting sound sleep. So around 12:30am, I marched down to the front desk to raise hell. The desk manager told me he had no clue what happened to all the other requests, but that it would now be up in 20 minutes and they were ""expediting"" it to ""urgent"". An hour later, we just got our crib, at 2am. It took 8 hours to get a crib. 8 hours!!!!

1. You're on a budget and don't plan to stay in your room very much 

2. Location (fairly central on the Strip and easy access to other hotels- Paris hotel is right next to it and Caesar's is across the street) 

The negatives: 

1. Parking- not very obvious entrance, we had to consult a friend to figure out where to go and ended up entering on some random backstreet behind the hotel. It was probably because we got there around 10 on a Friday night, but finding parking was pretty much impossible until circling for 15 minutes and finding literally the last corner spot in the lot. 

2. Hotel service- we had several hiccups with our room, which had all of the basics; I was expecting a dirty old run-down carpet, but instead we had hardwood which was a slight upgrade. But re-directing, one of the most egregious issues we dealt with was when our toilet ended up overflowing. We made a call to the front desk the second the issue arose and the individual at the front desk said they would send someone to take care of it. An hour later, we called again to say that no-one had come to service the toilet, and the front desk responded that they would submit a service request to maintenance. We wanted to get our day going and left for a few hours only to return back to the room with still an unfixed toilet (SERIOUSLY?) We made a third call down to the frontdesk and they responded as if we were highly inconviencing them and  they  were unaware of the status of our service request... eventually after some more prodding someone eventually came to fix it, but the amount of effort and lack of responsiveness was just unfathomable. Several other instances during our visit we had requested items from the front desk (toiletries, etc) and none of it ever got delivered. They did give us a lot of towels though. 

3. Some of the renovations around the hotel are kind of tacky-- the women's restroom behind the buffet literally had a sign made of cardboard and a piece of tape stuck to the wall with ""Women"" written on it in sharpie.",3,3,1

Don't stay in their shabby rooms on the lower floors, pay just a few extra bucks and stay in their ""Go Rooms"" and get all of the amenities that you get from the places that tell you that they specialize in luxury.  Flat screen TV's, great views, King size beds, and cool decor.  

It also gives you access to a pretty decent pool and a hotel that is right in the middle of it all.  It's easy to get to Caesar's, Mirage, Venetian, and some of the smaller hotels right in Center Strip.  

They also have an adults-only European pool that is optional topless and a few of the girls take advantage of it.  They also do a strip contest on their pole that's in the middle of the pool which reminds me of a sad Lake Havasu and really adds nothing to the afternoon.  The live DJ is a nice touch though and it's nice to have an adults only pool right below your room and the Cabanas are a pretty good deal at $300 + a bottle (around $175 for the bottle).  

Sure, there are way nicer hotels now, but you won' find a better room quality to dollar value.",3,0,2

Didn't have a problem the whole visit. Went to check in and the line was soooo long. Decided to use the kiosk to check in. Took 5 minutes with no problem. It even gives you directions to your room.  Room was fine. It was clean. The only thing wrong with the room are the shampoo and conditioner. The worst ever. Make sure to bring your own. The walls are kind of thin but it didn't bother us at night. There were lots of options to eat. Great location. I enjoyed the poker room. All the staff were very friendly. Went to the Donny and Marie show. It was very entertaining. We were in the very back but could see just fine. Not a bad seat in the house. Checked out using the kiosk and once again had no problems and it took about 2 minutes. Overall enjoyed the hotel and would definitely stay there again.,0,0,0

Recently had a wedding there, in which the chapel itself was great along with the employees.  However I can't say the same for the hotel itself and the staff.  Had approximately 50 people attend and stay at the hotel in which we did a room block so that we would all be close to each other.  That definitely did not happen at all, not even within 5 floors of each other.  My sibling was informed 2 days prior to arrival that their room was being downgraded from the suite they booked months in advance to a small smoking room.  When they called the hotel and informed them this wouldn't work they were told you can cancel or upgrade your room for a few hundred dollars more.  The manager claimed they informed them a month in advance via email, yet they received an email the week of saying that they were all set for their suite.  The manager said that was a lie and they would need proof that actually happened, but had to pull their foot out of their mouth when the email got forwarded to them.  After an hour of them not wanting to do anything they finally agreed to change them to 2 connected rooms.  Another party arrived in their room in the morning of check in, only to find that they had no water at all.  When they went down to talk to the manager and staff they were told there was nothing that could be done and hopefully there would be water later in the day.  A good half dozen others also arrived to rooms where light fixtures and shower fixtures were dangling from the wall.  Aside from the chapel staff that was great, the rest of the place is trash much like the staff and management.  Hopefully that eye sore finishes imploding on itself and the strip can get a better place or a dirt lot which would still be better.

I really enjoyed staying in the GO room. 
I loved the most was the white quilted patent leather bed board thing. It reminds me of quilted leather bags which I love. The bed was also super comfy and even though there was only a thin layer of blanket for the bed, I had wonderful sleep in that bed. I also did not get PINK EYE from the pillows like I did at THE MIRAGE! Ew.

The decor is white and pink and some brown. I like how it's so modern and the automatic blinds control is pretty cool. But the coolest thing has got to be the TV INSIDE THE MIRROR OF THE BATHROOM. Awesome! I was watching TV all the time when I was in there! There are also speakers in the ceiling. I loved the shower because I love glass doors for showers. Shower curtains are gross man. And a separate tub and shower is the way to go. Also! The sink was A BOWL SINK! AHHHH I LOVE IT!

The closest also had the biggest safe in a hotel room I've seen so far. I loved the couch and just about all the furniture in the room.

Very comfortable and enjoyable stay at the Flamingo, but probably only in the GO room or a suite.

The Flamingo is generally a go to for our Vegas vacations, we usually stay in the newly remodeled ""Go Rooms"" which are fantastic! Clean, cute and a great location. 

However, this visit we booked a ""Fab Luxury"" room. I didn't realize what a difference there was in the rooms! First of all it took over an hour to check in because it was overcrowded and under staffed. That's all fine and dandy, stuff happens right? Now, we finally got to our room, after an exhausting and hot drive to Vegas, only to be repulsed upon entry. The bead spread (which is furry for reasons I can't figure out), had some funky, brown, sticky goop on it that caused the fuzz to all clump together in some disgusting pink clustergunk.  Ok, gross so I pulled it off the bed and tossed it aside. We continue to settle in and realize that the lamp table and floor beneath are COVERED in sticky nasty mystery sludge, to the point that I can make out footprints in the gunk.  This is followed by the discovery of clumps of hair on the bathroom floor and a filthy tub. 

This was all enough for me to be seriously grossed out. We tried calling the front desk to no avail. So, I marched down to speak to someone in person.  The girl at the desk was very pleasant and informed me that normally they would move us to another room, but because it was booked solid she would have someone come up right away to clean. We waited, and waited, and then we waited. Nothing, the entire night. We went to eat, walk around and still no one had come. 

The next morning, we went out and about for the day and saw that someone was coming to clean our room, excellent! So we thought. We came back to the room after a few hours to find that everything was exactly the same, save for the made beds and a few new towels. So, again I go downstairs to speak with someone. I am told once again that someone will come clean right away. We go to our room, and wait. What do you know...someone came. A grumpy, disgruntled, irritated woman came and aggressively scrubbed the goop off of the floor and table and then handed me some towels and left.  

Overall, I was extremely disappointed by The Flamingo. The food court was closed the whole time we were there, our room was absolutely filthy and the pool closes at 6pm (how lame). Next time around I think we may just spend a little more and stay somewhere with some standards. Massive fail Flamingo.",7,3,2

Dirty, dingy, in ill-repair, and in general a very poorly run hotel. If La Quinta and the DMV had a baby, they would name it Flamingo. Check-in line was 45 minutes long. When we got into out room, there was still trash from the previous occupant. The furniture and fixtures were pretty beat up.

Oh, and the elevators... Holy crap... One had a disco strobe light show (not intentionally), one ALWAYS stopped on 12, for no reason, one sagged a foot when the doors opened and then would rise to level with the floor, and in 1, all the buttons would go dark when the doors closed, so everyone was scrambling to push them again for their floor.

This was a continuous topic of discussion with pretty much anyone we rode the elevators with, in every elevator bank. A few people we spoke with actually got STUCK in an elevator for a while.

The food offerings were terrible and overpriced.

The highlight really was the bell staff who were friendly, attentive and helpful.

The hairdryer started smoking and stopped working except for the heating element was still heating up very fast (fire hazard!).  We left a note for housekeeping on top of the tip we left; about the dangerous hair dryer and it was ignored and in fact we didn't even get new hand towels or washcloths.  The alarm clock was unplugged and I had to move furniture to plug it in and re-set it.  I did appreciate that they supplied a power strip next to the bed for charging electronics.  Ironing board and iron were supplied and a safe in the closet was nice to have also. They've also started charging $10 per day for self parking in ADDITION to the $35 daily ""resort"" fee.  I've stayed in this property many times over the years but the state of disrepair will force me to look elsewhere for spending my lodging dollars in the future.  Very sad.  In addition to my disappointment in the room, Flamingo has closed their coffee shop restaurant and opened a very expensive food court instead... horrible ambiance, terrible lighting and depressing atmosphere.",0,0,0

The grounds are very interesting, with tons of beautiful things to see.  The best part, in my opinion, of this hotel is the PRICE.  I got the most trendy, updated room for $45 a night.

Somehow the pool area of the Flamingo found a way to turn up the heat by offereing free 10 Cane rum from 6pm to 10pm on a Friday in a setting where bikinis were the correct outfit of choice.

It started off relatively bar but slowly but surely the place got packed with what looked like LA chodes and chodettes.  Probably not the best for social interaction but at least they provide something decent to look at.  The music was alright and if I had dressed more appropriately (shorts and wife beater) I would have probably been able to do a whole lot more than sit on my ass and gulp down Jack and Cokes for a few hours.

I really did feel like this place had the potential for a great night of drinking, dancing, and fun in the pool.  A few degrees cooler and I bet people would have been more apt to get up and shake their asses poolside.  If you ever hear about a pool party at the Flamingo I would suggest dressing to impress (poolside) and heading over.

Previously their low end rooms were ok but since they started to renovate their rooms they have ignored their non-renovated rooms to force customers to upgrade but instead this just pushes their long term customers away. The room I had which is suppose to be non-smoking has cigarette smell every time I go into the room. The first day there was no hot water and even after the engineer came, the hot water only comes if you run it for 5 minutes and only if set all the way to the hottest and then you have to tweak it back to warm afterwards or else start all over. I mean I didn't come here to live in a motel. Also it's not exactly cheap either.  Sink has similar issues. When I called to guest services to complain they sounded like why the hell am I bothering them in the first place. Very poor attitude every time I called them about anything even extending my stay. 

My team member says his floor smelled like piss everyday. Yes the non-renovated floors look very poor. Elevators are banged up. Their food court is closed and seems like the food court restaurants moved to Bally's.

My room sometimes doesn't even get made and if there's no tips for that day, they make sure you know they are not happy. Like I have small change every single day since we stay there normally for 9+ days each stay.

It use to a good hotel but now it may look like a hotel but it feels and acts like a motel.

Not to mention they closed off 1\/3 of the parking lot and made it valet only. It was hard enough to find parking lots previously but now it's almost impossible unless you pay for valet. 80%+ of the valet parking area is empty. What a waste.

Am glad we only spent one night here because the Hilton Grand Vacation Flamingo wasn't available on the Friday evening.  I booked Flamingo using AirMiles and this may have influenced the room we got.  When I booked, I requested an early check in and a non smoking room.

The night before we checked in, I went to ask about the early check in.  I was told that early check in would result in a charge of $20-30 (I can't recall the exact amounts) depending if we wanted to check in before or after 12PM.  It wasn't worth paying extra so we went to check in at 4:30PM after their 4PM time.  Be prepared to line up.  The estimated time was about half an hour but at least they offered small bottled water.

We checked in and waited by the elevators.  The elevators are sloooooow and not just during check in (Waited at least 5 minutes at 10PM and 9AM).  There are 2 sets of elevators, with the one set saying it will go down only (there are 4 elevators and they are used by staff but they are faster than the other ones so I recommend going down from your room using these ones).  Some of the elevators like to rock and roll but don't worry, this seems to be normal.

Our room, 10062, was the first one at the end of the hallway.  I wasn't sure how noisy it would be but luckily it wasn't too bad.  Being spoiled by HGV stay, we didn't appreciate there was no mini fridge, no free wifi anywhere in the hotel\/casino, and an old room.  The bathoom vanity has paint peeling off, dresser and desk had knicks, and grout in bathtub.  I wasn't sure if we paid the resort fee as we did have to pay fee and taxes booking using AirMiles so I called to ask but we didn't.  I think the fee is only for wifi for one device\/room which doesn't make sense.  

The worst issue was the loud hum when it was time to sleep.  It sounded like an engine and luckily I was able to fall asleep with this noise.  When I woke up, there was no hum.  We didn't want to bother lining up again to check out so we did so via the TV system for self check out.

Yes, the hotel room is only to sleep in but when I'm on vacation, I want to be comfortable and well rested.  Makes it difficult to do that when they don't offer the amenities to enjoy the stay.  I noticed the receipt of people in front of us at the bag drop off and couldn't believe they paid more than $170 Canadian to stay in this hotel.

The decor is a bit kitschy but not too flamboyant. A coffee pot, mini refrigerator, television in the bathroom mirror were all nice touches that helped make for a pleasant stay.

The food and beverage options were nothing spectacular but sufficient; however,  the service was well above par. Pleasant and accommodating.

Overall I found all of the employees very friendly, talkative and helpful especially the girls in Club Cappuccino near the check in desk.

The room was much larger than I expected, with two queen beds, each one covered in very clean looking white sheets with three down pillows each. I particularly liked the floor length windows which overlooked the garden and pool. the room came with  electric drape openers, You did not even need to get up out of bed  to open\/shut drapes.  
I especially appreciated the thermostat in the room - I like being able to adjust the temp to my liking. It is also energy efficient - It turns on when you slide the key card so it's not running the entire time you are out of the room.
The bathroom was well stocked with amenities. There were three sets of towels, each one being very nice think & larger than the usual. It was cool to have a TV built into the bathroom mirror. The room came with both a rainhead shower & body sprays plus a spacious bath tub. Caveat for group sharing: privacy is limited to frosted glass doors on both sides of the bathroom.
The room comes with a small refrigerator so you can load up your own beverages. The coffe pot is cute  & coffe was actually pretty good.
Check in was super easy, and you can actually check in from McCarran airport - which I will try next time I fly. Check out was also easy - via video link or just express drop-off in the lobby. 
The pool is built for soaking, not swimming and caters really to kids, which is nice. The monorail has a stop here, but I did not go on it - it used to be free but now you need to buy a ticket.  
There is only one buffet area, a small Burger Joint (that is actaully its name) that only serves burgers and sandwiches one way, that is, not to order. They did have a colossal shake, very good. I tried to have lunch at the Japanese resaturant but they only have udon or ramen dishes - open for sushi only for dinner. 
I tried to get to a show but the theater is dark on Sunday & Monday for Donny & Marie.

Its main virtues: it has a near perfect center Strip location, with Caesars Palace, Bellagio, and Ballys as neighbors; it's one of the cheaper places in the immediate vicinity.  Add to this reasonably comfortable rooms and a very good swimming pool, and I can overlook the negatives: run down feel, boring restaurants, mediocre gym.

Registration is available at the airport, although once at the hotel you must still go to the registration desk (but using a very short line).  One time, the line at the airport was very long, so I crossed my fingers and decided to register at the hotel.  This worked out well, as the line was very short, and I was done in less than ten minutes.  However, beware:  during my stays I've noticed that at times the line was horrendous.

We had a group of six people, 4 of which were visiting from Brazil.  I must say that the greeters were very nice, but that's where the good experience ended.  Upon opening the elevator at our floor, we were hit with an overwhelming damp, old problems with plumbing type of smell.  The carpets, elevator, and floors were absolutely filthy.  The carpet was so old and dirty, that it was stretched and lifting off the floor.  I really hope that there wouldn't be people with mobility issues walking here as they would fall.
Our room was very dirty.  You can tell that the cleaning staff had not been trained, or were not being supervised well.  The floor in the bathroom had hair all over, the towels were stained, and everything looked very dingy.  The bed itself seemed clean (I checked).  We sat down and got alerts for our credit cards that things were being authorized for more than what we were told at the front desk.  We went down and complained about the pricing and filth.  Turns out that things were not explained to us very well upon checking in regarding authorizations and costs.  When they heard about our rooms, they promptly switched us to another floor, all three rooms.  
When we went to the new floor, the carpet was a little cleaner but not by much.  We had a cracked mirror in the bathroom, everything was still dingy, and one of our group found cockroaches in the bathroom.

The room itself was spacious and enough to fit a lot of luggage. I wish the bathroom was more spacious or updated. The door was in way of the shower and the toilet which made is a bit convenient to share with a lot of girls. 

The staff were extremely nice. They were very accommodating when we needed extra towels and an extra set of keys since we misplaced our first set. For the price I was paying it was not bad at all especially since it was at the center of the strip. Very convenient to everything!

First of all, don't let the name fool you, the ""high roller"" rooms are just rooms with a view of the high roller ride outside. The bed was ok, the pillows were so flat and hard. The floor had old school linoleum that looks like wood BUT ITS NOT. The bathroom was falling apart literally. The tiles at the bottom of the sink vanity was broken and caved and a lot of scum. THE PICTURES OF THE ROOMS ON THE SITE ARE SUPER MISLEADING. PHOTOSHOP IS A HELL OF AN APPLICATION.  The shower was super old with a shower curtain which is ok but our shower leaked aaaaaaall night! Room service cuts off pretty early at 1pm so if you sleep in with a hangover,  don't expect to eat in bed. The staff is pretty nice and they have a pretty good buffet that's about it.

Then at check-in they tell us we should have called earlier to request connecting or close rooms. Sigh.

I don't think i've ever stayed in a nicer\/larger suite in my life. Two bedrooms, full bar, three flat screens not including the two tv's per bathroom inside the mirrors? Dining table, lounge area, this place was bigger than my apartment.

Although I didn't pay for any of it, so I can't really yelp the price\/value aspect, the Flamingo is a bit outdated, i had a chance to see the normal rooms and they are as tacky and aged as it gets. The lobby area is too old-fashioned and attracts an older crowd which isn't my thing and the tables need a bit of life injected into them. I noticed that they copied planet hollywood's pleasure pit by adding those gogo dancers at the 2nd entrance...  imitation is the highest form of flattery?

But let me say this...I have NEVER EVER in all my years of going to Vegas (close to 40)...have I not had valet as a guest in the hotel...EVER..worse thing is no one gave a crap everyone had same song of verse of how busy that weekend was..not ONE apology ...2 days we had to self park and hike a long way in a cruddy parking lot...sooooo angry. THEY WILL NEVER GET MY BUSINESS AGAIN for the way they handled that mess. Check in wasn't too bad because we pre checked in on line. 
I still like the location and the room we were in on the 20th floor had a nice strip view.
This particular room was, I guess low enough, That the music from down stairs and across the way was very loud on the weekend.
The beds were good but during this trip I note that the pillows were the worst pillows in all of history. Little hard knobs of foam or something they didn't ""give"" much... Ugh
The hallway carpeting was so lose I tripped twice.
The elevators by the habitat are a joke..lights didn't work the doors will slam on ya.
They told us they have everything you need at the pool..if course you have to walk all over creation to get to it..it's only in the adult pool they have things besides drinks and food..also the kids pool slides were closed.
Just a bad experience all around...I had my daughter and grandson and I didn't want everything to be so disjointed.

It's good to note that the bathroom door is a sliding frosted glass door and while it was fine for us it may be awkward if you're staying with people you're not extremely comfortable with. 

When we checked in I asked very nicely if there was any way we could get a decent view (even though we hadn't paid extra for it). The man at check in didn't immediately acknowledge this request but as he handed us the key he told us to enjoy our view. Our room was on the 17th floor and looked directly at Cesear's Palace. When my boyfriend and I pushed the chaise in the room against the window we were able to lay on it together and watch the fountains at the Bellagio.

The entrance is hard to find due to construction.
We arrived only to find the valet full...ok no problem. My husband decided to wait it out so he pulled in a waiting area with a few other cars while I ran in to check in. 
The reason we were in Vegas was for a dance competition for my 6 year old...so we had her and our 12 month old baby in tow. I decided to bring my kids with me inside with me to check in. Since check ins are usually fairly simple I thought we would be in and out. WRONG!

I cheerfully stepped in line only to have that cheer stripped away after the line hadn't budged for over 40 minutes. Steadily it got longer and longer while we waited and waited. I had someone hold my place in line to go try the ""express"" check in...but wouldn't you know it...my reservation was not found. So back in line I went. They had about 2 workers working the counter and one worker servicing their ""rewards members line"". So while there were about 150 of us waiting in line...the rewards counter never called any one of us. 

After an hour and a half I started to contemplate leaving. But then I saw a glimmer of light at the end if the tunnel. Another worker appeared. Hallelujah. This person then proceeds to go to the rewards section where there were a hefty 2 people waiting! What a joke! People were getting out of line to go sign up for the rewards program just to get out of that nightmare of a line.

We finally got to the front of the line 2 hours later...my 6 year old barely hanging on to sanity and her bladder by then. 

When we arrived at our room we called right away to get our bags sent up. 1 hour goes by...nothing. I call to find out what's the hold up. They tell me don't worry we're on the way. I leave to go get dinner for my family...come back to the room and still no bags! I asked my husband did they call or anything and he said no. Wow...really. 2 hours to check in then 2 hours to get our bags! By this time I needed my kids pajamas and my baby's diapers etc. So I decide to go down to the bell desk and find out what's going on. I am told that they had an ""emergency"" and that my bags would be up soon. I ask is it normal for check in and bag delivery to take this long and I was told by a manger ""the bell desk has nothing to do with check in so whatever you experienced over there is their problem"". WOW. 

After we finally get our bags...get our babies settled...we whip out our laptops. Time to surf the web...plan our itinerary...etc. No internet. WTF! They have the ever loving nerve to charge $13.99 a day for internet. This day in age internet is like air and water...it should be free. If I can wander into a random Starbucks and get free internet why the hell can I not get free internet in a room that I'm paying for???? What the bloody...sigh. Good thing I had an air car but still. That meant that only one of us could surf the web at a time. And to be honest...I think they were scrambling wifi signals in order to force people to buy the internet. Our smart phones were barely working...and my air card mysteriously kept dropping. Extortionists. 
The website touted ""completely remodeled rooms"". Oooh exciting right? WRONG. The room was far from remodeled. It may have been resurfaced...but by far no remodeling had been done. Just because you slap up a fresh coat of paint and buy a few new bedspreads does not mean you've remodeled anything. All the fixtures in our bathroom were covered in rust. The toilet paper holder was hanging out of the wall by one screw. The toilet barely flushed and the shower was more like a fire hose. I swore every time I took a shower a layer of skin was ripped off by the uncontrollable water pressure. Paint chips everywhere...around the vanity...on the back of the bathroom door. The shower curtain was dirty...it was all around shameful!

The buffet = gross and overpriced. Every last piece of food was freezing cold and I need to introduce their chef to a brand new invention that everyone is using...its really cutting edge...it's called SALT. I have never in my life eaten such bland mush. This was the first buffet I have ever gone too where I not only didn't want seconds...I wish I could have taken my plate back over and put every last bit of slop back on the buffet. 
The pool was at least nice too bad it closes at 6pm. I have even more to add but there is a character limit! maybe I'll do a part 2",7,5,2

-I got a great rate on the room
- It has a central strip location

The Bad:
- Self parking has 7 levels, but the elevator only goes to 6. The 7th has a very large deceiving sign with the word elevator on it. 
- Their buffet is the worst I've ever seen at that price point. 
- The carpet is bubbling in the hallways making a super long walk to the room even more difficult with rolling luggage. 
- Staying in the 'Linq view ' rooms is a joke. Only a partial view and loud noise day and night. You can hear the Carnivale bar at Harrah's all night.
- Only 1 device per day is included with The Resort Fee
- The AC constantly reverts to auto. Meaning if you want the fan to run, you have to adjust it every 10 minutes when the system flips from on to Auto on its own. 


The Ugly:
-I cut my toe on broken glass from a previous guest within minutes of arriving in the room. It took an hour for them to send someone. I ended up asking a housekeeper to mop up the blood and potentially more glass. 
- The elevators feel like death traps. No ac in them. Only one worked in the parking garage. They also lack the sensors to stop if someone is still in it.  I have the worst bruise(extremely painful) of my life trying to hold the door after letting people exit before getting on. 
- The rooms with bathrooms that haven't been updated have mold and mildew covering the tiles and grout. 
- Someone vomited in the hallway. It took 2 days to get it cleaned so you could no longer see that person's dinner.

Within a few minutes a group fishing game came up, where everyone played. It was fun, and I won $30. It was prominently displayed along the top of the machine over my chair.
Except the points didn't copy to my machine. The others at the tables next to me all saw it. I called someone over, his name was Jason, and he was very nice. He got his manager, who looked on the machine and said the winnings didn't show. If they had showed, I wouldn't have needed to call her. She made me feel like I was trying to get away with something. She didn't believe me or the others who spoke up. Frankly, it ruined the day for me - not the $30, but the assault on my integrity. I found my husband, handed him my tickets to cash in and walked out. I won't be back to the Flamingo.",1,0,0

Usually when you get these kinds of deals, the bottom line is that you get what you pay for. We really were surprised with how much fun the pool scene was! Just an fyi, the mojitos at the pool are the slushy kind - not fresh and really not good. 

It's an old hotel (the rooms are a bit modern - not the bathroom though) and the construction from the strip to get to the self-parking is a bit mis-leading but we did enjoy our stay. We liked going through all of the new shops and restaurants that were conveniently outside of the hotel.

We checked-in early - please note that to the right of the check-in line you can go to a kiosk and use the self check-in machine. Nobody was using it and we saved a ton of time by not standing in line! Others in line followed what we did and couldn't believe that not more people were using it. The machine even gives you your room keys! There is a concierge there who will show the rooms that pop-up and which are smoking vs. non so you can choose your floor, etc. This was super helpful! 

Back to it being an old hotel, one of the elevators would not open it's doors to our floor and we thought we were stuck. That was a bit disturbing when we tried it twice - we just got in another elevator. 

Since we checked in early, the computer for our check-in must not of let housekeeping know that we were there because our bed was unmade. I tried calling the front desk and our room phone didn't work. So, we proceeded to get ready to head to the pool when housekeeping came. We definitely surprised her that we were there. She made the bed and was super friendly and gave us tips about the new shops.

Don't forget to place your privacy note on the door, they will start knocking as early as 6 AM. Also the walls are thin ( did I mention it's old?) so you can hear housekeeping knock on the doors and hear the people in the bathroom next to you. You can also hear the music from the shops below - it's pretty loud around 7 in the morning! If you are a light sleeper, make sure you drink a lot and you won't hear a thing. :)",6,1,1

It is pretty dirty as compared to places like new York, new York, Mandalay bay, etc. At least half of their elevators are out of service requiring us to take the stairs from the fifth floor. We were appalled, it literally looks like a horror film in the stairs with walls kicked in, garbage, walls stained, drug paraphernalia, etc. My guess would to save money on labor keeping other areas cleaner as compared to the places people travel frequently. Then at the customer service desk, my wife and I waited for a minimum thirty minutes as six ladies walking behind laughing and joking while one worked with customers. They avoided eye contact and kept disappearing doing who knows what.

Unless you are Diamond or higher with Total Rewards, there is a mandatory resort fee of $30 a day, which includes daily Wi-Fi for up to 2 devices and access to the gym.  I HAVE to get up to Diamond status soon because the Wi-Fi can be constantly slow, and it makes me repeatedly sign in.  Definitely not worth paying for.

The last time I stayed, I was able to get a Go room facing the Strip, in the Habitat towers.  Great view of the strip.  And there's a TV in the bathroom mirror.  Ooh, we fancy, huh?
Self check-in helps alleviate the crowds so that the line at the check-in desk is not too long. However, you have to run around all of the people trying to scam you into a timeshare. THEY ARE EVERYWHERE.

The elevators for the Spa rooms are quick; the Habitat tower elevators ARE ALWAYS SLOW AND ALWAYS MALFUNCTIONING AND ALWAYS BROKEN.  Which leads to an elevator stuffed with 20 or so people who stink like booze, smoke, and sweat.  Yum.

The best part of the hotel is the ""sanctuary"" outside.  Flamingos, lots of birds and fish, and penguins!  It's a beautiful stroll to wander through and sets your mind at ease before a day of heavy drinking and gambling.

Decent place to stay while you are in Vegas.  And for those of you complaining about the rooms, just about how much time do you spend in the room anyways?  It's Vegas.  Get outside and enjoy yourself!",12,2,4

That being said, the casino is nice enough, albeit kept a little too warm for my liking. With all the bodies and smoking in the casino, even when it's cold outside it would be nice if the casino temperature was kept at a cooler temperature.

I like the addition of the food court so that you can grab a quick (cheap) bite when taking a break from losing all your money. It's also nice to take a short stroll through the garden area and check out the flamingos and the massively huge catfish in the pond. Jeeze. What the heck are they feeding that guy?

The first time I stayed at Flamingo, I left my iPhone 5 charger in the room and realized I left it behind two hours after I checked out. I called Flamingo and their phone was at busy tone all day! I called back later that evening and asked to be connected to Lost & Found. Gave them the room number, my information, the description of where I left the charger... They're response, ""Nothing was turned in from that room and someone is now staying in it."" I asked if the housekeepers would've looked for it before clearing the room to let someone else check out. They said ""That's something small.. we don't check those things."" They rambled on not admitting that it was wrong for them to skim through the room rather than fully checking out the room. So this was my first experience which was bad.

My second experience with Flamingo would be this past week. I stayed there and left my facewash that I just recently bought and was fully tubed. I called and gave them all information and they responded saying since it's face wash, they throw things like that away. Are you fucking serious?? Not even a full day, and they throw people's shit away?! I know I know, face wash.. but it was expensive facewash; Sheseido not Clean&Clear. That is not the point. It is the principle of their service for not holding people's lost items. 

So annoyed with this hotel. Would definitely not recommend to stay here. If you do, make sure you take everything with you when you leave, because apparently they throw or probably take your shit. Worst hotel ever. I work for a hotel, and Lost & Found department keeps everything they find.",3,9,0

Pros- The location of the strip is great, its in the heart of the strip, with 4 star hotels and casinos near by. Its also near a lot of restaurants and a couple clubs. The outdoor lighting of the flamingo gives it a lot of spunk. 

Cons- The room I had was pretty dark, but the overall cleanliness wasn't something to go home talking about. You get what you pay for here.

This is not the first time i have been treated rudely at this hotel, but it will definitely be the last! I have been a loyal platinum member at the Harrah's properties for years, and I am shocked that the hotel management would allow staff to treat people the way I was treated. 

Saturday, 6\/23\/12, morning was the first kick off to the party. After 30 minutes in line and 30 minutes of unsuccessfully finding chairs, we just got a bucket of beers and got into the pool. After my second miller lite, I got out to go the bathroom, and while walking out of the bathroom I decided to call my girl and give her an update on the trip. Well it seems as though you can't have a phone at the pool, because a security guard, Craig S, with a very small overly aggressive god complex charged at me, and in his most hood like language accused me of taking pictures of girls. I immediately said that was crazy and that he is more than welcome to go through my phone to verify that I was doing no such thing. His response was ""I don't need to see yo damn phone!"" He then accused me again of taking pictures of girls, even citing that some phantom girl said I was taking pictures. I again explained to him that I was using my phone to talk not to take pictures, and this time pulled up my photo album and told him to look. In his most educated ability he mustered up the same ""I don't need to see yo damn phone!"" 

Well by now people are staring, and 2 other security guards had rushed in for backup, as Mr S again accused me of taking pictures of girls. Now frustrated that he refuses to accept actual proof I said look this is f-ing crazy and I am not some creep that would do that and to stop accusing me of it. Well I guess that was enough for him to say ""your out."" I told him no problem I'll go, but that I gamble a lot with his employer and that I would be filing a complaint for what he is unjustifiably putting me through. He told me, now with his heaviest of gangster accents (I guess that makes him tough) ""go ahead, yo casino status mean nothing at the pool!"" I said ok and that I need his name. His response... (really tough now!) ""can't chu read muthaf$&@er"" I turned around, looked at his badge and said ""yes I can Craig S"" I then made it to the front, full escort of 3 security guards, at which point I stopped to put my shirt on as people gazed at the scene that had been created for... what I don't know, maybe Craig hates his life. I mean a simple glance at my phone and a sorry for the misunderstanding would have seemed much more appropriate. 

I proceeded to file an official complaint, which I was met with many apologetic people. Too bad the one guy I would have appreciated an apology from was not brought to the room. I filled out a complaint form, and ranted the story of what had happened to me over and over furious with anger. I asked the security, if you spend 10 grand a year at your local grocery store and a checker began accusing you of this while you stood in line, would you still shop there? He had no words. 

After being told, or how I interpreted it, that the complaint would be sent directly to an investigator's trash can and that I will receive a mass produced BS email saying ""we would love to have you back"", I decided that my only recourse is to vote with my wallet.

I went to VIP services where I was met with cardboard cutouts of people. I told the agent that I would like to check out and asked that they refund the next 3 nights understanding that I had never in my life been treated this way and 2 hours in to my bachelor party they had officially ruined it. That is a request that a VIP cardboard rep can not process, so the manager of the mill was called over. She gave me the same line that a refund was not possible. By now I was done, I looked her in the face and said ""look if you want to charge me to treat me like dirt, go ahead! I'm still out of here""  she then wiped out 20,000 reward credits and said she would have the money refunded. Mmmm, maybe she thinks I am stupid but using my comp points is not a refund! The sign on the door is very misleading, VIP services... what service?

I booked a last minute replacement at MGM, and will now forever be living the Mlife! Unless, of course, they decide to steal away the employee of the year, cum laude graduate, better known as Craig S.",7,6,2

The original pool is gone, as well as Bugsy's Rose Gardens.   This place has lost all of it's charm.   Lunch was terrible, service was even worse.     

I am just so happy we didn't stay here, because if they can't even take care of the main part of the hotel, I can only imagine the state the rooms would be in.

Our room was nothing special , but hey it was $37 a night .. the bed was comfortable. Be aware of the timeshare hustlers .. they are flamingo employees and they are very nice, but beware!
I will say that one day I noticed (dear gawd please let if of been from a dog) excrement in the hallway .. and it stayed there all day .. I even watched housekeeping walk right past it. 

The Pool- get there EARLY like right when it opens or you will not find a chair. I mean it ! 

The flamingo has great location on the strip they also have a pretty good brunch buffet with unlimited Mimosas and Bloody Mary's for $21.99

I needed digs on the middle of the Strip near Caesars Palace (where my posse were based) and paid extra for 4 nights in a renovated, tricked-out GO room at the Flamingo after seeing some dodgy reviews here for the regular ones. 

My room rocked! Everything looked brand spanking new and I totally loved the two flat-screen TVs (one embedded in the bathroom mirror), cool electronics, edgy-yet-retro decor, and  neat little lighting effects. For the money, the GO rooms are a top-class deal. I was on the 26th floor and had a stellar view of the Strip to boot. The bed was big and comfortable also- crucial. Given the Flamingo's prehistoric (by Vegas standards) age, I was nicely surprised by how fresh and spiffy the rest of the hotel looked. Everything inside and on the grounds was spotlessly clean and smartly appointed. Check-in and out was fast and friendly, like all the service that I received. 

The casino was spacious and easy to navigate. The slots are fairly loose and I got an hour of play out of $1 on one of the video poker machines. I did my table gambling elsewhere as the $10-15 minimum bet was a bit much for my budget. 

The pool area is just awesome, there's a major tropical theme going on and there are palm trees, waterfalls, and lush foliage everywhere. It really feels like you are in the Bahamas (or Singapore or anywhere hot, lush, and tropical really!).  It really is fantastic. There are loads of bars and snack stands nearby, however you do need to get down there early to grab a spot. There's also a GO pool with DJs spinning and topless sunbathing permitted. 

However, after sunset the Flamingo kind of falls on it's backside. The nightlife options are definitely NOT aimed at the hip, young, and beautiful. I wasn't attracted at all to the main show (the Osmonds-yuck!) or in their flagship nightspot: Margaritaville (what is it with that bloody song anyway?). The Sin City Brewery did look more promising, at least for daytime\/early evening drinking, though I didn't stop in there. There is a burlesque show (""X-Burlesque"") also. Regarding food- the room service fare is passable and does arrive when they tell you it will. The Burger Joint is decent too. I didn't eat at the steakhouse, the coffee shop, or the Japanese restaurant onsite. The coffee stand (Pink Bean) is ace and serves rockin' java (read: lotsa caffeine!) as well as all sorts of yummy pastries. 

Wrap up: Get a GO room (they are WELL worth the money), play the slots, hang by the pool, hit the Pink Bean, and just go to one of the nearby resorts for cutting-edge nightlife or more cosmopolitan dining options. All in all, the Flamingo was a great choice.",3,1,1

I don't really see much of a difference. The pool back then was pretty terrible but my friends vouched for the pool and said they think the renovations must have gone to the pool. 

Here are a couple of our observations we experienced during our weekend stay:

- Guests like signs to help us find where to go and where things are. So the ice machine wasn't where the sign said it was and it led to a mini expedition. 

- Guests like the cold. If you're in the desert, don't you think each room should have a mini fridge? Especially since you can't find the ice machine? 

- Guests like service. We called for additional towels. It took an hour and we had forgotten that we requested for them. Also, another hotel guest ordered room service in our hallway. An entire day passed where the trays in the hallway hadn't been picked up.    

- Guests like a clean-looking hotel. The carpet was stained and needs replacing - wouldn't you think that's an important part of renovating? The crown molding was coming apart in the hallway. 

- Guests don't like to imagine getting shanked. These hotel elevators looked like they belonged in a shady parking garage where a drug bust would go down. I'd rather ride the Tower of Terror. We thought that the elevators in the parking structure were bad enough but those in the hotel were out of East Los.

No WiFi. Wasn't a fan of the conditioner\/shampoo. The TV could have been bigger but at least there was one. Not all the outlets had socket covers. 

Your fire alarm works. The fire alarm notification went off at the wee hours of the morning. We get that this is protocol but is it necessary to notify us half a dozen times? Just when you are drifting back to sleep, it would start up again. Perhaps it's the due diligence in trying to notify people hard of hearing because the side effect was waking everyone up from a somewhat drunken slumber. 

It helped that the location on the strip was excellent but for $75 a night, my friends and I set our expectations low. You get what you pay for. We got a bed to sleep on. It was a last minute trip so we went with price.",2,0,0

This place has gone to shit and goes out of their way to make visitors inconvenienced. First night here we had barking dogs in the room next to us that barked all night and security said they couldn't do anything about it other than leave a message for the people because they cannot invade their privacy. Ummm what about the paying guest being kept awake??? Then the next day I asked for an extra pillow and was told there are no more pillows in the entire resort?!!  Then later that day we came back to our room which had the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door to find that they ignored it and came in anyway and just made our bed and went thru my purse!! A compartment I don't ever use was opened that's how I know. If all that wasn't bad enough we woke up this morning..very early..7:30am in Vegas..hello!!! By construction going on in the room below us. So loud it sounded like it was in our room and I recorded it and had them listen at the desk. It went on for hours and I was told it was going to continue so I would have to move rooms. Another inconvenience!!!  They put us in an ""upgraded"" room for our last night there. Once again we were awoken at 1:30am by the club right below us banging music and a guy screaming on a mich. that lasted until 4:30am. Decided to try to go to the pool where they were turning away guests left and right for some of the most ridiculous reasons like wearing jeans making for very angry guests. We got thru the line by the skin of our teeth only to find that there was not one lounger available at 10am!!! Because they allow for people to put their towels down to save a lounger for later and leave the pool. Leaving the guests who are there at that moment with nowhere to relax. This literally is THE worst hotel in Vegas now in my opinion and numerous others who were at the front desk complaining. Never again!! Don't waste your money!!",1,1,2

Do keep in mind that this hotel is one of the oldest hotels on the strip, but has recently undergone room renovations. If you decide to book here, my only advice is to reserve a GO Room. These rooms are newly renovated, modern and very high tech. Our room had a clean feel. There are many mixed reviews on this hotel. Partly because of the room selections that guests are choosing. I highly doubt you will be entirely dissatisfied with the GO Deluxe Room. After all, the bathroom mirror has a TV installed and the view of the strip is breathtaking. 

A few other tips... The casino is wide open facing Las Vegas Blvd. so everyone passes through this casino while walking the strip. If security is a concern, look elsewhere. It was also a little strange because there was no security standing near elevators which I think this hotel needs. The timeshare people are super annoying so be prepared to ignore them all day, everyday. Also we made the mistake of grabbing Johnny Rockets as soon as we arrived and it cost us something like $40.00 which is way overpriced for a food court. If you're looking for a snack, there is a pizza place, near the room elevators, that sells huge slices and margaritas for $5.00 each. 

This hotel is probably okay for all ages, but could potentially suit people on a budget looking for a great central location on the strip. Hubby had no luck winning on the machines, so gamble elsewhere. Customer service was nice. Housekeeping was friendly and always left extra toiletries. We had an A-okay stay at the Flamingo and would not hesitate to stay again.",14,1,2

I stayed there last week after being relocated by the Rio Hotel due to unforeseeable circumstances.   The Flamingo staff was extremely nice and help.  They accommodated all the parties I went with and put us on the same floor only a few doors away.  The rooms were cute and somewhat vintage with the feel of the hardwood floors.   

There are a few cons which brought down my rating.   There was no refrigerator or coffee pot in the room.   It was kind of a bummer especially in Vegas.  The bed was comfortable, however, it needed blankets.  Where are all the blankets???   I was super cold that night with the sheets (but I guess I could of called for blankets).   In addition, the bathroom needs just a little upkeep as the wood below the sink area was scuffed and dusty.  Also the tile in the bathroom needed a good scrub down with bleach.  It was kind of moldy. Our bathroom door was warped and chipping pretty bad from the steam in the bathroom.  But mostly the room was just was dusty.  We pulled the night stand out a bit to plug in our cell phones and a ton of dust shifted.   It was dusty dirty not filthy dirty.  I think if the hotel invested in cleaning the rooms thoroughly (moving items and all) and spiffed up the bathroom bit (maybe a coat of paint and deep cleaning the tile) it would step it up.  

I would definitely stay at this hotel again, but will call for blankets ahead of time.",1,0,0

This was the second time I came since my sister was married at the hotel a few years ago, and since that was a good experience, we decided to come back. Now I can say, I will NEVER go back.

We upgraded our rooms to a ""suite""...and when we got to the room, it was no better than an old standard room with wood headboards...old paint...dirty mirrors. NOTHING SPECIAL TO IT AT ALL! The only reason they called it a suite was because it had wood floors that extended farther from the beds to the window and it was nothing but empty space. We complained... and we got switched to a GO room which they originally told us they didn't have.

We misplaced a cell phone from the previous room we were upgraded to and we were told security would get us from our new room to retrieve it from the old one...security never came. We had to go to lost and found and the guy working was a complete asshole and made us feel like were were an inconvenience as he had to get up from his chair.

During the cleaning of our room, the maids took some of our belongings. We called and complained and since one of our items was white, they told us were were Sh*t out of luck and we won't get it back while they laughed at us. 

Also, the pool was closed early (we tried to go at around 6 and 7)...ITS 100 degrees outside during summer and the pool is closed? WTF?

The manager was no help whatsoever and didn't care that he lost our business. I will not be back. I would rather spend the extra money to go to a better hotel that provides better customer service.

I asked why can't you take care of it here and she started babling and I left.
I went back to the kiosk and the kiosk told me check in could not be completed, please see the front desk.

Our flight got in at like 2 am and rather than pay $200+ for 8 hours in the room like we would at Palazzo (where we stayed the rest of the trip), we decided to give the Flamingo a try. I've always been kind of fascinated by it and its kitschy old Vegas appeal- the pink neon, the sordid mob history, etc.

Parts of the Flamingo have been remodeled adorably and parts of it still miss the mark. I would love for them to just go all-out retro and put some pink shag carpeting in the rooms and make everything as awesomely tacky as possible. If they renovated the rest of the rooms à la the Go rooms and did some remodeling of the casino floor and other areas that haven't quite been updated yet, and maybe if they kicked out Donny & Marie, this place could be well on its way to awesome.

So our room was very cute and in terms of looks alone, I would give it 4 stars. Unfortunately, behind the hip exterior things were not quite as clean as I would expect. I mean, there was an empty condom box in one of the beds.

It was also pretty hard to get to sleep; being an older hotel, the rooms are not exactly sound-proofed and I could hear the thumping and bumping of music in some club ALL. NIGHT. LONG. We were super tired and got to sleep anyway, but if I'd had to stay here for more than one night, that would have driven me absolutely nuts!

I wanted to like the Flamingo so much, but it just didn't live up to my expectations.

But - this hotel has definitely seen better days. They have revamped the rooms so they are ""updated"" but as many casino\/hotels in Vegas has definitely had its years of use and abuse.

To start the regular rooms - they are big and functional, no-frills rooms. Definitely a place to crash. The Go rooms are better - but painted white so you can see the use in these rooms very easily. A little more nifty with the tvs in the bathroom mirror versus the regular rooms. 

The elevator situation stinks no matter where you are. You wait and wait for an elevator.

This hotel is heavily trafficked - and you will hear people all night (especially if you are facing the strip - you will hear the Omnia across the street, the people running up and down the hallways, etc.)

We had been told that the rooms were old, but good and got there EARLY on a Thursday morning to try to upgrade if possible from our reserved room. Well.... we were assured that we had an amazing room and the woman at the front desk (who we were really chatting it up with) said she would ""hook us up"" with a great deal\/great room. The only problem was that it wouldn't be available for a few hours. We thought - no problem! We left our luggage at the bell desk and went out to chill in the little grassy area outside for a while, gambled a bit, checked out the grounds. When we returned and got our room, I was horrified.

The place looked like a crime scene. Large red stains all over the carpets, smoke-stained drapes, dingy\/scratched side tables. The bathtub, bathroom vent, and counters were lined with mold in every crevice and rust on many of the surfaces. Our shampoo was partially used. The shower curtain was BARELY hanging onto the cracked bar. The closet sliding mirrored door was completely off it's hinge. I'm usually not a neat freak, but this room was totally unacceptable - especially at the rate we were paying. The room looked TORE UP.

My boyfriend and I immediately went back to the lobby (of course, it's packed by then!) and asked for a different room, calmly listing our complaints. The person we talked to couldn't have cared less, and said that they were ""completely"" booked. We considered driving back home that night, but were then offered another ""better"" room. We checked it out, and although it was an improvement (not as much mold or stains), it still fell FAR short of what we expected. We were told that ""we're upgrading the rooms in July"" but that we would just have to deal with the rooms ""as-is."" What really shocked me is that no one seemed to care about the stains, the mold, the dirty bathrooms, the rust... no one offered to get a manager or even let housekeeping know about the situation.... or in ANY way make it right for us\/future customers. In fact, I KNOW they booked the room because they told us they would be able to give it to someone else right away and to ""get any of your stuff out of there."" Um.... gross. No upgrades to another suite. We went to the new room, and figured that we'd be heading back the next day.

Luckily, we were able to work with the company we booked our travel through and were offered an upgrade to the GOsuites (the ones that were ""completely unavailable"" earlier) - which were a huge improvement, but also cost us quite a bit. The HOTEL offered no apologies for the inconvenience of schlepping the bags to three different rooms or any concessions to make our stay more comfortable, but the room was at least clean, cute, and had a good view.

Although the GORooms are cute, the whole hotel seems to ""miss the mark"" as another Yelper put it. The customer service is very poor, and although I'm interested in seeing what the remodel will bring, the experience was so bad that I doubt we'll return any time soon. Other issues included the pool closing at 6pm most days (really? It's still hot hot hot!), a real mismatch in decor throughout most of the place (are they trying to be South Beach? Retro? Jimmy Buffet hangout? Upscale kitsch?). And placing annoying time-share people around every available elevator entrance\/exit to harass people day and night. They lack a cool lounge area for drinking. The ""Sin City Brewery"" is probably the best on-location spot to drink (outside of the pool, which is decent), but it lacks the sense of atmosphere you would think a place like the Flamingo would have...

I think this place has SO much potential, but it really falls short of the goal of being this cute old-school ""classic"" that it seems to aspire to. I hope these guys get their act together for the sake of preserving LV history, but my expectations are pretty low at this point.",4,0,0

The Flamingo isn't the nicest hotel but I expect a clean room. I told the front desk woman (Fran) and she didn't seem to care. The manager Frank gave us a free upgrade. The room he gave looked exactly the same as the dirty room. I called to tell him because I thought it was an error but he said the room has the same decor and its a few inches bigger. What happened to a good old fashion upgrade to a nicer room? They even offered additional days for more than the original reservation. Nice!

The Strip Was Built Around Us

The Flamingo is one of the old school Casino\/Hotels in Las Vegas. Many of its contemporaries (Dessert Inn, Sands, Stardust, etc.) have been torn down. Others like Circus Circus are dwarfed by their more modern and shinier successors. As such, this Hotel is nothing special for Vegas goers, and for folks like me, this is where the meeting was held, so why not stay here?

My upgraded Room (in the Spa Tower) was about $80. It was roomy, clean, and comfortable, albeit dated and in need of refurbishment. And at this price, there was no coffee in the room or anything else past the most basic of amenities. In hindsight, I should have maybe splurged and stayed somewhere fancier, but considering the short stay and my focused business purpose, I did just fine.

The Conference Center part of the Hotel was much better. The meeting rooms were comfortable and very conducive for business. The Lunch Buffets were fabulous and the service in this area was excellent. It was also nice to wander out into the outdoor green belt and view the Pink Flamingos, despite the John Waters flashbacks.

Gamblers also have their choice of the main casino areas or a separate Margaritaville area. I was a Good Boy in staying of this sort of activity or any subsequent search for lost shakers of salt.",7,5,3

Pros: I can't say there is a lot that was positive except price, but I guess now I know why it was so cheap.

Cons: Many....

Parking - We arrived at roughly 30-45 mins after 3pm check in time.  There was absolutely no parking at all in the structure after driving around it for a good 10 minutes.  Why?  The hotel seems to save over half of the spots in the structure with RESERVED signs for valet and many other things.  In the end we had to pay an extra $18 a day to valet.

Check in - Huge line.  Went to the self check in Kiosk and it was very quick.... however, upon arriving to our room.... nothing like what we had booked and not sure if this was because we didn't actually check in with a human being?

Room - Dirty.  AC vents filled with dust.  Bathroom floor tiling that looks cracked, dirty.  Everything was pretty antiquated.  The AC was not cooling properly, even when set to 65.  And the AC was located above the shower in the bathroom!?!?  One light in the bathroom was not even working.  TV was slow to even change channels.  My bed must have been very old, as just moving on it when laying down caused springs to make squeaky sounds.  Outside window facing a very dirty, unkempt set of roofs with glass that didn't look it had been cleaned for over 10 years.  Wifi you need to pay for with none of us getting any cell service on our phone due to the old building likely having thick walls preventing cell tower coverage.  On top of all of this, the room was not at all what we had seen when originally booking it.  We had booked specifically because the room had 2 queen beds and a couch.  Upon arriving, this room had 2 queen beds and a simple chair.  We needed the couch because 2 of our 4 didn't want to share a bed and 1 would be sleeping on the couch.  Upon calling the front desk to ask for a room change, they told us it was not likely to happen.  So we asked if they could bring a rollaway bed and they promptly replied that it would be a charge.  Had to ask for a manager and complain that this wasn't what was promised, and after some talking they caved and comped us the rollaway bed.  When the bed arrived, it was the saddest looking bed.  It was caved in, as if an elephant had sat on it and broken the springs. 

Check out - We asked for a late check out on Monday and were given all of 30 minutes extra.  Really??  Even after experiencing all these issues, as well as leaving on a Monday (non busy day), they refused to budge on giving us a late check out around 1-2pm as we had asked.",6,4,1

This is a bit of an old hotel but they have been trying to clean up by remodeling all of their rooms. I prefer the GO room which is contemporary with a splash of some retro style. How long are you going to stay in your hotel anyhow when being in Vegas!?! Now that they have started charging the resort fee at all of the Caesar hotels I may think twice now of staying at one.

One great thing I love about this hotel is that when you walk out of the hotel you don't need to walk a mile to get onto the Strip. The Caesar's is directly across of the Flamingo which is a great plus since we usually go to Club Pure and the many eateries there.

The Flamingo has a great 21 and over pool with live entertainment on many weekends. This is nice when you don't want a bunch of kids running around and splashing water everywhere. If I am leaving my kids at home I sure don't want to be bothered by other people's kids.

I hope that they remodel the entire hotel and provide better eating\/entertainment options at the Flamingo if they want to stay competitive to the other hotels in Vegas.",5,1,1

I say ""usually"" because its location is unbeatable and on the occasion that I do go to Vegas during an expensive time & don't want to fork out a fortune for other hotels, I would settle for this hotel.

First issue: parking. It was free which was a plus, but parking fees will soon be implemented. Valet is very limited and I would avoid it because it is unorganized and takes forever! I wouldn't want to wait over an hour to retrieve my car. The parking structure is small and is shared with Hertz as well as the Hilton Grand Vacations hotel. The structure is poorly labeled, so it is confusing on where Flamingo guests are allowed to park. I circled around so many times and once I got to the top and there were no more spots, I had to reverse & go back down. I eventually parked in a Hilton Grand Vacations spot. There just isn't enough space.

Check-in is usually busy regardless of the time, but luckily there are now kiosks for self check-in. There are also employees available to assist with the kiosks, which was helpful since I was having problems scanning my driver license. The kiosk prints the room keys & directions, which makes the process so much faster & easier.

There are multiple elevators. Figure out which elevator you need to use to get to your room because they are in different areas of the hotel. Some elevators look and feel like they will break down at any moment. Others seem to be newly renovated or painted.

Some rooms have been renovated and others have not. Some rooms have not been renovated, but just repainted and replaced with new, but cheap, furniture. I've entered and\/or stayed here 3 times, more or less (out of 100+ Vegas trips in my life) and the last time I stayed here, I got a room that was accessible through the Habitat elevators. The elevators were okay, not scary like some other ones. The room was dark, felt bare, the bathroom lock was broken, and the lighting was really bad. It's so dark that it's almost impossible to get ready. I've spoken with others who said they had to open the curtains during the day to use the natural light outside to get ready because the room is so dark. The floors and furniture seem to be updated, but is minimal, cheap, and doesn't add any warmth. We got a dark view of a wall, but I didn't pay extra for a view so no big deal. Don't expect much in terms of amenities. If you forgot a toothbrush, they will tell you to go down to the store and buy one.

All in all, you get what you pay for. This is a hit or miss hotel. It's not the worst, but also not the best. For the price and location, it is usually a great value. If staying here, I would recommend a room with a strip view or one of the newly renovated rooms\/more spacious rooms like the GO rooms. If you are on a budget, no problem. Even the cheapest rooms have all the basic necessities. It's a decent hotel with rooms that are accessible from the inside, not like a motel, and has a private bathroom. Walk out of the hotel entrance and you're on the center of the strip, across from Cesar's Palace & the Bellagio fountains. This place is filled with a young crowd, so it gives an upbeat and party vibe.",2,0,1

You get what you pay for- I didn't particularly have very high expectations for my stay here, so I suppose this hotel delivered. I quite enjoyed that I was able to get a fantastic deal on a mid-strip hotel room with a view of the High Roller, plus did I mention two complimentary ride tickets to the world's largest ferris wheel of the same name? Indeed, yes I did. 

You can tell that the Flamingo did some rennovations, yet at the same time, there is still some work to be done. Our room was on the 18th floor, and while the overall room was very nice, the bathroom was really anything but. But alas. I didn't spend a huge amount of time in the bathroom- it had running water and a working toilet, so I was willing to let the appearance pass. Also of note and on the list for future renovations is the inside panel of the elevators. So run-down, they look like they are straight up out of a horror movie.

Walls are thin, but then again, I don't think that I've yet stayed at a Vegas hotel whose walls weren't super thin. I was here for three nights, and was woken every morning around 5am to some screaming teenagers in a room who knows where, but definitely not directly adjacent to mine. Annoying. Top that off with a tapping noise coming from within the walls that seemed equivalent to Casper's friends clanking chains upstairs, and I was a pretty happy camper come sunrise. Not really. 

So, despite the somewhat negative review, I didn't mind my stay here at all- in fact, I would be tempted to stay here again. Really, a hotel in Vegas is only for sleeping at night and the occasional nap after you've eaten too much at the buffet. For all intents and purposes, Flamingo fits the bill.",2,0,0

It may be for the older crowd, but they're definitely re-vamping and it's the best location on the strip- closest to everything.

Room: Clean, maid service is great, views are swell. I was in a GO ROOM and the noise level was horrible... even on the 28th floor. I'm also not sure why but there is a door that goes to the next room here. I could hear our neighbors very clearly. 

Bathroom: The water pressure in the shower is extremely low. It takes a long time to shower. They include four drinking cups but the water is not filtered. (They want you to spend $$ on room service.) Vents make weird noises but that may be just in my room, I'm really not sure. 

Amenities: Although the Internet and Gym here costs $15 and $10 per day respectively it does help to notice that this resort does NOT charge a daily resort fee. However, a cup of hot water costs $7 via room service is not cool. There was also NO mini-fridge, NO microwave, and NO coffee pot. 

Other Services: The valet is free and they work solely on tips so when you go give them a few bucks if they don't treat you like crap. They were nice to my wife and I.

Guest Services: So our adjoining neighbors decided to open their side of the door where we can hear everything they say. I called guest services and I believe I spoke with someone named John (I can't remember) who said, after treating me like a moron, that he would call. Well, we never heard their room phone ring and their side of the door stayed open. Every night we'd hear the neighbors yap it up and every morning hear the guy talk on his phone, ""Yeah man! I'm in Vegas! F'in this and F'in that man it's F'in great!"" Completely uncalled for. I was also told by GS that 80% of their rooms are adjoining. 

Please forgive me for being harsh, but I did pay money for this room and I expect to be respected.",1,0,0

We have been to Vegas many times before staying at places like Luxor, Monte Carlo, and Planet Hollywood. Flamingo was by far our worst experience yet. The check in line took 1 hour and 45 minutes to get through. When we asked the front agent for an explanation her response was ""We can't help that everyone wants to check in at the same time"". It was a very harsh response that made us feel like we did something wrong. Two of the three rooms were ok. One was much smaller than the others, had a tile in the bathroom missing, a cery very loud bathroom fan, and reeked of smoke in a non-smoking room. Be cautious when checking-in to make sure you are getting a standard room. We may not have known the difference if we didnt have two other rooms to compare it too. This shows there are rooms in the hotel that are much smaller and different despite being the same ""category"" room. Also you have to go through security to enter the pool, which took 20-30minutes each time. Not a downside to us but our experience with one of the security personell was upsetting. One of my friends jumped in the pool as a joke to get the others of us wet. It was met by 4 whistles and a lifeguard kindly explaining that was not allowed and we apologized. Within 30 seconds a secuirty officer was calling my friend over. She went on to say ""You have 30 minutes left until the pool closes to behave yourself. You do it again and youll be kicked our for tresspassing, fined, and kicked out of your room"". All 6 of us work shocked and the vulgar she had towards jumping in a pool. We called over another security officer to clarify the information and he said you get a warning or two before getting kicked out, however they can not fine you or kick you out of your room. It was sad that the one security person felt like they had to threaten us with false information isntead of just kindly informing us. We had never felt so unwelcomed at a hotel before and will be positive to stay elsewhere next time we are in Vegas!

First impressions were great, we attempted to use the self check in kiosk, with no luck as my guys ID is scuffed and the machine couldn't read it. An extremely nice older gentleman whose name escapes me was very helpful and sent us to the much shorter ""checkout line"" and said to use his name and they'll check us in. The woman who helped us was very informative, gave us information on near by clubs and pool party events. She also upgraded us to a remodeled room with a great view for no charge! Wow! Only thing she mentioned is the bathroom had not been re modeled. No biggie.

Got to our room no problem, the elevators were slow... Yet bare able I guess. Our king room was nicer than expected. Clean (no bed bugs btw. Always afraid I'm gonna get bed bugs.) Hardwood floor, great size flat screen, central a\/c, very spacious. I will say however, if you're the kind of person that has an eye for detail you probably won't be pleased. Mainly in the not remodeled bathroom. Yes the wall paper was peeling. Yes the tile was cracked. Yes the shower was cramped and tiny for my tall self and taller lover. The room was set to the lowest temperature however was never really cool. I broke a bit of a sweat in the middle of the night. Sure the halls smelled of marijuana occasionally but I hardly see how that's the hotels fault. 

My main issue with this hotel were the highly discussed elevators. I thought people were exaggerating when they complained about these but MY GOSH I'll tell you.. Once July 4th hit we were waiting more than THIRTY MINUTES for an elevator. You think I'm joking and I wish I was!! Every time an elevator came by it was packed like sardines!! When we finally were able to squeeze in one a half hour later, we were forced to stop at every. single. floor. on the way down. The elevator would ding and slide open to reveal bright excited faces of fellow travelers, only to quickly lose their smiles and switch to crushing disappointment after seeing there was no more room. About 15 floors of this. Over and over. I'm not kidding. It's because of this reason we probably won't be staying here again. Just much too inconvenient. 

The staff is absolutely wonderful and helpful.

The room was clean and nice for the most part.

Flamingo qualified, but isn't a very nice hotel, especially once you start walking around.  The casino floor is similar to Harrah's; is smoky; has a line at check in (at all times, I saw) - and for whatever reason the electronic check in machines don't work; and the pool was packed on Saturday, both the party pool and the family one.

The hotel room itself was nothing special.  Had an old style boxy TV and a king bed made up of two twins (with a King mattress on top).  The bathroom was old style and dark, it also didn't have a fan, causing me to think about mold growth... ick.  Oh, and the carpet was stained everywhere.  Really?

I stayed at the Flamingo Aug 5th-9th for my 21st birthday. What instigated me to write this review was the outstanding customer service I received from one of the front desk clerks, Jamison. My boyfriend and I walked up to check in and you could tell this employee absolutely loved his job (or was VERY job at pretending he did) either way, I have never received such phenomenal customer service. He was so friendly, knowledgeable, and truly went above and beyond for us. He made sure all of our friends that were staying at the Flamingo as well were on the same floor as us, explained the bill precisely and thoroughly, and just made our check in as fast and easy as possible.  We were lucky enough to have Jamison again to check us out of our hotel and again, he made it a very fast and easy process. He even allowed us to keep our keys so we could hang out by the pool to kill time before our late flight.  I really hope someone above Jamison sees this review and can acknowledge what an exceptional employee they have. I stayed in the Fab Room: High Roller view and was very satisfied, big room with an awesome view. The hotel itself is very fun with a lot of great restaurants and bars, and very convenient location right in the middle of the strip.

The rooms seem very nice at first, but the more time you spend in them, the more you realize that details have been overlooked.  Although a recent renovation has certainly freshened up the rooms (keep in my that I have no idea what it looked like before the renovation), it appears to be more like someone slapped a band-aid haphazardously onto a wound.  A lot of the hardware is outdated and damaged.  For example, the faucet was displaying signs of advanced rust, there were unpatched cracks in the walls, and the bathtub was missing a stopper.  The carpet in the hallway was coming up and a metal covering on the ceiling and floor had become partially unscrewed.

The actual casino and accompanying grounds had little to offer beyond really cheap shopping and a passable food court.  It looked dated for sure, but was not falling apart.  The tables are lower priced than many nearby casinos.  The pool was the nicest thing.  I loved the shady grotto.

Honestly, if you're staying here, it's for the low price.  Other than that, I wouldn't bother.",4,1,0

The basic deluxe rooms are pretty dated, but if you stay in a GO room your Vegas vacation will be worthwhile. We don't really hang out in the room, so I can't be too critical but everything is pink and white, which my friends and I have always enjoyed. The pool is pretty fun but you can definitely do better in Vegas (hint hint Mandalay Bay).  My worst stay here involved them booking us in a room that had already been occupied!!! We literally walked into a room filled with stuff and people and felt awful for them!  We were relocated to a different room, but for some reason, housekeeping bothered us to clean the room at 3:00 in the morning!!! What? Unheard of. I know some people aren't in their rooms at 3am in Vegas, but we happened to be that night, and we were rudely awakened. Not cool.  

On the other hand, the GO room has an amazing view of the pool or the Bellagio fountains.  Also, newly remodeled Margaritaville is worth walking through. You'll feel like you're on vacay walking through the tropical decor and taking whiffs of amazing coconut.

The pillows were way too fluffy and had to sleep on the bed without one :\/ Also. the last day we were there house keeping came into our room without even knocking so not really happy about that. 

The location of this hotel is awesome and right in the middle of the strip. They recently renovated the hotel so it has a food court and a mexican restaurant. The food was ok but of course pricey. The buffet was also alright. 

The line for the pool on saturday was ridiculous and every day we were there (wednesday-sunday) we couldn't find a place to put our towels so had to keep our stuff next to us on the floor and sit in the pool which was ok. It got packed on the weekends. The drinks were expensive by the pool.

The part I was really annoyed with was the parking. We tried to park saturday night and half the parking lot is for valet while the other half is for the hilton guests and trying to get around in that parking lot is a nightmare. Also, valet was lined up that night and was told we'd have to wait for valet... well isn't that the point of having a valet so you don't have to wait?

Margaritaville: A nice restaurant with an upper deck view

The staff: very nice, polite
Cons: This hotel reeks of smoke, everywhere,  I used to smoke, so I understand and am not condemning. But when you ask for a non-smoking room, it should not smell like someone has nuck into your room and is hiding to smoke a cigarette. This resulted in a miserable stay (allergies). 
If you are catching an airport shuttle in, you will have to walk a block with your baggage to the hotel, back entrance, 
There was a roach near the ice machine--but this may be secondary to the fact that someone dumped a salad on the floor, and it sat there for two days--after all, natural selection dictates that you need to do what you can to survive--and this roach was doing what he could to get to that salad.

It's pretty decent for the price you pay. Located in about the middle of the strip. I noticed that not a lot of young people stayed at this place (Go figure, haha) since it's one of the older hotels. One of the lights wasn't working in our room and we had requested for maintenance to check it out but they never did, haha. I'd definitely stay here again though if I want to stay on a budget but still stay in a decent room.

The room was so clean.  Carpet, free of dirt?  Check.  Bedsheets, pure cleanly white?  Check.  Bathroom, free of dust, fingerprints, etc.?  Check.  View?  Fantastic.  We were on the 28th floor, right over the garden they have in the back with the flamingos and birds and koi fish and what-not.

The prime showcase of the room?  The bathroom.  It didn't have walls, it had thick white panes of glass.  The pink walls matched the pink light that lit up the white glass.  The sink was one of those bowl sinks.  The shower was pretty nice too, except the water was definitely not hot enough for me.  I had to take fast showers if I didn't want to freeze to death.

That's 5 months ago! We are here for the Marine Ball and refused to give our rooms. We had paid since June. So they refused because my fiancé and I are not 21 yet. If they knew we weren't 21 why in the hell would they accept my money for reservation. We had paid in full. So i asked for management and a young lady (who I asked if she was the manager) approached me and i told her what had happened, she right away came at my fiance and I with a Strong and unnecessary attitude and refused to give my money back. So, my fiance and i decide to leave and find another hotel, we ask valet for my car and as im getting inside my vehicle, the valet guy without me even giving him the chance to tip yet says... ""just so you know, there is self-parking"" and walked away. First time coming to Flamingo hotel & casino and it will absolutely be the last time we EVER come to this hotel.

They told us that we will get a new room in the morning. 

3\/28\/15: Moved to the new room with 2 beds this time and one of my friends wanted to shower and guess what? The shower head was broken... Called the front desk and someone came up and gave us an upgrade to a better room. 

Later on that evening when we were getting ready to walk the strip we noticed that someone was at the front unlocking the room into our hotel when we were all in the hotel already. Turns out another family had the same key card and the same room as us. We didn't want our belongings to get stolen so we called the front desk and they told us they would check it out. 

Couple of hours later another family unlocked our door and came into our room... We called the front desk again and this time they changed the codes on the keycard. Turns out the room that we were in that was upgraded had nobody booked inside it so the front desk kept sending random families into our room. 

This maybe the worse hotel I've ever stayed at. Ruined a couple of our weekends due to always having one person stay in the hotel room so our belongings weren't stolen...

They did a great job capturing that ""old Vegas"" feeling while keeping everything modern and sleek- Bravo Flamingo!

The new GO rooms are fabulous. They feel fun and sexy but aren't too cramped like the ""sexy"" updated rooms at the MGM (My closet is bigger than your rooms MGM- what the H?) I do not like that you can't lock the bathroom doors which are only frosted so you can still see silhouettes through it. No privacy whatsoever there so I do not recommend sharing a room with friends or a partner who you're not comfortable knowing every bit of bathroom business they do- yeah you can also totally hear everything in there since it's just a slim sliding door with no seals on the top or bottom. 
BUT- if you're like me and my husband who don't give a hoot then you'll be right at home here! But if your home was a fancy luxurious hotel room you never had to clean.

They have also extended Margaritaville into their own cute island-y casino on the side of the building. I know it's silly and kitschy but I LOVE LOVE LOVE Margaritaville! They are so smooth and icy cold that they just melt in your mouth like buttah. Perfection!


Good job for keeping up with the times Flamingo! Staying here is not only more affordable than the newer hotel\/casinos neighboring it who are trying to recover some of the billions they spent on their launch, but you will feel just as fancy and hip as if you were at the Cromwell or the Linq (don't stay at the Linq- yuck!) and know that you are in the hands of the only classic Vegas joint left on the strip.

CHECK-IN\/FRONT DESK - 5 Stars
Our flight landed at McCarran at 7:30am local time, so we were at the Flamingo by 8:15 with probably no chance of our rooms being ready.  However, we decided to check an.  The lady at the front desk was very polite, and offered to have us 'automatically' checked in as soon as our room was available.  She advised us to return to the front desk anytime after 2pm to pick up our room keys, which was nice because this was a separate line from check-in.  So upon returning approx 3pm, I waited a minute or two in a very short short 'keys only' line, picked up our room keys and I was on my way.

HOTEL ROOM - 2 Stars
FYI, we did not stay in an upgraded 'GO' room. For the most part, the room was nice and probably should get 3 to 3.5 stars, but since the bathroom seemed really outdated and was obviously not re-done with the room itself, I'm unfortunately giving it only 2 stars.  As for the beds, desk, misc. furniture and the TV, those all seemed pretty nice, and the floor was not carpeting which took me by surprise.  It was actually a fake wood (laminate?), which seems to be easier for cleaning purposes.  ON A SIDE NOTE:  The corridors\/hallways and elevators in our tower were really, really really outdated and need to be upgraded badly.

CASINO - 4 Stars
FYI, I'm including the Margaritaville Casino in with this review.  Overall the casino is nice, and you have the infamous 'Flamingo' fragrance that is always pumped throughout the casino, which I actually like.  You can usually find lower table limits here compared to Caesars across the street or the Cromwell next door.  There are always $5 blackjack tables inside Margaritaville and the main Flamingo casino itself has a variety of table games with lower limits, even on the weekends and in the evenings.  Also have a variety of slot machines, which I like as well.  While the decor in the casino may seem 'outdated', I don't think it really is.  It still has that vintage Vegas feel and look to it.

DINING - 2 Stars
Ok, this is where the Flamingo could step up it's game a bit.  Carlos' and Charlie's is a smaller chain and not unique to Vegas so I've opted to steer away from there.  The Buffet could use some work as well.  Went there for breakfast twice on my past two visits and it was not good at all.  The selection was very limited (didn't even have pancakes) and the food wasn't the best of quality.  Want a better buffet?  Check out Harrah's down the street.  And as for the Cafe' at the Flamingo, I've eaten here once and the service was horrible and the food was very bland and tasteless and took forever to come out.  Even if I stay at the Flamingo again, I will not be dining here.

BARS -  4 Stars  
Ok, for starters the casino bars are average, just a few bars in the middle of the casino.  But what I do like to give this area 4 stars is Margaritaville, the 5 O'Clock Somewhere Bar inside the Margaritaville Casino, and the Corner Bar which is located outside on the southwest corner of the building (right by the Cromwell casino entrance).  The corner bar offers up $3 Miller Lite Pints everyday (16oz aluminum cans), all day, which is really cheap on the strip now that Bill's and the original O'Shea's are gone.  Not a lot of nightlife here, but The Flamingo does have a few good spots to grab a drink. 

SPORTS BOOK -  2 Stars  
The Sports Book at the Flamingo is really small and sits next to Carlos' and Charlie's.  Definately not one of the Sports Books I would prefer to catch a game in.  While it's clean and looks decent, I would just prefer a larger sports book such as the one at TI, The Mirage or my favorite, Caesars Palace.

POOL - 5 Stars
Ok, behind The Mirage and Caesars, The Flamingo has my third favorite pool in Vegas.  I especially like that they have an over 21 pool where no kids are allowed.  And the partying doesn't kick in until later in the afternoon, so if you want a nice relaxing swim without kicking and screaming kids, head to the Flamingo Go Pool.  The family pool is also nice with a few small water slides added to it.

STAFF - 5 Stars
Overall, the staff in general (front desk, casino, restaurant\/bars, housekeeping) are great and deserve 5 stars.",4,1,0

The hotel has all the facilities you would need - bars, restaurants, beauticians, hair dressers (beware of their prices though!!!).

The rooms are not great, the service is pretty poor, and getting what you want requires some work.  If you begin your stay with this in mind, you can make the most of your time.  

First, go for the room upgrade.  Do not stay in the ""FAB"" rooms, they are far from it.  Instead opt for the ""GO"" rooms.  I was able to use the ""sandwich"" to upgrade my room.  Here you place a $20 in between your ID and credit card and ask the individual at the front desk if there are any courtesy upgrades.  Sometimes they bite, and sometimes they don't.  If they don't bite, ask if they can come down at all on the price of the upgrade and they usually will.  Either way, don't stay in a FAB room.

Second, the pool requires some maneuvering.   There are two pools, located near each other.  One pool is family friendly.  I did not go to this pool so I cannot say much about it.  The other pool is 21 and over.  Starting at 7:00 AM there will be a line to enter this pool.  They check your ID, and sometimes your room key (seems like on the weekend is the only time they check the room key).  You get a wrist band that is good for all day, and they check your bag for any alcohol or food which are both prohibited since they want you to purchase your food and alcohol from the vendor at the pool.  While I was there, I entered the pool around 8:00 and was able to find a chair with some effort.  I then placed a towel and a t-shirt on the chairs to save my spot and then went back to my room to start my day.  I was able to come back to my place later on.  There are not nearly enough chairs for all of the people at the pool, so you have to save a spot early if you want one.  There are also day beds and cabanas available.  The day beds go for $120 and includes 2 drinks during weekdays, and $220 for weekends.  I did not ask about cabanas because the day bed price was already higher than I was willing to pay.  

The pool plays club\/hip hop music all day, they do a ""bootie-shaking"" contest around 3:00 daily, and there are a few gambling tables.  The alcohol specials seems to consistently be a bucket of beer (six) for $25, or (12) for $48.  Even though this may seem to be for people only 21-35, I saw people of all ages everyday I was there.  The majority of the people there are not your crust of society, so if you prefer to be around a higher-class clientele, you may want to check out another pool.  Flamingo is partnered with Ballys and Ceasars and you can utilize some of those resort amenities for a discounted price.  

Third, customer service is practically non-existent.  You will wait and the employees will be rude and that is the status quo.  Check in and out are both nightmarish because of ridiculously long lines.  I suggest checking in at an odd hour (I did an 8:00 PM check in to avoid lines), and I suggest settling your bill before hand and checking out by calling the front desk at 11:00 AM and leaving the keys in your room.  

If you need anything during your stay, do not expect to get it.  Extra towels?  Go find a cart and steal them.  Need help using the ipod dock?  Forget it.  Nothing will be delivered to your room, and no one will be able to answer your questions.  In addition, they will probably be rude that you even asked a question to begin with.  Save yourself the disappointment and stress and just figure it out yourself.  

The upside of the Flamingo is the location.  It is directly across the street from Ceasar's and generally in the middle of the strip.  Also, it has a monorail stop.  The monorail runs on one side of the strip and is great for getting around.  It is $5 for one trip, or $12 for the day.  Being centrally located, and having the monorail is very convenient and probably the main selling point of the Flamingo.",0,0,0

We made a recent trip from December 13-15, 2013 and we decided to stay at the Flamingo. One we decided to stay there because of location and two because we were going to stay there again at the end of December. We arrived at the hotel to find the valet full, so we self parked where parking was impossible because half the structure is closed off for valet purposes, which I did not understand that the areas that were closed off were empty and valet stated it was full. Next, we checked in and got our keys, walked all the way to our room in the Habitat tower, where the carpet in the hallways were in disrepair, walked to our room which was 71 where it was down two long corridors to get to and only to find out that the keys did not work, and they were not stuck into a wallet or purse to be demagnetized. Had to walk back to the front desk to get new keys and walk all the way back. Once in the room, we find out the heater was not working and there was no TV remote. We called and waited over an hour and half for a remote to arrive, and the repairman did not arrive till the next morning around 1030. The repairman did state that he needed parts and had to leave and would be back, we ask if we needed to stay and he stated no. When we arrived back to the room later that day, we found out the heater did not work still, and called to get no repairman visit and no working heater for the rest of our stay. Meanwhile, we had also found out we were being double charged for our room since we had already paid for it through Priceline. We went to the front desk on December 14, in the morning, and talked with Emilio from Managua, Nicaragua. He was very rude and uninterested in explaining or looking into any reason why we were charged extra. Also, the first receipt we had received showed that we were charged one price, yet on our card statement, it showed a different price. After several questions and showing Emilio our online statement from our card, he looked into it and stated that the first charge was a mistake and gave us another printout showing we will be charged the other charge. As for being charged double, he stated for us to contact Priceline. Once talking with Priceline, stating they needed to talk with someone from the hotel, Emilio stated that he could not do anything further and that they needed to call the general number. Also, while standing there talking with Emilio, two female customers approached where we were standing and started talking with Emilio. He decided to carry on a conversation with them and not having them wait until he was finished with us. Once he was done talking with these women, his attitude changed and came back to poorly addressing our situation. Once off the phone with Priceline, and after being rudely treated by Emilio with his poor attitude, we asked to speak with a manager. Emilio turned around and walked past his manager, who was standing at the computer which sits off the front desk, and went into the back. I walked over to the area where the manager was standing and asked if he was the manager, he acknowledge, and I proceeded to tell him about Emilio's bad attitude and unwillingness to help. The manager stated that Emilio went on break and that he never gets complaints about Emilio. I am not sure if customer service is key in your hotel, but it is not with Emilio or the manager. We left very unhappy with that experience. However, later on that day, we talked with Priceline, and they stated that we needed to talk to the hotel because they were unsuccessful in getting through. We again approached the front desk, the same as earlier. We let the people behind us go first, so we did not get Emilio again, and we were greeted by a very friendly representative named Jennifer from Yorba Linda, CA. We explained our situation and she looked at our statement and looked into the hotel records and gladly worked through the problem and found what happened and what went wrong. She explained everything thoroughly what happened and how it will be fixed. She was very pleasant and she should be recognized for listening, working with the customer, taking extra time to look at things, not be narrow-minded, being polite and pleasant, and customer satisfaction( nothing Emilio displayed or even attempted to).",1,0,0

So here goes the novel that is my review. We booked because our friends said they had stayed there and wanted to again now that it's been redone. We arrived, took 30 minutes to find parking. Check in not realizing our luggage was in a puddle. Even though I had booked on their site and had been charged they claimed there was a rate adjustment and the room was now more expensive. Off to a bad start but who cares, I'm in vegas for a week! Up we go to our room. I tripped over the carpet in the hallway. It was threadbare in areas, covered in stains and pulling up from the ground. I said ""This carpet is..."" and before I could finish a passing guest said ""disgusting...that's what the carpet is."" We open our non smoking room to a big face slap of cigarette smell. Again, it's Vegas...oh well. Our view was a parking lot and construction. I am horrified of bed bugs and have my ritual. No luggage touches the bed and nothing happens until I do my mandatory inspection. The bed is white and there are specs of brown and tan (like sand and dirt) near the foot. There is also a dead brown bug. I try to move the bug onto something so I can look at it and it drops onto the carpet. My boyfriend tells me I am paranoid and I agree. So I pull all the sheets up off of the foot of the bed to start my check and before I can do anything...BAM bed bug just crawling around doing it's thing. If you know about bed bugs...those are all signs of a set in...well feed...long lived...full blown infestation. The poop, the completed life cycle and a bed bug so big that you can easily see it...in the middle of that day?! They normally stay out of site until around 3 am. I flipped out, video taped the bug, made him get a cup to bring the bug to the lobby in and held all my luggage while I called the lobby. Saying bed bug, video and ""it's in a cup"" should get you straight through to a manager yes? Not at the flamingo. I had to ask for a manager. The manager asked if we would like a cleaning lady. uh huh. I told her I was coming straight to the lobby bed bug in hand. I get there, put the cup on the counter and loudly say ""we found bed bugs in our room"". She offers to put us in a different room. I tell her that since the linens are cleaned together and the guests use the same towels, wear their now bed bug infested clothes around the hotel..etc that the whole place is unsafe and I want to be put in a different hotel. Remember our friends are staying there too. She tells me she will refund my money and allow me to use their phone to reserve elsewhere. I tell her that Bed Bugs are a big deal and have to make a huge scene and threaten to tell everyone waiting to check in (and show them) before she finally calls Planet Hollywood and reserves for us. She hangs up the phone and tells us that it will be more expensive. Again, I have to make her call them back and get the exact same rate that we would have been paying at the flamingo. Finally this manager says to me ""You know, there are bed bugs everywhere"" Which disgusted me even more...No..not every hotel has bed bugs. They use bed bugs protectors on their mattresses (unlike the Flamingo) and use high heat in their dryers. So...2 hours later we are finally in line to register at PH. The lady that checks us in is so disgusted that she immediately upgrades us to a mini-suite overlooking the bellagio water show and the pools. No bed bugs, nice clean beds and beautiful rooms. So our friends say they want to leave too and expect the same deal. Flamingo tells them to drive to PH and if they have availability that Flamingo would refund them. They get to PH, no one from Flamingo has contacted them and they see that Flamingo booked and then immediately canceled a room with PH. Thank God for PH because we went to the same lady, she got on the phone with Flamingo, which is a sister hotel of PH, and got our friends the exact same deal one floor above us. Flamingo is SICK and their customer relations are atrocious. Go look at trip adviser...everyone says the same thing. And unless you want your world to be rocked by a bed bug infestation...STAY AWAY",1,0,0

Anyway, I had picked the Flamingo because of its vicinity to so many other strip attractions and yet rooms are so much less than surrounding hotels, minus Ballys and the Quad. I had been planning this trip for over 6 months and am not going to lie, some of the reviews here had me super worried....thankfully that was not the case and I have nothing but good things to say about my stay!

We arrived at 11am on a Friday...check in isn't until 4pm unless you want to pay a fee. I had already joined their Total Rewards program at home and printed our temp cards so we went to get the real cards at the TR booth and found out TR members can check in early at no charge...at noon! It wasn't quite noon but there was only one person in the TR guest line so we gave it a go. At that time we were able to take care of everything but had to come back to get the keys at 12. Piece of cake! The guy that helped us was awesome... Removed the resort fee for me since I had booked back in February but had changed to a better packed after they started the resort fee (on his own, I didn't even ask), gave us some tips on ways to get around quick and was super friendly and fast. 

Our GO room was really cute and clean with a view of the pools. We were on the 25th floor of the Spa Tower. I was excited it had a mini fridge and a coffee maker...nice to have cold water available and store left overs to eat for breakfast. The bed was super comfy, there's a huge mirror for getting ready and lots of lights in the bathroom. We had no problems at all with the room, keys or house keeping during our stay.

Some tips....the coffee place in the hotel sucks and was way overpriced. Maybe we are Starbucks snobs, but really, yuck. None of the restaurants here were impressive, but like I said, it's in the perfect spot to walk to better restaurants. Serendipity across the street is FABULOUS! 

If you hit the GO pool go early if you want a lounge chair. They open at 9 and there will be a line to get in.  The party goes all day here...if you want beer buy a bucket before noon and save your self 10 bucks! The pool food was pretty good too. 

My only 2 complaints were 1. Who ever had the room before us thought it'd be great fun to set the clock radio alarm for 2 am, full blast on static. Yes it's Vegas and yes I was asleep at 2 am and that really, really sucked. 2. The iPod docking stations are great, until you are awakened by a ridiculous alarm at 2 am and then forced to hear the base of your neighbors techno music til 4 am. Not the hotel's fault some people are inconsiderate...maybe if I'd had some good coffee I'd not be so grumpy about it. 

Check out was easy. I went down early (10am) to pay my pool tab and took care of everything in about 5 min. Was told to leave the keys in the room and that was it. I vote stay here. You'll be close to it all and save money for fun on the strip...winning!",8,4,3

The resort fee is outlandish.  It gives you free local call, two passes to the gym and ONE device to use on the wireless internet.  If you want to use more than one it will be 13.99 per device.

I checked in online as the hotel sent me a link that it would be faster.  However this caused me to have extra charges on my account.  When I called the front desk about it, the office manager insisted I was wrong and said I could come down to the desk and she would call the bank.  When I came down to the front desk, the clerk saw the error right away and said I was dually charged because of the online check in and again when I actually picked up the keys.  I said, ""so you'll take it of?""  I was told I could call the bank to see if they knew what to do to reverse it otherwise it would occur in five business days.

No one apologized for the error and I left in frustration.  I will not be returning and would recommend others not to go here.",0,0,0

There I said it. With all the things that kids have in the world (Disneyland, playing consoles, smart phones, etc.) adults need to have their own playpen. People say I'm an old soul. I like the Vegas of old - a swinging town dominated by gamblers. Even though there are more visitors in Vegas, Macau has become what Vegas was -  the gambling capital of the world. People say the Flamingo is run down. To that I would respond is that if it wasn't for the Flamingo the Las Vegas Strip that we know today wouldn't have existed. The Flamingo isn't kid friendly but if you want that then go to Circus Circus. Let's be honest casinos like Circus Circus wouldn't have made what The Strip is today. The Flamingo represents a lot of history through good times (Rat Pack) and bad times (mob). There's a certain character the Flamingo that exhibits through this day. My favorite old time Vegas movie is the original ""Ocean's 11"" in 1960. Of all the hotels featured in that movie Flamingo is the only remaining.

During the Presidents' Day Weekend my friend and me stayed here for 3 days. I never stayed at the Flamingo before. My original review of the Flamingo was a 5-star rating because I won over $700 about 2 years ago that paid off my Vegas trip. When we arrived this past Thursday there was a long line in the check in line. However there was no line at the Total Rewards Gold Member line. Being a Total Rewards Gold Member I went to that line to quickly check in. (Here's a tip be a Total Rewards Member so you don't have to wait for a long line at the regular check in.) 

We stayed at the Go Room. This room represents a modern feel that includes a 42"" HD TV and a TV in the bathroom. One of the features I love about the Flamingo is the layout of the casino itself. Even though the casino is smaller than most casinos all the gaming activities are centralized and not spread out as some casinos in The Strip. This makes people gamble more. Another great feature is the garden that includes a wedding chapel and swimming pools. Unfortunately the swimming pools were closed due to renovations. 

You might ask if I love the Flamingo so much then why on my updated review I didn't give a 5-star rating this time? Two years ago I stayed at the Roman Tower at Caesars Palace. That room at Caesars was twice as spacious than at the Go Room of the Flamingo even though I paid a little more at Caesars. That was the only knock on the Flamingo. 

The Flamingo remains a gambling playpen for those adults who want to relive the Old Vegas the without the hassle of a kid friendly atmosphere.",7,2,6

This time around, it was no different, the place needs some serious repairs, but for the price on the strip, ehh. Staying at the Flamingo is always a gamble like everything else in Vegas. Sometimes you get a good room and sometimes the room gets you.

The problem was that my car was broken into, everything of importance was stolen, I talked to security, of course, no camera's, the hotel told me they wouldn't be able to do anything and after being in there for 2 hours. You could have saved me the trouble and told me to contact Las Vegas M.P.D.

this happened on 4\/20 - 4\/21, so  when I went to LVMPD. Guess what, I was told that many police officers had ""called in"" on 4\/21 and where short staffed... Ohhh Vegas... that's why I love you, the Devil's Taint doesn't disappoint.

I was a bit apprehensive after booking and THEN reading Yelp reviews...there seems to be a black & white feeling about this place, no grey area at all.  Love it or hate it... I will summarize what I loved and hated about this place.

Love!
We got in around noon, and I knew check in was at 4.  I called in advance and asked what the early check in process was.  I was told it depended on the day, situation,etc.  basically, you won't know till you get there.  We stood in a short line and Jamison waited on us... he is THE MAN!!!! Seriously... after asking about upgrades and early check in, we were able to check into an upgraded room on the 28th floor with a strip view for $20 more a night along with a coffee maker and fridge as well.  So Happy!
The location is ideal if you don't plan on spending much time in your room.

As time went on...

Hate....
Ok, the elevators... I had no idea what to expect after reading about the problematic nightmares till I experienced this myself.  Also, I might add this was EDC weekend which only added to the nightmare.  Having a top floor room was amazing....the ride up or down to it, not so much!!!  This elevator would stop on floors with no one there, the doors would remain open, or closed... just ridiculous!  Plus, I don't think they were all working.  I'm referring to the Habitat Doors.   I'm not sure if the Spa Elevators had the same problem.

After spending the night, the next day our room was never cleaned.  We noticed that the cleaning people were still on our floor, yet no one cleaned our room.  We called housekeeping and they assured us it would be clean.  Nope... and that meant a shortage for three of us to share towels for two.

Be prepared for Wyndham time share people to corner you everywhere...they are by the elevators and the check in desk - just ignore them and keep walking, they are VERY annoying!!! I don't recall getting bothered by these types at any other hotel I stayed at.

If you want a seat at the 21 & over Go Pool, be sure to stand in line well before 9am...by 9:15 there is a long line and NO seats in the place.  There is a nice money making thing going on in here where there are less chairs and more day beds to rent for $100\/day plus you need to spend at least $50 there on drinks.  Needless to say we spent time at the FREE Family pool with plenty of seats and no line to get in.  Also keep in mind it was this way during the week, I can't imagine what the weekend would be like.

I haven't sorted through our final bill yet, but I will say the resort fee here is a joke too.

The regular rooms aren't terrible, but they're not much cheaper than the GO rooms and there is a BIG DIFFERENCE between the two rooms. We took to Twitter for a coupon code, and they gave us a code that let us upgrade for $20 each night.

The GO room is excellent. It has a big flat screen TV, great bed, a TV in the bathroom mirror, both a shower and tub, a nice lounge chair in front of the big window, a great closet and everything is pristine and clean. I can't express how much happier you'll be with a GO room. And for $65 a night during the week, you really can't beat it.

The location is great. It's across the street from the Bellagio (see the water show outside every half hour) and Caesars Palace. Behind it is this neat little Italian joint (not fancy, just fun) called Battistas that gives you free unlimited wine with your meal and a guy with an accordion who comes around playing to all the tables.

The outdoor area is huge, which I love. They have a lot of land here. The pool area is HUGE, they must have at least five pools. They also have a little area with real Flamingos (which were freezing their patooties off while we were here) and there's plenty of places to walk around and explore in a semi-quiet environment.

My only complaint is the lack of good food. The Burger Joint makes a decent greasy breakfast, but the rest of the food is crap. Sin City Brewing company is the biggest highlight only because they have a fire pit out back.

As for the Casino... it's OK. There's nothing spectacular about it except that there are dancing girls in one corner on a little stage every once in a while. The fifty year old boob-implanted waitresses are few and far between and I wasn't offered a drink even once despite the amount of time I spent in here one night.

So as far a Casino goes... go next door to Bills Gambling Hall for some fun. If you want a good place to stay, I have to thank the numerous people who told me to stay here because the GO rooms make me feel like I'm staying at the Bellagio, but just a little more pink.",4,1,2

The price was quite reasonable (I booked a Black Friday special on the Flamingo website).  The location is great!  The grounds are nice, with a wildlife refuge complete with birds, koi ponds and more.  We got to the hotel a couple of hours before the 4 PM check in.  We were allowed to check in early (for a $15.00 fee)... Our room had a fabulous view of the new Ferris wheel and the animal refuge.  And the room is nicely updated.  Sadly, the bathroom had rusty drains and BUGS (ants?) in the shower.  Yuck.  The hallways were DISGUSTING!  Carpet was dirty and in desperate need of a stretching.  It is a trip hazard!  Tears and huge waves of wrinkles.  Also, be wary of anything promised to you before your arrival.  We called to request a fridge (they were able to deliver on this) and a coffee pot.  Due to a special diet, I need hot water.  We called before our trip to request this.  Once there we were told we had to be in the ""Gold Tower"" (at an additional charge) in order to have a coffee pot.  Since we drove, I would have brought my own but did not as we were assured we could have one.  I was on at least 2 (Habitat) elevators that did not work.  As for the casino, on three occasions we were at slots for 30 + minutes and NEVER had drink service.  The ""free"" parking is great if you can find a spot.  The first day we were fine.  The second day (after returning from a hike) the parking garage AND the Valet were both full.  On our last morning, we (reluctantly) went to one of the hotel restaurants for breakfast.  Again, dirty carpet (yuck...in a restaurant I'd like to see some cleanliness).  I ordered the french toast (quite a treat for me as I usually do not eat this).  It looked lovely!  Lots of fresh berries, three thick slices of french toast.  I poured a little syrup on one piece.  Had a few bites, poured more syrup on and YUCK!!!!  an empty wrapper from  sweetener poured onto my toast.  It took about 8-10 minutes to find our waitress.

Because of the poor expectations, I really feel compelled to share my experience at the Flamingo the last few days and address the ""issues"" that were brought to our attention while reading reviews on this and other forums.

We booked this trip to join some friends of ours that had gotten an excellent deal on flights\/rooms and they asked us and another couple to join them about a month after they had booked themselves. I had never stayed at the Flamingo but we booked the cheap Fab King rooms because we hadn't really budgeted for this trip. Our reservation didn't allow for cancellations because of the low rate and our upgrade offer (about a week from the trip) was just too much to justify in our eyes.

My wife was very apprehensive because she read many reviews was really buying into the horror stories of the condition of the rooms, rude staff, pushy timeshare salespeople, etc... When we arrived, we inquired about an upgrade but they didn't have any available unless we wanted to change rooms during the stay which we declined. We were placed on the 16th floor with a partial strip view. When we got to our room and it was the closest room to the elevators and there was a sign stating it was a dog accessible room so my wife was really irritated before we entered the room thinking of the noise at the elevator and dog hair\/mess potential (and we are dog lovers). To our surprise, the room was clean and nice and we barely ever heard a noise from the elevator area. We examined for bed bugs, pet stains, pet hair, etc... and found NOTHING wrong with our room. This room was basically like staying in a newer LaQuinta IMO. The mattress was firm, but comfortable. The pillows were a little firmer than we prefer, but they were completely fine. The bathroom was a little dinged up but again, completely fine. Our water pressure in the shower was excellent and not shortage of hot water. We were greeted by timeshare people about once a day as we walked through the lobby but they were not pushy and all we did was smile and say ""no thank you"" and they left us alone.

The pool was fun. Drink prices were a little higher than other places but it is what it is. They searched my wife's bag and asked me to empty my swim trunk pockets (had my phone and wallet in them) and they checked our ID. 1 morning they allowed coffee into the pool area and another morning they didn't so it depends on the person at the gate. I found the security people to be pretty friendly but we are polite people so that probably helps. The line did start forming at 8:15, but I am talking 2-4 people. By about 8:30 there were 15-20 people and if you were in line by about 8:45 you were able to get multiple chairs together still and I would say there were about 30-45 people in line at that time. We were able to get 6 chairs together in several locations and we were in line at 8:30AM. If you are a diamond or above player, you have a separate line so you can get there at 9AM and have your pick of chairs. It was the same each day (Monday-Thurs mornings) so I bet the weekends are a little tougher.

We were greeted by timeshare people about once a day as we walked through the lobby but they were not pushy and all we did was smile and say ""no thank you"" and they left us alone. This wasn't even an inconvenience to us. It was WAY less intrusive than the guys on the strip pushing their bars\/clubs\/events.

Honestly, we enjoyed our stay so much that we will be looking to stay there again in the future if the price is right. I preferred my room at MGM and love their pool options, but the location of the Flamingo and price is really hard to beat. We may have just gotten lucky by having one of the better Fab Rooms or it is just that we don't expect to receive a suite on a super 8 budget....

Upon arrival the check-in went quick and smooth, but the room assigned us was really nasty.  Dirty and dingy.  Not ""Deluxe"" at all.  Hotel says the Deluxe room is distinguished from the Classic by the decor.  I can't even imagine what kind of craphole a Classic room must be.

Request for room change was quickly satisfied, but the next room (nonsmoking) reeked of smoke.  Again, sincere apologies and request for room change was quickly satisfied.  The room shared many characteristics of the other rooms, namely the ""decor"", and was slightly cleaner and was acceptable to us.  Kudos for being responsive, but WTF?

Maybe it was out fault for not upgrading to a ""GO"" room.  Next time, if there is a next time... it's a GO room or another hotel!

Odd observation:  ther appears to be a lack of standards for how the 
rooms are stocked.  One room has 3 pillows on one queen bed and 2 on the other.  A single shampoo\/conditioner.  Maybe that works for a bunch of guys, but not for a family with girls!  The room we settled into with two queen beds only had 3 towels.

We asked for more towels, telling them that there were 4 of us in the room, and within 15 minutes a smiling man appeared with a sack of toiletries (4 of everything, I think), 4 bath towels, 4 hand towels, 4 wash cloths, a box of tissues and a spare roll of toilet paper.  WOW... more kudos for being responsive.  Unfortunately the next day we were only resupplied with 3 towels.

My heart almost stopped, though, when my young son started pulling stuff out from under the bed.  First it was a half-used bottle of lotion, then a half-drunk bottle of water, and then I pulled him out for rear of what might be found next.  ATTENTION HOUSEKEEPING: When, or if, you vacuum the carpet please check under the beds for whatever the prior occupant may have left behind!

Nice surprise... no ""resort fee"".  Pool(s) and habitat area are very nice.  We didn't have time to use them as much as I would have like to.  Slightly odd pool hours: 8 AM - 6 PM.  No evening swimming????

Lobby and casino are inviting.  Not the newest or most glamorous, but still quite nice.

Good variety of eating options.

And then it was check-out time.  Given a choice between a line of people waiting to check out and a self-serve checkout machine, we chose the machine.  Quite anti-social of us, eh... but whatev!

There is a bank of about 6 machines and as we walked up someone was walkling away shaking her head.  Not knowing, we read the directions: swipe credit card or ""Total Rewards"" card.  So we swiped the pretty gold card that served as our room key, which had boldy emblazoned upon it ""Total Rewards (italics and fancy script lettering) GOLD""  The machine kept giving a message... something like ""I have no idea who you are"".  At the next machine over there was an employee training a presumably new employee on how the machines work.  When they finished we asked if they could explain what we were doing wrong.  No she couldn't... she's a trainer and would have to call an ""Ambassador"".  So we stood by for a few minutes wondering why she couldn't tell us how to work the machine, but she could tell a new employee how the machine works.  Perhaps union rules... who knows.

Well, then a very mature, tall, hansome and well-spoke gentleman approached us and informed us that the card we were using is a room key and we should be using a credit card.  Then the system would search based on our name.  When we pointed out the instructions and showed him the ""Total Rewards Gold"" on the room key, he smiled and asked us to swipe a credit card.  We did, the machine printed a receipt, the nice gentleman handed it to us and bid us adieu and a nice day.  Kudos!

... but do we have a Total Rewards card, or just an old room key?",2,0,0

Prior to arriving at the hotel, we had read reviews about the Flamingo to discover the hotel booked through Expedia described as FAB Deluxe, is not actually deluxe at all.  We called Expedia to change our reservation and they made a note on our account addressing our concerns.  When we checked into the hotel, the people at the front desk made it sound like he was ""hooking us up"" by giving us a strip view, and not charging us additional money.  Once we arrived in our room, we discovered the room was in need of much work.  The windows were hard to see through because they were so dirty.  The walls were cracked and had water marks on the ceiling.  The bathroom was outrageously small, not fully painted and the molding was falling off the counter.  There are no fans in the bathrooms, the bathtub looked as though it was never cleaned.  They were either dirty or corroded.  There was hair all over the tub and shower wall.  We didn't get to sleep until 2 am and at 5:30 am, someone else close to our room, must have taken a shower because it caused our plumbing to howl!  Then again throughout the morning, it kept happening.  That was the push to request a new room.   

The next morning we requested a room change and were told to come back later that day.  The front desk met our request for a room change and moved us to a higher floor.  The bathroom was larger, but still no fan, and the paint coming off the walls.  The furniture in both rooms looked like they have been there since opening day.  Totally trashed and falling apart.  Upon Check-in we were charged $50 per night for incidentals, but there was no mini-bar or more damage we could have done.  When my wife asked at check-in, what the resort fee included, she asked about the pool and the front desk said that access was included in the resort fee.  Come to find out, we were told guests pay $10 to get into the pool (hopefully this person was just wrong).  Wi-fi is ""free,"" but my guess is that's where all of the resort fee applies.  

The buffet is alright, but nothing fabulous or brag worthy.  One set of elevators was up to date and in great working order.  The other set, 1970, and stop at EVERY floor, even when nobody is getting on.  At one point, there was a ringing bell which sounded like an alarm, and someone yelling.  Worried much? Carlos N'Charlies was a decent breakfast, but dinner was poorly serviced and there was no way it was considered ""busy.""  The Casino itself was good and fun to play in.

We gave 2 stars because it just wasn't the experience we were hoping for.  We have stayed at other locations, with a very comparable, if not better prices, and they were decades ahead of the Flamingo.  Our thoughts were, center of the strip, great price, and it's history so it should be good.  Next time we will spend the extra money to be in the center of the strip with a great experience.",2,0,0

 All issues were finally resolved but it was way more draining to stay here for a ""vacation"" than it should have been. If you choose to stay here, be sure to ask the front desk staff for a renovated room.

This place is affordable, its well known, and hey the pools are cool even in 2009.

And it has been recently updated in hot pink room accents, or dark brown and cream.

The flamingo exhibit is not to be missed. I have never seen nor heard of a black swan in my life! I wanted to feed him\/her so badly. She was elegant. Very cool. 

Pools and pools of cold water surround you after leaving the flamingo exhibit. And mind you, its 100 degrees in August so you will be totally refreshed by the spray hitting you even if you just walk by.

We came into to town for work and to visit friends and compete in a weekend long tournament plus a couple days and here is how it went down.


 check-in 1
1.  Check-in from the diamond lounge, service is stellar as usual
2.  Get to our room and it is a standard king sized room
3.  About 5pm we realize we're situated over carnival court can hear EVERYTHING
4.  Our neighbors check in and clearly plan to rage in their room. Awesome.
5.  I go to shower and find myself standing shin high in grey water (tub won't drain)
6.  I am greeted on my towel by a cockroach...this has never happened before  

Check-In 2 go to diamond office and change rooms

1.  All is well at check-in again
2.  We move rooms
3.  Our new room over looks the high roller (cool)
4.  Towards the evening hours we realize our neighbors have a dog
     - dog whines, barks, yelps for hours after being left alone
5.  We come back to the room after a long day of competition and dog is still upset 
6.  At 4am....our TV turns on blaring to the menu screen
     -the remote control doesn't turn it off and pushing power on the tv itself doesn't turn it off so we end up just unplugging it
7.  The lamps in the room are either broken or have some sort of short, once you turn the, on, they don't stay on

Day 3
1.  Elevator 1 doors will not close 
2.  Try to take a bath after another long day at competition and THIS TUB won't hold its water.  Ironic.  
3.  After everything else we just give up.  

By day 4, doggy couple checked out, reasonable neighbors checked in and we spent the remainder of our trip on the casino floor.  

Side note to housekeeping:  is it really necessary to slam the vacuum against the walls???  And two...why when we have a do not disturb card out do we get woken up at 9am to make sure we're checking out???

We paid extra for an upgraded room here - thought we would try it out as it is one of the only properties we have not stayed in.
The line up upon arrival to check in was INSANE. Yes, Vegas is about crowds, smoke and line ups but there has to be something this hotel can do to speed up the process. Maybe have staff come through the line with a clipboard and some room keys?
Here are some tips about the ""UPGRADE"" which is said to involve superior amenities.
We paid extra to check into our room right away after getting our keys and the maids were still cleaning it.  Nice, waiting outside our room after long flights with our luggage.
To stay in our non-smoking room is like sucking on a fresh cigarette every second. The smoke comes in through the vents 19 floors down, or through the smoking rooms. Health hazard, I feel like crap now! A maintenance guy came to spray disinfectant that did nothing. How do you combat incessant smoke billowing into your room without wearing a mask?
Do not expect a quiet room anywhere - the walls are paper thin. Our neighbors are lovely.... So. Not. Front desk are indifferent, will tell you to call security.
Satellite TV is so choppy that a half hour show went out about 20 times. The fact that we are not here to watch TV is besides the point. We are paying for the amenities and the problem as per the engineer that just left here is that our room's TV was not pixilated yet, so it is a known issue at least for our room. Not good.
One day we were half dressed just back in from the pool and 4 guys came into our room to look into the TV issue! ??? I asked them if they would have come in here without our being here and they answered yes. Kind of odd, that made us feel a bit uneasy. Our cleaning lady has been ok (keeps forgetting to leave us coffee!) but I met a couple in the elevator from another floor who stated that their maid rifled through their knapsack's bottom and stole $20 in change. Jeez!
We had to call the front desk to ask about the smoke, the TV and to ask for a do not disturb sign for our door.
The casino itself is OK, older but has character and the pizza in the food court, NY style is really good as is the baked ziti and chicken parm. Large portions. Staff at the shops at Flamingo are hit and miss with their personalities.
The TV built into the bathroom mirror is cool and the extra shower jets were neat. The shower did not run out of hot water once.
The location of Flamingo on the strip cannot be beat and that is why many stay here as well as a cheaper stay for those budgeting all their cash for gambling.
Next door to the north, MargaritaVille Casino has just opened up. Right next door to the south, Cromwells Hotel and Casino has opened up and that is a nice space to go and check out to see the type of atmosphere not offered by Flamingo.
For spoiling yourself and luxury, choose Vdara, Encore at Wyynn, Signature at MGM or Aria instead.",2,1,0

My colleague and I are part of a small business and had to pinch pennies anywhere we could, and thus we thought the Flamingo would fit that bill. The online price was very good and the pictures looked fine. I understand that the Flamingo is one of the older hotels on the main drag but still felt it would be acceptable for our situation.

Well my assessment was completelty off. All we really wanted was a hotel close to our conference hotel (Caesars) that had clean rooms and good pricing. The issues started right at check in. We were waiting on the notorious long check in line. The line was long but it was at least moving at a decent clip..... that is until a group of 20 chinese tourists bypassed the cattle call line and went right to the front desk. I am assuming they were part of a group, and perhaps they were allowed to go to that area to check in. Initially they had 2 front desk employees servicing them while three other front desk employees took us ""cattle"" in the other line. Its at this point all hell broke out. The group leader started to scream and curse at the front desk employees, flailing his arms and causing a huge commotion. His antics went on for 5 minutes or so until security showed up. The leader then disappeared and surfaced 15 minutes later. He then instructed his group to start going to all the front desk employees. The three front desk employees that were actually helping us in the general line would waive us on to the desk but then a member of the group would run up and cut in front of the person. At this time we were now on line for 40+ minutes, the line was not moving at all and people were getting very upset. Not once during this whole ordeal did the front desk explain what was going on, inform us that this was intentional or apologize. The poor security guard was now getting blasted by folks for ""allowing"" this group to run wild. He advised that the front desk is in charge of who gets serviced and when and that he had no power to prevent them from cutting the line. One of the ladies that was supposed to be ""next"" finally had enough and politely asked to speak with a manager. She was informed that there wasn't a manager available . It was 9:30AM in the  morning. I found it very rude that a manager couldn't come out and try and keep order in this chaotic scene. A little info would have gone a long way. 

Once we were actually able to check in it was even a bigger hastle. We had booked online and it asked if we had preferences, ie early check in, late check in, smoking, king etc. We selected early check in. No where did we see that it would  be 30 extra dollars for that. We were here for business and had meetings booked from 4pm on. We had just flown across the country , weathered an hour plus check in line and then were told it was going to be an extra charge. I understand if you don't have rooms available, but 30 dollars is absurd. What makes it even more frustrating is that they had rooms available but only if you paid their ransom.

Now the overall rooms were acceptable in terms of decent linens and working plumbing. The actual trek to the rooms was far from adequate. Half of the elevator bays were ""out of service"" when we arrived. At 10 am in the morning it was a 10 minute or so in order to grab an elevator that wasn't packed to the brim by fellow hotel guests. It was at night that the elevator issue became a nightmare. At 11 PM you had to wait around 35 minutes or so to grab one of the ""working elevators"". After you disembark the elevator you were greeted to a hallway that made the shining look comforting and cozy. The carpet was all loose and wavy like it has been through some water damage. It should be noted that the wavy carpet and broken elevator wing of the hotel was after we decided to cut our loses and ""upgrade"" one of our rooms to early check in. We wanted to at least be able to put our bags down and get ready for our meetings. We were told by the front desk employee that was could keep checking in to see if our other room was available before 4pm.  We checked every hour on the hour and finally at 3:30pm we asked if it was ready..... tadah nope it still wasnt ready but if we wanted to pay 30 dollars we could get early check in. At this point it was comical, 30 dollars for 30 minutes of advanced use. The sad part was that they told us to ""keep checking"" when I feel that they never had any intentions to allow us to check in prior to 4pm. If there were honest we would have ventured outside of the hotel, but since they were deceitful we wasted over 4 hours trying to get my collegues room. 



This just wasn't a great place to stay. I later found out a business client stayed at the Vdera (sort of in back of strip) for the same price, was able to check in early and had full fridge and a furnished kitchen.

Center strip location, to a great price compared to the quality and service you get. Its not tacky neither fancy, its a hotel, perfectly located to discover the rest of vegas. Pool area is BIG and will leave you two choices, either go the party\/music way or the calmer way in the pool upstairs. Pool area is definitely spacey and one of the better ones in Vegas. Also during season in weekends, they offer a light dayparty in the bigger ""Party"" pool. 

Overall, Vegas is a cheap place to find really fancy hotels, but you dont have to splurge to stay okay. I always go by the classic phrase ""Im just gonna sleep at the room"". And since i often stay for a week or so, I rather spend my money on other experiences outside the hotel. 

In Vegas I rank location before stylish hotels since location and distance is the vital thing here. So if you dont want to end up spending most of your time walking, stay centre strip!",6,0,0

Their room stinks of smoke, and they were told that they could change it  if the room still smelled after they sprayed it.  Not so, the girl on the desk  denied all knowledge saying no one ever changed rooms for that reason. 
I finally called (I'm the one babysitting and recommended the Flamingo) and spoke to a manager called Josh. He grudgingly offered that they could change their room to a lower floor as he said that they were sold out.

The room was lovely! King-sized bed that was super-comfortable, a thermostat that could be adjusted as low as I'd like (important in the land of 110 degree F temperatures), a large bathroom with separate shower and bathtub and a TV built into the mirror. My only gripe was that AT&T mobile reception was poor in my room (no major mobile carrier should have this problem on the Las Vegas Strip ... ). 

This is one of the oldest properties on the strip, and different room categories will almost certainly turn up different experiences. I'd come back.

Seemed pretty nice. Then we realized the air conditioner wasn't working well. It was Vegas, in August, and our room ran 75-80° at all times. We decided not to complain, we aren't in the room too much anyway. Just slept without blankets. Then the first person, my friend, tried to shower. The shower head shot off like a rocket nearly hitting her. When me and my husband came back from the pool she had just called maintenance. She was told 20-30 minutes. After 30 minutes, she called again. They said someone would be there soon. We had dinner and show reservations. After 90 minutes still no one. My husband attempted to fix it himself. When he turned the water after it seemed okay, he got hit in the chest by this shower head. So we all sucked it up, in our 80° degree room, and got ready, with no showers. After dinner and show we go to the front desk. We spoke with someone then spoke with the front desk manager Patricia 
She told us we had 2 choices. Go to our room and wait until maintenance shows up, and the hotel has no control over maintenance they show up when they want, or we could switch rooms. I really didn't want to pack all my stuff up but I also didn't want to sit around waiting hours for a maintenance person. So we moved. We packed up and had bell hop to our room in under 15 minutes. She didn't tell us she was moving us to a smoking room. It was disgusting. I have bad allergies and asthma. No way I could stay in there. So we called the front desk. They said they had no rooms left. Finally we are told they will move us to a suite with 1 king bed an a pullout couch. Not the 2 Queens we needed but I didn't need breathing issues either. So we agree to move, they said they would send up a bell hop with a room key and a cart for our luggage. 40 minutes goes by.... here comes the same bellhop who helped us earlier, with new room keys, but no luggage cart. Fine, we can drag all our stuff ourselves. To the 3rd room. We get in and while the Go room part looks great, the living room area looks like it hasn't been updated since 1976. The pull out couch, ridiculous. My dog sleeps on a nicer mattress than this. And where is the bedding....no where to be found. Yay, another call to the front desk. They will send some up. After 30 minutes of waiting, I tell my husband to stay in the room, me and my friend are going to the desk. Now the manager won't even come speak to us and is just relaying messages while calling the bell desk and house keeping to corroborate what I am telling her. Luke I am going to lie just for fun and to spend my whole evening dealing with her eye rolling. For the 2 hours and insane amount of inconvenience they gave us a whopping 2 nights resort fee refund. Yes, just the resort fee. A fee for stuff I don't even use on the first place. Finally bedding gets delivered, by maintenance, yes the same maintenance that can't be bothered to fix a shower head. They send housekeeping a little later to make the ""bed"" but my friend had already done it. She ended up sleeping on the lounge thing they had instead because the couch was insanely bad. Springs popping out and nasty stains. Just terrible. Lucky for us my husband brought his Leatherman tool on this trip. He had to fix several things in this room. The toilet seat was soo loose if you sat too fast you would fall off. The closet door handle was broke and the security latch was falling off of the door. And this is their ""suite"" I can't imagine that they actually charge people for this room. Next day comes around and we have the do not disturb sign out as we had a late night if spending 2 hours switching rooms. Room service calls at 12 and asks when they can come clean because our sign is out. My husband tells them they can come clean at 2. At 12:55 they call back, and ask again when they can come clean the room. At this point I swear the hotel is just messing with us. I have never had room service calling like this. When we leave, the do not disturb sign had been removed from our door. Suprise suprise. So for the whole resort fee refund we got back, I asked for a late checkout due to a late flight. 11am is too early for an 8pm flight. We get late checkout at 1. But they charged me $40 for it, so they got all their money in the end. Never, I repeate, never stay here. No matter how good the deal, no matter nice those Go rooms with the TV in the bathroom look. If you have any issues you will receive the absolute worst customer service anywhere. I have been treated better by a motel 6. It's hard to believe this is a Caesars resort. I have stayed at many other Caesars properties and received the best treatment until this. Now I recommend mlife resorts all the way. Again, avoid the flamingo at all costs.",4,2,0

Maybe some people will call me a hotel snob after reading my review. But when I spend money for a good night of sleep, I want to enjoy my sleep and not worry.
Perhaps I stayed at the 5 stars hotel more then the regular 3 stars one in Vegas, but even a nice motel is better then staying here.

2 1\/2 stars for the room itself. Minus 1\/2 stars for the disgusting, dirty parking structure and it's hallway to the casino. It's filthy and smelly. The Valet parking is totally on the other side of the building away from the casino and the hotel lobby! Kind of a long walk if you're carrying all those luggage.

I hate jumping from hotel to hotel, but since we wanted to extend our stay in Vegas and wanted a more convenient location on the strip, we searched the Internet and thought we got this great deal for a newly remodeled room.

THE ROOMS: 
It's like taking a 1980's hotel room and ""renovating"" it by cover ups. The rooms are repainted and floors were redone, and new beds. That's only the best part.
They have new vinyl wooden floor, no carpet except a small rug in the walk way. (Which is a good things so it doesn't stink from the 30 year old carpet.. lol)
The furniture as of the table, night light table, and TV stand are all kind of banged up and so ready for a face lift!

The room itself is OK., but the tiny bathroom is where I draw the line. The door hinges and side panels were all old and rusty. They're mildew stain on the corners and white tiles inside the bath tub. It's clean but it's old and it's falling apart. The bathroom floor tiles were black and dingy, guess when they replaced the room's floor, they couldn't budget another 60 square feet of flooring in for bathroom, instead they rather gross out their guests.  They have nearly to none amenities. No slippers, not even coffee maker. Even the Motel 8 down the street has a coffee maker. They have an old wall burnt out hair dryer. I wouldn't risk it, because it looks like it's ready electrocute you when you turn it on.

If they did a remodeled, why didn't they just rip everything apart and replace it back with a everything new, this way, it really looks like they took the easy way out. Cover the stain up but not cleaning it out!! Although it may not be that bad, but thought of it, is kind of disgusting. There is no fan blower in the small tiny bathroom. So if any one have to go #2, make sure you buy a room spray for the bathroom. Without the bathroom fan, even when I take a shower, I have to leave the door with an open airway, or else I would suffocate in the hot steam.

The air conditioning is hell LOUD! If you're a light sleeper, make sure it's off! 
We were in room 7084 and 7086 with a connecting door with old rusted door knob and chain. We had a great view of the strip right in front of the Caesar Palace fountain... It would have been so much prettier if the windows were clean. It was so disgusting and barely can see through the windows for the view.

Would I stay here again?.. probably not unless I was desperate.. The parking structure and valet is very inconvenience. It's only idealistic to stay here if you go out walking from casino to casino. But we don't. We just drive around and when we get back to the Flamingo, we just stay at the hotel\/ casino.",14,11,9

I can picture some dude named Vinny, who may or may not have some nebulous mob ties, sitting behind thick glass counting money, screaming for a cannoli, wearing a luxurious coat of chest hair and sporting a diamond encrusted pinky ring. Initially, i thought i was being a little racist, but then I met Vinny, our pit boss, and I didn't feel quite so racist anymore. 

The casino does exude that old school charm, though. Perhaps some of that charm is attributable to the fact that parts of the hotel just seem...old. Besides the casino, I would assume that most of the hotel has not been remodeled in a while, or if it has been remolded, someone did  a poor job. But, the good thing about the hotel is that it doesn't share most of the newer hotel's modern decorating flair. There is no worse fad for a fat guy then modern decorating. Yea, the super slim all leather chair\/ottoman hybrid is cool...unless you're bigger than a tiny child. Then the seat gets up when you get up, which is decidedly not cool. Also, the price reflects the older status of the hotel, so you can save a few duckets if you're trying to do Vegas on a budget.

Check-in can be a hassle depending on how you choose to do it. We used a debit card, so we had to pay in advance, and give credit\/debit cards for everyone in he room.   The rooms themselves are nothing spectacular. You'll find the bare essentials inside. The cable has a propensity to go out, so in the strange case you come to Vegas to only watch movies, you may be out of luck. While we were there, some guy doing construction across the way severed a power line and the whole hotel was out of power. The issue was not the hotel's fault and was resolved quickly, though. If you plan on going to Vegas and don't mind a slightly older hotel, perhaps you should give the Flamingo a try.",4,7,2

The bathroom was weird, the door was like a shadow box thing, it was kinda weird since there was nothing but dudes in the room.

The best part of the room was the Bose Stereo, you can connect your IPOD to this thing and it cranks! We had music blasting all night, never had security or neighbors knock on our door. 

The beds were comfy, I think I would pass out by the end of the night i think I would have been just as comfortable in the shower.

THe Flamingo was ok, I hate their Casino.. HET table game suck, way tooo many 6:5 payouts total BS. Right next door was Oseahs, we played beer pong there, good drink specials and th vibe was prtty awesome met a lot of cool chicks there.  Once again the table games sucked ass. Nothing but 6:5 Tables.

The only thing we ate at the Flamingo was Margaritaville, or however you spell it, drinks were pricey but it's vegas and the nacho chips were really good. If you go get the balcony view, you can drink each the nachos and talk shit about people as you watch them walk the strip. Good Times.

We saw George Wallace while we were there, he is there Star Comedian Act. he sucked cock and balls not worth 90 Bucks.. If you're going to see a show see Vinnie Favorito

The pool is great though, that's the best thing about the FlamingHO. Awesome pool scene.

A lot of hookers who bother you in the late hours, that's a minus or a plus depending what you're looking for.

Although the travel site we used to book our trip was a nightmare and had somehow missed a step between taking our reservation and sending it to the hotel, the woman who checked us in was wonderful.  She apologized (even though it was not the hotel's fault) and eventually found our convoluted reservation.  As an added bonus, she gave us a huge discount on the upgrade we wanted.

The wedding chapel was amazing; they eliminated the stress of planning a wedding and the package prices were very reasonable.  All I had to do was select the music I wanted and hand them my iPod.  The garden where we were married was beautiful; it was secluded and the gazebo was covered in ivy.  Come on!

As for the hotel itself, I really enjoyed my stay.  The Go Room was really nice with some impressive upgrades.  Who doesn't want to watch TV in the bathroom?  Especially when it's inside the mirror?

The casino was great, although we spent a lot of time playing beer pong at O'Shea's and snagging $0.99 margaritas at Bill's Gamblin' Hall & Saloon.

The Flamingo is in a great location (right on the strip) and within walking distance to other major casinos and hotels.

The hotel also has a stop on the metro which makes longer treks much easier.  I would highly recommend this hotel.",1,0,1

I think it is important to understand where I am coming from before progressing with this review. First I go to Vegas to have fun. My wife and I enjoy walking the strip and shopping during the day. We enjoy the huge selection of restaurants and clubs. We go to party. I am 41, didn't party much in my youth so we do so a bit now. I don't get wild at home but in Vegas my wife and I relax and let loose. The last time we were there I think we had 2 or 3 beers while standing in line to check in. So with that in mind please take my review as you may. 

From the description above we come to Vegas to have a good time. Not so spend time in our hotel rooms. We do appreciate a nice room with a view and great service is a must. I am just not willing to let some set backs distract from the real reason I am there. For those of you that are going to obsess about the room I would just say what are you doing? Get out of your room! The Flamingo does not have the best rooms. Non-smoking rooms are still smoky at times. This is Vegas, people drink and party and they smoke. While I do not smoke I accept that I have walked into this environment. I think the Flamingo does a great job accommodating their guests.

So rather than go on about the rooms or service I will tell you why I stay at the Flamingo and you can decide for yourselves. First the location is right in the middle of the strip and barring any construction projects it is easy walking distance to just about everything. Second it has history, it is the essentially the last original hotel on the strip. Sure things have changed greatly over the years but you can't help but feel a bit of the history at the Flamingo. Third the pool is amazing. Is it the nicest pool on the strip? Absolutely not but it is a rockin' party pool there is no doubt. It is one of the key reasons we stay there. It doesn't seem to brag about itself but it certainly delivers. Forth my wife and I got married at the Flamingo so there are sentimental reasons we stay there as well. 

At the end of the day it is not the greatest hotel. Having that said we accept that younger people will be loud, drink and stay up late. I accept that there may be loud music on our floor and that we may walk into a cloud of smoke. Vegas is what Vegas is, and it changes almost daily. If you want a great location, and a great pool the Flamingo is amazing with a touch of history to boot! If you want to stay in room and shake your fists at those young people then perhaps stay away...stay away from Vegas as well. This town is all about that so I think some things are a willing sacrifice for myself and my wife. I dont' want to down play service, but lets face facts, if the service staff in Vegas can handle drunk people 24\/7 I cut them some slack. 

So don't shake your fists as those young people, join them! The Flamingo has their shortcomings don't get me wrong, but please don't miss out on the big picture. I have never had a bad experience at the Flamingo and I have been there in the double digits of times. 

Stay at the Flamingo, enjoy!",5,2,2

No doubt it was tacky and could have used some touch up paint here and there but it was decent. The bed was comfortable and everything seemed pretty clean. Didn't care much for the timeshare salespeople hitting you up before you even get to the room. They act like they are gonna help you find your room but instead lead you into a less than straight forward sales pitch. Bad timing on that. The location is as convenient as you could hope for on the strip. The food was just OK, I'd eat over at Caesars Palace instead ( it's gonna be pricey either way).

Recently I checked into Flamingo hotel for the New Year celebration due to its location and availability. I guess when they remodeled the casino, they forgot to do the same thing to their rooms.

When I walked into the room, the stench was horrible (think stale cigar\/weed + old damp furniture + extremely dusty ventilation vent + yucky nasty rug) and everything was so old and outdated, that it looks like something you would see at low cost motel back in the 1980"". My friends and I literally said ""we paid $500 for this shit""? Since we checked in late on New Year eve and we were tired and thinking we wouldn't be spending that much time in the room anyway, we decided to let it be and go have fun.

Anyway, when we came back to the room at 3 am, the smell got so bad that we couldn't even sleep. We decided to check out and drove home to sleep. While we were driving, I was shaking my head and just couldn't believe that a major casino would let their rooms be that bad. SMH",5,0,0

Another thing I remember was that they had a candy store which when I was younger I would ask my mother for a few ounces of candy there. Many other memories reminded me that they are in a good place on the strip and they had good pricing. The ambiance on the other hand was casual not as much formal and it is a very interesting hotel.

We read all the reviews..Yelp!...Trip Adviser...you name it...so we decided on the GO Room and that I HIGHLY recommend as the other parties in our group did not, they went with the Fab Rooms (one the deluxe aka view of the strip, the others with the regular Fab Room) and were let down.  I'll start with their room reviews then go on to our room - 
Fab Rooms
- They told you on the phone the rooms had wood floors when in actuality had wood looking tile floors. In my opinion I like that better than carpet (which was in ours).  Seems a bit cleaner.  
- They had odd ""shag"" like covers on the bed - a half blanket - that looked like it had been made with the hotel.  
-  No fridge 
- The BATHROOMS were GROSS!  Super old and not renovated - they did throw in some marble looking slabs on the counters but not measured right or something as there was a gap between the wall and the sink - as well as one on the floor with the tile and there was tons of old trash stuck in there.  
- AC worked great 
- Beds weren't terribly uncomfortable. 
- View of Ceaser's Palace, not a lot of the strip, just a roof and Ceaser's Palace. (Deluxe Room - the other room just faced a roof and some of the trees over animal area. 

Now for the GO Rooms:
-  They are carpeted as I said above however our carpet wasn't stained or dirty.  Though I will admit there was an odd odor coming out of the corner of the closet.  -  The beds are SO nice and comfy! Pillowtop!! The pillows left a lot to be desired so I was glad we ended up in a room w\/ 2 Queen sized beds so I had more of a variety to choose from.  
-  There is a TV in the bathroom mirror (of course we never used) and a nice big one in the room.  There is a fridge and a coffee maker with decent coffee!   
- Bathroom itself was new and clean with a huge shower, cute sink, lots of space and a mid body shower head!  
- AC worked great! 
- The view was decent as well - we were on the 16th floor and overlooked a zebra painted rooftop, the wedding ceremony area, and some of the pool and trees.  
Oh and I do have to say when people say the walls are thin they are NOT kidding!  The walls are terribly thin, you can easily hear your neighbors and the doors are so heavy they slam shut every time!  We were all on different floors (10th, 14th and 16th) and all had the same problem.

The staff was helpful and nice at the hotel.  Only played some slots in the casino - there was a Hangover game and some genie game we did well at.  And next door is a cute little casino -  the Margaritaville Casino.  While I will not recommend Margaritaville itself (refer to my review on that page) I would recommend the It's 5 O'Clock Somewhere bar!  The bartenders are awesome and 'tend with ""flair!"" They definitely have tricks up their sleeves.  Our bartender, Sooshey (I hope I spelled that right), was awesome and could poor a quite tasty, quite colorful waterfall of kamikazes!  

The pool is also very nice and large, not a lot of chairs so get there by 8am if you want one.  Also, security does search through all of your bags so you might as well bring as little as possible and you must be 21 to enter into the GO Pool area.  Drinks are pricey but we found that they did a $5 special on Blood Marys until 11am.  

What else, what else - oh yeah internet is $13.99 \/day \/ laptop and my T-Mobile 3G hardly ever worked in the room.  Easy checkout if you already paid for your stay (we used BookIt.com), via TV in your room or drop your key in the pink box in the lobby.  Easy to catch a shuttle to and from the airport.  They will check your baggage though they employees WILL expect a tip and they will be VERY verbal about it.  We are good about tipping but the things some of the employees said to others made me not even want to tip them!  

Again I think a solid 4 stars.  If the price is right we'd stay here again.",8,1,3

The past week I had the pleasure of staying at two Hotel and Resort Casinos on the strip. One was fantastic, the other... Not so much. Unfortunately the Flamingo was the ""not so much"". 

I first stayed at the Monte Carlo and can't say enough good things about and it was a fabulous stay. I reviewed it earlier in the week. Normally I wouldn't have stayed at the Flamingo as I like the more moderate to upscale resorts. I figure if I'm going to stay on the strip for 7 days I'm going to spoil myself. What brought me to the Flamingo was my father and stepmother. They paid for my wife and I's last few days and it happened to be at the Flamingo. 

My first impression was ""Seedy""! I was not impressed what so ever. And it was how I always imagined it would be, not good at all. So we checked in and my stepmom payed for both our rooms and it came out to over $2500! WHAT! Now, my parents did get a huge suite but damn! Being a Vegas veteran I knew she could have gotten a better room at a better resort but she had paid already so it was to late. My wife and I get to our rooms and the room looked like it had modern twist on the 70's, not impressed. To top it off there was a HUGE mold growth in the corner of the shower! How it was over looked for so long should tell you how important the employees feel about their place of employment. Luckily, once we complained and showed the front desk people the picture, they reluctantly changed our rooms and my stepmom was comped $260. 

The Elevators in the Flamingo are very old, dangerous, death traps. They are accidents waiting to happen and every time I stepped into one I feel I had to kiss my wife good by just in case I didn't make the trip to the lobby. Plus, they all have their own personalities, on one the door would slam, I mean SLAM shut, others would creek, one stopped on every floor, one sounded like it was on its last leg. Basically those elevators aren't safe. And don't get me started on their horrendous parking structure, one word: Ridiculous!

Also, the people that stay at the Flamingo are an interesting bunch. I'll say this, people at the Aria, Cosmo, Caesars Place, Venetian and the likes are much more pleasant to be around. 

The Flamingo gets one star because the employees there are serviceable and took care of our needs. I can't in good faith recommend this hotel when there are much more, better hotels around. Stay elsewhere my friends.",23,5,4

We got a top level room and it had two twin beds, a shower and bathroom, a closet, a TV and was very comfortable.

The view was awesome from that high up, we were hardly in the room that much, but the beds were just fine.

The casino looked full most of the time and they had a few good shows going on. If you look, you can probably find a 2-1 for those.

The only thing that stunk was waiting about 30 minutes to check in, because they only had three people to check guests in. Big boo! The line just kept growing and growing behind us.

Overall, a fun place, the pool is only open until 5, but that is pretty common in Vegas. I don't think they want a lot of liquored up people swimming in their shallow pool. Also, you can't bring your own beer down to the pool. This is because they charge a lot for it down there for their stuff.

I was quite disappointed to find out when i checked in 20 mins ago that all king bed rooms were gone and was given a choice of 2 Queens or a king studio. I thought well thats a no brainer, king studio? Wrong, at least the counter clerk was kind wnough to warn me that these were the ""NON renovated rooms"".. i asked if there was anything else available and only offered smoking rooms. 

I know its not the end of the world, but being as we have a king at home, and had purposely upgraded to the ""nicer"" king room, i figured hey it happens, but the least they could do is give me a real upgrade? 

Well the real disappointment happened when checking into our two queen bed yet ""renovated"" room.. Well renovated means new beds (nice enough) and flooring and wall stuff. But a tiny tv from 6 years ago and an ancient bathroom and tub..long story short, when giving me the room, they waived the $25 resort charge, which now i would have gladly paid just to have the room i booked. So with all that said, glad we are moving to a different hotel tomorrow night!

Icing on the cake! Woke up this am to go get some water and stuff from the vending machine. Our floor won't take dollar bills. OK.. go down a floor! Success! $3 for a bottle of water! A hot bottle of water! Have a good day flamingo!

""Vegas, sweet! Where are you staying?"" [Meaning: Cosmopolitan, MGM, or Wynn?] 
""The.... uh.... Flamingo."" [Please don't judge me.]
""Oh. Have fun."" [I judge you! Go to the Flamingo, you cheap, trashy man.]

Defense: It's a decent hotel in the center of the Strip that allows me more walking cash for dining and playing. The hotel is not nearly as dreadful as portrayed *for the cost*, so I'd still recommend it over Bally's and other value options I've tried, for the location, the pool, and the totally fine rooms, many with awesome views. If not for one issue:

RESORT FEES: All three stays were pre-Resort Fee. Caesars made a huge mistake in adding these because despite Flamingo's drawbacks, I could at least claim to spend $60-80 less in pointless fees per visit than at other Strip hotels. No more. They removed a huge loyalty driver, and now our next stay is at Encore; if I'm forced to pay resort fees, I'm going to do it at a real freaking resort. 

FAB ROOM: The cheapest, clean and modern. Oh also, one morning we woke up and there was no water - we couldn't shower or leave for hours. It really sucked, so I wrote a letter and they offered me a mini-suite, which I thought was a fair effort to make good. 
GO MINI-SUITE: Great, beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains; we were comp'd up to it but teeters on 'value' at normal pricing ($100+\/night); 
GO ROOM: Solid, south strip view, probably the best option for price.

POOL: Beautiful, tropical paradise, definitely a party scene. Security was standard gruff. Flamingo habitat is a Kodak stop. (Insta-what, sonny?)

BUFFET: Comp'd, though I now believe this was a punishment. The buffet was terrible. 

CASINO: Never did that well but we usually played a bit on the way in and out. 

PARKING: People claim these horrendous parking ordeals - we never circled more than 10 minutes, and we were in and out a lot.

CHECK-IN: Bypass the painful check-in line with a Total Rewards Gold card. Not platinum, not diamond, just plain' ol gold. If you don't have one, sign up on the spot, have a margarita, play a couple hands, and you'll still get through the Gold check-in faster than waiting in regular.",8,2,1

FOR THE PRICE, THIS IS WHY THIS PLACE IS AWESOME (people like to compare it to some 5 star resort, which it is not trying to be):

*Rooms are clean an spacious.  Recently renovated with wood-look vinyl plank flooring.  Bathrooms were not updated, but are liveable for the short amount of time a normal personal would spend in there.  A\/C worked great.  Flat screen TV.  

*No resort fees

* Perfect location on the strip, walking distance from all of the big casinos

*The pools are so fun, great party atmosphere.  Probably not so much fun if you are just looking to relax.   Drinks are expensive, but that's expected at a pool on the strip in LV.

Bummers:  No in-room coffee maker, my room was so far away from the elevator-I had to walk a mile to get to it, check in line is very long (unless you are a TR member or use the kiosks), internet is $13\/day and they block signals from private air cards and such.

Can I have my time and sleep back instead?

3. Got stuck in the elevator by the parking garage on my last night. This was a nightmare considering I am claustrophobic!!! Security had no idea where we were. We were stuck 2 ft. below the actual floor so I was able to pry the door open myself and let everyone out.

Las Vegas.

That being said, this was an okay hotel.  I got the best room available to the public, and it was $130.  And it was decent.  So, that's not bad.  And the room service buffalo wings were decent, and only $10.  And that's not bad.  But they wanted to charge me for Internet access.  Which is bad.  And there was almost no way to plug in my laptop and sit on the bed and put together PowerPoint slides, because the outlet was so far away.  And that's not good.  And I showed up to check in at 10:00 at night, and it took them 20 minutes to get me checked in.  And that's bad.

But, I try not to inflict my bad habits on others (with fair-to-middling success).  'Nuff said.

All in all, Flamingo did an average job of housing me for the 22 hours I spent in Vegas.  For the benefit of the Las Vegas Tourism Council, I will note:

1. I did not gamble with a single penny of money during that time;
2. I never left my hotel during that time;
3. The only alcohol I consumed was free, as part of the seminar I was speaking at.

Room 1-overwhelming odor so stale smoke, super dirty windows and way far from elevator.
Room 2-(previosly inhabited), stuff in the trash, towel on the floor, bed covers not done, pubes on the bathroom floor and to top it off, what appeared to be old bloody foot prints on the boxsprint cover of both beds!
Room 3-View of a wall and industrial vents and the overwhelming sound of the operating vents
Room 4(the one we stayed with)-toilet was not working properly and music from somewhere in the hotel could be heard all day and night.

Pool-pool is nice but get there when it opens otherwise you will not find a chair.

Cleaning service:  The cleaning lady went through my girlfriends bag which she had purposely zipped closed because we were expecting the cleaning service to come since we weren't provided a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign to begin with, and we cam home to an unzipped bag upon return.

Other observations:  Rinky-dink hotel, Elevators falling apart, furniture is old, out-dated and all busted up, Bathroom fixtures are coroded and rusty.  Staff is 50-50 (some were rude while others were very nice).

Our room was dirty beyond belief: lime scale all over the showerhead (the showerhead ring was hanging off of the wall), a dirty torn shower curtain, a filthy black hole full of dust and grime where the bathroom vent used to be, dust all over the lamps and in the corners of the room, AND our room wasn't cleaned ONCE during our stay despite requesting it from the front desk AND the cleaning staff.  Strange, because there were people cleaning rooms on our floor.  Just not ours, apparently.  

Additionally, the closet door was broken and one of the outlets had been pushed through the drywall.  Some of the lamps and the clock had been unplugged so we had to do a little work to figure out which outlet was connected to the wall switch so that the clock would work properly.  The TV and a bunch of other things were plugged into a power strip that was shoved into a corner but still fully visible. Classy.

NONE of the speed-dial buttons on our phone worked except for room service (Eventually we were told, ""Yeah, they don't work. Just dial 0."")  which is funny because we didn't have a room service menu and had to ask the hotel (on the phone and in person) for one THREE TIMES (over the course of a full day) before they sent one up.

The hallways outside our room were grimy: filthy stained carpets full of old gum, with bubbles and rolls where they'd gotten stretched out from so much use.

The elevator doors don't always open (or close) properly. Scary.  Plus, when you push the button for your floor, the light doesn't light.  Oh wait, yes it does but only on the OTHER side of the car.  What?

The once beautiful flamingo pool and grounds of yore have been mostly removed and replaced with additional buildings and parking.  Instead there is a horrid ""day club"" pool full of wasted 20-somethings listening to earsplitting crappy music.  The kiddie pool is a little better but its not really separated from the ""Go"" pool so after 10 am it sucks too.

Lest you think I'm just being bitchy, we requested a room change on day two and were told that it could take up to six hours between checking out of one room and receiving another.  Um.  No.  We were very up-front with the management and received a small amount of compensation but the number of people I had to talk to get anything done was just insane and at the end of it, the compensation I was promised was not what was delivered.

Noise is your biggest enemy in the hotel.  The walls are paper thin, there are tons of connecting rooms, and now that they removed the carpeting and put in vinyl floors.....noise carries.  Even basic conversations next door.  Of course you also have the rude loud tourists cruising the halls at 2 am or the neighbor slamming their doors at 5 am!

We proceeded back downstairs to stay our neighbors were incredibly loud and got reassigned.  Next room was 21st floor, looked the same but had a settee!  Sadly, the Fab rooms do NOT have a coffee maker so we had to trek to the lobby every morning to buy a $3 cup of coffee.  However, our room was clean and the bed was very comfy.  It was certainly acceptable.  Our wifi worked ok if not great.

Everyone complains about the elevators....fortunately we only had one real hassle but that was check out time and every elevator was full of people with luggage.  We didn't find them to be that terrible.  It was easy to catch the $7 shuttle back to the airport -- you can charge the voucher to your room!

We didn't eat at the Flamingo but there is a small food court and several restaurants.  Lots of restaurants also outside by the Linq and a great new food court inside Harrahs.  

Casino cocktail service -- they did a good job of coming around regularly.  Both at the Mirage and Linq we gave up trying -- half an hour and still no beverage service!  The casino looks very dated and definitely needs some updating but there are tons of other casinos to choose from!

Location can't be beat so we would definitely consider returning.  Seems Harrahs, Flamingo, and Linq all have mixed reviews so pick the best deal and have fun!",1,0,0

The GO rooms are kinda like staying on board Virgin Airlines. Sleek mod white plastic, hot pink accents, auto-curtains, an empty mini-fridge to keep your stuff in, an iPod plug-in for the cd player\/radio, a HUGE flat-screen wall-mounted TV, a chaise lounge by the window and what's this? A small TV monitor built into the bathroom mirror??? With it's own remote?? That's just nuts. 

The bed was super-plush, our view was spectacular and the maids not only obeyed our ""do not disturb"" sign, they came back as soon as we left the room every day and did an amazing cleaning\/straightening job. They definitely earned their tips! 

In addition, my friends got married in the Garden Chapel, and the staff could not have been more helpful and awesome through the entire process. And the pool was VERY nice. Tons of chairs lining the entire length of the water, so I had no problems finding a spot to bake in while I sipped my (two) mimosa(s) - hey, one was free! What can I say? 

Sure, the casino floor was a little dated, the buffet was just ""eh"" and I'm knocking a star off for us arriving at 9:30 am and them not having a room ready until FOUR pm, but overall I loved it. Specifically, I love that they've updated some of the rooms, but kept the overall feeling and outside decor to reflect a classic Rat Pack-era feeling. It wins for being one of the only original casinos left, and not disintegrating into dive-y grossness.

I wasn't trying to wait in line again so just paid it. Room was ok as long as you don't look to close.  It was not what I was expecting.  We booked a fab luxury strip view mainly for the whirlpool tub but when we got to the room it had a regular tub and the view was nothing to write home about.  The room seemed half renovated.

It was our first time in Vegas and it was a positive experience in the city and hotel. We got the very basic 2 queen room with no view. We had a view to the high roller but since it was on the 4th floor we could also see the top of the casino roof. The room was clean, as much as it could be cleaned, because the scrapes and scruffs are because it's kind of old, so if that bothers you then I'd suggest a more expensive room. I personally don't care about that as long as it's clean, we only needed it to sleep anyways not live in it. 

-The cleaning ladies were nice. Our room was cleaned every day by the time we got back in the evening. 

-The valet guys were ok. Friendly. 

-The bell hop was a super nice guy. He would reminds us to make sure we didn't forget anything in our rooms, and took our luggage outside near a bench so we can wait for our ride. We tipped him $10 and he was so grateful about it, it made me sad to think most people probably don't tip him. 

-When you sign up for the rewards card and go pick it up at the desk in the lobby, they give you some coupons for free shows. That was nice. (Also in the room make sure to look at the little coupon booklet, has a lot of good deals! And also the coupon book at the tram station!)

So we get in, and as a hot tip, the check in kiosks suck. There was a reason we had to stand in line for like ten minutes behind smelly skanky girls to get into our room.

But when we got in, damn. It was awesome.

So the girl at the front was the sweetest lady ever. I don't remember her name, but she's from Torrance and she's awesome. She hooked it up with a free upgrade and let me tell you, it was freaking awesome.

So our room was on the 22nd floor and was gigantic (like, my apartment is tiny so this was amazing gigantic). There were floor to celing windows that overlooked ceasars, the bellagio, and had a perfect view of the bellagios fountain show. It was way too awesome. We had a few couches, a gigantic flat screen, and there was a tv screen inside the bathroom mirror (which is how I found out Friends is on Nick at Nite- jeez I feel old). 

To top it all off, the curtains were controlled by a switch next to the bed. As in, when you flip a switch the curtains open and shut. Freaking baller.

When I go into a casino, I am usually playing blackjack, or my wife may wander off to a poker room.  Sometimes, I just want to play a little video poker at the bar and sip on a drink while I watch my quarters slowly vanish.

I have gone into the Flamingo casino many times, and my wife likes the atmosphere.  Not too smokey, most people are having fun, and it is easy to people watch out on the strip.  However, the last experience took it down a notch or two.

We were playing blackjack at a table.  The dealer was really friendly and helpful, which to me is the main reason for being at a blackjack table.  I am not there to win serious money...I am there to have fun.  If the dealer isn't much fun, then why bother?  Anyway, one of the things that I expect is to be able to get a drink (whether alcohol or not) about every 30 to 40 minutes.  Well, the drink lady came around when we seated ourselves.  She took our order, and she was back in a reasonable time (about 10 minutes).  Then, about 40 minutes later, she came by to pick the glasses up in a rush while my wife was meeting a man about a horse.  Didn't even bother to take another drink order.  Another 40 minutes later, and she was not to be seen.

We let the dealer know that we really enjoyed her company, but we can't stay if we are only going to get drinks every couple of hours.  She agreed, and we chipped up and left.

The other thing that can be bothersome is that they have a few tables on the outside that only pay 6 to 5 for blackjack.  Sorry, that is where the money is made, and it just seems very cheap to do that.

Pros:
Clean
Great on-the-strip location
Newly updated rooms
Food Court available
Monorail Station
We dont gamble, but the casino looked pretty busy the whole time we were there!

Cons:
1. They put a large hold on our acct until about a week after we got home. We asked why and called multiple times during our 8-day stay and they would take the hold off, then put it back on again the next day. But we were charged correctly in the end.
2. We own a very ... expensive truck (which was why we were there. our truck was featured in the SEMA show). The valet did not take this into consideration when slamming on gas & brake, running over curbs and treating it like their little sports car (which i suppose explains why they don't know how to drive a lifted truck.). I made sure to talk to the supervisor, but he kind of chuckled at me, as if he was supposed to do anything about it and went on his way. NOT cool.

They posted on the website that they had plenty of parking lot but when we arrived the parking was small and shared with 2-3 other companies. It was not easy to find a spot at all. My room was clean and everything seem ok but their AC system was too loud to have a nice sleep. Dont book the smoking room because the whole walking hall smelled like a weed project. Would not recommend buying anything from their store because they charge $10 for a small colgate toothpaste. Unbelievable! I give them 2 stars bcs we booked the room only for $160 (2 nights) and the convenience location nearby other beautiful hotels strip.,0,1,0

I'm sure this is a normal occurrence for them, and very irritating for them but they seemed to be very understandable. He helped me find the elevator and asked if I was ok. (Probably normal procedure but still caught me off guard...) I got to my room to notice that I lost my glasses and my iPhone. It's lost, gone I thought. I called my phone and security said they found it and to come down to ""lost and found"" when I ""sobered up and got some rest."" I didn't expect them to hand over my phone right away. Yes, I did have to sign something and do some verification but it's all appreciated. I mean, I don't want them to hand over my phone to just any asshole that claims to lost a phone.

But on this trip - my viewpoint changed. Where you stay determines the overall crowd, and a young, hip one is what we wanted. The Flamingo sure ain't that. Granted, it didn't stop us from meeting tons of like-minded people ... just not in our hotel.

The price was OK (about $125 a night for this particular weekend), but looking back, it would have been totally worth it to spend just a little more and stay at Planet Hollywood or the Cosmopolitan. Lesson learned.

The Flamingo has two main selling points - their badass, central location on the Strip, and a Margaritaville on site. Otherwise - the rooms are just ok, the front desk doesn't provide even the smallest of comforts (I called for a toothbrush when my  bag was delayed, they told me to go buy one), internet was overpriced, no minibars in the rooms and the crow was pretty lowbrow.

Their X Burlesque show was totally entertaining (separate review to come), but otherwise - I definitely wouldn't stay here again, especially when so many other, better options abound with a negligible price difference.",7,2,2

I'm a local, but figured we might as well stay down on the Strip to enjoy the night! Upgraded to the newly renovated rooms and was excited! 

When we arrived in our room, there was trash in the trashcans, wet towels on the floor of the bathroom, beds were halfway made (end of bed runners just crumpled on the floor), and there were things strewn about that looked like they were left from a previous guest. We called down to the front desk who transferred me to a rude housekeeper who said someone would be up to finish cleaning the room. We were on our way out to dinner and the show anyway, so we said that was fine.

Flash forward to midnight when we returned to the room. Nothing had been touched. In 8 hours. Once again, I called downstairs only to be transferred around to 4 different people and ultimately disconnected. I called once more and asked (still being very nice) to speak with a manager. After being transferred again to someone in housekeeping and letting her know that I wanted to speak to a front desk manager, one was connected to me. He said someone would be up right away to fully clean our room. By this point, it was 12:30am and we did not want housecleaners spending an hour in the room. I asked for just towels, blankets, and some form of compensation. The manager told me all he could offer was a late check out. Really? I slept in a dirty room and am checking out tomorrow morning to go home (7 miles away)...I don't want to stay longer than necessary. I asked if he could comp the resort fee...big NO to that. My fiancé is a manager at one of the MGM properties, so I know that the resort fees is one of the absolute easiest things to knock off for guest disputes. But no. He offered $25 food and beverage credit. I told him that between that point and 8am (when we were leaving), we wouldn't be eating. He confirmed that the credit could only be used while we were still checked in on this stay. His resolution was to give me $50 food and beverage credit instead and say nothing else could be done. Click. 

20 minutes later, a housekeeper gave us 3 towels, no blankets, and a ton of shampoo (???). Then we proceeded to order $30 of room service that did not get eaten just because we felt we needed to attempt to use the F&B credit. The whole plates were still in the room when we left in the morning. 

Overall, horrible customer service experience. The ""renovated"" rooms may look nice at first glance, but it is obvious they were done in a hurry. The paint is peeling, furniture was not replaced, bathrooms are still horrible, etc. Also, the hallways are dim and there was plastic wrap and caution tape all over the place. 

I completely agree that you get what you pay for... but for $140 (still very reasonable for a Friday night on the Strip), I'd expect a sliiiightly better time than this. DON'T STAY HERE. Or any Caesar's property really. I've also had bad experiences at others. Stay at an MGM or Steve Wynn owned establishment...or my fave, the Cosmopolitan.",1,0,0

Part of my choosing this hotel is b\/c of my favorite band The Killers and their album ""Flamingo"". I think that had something to do with it. haha.

I even had to apologize to everybody for booking the room. But after actually staying at the Flamingo and having a great experience I am now wondering if some of these bad reviews are even legit.

The customer service wasn't as bad as they said it was, in fact...the guy we dealt with was very nice and overly-friendly. The rooms were clean and nice.

Pro-
Buffet- crepe station had a very sweet lady who made pretty good crepes. 

Cons-
1) The resort fee was applied and yet we were not ale to use any of the 'resort perks'.  For one, we had to pay an additional pool fee.   I was told we had to pay an additional fee because there was some DJ that day.   Shouldn't the hotel be responsible for paying for 'extra' things like DJs once the consumer has paid a resort fee?  Otherwise, that does that resort fee I pay go towards?  

2) The resort fee also includes WiFi.  However, at no point did the Flamingo 'turn on the wifi' for my room.  I spent the better part of an hour having the tech department trying to figure out why I was not able to connect to the internet, over the phone.  In the end the woman I was talking to had to manually connect my one phone by sending the WiFi to it.  I went to bed and woke up in the morning to check into my flight and, surprise, surprise, the WIFi was not working.  Again. 

Paying for services that are not provided is the worst type of stealing a large company can do to a consumer. 

3) The rooms are not clean.  When we arrived my husband took his shoes off to hop into the shower and as he stepped away from his shoe he stopped into a piece of glass.  Seriously, glass.

When I jumped into the shower I saw hair in the tub.  I had to shower because we had plans but this is disgusting.  I rinsed the shower and hopped in with my sandals.

As I was about to pull the curtain to close it, three small, WET, towels fell from the towel rod.  We had just checked in and hadn't used the bathroom- those were NOT our towels. 

After what felt like I had bugs crawling over my skin (because the shower was so gross), I got out and tried to brush my teeth.  As I reached over to get a glass of water to brunch my teeth with, I noticed that the glasses on the sink were all dirty.  They had what appeared to be water stains on them.  Both glasses seemed used.   

And folks, there's more.  The next morning, we requested the room to be cleaned and when we arrived, my husband took his shoes off on the bed to walk over to the closet to change into an other pair.  Guess what he stepped on, again?  An even larger piece of glass.  So, for the second time in less than 24 hours, we had to check the floor for glass.  

Lastly, aesthetically speaking, the rooms are not modern (pretty sure they haven't updated the rooms since the early 90s).  The wall paper all over bathroom was peeling, there were water and mold marks on the ceiling.  The clothes line in the shower was broken and came off the wall. 

Honestly, dirtiest hotel I have ever stayed at. 

4) The buffet- though Vegas is not known to be a 'foodie' town this buffet was not good.  The food was bland and the selection was not the greatest on the strip. They had crab legs so there's that but in my book crab legs don't make up for all the other gross food.  

5) Hilton properties should be embarrassed to have this be a representation of their brand on the LV strip.  

I stayed here during the chaos that was the 'big fight' in August 2017 and can guess that all hotels might have had hiccups similar to this.  However, this should have been an opportunity for the Flamingo to truly showcase themselves as an option for travelers coming to Las Vegas.  Unfortunately, not only was there no attempt at positioning themselves as a 'destination on the strip' they couldn't even get simple, run of the mill hotel operations right.  

Won't be staying here again and I don't recommend you stay here either.",1,0,0

1. The car park is around the back of the hotel, with no front entrance that I saw.  Given the huge increase in LV traffic, good luck in finding the parking garage if you get stuck on the strip.  Do what  I did: turn right onto Flamingo Blvd. and then cut across 5 lanes of traffic into The Cromwell's parking garage and, from there, cut a sharp left into a back alley, and drive until you find (accidentally, completely by chance) the back entrance to the Flamingo's parking garage.  Extra points if you do NOT get a ticket, hit a taxi or drive the wrong way down a one way street. Of course, now that I've been to the Flamingo, I know the score.   Grade: D.

2.  Arrive at check in, after a long car drive, and be greeted by the biggest A$$hole the Flamingo's HR department could find.  Benjamin the desk clerk, a short, chubby, balding, snippy jerk with darting reptilian eyes, will make you feel super welcome and not at all turned off by his bitchy behavior.  If you're lucky, he might even condescendingly insult members of your party too! Right to their faces!!  Although I would have to say that Benjamin's the lucky one here ..... the men in the party wanted to kick him in the nuts.... but I wouldn't let them.  I will, however, say that the next two desk clerks I dealt with were both very nice ladies.  Benjamin, however, succeeded grandly in angering 2 members of our party which basically put a damper on the entire 3 days we stayed .... initially, people wanted to immediately go find another room in another hotel but that wasn't possible.  Thanks solely to Benjamin, I give the check in process a ...... Grade: F.  Thanks to you, ""Ben"", we probably will never return.

3.  ROOM PROS: The bathtub drained well.  Plenty of towels and supplies.  Strong water pressure, painful like a fire hose.  Comfortable beds made up with decent sheets, etc.  Hardly heard any noise from adjoining rooms which was nice ..... no flushing toilets, running water, stomping, yelling, etc.  Great mirror coverage in the bathroom ..... big mirror above the sink, fabulous full length wide mirror on the far end bathroom wall.  Very comfortable air conditioning ..... breezy.

ROOM CONS:  Our rooms were dirty.  I can say with certainty, the floor probably wasn't vacuumed properly or mopped for at least 2 weeks.  Lots of dust and hair on the floors, behind the TV cabinet, desk and armchair ..... floor was quite grotty in fact.  Rug, although grey and black, was obviously stained and grubby.  Bathrooms in dire need of an upgrade ....... above our bath was a metal rusty stained trap door of sorts .....hardly up market.  Lousy free TV selection.  Lampshades with big holes in them.

4.  Very expensive snack shops ..... you will pay $4 for a can of Coors and $3.50 for a bottle of water.  Elsewhere in the hotel, I paid $6 for a can of Coors.

5.  Crappy pool ..... it's a trek to get there too, at least from where Benjamin put us, way the heck back in the hotel with nothing but a brick wall for a view.  Grade: D

6.  Elevators that kept breaking down.  On the occasions that we actually stepped into an elevator without a maintenance man in it, the sounds coming from the elevator shaft were enough to bring on panic attacks and sudden frights.  The last thing I want to hear while riding an elevator is loud CLANGS, THUDS and other strange noises. Everyone riding with us was freaking out.  Grade: F

CONCLUSION: I wanted a hotel right in the middle of the strip for a decent rate.  I got the location, and I paid around $70\/night per room.  I wasn't expecting decadent luxury but I DO expect a clean room and a nice bathroom.  The Flamingo gives off an old and tired vibe ...... dentures and stale cigarette smoke sort of vibe.  I guess I can live with that but I CAN'T live with rude A$$hole customer 'service'.  Benjamin really did ruin our first night in Vegas with his nasty manner because it was so unexpected.  Dude, if you hate your job that much, LEAVE.  No one will miss you.  And, solely because of you, my next trip to Vegas will be spent at either The Cromwell, Harrah's, Paris or Planet Hollywood.

There was construction being done around the Flamingo, but I called the hotel and they were nice enough to give directions while we were driving. Valet said they were full, the lot said they were full, but we found free parking for not but across the street. Fine. When we walked with all our luggage to to hotel, suddenly valet was open. Clearly some kind of poor communication. I had a bit of a freak out at that point being so tired and hauling everything to the hotel that they went to go get my car for me and park it in valet to make up for the problem. A bell hop helped us the rest of the way and even told us some of the best secret places to see. 

We ate at their dining establishments and got snacks for my conference at their gift shop (overpriced, but whatever, it was better than convention kiosk rates. The outdoor bartender at one of the locations knew a bunch of tricks which resulted in us hanging out there way too long and buying too many drinks. :) Breakfast was huge and delicious. I told the waitress that I was in a bit of a hurry, apologetically, and she made sure to get us our food pretty quickly. Extra tips for her.

We got the GO room. We liked it. It was affordable and beds were comfy and the rooms were fun. I don't recall the casino or at least the hotel portion smelling too badly of cigarette smoke. Something I just cant stand about Reno or Vegas, which is why we don't spend much time in these locations. I love that the tram is behind the Flamingo. It made traveling to the end of the strip and to the Convention Center so easy. They have a little Flamingo\/wildlife area thats kinda quaint to check out on property.

We spent hrs of our day with security looking for it only to be compensated $50 food credit which wasn't even good at most locations in the hotel. We tried to get late checkout on Sunday  because me lost so much of our previous day searching for the bag and were denied. Manager quoted us a price much higher than published rates and even more than weekend rates. The pool was closed to a private party on Saturday which we were not warned about upon booking. Neither of our rooms were strip view like we requested and paid for. We will never stay here again. Go pool was fun when it was actually open.,0,1,0

For an extra 20$ a day we could upgrade to the new go- rooms. Finally they tell us there is a room they know is clean on the 15th floor they will send someone to take our bags there. When the bell man came he walked us to the new room while we carried our own bags. We spent two hours of walking, waiting, and pleading with the front desk to please give us a clean room!!!

We stayed on a renovated floor, room was nice and clean. Elevators were a joke. We had to use the SPA elevators. There were only 3 in service, one of which stopped at every floor on the way down for no reason. There were always lines to get on to go up and they took for ever and were packed going down.

I had to pay the famous ""resort fee"". For internet and phone I didn't use and a pool that was always closed. If you want to sleep well on Friday or Saturday, forget about it. 20-somethings running through the halls, crashing into doors, playing loud music and making noise til 6 am is the norm. I called the front desk and complained and they did nothing.

Me and the fellas (a group of 8) go to Vegas every Feb and will most likely NOT be staying here again.

Also, try to get a room higher up and on the side facing Paris\/Cromwell. Otherwise you will be listening to music and kids screaming all night in Carnaval Court, and as I said, do not expect an uninterrupted nights sleep.

UPDATE: Called them and got the expected answer. Told them paying a ""resort fee"" when things like the pool are closed is ridiculous. 2nd year in a row we requested the block of 4 rooms be next to each other (and we booked very early) and they weren't even close. I will save up and spend extra for a nicer place next year. I am done dealing with garbage in the halls, people puking in the hall and all night parties that spill into the hall until all hours.

First and foremost, the hotel is central to everything.  Once you park your car, you can pretty much forget about it until you checkout because the Flamingo is within walking distance to everything in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip.  Anyone who's been to Vegas knows how bad the traffic can get so this is worth its weight in gold.  Second, thanks to renovations in the early 2000s, the Flamingo has a pretty nice atmosphere to it.  Sure the color schemes are quite cheesy, but don't forget this is Vegas we are talking about.  The property has a tropical feel to it and in the courtyard they even have live penguins and flamingos for you to visit.  As for the rooms, they are among the most spacious in terms of basic rooms (non-suites).  If you are taking groups, a lot of their rooms connect and there is plenty of floor space.  You'll find pretty much a lot of the standard table games in the casino, and the table minimums are pretty much whatever the going rate is (i.e. $10 blackjack on the weekends).  They have a poker room, and although it is small (~10 tables), I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes for a seat.  Now the big reason that makes me such a big fan of the Flamingo can only be experienced during the summertime-the pool!  It sprawls over 13 acres and has waterslides, waterfalls, islands, you name it.  Its definitely a great place to relax when the 100-degree heat is beating down on you.",0,0,0

Everything was going ""okay""  until tonight when I wasn't sure which elevator I needed to take to get to my room. I was IN The Flamingo. I walked up to a bar and told the bartender my room number and asked where the elevator was. He informed me the Flamingo has no guest elevators and I should go to Caesars and use their elevators. What?? I have a room in the Flamingo. Not Caesars. I'm angry even sleeping here tonight but it's already paid for. I walked maybe 20 ft to the next bartender and asked them where the elevator was. It was literally directly behind the bartender that told me they don't have elevators. I'm livid. I now can't stand this place. I have video if the management would like to see who it is. I know his name starts with a T. I'm unfortunately here for 3 nights. Never again. Lesson learned. Stay somewhere else where the employees might care just a little bit to at least tell you the elevator is directly behind them. I'm so insulted. This guy lied to me obviously for his own joy. Unless this was his first day and no one said ""turn around, there's elevators directly behind you."" I shouldn't jump the gun. Maybe it was his first day and he never actually turned around yet and whoever trained him never let him know the flamingo has more than one floor. Whatever the case may be, if a guest asks where the elevator is, maybe don't direct them to a different hotel when all their belongings are already on your property, in a room they are already having trouble finding, that's already paid for.

I was excited to stay around that area of the strip because I usually stay on the south side of the strip. I came in on a Thursday afternoon around 2:30-3pm and there was about 10 people in line in front of me. It took over an hour for us to get up to the counter and there was 6 people working behind the counter. So I don't know what the wait time was about. Once I got checked in I went up to my room which was nice and clean. My only complaint about the room was the bathroom sink had a foul odor coming from it. I didn't realize until the last night I was there that there was a rim of caked on mildew around the drain. But other than that everything else was clean in the room. The view from the room was the back of the hotel. Even though it wasn't a view of the strip it was still a view of something which was nice because I have stayed in hotels where the view consist of a building air conditioner or of another wall. 
I liked that the window went from the floor to the celling. that was pretty cool. The casino was to my surprise smaller than most other casinos in other hotels. The parking lot was ridiculous. you think that its a one way aisle in the structure and its not. there are areas where you can turn onto another aisle but no stop signs. i wouldn't be surprised if fender benders happen in there on a daily. 
 Besides the parking structure, the long wait to check in and the mildew in the sink I did enjoy my stay at the flamingo and would recommend it to a friend. its in a great location.

The rooms are very clean and simple and it has speakers, TVs in the bathroom. I really liked staying there especially for the price too.
However, when I was checking out, there were these 3 housekeepers that kept banging on our door even though we asked for a late check out and we had plenty of time. And we stayed there for 3 nights booking 2 rooms. They rushed us to leave the room. They came inside the room and waited inside while we were packing and showering.
Anyhow, since they rushed me so much I left my Tiffany's necklace right next to the sink. When I realized I was already 3 hours away from Vegas.
I called for the necklace right when I realized it, and they said they didn't find it and I should call back next day.
The next day, I called they looked at the Lost and Found for the whole floor I stayed at and they didn't find anything. I am 100% sure that I left it right next to the sink but they didn't believe me. I still haven't found it. I've stayed at other hotels on the strip and when my friends left something behind, they could always find it at Lost and Found. So if it was in the room, there is no way they can't find it unless someone took it.
By the way, we gave the housekeeper $20 tip the moment she entered the room.
Anyhow, Flamingo didn't offer any reimbursement or anything. It's not just that the necklace was expensive but it had a sentimental value to me so I'm very upset.

The casino floor is pretty cool though and for that it will not get 2 stars. This place wreaks of old school Vegas, and the rat pack were regulars here. The dining options looked good, but we did not par take.

As the oldest-standing hotel on the main strip, this place is in excellent shape, thanks to recent renovations that resulted in surprisingly chic rooms that are likewise affordable. I went to Vegas twice this year, and I stayed at the Flamingo both times--yes I know there are swankier hotels in town, but given my criteria, I honestly can't say enough good things about this one. If you're looking to strike a balance of bang for your buck, style, and location (much like me), I would definitely head straight for this place.

A few more details you might be interested in:

* At the end of July as well as in mid-December, my group and I paid less than $90 total per night to stay here. This time around, we went for one of the GO Deluxe rooms at $87.50\/night. This was a slight upgrade from the FAB Deluxe room I stayed in the last time, but only a few dollars difference and with slightly nicer amenities (larger flat screen TV, cushy white headboards for the beds, green\/pink mood lighting in the bathroom, plus another TV in the bathroom). See http:\/\/www.vegaschatter.com\/story\/2012\/2\/21\/231159\/318\/vegas-travel\/FAB+vs.+GO%3A+It%27s+Not+Even+Close for a more comprehensive comparison of the two types of rooms. If the price is still an issue, FAB Deluxe was still better than average.

* Seriously smack dab in the middle of the strip. Therefore no matter where else you want to check out on the strip, everything will be within reasonable walking distance. E.g. Caesars Palace is right across the street, the Palazzo is right next door, and the Mirage, Encore\/Wynn, Cosmopolitan, and Fashion Show Mall are just a short walk away.

* The 21 and over pool, during the hot months of the year, is super fun! When I went in the summer there was a live DJ playing house music. It was like a lowkey, slightly more mature version of MTV Spring Break. I highly recommend it.",5,0,1

PROS:
It has a decent pool
Room was clean.
Check-in was friendly
Conveniently located to the High Roller

CONS:
The family pool was closed so families and the +21 drunks had to share the same piss-riddled area. $20 for sunblock, so don't forget to bring yours!! (we did)
Our ""updated"" room only included new curtains, new rug, wood laminate.  Everything else was well-worn, scratched. Bathroom was NOT updated and DARK!
TV is super small
No mini bar.
Water from bathroom sink smelled like perm. 
Thermostat was wonky.
Could hear EVERYTHING from the adjoining room....(we had one of those rooms that could be joined with another room by an interior door).
Could smell the marijuana from another room wafting thru our vent.  
Only ONE chair in our room for 2 people---makes eating room service a bit difficult. 

We've stayed all over the Strip and wanted to stay at the Flamingo because it's one of the last originals.  There is nothing left from the original days, except maybe the sign (which is now blocked from the walkway).  

After seeing everyone else's awesome room pictures on here, I'm even more disappointed we were given such an awful room.

It was great having views of the Bellagio fountains and the hustle and bustle of Las Vegas Blvd. The room was comfortable, spacious and clean, and it included a flat screen television, a stereo system with DVD player, and an embedded television in the bathroom mirror. It was convenient having a small mini-fridge to keep drinks and snacks cold. 

From a design perspective, although I liked the stylish headboard and clean lines of the furniture, the color palette is not harmonious. A little hard to do I guess if hot pink needs to be one of your primary colors. Also, as you walk from your room into the elevators down to the lobby, it's like descending back in time through different periods. This may sound nit-picky, but if part of your trip is to take in the delights of interior design, you're going to have to walk over to the Aria or Wynn instead.

There's a gym and spa located in the hotel. It's $5 per day or $25 for three days to use the fitness equipment. It comes in handy when you want to work off some of that buffet food. Speaking of the buffet, I liked it. I especially liked having brunch here on Saturday to have all-you-can-drink champagne.

We walked into the ""suite"" which was large but had not seen a remodel since the 80's i am sure.  The carpet was stained, the bathroom door had paint peeling off of it and it smelled like smoke (non-smokers). We had reserved a remodeled room and because we had show tickets we could not go back down and deal with the issue.

The next morning we were upgraded to the room we were supposed to have and it was nicer except the bathroom had not been upgraded. The lines to talk to the front desk were super long and the staff so so.  The elevators had a ton  of trash in them every time we got in them.

- Buffet is weak and did not have much. (AVOID)
- No good channels. (1) kids channel.

My review based on the Fab Deluxe Room.

I stayed here on a Saturday and Sunday. Got here around 12pm and checked in early ($20 Fee). I ordered an extra bed ($60) and was given a room key and went into my room. The hallway seems a but rundown and the cieling is VERY low! (Anyone over 6"" may have to duck a bit!) The room was well kept and very clean. (Exactly Like their Online Picture!). The TV was a small flat Screen with no good channels and 1 kids channel. Mostly they're advertisements. The bathroom was ok. Its a cookie cutter bathroom. (Same design as the rest of the Hotels). Beds are soft and comfortable and the pillows were fluffy!

Room Service stops at 9pm and starts at 6am which is dissapointing compared to the 24 Hour Room Service at Hooters. 

Cellphone reception is TERRIBLE in the rooms! Using a Verizon Wireless Phone I could barely keep 4G (1 bar) in my room! Sometimes the signal drops all together. Inside the Casino its fine.

Wifi is $12 for ONE DEVICE. The connection is slow and just logging in was a pain. Pass on the wifi.

Their Buffet is terrible! (We had brunch) The selection was insulting to buffets. There were about 12 selections for food (Sausage, Hashbrowns, Bacon, Eggs Benedict) but over 25 selections for Salad toppings!!!! They did have a choclate fountain but it was not worth the $20 admission! Make a pass on this buffet.

The Casino is the same as the rest.

The flamingo has a Monorail station down the hall for easy access to all the strip and I highly recommend getting a pass when heading home as it will save you walking (Especially if youre at the edges of the strip!)

Did not experience the pool because it was winter and I did not experience the Flamingo Garden walkway.

We lived in Chicago so the visit to LV was for family who had moved.  Fast forward to 2011 and we are now living in San Diego (close to the Indian casinos) so the visits to Las Vegas are limited to  family gatherings or holidays.

Harrahs has seen the light and now allows dogs in some of their rooms in almost all properties and of course, the fancier the hotel property, the higher the price.  We settled on the Flamingo because of price and their remodeled rooms.

First and foremost, the improvements are at most cosmetic.  The same driveway to the hotel from the Las Vegas strip (always a hazard because you have to get pass pedestrians who are unwilling to wait to go to the next hotel or cruise the rest of the strip).  There is no other quicker way to go in the hotel driveway.  Plus, they have free valet parking.

Once we got to the hotel, things come back to my memory about the type of casino hotel, Flamingo was (and that is true, was).  It can never be restored from its former glory because it's overall theme has to stay the pink flamingos etc.  I am sure there were improvements since our last visit at least  7 or more years ago but has it really improved?  I do give props for the room, although it has seen better times, the bathroom and the beds plus the flat screen tv were in this current trend (let's say all white\/lounge with glass doors to the bathroom etc.).  The room was at least very spacious and had an interesting view of the pool below.  Apricot certainly enjoyed it.

Since we were in LV in the early summer as school is getting out or has finished, the pool on Sat has the 21 and over party vibe.  I didn't try joining that crowd as I was busy with other stuff (visiting family) etc.  Sun nite has a more normal quiet atmosphere suited for a normal hotel pool.

Props for the improvements and low minimums on the table games and trying.

With the exception of the pool Sat experience (think those reality shows on magnification 300x), I would stay here again because of the room being better than the more expensive but not as pretty or close to the strip Westin we normally stayed at.  

With more funds, we can actually stay at the newer properties, Paris (oh la la) or newer remodels Caesar's Palace (oh celine).",8,4,6

I came here 2 months ago for a friends bday, and ended up staying here for the next 3 days.  I did expect better but wasn't too impressed with the hotel itself.

When entering the hotel and getting our rooms, it was almost an hour wait due to mix up in pricing for my friends reservations and them trying to over charge due to sale tax increase....to me that doesn't seem very ethical, but whatever...

We all ended up staying on the same floor in the smoking area which was decent but could have done better in cleaning the rooms.  I mean I know its the smoking area and they possibly only do a half-fast job b\/c it IS the smoking area but they should treat it the same with every new customer sleeping there.

Flamingo did re-do the rooms which were trendy and retro looking so they get an extra star for that. But the customer service was a little weak, I kept being on hold for room service like 4x and was on hold for each time like 15mins. When receiving the food was actually pretty fast and ok tasting. (just go to the restaurants within the hotel, much better)

Even with signs telling you the locations of things I still ended up being lost within the place. By the 3rd day I got the hang of things and started knowing my way around. But too late, I was already leaving.

I do recommend the Burger Joint, food-wise, but again their customer service was really lame. It took them 20mins for our drinks and menus and the food was awesome but we had to wait again like another 35-45mins. I guess it was worth the wait...
For a fancy dinner, their restaurant 46 Steaks was very very delicious. We celebrated our friends bday dinner there and was very enjoyable place in general. A little expensive but worth it.

When leaving, again, the lines to check out was ridiculous. Even the fast check out wasn't really fast, the poor old guy doing it was backed up himself.

I booked a Fab Room with 2 Queen Beds and a strip view. The room was very clean and spacious compared to the rooms at the Linq. We had a view of Caesars and a partial view of the bellagio foundations. Bathroom was renovated from what I have seen. Some of the furniture was chipped and aged but who really cares about that.

Right now Bill's Hotel\/Casino located next door is undergoing major construction, which is shutting off one of the major parking entrances to the Flamingo making it very, very hard to park.   If you are driving to the hotel, the limited parking is a major red flag.  The entire front of the building feels like walking through a construction site.  Not pretty, not glamorous, not a great vacation destination.  The construction was also a surprise to me; it wasn't mentioned on the website.

Checking in is long and tedious.  Expect about a half hour waiting time unless you are a special member.

Some of the rooms are remodeled, some are not.  I was originally assigned an unremodeled room.  The decor was from probably the early 80's, which would be depressing but acceptable if the room hadn't been so dirty and in need of repair.  The carpeting was stained, the wallpaper was peeling, the ceiling had plaster falling off from a previous leak. 

 I complained to management and was assigned a new ""GO"" room.  On the plus side, the room was beautifully designed.  If you plan on staying there, I would definitlely suggest springing extra money for a GO room.   However, even this newly designed room had problems.  My floor-to-ceiling window was cracked - it seriously appeared as if the glass was ready to fall out (apparently double-paned as the glass on the inside was okay so at least I wasn't in danger of falling through or cutting myself).   The Denon stereo system, which looked fantastic, didn't work.  Since the room was a free upgrade from the unacceptably dirty first room, I didn't ask to be moved again.

The employees were polite, though they seemed understaffed.   It seemed some of the elevators were not working as wait times were unusually long.

We had a good time but the light situation really bugged me. As for their rewards program I'm not impressed either. I used the card at both the tables and slots and dropped $1500. Not a lot but enough and was suprised that the card comp was only $11. So unless you are a huge gambler it's really not worth even bothering with it.",0,0,0

So I'll give the upsides and downsides of staying at the Flamingo

Cons:

1.Parking was impossible to find at first. The parking structure is limited and we couldn't find additional parking at first but after calling we were told to go to the Valet and that it was free to use that. This was good and we were lucky because I think they cut the Valet off right after us. 
2. After waiting so long for parking we went to get in line to check in and the line was all the way down to the end of the shops. The lady in front of us said there was a 2 hour wait but then the manager told us that they had just put all check in attendants and managers on the floor to help speed up check in so we really only waited 40  minutes which still sucked but was way better than 2 hours. 
3. The elevators were stopping on every floor. It sucked cause we were all the way on the 20th floor but we did meet some cute guys on them so being stuck on a elevator ride with them wasn't too bad lol. I also dont think that some of the elevators were working. It was kind of funny because by the end of the weekend there was a kind of comraderie between the guests when an elevator would finally come or when  we would skip some floors. 

Pros- 
1. My go room was upgraded to a higher floor once I mentioned that it was my bday and the view was amaxing. I watched the Bellagio fountains several times from our rooms.
2. Everyone from the customer service desk to the bellhops were very friendly and good customer service is always a plus. One of the workers ( with fab eyebrows btw) saw me and my girls were getting ready to go out and told us some of the good clubs to check out. And our first bellhop told us some good sights to see like to Gold wall at the Mandarin Oriental and the Chandelier in the Cosmopolitan. 
3. The room was amazing. From what I understand the Go rooms and the Suites have have been remodeled recently. Our room was so cute! I loved the moving curtains that I could control from my bed and the tv in the bathroom . But the piece de resistance was the bed. It was like sleeping on a cloud. I wanted to pack that bed up and take it home with me .

Overall me and my girls all agreed that we would stay at the Flamingo again. You can't be the Location and the price of this Hotel. I would definintely recommend getting a GO Room. There are some kinks to work out here and I hope their elevators get worked on when we come back to Vegas in May.",1,0,0

We got a room on the second floor which was too loud as the side street had loud music going on pretty much all night. The room was basic and the washroom was old.

I booked a non-smoking room with a king. I was surprised to see an online check in option email on the morning we were to arrive. So I clicked the link and ""checked in.""  When we arrived to the front desk of the hotel, the employee assisting us informed us we had checked in online and our ""smoking room with 2 queens"" was ready.  No, no, no, no.  I informed here there was absolutely no option as to what type of room you could check into on the link that was sent to me.  Rather, it just allowed you to tell the hotel what time you were arriving.  She was extremely rude and told me ""you're not guaranteed a king.""

We get to the room which was supposed to be ""newly remodeled.""  However, they only replaced the floor, TV and added a lounge chair by the window.  All the rest of the furniture was old and horribly beat up.  Additionally, the pillows on the beds WERE HORRIBLE.

I couldn't wait until 3pm for check in so I decided to pay for the early check in. Only cost me $20.  I asked for a nice room and she upgraded me to the Habitat wing. Not knowing what it meant, I assumed it was a step above their standard rooms. I was placed in the Jamaica suite.  Upon entering, it definitely was roomy! The decor was not to my liking, had wood furniture and red velvet sofa and chairs. The floor to ceiling windows spanning the length of the living room was nice and made the room seem even bigger. The kitchenette was more modern with granite countertops, sink, microwave, mini-fridge and wet bar area. There was a full bath to the right of the living room.

The master bedroom located off the living room area was nice.  It had a window view of the strip along with a sofa and table. The master bathroom was pretty spacious with a dressing area just outside.

I took a walk outside along the natural habitat area that housed the pink flamingos, kois and other birds. A nice experience and great photo ops by the waterfall.  If you walk further you can end up in the area leading to the Linq.  It has various eateries and shops and leads to the strip.

If you're on a budget this isn't a bad place to stay.  Always ask for a free upgrade. Looks like they've done some updating with the rooms. One plus goes to hotel being located centrally on the Strip.",3,1,1

Has been is more like it. I did like the wal paper in the bathroom and the lenolium floor that looks like wood in the room. Plus the door was so heavy couldn't hear hall traffic, plus pretty sure it could be used as a blast door too.
When we arrived it was a nightmare getting parking. You  walk at least four miles from parking to check in. Use valet parking!
So many people everywhere! Has a mall feel at first, then a club feel with check in that is so loud and hot you almost have a panic attack. I do enjoy shops, cute and nice. Of course be prepared to be pressured to buy stuff from Wyndahm? Not sure how to spell it.
The room was sad. Old peeling wall paper, air conditioning was horrible. Old saggy bed with pancake type pillows. I know the place makes enough money to get decent mattresses and pillows. Of course Caesars owns it, so it's awful how bad they let it get. I do love the pink accents here and there, very nice. 
The bathroom has cracked paint on cabinet. Dirty lamp shades. Just has a dive motel feel to it.
I think I should have stayed off the strip and got a taxi. The strip is nuts! Hotel might be worth $30 a night if it was located someplace else.

Good food at Carlos and Charlies. If you want a midnight snack, the food court is good, decent; however, it is a little expensive. Johnny Rocket the best.

Negative-the bathrooms in the guest rooms do need some serious work-rust and mold all over the shower area. It appears very insanitary.

After getting off the barely functioning elevator, and ascended down the musky hallway  that smelled like bad decisions covered with perfume, we came to our room.

While it doesn't necessarily meet the same high stands as it's sister casinos, I have never reconsidered staying here after our trips. There is a lot to appreciate (as well as be disappointed in) here. 
-Location, location, location. Flamingo is centrally located and in easy walking distance to basically everything. 
-Food. I did get food poisoning from the Cafe by the habitat elevators after eating their pizza. Carlos and Charlies is just ok, Margartitaville is cheesy and great. 
-Pools. Both trips now the pools have been closed. However, I appreciate being able to use the neighboring properties (Paris, Linq, Ceasers).
-Flamingo habitat. I really liked seeing all of the exotic birds and other creatures. They seem to be well cared for and I do hope that's the truth.
-Rooms. We have experienced both the outdated old rooms as well as the newer GO rooms. My husband preferred the older room simply because of it's size. It was at least twice the size of the GO room we stayed in. However, I found that room to be old (duh), dark, and way too far from the elevator. Basically a full  5 minute walk to our room. I really liked the GO room. We had a great view of the High Roller and gardens, the electronic shades were great, plenty of closet and dresser drawer space, and much closer to the elevator. We upgraded at our checkin this time around ($15 a day) to get that room which I wasn't thrilled with but I didn't want to end up in that old, smoky, dingy room again! 
The Flamingo has great history and it's on the smaller side which you will appreciate when you realize you're walking 10 miles a day on the strip. I would definitely stay here again.",4,0,0

My wife and I took turns standing in the outrageous line.  It took well over an hour to check in (in our winter clothes after a long flight).  We put up with attitude from the clerk when we complained about how long it took to check in.  The length of the check- in line didn't improve as the week progressed (terrible for other travelers).  

The hallway to the room didn't seem very clean (21st floor).  The carpet was not flat and bunched up in areas.  The carpet was actually being held together by grey duct tape in other areas.  It was literally a 4-5 minute walk to and from our room from the poorly placed elevator (which really adds up as the week goes along).

The sink was completely clogged.  We called the front desk to have this fixed.  They put me through to maintenance, who never picked up and never came to fix the problem.  

There was no bathroom fan.  Took forever for the steam on the mirrors to clear.  My travel partner accidently left the door open after a ""number two"" and the whole hotel room ended up stinking.  

Housekeeping did a nice job changing the sheets and making the beds.  They never picked up our garbage or empty bottles\/ cans\/ glasses.  By the end of our trip, our room looked like a recycling depot.  

The Mexican restaurant had excellent food and a great breakfast.  Nice patio.  Poor service.  There was no bathroom in this restaurant.  You had to leave and go to one of the facilities in the casino if you needed to go.  Who builds a restaurant with no bathroom?! There was no bathroom in the tiny food court either.  

There only seemed to be two bathrooms supporting the entire front desk\/ casino area.  The conditions of these bathrooms were appalling.  They were overcrowded.  Lines for the urinals.  The stalls didn't seem like they were ever cleaned.  Graffiti on all the stall walls.  The door mechanisms on several stalls were broken and the doors didn't stay closed.  Other casino bathrooms were clean, modern and it smelt like pleasant air freshener.

We were excited to spend some time at the pool and get some sun.  The gate to the main pool was closed.  There were no signs indicating why it was closed or if and when it would open.  People were still lined up and waiting there anyway.  This is at 11am on a weekday and it was 30 degrees out!  

The concierge desk advised us that their tiny little family pool was open.  We went looking for and found this pool.  There didn't appear to be an entrance to this pool.  We had to have the concierge desk explain how to find the little ramp that takes you to this pool.  There was a line up so that they could check your bags to make sure you weren't bringing outside drinks (which has never seemed to be a problem at any other Vegas hotel we stayed).  There were no seats at this pool.  We left the pool area in frustration.  

When we came back later, the main pool had opened.  There still wasn't a single seat open though.  Not one.  Definitely not two together so my wife and I could sit together.  There were seats piled up in the corner that the staff couldn't be bothered to put out.  I grabbed a couple chairs off the pile and put them out myself.  My chair was broken, of course.  So I couldn't recline.  Every day we went to the pool and struggled to find a place to sit (some days we would just got frustrated and quit).

The Flamingo tower obstructs the sun from shining on the pool area for a great part of the day.    This is probably why the swimming pool water is ice cold.  

There are several places in the casino where you are stopped and harassed to go to time share presentations (in exchange for free show tickets) by overly aggressive\/ obnoxious salesperson.  

The gaming machines in the Flamingo are old and out of date.  Not like the modern\/ touchscreen games in other casinos.  We didn't have much luck on the machines at the flamingo and didn't find them very fun to play.  They seemed to be programmed to just take your money offering nothing in return.  We had fun gaming at the airport and other casinos. 

They make you stand in an hour long line to check out where you are jabbed with a resort fee.  When the check- out agent asked how our vacation was, we told her ""horrible.  Because of the quality of this establishment.""  She scoffed at that.

I have been to Vegas many times and stayed on many strip hotels.  Our experience here was terrifying compared to other similarly priced hotels\/ casinos on the strip.   How this place received any 4 star ratings makes me question the whole rating system.

I think the City of Las Vegas should build a giant crane, pick up the flamingo and put it off the strip somewhere.  It is taking up good real estate and preventing a good casino\/ hotel from being built on that spot in the center of the stip.",0,0,0

I stayed at the Flamingo last year with no problems so i wanted to stay again this year despite my daughter warning me of recent reviews. The first problem I encountered was someone in a nearby room smoking marijuana for 2 days. They smoked so much that it permeated my room. How can this go on and the hotel not know about it. Second problem only the sheers closed but the drapes didn't close. We called hotel customer service and was assured the problem would be corrected. We made repeated calls to hotel customer service to no avail.We checked in on April 24th and out on April 27th and the drapes still didn't close. They ended up giving us two $50 food and beverage credit and comping 1 night.  I stayed in the spa area and the bank of elevators by the spay had 6 elevators and only 3 of them worked the entire time we were there. But the worst part came at checkout. The desk clerk, Suzie Rodrigues, had a really bad attitude and all but called my daughter a liar when she said we had unresolved issues and that previous customer service people had given us two $50 credit and room comp. Suzie then went and talked to the manager at the other end of the counter, Sean Larson, who never came over to see what the problem was. Suzie told him thet they never give two $50 credits (despite it was in the files). We had the name of every employee that we spoke with! He never addressed us once! Finally, they reluctantly gave the comps.Customer service at the front desk stinks. Instead of asking if we had a nice stay the first thing Ms. Suzie did was to growl ""what are you here to do"". I don't go to Las Vegas and spend lots of money to be treated like that. I spent money in the Flaming casino, the shops and food places.

Flamingo is in the heart of the strip. I can honestly say it's one of my favorite hotels in Vegas -- Mainly because of the Go Rooms and the location. 

Check-in to the hotel can take a while (depending on what time you arrive) but with a drink in my hand I don't mind ;-) 

Keep in mind that Flamingo is renovated and it doesn't look as bad as it looks from the outside. I will admit, when I first stayed at Flamingo with some friends I was a little skeptical. But since I was on a budget, I didn't care. The deluxe room is just ok. Nothing out of the ordinary. 
Now, the Go deluxe room is a whole different story. It is a little pricier but I think it's worth it. It's very pink. Yet, I'm not a fan of pink but I kinda liked this pink.....weird I know. The Go deluxe rooms are funky. Love the decor and the TV in the bathroom...how awesome is that! Love the 42-inch TV in the room. The bed was very comfortable and just a cool room. 

The pool is just too much fun. They have a slide that I went on over and over again. The pool is very big and it did get a little crowded at times. 

This place is awesome! I try to never stay at the same place twice, but this hotel is just too cool.",0,0,0

It's a bit old but the rooms were upgraded and they been working to make the place look better. The casino is a bit old style and small compare to the mega casinos. My GF likes to stay here because she doesn't get lost. We were given a free GO suite for our stay and it was very nice. The gift basket was a nice touch from the casino host.

The show room is a bit small also but no complaints. The pool is one of the nicer one in my opinion

I have good luck here.",0,0,0

I probably go to Vegas about 6x\/year and decided that I wanted to try a different hotel. (I usually stayed at TI or MGM but now I'm switching to PH). After a long day of flying from the midwest I finally got to the hotel and wanted to get settled before we started hitting it. The check in line was long and there were few clerks.

After being called up to the desk I gave the lady my ID and my conf #. She took my ID and went into the back room and disappeared for literally 20 minutes. I became annoyed at this point as my reservation was already paid for so I asked a clerk who wasn't busy to see what the hell was going on but she just gave me a blank stare. 

After waiting 25 minutes at this point the lady returns with some pygmy manager in a cheap suit. He proceeds to meekly tell me they overbooked and asked if I would be willing to stay at another Harrah's property. I told him the only place I'd move to at this point was Caesar's. He said they can offer me a room at Harrah's and they will comp me a buffet. Hahahahaha really dude? Thanks for wasting my time gfy! I told him to give me my room key or give me a refund and I'll call up the MGM. They gave me a room key. I felt like I was stuck at the DMV or something.

The room I booked was a GO suite and there was nothing sweet about it. Stains everywhere, dusty, old dirty furniture, bad smell, and there was nothing new or renovated about it in my opinion. The vibe of the hotel was really lame. We didn't hang out there at all. Not  much of a young crowd and not much action.

This was the first and last time I stayed at the Flamingo.

Only pro: No resort fees.
Cons: Everything else...",1,2,0

On the plus side, the location is awesome.  Since it was the first hotel on the strip, everything was built around it.  Its central to everything and being close the the Bellagio and Caesars allows you to take advantage of their much nicer resorts without paying to stay their.  The history of the hotel is interesting as well if you can find a tour guide or employee to tell you about it.

That's where it stops.  Harrahs casinos are no longer resort fee free.  They used to campaign against resort fees, but now they are worse that the competition.  M-Life still has a few casinos (Luxor and Excalibur) without wifi.  Flamingo has wifi, but charges you PER DEVICE.  The resort fee is supposed to cover the use of resort amenities like the pool, gym, and wifi.  But, its an additional charge ($13.99) if you connect to the wifi with an additional device.

Flamingo also has a really bad selection of restaurants.  Margaritaville is pretty good, but after that there is nothing worth checking out.  Their show selection is laughable (Donnie and Marie... still) and their gaming areas are subpar.  

If you are looking for a cheap pool party, Flamingo is a decent choice.  If you aren't a twenty-something looking to get drunk at the pool then you will not enjoy the Flamingo.

Finally, if you are staying here, do yourself a favor and pay the extra $20 or so to upgrade to a GO Suite.  These are much newer, higher in the tower, have a decent tv and a fridge.  The standard rooms are beat up and dated.  

Pass on the Flamingo.  Even with the low rates its not worth it.",1,1,0

I was able to book a very low rate ($30 a night), and when we arrived they offered us an upper level upgraded room with a strip view of $30 more.  Usually, I don't take the upgrades, but I also knew that a similar view from any other hotel would be well over $100 (possibly over $200), so I took it.

Anyway, the room was very nice (we were in room 20096 for those looking for a specific recommendation).  My only complaint is the carpet is very worn out and needs to be replaced. The bed was very nice and the bathroom included a tv in the mirror.  Oh the room has a very good sound system, so make sure you bring along a cable to plug in your MP3\/smart phone. 

One of the best features of the Flamingo is the pool.  It is surrounded with palm trees, so if you easily burn (like me) you can enjoy the heat and get some shade.  In the evening, we were thankful for the great location and walked all around the Strip.

Yes, it isn't as fancy or nice as the Bellagio, but if you can snag a good price, it is well worth staying!!",2,0,0

I don't even know where to start, I'm so appalled by this place.  You can't even find the entrance for parking to this place it's so ridiculous, and when you do, if you go to valet, you wait forever, forever like, I applied my powder, bronzer, a little more powder, eyebrows AND eyelashes on in the time it took, and we still sat a bit after I was done.  Upon entering the place it was refreshing to see the cute new interior that included pink striped wall paper.  We made our way up to the lobby, and found our way to the bank of elevators where there were 10-15 people waiting, there were at least 10 elevators so it surprised me that people were waiting.  One of the elevators was out of order, I'm assuming, as it had a wet floor sign in front of it and the door was opened.  When we FINALLY were able to catch an elevator we realized that there was no sensor in the doors that opened it automatically when someone stuck their hand between the doors, that's fuckin dangerous, say I didn't know that and I tried to catch the elevator by slipping in and it totally closed on me and my pregnant ass! When inside the elevator it MOVES a few inches when the doors open to floors, it'll drop a couple of inches.  Since the elevators take so damn long so many people will pile in uncomfortably and people use their survivor tactics to catch an elevator and get off.  We only had to go to the 5th floor which was great, but guess what, if you don't push the button before you get there, you have to go with everyone all the way up to their floor and then all the way down picking people up until you get to the 5th floor, fuckin ridiculous.  When we got to the 5th floor we got out and looked down at the carpet and it's all lifted up and wrinkled, it's dangerous, someone could trip and fall.  The room wasn't too bad, it was a cute little suite with a very clean bed with white sheets and a comforter, the couches were cute but didn't seem to match the theme of the hotel, as they were striped red, gold, and black.  The carpet in the room, however was't wrinkled like the hallways, which was nice.  

After getting ready, waiting for an elevator, and making our way through the hotel and outside to the chapel we quickly realized where much of their money was going, and that was to their beautiful chapel.  Everything about their chapel was gorgeous! Everything around their chapel smelled like bird poop and stagnant water. 

Also, did I mention I took the stairs from the 5th floor? As we were running out of light to photograph the wedding party, I led the charge to take the stairs since the elevators were taking so long.  Their stairwell was disgusting, if they aren't going to put money into fixing their elevators or making them more efficient then they should probably use that money for the stairwell and create a stairwell that leads directly to the lobby, because the one we took lead to a door outside of the hotel into the street.  At some point going down an employee opened one of the doors and told us we were at the 3rd story, and that we couldn't go into that door because it was an employee door, or something like that, so we went all the way down to the street.

Don't come here, stick to one of the bigger hotels on the strip, there are much safer, nicer hotels  who you can find much more easily and who also charge the same rates.",0,0,0

So this year, I thought, hey wouldn't it be cool to stay at the Flamingo where there seems to be a party going on 24\/7?  Right about the party, wrong about the rooms.

The rooms were below average and quite frankly disgusting.  My boyfriend insisted on a smoking room, so I don't know if that makes a different in the nastiness grade.  The first thing I noticed was the blanket on the end of the bed.  I turned it over to search for bed bugs and found a crusty, questionable, white stain.  Gross.  Next, I inspected the couch by the window.  It was covered in cigarette ashes, so I turned the cushion over and was still grossed out by all the debris under the seat.  

The bathroom looked like it had taken me back in a time machine to 1975.  The newest item in the bathroom was the dinky hair dryer.  The light fixtures were missing pieces out of them and the caulking looked like the original.  

On a positive note, the pools were nice, but packed full.  The grounds around the hotel are beautifully landscaped with a flamingo habitat and a duck pond with koi fish.  They also have a Macaw parrot that is cool.

Waking through the casino area was so stinky and I dreaded that every day. We walked through other casinos and didn't feel the same way.

We did have a problem because we requested a non-smoking room, which was got, but it still REEKED of cigarettes.  I cannot stand the smell of smoke, and I am used to a city where smoking is banned pretty much everywhere (thank you Bloomberg).  We went downstairs and asked for another room, which they gave us, but basically said that they cannot keep people from smoking in the non-smoking rooms, so there is a chance they may all smell like that.  Wonderful.  Luckily, the room smelled pretty clean.

Had no problem with the cleanliness overall.  It is not a new hotel, which I knew, so I thought it was pretty good.

The over 21 pool is great, and I was surprised that there were a lot more people my age than I had been told going in.  The all-ages pool, while great, is in the shade most of the day, so that kinda stunk if you wanted to lay out.

Restaurants are ehh.  I don't really mind going elsewhere to eat though.  I don't gamble, so can't say much in the way of that.

The best thing about the hotel is by far the location.  Center strip.  I don't think any hotel has a better location than the Flamingo.  We walked everywhere.

Random side note, we came in from the pool one day and there was music playing in the lobby...a lot of the staff was dancing in the lobby to the Cha Cha Slide and a few other dances they may have made up.  It was pretty funny\/entertaining.

Actually going back to Vegas this year and we were planning on staying here again, but I got a deal through work at the Mirage, so staying there mostly because there are more people my age and everyone we met last year was staying at the Mirage.  Otherwise, not a bad deal and a lot cheaper than the newer hotels.",1,1,1

We stayed Wednesday night thru Saturday for on average $100\/room if you include the daily resort fees. Definitely one of the more affordable hotels including that Friday night. Most places were asking $225+ just for that night before the additional resort fees.

The location is perfect, right in the middle of the strip. Unfortunately, because we were right in the middle of the strip, we were equal distances from two different Walgreen's that were about a 20 minute walk each way north and south. Our option for soda was a $3 cup at the pizza place in the lobby or a $6 two-liter at their convenience store. I know what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas, but how did no one tell anyone else about these awful prices?!

The rooms were okay. Some of our outlets had exposed wires, the bathroom door lock button was missing it's cover, but nothing too end of the world. We had a pretty poor view for the cheapest room but another couple stayed with us and their view was much more pleasing to the eye. Luck of the draw, I guess.

We signed up for the buffets for one day. This was probably the best part. We had breakfast at the Flamingo itself overlooking their zoo area filled with live flamingos, other birds, and some huge fish in the waters. That was a picturesque way to start the day.

Nothing particularly bad about this hotel. No legendary tales either. Since this was our first time in Vegas, we spent most of the time walking around the city. 

Next time, we'll likely pay the extra $30-$40\/night and stay at the Paris. We walked through there and it was much cooler (literally, must have been 72 degrees compared to 78 at the Flamingo), felt like it had a larger casino, and their 'Streets of Paris' themed mall was incredible to walk through.",0,0,0

I came to Vegas for thanksgiving\/ my birthday weekend. I cancelled other reservations to stay at this hotel because the pictures and location looked great. I seriously regret staying here. My entire birthday celebration was ruined! 

Upon arrival, valet was full and unclear where to go and where to wait. 

I reserved a standard GO room, but upon arrival was placed into a handicapped room with a hospital bathroom. Very cold and gross.

I called to request a blanket and they ran out. The pillows were pieces of foam, I called to request soft pillows, they brought me another set of foam pillows and I was told this is my only pillow option. So no good pillows and no blankets, and they still want to charge me $33 resort fee, even though I received no amenities. 

I had to sleep on the hard pillows and woke up with a bad back and now need to go see a chiropractor.

I went downstairs to speak with someone about my bad experience with the pillows and hope that they would help me out and make my stay better. I explained that all I want was some good pillows and blankets. The manager (Shaun) had nothing to offer and laughed at my request. He said he would look into it but he never followed through and never called me. I inquired about transferring me to another one of their properties, and shaun told me they would not and that other properties have the same type of pillows. This is a lie. Shaun the manager lied to me. I had called other properties and specifically asked if they have feather down pillows, and they have them. 

I don't even know if they waived my resort fee but I had to go out and buy my own pillow for $70 because the manager Shaun did not cAre at all about my request. How hard is it to get me a good pillow! How hard is it to make the customer happy? Terrible customer service. I have never stayed at such a terrible hotel in Vegas.

The Go-room we had, in supposedly new section in the Habitat was horrible.  Floors were dirty, the room smelled like pot and the air\/fan did not work.  We contacted the hotel front two times, once in person the same day we got there and the girl said she would have a manager call me on my cell phone since there was not one available and we were on our way out.  The second call was a day before we were leaving.  The stuffiness and smell were especially bad that day.  No one ever addressed our concern.  No one ever attempted to make it right when checking out either.  I am not used to dealing with hotels like this, I'm used to hotels bending over backwards to make you happy.  I am really shocked at their lack of concern.  I would be hard pressed to stay here again, they'd have to really assure me of great accommodations.

I will say also that the GoPool is very pretty.  It would be SO much better if they kept it clean though.  If you are swimming in the pool and look under the day beds that are all over they are packed with garbage (empty cans\/bottles etc.) underneath them.  The pool closes at 5 PM daily.  They have plenty of time to clean up.  Out of the four service girls waiting on guests only two of them smiled and were friendly.  I never seen such slow, lazy girls!

Stayed here over NASCAR weekend back in March...not that I knew it was NASCAR weekend at the time...

Stayed in a GO Room on the 18th floor. While I didn't have a Strip View, I had a view of the pool and habitat areas, which was equally as good. Got a deal on it too...around $86.50 avg\/night with my Total Rewards discount! It didn't have a tub as I was hoping but those seem to be a dime a dozen...sometimes you get one, most of the time you don't.

Arrived at around 2pm on a Thursday and check-in didn't take all that long, maybe like 20 minutes. They also have automated machines at the front desk if you're looking to avoid the lines. I did see some long lines at the front desk at certain times of the day though.

Enjoyed the vibe of the hotel and the casino...even if the slot machines were tight as hell. Thankfully, you can access the Strip from the casino in less than 5 minutes, and wonderful joints such as O'Shea's and Harrah's were very very close. It's also connected to the Monorail if you're looking to head to MGM Grand or casinos located further north.

Everything you need under one roof, definitely. I also recommend Margaritaville and Burger Joint if you're looking for some eats, but there's a lot of other joints... like LA Subs, Johnny Rockets, and the Buffet (which I didn't get to try this time around.)

Loved the bartenders over at Bugsy's Bar. They were pretty heavy-handed with the booze and kept the drinks coming while playing VP. Was a great spot to just chill, smoke, and lose a little cash.

They need to fix the elevators in the parking garage though. I swear, they must've been as old as the hotel. I was heading back to my rental on the 6th floor one day and the lights just went out...like hell.",0,0,0

Basically the flamingo destroyed my would be wonderful visit to Las Vegas. Lets start at the beginning (hold on to your hats this is going to be a long one). Parking is a nightmare, they're ""remodeling"" and self park was literally full up to the roof top parking, frustrated as shit, I decided to valet. 

Check in was horrendous five people working the front desk at four thirty pm when check in is at four. Seriously? Someone here is being stupid...pretty much took an hour to get to the front. The woman who was helping me was monotone and rude, her tone was extremely condescending. I felt like an intruder instead of a guest. 

The room I booked, a king go deluxe with strip view was sold out. They offered the pet stay king go room I said okay. The room smelled like dog pee, and my ""strip view"" was looking straight into someone's hotel room this is NOT what I paid extra for. In a rage I stormed back down to the front desk and demanded not only explanation but a room change as well. They irritated me so much I told them to cancel my third night (I ended up staying at Luxor and had a much better experience). 

So they moved me to a double queen strip view, but begrudgingly and told me to come the next day from 11-1 to change rooms for a king (foreshadowing). The view was nice ill give them that, the right side of the room had a familiar stench, I couldn't quite figure it out until I noticed the large stain on the floor next to the bed. Silly me, it was the smell of throw up! I was tired of being a bitch and didn't want to change rooms yet again so I slept on the left side of the bed. 

I woke up bright and early (11)and requested a room switch, unfortunately they wouldn't have a room until 1. Okay, I go gamble and return at 245....the room still isn't ready! The anger was boiling inside me, how incompetent can this hotel be? A mix of angry words and frustrations later they offered me a room on the 28th floor but instead of strip view, I would be looking at the bellagio fountains. Excellent. 

My room is nudged in the corner between THREE staff only doors that kept opening and closing all night. The bathroom had no curtain and no step so when I showered the whole bathroom flooded and with wet feet I stepped onto the carpet in my room. Infuriating. The morning of checkout I ewas rudely awoken at 8 AM by construction above my head and across my room. 

Enough is enough I packed my shit and left pissed as hell. No one offered an upgrade, refund, or anything to help mend the situation when I was visibly angry. I will never stay at the Flamingo again, such a shame because its a wonderful peice of Las Vegas history.",4,0,0

This hotel is  worth more than what you pay. Every time I go to Vegas, it will be at the Flamingo because if it ain't broke, why fix it.

1. Stay at the Flamingo
2. Sign up for ""Total Rewards"" on Flamingo website
3. Fly to Vegas on Southwest Airlines super cheap, bags fly free
4. Look up ""Las Vegas Guest List"" on Yelp! and register to sign on Chris Hornak's guest list which is free to get in free to the hottest clubs in Vegas (check out my review on him for details)
5. If you don't do #4, your an idiot! I got into Pure, Tryst, and XS. 

More about Flamingo ...
Buffet is good $20-$25 lunch dinner
Food court has Johnny rocket, Chinese (don't recommend), sub sandwich place, and a pizza place which I recommend the BBQ Chicken pizza. 
There is a convenient store (sells bandaids) and wine&spirits which sells alcohol for same as Walgreens down the street. Looking at $4 for a 24 ounce talk can. 
Also always buy the cheapest seats for Vegas shows because the venues are so small that 9 out of 10 times there is not a bad seat in the house. In fact a lot of the shows don't sell out so they end up moving everyone up anyways.
The Flamingo pool is beautiful. 
A taxi trip to either end of the strip from Flamingo is $10.

We decided on the Flamingo, as it was within our budget, and we heard good things about it. The worst thing we heard about it was that it was an older hotel, but old doesn't necessarily mean bad, so based on reviews and personal recommendations (a few of my co-workers recommended it), we went with the Flamingo.

Well, I do not recommend it, and unless I get a super cheap deal, I would not stay here again. 

First, the room was quite big (unnecessarily large, actually), but there was very little light! The only lights, aside from the bathroom light, were three lamps--two bedside lamps and one lamp on a desk.  Not enough for a room that large, and the lamps were too far away to give any light by the entrance. 

At the entrance of the room by the door, there were full length mirrors (points for that), but because there was no light, they were useless. Whoever designed the room was a fucking moron. 

Second, if you were charging your phone, you couldn't access it while in bed. The outlets were too far away from the bed to allow you to plug in your phone and place them on the bedside tables. Very annoying if you wanted to quickly check the time or your email. This may seem like a minor thing, but it irritated both of us. Poor room design. 

Third, there was no hot water. Lukewarm, not quite hot water, yes, but no hot water.  I did not have one refreshing, enjoyable shower while in Vegas. 

Fourth, I could hear the people in the next room. (Sounded like a bachelorette party or girls' vacation. Ugh.)  Quietness is my number one priority in hotels, and this hotel didn't cut it. However, I wasn't bothered by external noise, which I was concerned about.  (I was afraid of hearing noise from the casino or concerts.) 

Fifth, the elevators were terrible. They were slow, and not adequate for a hotel of that size.  Sometimes you'd be waiting nearly ten minutes for one! 

Lastly, the wifi sucked. It kept cutting out and was very unreliable.  It is ""free"" (although you pay a pretty high daily ""resort fee""), but I was charged for one day of wifi, but luckily it was easy to get the charged removed.  (Always check your bill!)

We were in a Fab room on the 4th floor which was nicely renovated except for the bathroom. The bed was really comfortable, in-room thermostat helped control the temp, and it was very spacious. They did a laminate wood flooring that made it much nicer than old carpet. The bathroom definitely left a little to be desired, so if a fancy bathroom is important to you, go elsewhere (or maybe another upgraded room). 

Amenities: The pool is wonderful, the connection to the Linq really expands the immediate food offerings (In-N-Out is right outside!) and the central strip location gives so much access without having to walk for hours. I used to stay Downtown and this is a big step up for saving time getting around. Stay away from this food court, there are much more delicious and cheap offerings nearby.

The furnitue is so banged up it looks like they picked it up off the street.  The covers to the outlets were ALL broken, talk about a safety hazard.  Shower is disgusting and has next to no water pressure.  The cabinets that were supposed to be sealed shut are falling open, exposing the underside of the sink.  Just plain dirty.  I felt like I was going to catch something funky in this room.  Probably the only hotel on the strip that doesnt give conditioner as a toiletries, instead you get ""conditioning shampoo"" that left my hair feeling like straw.  The toilet ran all night and the AC sounded like a semi truck going through our room.  And to top it off their slots don't pay out.  Their pillows are flat, but i will say their bed is pretty comfortable.  Valet is a disaster in and of itself.  45 minute wait to return our car that had ready been in valet earlier in the day.  Valet was never like this when it was free, now I pay to sit in line.  And to top it off, Caesar properties don't share parking like MGM properties do.  So that parking I paid at Flamingo is ONLY good at flamingo.  Customer service stinks.  Order extra pillows and they bring extra towels.  Overall a horrible experience.  And  that was just our room.  Our group had a suite and other rooms too.  The WiFi in the suite was out all weekend and we had another room get flooded by their running toilet.  Never again Flamingo, never again!",1,2,0

What's the deal with the parking structure?! Worst design ever! And half of the spots are reserved for valet and the Hilton. Really?! This is Vegas. Knock it down and build a better one! 

Oh, and of course the valet was full at 10:30pm. So pissed and so frustrated after circling around the lot for a parking spot. I just drove for 3+ hours, and all I wanted to do is check-in and sleep.

The check-in line was ridiculously long, but it was Christmas week so it was understandable.

As we got in the elevator, someone else was getting out around the 12th floor... It looked pretty scary when those elevator doors opened... The lighting was dim, the carpet was dark... Eeek!! But luckily we were on the 25th floor. And when the elevator doors opened, I see a bright hallway and elegantly tiled floors. Whew!!

The room was not bad at all. Very clean and modern. Bright room with a big flat screen TV, with a little 2.1 sound system. The windows has a electric switch for the drapes. The bathroom has a frosted glass sliding door. There's a TV embedded in the bathroom mirror, with a Bose ceiling speaker. Modern sink - like a bowl on the counter. Separate shower and tub. The king sized bed is soft, with lots of soft pillows. Comfy.

Okay... Here's my rant... The resort fees. $20 per day. And for what?! Phone? In today's day and age, who uses a telephone? Internet? They only allow access to 1 device per day. For 1 person maybe it'll work... But serioulsy... how often would one go to Vegas and stay by themself? If you're going to charge me $20\/day, at the very least you let me use WIFI on all my devices.

Overall... meh. Only paid $40 for a 2 night stay on Christmas. I suppose I can't complain too much.",14,7,8

I stayed there for the LVBDI over Sept 5-8 and had a group convention rate.  Even with the regular rates for the Flamingo, it still stays firmly in the mid-priced hotel range for the strip.  With the amenities it has (pool, spa, food court, restaurants, garden area) it really is a good value for the money.  Yes, it's old and the renovation didn't seem to take care of the hallway carpet or the bathroom cabinets, but if you're looking for new then you've come to the wrong hotel.

I had a FAB room with two beds that looked out on the strip and it was perfectly acceptable and cleaned each day.  The walls are thin and the large window area does let in some noises from the strip so bring ear plugs if you're a light sleeper.

With check-in\/out, I had a diamond card as one of the convention directors so the VIP check-in was quick and easy.  If you don't have a diamond card and do not need any kind of consideration with your room, try the automated check-in\/out that is to the side of the hotel check in desk.  I used that last year and it was much better than standing in the long line.

As already noted, as they work on the Linq construction the parking garage and valet is only for the hotel guests and convention attendees.  However, Bill's right next door usually has open spots and is an easy walk right to the casino.  Note that the best access to the garage and valet is not off Las Vegas Boulevard but at the back of the casino off Audrie Street.",1,0,0

It won't have all of the bells and whistles of the megaresorts, but it has a lot more to offer than the budget hotels.  Call it a nice medium.

I've been to Vegas maybe 30 times and I've grown into a more relaxing pace, which the Flamingo is good for.  It's big enough to offer a lot of services but not too big where you're walking 5 minutes to get from place to place.  The casino, elevators, and restaurants are all close by.  The staff are friendly and the people are relaxed.

It's probably not the best option if you're looking for amazing nightlife or a wild weekend, but it's centrally located so all of those things are close by if that's why you want.  Great access to the beautiful Paris and Bellagio, and City Center is a couple of walkways away.

The rooms are the same, much better than the budget hotels but obviously a bit older.  The renovations are nice and the size is good, and so is the bed.  The bathroom is small if that's important to you.

No coffee makers in the room, so line for a bad very overpriced cup of coffee was about 30min each day. Hotel has huge potential.

It's a tough rating to give because I also rated Aria a 4 as well, and most people would not put these 2 hotels in the same category.

However, Aria is advertised as a super luxurious hotel and Flamingo is just another ""cheap"" hotel on the strip.

Well, maybe it's because of the low expectations but to me it's a 4. Since it's not that popular, lines weren't an issue. 

The rooms have been upgraded and I think they did a great job. Mediocre beds, they stayed with the color scheme but added some modern twists to it. obviously not the most trendy, but for what you pay for its' a great value. I found the day bed by the window very comfortable to lay on.

The location is right int he middle of the strip. You can take a walk to Caesar's Forum shops, and planet hollywood's miracle mile pretty easily.

Downstairs there's a solid cheap late night hamburger spot. Nothing fancy but it's cheap and readily available.

Casino is nothing to rave about, subpar especially when Caesar's and Bellagio are right there. But if you're balling on a budget, these tables would be the way to go.

We purchased two of your Fab Luxury Rooms which are very misleading from your on-line photos. We had connecting rooms  . There were several major issues with our stay as you will see listed below.We are very upset at the level of customer service and accommodations of a major hotel such as the Flamingo with a huge reputation on the Vegas strip. 
Room Issue
First off the room photos on your website are misleading I upgraded to your Fab Luxury suite only to find it was no where near ""Fab"". We entered our first room to only find the head board off the wall and on the floor and the pillows at the end of bed as you can see in the attached photo. So your staff was accommodating and moved us to another room, but that was not a good first impression and we waited like 45mins to 1hr to be moved as we sat in this room. So we move to another room connecting 20138 and 20140 only to find holes in the wall and a hole punched in the bathroom door as you can see in the attached photos. At this point we were so disappointed and tired and your hotel was too full to move to another connecting room. We went down to talk to the guest service mgr. Cassandra and she offered us a $30 credit to the hotel which I think was a slap in the face considering how much we spent on our rooms and the inconvenience of moving from one room to the next. She also offered to move us again which at this point was useless we asked just to have maintenance come up and repair the damage while we were out for the day. We were ensured that maintenance will be up to repair. Well with that said we checked out with the room looking just how it did in the attached photos. It is very un professional to not follow up with your guest on the status if the repair was going to happen or not. I understand your do not charge resort fees, but I see why people pay resort fees to get great customer service and not TWO damaged rooms!!!! 
Parking
We pulled in to Valet parking both nights of our stay to only find the Valet was FULL and only Diamond Customers can valet. Which is so unprofessional if you know you are limited on parking you need to refuse parking to visitors and accommodate your paying customers. I was told to park in the self parking structure across the street. So we proceed to the parking structure only to drive around from top to bottom over 30 mins looking for a parking space. After our frustration we go back to valet to tell them there is no parking in the structure and not only was I there their were several very upset guest there too looking for parking. At this point I was so over my stay at this hotel, so in disbelief I was told to park at either Caesar's Palace or MGM Hotel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! First of all I cannot believe that you would send your guest to another hotel chain to find their own parking. I went to guest services and spoke with Charles the manager and we were told you lost a parking structure so basically its nothing you can do!!!! I cannot believe that a huge million dollar hotel chain does not have a contingency plan for busy summer months and accommodating your guest with parking. Does MGM know your sending your guest to park at their hotel????That is so tacky and unprofessional. Also, we confirmed you do not offer any type of shuttle for the guest your sending to these other hotels. We felt basically like its not our problem so go find your own parking. You should let your guest know your parking situation up front and not leave them hanging after they spent their money to stay with you. So I had to park at another hotel blocks and blocks away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and walk to your hotel Saturday night at 1am!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am super irritated!!! We also were leaving the next morning sooooooooooooooooooo we had to get our car and come back to pick up our bags!!!! Never ever in my life at any hotel in Vegas have I experienced such NONSENSE!!!!!!!!!!
Overall
Our stay and experience at the Flamingo was very bad and disappointing. You were not accommodating and your hotel did not follow through on any of its commitments to your customers. I also met one lady in valet and other man on the elevator who shared the same experience. Also your facility needs to be cleaner I have attached photos of your elevator which also had graffiti and the dirty carpet in your hall ways. I plan to put this on yelp and other customer websites of the dissatisfaction of your hotel. Your customer service is very unacceptable and working in the Aerospace industry and serving customers on a daily basis. Customer satisfaction is number one...You need to re-evaluate your facility and put in place various contingency plans for all these types of situations. Its not fair to your valet staff and guest services staff to have to deal with the back lash of customers because of poor planni",9,1,1

It was nice looking, but definitely could have been cleaner. They only provide low quality shampoo (no conditioner) so I advise bringing your own. The rooms were cleaned and restocked every day, but the skimped on the towels. They really mess with the cellphone reception in the building so you have to pay $20 per day for Wi-Fi. As far as the rest of the hotel goes, you have to dodge sales people in the lobby continuously which gets very annoying very fast. They will actually walk after you. The pool was okay. Nothing spectacular. They do a full bag check getting in and you can't bring your own drinks in. The line took some time and there is no cover from the sun while waiting. I feel like i could go on about little things, but the one thing that made a return to The Flamingo a total deal breaker was the fact that not only did an employee knock on our door hours before checkout to wake us up to get out, but she proceeded to use her key to open the door  seconds later. What an unfortunate way to end the trip. 
Leaving this hotel, we are still unclear what time checkout is since every time we see contradicts one another, and aren't sure if a random charge is going to crop up since they don't make it clear what you are paying for in the beginning. 

We still had a good trip and the location was ideal, but man, this hotel is not worth it for the money.",0,0,0

Not because it is the biggest and best hotel I have ever stayed at, but because the sheer number of things that you have to do. There is much construction going on right now, so I am expecting this place to get bigger and better as time goes on.  I also like that they have not fallen into the resort fees none sense that everyone else is doing.   I truly wish they had free wifi!  The hotel is really a high 4 rating, because of minor things that could be coming in the future, but I am comfortable giving it a 5.

Let me start off by saying that I did not get a chance to do everything that is in this place.  I really do not have the time or resources to splurge to that level!  If you are not a member, sign up for the FREE PROGRAM of total rewards, or something of that nature.  You get so many discounts just for being in the program, plus you have your own line waiting on you to check in.  You start off as a Gold member, but as you progress, you get more perks, of course.  The card is used at many hotels and casinos. 

I must have stayed in a King Go-Room because my room was awesome.  Nice lounge chair thingy in the room.  Ultra comfortable king bed with nice comforter on it.  The air condition works heavenly.  Nice sized television with dvd player and external stereo system.  Spacious.  Standing showing and detached tub.  Nicely designed sink.  Television in the bathroom, behind the mirror.  This room had everything you needed, except a microwave!  

Outside the room, you are going to have many types of alcohol and ways to gamble...being that it is Vegas, that is a given.  I did like that this hotel had some great main acts just an elevator ride away from your room, inside the establishment.  They even gave away many types of show tickets, via a DJ, at the pool!  The pool area is really nice with a huge swimming pool with waterfalls and a slide that was not in operation yet.

There is a quality buffet, that was kind of pricey, but with your total rewards card, you get a discount on that as well.  There was always a huge variety of items to choose from, but given that I am from New Orleans, no foods were spiced as if you were in New Orleans!  Take that aside from the food experience, some things were seasoned well enough to get a couple of smiles out of me.  The tell the chef what type of pasta you want option was cool, just like the build your omelet option for breakfast.  The dessert menu was pretty decently sized with two types of ice cream cones to go, as well as cotton candy to go.  Fondue pots and a build your own fresh crepe option was a nice touch.

It is called the Flamingo hotel because you actually do have flamingos and other birds on the property.  You can see them while dining at the buffet.  If you go outside, on your way to the pool even, you can see them a lot closer.  Huge fish and turtles are found throughout the waters with the many types of different birds and waterfalls.

I can go on and on about this hotel and the excellent set up, but I leave you with this, plenty of high quality shows, drinks, food options and fun in this hotel.  There is even a special place for your dog to do his business!  Check it out for yourself and see for yourself.",14,3,4

I went to several other casinos on the strip and in old Vegas off of Fremont street and this was the dirtiest one I have ever been too. 

The poker room would have been nice except for the tables seemed to be falling apart. The cup holders didn't stay attached when I picked up my drink so there was that to contend with. There is a $5.99 charge to use the ATM which is about standard. But what caught me off guard was the fact that I wanted to play in the tournament and not a cash game....and they wouldn't let me pay the tourney fee with my card. I was told I had to go and get cash to enter. So to me it was....pay $65.99 to get the money to play or just walk away. So I payed and played but they will not get my patronage ever again and if you're in Vegas I recommend you avoid this place. 

If you like craps, almost all tables I have been to from Vegas to New Orleans to San Diego, and this is the only casino that I have been in that plays double 2 and double 12s.  All others it's triple 12s. Ridiculous. I'd avoid this place like the plague",1,1,1

Flamingo was the only family friendly hotel (with a great location on the strip) that I could book so last minute and stay within my budget. Since it is an older hotel, I didn't want to take my chances and booked a GO room. It was only 16 dollars or so more (per night) and totally worth it. The GO rooms are the remodeled rooms and come with views. We had a view of the fountains\/habitat area which was really pretty. The room also came with a small fridge and coffee maker. The decor is really cute. The bed posts and pink walls were my favorite part. The rest of the hotel is just so so. Not the type of hotel I would want to spend time in outside my room. The courtyard area is cute though. Has a bunch of fountains, koi pond, and a flamingo habitat area (flamingos stink when its hot out though). Food wise it's somewhat limited and boring. I'd go to the surrounding hotels for eats. Location wise, its pretty great. Right across from Caesars and walking distance to Planet Hollywood, Cosmopolitan and a few other great spots. The pool is one of the best parts about this place. It's separated into two parts. One is a family pool for kids and the other is the Go pool which is 21 and over. Lots of trees so for those of us (like me) who burn easily, its the perfect spot to lounge. It starts off slow but turns into a full blown pool party after noon. Pretty fun and the pool itself is spacious enough to where it doesn't feel like a million people are bumping into you. My only major annoyance was the customer service. It's not a hotel I'd get excited about staying in again, but not bad for a last minute option.",1,0,1

The housekeeper finally showed up and said he couldnt remove the filth and needs to be painted over!!!

At the end if the night, I asked to change rooms the next day because they couldn't today and the agent said ""Try back between 11-1 tomorrow.""

No effort at all to help me and no one took this issue seriously.

Of course, the expenses that weekend were covered by work.

Our most recent friendcation was on our individual dimes and we decided to book a room at the Flamingo.  It's the perfect spot to cut lodging costs so you have more expendible income for booze and the blackjack tables.  We were given a ""junior suite"" (non-updated) that was massive and plenty of room for the 4 of us (we could have easily slept 8-10).  The pool was great, too.  Lots of people everywhere, friendly bartenders, and just enough sun to get a tan.  They could have more bathrooms, though.

The only bad part of the stay was the broken ice machine outside of our room.  We needed ice... to keep our drinks cold in the room, and the other ice machine was at least 1\/2 mile away down the hallway (oh yeah... you could drop 10lbs just walking from the front entrace to your room depending on what wing of the hotel you are staying in).

After driving through oppressing Holiday traffic, I arrived to find both the Valet and Self parking (unapologetically) full, leaving me to locate  parking off site (at another hotel), paying non-guest rates, not to mention  the inconvenience.

A couple of punk rockers on a whim decide to go to Vegas with very little money.  As far as the Strip Casinos were concerned the Flamingo was the best that we explored.

You can take the elevator to the top with no key, which allowed us to get cool views of the city.  There is a little courtyard area with flamingos, koi, turtles, ducks, and swans that we wasted some time in that was pretty neat.

We played some cheap slots, tipped our server $5 each and she brought us two strong drinks at a time every time she came by, which was awesome because at the other casinos that didn't even warrant servers coming back very often.

As far as playing blackjack goes, yeah the rules suck and you're being ripped off.  I played for awhile knowing I was going to lose my money but I played because unlike the other casinos (even the El Cortez which is where it's at for good blackjack) the dealers were friendly, helpful, and funny.  Everywhere else the dealers were dead eyed and barely spoke and you were playing your games in complete and utter silence.  Which was kinda creepy.

Decent enough stay, as I was in town for a conference.

Opt for the kiosks in the lobby for check-in, otherwise you'll be in line for a while.

While the lobby is a throwback to the Flamingo's glory days (shiny marble floors, lots of smoke, and some hustle and bustle), the hallways and rooms are tired. While my room offered some relative peace and quiet from the strip, it could use some updated furnishings, fresh paint, and attention to your standard wear-and-tear. Some areas of the room were worn out for some time, so much so that I'm not sure that they will be attended to in the near term.

The only other one I know of is at Mandalay and it's usually 2-3 times as much to stay there (on a good\/cheap day).  

While you won't run into basketball players or celebrities, it's a solid casino to stay at if you come on a budget and are looking for some solid pool-lounging time.  The rooms are clean, the service has always been efficient, and the location is convenient.  

The last time I stayed here, I kinda felt like I was in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.  The casino has that old school feel of 80's Vegas with the flamingo vomit carpet.  Hopefully, they've updated since or will be updating soon.

I suppose this is a sound business strategy:
1.  Be severely understaffed on personnel able to help customers withdraw money from a malfunctioning machine.   This saves money on payroll.

1) Rooms are equipped to handled all the latest in tech gadgetry, but most of it was unplugged!  So, do people actually use them (or do they not know how?)

(We're pretty techie, and it drove us nuts that we couldn't figure it out.)
2) Mini-fridge was UNDER a counter table - Had to bend over and squat to get anything in\/out of it.
3) Bathroom (see pic) - Clean, but again, once you start to use it . . . Nice glass sliding door, but gaps when closed, so no privacy.  TP holder forced you to reach behind and it was impossible to tear any paper so we ended up putting the roll on the sink counter.  There is also little space between the commode and the sink - forget sharing to get ready in the morning!

Pros- 
1. Great view
2. TV in the mirror in the restroom. BOSE    ceiling speaker had a great sound!
 
Disappointments- 
1. Checked into 1st room on 16th floor- Lobby Elevators. Went to our room; room was not cleaned. Beds, bathroom and room needed housekeeping. We had to go back downstairs (with luggage & bags) and waited in line, again. 
We were re-assigned our 2nd room on the 24th floor - Spa Elevator. 
Rooms looked fabulous, view is fabulous, bathroom was fabulously incredible; approx a 20"" built into the mirror color TV with ceiling BOSE speaker which sounded fabulous! Room had a standard flatscreen TV but the audio system was this DENON receiver, 2 speaker and a sun woofer, looked impressive.
2. DENON receiver- disappointingly it did not work. Red power light kept blinking. I unplugged unit to see it would reset but to no avail. My wife called Guest Service for extra towels help to get this unit working. They had indicated someone would come and assistant us. 
3. Room safe we were using, noticed on Sat morning indicator screen displayed 'low battery' Called and advised room service. 
4. Wife and I, finished watching Mariah Carey Concert at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace. Wife and I walked back to Flamingo. Arrived at our room put the key in and the red and yellow light lit up. We tried it again, again and one last time. From the hallway phone I called the front desk and they forward my call to security. I spoke to security named Mas (this isn't his real name). I explained my situation and gave him my room number. He asked me because my wife checked us is she there. I said she is standing at our door. He says (with a sarcastic tone), ""I asked you is she there!"" I said, ""she is there and is standing at our door"" He said ""sir...."" I cut his conversation off and told him I didn't need to have this confrontational conversation with you, right now. Can you send someone to get us into our room?"" He says, ""I'll send someone up""
15-20 minutes later, security lets us into our room. Security advised us to call front desk and have them send up new keys. We do just that as soon as we enter the room, my wife calls front desk and explains what just transpired. They indicated we'll have someone come up with your new keys. 
We change our clothes and wait, wait and wait some more. One hour and fifteen minutes later, a knock wakes us up.",3,0,0

I was excited before I arrived because it was my first time in Vegas.  However, this quickly faded.  My room was not what I expected in fact I have actually stayed at Holiday Inns that were better.

The furniture had ink writing\/drawings on it. The windows were very dirty, and 2 nights I had no hot water.  Not to mention WIFI is charged, and there the room only has basic cable.  Once again Holiday Inn's offer free WIFI and HBO.  The elevators are horrible graffiti and missing wall mounts.  They writing and scratches all over it...reminded me of the mall elevators.

Most of the staff at the check in counter are very friendly but the rest of the staff not so much.  I called to get my hot water fixed and it took 25 mins for someone to come to the room.  Then the maint. guy step with his dirty boots all over the floor mat.  The hotel did not offer any comp. for the bad service.

The best thing about this hotel is the outside area...its beautiful with the water falls, ducks, birds, and fish.

This one was better but not by much. Floor had white spots on it., which if mopped I'm sure would come up. Shower has mold. Wallpaper is ripped and pealing.

Ice machine stayed broken four days after reporting it. Elevators strange and irregular (to the point that I expected to get stuck at any time). Noisy. Pizza from the pizza place downstairs had a Bisquik crust and was cold and flavorless--including CANNED mushrooms. Maybe there's something better in the ""food court,"" but that's closed for ""sewer repairs.""  Because of construction, it took a half hour to find the parking ramp in the first place. Pro tip: the ""Flamingo Hilton"" is a different hotel--one that actually has checkin-parking in front--unlike the Flamingo.

By accurate measurement, it was 0.4 mile walking from the parking ramp to my room. 

I've stayed at Caesar's Palace and it really IS a palace compared to the Flamingo.

Final indignity: took a half hour to CHECK OUT.  The 700 year old clerk (who was on oxygen, probably so customers would feel sorry for her and not spring on her like a panther when she says something sarcastic) told me ""you could review your bill and check out on the room TV.""  Well, not if I wanted a receipt.  Also, the ""express checkout kiosk"" suckered me out of line and didn't work, and ten more people were in line ahead of me when I returned.

Second pro tip:  ALWAYS do valet parking.  There's no charge--just a tip.  It's worth five bucks to not walk through the 110 degree (no, that isn't a typo) ramp.  I've stayed at four places on the strip and the Flamingo is the worst so far.

We had heard decent things about Flamingo so decided to try it. We come to Vegas a few times a year and have stayed at TI, Mirage, Paris, New York New York, Monte Carlo, Golden Nugget and Downtown Grand. I paid more online to get the ""Strip View"" and the rooms looked updated and remodeled in pics. 

 First thing we rolled into valet and nobody to be found. Went and parked in garage. The walk from garage along outside is littered with trash and cigarette butts. We did self checkin and got to our room at 2am. The elevators are dirty and the walk to our room is long. Doesnt even have a fridge or coffee pot which i heard is an extra charge after the fact. We could find two outlets to charge 4 phones that weren't in the bathroom.  Room is run down with furniture delaminating and falling apart. Our strip view was an alley between hotels that you could look to right to see Hi Roller or left to see Mirage hotel sign if you press your face against the filthy windows. Not a strip view.  To top it off we got to listen to nightclub blaring music until 4am every night from the alley. We got 3 towels in our double queen room. Requested 4 and next day only got 3 again. The vent doesnt work in shower so when one of 4 of us showered it fogged the mirror so bad nobody could use it and there was 4 of us. Hot water in sink takes about 5 minutes to reach the room. The beach club pool which is for families is small , has no pool service and all water slides talked about are in adults only pool. Interaction with employees was mediocre. Nobody seemed to care.

The hotel is in a prime spot on the strip and this will always appeal to people no matter what the price or condition of the resort and there's nothing wrong with that. We didn't use the pool but it looked nice and was always full. The poker room was great (2-4 limit) and I was always able to get a seat with just a few minutes wait. Dealers were out- standing and a pleasure to interact with at all times! Gaming in general was good and won some money on slots (maybe I can but a dinner our two). Centered in a prime location it's easy to get to other locations by walking to see what else might be available for you to explore. Our room was very nice on the 24th floor right across from Caesars Palace and we could see the fountains at The Bellagio go off. This was one of our better views we've had in Vegas. The room was clean and on the newer side. The bathroom was large and clean, overall the room was a pleasure to stay in. Now a bit on the down side with no stretching the truth. The hotel it's dated and does not appear that they are trying to put any serious money into it. The elevators are a serious...serious...serious joke (see photo). Buttons missing, buttons that as you left the ground floor they would go blank and would have to be pushed multiple times to reach your floor. I stepped on one elevator (working) ALL the lights were out...totally black inside...got off right away! Check in, WOW if I live to be a hundred I'll never see anything like that line again. Talking to some employees all they comments were ""...it's very embarrassing that they done have staff to cover stuff like this..."". All in all it was a ok stay.

The weather, was great. 100+ every day. I love the heat the hubby not so much. We were not able to check in until 4 pm. So we went to another hotel for the night. The Best Western down the strip was able to accommodate us immediately. And for the same price.  The next day we finally checked in at the Flamingo and went to our room. It was a king bed. There was a great view of the pool from the tenth floor. I also liked that they did not have carpeting. The room seemed to be renovated recently.  Although, my husband thought the lamps were from the 60's. Lol. We did not spend a lot of time in room except to shower and sleep. There were a few things that needed attention though. 

The bathtub faucet continually ran. Not dripped but ran. We put a towel in the tub so we did not hear the constant drops.  The wallpaper above the window was peeling in the corner. The lightbulb in the bathroom was not working. I couldn't figure out why it was so dark. Until the second day. The drain in the sink was very slow going down. My biggest concern was the outlet next to the bed appeared to have a prong broke off in it. I did inform the clerk when I was checking out. I told him it may be a fire hazard. He did note that in the checkout notes. But nothing else. 

When you stay here, at least in our room, there is no refrigerator there is no microwave   You need to pay for the shuttle to and from the airport, about $7 a person. That is about the same as a cab. 

It is a beautiful hotel.the only problem with walking the casino or going sightseeing is the people who stop you constantly to purchase shows and stuff. It gets really pushy at times. If I wanted tickets I would get the or ask how to get them. It's not just in the casinos or hotels it's everywhere. The one concierge was extremely helpful  was named Ron. The self check in kept telling us to see the clerks. He was able to explain what we needed. 

You can also check your luggage before check in if you are early. Then , they will deliver it to your room when you get there. The people working the luggage check in were great. Very helpful. Gave recommendations for sites and where to eat. 

Would I stay there again? Probably, if I went with my brothers who are high rollers. They get comps and upgrades all the time. This was our first time. My daughter gave us a tip, to get the three day bus pass. Unlimited ridding. Use the phone App. You will need to update every day the app.

The Cons: The Hotel is worn down, rooms have been upgraded, but poorly.  The floors are the plastic wood and the TV's are small 32' flat screens.   The carpet in the hallways are so old they are buckling up.  Yes, in Vegas, the rooms are mainly for sleeping, but a decent room always makes the stay all that much nicer.  The air is stale and rooms have low ceilings which I can touch and I am only 5'3"".   We used to stay here regularly in the mid to late 90's, but the Hotel has definitely gone down.  Sunday night the electricity went completely out in the north wing -all 28 floors!  The elevators worked, but no water on the upper floors.  Electricity was out for about 3-4 hours, but was restored by 11:00pm.  
The Pros:  The Lobby is still presentable and their pools are still nice. Lots of plants, birds, waterfalls, picture spots.   Self-check in is a plus.   Carlos and Charlies is an ok close place for drinks and decent meal.   Margaritaville is conveniently located for a nearby drink hangout.  Conveniently located in the middle of the strip.

Third complain was the dam elevators ! We stayed on the 17th floor, as we were leaving 2 out of the 6 elevators were working !!!!

While the rest of the Strip resorts were priced at $99+ per night (except the God-forsaken ""Quad"" next door), the Flamingo offered a standard, partly remodeled and generally clean room for $35\/night. It was perfect for my trip with friends. If I were out to impress someone; if I were on a romantic get-away; or if I were a hotel inspector, I'd upgrade or choose another property.

Here are the pluses and minuses.  If all you need is a comfortable room, a prime location, and a great price, definitely consider the Flamingo.

PLUSES
--Spacious room. Newly redone with faux hardwood floors. 
--I requested a room away from Quad construction, near an elevator. My room faced Bally's (perfect) and was 10 steps from the lifts.
--Friendly housekeeper saw me step out of my room at 11am and asked if I enjoy beer. Of course I do. She pointed down the hall toward a cooler full of Bud Light that another guest left upon departure. After she declined my marriage proposal, I flipped her a five and drank some breakfast. 
--Comfortable bed, pillows and linen.
--Quiet. I didn't hear any room-to-room noise. My room was directly next to the door housekeepers use to access the back of house. These rooms are infamous for being noisy as employees bang carts and vacuums and slam doors. Not at Flamingo. I heard no staff noise whatsoever.
--Outstanding location for Strip activities and easy access to downtown buses.

MINUSES
--Mold visible along tub grout.
--Air duct cover screwed on haphazardly.
--Dim bathroom lighting (no bueno for the ladies)
--No fridge.
--No blanket on bed--only a couple of sheets and a VERY creepy pink\/white\/black fake fur throw. 
--My room was ready when I arrived at 8am, but Flamingo charges $30 to check in before noon; $15 to check in before 4. If the room is ready, early check-in fees are nothing more than gouging. This was my least favorite part of the experience.
--I experienced no line upon arriving at 8am. However, I saw very, very, very long check-in lines during the evening hours. The front desk is clearly understaffed for a property of this size. Self check-in kiosks are available. Consider using them.
--Debris--a dry cleaning tag, a small pile of white stuff that looked like drywall--remained in the hall way on my floor the entire length of my stay.  I saw a room service tray discarded by another guest sitting in the hall for at least two days. Considering that, as stated above, my room was directly next to the door every member of the housekeeping team uses to access my floor, the fact that these items remained in place is....telling.

We had never been to Las Vegas before, but we chose to stay at the Flamingo because of its central location on the strip.  We even created a room block there to accommodate our 25 guests.  Most of our guests ended up right in the same hallway as us!  I think everyone would have if it hadn't been for people arriving different days, and it being the busy holiday time.  

Even though it was xmas week we were able to stay for 50 bucks a night for six nights.  Rates went up to 150 on Friday night because it was the weekend before new years.  I think for $50 per night and a little more on one day this was the perfect hotel for us.  We got the cheapest room you could get, but we still had a pretty good strip view.  We could see the Bellagio Fountains.  The room wasn't too fabulous, but it was just fine for us.  If we did it again we would probaby get a go room.  One of our friends had a Go Room and for not too much more the room is quite a bit nicer.  No, these rooms are not what you will find in the fancier hotels, but for a young couple staying there for a whole week it was just great.  Room service tasted pretty good too!

The casino was fun, and we LOVED Margaritaville.  We ate there three times and spent a decent amount of time, and money, in that casino.  

The best part of the Flamingo is the location on the strip.  You really can't beat it!  We took turns walking south one day and then north the other day and really got to see all of the neat places\/hotels that we wanted to see.  WHEN we go back to Vegas we will definitely stay at the Flamingo again!!!  : )",0,0,0

Within walking distance of the Venetian, where we could visit many of the exhibitors, and easily catch a shuttle to the Convention Center, the Flamingo Hotel turned out to be the SECOND MOST DISGUSTING PLACE in which we have ever stayed. Rooms at this hovel (not a typo) range from 35.00 in the low season to 289.00 for rip off season. They have a lot of nerve.Arriving at midnight after a LONG ASS day of flying due to a snow storm in our layover city, Chicago, all we wanted was a quick bite and a comfy bed, on which to rest our pretty heads. Sadly, the line to check in, had at least 20 people in front of us. We waited patiently, knowing that would happen very soon. We checked in, then walked through the smoky filled casino to the FOOD COURT to grab a bite.
We waited on line to order a burger and salad, at Johnny Rocket's. seconds, I finally go to order my long awaited tuna salad, at 12:00 midnight and 3 seconds. ""We don't serve tuna after midnight"". I perused the menu, and SETTLED on a turkey burger. ""We don't serve turkey burgers after midnight"", said the fellow at the cash register.
""Are you kidding me?"", I asked. He wasn't.""We serve burgers or eggs"", the young man told me.
Dan ordered his burger and I sauntered over to the other seemingly healthy food option, a Chinese Chicken Salad from L.A. salad and wraps.
Suffice it to say, the CHICKEN that was on top of this lettuce, green onion, fried chinese noodle mix, was not EXACTLY chicken. It was other worldly. I think maybe it was chicken roll or something else fashioned into a flat cutlet type thing.
We guzzled the food, and couldn't wait to get upstairs, proving that when I'm hungry I will eat anything.
Arrving on the 8th floor, it was clear that they place was a well worn. The halls weren't all that clean. I take that back. They were gross. There were rips in the carpet, along with gum smooshed into it. The doors were all dirty too. I chalked it up to old age, and was a little forgiving, but still not happy.
The room came with a view (this was NOT it), and all the loud sounds that come, an entire city block of construction. Right outside my window! The room, with its ancient furniture, wasn't HORRIBLE.
The roach crawling on the wall, on the other hand was.The bathroom was replete with toothpaste. Oh, not toothpaste to use with my toothbrush.
This toothpaste, was in the air conditioning grates....Perhaps the maid missed it...All five days, that we stayed there.
She also missed the q-tip that was stuck in between the missing tiles. Well, they weren't missing, they were just behind the toilet. She did miss the giant hair that was stuck to the ceiling also.
None of this was nearly as nauseating as the 2 inches of dust, that was living in the bathroom lighting fixtures. Let's just say the place is a little run down. Understatement.
The toilet was also DISGUSTING. ALL FIVE DAYS.
After checking for bedbugs, assuming that the housekeeping staff, would make sure that the room was really clean the next day, we HAD TO GO TO sleep. It was already after 1:30AM, and I was in no mindset, to call to bitch and moan. Did I just say that? We had to be up and out by 8:00AM, and I needed some rest.
I woke up with a stiff neck from using pillows that ranged from 6-8 inches high. Right before we left in the morning, I called housekeeping and asked for one, only one, DECENT pillow, explaining that these were all too rubbery and hard and I couldn't afford to work CES with a neck ache. She said, ""Sure thing. No problem.""
Later that night ( it was actually the next morning at around 1:30), we arrived back to the room after a LONG day of press events and parties, ready for sleep. The beds had been made, the garbage disposed of, towel folded, and sink cleaned. The toothpaste, dust, broken tiles and q-tip all remained untouched. Doesn't the housekeeping staff get trained in CLEANING?In addition, as far as I could tell, there was no pillow replacement. They all ranged from 6-8 inches high, and impossible for me to use. I slept without one.The next morning, with another crick in my neck, I called to ask about the pillows. This time the answer was, ""Those are the ONLY pillows that we have. They are all the same. The housekeeper brought you a new one"". I scratched my head. We spied these two pillows on the floor....yes I said, ""on the floor"", in front of another guest's room. They were there for at least 8 hours. Clearly I am not the only one, that doesn't like sleeping on HARD RUBBER. But I digress.",3,1,0

Since I test a\/c units everyday my guess is it was 60 degrees in the whole building. When at the ProLabs Inspectors conference and Picking up some CEs at a Plumbing class. I heard something dripping, looked over to see water running down a wall in the Reno room near an electrical outlet. The elevators gave every rider and I, the shared concern and worry that we might not make it out alive. There were noises of rattling and unusual elevator behavior. Looked up to see the ceiling of the elevator vibrating back and forth. A lot of this place needs some serious upgrades. While heading to our room we were met with high sale pushy vendors trying to sell time shares. While gambling one night was met with another dubious caractor who asured me, he could help me make thousands at the crap table. Yeh right dude. The remodeling of another building across the way started early and woke us up at 6:am. The last morning the fire alarm went off somewhere at 5:30am. When we called the operator she didn't have a clue then checked with security who told here it was a test..........for an hour? Finally I check my bill on the peace of CR$P TV in our room to find out they over charged me. They corrected my bill. All and All the convention was great, I learned a great deal and appreciate ProLabs sponsorship. Perhaps they should find a new location next time. We had some great meals at the big mall down the street one of the best was at Buddy Vs.

Gave this hotel 2 stars... Let me tell you why:
- Elevators sucked. One was down the entire time. Another one was possessed. It kept on opening and closing and then at times, the floor button lights disappeared so if you are not paying attention, you will miss your floor.
- Rooms: not bad.
- Bathroom: in order to be on the same floor with my friend, I got a handicapped room. First night, I showered and enjoyed the hand held shower but when I got out, half the bathroom floor was wet! I ended up having to turn on and off the water during my shower bc if I left it on, the water will spray right into the other side of the bathroom.
- Housekeepers: awesome.
- Front desk: not really welcoming... I needed packing tape and searched all of the hotel shops but could not find any so I decided to call the front desk. They didn't even try to find any for me. My husband works at a hotel in Waikiki and he said their hotel will try to accommodate their guest's request.
- Habitat wing: sucks a$$! Change, stretch or repair your carpets!!!! Wth! I tripped I don't know how many times! Room was so far from elevators. It was ridiculous! AND THE MUSIC BLASTS TILL 4 AM! Really?!!!
We came for a conference, so at 8:30am, listening to speakers was very hard to keep awake! Walls are paper thin. For some reason, I had a connecting door in my room! I could hear everything! Omg!
Will not ever stay here again!

Before you make your reservation, please note that the Flamingo hotel is very old and unkempt.  It is very dirty, the elevators are broken and unsafe (they will tell you that they are in the process of being repaired).  There is no safety switch on them and they will close on you; it hurts!   

The hotel staff provides an extremely low level of customer service and they have an excuse for everything.  ""Busy weekend"",""Undergoing repairs."" or ""Sorry I have not heard anyone else say that there was a problem with that before.""  A great example....Guests on the 8th floor were locked out their room 3 times in two days - with an hour wait for security to come up and get us in each time.  I spoke to the front desk and they claim management had no idea.  Well, house keeping was locked out of the 8th floor, security was locked out of the 8th floor and your guests were locked out of the 8th floor.  How did you not hear?  So many excuses!  

Want something to eat or drink at the pool?  Well, you'll have to go to the snack bar because there are no servers to take care of you at the pool.  At any given time you'll stand for 30-60 minutes at the snack bar for food and drink.  And yes, you have to stand in two lines.

But his time round I was on a work sponsored trip for a conference that was being held at the Flamingo and so I thought it made more sense to stay at the conference location regardless of my hesitation..... Big mistake!! 

Arriving on Sunday at 5pm I proceeded to wait in the check in line for 45 minutes before finally making it to the front of the line and then being told that I had booked a room that had not been updated and was, in the receptionists words, 'very old, very outdated and a little smelly' but they could move me to the updated GO rooms for no additional charge - I agreed and grabbed my keys.  

The elevator trip up to the room was interesting to say the least (forget the rooms flamingo! Maybe it's time to update the elevators) and a couple of times I thought I may end up spending my night in the elevator trapped!! Unfortunately this experience occurred everytime I got in the elevator and some times it was even more 'exciting' as I had to dodge the vomit or other miscellaneous liquid on the floor.

However my biggest concerns while staying were the fact that (1) upon checking in you sign away all of the hotels liability for anything that goes missing from your room (what?!?!?!) or any damage or theft to your vehicle if parked in their parking structure via valet or self park (double say what?!?!?!?) during your stay (2) the hotels wifi digital security certificate had expired and I therefore couldn't connect my work computer to the wifi the entire time I stayed and (3) there is room service only between the hours of 6am and 1pm and the menu is limited to say the least...

3 When we finally arrived in our room 21-107 it was beyond dirty!!!! When I pulled the sheets back to double check I was shocked to find a pubic hair and a long black hair. There we're splatters on the restroom mirrior from someone brushing their teeth or washing their hands. The tray where the coffee was had a layer of coffee on it!! There we're also empty toilettre boxes on the vanity area.

When I asked her to explain, she gave me attitude.

Finally, things were going well. Then all of a sudden at 1am (the morning before check out) one of our rooms were locked and we couldn't get back in. I called once and then said a security guard would show up to unlock the doors. When he never came, I called again and I was informed that I had to come to the front desk to solve the problem. So at 1am, I came to the front desk to figure out why we couldn't get into one of our rooms, and the manager gave me attitude and just said someone made a long distance call. I had no idea what that meant or why he mentioned it. I just wanted to know why my group couldn't get into their room and get some sleep. Finally, he explained that when someone makes long distance calls, you get charged but because the card hadn't been authorized, they locked us out. After he explained so rudely, he then said someone needs to pay $250 to open the room. After I paid, the manager gave us new keys and checked that they worked. I walked back to room and what do you know, the keys don't work. It's now 2am, and I have to call again to get the room unlocked. By 2:40am, we finally got the room unlocked.

Pros: It was cheap and the room was clean... at first. 

Cons: When I slept in past noon the first day -- in part because it took more than an hour to find a parking spot since there is little to no parking, not even valet parking, at the hotel itself -- the room did not get serviced. I even called housekeeping to tell them when I was leaving since I had the ""do not disturb"" note on past noon, but when I came back in the evening the room had not been serviced.

When I called the front desk, I was told that putting up the ""do not disturb"" sign is the same as ""declining service,"" and that once service was ""declined"" there is no guarantee you will ever get it. 

Declining service pretty much describes this place. Also, the patio at night -- don't look around too closely. It's crawling with some of the most amazing insect life you'll ever see. 

Also, booked a strip view room. I was 'upgraded' to a room with a view of... I dunno... it looked like Lebanon, but I was told it's a construction zone. When I told them that's not what I'd call an upgrade, they told me the room is slightly bigger, therefore it's an upgrade, and don't ask them to do anything else about it.

A few days ago I had reservations for a show (Jeff Civilco) at the ""cabaret"" inside the Flamingo Hotel Casino. Went to the box office (will call) to pick-up the tix and was told the show was cancelled for the rest of the year due to an injury. Having driven quite a distance to see the show, I was disappointed. I asked the box office employee about possible things the Flamingo could offer to help resolve the situation. She had to ask her manager.

Enter box office manager Sherice. She immediately understood the problem and, with a smile, gave me some options. She was so kind and helpful, I was tempted to accept anything she offered. But, my schedule did not permit me to return later that evening for a different show. I explained. True to form, Sherice completely understood and offered other options. Of these, there was one that worked. Although still an inconvenience, I was impressed with Sherice's generous efforts.

This is an example of how one employee, Sherice, was able to change a customer's experience from bad to good. And, along with the experience, an overall appreciation for the Flamingo was turned from negative to positive.

I won't go back even if it is free.  If they demolish it, I want to be the trigger man on the dynamite and I'll pay big bucks to make it happen.

The elevators are a death trap. We had one drop about a foot while loading.  You talk about a scare! Doors wouldn't close over and over, more than half were not working at all, and the staff knew.  We were even told to avoid a certain bank of elevators but the entire hotel is full of dangerous, dirty, old elevators.  I heard stories of people being trapped while we were there.

While walking (sober) I nearly tripped and fell because the floor is uneven and carpet is loose and torn in various areas everywhere. They have taped some parts while others they did not even bother to patch so you can see concrete.

Room 1 was decent but the bathroom was ridiculously small and dirty.  I don't think we had shampoo and our A\/C went out.  I was sweating. The fan wasn't moving air and it certainly wasn't cold.

We advised them of the problem but the girl at the desk mentioned it was booked completely.  I asked to speak with a manager because we'd be leaving if that was the case. I'm not sleeping in a sweatbox.    Our second room was issued and we were pleased that you could actually have more than one person in the bathroom at a time....but...we think someone committed suicide in the room...and recently.  I wish I could ask law enforcement and find out for sure, or even taken a swab to have an analysis done.  Seriously folks.  A giant area of blood spray on the wall above the door connecting to the room next door.  You could see that the other walls were recently cleaned but apparently they forgot this section.   We were not sure we wanted to deal with it but we informed the management, showed pics, and they gave us some food credit so they could clean up.  We were out of the room for over two hours, came back, and nothing had been done.   I called and they were shocked.   I told them we wanted a new room, didn't care what they needed to do, didn't care if it was another total rewards property, I was not going to look at that mess and frankly I was a little creeped out.  They told me they didn't have a room, I sent my wife down to talk face to face.  Minutes later housekeeping showed up asking us if we vomited, ""You have Bio?"" was the exact phase she used..   She thought we had thrown up and was checking or coming to clean...I'm not sure because she had no supplies.   We showed her, she freaked out, took photos to send to her manager and then my wife text me to tell  to meet her at a new room. Room number 3.

It was the last room on the entire floor and I hate that.  When we opened the door it was cold, had a decent bathroom size, and was large....but... That was it.  We now had a room styled in the 90's, the bathtub shower was disgusting. They haven't seen a commercial for CLR apparently and don't know what mildew is.  I think the TV was a 19"" tube. The channels had static, and the cabinet looked like it was rescued from hurricane Katrina based on the water stains.  Our beds were not queens but doubles.  I almost fell out many times, could feel springs in my back, and I'm sore like none other.  I would have slept on the floor but it was filthy and stained, like the entire hotels carpet.

In closing, visit the casino, Margaritaville, maybe even the pool, sure, but do not take an elevator, do not ask for a room, and I wouldn't waste time at the buffet either.   If you're rich and stupid, go enjoy the $16 pool drinks that are so sweet you can barely drink them.",0,0,0

No free wifi, the pool closes super early, and the sheets had stains in various parts of the bed, there was this disgusting fur like throw over the end of the bed that looked infested with dust and the towels in the restroom also had stains.

The garden with the animals is good. Pools are ok. A lot of people but it is not fault of the hotel. The staff is friendly and kind. 

I give 2 stars to this hotel because our room smelt to tobacco smoke every time. We hate this smell and sometime it was unbearable. The housekeeper tried to fight against the smell, but nothing changed (it is not his fault. He was very kind). Also, our room was connected with another room by a door. With which, if somebody wants to do a party you are in, even if you don't want. The bathroom was old and it needs to be upgraded. And the lifts too. 

In addition, you have to pay for wifi 15$ dollars per day!!! For us this point was important because we are from Spain and we want\/need to be in contact. This was very annoying for us above all because you don't pay in other hotels. Even if you are not a guess.",0,0,0

First let me say it only cost about $400 to stay there for three nights. Very affordable. I only stay at total rewards casinos because I like my points. We thought staying at the classic flamingo sounded cool. There was mixed reviews online due to renovations. We ended up with a ""partial renovated"" room according to the desk. Only thing bad about the room was the bathroom. Very small. Can't fit two people in. Shower leaked water all night. Kinda annoying sound. Oh well. Casino was fine. Very casual atmosphere not ritzy so that was nice. Center of the strip which is perfect. The pool was awesome but it was jam packed with people. We rented a daybed so we didn't have to lay towels on the ground and get stepped on. So worth the money. Biggest downside of the whole stay was the elevators. Horrible conditions. Seems like only two worked at a time. Got stuck in one once. Very outdated. I'm very surprised their local code enforcement doesn't make them fix those. Where I'm from the elevator have to be inspected and ate very strict. Sometimes it was 20 minutes to get up to our floor. Overall stay was fine. It's very affordable strip hotel. It's due for more renovations. I'm sure they'll keep the improvements coming.",0,0,0

Last week was my vacation\/wedding weekend and we've stayed at the flamingo twice already in the past with no problems. This was also about 6 years ago. I'm not sure if they've switched owners or new management but it was night and day from our past stays. We chose this hotel because of the location and our own personal reviews and boy, were we wrong. The moment we got there was just a hassle. From older woman coming out of every corner asking us if we want a vacation deal to just straight harassment. It got old staying there for two days and ALWAYS getting harassed. The check out line was a joke. The line took at least an hour just to check in and if you didn't want to deal with it they had check in kiosks. We were told our room was ready and we can head on up. We got a ""new"" upgraded room and the last two times just got the regular cheaper rooms. When we went up we realized that yes, it's newly ""updated"" but the room couldn't be anymore smaller. It's 10X smaller than our two queen bed rooms we've gotten each time before but this was more expensive! We then discovered a feminine hygiene product (maxi pad) in the closet so it wasn't cleaned. That wasn't the worse part, we didn't have any electricity in half of our room and the other half buzzed and flickered. So we called the front desk to let them know the problem and they said someone would be up. No one ever showed PLUS no one brought us up our luggage. So we call one more time and they told us we needed to personally come down to resolve the matter. We waited an hour to talk to someone who wasn't helpful at all. Said she had no upgrades (but they did, we checked online) and they gave us the same exact room just on a different floor. Then after 3-4 hours of dealing with this we finally go down to the pool area who have these security guards taking their jobs way too seriously who made me dump out all my contents of my purse. We get there spend $42 on a drink, finally find a seat and they close the pool!! At 6pm. We immediately had to leave. No warning or anything going into the pool from any security guard or employee. We wasted our whole day trying to get help from anyone from this hotel and received nothing. Then during check out we got stuck on the 27th floor for 20 minutes because the elevators weren't working. And the stairs are on the OUTSIDE of the building. Never EVER staying here again and for anyone who does please be aware or their lack of hospitality.",1,0,1

It's one of the cheaper options on The Strip and it shows. Sure the rooms are renovated but the lobby and hallways leave a lot to be desired. And although the room was renovated, it still looked like it could use a lot of work! The lamp shade was dented, there was nail polish stains on the bedside table and the bathroom was just disgusting. Needed a new paint job and a serious deep cleaning to get the dust off the vents. Ew. 

We had two rooms and requested to get them adjoining. They were unable to do this and would not even upgrade us to a suite so we all could be together. Also, out of the 3 days we were there the maids only touched our room once. Our one rooms air conditioning did not work either. In Vegas, that's a serious problem. Unfortunately, customer service isn't a huge priority for the staff. 

The thing that got me the most however was that there is ZERO cell phone reception in your room. Not even your LTE or whatever you have on your phone. None of it works. They tell you if you pay for the wifi it'll be reimbursed after you check out. Uhhh didn't want to fight that battle later so didn't bother with that. 

My recommendation: you're in Vegas. Splurge for a nice room at the MGM!

To start, I was on a non-smoking floor and the stench of smoke was so strong throughout that I could barely open my eyes.

I decided to shower as I'd spent a long day I the desert--there was no water pressure, I couldn't get the water hot and just as I wet my body, I looked over at the wall to find five long black hairs (not mine) stuck to it. Yuck. I washed my hair in the sink instead.

I called guest services to report the fact that the bathroom hadn't been cleaned; they were very nonplussed and didn't even offer to switch my room. I was charged a ""resort fee,"" which was not mentioned in the original booking, even though I didn't use any amenities.

Once we got down there, the pool was pretty nice. They must have a problem with people sneaking in from imperial palace or something because you have to pass through airport security to get in here. You have to wear a wristband that will mess with your tan. Boo! 

Anyway, on to the lounge chairs. I lay my towel down, sit, and my ass immediately hits the ground. Looks like the ""Buffet of Buffets"" special has taken its toll as all the lounge chairs are stretched out beyond belief. Deemed too uncomfortable to lay in for an extended period of time, we make our way over to the bar. Slurpee-shushee frozen concoctions, $13 for a little one and $18 for a 32 ouncer. Our bartender was a doll and let us split a big pina colada, added a lot of extra rum and gave us 2 cups to divvy them up, while complimenting us ""beyoootiful ladies"" lol! He was adorable, but the rest of the pool..the Mirage beats you.

We stayed in the upgraded ""Go"" room and it was pretty nice- it even came with a coffee maker and empty mini fridge, though the maid never replenished our coffee supply. Waah. The tv in the bathroom mirror did not work but they called us at 8am the next morning to send a tech to fix it. Um, I'll pass! The ipod stereo requires some kind of special cable that you can check out from the front desk, so make sure you ask for it upon check in. The aux cable we use in the car did not work, and we ended up using our own ipod dock the whole trip. The reading lights did not work and half the light bulbs above the beds were burnt out. But the room did not stink and the flatscreen TV was big. 

It seems as though a lot of seniors frequent this hotel, which means there has to be some really good deals lurking about. I tried a little slot machine action, and nope, it's not loose slots. Maybe the buffet? The regular price for dinner was about $23, no senior special unless you buy that $35 mega buffet pass. The burger place offers a 2.99 burger and fries special from midnight-6am...but the oldies are in bed by then. I never found out what the secret was until I got home. Yes, I did join the Total Rewards slot club and stuck that card in the machine while I pumped about $50 in casino donations through it. When I got home, I entered my total rewards number into the website and checked future room rates. Wow! Up to 3 nights COMPED midweek at Flamingo, Bally's, Rio, or imperial palace (ew) for a low roller like me? Some weekend rates at $20\/ night?

I booked this, unknown,  from Hotiwre, wanting  ""Central Strip"" to be near the Mirage for the Love show, while saving most of the $$ for what was most improtant. (See StripSteak review!)

We ended up getting this place for $100\/ night in February. The location can't be beat. Right across from Ceaser's, nestled between Paris and the Venetian. Even has its own monorail stop. The location itself makes it a great value at that price, but we were pleasantly suprised that we dug the vibe as well. 

It's got that retro, kitsch, Old-School Vegas feel without being incredibly dated or run-down. It's certainly not as plush or new as some of its neighbors, but there's nothing much to complain about. 

We liked the all the pink and lights, the ""wildlife park"" of birds and actual flamingos in center of the space. Early February, we couldn't take advantage of the sprawling pool and jacuzzi grounds, but we walked around and got a sense of how dope it is. They have slides and stuff! The pool area is retro but banging. Near the pool is also a shrine to the original owner of the casino, Mr. Bugsy Seagull himself, replete with history-lesson on the man.  

For newbie- gamblers, we appreciated the lower-key feel of the game floor. We were able to integrate ourselves into a Roulette game and learn as we went. At Caeser's, the tables were too intimidating for that with all the hustle and bustle and those serious faces. Not to mention, the Flamingo had lower minimum bets! 

I had read about the remodeled Pink rooms and tried to request one, but since I went through Hotwire, I don't think I was really eligible. However, when we checked in we were told that we received a complimentary upgrade to a ""Junior Suite"". The room was NOT the remodeled pink kind, but it was huge, a separate bedroom for sleeping, and then a living room with a couch, tv, desk, closet,  and huge window with a moderately decent view. The best thing about this kinda ""suite"" is that the windows aren't in the bedroom, so you can really sleep your little heart out without any light coming in. The decor was nothing special, mostly beige, but it didn't bother me any. 

DInner next door at Paris. Seasonal displays at across the street at Bellagio. Shopping at Ceasers Forum and then at Venetian Mall for good measure. Dollar beers at whats-its-scum a few buildings over. Perfect location and 100% Vegas, as this was  *THE* *FIRST *HOTEL* on the strip.",3,1,2

It is not loaded with glitz and glitter like some of the newer Strip hotels, but it's more than worth the cheap price you'll probably get.

Good:  POOL (w\/ Craps and BJ poolside), Sports book (comfy chairs and it's right in the main floor not separate), Margaritaville (corny, but good food).  Also, you can check in at the airport.  While I gambled poolside, my wife was able to snag drinks by just standing next to me for a few minutes.

Just OK:  the standard room.  We didn't get a Go room, but we did have a Strip view and the huge windows are cool for dancing naked in front of (I don't THINK you can see from outside..?)  The buffet was OK, not great.

I thought the casino floor was pretty damn big.  We played mostly outside by the pool, but inside we also played near the front where the ladies deal blackjack.  Drinks came quick and full-size beers not just little glasses.

Bad:  Someone ripped off my shorts (with phone) from under my chair at the pool.  Luckily I had my wallet and cash on me.  Security did the report, but sadly, that 2-year verizon POS is gone forever.  Oh well...",1,0,2

The hotel is huge and the check in line takes forever.  It took me an hour.  When my boss checked in in the evening, it took her an hour too! My room was very clean and had some cute pink curtains and a pink throw.  The room and bathroom were very spacious.  The thing I liked the most was the floor- it was a dark brown and foamy which is perfect after walking around all day in heels! 

I liked all the pink touches and the flamingos in this hotel! Very cute. 

I've heard good things about the pool but I didn't have time to check it out.  It's got a great location in the middle of the strip and the monorail is a really short convenient walk away. 

Let me put it this way: Flamingo is no 5-star hotel but for it's price and 3-star status and compared to other hotels of its caliber, I think it's great and I would totally stay here again!",5,1,1

Flamingo in my opinion has been the best bang-for-your-buck. I booked the lowest priced room, but was able to upgrade to the GO rooms  (they have the big white cushion headboards). I thought the room was great! My room was on the 22nd floor, w\/ a view of the Bellagio Fountains. The room was clean, flat screen TV, stereo system, couch, TV built into the bathroom mirror, shower and tub. Shower had 2 mid-level jets too!

What I liked:

- Centrally located on the Strip, easy to get places. 
- Room had an EMPTY mini fridge. (High-end hotels have triggers that charge you if you remove anything from them, low-end hotels have nothing and I end up bringing a cooler and refilling w\/ ice. Having this allowed me to stock it with my own beers and drinks! 
- Flat-screen (amazingly, some places still don't have these) 
- TV built into the mirror in bathroom
- Stereo w\/ Sub. Great for getting ready and pre-gaming
- Remote Drapes
- Express Check-out from your TV

Things I didn't like:

- They note an iPod docking station, but people have stolen every cord so they just don't stock it. Furthermore, that is not a normal docking connector. I recommend brining a male-to-male headphone jack cable and you'll be good to go!
- Bathroom sliding door leaves very little privacy. You may want to blast the TV in there and run bathtub if you want to cover up any awkward sounds. Or just use the lobby restrooms. 
- Like most places, you pay for internet.. But I have a free mobile hotspot feature on my phone so we just used that and were fine. 
- Charged me $1.25 for local calls. Remember to use your cell phone going forward.

This was the worst hotel experience I've ever had!

When I walked into my room I was overpowered by the smell of cigarettes. It wasn't just a stale cigarette smell either, it smelled like it had been smoked in recently and a lot. I went to the front desk to see if I'd accidentally been given a smoking room. They said I was in a non-smoking room on a non-smoking floor. There were no more rooms for me to switch at that time so I was told to come back between 11 and 1 the next day. When I went back at that time, the line was a million years long and I didn't have time to wait because I was there for a wedding. After the wedding, I was again told there was no room to switch me to. 

Meanwhile, my friend went back to the room to sleep and requested extra blankets. When she got them, one was dirty and sticky. Fabulous quality control there!

The next day I went to complain about the room, AGAIN. I was again told there were no rooms and nothing they could do. I asked to talk to a manager and he just shrugged at me and said there was nothing he could do. 

The next morning at check out I talked to another manager who said if I'd talked to him right away he could have helped me, but since I was checking out there was nothing he could do. I told him I had talked to a manager the night before and he did nothing! He said the best he could do would be a free breakfast buffet in the hotel. Yeah, thanks, that really makes up for waking up with coughing every morning and sleeping like shit in a filthy, stinking room. And by the way, he said the smoking floor was above my floor so the smell was probably coming in through the air vents. I wonder if every room on that floor smelled like mine. There were a lot of people in that breakfast buffet with comped meals.

In addition to that, other people from the wedding group were staying in that hotel and of the 5 groups, 3 of them had problems with their rooms. Two were in the upgraded GO rooms and even then had troubles getting their issues solved. 

Do NOT stay at this hotel! The rooms are gross, smelly and run down. Even the nicer rooms are falling apart and management will do nothing to help you if you have a problem. The free breakfast did not make up for 3 terrible nights in this place. I will never stay here and would not wish this place on my worst enemies. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!",5,0,0

I would have to really think about staying at any Caesars property.  The staff at the craps tables were great and were friendly.   


As many of you know when you go to Vegas, you typically would spend your evenings out and subsequently you are sleeping in to recover.  My buddies and I slept in (we shared 2 connected rooms) and didn't want to be woken by the housekeepers, so we put the do not disturb signs on the door.

 

That evening around 7pm after checking the Mob museum and Fremont St, I noticed a message on the room phone and I was told that since we had the do not disturb sign up that we could call to let Housekeeping know they could clean the room.  Since we really only needed new towels, I called customer service and asked to have Towels sent up, they said they will send some up, and no one came.  After 2 hours and calling two more times with the last call where I asked that it be escalated to supervisor, customer service said that a Housekeeping supervisor was looking into it.  The 3rd customer service had an attitude and when I asked will they confirm that the towels were definitely coming, she kept asking 'Have I solved your problem?'.  Since I didn't have the towels or confirmation from someone in the hotel, I would say no.    We decided that we were spending way too much time dealing with this left to go to the Rio seafood buffet (which is no longer worth it anymore as they don't have unlimited lobster anymore) and had to rush to eat as they closed at 10.  After stuffing our face with seafood and prime rib, I certainly would like to wash up but we got back to find no towels and I called customer service a fourth time at midnight, the customer service agent said that there was some staffing issues in housekeeping and they were going to take off that day's resort fee.  I asked why that should affect delivering some towels since they've now had five hours.  After another 20 minutes, I called again and insisted on speaking to a manager.  The customer service manager mentioned that they weren't onsite and had to call the front desk to arrange for someone to get me the towels within 20 minutes.  He also said he would take off the resort fee.   Someone finally delivered the towels saying sorry there was a shift change.

Seriously, who cares about the resort fees?  How about providing some honest answers, I can understand and accept reasonable explanations why there may be some problems.  How about doing that on the 2nd call after the first 30 minutes? Maybe following up after the 2nd call to make sure I got the towels.   Case management is not very hard to manage, you would think that a hospitality business would have this down.

After a night of gambling, drinking and getting back from a club, I stopped at the front desk to ask about late check out and since I was there I asked to speak to the front desk manager.  So Renata, the manager was called over, who by the way came over when an attitude as I was interrupting whatever she was doing with some paperwork, five feet away.  I told her about the towel issue and asked what was going on.  Her attitude and response just aggravated me.  Renata kept saying, it was her Monday and she didn't know what had happened and that the resort fees had been removed from my room bill.  I told her that she can put the fees back on because I don't care about the fees, I want to know why it took 6 hours and 5 calls to get the towels? 

Now, I admit that most people would accept the $70 and let it go but I ask why?  The customer service call center was pointing fingers at Housekeeping and Renata was pointing fingers at Housekeeping and the call center while saying its her Monday.  Where's the accountability?  I'm really surprised that the managers who are face to face with guests in the morning aren't looking out for anything that stands out (like a guest calling 5 times about the same issue overnight) regarding customer service because it's usually gets brought up during checkout.

The point of coming to Vegas is to have a good time, if the hotel middle managers aren't held accountable for their staff, then this will happen again and mess up other people's weekend.   I travel a lot for business and subsequently stay in a lot of hotels.",1,0,0

I must admit that I wasn't too happy with this hotel\/casino.  On the postive end, I did enjoy lounging out by the pool on the one nice warm day we had.  It was very relaxing, but also very crowded.  However, there is NO complimentary breakfast as I found to be true with most hotels in Vegas.  Their breakfast buffet was $15\/person and dinner prices were around $26 PER person.  We didn't even bother paying those ridiculous prices and ate elsewhere at places such as Denny's and Burger King.  The carpeting is very old and worn out, even inside the rooms themselves.  The rooms also look nothing like they do in the pictures here on yelp.com.  However, I did think the rooms were a nice size for two people.  Now, another thing I didn't like was that it took us an avg. of 15 min. just to walk from the entrance of Flamingo to get to our room on the 4th floor.  We had to walk through the entire casino to the elevators, then had to walk down at least 2 entire hallway lengths (which were long) to finally reach our room.  It was just a real pain.

Checking in is a nightmare. Every time I saw the line to either check in or check out, it was backed up all the way into the hallway where the shops are. If you haven't figured out the express checkout on the phone then your in trouble.

The Parking garage is AWFUL. Floors 3-7 are open to hotel guests, floors 1-3 are reserved for ""grand vacations"" or valet parking. That leads me to the next note. Valet parking is worse than the parking garage -- if that's even possible. You'll circle the garage 10-15-20 times and see a ton of open spaces on the reserved valet floors but the line to valet is 50 cars deep. Are the valet people just sitting around picking their noses? Park at the Cromwell and walk over.. you'll save about 3 hours of your time.

The ""Spa elevators"" are on its last leg. Every time I got into one I thought for sure we were going to get stuck and breakdown. There's no air conditioning in the hallways of the room floors either so don't stay here during the summer!

The short explanation is, there is a reason this hotel was half the price of the others. They're undergoing renovations right now, so they'll probably be pretty nice soon, but they're so far behind the other hotels on the strip as far as updated and being nice. 

Even worse though, the hotel just looked and felt dirty. The carpet in the hallways were disgusting. The rooms were interesting because they were half updated, but the bathrooms were old and dingy. 

The AC didn't seem to work well at all, but I think it was due to how drafty the room was. I had to crank the AC all the way down and even then, had to turn the fan to always on and was still warm.

We stayed in the rooms near the habitat, which required some navigating to make your way out to the strip. Upon arrival, the first thing you'll notice is the massive line to check in. Expect about 20-30 minute wait. There was a line our entire stay, it was obscene. Similarly, there is a line at the total rewards desk constantly, and a line at the bell desk.

The room was one of the refurbished ones, decent appearance, with automatic drapes which was nice. The TV was not nice. The refurbished rooms had a bathroom with a tv built into the mirror. The mirror tv did not work and would only display the Spanish channel.

I notified the front desk that the bathroom tv didn't work and described the problem. A guy quickly showed up with replacement remote batteries for the other tv (fail #1) and then I described the problem again and he said it was the tv that is broken and not the remote anyway (fail #2) so he'd send a technician. That was 6:45pm. The technician showed up 4 hours later and woke me up (yeah that was early at 10:45 in Vegas but no need to go into detail there)... Fail #3. I said I was sleeping and to please return the next day to fix. An hour later, a technician shows up to fix the tv and wakes me up again. Fail #4 with a similar resulting explanation. The next day I describe to the front desk after waiting in the long front desk line the situation. The agent leaves to go get a manager (I presume). I wait 15 minutes for her to come back. Fail #5. The manager after further explanation says they'll take off the $22.44 resort fee. Fine, I don't even care about the tv, wasn't a big deal, just the poor service. Get back to my room and find a little note next to the room tv (the non-broken tv) that a technician stopped by and tested it an it is working fine and that I should push the buttons firmly (Fail #6).

Anyway, we did enjoy our stay and later checked out, got our receipt and noticed the resort fee was not deducted as promised (Fail #7).

Had VIP meet & greet tix that cost $350.00 each. Flamingo charges for pictures with Olivia at the meet & greet and do not allow you to take your own pictures. For a $350 tix you should get at least one free picture then buy others if you wish. The photographers take anywhere from 5-6 pictures of you interacting with Olivia then expect you to buy them. In July 2015 the price of each picture was $45.00. In December 2015 the price was $35.00 for the 1st pic and $20.00 for each additional pic. In January 2016 the pics were now $35.00 each. When we attended January 26, 2016, there were 4 people working the after m&g photos. Each one of the 4 were charging their own price for pictures. Heavy black guy named Justin and little pimply Hispanic guy named David were jerks when questioned about prices. We watched them charge $135.00 for 6 pics ($22.50 each) to one girl but charge $210.00 for 6 pics to another couple ($35.00 each). One guy got 3 pics for $75.00 (25.00 each). It became quite clear that they would manipulate the price of a guest who was only wanting to buy one pic to get them to buy more and quite obvious that some of the star-struck fans were taken advantage of in buying numerous photos of them conversing with ONJ at full price. These photomat rejects probably get commission on volume of sales. I'm sure ONJ would not be happy if she knew how her guests were being treated by these people after the meet & greet but I'm sure it's in her contract that the Flamingo gets all photo profits.",1,1,0

The ONLY good thing about this place is the location.  I really is convenient walking distance to other places on the strip.  However that really is only for daytime when you are in comfy shoes.  Walking distance does not matter at night when you are all dressed up and in heels.  Splurge $10 on a cab for that.  We reserved a 2 queen mini suite and were told we could have a roll away bed brought up at night.  First of all they charge an additional $30 to check in before 3pm. WHAT!?!?  You mean you actually have a room for us but we have to pay to get in early?  Who does that?  The Flamingo does.  They take nickel and diming to a new level. We asked for a fridge... $15.  And we could not control temp on it so it froze what we put in it and well they don't give you a micro to fix that.  The carpets leading the rooms are horrid.  You could easily trip on them as they have not bothered to fix them.  The bathroom.  Wow.  How can a bathroom in a hotel like this be so small.  I think if it were 1 person in a room the bathroom might be tolerable but more than that causes a riot.  But then again, 1 person should not tolerate the sour smell of the towels or the condition of the faucets.  When it was time for bed our 1st night we called down for the roll away as instructed and they told us we could not have one in a room with 2 beds.  Ummm.  But you told us we could have one.  By the way you also told us our room had an observation deck which apparently does not exist at Flamingo.  Basically these people made up story after story.  No integrity.  We did 1 night here and moved to Trump.  Now they gave us a fight when we tried to cancel but we were not having it.  How bout Trump was the same price as Flamingo.  They let us check I early at no cost.  There rooms have tons of space, huge bathrooms and a kitchen area.  Not to mention Trump service is GREAT!  So if you need location, don't do Flamingo.  Try another hotel on the strip.  Trump is not right on the strip but they have shuttle service and it was great.

We tried calling the front desk from the room phone and had no luck until we called from our cell phones and told us to call the operator and they'd redirect us.

Pizza from the casino is no good. I was really sick the day after and couldn't totally enjoy the activities planned because I had bubble guts all day.

The pool party was pretty fun and although the drinks were pricy, they were strong. Maybe too strong. I'm trying to enjoy a drink, not get wasted off it. Went to the pool both Friday and Saturday.

There are a few small quirks. For example, the first thing you typically do when you get to your hotel room is turn on a light. Unfortunately, the light switch next to the door isn't connected to one. An employee in the hall told us that there used to be a light connected to that switch but when the hotel remodeled they put a mirror where the light used to be. Mirrors are nice...but light is important. So I had to feel my way to the bathroom so I could turn on that light before finding my way into the room. 

The rooms are decorated with modern, updated furniture. The mattress is very firm, so whether or not you like that will depend on personal preference. However, the bathroom was not included in the makeover. 

The daily resort fee ($18) is charged regardless of whether or not the services are used. We did use the wifi everyday. We did not use the gym at all. Limited hours. It would be nice if it was open later or if the hot tub was included in the high daily fee. If you want to use the hot tub it is an additional $10\/person\/day. 

Housekeeping was great for the most part. I wish the hotel had a process in place if you want to re-use your towel. We received fresh towels daily which seemed like a little bit of a waste. Most hotels have a sign that says if you want fresh towels to leave them on the floor and if you want to re-use keep them hanging. It could save a lot of cost and resources if guests are given the option.

My biggest complaint was that on our day of check-out we received a knock on our door asking if we wanted the room cleaned. We had the do not disturb sign on the door. After talking with the person knocking on doors it was pretty clear they just want to make sure we are checking out that day. I could understand the knock if it was check-out day and after check out time, however this was at about 9am. Luckily, we were up and getting ready to be out of the room, but I was offended that the do not disturb was just ignored and would have been upset if I had been sleeping.

Long gone are the glory days of Bugsy's mob-friendly Hollywood-Glamour-in-the-Desert.... The Flamingo is no longer the most luxurious hotel in the world. In fact, I find it fair to say that Siegel's El Cortez could give the Flamingo a lesson or two in dealing with the effects of aging and realistic expectations. 

If I could give 0 or negative stars, I would.

Giving the Elton John show another visit this past Friday night, my friend and I decided to stay on the Strip instead of taking taxis all over the place. Same price, less hassle, and a night out on the town. Win, win... or so we thought. Caesars and Sir Elton were fabulous... but that's not why we're here, eh?

Checking in was a little slow; and sadly, we used the regular line instead of Gold Card VIP access and had faster service! We were checked in quickly and easily by a young lady who barely looked at us (I hate that; make some kind of connection so that people feel happy to stay with you, eh?) and we headed upstairs to drop off our stuff.

The room was dark, shades drawn, and, wait. Is that garbage in the can? Is that a trash bag on the table? Um, wait, I just tripped over someone's shoes?! 

*turn on a light*

Holy sh....

The room was already occupied!

*run downstairs*

I was greeted at the desk by a manager-esque looking person and explained to her that our room was occupied. She said I would have to wait a moment and continued buffing her nails or stacking her room keys or whatever it was. I half-wish I was just being mean, but it truly was something ridiculous and mundane and she kept looking at her hands\/nails.

She finally gets to the computer and starts looking it up. Without saying much of anything for a few minutes, she finally says we've been upgraded to a junior suite to make up for the inconvenience. Our ire is subsiding with this news. We thank her then head upstairs...

... to what we will discover over the next 12 hours is the dirtiest, dingiest, fallingest-apart room in all of Las Vegas.

It looked like it was furnished via the fire sale at Sahara. In fact, my verbal review to dinner party guests the next night was that it looked like it belonged at the Sahara... after the pillaging occured.

The shower tile wasn't just stained, it was dirty and could be wiped off. The shower curtain had dried I-don't-know-what on it. The toilet paper dispenser was coming out of the wall, the cabinets were dirty and in disrepair, the carpet wasn't anything I'd want to walk on barefoot, and the headboard became detached from it's 2 small screws (I could turn that into a great story, but it came off too easily to truly make it my own). A dangerously broken electrical socket scared the crap out of me. And then, the piece de resistance.... there were stains on the ceiling?!

This isn't about wanting a 5-star room in a 3-3.5 star resort, this is about wanting a clean, comfortably appointed, well appreciated and well cared-for room in which I paid money to stay.

The ridiculousness that was this filthy, ill-appointed, uncomfortable ""junior suite"" is almost laughable but for the fact that no one cared. I can't laugh because no one cared to help us to find something worthy of the Flamingo name. No one cared to clean it. No one cared enough to make it look and feel like a suite versus a communal college dorm room after being lived in for four years by mythical couch-surfing, party-minded students that have never heard of a sponge or an art print or a vacuum or soap.

When I brought all of this to someone's attention, I was given a half-hearted ""sorry for the inconvience"" mumble. Really? You care so little that a room that is filthy and dangerously falling apart is simply an inconvenience?!

However, it only took about 5 minutes to check in.  This was the best part of the trip.  We got to our room, opened the door and both said, ""Wow, this place has gone downhill!""

The lady at the desk got the manager to let her know the problem.  The manager then told us that it is a very old hotel and they know about the problem.  She assured me the engineers hve given the room an all clear and it is safe to have the window broken like that.  What?!!! They know about it and they put someone in that room anyway.  I also said the TV didn't work and she said she was very sorry.  They never offered to switch our room or at least take off the useless resort fee. Then to top it all off as I was going to the elevators there were two nasty prostitutes by the slots annoying the guests and making a scene.  I was just glad we only booked for one night and then we switched to another hotel.  I am going to stick with MGM properties from now on!  If we have any problems at the MGM resorts they correct it immediately.  I will never stay at the Flamingo again.",2,2,0

The rooms were clean. It seemed that they did some remodeling but didn't go all the way with it. All the bathroom fixtures seemed like they were original. Dated tiling in the bathroom but it did have an updated large granite counter top. The room itself had some kind of hard wood flooring, I liked it because carpets tend to stain and who knows what gets trapped in the fibers. The first night we got stuck in room 10150, everything about the room was great, except the music coming from the Linq walkway. There was loud music blasting all night and day. The worst part of this was that I could hear two different songs at the same time, from the bars in the walkway. This was intolerable and we got moved to another room, facing the opposite side, into the Flamingo courtyard. Overall I would stay here again because of the convenient location and sufficient rooms.",0,0,0

All the staff couldn't be more friendly, the room was spotless, the Bose sound system great, and the TV's, 42"" in the bedroom and one in the bathroom mirror, Wow!

They went all out for us.  We also ate at Margaritaville and Tropical Breeze Cafe.  At both places the Staff were great and service was wonderful.  The food, fantastic!

The Casino was fun and very busy all the time.  Grounds were beautiful, with the Flamingos and other birds.

We saw the Donny and Marie Show while we were here, it was great!  My husband only wanted to go because of me, but he loved it!

We parked Valet and it was easy.  Our bags took about 10 minutes to get to our room.  When it was time to leave, took about the same amount of time.  Everyone was friendly and polite.

The flamingos, the Koi and the ducks swimming in the pond, are all really fun to watch and enjoy. The casino is pretty nice, laid out well so you can find your way around pretty easily, and has all the usual table and slot games. Now for the hotel part...

Our arrival at 11:30 pm was absolute chaos. I had checked in online and had nifty little QR codes to scan in the check-in kiosks. I felt pretty smug about avoiding the line that was 50+ people deep waiting for two desk clerks (out of 15 available posts). However, the kiosks did not work. I got error codes telling me I had to see a reservation desk clerk to check in. Into the line we went. This was a slow-moving line of exhausted, frustrated, and downright angry people. We waited for 45 minutes to check in and then finally went to find our rooms. 

I had reserved ""Fab"" rooms, not realizing these are the lowest tier of room they offer. The size was fine, we did not get the view of the High Roller I had reserved, but I was too tired to care. The next day I *wished I had cared more: the music from the age 21+ ""GO"" pool was relentless, a deep thumping bass all day and well into the night that we heard 19 floors up. The room seemed clean, although really beat up and old. The bathroom sink was cracked into about 8 pieces, the tub was chipped, the wallpaper peeling, and the furniture looked like someone went after it with a hammer. There was a shockingly uncomfortable ""couch"" sort of thing, hard, flat, vinyl, with a deep seat and two stiff cylinder pillows. During the night I stepped in a wet spot on the carpet. Daytime inspection revealed housekeeping had scrubbed *something out of the carpet. My daughter and I had bets on blood or vomit. The TV worked and the best part was I was able to access the HDMI port and watch movies from my iPad (lots of hotels have a box covering the ports so you are forced to watch TV).

The ""amenities"" in these rooms are minimal: a 1-oz tube of body lotion and 1-oz of shampoo-conditioner combo. Room service ends mid-afternoon. Wi-fi costs $16\/day for two devices. We didn't ask staff for anything, so I have no idea if they are responsive or not. There were a dozen conventions in town (at the end of July!) and every hotel was packed. 

Be prepared to take a hike through the Habitat to find the two pools, and do not do it barefoot in the summer! The main ""family"" pool was pretty nice and the water very refreshing, even at mid-afternoon in 108 degree heat. Cool water is constantly flowing into the pool. The GO pool next door requires ID but the really loud music made it hard to talk even in the family pool. The drinks are EXPENSIVE ($17 for a regular gin & tonic).  The Buffet was okay. We had brunch there and they had the typical array of breakfast foods along with lunch items like fried chicken and several stir-fry dishes. The staff were attentive and very sweet, keeping our waters filled and promptly clearing dishes.

Visited 3 different rooms on this trip. 
Go Room Suite: We were offered this upgrade before arriving and was worth the extra space.   Same as other Go Rooms with an extra living room which had a decent pull out bed.  Could easily sleep 6.  Nice shower that would fit 3-4 people if wanted a well.  (To save water of course ;)  )

Standard room: Had friends staying here.   It was recently updated and seemed really clean.  I was impressed.  3 years ago I stayed in one that was like a Motel 6.  Very doable on a budget.   (Find a $50\/night room anywhere else like this and you'd give it 5*.)

Large Suite (Neopolitan I think? )  Pretty awesome place for your own group party.   Had a large bar,  dining table,  and 3 bed, 3 bath.  Overlooking Caesars and fountains.   $850 on Saturday night.   Split that a few ways though and you are able to feel like you and your crew are part of a movie.  Do take out and eat in like a rock star overlooking the strip which you are about to tear up! 

The pool has thee best affordable day club scene in the city.   They play more mellow music from around 9-11. Then it's cranks up a couple of notches till around 1pm when this place starts really hopping.  DJ'S were doing mashups of 70\/80's rock and pop to new hip hop beats.  They killed.   Note,  you may see a few,  or a few hundred slightly enibriated people shaking to their own groove.  This place is more blue collar and less D-bag.  (Except us! )

We split a cabana between 10 of us comfortably.  $715 total I think which included 1 bottle plus mixers,  epic fruit tray, $100 towards other food or bevs.  It was the only way I could be at this amazing pool scene from 9am-5pm.  Had a tv that no one watched.   Best day ever. 

You cannot do better for a central location or home base for your Vegas adventures.  The hotel was cleaner and friendlier than I remember from past visits.  I highly recommend using their online check in so you can go through the key\/mail line.  I also paid for the early  check in for $15.

No, the Bellagio or MGM Grand or a couple others might eclipse the aging Flamingo but its a great place to stay. There was a special going on Expedia that we found and for two round trip tickets from Baltimore to Vegas and 5 days at the Flamingo in the Go Rooms was $660. A pretty damned good deal.

We showed up to the hotel and had a little time to kill before our rooms were available. I'm sure it was just a way to get you to gamble a little bit and get a lay of the land for the casino. We checked our luggage and had it brought up to our rooms after they were ready. The Go Rooms are roomy enough, clean, and we had a great view of the strip. Our rooms were cleaned in the morning and always had a nice made bed. Room service said they were backed up but food was brought only after about 20 minutes. Decent food...good when you're back from the casinos or a show nice and drunk.

The crowning point of the hotel isn't the casino though. Or the rooms, the places to eat but its the location and the pool. The hotel sits right on the strip and in the middle of everything. It has a monorail access point at the bottom of the hotel which makes transportation easy.

The pool though was my favorite. A large pool with 4 waterfalls was where I spent a good time sleeping off hangovers and resting up for the crazy nights to come. There are tons of room to sit, but with so many people coming and going, space is at a premium. The pool is clean and cool, a great place to beat the heat. The hotel does offer a topless pool but I can't speak on that. I do believe its free for women and $10 for male guests except Friday and Saturday when it is $20. Cabanas are available around the pool but you can't get sun in a covered Cabana!! There are gorgeous waitresses in tiny pink bikinis that will take your drink orders and sometimes Chippendales guys come around and hand tickets out to the ladies.

I've gambled here on previous visits but this was the first time I've stayed.  It's good bang for the buck, has a nice pool (but not open after dark - WTF?) and I love the little memorial to  Bugsy Siegel.  It ought to be on the strip - the man is to Vegas what Balboa is to Mexico... for better and for worse.

Two stars deducted for the policy (also being enforced next door at Bill's) of requiring gamers to bet the maximum on video poker to get drinks comp'ed - HELLO: IF I WANT TO BE NICKEL AND DIMED I'LL GO TO FOXWOODS.  No way to treat your customers - especially when you live in a town that's one recession away from reverting to dunes, cactus and snakes.

Can't beat the location - why stay at Caesar's or the Bellagio when you can walk there in 5 minutes?  The only places with lower prices are ones like Circus Circus or Stratosphere where you can't walk anywhere.  The Flamingo is also surrounded by the older smaller casinos (Bill's, O'Sheas, Casino Royale, etc) that are more pedestrian-friendly if you walk on the strip.

Oh yeah, you can do the nasty with the blinds open - the hotels across the strip are 1\/4 mile away and the Flamingo windows are covered with advertising printed on perforated stuff stuck over the windows - can't take a picture out of your room, but nobody can see in either ;)

But the drinks thing stuck in my craw - all Vegas has going for it is sports betting, easy comps and network effect - every casino is sharing bettors with every other casino.  Forget the girls - Tijuana beats Pahrump, and you can phone up an escort at home.  Forget the strip clubs - I can get the same thing in Providence or Montreal for half the cost. Forget the weather - half the damn country is desert.  Forget the glamour - Manhattan, West LA and Waikiki have just as much eye candy and a lot more to do than the strip.

Frankly, vegas has the vibe of Detroit about 1970.  Lots of alcoholics working the sports books for those drink tickets that they hand out now (which cannot be used for brand-name liquor).

I usually stay at Excalibur because they offer the types of bets i like to make.
I debated on staying someplace else this time and i decided on this resort because their website said that they have a KENO LOUNGE. That is a lie.
According to the workers in the sports book, it was taken out two years ago. So the ad isnt a mistake. It would appear that they want to deceive guests to get them here.
That is a ""Bait and Switch"" or at the very least, false advertising.
I will stay at Excalibur next time.
Update: I decided to bring this to the attention of the management.
She thanked me and said that she would let marketing know so that they could change it.
Im glad for that. 
Although i dont expect to receive anything, they didnt offer a comp. I know that they do that in certain situations. In this case i think that it would be appropriate.
Whenever i play KENO (which is all the time), I have to leave the resort. I should be offered something for my inconvenience. Since the only reason that Im staying here is because they offer a KENO LOUNGE. Maybe they could rent me a standard room at a resort that has KENO. Maybe they thought that i need the exercise to walk to other resorts.",1,1,0

And as you know those usually turn out to be fucking amazing or you waking up Sunday morning on the floor with a pizza stuck to your face (speaking from experience).

Got the studio suite which was supposedly to be in the renovated tower but can you please explain why they couldn't of coughed up some $ and get a decent media alarm clock (Bose\/ihome). They still had the janky clock that probably was there when it first opened. 

The room did have a nice view of the high roller Ferris wheel, and they prob had a nice view of me strolling around naked when I decided it was a good idea to drink half a bottle of 151 and forget to close my blinds. Sorry guys send the therapy bills to my accountant.

Room didn't really have amenities but the front desk guy was kind enough to send up a mini fridge to my room. Probably the same fridge my ex uses to store her cold heart every night.

Downside of this trip was getting food poisoned from the omelette and them not wanting to refund the money. Really guys? I'll slide into the DM with screenshot of the vomit if need be. The television also didn't work for 80% of the channel. And for the first time ever (not a complaint) didn't find a bible in my room. Come on guys, who do I pray to now to ensure success at the blackjack table?

Bed was comfortable but not sure what the thread count was on the sheets. They also don't have any restaurants that really stands out here so I would suggest going across to Caesar for bacchanal or if you lost all your money betting on the ponies, can go to earls at Caesar instead.

Last but not least, if mangament reads this, can you please for the love of God and my future son who will be a world class ping pong player to fix the elevators? I got stuck 3 times in the elevator in be one day I stayed at your hotel. Door would jam and not open all the day.

Most hotels provide such complementary as long as a room is available. My flight got in at 10 am, after a night of 1 1\/2 hour sleep, and had to wait until 4pm to check in. Luckily my friends allowed me to put my luggage in their room. The check-in clerks were more like robots then people caring for customers. When asked how early could I check in without paying extra $30, was told at 2pm for $20. When asked how early could I check in without paying extra, was told 4pm, not 3:15, 3:30 or 3:45 [I specifically asked]. I have never experienced such narrow, controlling \/money hungry attitude and I have stayed at very nice hotels. Then there is the $25 resort fee, don't know what this covers, because it cost to use wifi, there's no complimentary business center, at least 1 pool was closed, I had to ask for a coffee pot delivered to my room...a coffee pot!!!!!. Coffee pot is standard for a motel 6! 

I had to pay $5 at UPS center just to print out my boarding pass [just to visit the website and print out 1 page cost me $5!!!] , again what I am getting for the $25 resort fee? You don't even get 24 hours, only 19 and anything more cost extra. When asked about late check out, again for an extra cost, they did allow a noon check out without cost. But again, I had to put my luggage in friend's room since my flight wasn't until 3:30. From a hotel stay perspective, it was not a pleasant stay, did not feel like a human being, but a dollar sign. And no one offered to store my luggage as your website displays. You should be ashamed of yourselves, money is not everything. I don't plan on ever staying at this hotel again, no people\/customer relations, just dollars, dollars, dollars!

So on to my experinces...

1) Check in was a nightmare, there was a super long line, a couple of flustered peope behind the check out desk...but as I waited I drank...then drank some more...thank GOD for booze and I was feeling no pain after the almost 1.5 hours it took to get through the line and check in.

2) Got to our room, seemed nice enough although not too clean...oh well..I'm not picky..I'll deal with it.  Wanted to take a shower after the flight and long check in prior to our dinner reservations, did not check for towels first, never had too before in any other hotel I stayed at, got into the shower and waited for hot water...waited for warm water, gave up and waited for luke warm water...semi tepid water...anything....water continued to be freezing cold after 25 mins of running it.

I got out of the cold shower and noticed that there were no towels...like not even one...just a wash cloth.  Now I'm not a small girl...no way that wa going to cut it.  Had to get dressed while still totally wet.

Dripping wet and cold I was still in a fairly jovial mood..I was in Vegas after all! nothing was going to get me down!!  Unfortunately that all changed when I attempted to speak to someone about the cold water.
I spoke with Teresa who was supposed to be a manager, she was snippy and overtly rude and decidely uncaring about the situation.  Took me three more phone calls to get them to deal with the problem.

Waited 20 mins, housekeeping finally arrived with towels-they seemed surprised that we would think that towels came with the room (?)
Waited for the maintenance person who ran the water for another 20mins and then declared that no hot water was to be had in this room.

We called the front desk again, they were very rude, told us that we would either need to move to the smoking room on the top floor or the wheelchair accessible room.  We choose that top floor as they said that it was an upgrade.

I was mad that we would have to give up the King room we booked for a double queen....but beyond that they made the whole prcess of changing rooms such a pain, my good mood was gone at this point!!

We were escorted by security to get our things, then back down to the front desk to collect our new room key...it was nuts and totally unessessary.  They were unapologietic about the whole matter...we just wanted our room!!

3) We got to the new room and immediately I noticed that it had not been cleaned in some time, the light switches were flithy, the hair dryer did not work, there was a panty liner behind the bed (gross) along with an assortment of water bottle caps and huge dust bunnies.  The view was good as it was of the wheel, however there was not much else about the room that was positive.

And once again there were no towels!!!!

I set off on a mission to find a cleaner and more importantly a cleaning cart with supplies.  I spoke to the maid on the floor and explained what I found in our room, shesimply shrugged her shoulders and said that I could call the front desk.  Noting my terrible experience with them already, I decided to not call and take matters into my own hands.  I proceeded to help myslef to the fresh towels on the cart, and some cleaning supplies....YES ladies and gentlemen...I cleaned our friggin' room!!!!!  And let me say that I do take some pride in saying that I did a phemonimal job of it!!!!  They should hire me to train their housekeeping staff.

4) We got up early the next day and did not return to our room until almost 6:30pm to shower and change for our evening out.....I could not believe it...no housekeeping staff had bothered to turn up!!!  no clean towels for our showers (we left the days previous towles in the bathtub as is customary to request fresh towels) Needless to say I set out on a mission again to find a cleaning cart.  Thankfully I found someone at teh end of the hall, I advised them that our room had not been cleaned...no fresh towels...and you guessed it...she didn't care.
I took some towels off her cart, enough for the next two days...and stomped off.

5) told the manager later at the front desk-someone named Josh-he apologized and comped us a free breakfast-thanks but doesnt make up for all the work cleaning I did...lol

6) Be ready to be totally harrassed by a ton of people posing to be Flamigo hotel staff wanting to give you a ""free gift"" they are trying to sell time shares and sign you up for a 2+ hour presentation-THEY WILL NOT LEAVE YOU ALONE THE ENTIRE TIME AND ARE VERY AGGRESSIVE EVEN WHEN TOLD NO!",4,1,0

The lighting in the room was not bright enough for work, and $14 a day for Internet access?! There's so many other ways to gauge a guest, like charging for breathing. Heaven forbid you need something printed - it's so convoluted, and you only have 15 minutes to get it done or you repeat the whole process. 

Why no soap dishes? Our room was only vacuumed once during my three-night stay. The refrigerator didn't work. The bathroom fan was not functional; it didn't ventilate the area, and every time you turned the light off, the fan let out a death rattle that was no longer funny the 19th time you heard it.

Its not Caesar's Palace. However, its 1\/4 of the price and you can't beat the location, dead center strip across from Caesars and very close to the Bellagio.

PROS
*Very affordable
*Excellent location
*Clean
*Wildlife habitat is very nice and a little different. There are a few tables so you can sit and have a cup of coffee in the am and relax in a very nice setting. 
*Pool is awesome, better than many more expensive hotels
*Casino is usually lively
*Beds are very comfy, not too hard, not too soft
*""Burger Joint"", a new restaurant in the Flamingo is pretty darn good. Its a lower end rip off of the Burger Bar in Mandalay. The decor is really cute, black and white with hot pink and you can mix and match burgers, buns and toppings. Very tasty. 

CONS

*Old, tired decor, ugly motel style bathrooms. Shower curtains (ick!)
*Housekeeping needs some serious work. Nothing was dirty, but the housekeeping seemed lazy. Our first night they failed to show up! We were missing an ice bucket. Often they would take the dirty towels but not replace all of them. Refills of toiletries were skimpy. 
*Room service wasn't great. There was an hour and a half wait for food at midnight. When we got our food, it tasted like it had been sitting around. It was edible, but not worth room service prices. We ordered chicken wings, fries and chicken fingers (hard and over battered). Sandwiches and breakfast are probably a better bet. There is no 24 hour cafe so room service is the only option late at night. 
*The curtains don't block the light completely like they do in most hotels. This was annoying, I like a really dark room to sleep. 


Bottom line: it isn't very fancy and you don't get superior service, but its more than adequate for the price. We stayed during the 4th of July weekend and it was really cheap. If you're very picky, spring for a higher end place, but more easy going people will get a great bargain.",1,0,0

The whole time we were there only 2 or 3 elevators were working so we had to find our way through the employee back room maze to get up and down.

It a hardwood floor (hybrid?), which was nice, instead of disgusting Vegas hotel carpeting. Plenty of space, clean, nice tv.  I've been to the Flamingo a number of times and have yet to get a back view.  The strip view is obviously the best but even the 'back' view isn't back, now, if you don't mind a big ass glowing Ferris wheel. 

However... BRING A POWERSTRIP!!  No, I'm serious. At least in my room, there was a severe lack of power outlets and the six plugs that were available were being used by their alarm clock, lamps, etc. So, you have to start unplugging their stuff.  I was trying to do some work with a computer, hard drive, etc., and I had to work with the lights unplugged. 

Maybe I haven't been to Vegas in a while but check-in is 4pm...FOUR. Super lame. You have to pay $15 extra to check in around 1 or 2... lame. I had to because I assumed, like most hotels, check in would be a normal time. 

Pool. Now, good and bad. If you want a nice quiet time, those days are gone.  I used to like the quiet pool and I'm not even that old, nice and big.  However, they turned it into a ""pool party"" now.  If you're into that, cool... but if you have kids, you're hosed, but I think it's only on the weekends.  There is still a normal little pool area for families but it's right next to the music.  Also, this could be good or bad... if you're self conscious about how you look with a shirt off or in a bikini - don't sweat it here - believe me.  This was like the, um... how do you say it in a nice way... ""blue collar"" crowd.  Super red lobster tans, bellies, drunk guy on the pedestal with a beer bucket on his head.  I had fun though.  

Parking is tight.  I went during the construction of the neighboring Cromwell and there were guards by the parking lot, asking if we were guests.  The guy interrogated me, asking for me key card, but as I hadn't checked in yet, I was about to dig out the paperwork... but he 'believed me' and let me pass.  Sucks if you wanna come here to gamble though.  And, I got one of the only remaining rooftop parking spots.  Hopefully they cleared that up by now though.

All in all, this place isn't ""old,"" it's historic and there's some charm about it that I like, even though it can't match some of the other mega hotels.  It's right in that middle tier of Vegas hotels.",3,4,0

For years now we have always rotated our stays from the different Caesars properties whoever can give us the best offers at the time. Now that we've moved back in town we still from time to time check in just to have a mini getaway with the kids. We now gravitate to Flamingo as the kids enjoy their pools. We had family coming in from California so we decided to get ourselves a room as well and stay for 3 days.

Check in was easy enough and thankfully wasn't a circus show partly because Platinum members have a different registration area. We were given the GO rooms on the 25th floor so no complaints there. If you must stay at the Flamingo make sure you request the GO rooms as they are newer and have modern and upgraded fixtures. The bathroom has a separate shower and tub and the mirror has a tv built into it. The bed was really comfortable and clean. The rooms come with a coffee maker as well as a mini fridge. They also have a docking station you can use to play music, our remote for that though was missing batteries and the backing, I had called housekeeping to inform them of the situation and to request a replacement. They never brought it but it wasn't that big of a deal as we weren't planning on staying in the room much anyway but it's the principle of it. Wifi has improved greatly, the kids were actually able to use their ipad with no issues. On the 25th floor we had a great view of the Strip and the Bellagio water show.

The casino offers a variety of food option but none stands out, they have a newly opened food court that has Johnny Rockets, Bonnano's NY pizza, a sandwich place and a Chinese place similar to Panda. They also have a little coffee area that you can grab a quick bite before you head down to the pool. Make sure you also check out the Flamingos and Koi's they have in the garden.

Minor complaints are the elevators air conditioner weren't working and it was warm! Also that the kids pool area with the slides closes early at 4:30 and the other family pool at 5:00 it's strange to me that they would close so early in the summer time. Before checking out, I had to call Front desk services as I noticed an error on my bill, we were charged an extra $9.99 for web services when supposedly that is part of your resort fee. I would definitely stay here again but ONLY if the offer is for GO rooms though because unfortunately I have heard and read horror stories of the other towers.",9,1,2

Getting information out of the concierge, when they were even there, was a struggle. Finding a waitress while gambling was next to impossible. The dealers were less than friendly. Saturday night the Flamingo had several special events, so the parking garage was full. Guests had to park elsewhere. They also didn't have do not disturb signs in all of the rooms. Because they say ""Go Away"", I guess guest take them home, but the hotel does not replace missing signs. 

The building itself was great - lots of elevators, lovely pool area, PERFECT location. But the staff needs some serious work. Least friendly, least helpful people in all of Vegas.",0,0,0

Many of the hall ways looks like they were service entrances and there was duct tape uses in places that you should not see duct tape.  The room service menu was pathetic.  Sure it's on the strip and it's surrounded by some great shopping and nice hotels so it has that going for it but don't expect to be pampered or spoiled in this place.

The breakfast buffet is decent, and there's rarely a long wait. And, bottomless mimosas and champagne.

The pool, however, stinks. Well, the pool itself is nice, with slides and a waterfall, but if you're not out waiting in line before the pool even opens, then forget about getting a decent lounge chair anywhere near the sun.

When we checked in after 11pm, we had to wait another 45 minutes for our room to be cleaned.  It was a ineffective cleaning.  Upon opening the door to our ""premium"" room, the foul stench hit us.  Though labeled a ""non-smoking"" room, there was still a used ashtray in the bathroom.  The pungent odor of smoke was worse than gaming floors.  My wife and I are allergic to smoke, and this room was unacceptable.  The staff stated there was nothing that could be done to change rooms.  We were to check back the next day for a change, and that's when we were informed again, that we could not change rooms.

Check in wasn't until 4 PM...looked at the clock, 10 AM. Groan. Check in the bag. Waited for the guy to take our bag but he had to help the ""Platinum"" customers...jerks. 

The hotel wasn't bad overall. It is a bit run down. The elevators are crummy and one of the elevators is missing a button for the 4th floor. We stayed at the 18th floor a great view of the Imperal Palace. Awesome. To get to the room it was a long walk to the elevators. So if you ate too much food and need to get to the room for a quick relief, well good luck if you are at the other side of the building.

The service wasn't bad at all. The casino is really smokey. It is a older hotel but my lungs filled up quickly with smoke.

The GF and I went to the Nathan Burton Comedy Magic show. It wasn't bad at all. For $15.00 we got front row seats to the show. Not sure how we got VIP status. Though they did lose the photos that they tried to sell us. 

Walls are thin, you can sometimes hear people argue, talk or having hot wild sex. The shower is a pressure wash, it will wash all the oil off your skin.

- Check-in and check-out were fast since i did it through the machine.

- Great location.
-Comfortable bed.

- Interior looked so depressing, not really clean and desperately need a TLC.
- NOISY...i can hear noise from next room people talking clearly & loud music from outside.
- Resort fee ($32.63\/night) does not include refrigerator (extra $15).
- Free parking was a joke since it's open for public (everyone can park there) & a lot of spaces were reserved. No space was available and the only option was valet.

If the room rate + tax and fee under $100\/night i would stay here again but if it's more than $100\/night....go and find other hotel.

The back area also has a shrine to Bugsy Siegal, the legendary mobster. He used to have a room in the penthouse with a secret escape to a car that was always running with a driver ready to get away. He ended up getting killed in a hail of gunfire.

The flamingo was the very first hotel I stayed at when I went to Vegas for my very first time 3 years ago and now, each time we go, even though we're supposed to be staying at a new place I'm tempted to get rooms there again.

When I made reservations for the Flamingo I was a little hesitant based on some of the reviews from yelp. Mainly people discussed, the long lines to check in, the cleanliness etc.. Let me tell you about my experience....

We arrived at the Flamingo in the midst of summer (July) where it was at it's peak tourist time. We arrived about 4 hours early for check in but decided to take a chance at trying to check in anyways. The reviews were right, the line for check in was the longet I've ever seen, but in all fairness I heard a worker tell a walk-in tourist that their rooms were booked to capacity. When we arrived at the front of the line, the guy at the check-in counter informed us our room wasn't ready (not their fault we were 4 hours early). Here is where they score major points. Rather than making us come back and wait in line again, they gave us a room that was ready and just upgraded us to a room on the 17th floor with a view of the strip at no extra charge!

Now for the rooms. Make absolute sure that you get one of their recently remodeled ""GO Rooms."" Very cool. Hot pink lights in the bathroom, a tv in the bathroom mirror, curtains that open with the flick of a light switch and the bed...oh my goodness this was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in in my entire life. If I had a way of smuggling it out in my suitcase, I probably would have. 

Another plus for the Flamingo, it's located in a really great area of the strip where it's close to walk to just about anything. Most people might get turned off by the fact that this is an older hotel, but it really makes you think of ""the old vegas"" and you practically expect to see the Rat Pack waltzing in throught the doors.

I found that very silly. I had to come back to avoid the charge and wait in line again to get my room key, when I can just get it then and have it over with. I feel like this practice also makes it busier for them- they had to see me twice as opposed to one time, and the line to check in is already pretty long to begin with. It just doesn't make sense.

Once I checked in to my room, and luckily I didn't get stuck in the elevators that seemed a bit sketchy, I was able to unpack and rest to a renovated room which was actually very nice. I had a pleasant experience with the staff and the dealers at the hotel. And surprisingly, they had a decent pool party during the day.

We had to switch rooms 2 times, the first room was very dirty, had mold in the bathrooms, the furniture was in horrible condition (falling apart),and most of all it was not the room we were promised when we booked it. The front desk advised they would be sending housekeeping to our rooms to clean, when they arrived we opened the door, the man handed us sheets and pillow cases and walked off. While we were waiting to be moved, the front desk advised that our new rooms would be ready and available at 11:30 am, we called the front desk every 30 minutes after that to see if the room was ready. The new rooms were not available until almost 2pm. After being moved to the second room, we were told they we were being upgraded for the issues in the first room, not only were we not upgraded but the room was also moldy and very dusty. On the way to the front desk, another guest was in the elevator wishing us luck as she had switched rooms 4 times for the same reason and received the same run around we had.

After having our luggage moved to that room, the adjoining room (which we also had booked) A\/C wouldn't come on. We spoke to the night manager Theresa on Friday night, who advised us that, We ""are lucky to receive what we had, and to just deal with it"". Theresa also advised that, since we had 2 rooms to ""turn the unit that is working as low as it would go and open the adjoining room door so the other room would cool down for the night."" The manager was very hateful and rude but said she would send someone up to check it. Pete from maintenance came to the room while we were out and left a note stating a light bulb that was out had been changed and the A\/C was fixed. When we returned to the room the A\/C was still broken. We dealt with it for the night, called maintenance again the next day where a very nice man came up to the room and actually fixed the A\/C.

I have a list of hotels on the strip I want to stay at and this time  I decided to stay at The Flamingo. There is definitely some good and some bad. Here it is:

First off check in. Holy Mary mother of GOD what a cluster fuck. A million friggin people all over the place, people not sure where the line begins or ends, and like 3 people working to check all these people in. And check out was no picnic but more on that later. It took a little over an hour to check in. I have been to Vegas quite a bit and I have never had this big of a fiasco at check in. I knew it might be a little busy due to the holidays but that is no excuse for the lack of staff. Especially considering that check in is at 4pm and it was almost 5pm. They should have more staff working behind the counter at such hot times to better serve the amount of customers checking in especially since it was the holidays.  I have checked in at busy times in Vegas before and have never waited that long. After dealing with the flight and the airport and check in by the time I got to my room I just wanted to relax for a bit.

I had a good view of the strip which I appreciated. I have to say I liked the room. It was a big room. It was in the habitat area on the 19th floor. The bathroom was spacious as well. The beds were pretty comfy. They did the job. The TV worked fine. The shower was pretty good as well. The water pressure was fine and the temperature controls worked fine as well. I do have to say that the water coming out the sink, however, had a funky smell to it. I did not experience that with the shower but I did with the sink. The room safe did not work but when I called about it someone came up and promptly fixed it. That was addressed quickly which I appreciated. I ordered room service on the first night because I was hungry but too damn tired to walk around deciding what to get and that food was just ok. I ordered a seafood pasta. Nothing spectacular about it. The delivery was pretty fast and prompt. Overall, I thought the room was nice, spacious and comfortable. Great room for the price especially. 

The casino is a nice one. I always found plenty of tables to play at. For the most part the dealers were pretty friendly. One in particular stood from the rest and his name was Carlos. He made the games extra fun and he had an amazing personality to match his amazing looks. Him looking so good made it hurt less when he took my money in roulette. :-) In all seriousness though he is how a dealer should act. Fun and friendly. As far as the cocktail waitresses go I guess it depend son which one you have. Some of them would totally ignore you or not come by for hours on end while others made regular stops and were friendly to boot. That was more 50\/50. Overall I enjoyed the casino and even though I explored other casinos I found myself just wanting to gamble there. 

Check out was a bitch as well. Again at the hot button time to check out not enough staff. I opted for the express check out but that still had a long ass wait and was just as big a pain in the ass. When I saw the bill upon checkout I have to say I was pretty annoyed. They will nickel and dime you to DEATH. They charge a $29 a day resort fee. I know all the hotels charge a resort fee but still I think that is a little excessive. I also got charged for housekeeping services which I am in the process of debating right now because I never asked the maid to come everyday and make my bed. They just come and I am not about to pay for that. If I would have known that I was being charged like $20 every time they come I would have opted out. I had plenty of towels and did not need my bed made everyday. The interesting thing is I have NEVER been nickle and dimed like this at another Vegas hotel This is the only time this has happened so maybe it is not as much if bargain to stay here as some might think. 

Overall I am going to have to give this place three stars.  I am not too happy with the extra charges for housekeeping. The resort fee I will let slide because I knew about that but the rest of it makes me wonder if staying here is even worth it. I may just come here to gamble again but staying at the hotel I think I will pass.",1,2,0

In my opinion, the absolute best time to stay here  is the weekend when Jimmy Buffet plays in Vegas.  He plays Vegas every year at the MGM Grand, but he has a Margaritaville restaurant\/bar located at the Flamingo and it's one giant Parrothead party all weekend long.  

After we left Vegas 3 yrs ago, we make the annual pilgrimage back to Vegas for this weekend and stay here.  The rooms are cheap and not the best in town, but we are willing to trade off quality for the party atmosphere and not having to go back and forth to another hotel....it's fun!  Besides that, you can take the monorail from the Flamingo to the MGM Grand right at the Arena where he plays....easy access to the concert.

We can't wait to go back next year!

The rooms were standard hotel rooms with very basic amenities (i.e., only soap and shampoo were given). There is a safe and blow dryer in the room. No mini bar, stocked fridge, or bottle of water. 

The elevators are horrible. There are two sets of elevators and they are on opposite ends of the hotel. If you are staying in the Habitat Tower, you will need to walk across the casino with your luggage to get to your room. There are also stairs in the way so you have to pick up and carry your luggage from the hotel desk to the Habitat Tower.

I also found the taxi drop off very inconvenient. You have to walk up a huge flight of stairs with your luggage to get to the hotel check in desk. There was not concierge to help us when we arrived at 8pm on a Thursday night.

The restaurants and food court are nothing special and the animal habitat is a simple 10 minutes attraction.

The room was on the 4th floor and was very spacious. We were able to park our car on the 3rd level every time. That is also the level that leads right into the Casino.

The casino was ok. Table minimums were all $10 and up, but Roulette was $3 minimum. Drink service was pretty good in the casino with waitresses coming by frequently. 

Rooms were actually pretty spacious. Only bad thing about the rooms was that one day, no one came by to clean the room.

The room I stayed in had an incredibly comfortable bed, comfortable furniture, nice view...Our first day there the room was really hot, so I just called the front desk & they sent someone up to fix the AC- by the time we got back from dinner, the room was cool and perfect.  The bedclothes were a bit odd- two sheets with a blanket in between-- but not uncomfortable, just different.  Kept us plenty warm.

We had absolutely no problems with the staff, they were incredibly helpful in every way.  Every time I had questions or needed anything at all, they were very attentive.  

The Tropical Breeze Cafe- not the most gourmet cuisine, but for the price it's good quality food with a decent selection.  I'm vegan and my boyfriend loves seafood and we were both able to easily find something to eat and both enjoyed our meals.  The buffet was also good- Steve had clams, oysters...all kinds of stuff and loved it.

We got comped 3 nights and low rates fri\/sat (MGM wasnt so accomodating, the reason for the switch)

So FIRST update is there is the new annoying resort fee, despite their advertising rhetoric the last several years about 'no resort fee'.  Its $23\/day (incl tax).  Supposed to cover internet - BUT ONLY ONE DEVICE PER ROOM.  (@!%#@!!) Really?  You're supposed to be hip yet dont realize that 2 people are gonna have at least 3 devices?

After waiting in line to check in for 45 minutes at 11pm on a Weds night, we're informed we couldve gone to the secret unmarked line since we were casino guests.  Pardon me, no sign, say what?  The front desk person was polite, quick professional, but we got stuck in the veritable dungeon - room 5106, which faces a stucco facade with service ladders, piping, and loads of flotsam\/trash for our viewing pleasure. It was FABULOUS.  It was so dark we had to turn on the lights in the middle of the day.  ""well I guess this is how they treat casino guests, they really arent interested in real gamblers anymore"" was my thought.

Now we have been coming to the Flamingo since it was a Hilton back in the 90's.  We always liked the new pool (yes, I remember the old rectangular pool); Flamingo has made the big pool an adults only pool now (YAY), but they have crowded out a great deal of space for highprice cabanas, day beds and rental lounge chairs.  Leaving far too few chairs where the saving of chairs is an art form, with whole slews of them appearing occupied having been 'saved' by someone draping pool towels over them.  I LIKE the music and live DJ, but cmon, lets send someone around to pick up the trash, the pool was a disaster of empty buckets, beer cans and plastic cups near the end of the day.

Food - well theres a food court, quite overpriced, so I skipped it.  We learned a long time ago to avoid the Paradise buffet - it continues to set new lows for scary food.  We actually have enjoyed the coffee shop over the years - used to be called Lindys and now the Tropical Breeze, they have decent breakfasts and lunches (watch out for the overpriced drinks tho, just drink water).  I miss the old Flamingo Room!

Now lets talk about gaming.  Craps, theres little they can jigger with here - 3x4x5x odds, and a fun side bet called the fire bet.  Well dealt, but I got my butt handed to me this trip.
Blackjack - theres not much here.  A few tables, but most were the 6\/5 21 (an abomination of 3\/2 blackjack).  It was hard to spot where at the table this is announced, sometimes on the felt, sometimes on a cardboard tent, etc.  
The blackjack game I did find was out of 8deck shoe, had surrender (yay), DOA, DAS.  Not bad, once I found it.
Video Poker - Jacks or better sank to new lows - the entire property was 7\/5.  Now for the uninitated, thats the payoff on Fullhouse\/Flush hands.  The nice thing about video poker is that regulations state that machines mimicking a card game must be truly random 52 card deck.  They wont risk their license rigging this.  So the only thing they can jigger is the paytable.  9\/6 JoB is close to an even money game, and is much sought after.  Gradually, casinos have rigged these to 8\/6, then 8\/5 (which I consider to be my very bottom) and now must Harrahs properties are 7\/5 (Caesars, Linq, Harrahs, Flamingo, Cromwells, etc).  If the are stooping this low on machines where they have to honestly announce the payout, just imagine how bad the 'unannounced' slot machines are.
Like many strip casinos, roulette is the hideous Americaon 'double 0' wheel, with terrible house advantage, unlike the european wheel with a single 0 and 'en prison'.

So we get a '1 star' on the casino rating;  I wont be back here to play.

And another HUGE irritating change - PARKING.  OMG.  Flamingo has now dedicated almost half of its garage to valet parking.  ANOTHER third is now reserved for the Hilton Grand Vacations next door, which I assume must've lost its garage to make room for the new LINQ breezeway and the High Roller.  So now you're pretty much relegated to parking in the back lot - and this is a VERY long walk, it makes the walk from the MGM garage to that hotel seem short in comparison.

I will be delighted to see the Flamingo come back to its former glory - until i see the reviews perk up and the negative twitters fall, we wont be back.",4,0,0

We ate at Carlos's twice, nachos were awesome.

Our room 21025 was right next to elevator, which we could hear every ding and every person get off. This wasn't a problem until "" the radio incident""
The radio incident- we were listening to the in room radio it wasn't blaring but we were listening to it at a elevated level at about 5pm, yes 5pm. After about 10 minutes the room next to us begins to bang on the wall, we turn it down a little and then we get a call from the front desk saying there has been a complaint. We turn it down and then security is at the door, I open and ask yes can I help you. She stated that there was a complaint and she was there to investigate, I said ok was it loud to you and she said she could hear it from the hallway and that's too loud. I said I can hear the elevator ding, music from the pool, other people using the hair dryer in the hallway are those all too loud too. She asked if I wanted to change rooms and I asked what for ( she was very condescending in her demeanor). She said if they have another complaint the GSM would be up, I said ok I don't know what that is so be my guest. She basically said it was the hotel manager, I said ok and if you talk to him before that ask him why they put a radio in rooms in Vegas that are loud enough to be heard from the hallway. She said "" is there a problem"" like she was trying to provoke me, I said Yes and I just explained it to you and good evening. 
Tried to use the kiosk to check out 4\/6 were turned off and the other 2 would not allow anyone to check in or out. We just used the paper form, if they were working they could have reused our room as we left at 9pm.

-Valet lot was full. South parking lot was full. North parking lot required a hotel key to get into, but given the fact that it was taking 2 hours to even check in (to then be turned down despite having a guaranteed check in time) we had to have our driver drive around the strip and eventually park in a liquor store lot for an hour while we braved the line.

-There was no water in our room for hours.

-The check-in line, check-out line, and ""water complaints"" line were absurdly long. Since when is online\/TV check out not standard? 

-The security during the midnight rush were extremely rude and threatening for absolutely no reason (wearing a hood on a patio?) despite us being very cooperative.

First, the rooms have been renovated. I'm not sure what our room was called, but judging from the pictures it wasn't a Go Room. We had a desk, king size bed, vinyl floors, and a chaise lounge that faced their flamingo habitat.

Location is the next thing in their favor. You're pretty much in the middle of strip and it's a quick walk to the other big draw casinos like Bellagio and Planet Hollywood (hey, Britney!).

The resort fee is borderline ridiculous. It basically doubled our bill and covered wifi and a daily pass to the fitness center. You could only connect one device at a time to the wifi, so it wasn't as convenient as it could have been.

It takes forever coming and going from the area and parking is sometimes limited to ""hotel guests"" only so if you are driving and just want to come for an event or to play here, then you are out of luck!

I read so many bad reviews and was very leary about staying here. But I had a great time and will be staying here again.
To start off....if you like staying at the Wynn,Bellaigo,Aira ect....you wont be happy here. You expect too much for 70 dollars a night.
If you are looking for a decent place to stay ON the strip (no 20 minute walk from your room to the strip) this is the place to stay. I had a Go Lux with strip view room. Room was clean...bed's were very comfy. Tv in the bathroom mirror was pretty cool. Laying in both beds we could watch the Bellaigo fountains. Maid service was awesome,anything I asked for I got quickly. 

The casino had a great vibe. I was not a big winner but won enough to keep me above my daily spending budget. Drinks were brought much faster than other casinos I played in. I played at the Wynn for almost 2 hours and never saw a cocktail waitress.  I find it funny that the expensive hotels casinos barely  have anyone in there gambling..but hotels like Flamingo...Harrah's...Ballys have ALOT of people in there gambling.

As for the food. I did try the dinner buffet...SO not impressed. I had a better dinner at Circus Circus. I also ate at Ramsys Pub and Grill....Caesars new buffet and the oyster place at Harrahs which are all awesome.

As a hater of resort fees and spending more than I need to for a conveniently located place to occasionally sleep, I'm a fan of the Harrah's casinos in this area, but had never found the opportunity to stay here until now. 

We arrived shortly after 4pm to check in (because paying to check in early would have defeated the purpose of staying in a cheap hotel in the first place) and bypassed the line by using the express check in kiosks. Seriously, who are these suckaz not doing this? The line was gigantic, yet nobody was using these things. I mean, you guys know they're probably not going to give you a free upgrade on a Saturday, right? So within two minutes we were done with check in. It was beautiful. 

We quickly made our way to our room. I must say, these rooms are definitely a bit smaller than the ones at Bally's or Harrah's. The bathrooms were also a bit more cramped than those two and could have used a fresh coat of paint. We had no complaints about the beds, but there was something weird about the pillows. They were perhaps a bit too puffy. Not a dealbreaker, but you know. 

I dug the casino itself. It was much easier to get in and out than it is at Bally's or Harrah's (but still kind of a maze compared to my beloved but dearly departed Bill's Gamblin' Hall and Saloon. DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THAT TRAVESTY). I got copious amounts of free wine while winning money playing video poker, always a plus. The garden area is a nice escape from the usual casino-ness. The pool wasn't open this time around, but I've been there before and had a very good time. 

Overall, my stay here was quite pleasant. However, I'm giving it three stars because if given the choice between the Flamingo or Bally's or Harrah's, I would choose the latter two every time.",2,1,2

I was very satisfied with my room, I will get to in a minute why I only gave it 3stars.  Well first I stayed on a smoking floor, (25) and I was on the side with a view of Caesars palace. I stayed in a deluxe room. My room was very clean. I saw no sign of cockroaches or I would have check out immediately, The bathroom was clean.  If you want to nit pick the glasses had water spots on them but I didnt use them anyway, but i would have if i needed to.  I got a double bed room even though it was just me and I had booked for one queen, but who cares, the ice machine on my floor was not working but once again, who cares. i mention that because i am a no frills kind of person and some people are really nitpicky and want everything just so and things like these REALLY bother them, me....not so much.  I thought my view was awesome from 25. Standard tv, there was no flat screen, plasma deal going on but i didnt care. now onto why it only got 3 instead of 4 stars.

3 stars: I felt like the powers that be at the flamingo are just assholes about their late check out policy.  When i booked this room back in august i asked about late check out and was told to ask once i checked in. Ok cool no problem.  So I get there, check in and the man tells me i have to call in the morning to request that.  Ok I found this EXTREMELY RETARDED and annoying.  It seems to me that if anyone running this hotel had a speck of common sense, they would know that you are requesting late check out so you can sleep late and not have to worry about getting out of there at 11am, so why would I want to wake up to call downstairs and then go back sleep, everyone isnt like that. I for example am an insomniac and have NEVER been able to just go back to sleep like that. (it was a horrible experience for me and one of the reasons my trip was so horrible having to lug my stuff everywhere). so I get back to my room about 2am and call for a late check out and what is it...a freaking AUTOMATED MACHINE\/VOICE, saying sorry we have to late check outs today.  I happen to (thank God because i didnt want to be charged more) wake up at 9:30am and called again and got the same automated voice, couldnt get a live person to save my life so i gave up.

Overall, would i stay here again...probably not but here's why.  Everyone has to go where they are most comfortable, which is why I put in my review the parts about the spots on the glasses, the lack of flat screen because for some people THAT is whats important. For me, I need sleep, that is whats important, so I need to find a hotel that is more accommodating to late check out because THAT is whats important to me. but hell i had such a miserable time in Vegas, i will not be returning to that city for a while hopefully.

ps i was truly miserable in vegas so i was kind of sad to read someone's review saying the flamingo has a natural habitat for Flamingo's that is something i would have LOVED to see and i only saw the pool when i was walking to that wack monorail, it looked nice tho.

The Cons:
1.  The Hilton timeshare pimps are unrelentingly RUDE and bother you every chance they get on your way to and from your rooms.  SO NOT FUN!
2.  Our room, was just nasty.  Broken tile in the bathroom, brown splashes of what (??) on the floor under the counter in the bathroom, bathtub\/shower that does not drain, dirty shower curtains, toilet wobbles when you sit on it, broken fan in the bathroom.  Just gross all over.
3.  Everyone hates ""resort fees"" in Las Vegas but now you have to pay for parking (valet at least, which is new) on top of your resort fees.  If you don't pay for the valet parking, good luck finding a place to park in the parking structure.  So on top of your room rates, expect another $45 plus per day for resort fees and parking.
4.  In-room internet connection.  WEAK.  And if you want the upgraded connection for another $8 per day, it is still near dial-up speeds.

I booked through Expedia and as I had gotten considerable discounting of my room wasn't expecting much, but I got quite a lot. I arrived too early to check in, so I went for a walk in search of lunch (see my review for PF Changs). After returning, I stopped off at a bar\/corner mart called 'The Happiest Place on Earth' and picked up a 6 pack of Bud Light Platinum and headed up to my room. As I mentioned, I wasn't expecting much, but when I opened my room door I was greeted to the sight of two double beds and a spacious seating area with table. The view from the room was incredible and the windows were floor to ceiling. After a day of traveling and airports, a beer and this was just what the doctor ordered.

Turn down was reliable, regardless of if you ordered it or not. I made a mistake and booked to few nights instead of days (a hazard of using sites like Expedia) but the desk was courteous even as I asked why my room key would not work. 

I guess I violated the cardinal rule with this review of what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, but I'm sure they'll forgive me.

I stayed at the Flamingo for 2 nights recently for a business conference.  Immediately after I arrived into my room I had to use the bathroom.  Upon flushing, my toilet began flooding raw sewage (leaking from between the toilet and the floor) onto the bathroom floor .  I immediately called and reported what was happening, assuming that they would get me a new room.  They would not give me a new room saying a maintenance person had to come first.  It took them over 22 hours to come and fix the issue after I reminded them 3 times.  The leak came down to the wax gasket holding the toilet on the sewage pipe and the gasket had to be replaced.  

22 hours of me having raw sewage leaking onto the bathroom floor!  Unacceptable, and a health hazard at that.  I'm glad I did not bring my toddler and baby with me on this trip.  Never again will I stay at a hotel that let's you wait almost a day to repair a serious health hazard issue.  

In addition, I had wall hangers sticking out of my walls, but nothing hanging on them.  The bathroom cabinet was cracked and dry-rotted.   The air conditioner was dripping onto the floor creating a puddle.  The bathtub faucet was dripping constantly and loudly.  What a nightmare.  They really should demolish the Flamingo and start anew.",3,0,0

For the price & how old this place is the room wasn't too bad since we were in the tower right by the pool & valet but there's were the good in this hotel ends. That pool was absolutely freezing (I'll have a separate review for the ""go pool"" later) & the parking situation totally sucks, the only time we got to use the valet was when we got in Friday to check in, ever other day that weekend it was full (even for hotel guest) unless you were a diamond or platinum players card member. That tends to happen at most hotels in Vegas during the weekend so it wouldn't be a big deal except the regular parking garage sucks ass. There was pretty much no parking there, & most of the direction signs in the garage are old and faded\/hard to see. I ended up driving down the wrong direction like a jerk at least 3 times.

The wifi that's included in the resort fee is garbage, you're only allowed to connect one device which blows ass because even though my sprint phone said I had 5 bars on 4g my phone reception was non existent up in the room, they also tried to trick you into paying $10 when you sign into the wifi network even though it's included in the resort. My friend had to call the front desk when we were checking out to make sure they refunded him that fee.

Overall this place sucks to actually stay at, if you can book it for dirt cheap & don't plan on driving while you're staying here then it might be worth it.",7,3,2

Overall, the location and price were decent, but that was about it. We had a group of four and originally had booked a renovated room with two queens. They gave us an option at the counter to upgrade to a suite that was not renovated, but that was supposed still be clean and functional. We opted ""upgrading"" to the suite since we figured the extra space would be nice. 

They ONLY good thing about our suite was that we had extra space. However, it wasn't much of a suite. There were stains on the furniture, and in the bathroom, I found a pubic hair on one of the beds (and this was when we walked in...GROSS), and there was absolutely ZERO ventilation. Not only were there no windows that could be opened, there wasn't even a bathroom fan (isn't that required these days, especially if the bathroom doesn't have a window?). Additionally, the cord for the hair dryer in the bathroom literally started smoking after two uses. And let's not forget about the beds...we were supposed to get two queen beds, but ended up with full sized beds. Maybe they were considered queen sized when the place first opened, but these are definitely not queens by today's standards. Oh, and did I mention that we did not have a mini fridge, additional sink, or anything else that is normally standard in a SUITE? 

Aside from the room that clearly needed to be gutted and redone, room service was super pushy. Check-out is 11:00 AM at this place. It was 9:30 AM and we were in the process of getting everything packed up when we started hearing several SUPER loud knocks on the door. We opened it up and a housekeeping lady said she needed to come in and clean our room. We told her we weren't ready for her yet and to please come back later, as we just needed a little bit more time (again, check-out is at 11:00 AM) and you can refuse housekeeping if you want until you leave. She looked at us as if we were crazy or didn't totally understand what we were saying and closed the door. I'm not exaggerating when I say she began knocking frantically again in less than TWO minutes. When we opened the door to tell her to please come back LATER, she barged in with her cart and told us that she had to clean our room now because it was the last room of her shift and needed to leave. ARE YOU KIDDING ME???

I rate it 3 stars because it does what it is supposed to do...gives me somewhere to sleep. I also really like the casino here...I say here, because I am writing this review in my room, while paying 13 dollars for 24 hours worth of internet. That is not so bad, but I just think its stupid that hotel don't offer free wi-fi, they just want money so whatever. Anyways. 

I am here with my boyfriend and my grandparents. We have a Go room and my grandparents have a deluxe. First things first, we went to check-in with no wait because it was around 530 pm. The lines are very long earlier in the day. They give us our keys and we walk with my granparents to their room. They slide there key in the door and it opens....dot dot dot...to people in the room. Yes, they gave my grandparents a room that was already booked!! (LOCK YOUR DOORS WITH THE EXTRA LOCK) Thankfully they were just sitting on the bed, but imagine? So I was pissed. I let my grandpa go down and deal with it because I didn't want to start yelling, hah. Anyways, don't you think they should have gotten an upgrade? Nope, they actually got the exact same room but higher? I guess that is an upgrade...the desk girl said they were getting a better room. It was not better at all. So its good to know that they don't take care of their mistakes...you know what I am going to take away a star...now I'm mad again. 2 stars... 

Okay, our Go room is a really nice room. I was kind of pissed though because I had requested a room with a King bed and a separate tub\/shower. It is why we got the room, but they didn't have one. So we just have the stand up shower. ehh. Oh Yea, the air has been on the entire time but the temp still says 75 in here. Apparantly it goes off when you leave the room, so it pretty much only works when your in the room...Oh yeah, only one of our keys worked, so we had to go down to fix that. They also didn't clean our room the after the first night. I don't think they even walked in. So we had to call for clean towels. Then the next day we came in around 2 pm. they hadn't cleaned so we called just to make sure. 10 minutes later they were here to clean...

I just highly recommend paying for a nicer hotel. The food selection sucks. Honestly the only thing that is good is the bed. It is pretty comfortable. They Casino good. There aren't any good bars...

I mean if you just want a basic hotel, in the middle of the strip, it is a good hotel. Just don't expect anything extra. Expect to want to leave the hotel everyday, because there is nothing to do here...

I'm used to Vegas and know what to expect from hotels along the Strip.  I've stayed here three previous times, mostly because of its central location.

The Flamingo just went through an extensive remodel of their rooms.  Gone are the Carpetfresh-caked rugs of yesteryear and in their place, hardwood floors.  So we were looking forward to seeing what the old pink casino looked like.  

When we got to our room, we quickly figured out that we had an adjoining room.  From the conversation going on next door, we learned the the rodeo was in town and that our neighbors were about to throw down a few drinks before heading out.  We concluded that the 2 inch gap from the bottom of the door to the floor was not going to keep us from hearing cowboy boots later that night.  So we asked to be moved.  We had to come back downstairs to the front desk.  

We lugged our stuff downstairs, and got our new room keys.  Upon entering our new room, we were greeted by someone else's luggage, laptop and other pricey items.  Once again, we headed downstairs.  

So, on the third try, we got our room--with a view to the construction going on at the Imperial Palace (they work early in the morning).  I thought that after all of this, that we might at least get a small comp (hell I would have taken a coffee at that point).  Nah, we got a phone call for which we were charged.

Overall, the Flamingo has seen better years.  The glory days are over and for the price, there are better options available.  If your goal is just to crash after a long night and have a shower that works, then it will work fine for you.",0,0,0

Yes, this is old school Vegas that was updated about 10 years ago with their Go rooms.  I remember when they first updated the rooms. I think they comped us several trips to get us out there. If you have to stay there I would recommend a Go room.  I have stayed at the Flamingo about 10 times. This place is not as fancy and as glamorous as the newer hotels but I am sure they will one day run their course and be outdated as well. One of the main reasons I stay at Harrah's properties because of my rewards. They have great rewards and offer lots of comps for hotel rooms. I recommend partnering up with another player to maximize your points to reserve a room, someone like your significant other or a friend. Make sure to check in online when you get a notice. The line is much quicker and the entire process is easy. 

If you are not familiar with Vegas I recommend staying here because it is central to most of the strip\/tourist area. Very convenient to most places and the airport. The hotel is not that expensive but I have seen prices get a little high at times. Very close to tons of shops, restaurants, and bars that are more than willing to take your hard earned money. They don't call this city Lost Wages for nothing. 

The pool area is nice when compared to some of the other Harrah's properties, much nicer than harrah's and bally's. The adult pool is free to hotel guests of course and $10 for non-guests. The service at the pool is great. All of the servers are nice and super friendly. Drinks are very expensive of course and your stuff does get searched before you enter. Remember to hydrate properly because that desert heat is unforgiving. The shade starts to hit the pool about 4pm. You can always hide out in the grotto under the waterfall. 

I stayed in a Go mini-suite. Perfect size for me. Had a great view of the strip. There is a stereo system, fridge, flat screen, electronic curtains, couch, comfy bed, and great bathroom. I was with a big group of friends but I prefer to have my own room. It was a good place for us to hang and have some drinks before hitting the casino and town. Use the elevators by the Garden Bar near the buffet. The elevators there usually are not as crowded as the main hotel elevators. Make sure to charge stuff to your room, especially if you are getting comped. Always use your players card. Plenty of comped drinks while playing any of the table games, slots, and especially in the sportsbook. Come out and have a good time. Remember this is not a 5 star resort. It's a casino with a hotel on top. Lots of fun and good times involved whenever you can mix in the booze and gambling. See you this summer. Good luck!",17,3,7

The location couldn't get much better, and the price is lower than many other hotels on the strip.  My husband and I loved being able to go right into the Margaritaville restaurant, located in the hotel.  It has great atmosphere, food, drinks, and service.  It's just an all-around fun place. The wildlife habitat is really peaceful and we enjoyed the koi fish, flamingos, ducks, and parrots.  We also had a great view from our room and could see the beautiful pools below. 

So now for the bad points.  You know those beautiful pools I just mentioned?  They were completely closed, so all we could do was admire them from the 22nd floor.  It appeared to be one of the most spectacular pool areas in all of Vegas, and we saw many other hotel pools that were open and full of people, even though it was early November.  For example, the Mirage, Bellagio, and Caesars Palace pools were all open and busy.  If the weather is warm enough to sunbathe and swim, even if it's only for a few hours a day, the pool should be open.  That was really disappointing.  The outside of the hotel is under construction, which makes a really underwhelming first impression when you get there.  If we'd known the place was barely visible because of all the work being done, we wouldn't have stayed there in the first place.  Last, there are areas inside that could use some work.  The carpets in the hallways of the hotel were nasty and dirty.  The room was nice, but the overhead mirrors with light bulbs above the beds added a really cheesy touch.

I have read many reviews saying the check-in lines were terrible.  We didn't have  that problem and stepped right up with no wait.  However, I will mention that at times during our stay as we walked through the lobby we saw huge lines.  I have no idea how long the customers waited, but the lines looked like they could have taken awhile to get through.",0,0,0

There was still plenty of space to store our things for the 4 day stay. My only complaint is the thin walls. We could hear our neighbors, and we could hear when one of us went to the bathroom. We turned on the TV in the bathroom to avoid hearing each other's business.

The casino was nice. There were a few $10 minimum tables. It's connected to Margaritaville where there are $5 minimum tables. I preferred the slot machines at Flamingo more than Margaritaville's slot. Also the servers at Flamingo were attentive. 

The buffet was good. We got the Buffet of Buffets which gave us access to 7 different buffets during a 24 hour period. It was a great deal.

I know the floor is not wood but it looked like it and at least I could see if the floor was clean.  Also, the room smelled fresh everyday and I think that's because you don't have the typical old carpet smells.

Margaritaville is a part of this hotel\/casino so that increased the rating by one star.  I love me some Jimmy Buffett.  

Also, the bar called Sin City sells a very flavorful porter.  Very tasty and made me loose some money as I had to drink two ""free"" drinks.  So tasty.  

It is a simple hotel and and I enjoyed my stay here.",0,0,0

First of all the drain for out bathtub was broken so we were only able to take showers in our room. The maid service is horrible there are do not disturb signs but ours got stolen (this was a very common problem for a lot of people from what i heard) and the one day the maid came to our room they did a horrible job they spilled my water bottle and it landed inside the bag of skittles and it made all the skittles wet, soggy, and disgusting so we ended up having to throw away our bag of skittles (which was almost completely full) and the maid didn't even bother to clean up the mess they made when they spilt my drink everywhere. The elevator service is a joke when we were there there are 6 elevators in the hotel but when we were there only 2 of the elevators were working which led to extremely long wait times (up to 30 minutes) for the elevators literally no matter what time a day it was there was always an extremely long line for the elevators at the lobby floor it was so bad that almost every day we had to take the elevator up just to go down and because of the large amount of people waiting for the elevator when the elevator was going down it would stop at every single floor which made the elevator trip like 15 minutes one day after waiting for an elevator for nearly 20 minutes i decided to just walk down 18 flights of stairs just to get down to the lobby The staircase was absolutely disgusting it was dirty cigarettes all over the place parts of the wall missing and a horrible smell to say the least and then i had to wait another 20 minutes for my group to meet me at the lobby since they decided not to take the stairs. And the elevators that were working multiple of the buttons were not working and the whole elevator rocked and often got stuck for about 30 seconds The poll is also horrible the huge beautiful pool you have to be 21 to go into (which i don't see any reason for it) and if you're not 21 you have to use the ""family"" pool which is about 1\/5 of the size of the adult pool despite having five times as many people in it we didn't even stay in the pool for 20 minutes it was so crowded and unfun. overall a horrible hotel and would never return",2,2,2

The room itself was really cute with the vinyl headboards and pink stripe wallpaper, we had a nice view of the Bellagio fountains and got a pretty good discounted rate by booking directly on their site. The bathroom door was weird (it wouldn't stay open, it would just slowly creep closed no matter what) and you could kind of see through it but none of us were too bothered. No free wifi but that seems to be standard.  Always found parking in the garage and as people have said it's located pretty centrally.  The driveway is really stupid though- you have to drive between the Flamingo and Bill's Gamblin' Hall and there are tons of people walking between the two and you just have to plow ahead and hope the drunk people don't get themselves run over!  I asked at the front desk for a cot and they gave me kind of a weird answer- if you don't get one delivered in 5 minutes then it means we can't. Okay...well, we got one, it was apparently terribly uncomfortable, I think the little couch we had would have been much better to sleep on but no one would believe me!  The flamingo habitat was a little underwhelming, I think it might be under construction.  But overall I thought it was a perfectly nice place to stay and I liked that it has a little old-school Vegas flava versus some of the other strip hotels.

Also worth noting is the positive experience I had at one of the shops -Flamingo Apparel.  I way underpacked for my trip and didn't have anything the least bit flashy to wear but walking past this store and I saw amid all the sparkly older lady fashions (like Chico's but Bedazzled) this kinda gaudy but cute maxi dress on sale for $29.99 which was just what I needed! They actually had a whole rack of cute maxi dresses on sale and the saleslady was so extremely friendly and helpful I knew I needed to Yelp it! I was shocked that my deep discount dress purchase awarded me such excellent customer service!",1,1,1

I enjoyed the location, the hotel was in the middle of the strip, everything was in walking distance. If you plan to go to vegas, driving at night is a bad idea. The pool was very nice, but they had a charge fee for the weekends I believe, either that or it was because of a DJ party thing that happened on saturday while I was there. They gave me a discount since I am staying in the hotel, it was like $11. The pool, ALL of the poll was worth the $11 dollars. I believe there is a tiny section of the pool that is available for hotel guest without an extra charge. But all of the pool is necessary if you play on using it.

Now what I did not like was their check-in procedure. It seemed so out of order and disorganized. I have never been to vegas and experience a long line like that. They do have a machine ""express check-in\/check-out"" I was tempted to use it, but I like to talk to a human and have my questions answered and be aware of any promotions going on that a machine can't tell me. When we eventually go to the front desk and checked in, he warned us about an additional fee for the pool, he advised us about the going green promotion they had. Basically we don't get any maid service for our whole stay, but we get $20 credit for specific areas in the hotel, such as food, gift shop, etc. We took it thinking we would be fine.

When we got the room 8-100, our main light switch wasn't working. It was broken and I did not want to  go back down and wait in that long line. For our 3 nights we had only 1 roll of toilet paper, we had no microwave, no coffee maker, no mini fridge, which seemed shocking for how much we paid. To charge my phone next to me, you would think there would be a night stand to lay my phone on, nope, there was none, my phone was charging on the floor. The bathroom door looked old, it was chipped a lot on the bottom. It seemed small, not much breathing room.
Also heads up wifi is free for ONLY 2 devices, after that you have to pay the extra.

When we checked out, we used the express check-out because that line was ridiculous. Our parking was going to be $30 bucks, but when you enter the machine gives you a card, you have to hold onto the parking card the whole trip. When you leave, insert the parking card, and it will charge you. BUT if you had booked a room at the hotel, you use your room key to void the fee. We tried 3 machines, we tried the 2 room keys. We called for assistance. They ended up CHARGING us for the parking when it SHOULD have been F R E E with the room.

Gaming is rough - this is center strip... typically they are not as generous. Watch out for the one arm bandits. 

Hotel. The first time I had one of their ""Go"" rooms was back in 2007. They were all fancy and pink. A glass sliding door between bathroom and bedroom without lock - great for a couple but you probably wont have the most relaxing shower if your with some of your bros thinking they might bust in any moment with some prank... or perhaps video tape you while your in the shower and post of Facebook? No videos have surfaced yet thankfully that I know of. HORRIBLY LONG CHECK IN LINES 

The ""Go"" rooms have a small TV in the mirror but they must be looking kind of worn out after nearly 10 years. Ask for a strip view - usually my smile gets me a free small upgrade. Views are awesome, this is a tall hotel. It is huge and confusing and the hotel layout is a ""U"" shape so potentially if you take the wrong set of elevators you may have a 1\/4 mile walk in long boring hallways. You will find your room eventually though, they are all connected.

Food is ok at the buffet. Maybe even less than ok every time I've been... which has been many many times over the past 10 or 15 years. I usually come in here knowing it is nothing special merely do it out of convenience because I'm at the hotel. Drinking is fun at Margaritaville. A fun and well behaved crowd. You come here because you want to have a good time to to show off or brag about the fancy club you went to. Free drinks while playing are here and there. Some days you can never find a server other times they come around too often probably depending of staff that night.

Overall a solid choice. A-OK! Good value given the prime center strip location. Stay at this hotel and be sure to visit the pool and the birds and fish in the garden.",3,1,0

Hotel staff was very rude and unaccomidating. About 2 hours were spent discussing the situation with hotel staff.

We only spent a night here so I cant comment on the housekeeping services, but check in was nice and easy, no crazy walk from the parking lot to the front desk and to my delight the GO Room was every bit as fun as it looked in its pictures. Where hotels like the Venetian go out of their way to make your room a calm relaxing oasis that is sometimes hard to pry yourself out of, the Flamingo Go Rooms just make you want to party. The beds are big, fluffy and just begging to be jumped on, TVs are everywhere, even in your bathroom mirror, ipod docking stations, vinyl, mirrors........ There's a lot of cool stuff happening in these relatively inexpensive rooms, but the best thing they have going on is the shower. No tub, just one big glass shower, with all kinds of shoulder, neck and head sprays to make you feel all nice and squeaky clean, even after a night on the strip!

Swimming pool was extremely crowded.  They seemed to be catering to the spring-break crowd, even in summer.

I gotta say, I was pleasantly surprised.  Our room had been recently renovated, and BRAVO to the choice for laminate flooring:  Doesn't retain the smells of guests past like carpet does, and the coolness felt good on our feet after all the walking required on the strip.  The bed was very comfortable and the decor was fine.  Overall, I was pleased with our room.

Check-in itself wasn't bad, but we arrived at noon-ish on a Tuesday, so there wasn't a line.  Checking out was a little longer:  not bad, but couldn't they do in-room checkout or something?

The casino had a great variety of games - and I didn't find them inordinately tight, like you find in other Strip casinos. (looking at you, Caesar's and Mirage!) 

Drink service was fairly good - when it wasn't busy.  But, I have to cut the waitresses some slack:  When that place is busy, it's gotta be like herding cats to do that job.

The pool looked great - from our room:  You, apparently, have to get up at the butt crack of dawn to put down a towel to claim your place.  If you miss that deadline, you are pretty much screwed if you want to enjoy that gorgeous pool.

Overall, I can't say a bad thing about the place:  We enjoyed our stay, it met our expectations. (a place to shower and sleep and keep our stuff.  If you go to Vegas, how much time do you actually spend in your room?)  For it's price and location, you can't beat it!",1,0,0

The bathroom mirror has a TV, and the room has a pretty nice LCD TV. The shampoo and lotions smells pretty good. There's a lot of stuff as in furniture in the room, so it feels a bit cramped. 
The second night, we gave the girls the nice room and stayed on the 6th floor. It's a complete contrast. The pro is it felt larger because the bathroom was smaller, and no fridge, no couch, just 2 beds, and not even a LCD TV. It's just one of those old school normal TVs. Beds were decent, not as good as the nicer room. I'm not sure about the price, 8 people, 2 nights, 2 rooms... $76 per person. Not too bad.

I recently went out there the weekend of 8\/19\/2011 for my wedding and I was going crazy trying to plan a wedding in 3 months and to top it off somewhere I've never been to so I have to say I was really worried how everything was going to turn out being that it was our (my husbands & I) first time in Vegas and all the reviews I was reading really didn't help much. 

After all the going back and fort on where to stay we finally decide on the flamingo mainly because our kids liked the pictures of the pool and our lil guy wanted to see flamingos and it's in the middle of the strip. We had a few people staying there lucky us my grandfather booked us a suite as a wedding gift we stayed in the Go Room Deluxe I believe it was a little over $300.00 for the weekend. We were on the 22nd floor everyone else on 12th & 14th floors. 

Soon as we got to Vegas we had problems with check-ins had to wait hours in a long line just to get our rooms my sister paid an extra 40 bucks just to get an early check-in so my grandfather would be able to get some rest. They told us our room would be ready by 1pm we didn't get in our room until 4pm that's after a few times asking if it was ready and my sister finally specking with a manager. If you ever stay at the flamingo here's my warning. Check-ins are a pain in the ass ! 

The room was really nice we had a great view of the strip we could see the belligo water show which was really nice. the bathroom was cool had two sinks one with a tv in the mirror kids loved that when the came to chill (they stayed in a separate room with my mom) ;) and frosted glass shower doors with a king bed that was comfortable the room has a plasma tv on the wall and a ipod radio\/alarm clock. The walls are pink but it is the flamingo and we didn't have a problem with that as I read some reviews alot of people do. The only thing I had a problem with is the ac I think because of the big ass window and the sun beaming in it felt like the ac wasn't""t even on we had the curtain's closed thinking it would cool down the room but you had to be sitting still to feel a little cool. So other then the ac there was a few nicks here and there but there is alot of people who visit Vegas so I wouldn't""t expect everything to be perfect. 

The casino itself is nice I could do with out the smoke you walk out feeling like you smoked 100 packs and need a oxygen mask to breath this coming from a nonsmoker. The food inside and at the pool especially the pool is really good. The pool is amazing they have a kid pool with slides which my kids loved i swear they stayed in that pool allllll day.

Started off by paying the additional fee (I believe it was $30-50) to check into a standard room early- around 11 am. The regular check in time is 3 or 4 pm, and I didn't want to wait in the luggage check line for 30 minutes just to return a few hours later and repeat the whole check in process. Arrived at at room on the 5th floor that resembled a not-so-well taken care of Ramada or Holiday Inn (small windows, old gross linens, old fixtures, etc.). Ugh. Then my friend and I noticed the tub had a leak and slow drain- it was about a third full of water. Yuck. Called guest services... took approximately 3 tries to figure out the automated system and get directed to the right person. So that's the bad. On to the good.

Once I got someone the response was immediate. Not only did someone come to check out the issue less than 10 minutes later, but before even getting off the phone with me the front desk moved my friend and I to an upgraded room (a GO room) on the 21st floor. Yesssss. The difference in rooms was unbelievable. The upgraded room was maybe a little larger, but had huge floor to ceiling window views of the pool and preserve, a bathroom with a separate huge shower\/ tub and a tv in the mirror, cool linens, cool headboards, cool lighting, a mini-fridge, the list goes on. The point is, spend a few extra bucks if you're going to stay here- it makes a humongous difference in your experience. In addition, you get free wifi with your resort fee. You have to sign up as though you are paying, but the charge is removed from your bill before checkout. Overall, The Flamingo gets major respect for taking care of their customers, and being the most reasonably priced hotel on the strip right now.",1,0,0

The hotel is very conveniently located at the centre of the strip which made seeing the attractions as easy as it can be in Vegas. The check in process is a bit of an ordeal at busy times as so many people want to check in at the same time there can be long queues. 

The room itself (on the 14th floor) was clean and I liked that there was no carpet in the room which gave it a modern feel. The view was of the courtyard where the flamingos live instead of the strip which I didn't mind in hindsight.

The Flamingo casino is a bit tatty compared with those in the other hotels. There is a strange smell throughout where they struggle to suppress the scent of stale tobacco but as Caesars and the Bellagio are across the road this area can be avoided.",3,1,1

Long story short, after a long night, I was going to take a shower at 2:00AM.  When I went to open the water I get blasted in the face with high pressure. Not sure if it was the previous person who stayed there and ripped it on purposed or it was an accident?  Regardless, I let management know about the situation.  They didn't care and offered to refund my ""Resort Fee"" of $25.00.  Give me a break!  

So I couldn't shower, my clothes and everything around the bathroom got all wet because of the initial blast.  To make matters worst, these hotel rooms are so old they have doors that connect to another hotel room in case 2 families want to rent side by side.  The problem is the door towards the bottom is so high, I could hear my neighbor  snore the whole night!  I had to shove pillows and towels underneath the door.

There were plenty of minorly annoying aspects of staying at a major hotel in a big tourist city - the check-in lines are unbearably long, there was trash in the hallways (?), housekeeping forgot to clean our room one day. All that aside, I had an overall positive experience at the Flamingo. 

The staff seemed to do their best to alleviate some of the issues. A very friendly front desk staffer walked us through kiosk check-in so we could avoid the VERY long line & walked us to the front of the line to work with someone else when the kiosk malfunctioned a little bit. When I called to be sure our room would be cleaned the day after housekeeping passed us over, a very apologetic housekeeping staffer promised to tend to us the next morning & offered up a conversation with his manager if I wanted to take it up the chain (I didn't, but I appreciated his forthcomingness). And so on. Other staffers were absurdly friendly, too, in ways that made the whole stay a more positive experience overall, from the amiable bellhop to the fast-moving buffet server who kept us rolling in water refills & much-needed coffee to the gift shop worker who helped me pick out a clutch purse 20 minutes before my big event to the pool bartender who remembered up names (big ups to Rigo for treating our group so well!)

Other positives: The Flamingo has a few nice shops attached to the lobby, a spa with inexpensive quick massages, a Margaritaville, a party pool & a quiet pool, a few shows & attractions, a massive & comprehensive buffet, a brewery with a great outdoor patio, &, of course, a casino. It's in a great location on the strip, pretty close to everything, & from some of the rooms & hallway windows, you can see the famed Bellagio fountains! 

If you're looking for a swanky Vegas experience, the Flamingo may not be the hotel for you. But if you're looking for a positive experience in a hotel that seems to give a damn about its customers, even without big-time prices & fancy extras, then this hotel is a great choice. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks, Flamingo!",6,0,1

My stay started off as two reservations. I had a reservation for Sunday, then another one for Monday. When I checked in the clerk assured me that I would not have to check out and re-check back in on Monday. After I return from my all days meeting I found I could not get into my room. There are no telephones in the hallway to call so I had to go all the way back down to handle. The manager was very rude (Ryan) and told me that my room is being taken out of the system for work. I asked him for a higher room, I was on the 12th floor he proceeded to move me to the 10th floor. As I enter the room I was hit with cigarette smoke and was not able to stay there. I called down to Ryan and ask for another room and ask again for a high floor. He said no problem and that he would send a bellman up with the key. I was put on the 5th floor. I did not have cash on me so I asked the bellman for his name and told him I would find him tomorrow. He was very upset about this, flip his hand at me and walked out the door while I was still talking to him. No need to worry about that tip. This is not a clean or friendly hotel. The carpet was dirty and\/or stained. It really made me sick to look at it. My newly remodeled room had broken tile in bath, dried food on the furniture and the soft pillows were hard as a rock. If you think you are going to need cash bring it with you. The ATM charge a $5.99 fee. The food is not bad but $20 for a hamburger...not worth it. Not until the end of my stay did I find out about the $55 buffet that is good for 24 hours and you can eat at 4-5 different hotels. You can eat as much as you want as often as you want.

We stayed Wednesday to Sunday. 

Then the problems came up.

The thermostat wanted us to be at a cool 57 degrees. Even setting the temp at 80 degrees, it only became 60 degrees. 

The wallpaper started to slowly peel off the wall. By the time we left, it was hanging off the wall. 

The electrical sockets had to be reset every time I had to use it. 

Housekeeping kept unplugging my time clock. 

I could only access one side of the closet. One of the closet doors were taken off the rails and unmovable to place back. 

The phone did not work.

No microwave. I know it sounds minuscule but when you have leftovers from a super expensive posh restaurant, that is something you don't want to toss away.

Elevator moves slower than molasses in the dead of winter. Expect to wait for 10 plus minutes for one to arrive. 

Trying to find your room is a maze. The room signs are misleading. It'll point to one direction, only to lead you to a dead end or an exit. Definitely use the toilet before you play hide and seek with your room. 

We told the front desk repeatedly of our problems everyday of our stay. They told us that they will send an engineer to fix them. An engineer?!!?!! They never came. The best they could do for us, take off the resort fees.  

Hopefully this will all change for the better  if you decide to stay here. Give it a try but let your voice be heard when you come across any problems and concerns.

Checking in was fast, and we came in on a Friday evening. I wouldn't say instant, because no hotel offers that, but it went faster than expected.

I must say these rooms are a lot nicer than we expected and the prices weren't bad. The hotel was normally very clean and the bar downstairs by the strip enterance had great $1 beer(8oz) specials every night.

The buffet is average, nothing to blow you away, and the price is pretty spendy for what it offers. But if you are a diamond club member, you get to sit down by the windows next to the water, so the black swans will sometimes swim right up. On the weekend mornings the diamond club members also have a personal omelette chef.

The central outside area where they have all the birds is very beautiful. They had a lot of pretty bird and also some nice picture areas. 

Location is one of the best things about the Flamingo. We go to Vegas every year, and having a hotel right in the middle of the strip saves you a lot of money it taxis if you can just walk outside to fun.

That was definitely the phrase to describe our NYE experience at the Flamingo. I know mucho craziness during NYE in Vegas is expected, but it becomes an even bigger problem when hotel accommodations are screwed up.

First off...valet parking was full. After our 6 hour trek from LA to Vegas, the last thing we want to hear is...""Sorry you can't park here."" (Our first ""what the...."" moment.) Apparently valet was closed to us regular folk, but remained open for Diamond or Seven Star cardholders. To make matters worse, the regular hotel parking was CLOSED. We were forced to park at the neighboring O'Sheas parking lot. This then required us to haul our a$$es and baggage across an alleyway in 39 degree weather. ""What the...!?!?""

Secondly...when we check-in, we are told the room we reserved (the Go room with a King size bed) was no longer available, but they did have Go rooms available with either double beds, or a handicap accessible room with a King size bed. (""What the...!?!?) Handle bars in the bathroom was not my idea of a romantic NYE getaway...but then again, double beds was not either. However, we opted for the double beds.

Thirdly...the next morning I woke up looking forward to a nice long, HOT shower. I turn the shower on....water is ICE COLD. I figure it may take a while to warm up since the hotel is probably filled up to capacity, so I wait a few minutes. I check back...still ICE COLD. We call downstairs and apparently the hot water was out in half of the hotel. (""What the..!?!?) We go downstairs to put in our complaint....and the complaint line was already wrapped around the hotel lobby. We suck it up and wait in line. Its funny how negativity brings people together. Through different conversations we found out that some people had no hot water while others had NO WATER at all! 

After about 30 minutes, we finally got to speak to Andre, the guest services manager. Fortunately, he was very polite and listened carefully to our complaints...from the valet, to the hot water...even to the fact we had a coffee maker in our room, but no coffee! Step by step he negotiated a resolution to each complaint. He knocked off a hundred bucks on our NYE rate (our first night was already comped), he called down to valet and gave us his business card which allowed us access to valet parking, and then he contacted housekeeping to stock up our room with coffee (I'm a true coffee-holic.) 

If not for Andre, this would have been a one-star experience. Also, the Go Room was pretty chic. I loved the tv\/mirror in the bathroom and the pink and brown color combo. However, next visit I plan on staying away from the strip....",0,0,0

When I went into my room the stench of human waste hit me in the face like a wall. I called guest services and asked for a room change. She offered that she could send someone up with spray. But what good would spray do for that stench? 
Very disappointing for this treatment. I understand I had a comped room but is that the quality you are going to present your guests with regardless of a free room or not. The smell was unbearable and made everyone feel extremely disgusted. 
I asked for a room change and she denied and said I had to go all the way to the front desk and ask. When I finally got there the lady was very nice and actually upgraded to me to the spa tower. Room was nice view and ""updated"". The elevator corridor has 6 shafts. Day one only 3 worked. Day 2 only 2 work. And today day 3 only one elevator is working. Had to wait 10 minutes for an elevator. How ridiculous is that? 6 elevators and 1 works? They offered to walk to a different tower and walk all the way to the room but most likely you will get lost trying to find your room from 2 towers over.

If Siegel could see what this hotel has degraded to he would probably beg you to shoot him in the face again. Thank god we only had to stay here for one night.

Imagine a Super 8 or Motel 6 stacked twenty-eight times high with Donny and Marie's faces spray-painted on it. Now put the slowest elevators in the history of vertical transport inside the building and you'll start to get a clear picture of what this hotel is like. By slow, I mean it takes forever for an elevator to arrive. If I wasn't on the tenth floor I would have taken the stairs every time.

The current incarnation of The Flamingo isn't 70 years old but if you saw the interior of our room you would think it was. If someone had told me that the building hadn't been renovated in decades I would have believed it. The vanity in the bathroom looked as though someone had scraped a wood planer across the front of it. The paint was also peeling off the bathroom ceiling and a floor tile was loose. The room had no fridge or microwave either. The best part of the whole experience was the lack of free wifi in the hotel. We walked through every major hotel and resort on the strip and every single one offers free wifi. The only way you get wifi for free here is if you pay a $25 resort fee. So it's not really free is it?

The check-in process was a long, frustrating cattle call. It was like waiting to get on a ride at Disneyland. After spending 20 minutes in line we were ""greeted"" by a rude, abrupt, and indifferent clerk. She seemed like she was just ""putting in her obligatory time"" at the desk in hopes of getting an executive position.

There was no 'Do Not Disturb' sign in the room so needless to say, housekeeping tried to enter the next morning. I don't know why they tried to come in at half-past ten because check-out is at 11:00. Why doesn't the housekeeping staff wait until you've checked out? It just seemed like they were trying to get us out of there sooner.

This place is a dump. The Flamingo is riding on the coat tails of its former glory. Every other major hotel on the strip has it beat with superior amenities and service. We should have stayed in one of those. Lesson learned for next time.

The only professional service we got was from the bell desk staff when we checked our bags. Totally personable, prompt, and laid back.

Conrad Hilton and Bugsy Siegel are probably groaning in their graves with embarrassment over this place.",10,12,2

We usually stay here for the pool and normally I'm happy with this hotel.  However this time I am very upset.  I was in Vegas to get married and most of my guests booked rooms the Flamingo. My mom rented a Cabana in the family pool which cost her $500 plus alcohol.  What makes me angry is that the adult pool had a special DJ so they were charging $20 to get in.  Also because of this special guest DJ they blocked off the hot tubs and other parts of the family pool.  My mom wanted to get in the hot tub and was told no.  I'm sorry, but you did not tell us when we booked this cabana that we would not have full access to the pool and spa.  I think it's ridiculous that you would charge someone $500 and not tell them that they would have limited access.  You could have told us when we booked the cabana.  Instead you were happy to take our money and block us from the pool.  Nice.

Additionally, my groom booked a cabana on the adult side for the Friday before.  When my mom called to book her cabana they told her the adult cabana was also $500 for Friday.  I called two days later and was told the same thing.  When my groom called the next day to book the cabana they were like too bad so sad.  There are only 2 cabanas left so we just jacked the price up to $800.

My family and friends spent close to $10,000 between rooms, cabanas, food and drink at the Flamingo alone and that is how we get treated.

I originally booked a vacation package through Southwest Airlines for a 4 night stay in a FAB room with a round-trip flight. After reading reviews about how bad the FAB rooms were I decided I would upgrade to a renovated GO room when I arrived to check-in. I got to the hotel before 9am, check-in wasn't until 1pm unless you paid a $30 early check in. I waited about 15 minutes in line to speak to someone. I was very friendly with the women at the desk and explained I would like to upgrade, she told me I could for $30 a night and the early check in would be waived. I was more than happy to do this! I also opted out of housekeeping during my stay and received a credit for $30 for food and drink on my account to use at the hotel. The drawback is that there is a $34 daily resort fee and a $50 daily deposit (that gets returned at check out). So be prepared for extra expenses. I also received a room with a gorgeous strip view facing the bellagio fountain! Beautiful! My room was clean, except a small piece of popcorn in the closet. No big deal. I had a mini fridge and small coffee maker as well. Beds were comfortable and the air conditioner kept my room cold.

When my friend did arrive and check-in, everything was all screwed up.  First, they didn't have me registered in the system, which wasn't a big deal since they did have a room for 2 queen beds.  Then, they thought there were going to be 4 people in the room, but the reservations were only for two.  The good thing though, was that since it was for 2 people, they lowered the rate to $180 for the 4 nights, making our average less than $50\/night for the room.

He went into no detail, but then his colleague directed us with less than thrilling description, ""You can see that staircase over there...well, no you can't. Well, you can imagine...there are stairs over there...and you cross the bridge..."" rather than taking any time to exhibit courtesy to us as hotel guests. Obviously we want our young children swimming where it's appropriate, but what should be more obvious is that it's not obvious which pool is which if you haven't been here before - and more obvious even still, is that we should be treated with kindness and talked to with respect & consideration. The manager, who made minimal eye contact during my description of what occurred and explanation that my intent of making her aware was not to have my already cheap booking compensated, gave a halfhearted apology with a suggestion to have the manager over security call my room. Not sure why I would need to relay my message a third time to someone in order for it to get across to the young men security guards that they need to treat people with respect whether they're toting children or not? But that phone call never came either way. So they will likely be embarrassing other parents again in the near future, which I find an utter shame & disgraceful of Caesars Entertainment to condone or handle half-heartedly. Secondly, because of the mix-up in our HT booking, our room wasn't cleaned. Since I'm aware that the cleaning people are grossly underpaid, I made no stink - just exchanged towels and switched our garbages myself...which proved disturbing...as pictured, you'll notice that behind my garbage can in the bathroom - were clumps of hair from an emptied trimmer & neither me nor my husband had shaved yet today, let alone emptied hair trimmings. This is BY FAR the most disgusting excuse of a 'once over' in the bathroom that I have ever encountered in all of my hotel experiences. Not a hair, but piles of hair trimmings that had missed the garbage can and never been tidied up. We won't be staying a 3rd night regardless of our A\/C situation at home, this has been an abomination and a true tactless experience for my family.

I've never stayed at the Flamingo before. But my boyfriend and I are huge fans of the movie ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" and thought it would be fun to walk in and see the casino with a few of our friends. We went in, and as expected, everything was PINK! We walked around looking for a blackjack table and found an empty table for $10 a hand. Our dealer's name was James and I think he might have been Filipino, but we had the best gambling experience here! James was awesome and so much fun and all 4 of us walked away with over $100 in winnings!

Tips: our table dealt out of a card shoe, which in my opinion, makes the game of blackjack better when the dealer doesn't keep putting back the old cards into a shuffling machine. Instead, they play the entire show (6 decks) and when it is out, they hand shuffle all the cards and put them back in the shoe. Not only does this allow for an easier way to keep track of how many face cards and aces are dealt, but while the dealer is shuffling a new shoe, it allows for more time to be spent at the table with your friends and chatting with the dealer. The game we played was called Lucky Ladies which means that you also have a chance to bet a minimum of $1 that you'll get a total of 20 with your first 2 cards. Depending on how your cards are suited, you can win a few extra dollars that way too. It sounds like a stupid thing to bet on, but once you kind of get into it, it is a lot of fun to play! Drink service at this casino is also very good which helped all 4 of us have a good time while making money.

5 stars for our dealer James who made sure we had a good time and because we all won a lot of money!",0,0,0

Otherwise the place was pretty good but could use just a little bit better upkeep, though I think overall they manage pretty well.

Pros:
- Had a pretty spacious room for two, only stayed three nights so were traveling relatively light. King sized bed was nice.
- Great modern thermostatic A\/C system in the room with plenty of controls. Could adjust the climate in there to my liking pretty quickly.
- Great maid service -- they cleaned up the room well every day, kept the fresh towels coming, even understood a ""message"" I had left them: one of the two bathroom light bulbs was burnt out, so I took it out and left it on the counter and was pleasantly surprised when I returned later to find a new bulb!
- Great location -- right in the middle of everything.
- Cheaper than a lot of other places, though not the cheapest.
- Resort itself was pretty nice with the pool, spa, stores, etc. Built-in convenience store open 24\/7.

Cons:
- No free internet access. WTF.
- Carpet had some large weird ring stain on it, not sure what it was about.
- Only had two power outlets available to use, none by the bed. Was a little bit inconvenient considering we had a bunch of stuff to plug in.
- No fridge to keep left-overs or coffee maker for coffee or tea.
- Old CRT TV, though admittedly I didn't come here for TV and only watched some briefly one night to help fall asleep.
- Bathroom didn't have a usable tub, just a shower.
- The provided hand soap was AWFUL. It made my hands feel so dry! I work on cars as a hobby and I tell you my hands feel better after Fast Orange than with whatever that bar of soap was.. How about some liquid hand soap???
- Included breakfast would have been nice.
- Was promised a good coupon book as part of the itinerary and whole package we paid for but they said they ran out of them... No attempts were made to appease our disappointment and their breach of promise.

The Flamingo has a great location in the centre of the strip. There is currently some construction on one side as they have tore down O'Sheas and are working around the Imperial Palace however my room did not face this side so I don't know if the noise affects the guest rooms.
When we arrived the valet parking stated it was already full for the day and it was only about 1:30pm. We came by cab so I'm unsure whether or not there was a self parking option however it's something to keep in mind.
Upon check-in there was a massive lineup and we proceeded to ""Self Check In"" through their kiosks where we then discovered there was a line for all Total Rewards members (not just Platinum or whatever higher levels there are). This was something I haven't seen at other hotels so definitely bring your Total Rewards card and use this check-in\/check-out line. This would definitely be a drawback from the Platinum\/higher level members because they'll have to wait in line with the Gold-tier members.
We booked a GO room and my friend booked a FAB room. The GO room was completely renovated with a separate shower\/tub, TV in the bathroom, Denon sound system, large flat screen TV in the bedroom, motorized curtains, etc. The FAB room was renovated EXCEPT for the washroom. It had some sort of faux wood floors. The room was nice but we all agreed the GO room was better (and it was less than the FAB room).
The casino is nice, clean and lively at night, filled with mostly young people at night. The downside is that it is busy at night if you want to play table games or one of the popular slot machines.
We found little to no noise in our GO room at night and couldn't hear any of our neighbours. Our AC kept the room nice and cool and functioned great. The room service appears to come rather early in the morning (before 9:00am), however we put out the ""do not disturb"" tag and were left alone.

Overall I think the Flamingo is great value for the money. It's not a five star luxury resort and does not try to be, so don't book a room\/suite there and expect it to be like theHotel. I'm not sure I would go for a Deluxe room because the cost to get a GO room is only a little more and seeing some of the dated parts of the hotel I can only imagine how dated those rooms are. I would stay at the Flamingo again in a GO room because of it's location and price, however if you're looking for a more relaxing\/quiet experience in your vacation you might want to look towards a different casino with a more mature crowd. If you're expecting a 3 or 3.5 star hotel with a younger crowd and a lively atmosphere at night I'd definitely consider the Flamingo with one of their GO rooms.",0,0,0

We called Flamingo reservations, explained our plight, and they were so quick to help us. Through Total Rewards, they were able to move us quickly and not-at-all expensively (compared to the same room booked through another site.)

Somehow they knew how exhausted we were from our transportation issues, because a gentleman from the express check-in actually pulled us out of the middle of the line for expedited service. What a great surprise!

For starters, a good pool is important, and this hotel has a very good pool. It also has a man made faux beach and waterfalls. 
I also really enjoyed the fact that the Carnaval Court was right down the street, literally, so after a day at the pool, we could walk over and have some drinks outside, while listening to live music. It's also a very short walking distance to Caesars and Bellagio, so you can skip over there for some free entertainment then head back to your room to get ready for a What-happens-in-Vegas-stays-in-Vegas evening.
Basically, it's located in the middle of the strip so everything is just a short cab ride, monorail ride or walk away. 
The buffet was to par with any of the other hotels in the surrounding area, only a little less expensive.

We caught an early flight into Vegas, but had friends that were there the night before, so we were able to dump our bags and start enjoying the 112 degree heat (ugh).  I might add our friends had a standard room, and I was surprised....it wasn't too shabby!  Check in was at 4pm, but took my chances and went to the desk at 1pm.  No lines, and it was a breeze.  We also scored a free upgrade to a suite and I didn't even have to slip the lady cash$!  Very cool!  Our GO room (room 28000) was nice, large, clean and had a great view of the Bellagio fountains and the Effiel Tower at Paris.

Alas, I cannot...

The good-
- I did not encounter some of the negative attributes other reviewers have noted. 
My check-in was easy. Though the kiosk had trouble reading my i.d., I was assisted immeediately by a staffer- I think his name is Greg- and was checked in, without an early check-in fee, before 1PM. Check-out, with a live person, was just as seamless and quick.
- My room was clean.
-I had no problem whatsoever with the elevators. I used the elevators numerous times and never waited more than 1 minute, or so, for an elevator to arrive.
- The location is excellent. Lots of things to see\/do nearby.
-The Wildlife Habitat, and surrounding area, is beautiful.
-The casino houses the Donny and Marie Showroom. Credit must be given to a place that provides legendary entertainment.

The bad:
-As reported in other reviews, the bathtub ran constantly. Not a drip, but a continuous flow of water. Thankfully, I was able to overcome this obstacle by closing the bathroom door and setting the fan on ""high."" And the water never truly got hot. Depending on the time of the day, the shower ran either cold or lukewarm. This issue needs to be fixed and I deducted one star for this reason.
-No coffee machine in the room. Small coffee is $3.50 in the hotel. 
-My room had no real view. This really isn't Flamingo's fault as I booked the lowest tier room.

My friends stayed in another section of the hotel. Their room offered a great view of the Strip and beyond. And they did not have an issue with the water temperature.

I booked this trip paying ahead of time thinking it was all paid for and instead I was charged hundreds of dollars more, the dealers were rude and to top it off Sunday we were watching football in a lounge area and with about 10 mins left in the games everyone was watching they kicked us out and said they were using the space for their preferred guests. Really, they couldn't wait until the games were over and started it at 5pm? Just a bad overall experience;  I'm very disappointed and won't stay there again or ever recommend it.

Other than that I love the sports book especially because they have always accept parlays that I want .

This is the second time we stayed at the Flamingo hotel; the first was in the Fab deluxe room. First, I want to say that we got a room upgrade from GO deluxe room with king bed (high roller view) into GO mini suite out of nowhere.

At the first glance, the rooms (bedroom and living room) are clean. Decor was quite pink, so if you do not like pink, you should stay away from GO deluxe room at Flamingo. Bed was quite stylish and comfortable. Bathrooms (2 of them in the mini suite) are very clean. We did not have trouble adjusting the water temperature.

We were very pleased of the view we got. From our room, we can see the flamingo habitat as well as the high roller. At night, the high roller view was breathtaking (at least the first couple times you see it). 

Two things that prevent me from giving it a five-star:
1. We had trouble finding electrical outlet to charge our laptop and cell phones. I was finally able to find the outlet somewhere hidden beneath the table. Unfortunately, this lead me to discover a bigger disappointment (point #2)
2. The carpet at the bottom of that table was so sticky. Somebody must have spilled some drinks there and the custodian failed to notice it. 

Although the sticky carpet was a huge disappointment, we had a lot of fun in the room watching the high roller from our living room. Since the sticky carpet is kinda in a hidden place (I would've not encountered it if it was not because I was trying to find the electrical outlet), we did not even remember that it was there.

On the positive side, GO deluxe (room or the minisuite) has refrigerator, which allow us to buy beverages outside the hotel and chill them there. This was a huge plus for us since most hotel rooms do not include refrigerator. Also, Flamingo is located right at the middle of the Vegas strip. This is another huge plus for us.

Overall, it was a great experience, and I would not mind staying at Flamingo again the next time we visit Vegas.",4,0,0

Definitely nicer than ones like Hooters and Best Western (quite significantly so) but looks like doodoo compared to places like The Cosmopolitan (pretty expected).

Rooms were generally well furnished - we had the 2 queen bedroom.  It came with a 32"" lcd tv, a single seat couch, and a small table.  The floors were also laminated hardwood floors.  However, it did not come with a minifridge...

We were in the smokers' room and it smelled pretty terrible.  Like constant burnt marshmallow (the smell you get once you go beyond the toasty marshmallow aroma...not nice).  The smokers' room at Hooters was surprisingly odor free (although the place had burnt marks all over the carpet).  

The main problem I had with this place was the lack of soap and hygiene products left by the housekeeper.  They gave a small vial of shampoo (which didn't really lather...strange...), small bottle of lotion, a small bar of facial soap, and a small bar of body soap.  I don't mind sharing the vial of shampoo and lotion but if I opted to stay in a room with 2 separate beds, it is pretty reasonable to assume that I do not want to share the same bars of soap with whoever I am staying with.  Why would I wash my crotch with the same bar of soap my friend washed his crotch with and then proceeded to wash his face with afterwards?  That would almost be giving an indirect.....nevermind. 

The pool is quite nice with a waterfall and EDM music playing in the background.  The water temperature was also perfect and warm (probably from everyone's pee).  I will say that 90% of the men had moobs that were bigger than majority of the women there.  Their nipples looked like salami.....ew...sorry, too descriptive.",0,3,0

I don't need a lot out of a hotel. I don't go places to sit in a room and I think we only turned our TV on once this trip. So fancy TVs don't impress me and I don't need much more than a comfy, clean bed. Our room had no fridge, no coffee maker, no plasma TV, but it certainly was clean! Perfect!

I was super excited when we checked in on a Saturday afternoon.  We had valeted our car for free and the neither the valet nor check-in lines were very long. Crossing through the casino to get to the room elevators, we could see the garden area outside. Couldn't wait to check this place out!  I've been to LV a million times but never stayed here. Now, I don't know that I'd ever stay anywhere else.

The walk to our room from the elevator was pretty far. Surprisingly far, but walking is good for us and so I wasn't complaining.  Our room was on the 10th floor and had one lamp with a lightbulb out, a faulty shower with a slippery floor and a broken ice machine on that level. It had pink and black decorations and a very clean wood-like floor. I hate gross carpets so this caught my eye first. One night of sleep and we agreed the bed was comfy but the pillows were not. Bummer - I love lots of fluffy pillows.

The second day we stopped at customer service and asked for a room closer to the elevator. Lots of people had checked out (since it was Sunday). The lady at the counter hooked us up with a similar room but on the 21st floor, very close to the elevator and with a working ice machine outside. Everything about the room was great and it was very clean.

Good experiences with valet all week. Great experiences with the staff.  Even the cashiers were extra friendly; drink service was fast; and bartenders had heavy pours. Bugsy's Bar is one of our favorites. 

We sat at the pool in the mornings. The GO pool (21 and up) wasn't open yet but will be in a couple of weeks, so it was important to get there early to get a lounge chair in the sun. This was not a problem. I had been getting up early every day. There was a bar at the pool, and you could not bring your own drinks in here. They ID'ed and checked for alcohol. I did notice a couple flasks around though.

One of the best features of Flamingo is the location. It's on the strip and centrally located. It's not one of the newest hotels but has undergone nice rennovations. We walked lots of places, even though we had a rental car. The watershow at the Fountains of Bellagio are just across the street. Quad is recently rennovated and closeby and Bills is presently undergoing construction. Paris is near, but we really liked the open-ness of the casino rooms at Flamingo best. We went next door to Margaritaville a couple times, since they're connected by a fun bar and some machines we bet pennies on.

The outside area had waterfalls and fountains, big sitting rocks and wildlife that included turtles, fish, and real flamingos. It was all fantastic. There aren't many stores inside, but there are a few for shopping (even one just for adults with some fun stuff!) and only a few restaurants (I recommend dessert from the steakhouse). The Pizza Joint stayed open till 2am, but we were in bed before that every night. 

You have to pay for the fitness center, but 30 flights of stairs are available for free. Save your money and run on the strip for free. Make sure to do it early because it sure gets HOT in Vegas. Spend that saved money on a show. The X Burlesque show was in the Flamingo and very, very sexy. Make sure to search for cheaper tickets online, and ask for discounts at the Players Club desk. The Total Rewards card you get will save you money in restaurants at other casinos, as well as the Flamingo. We also received free tickets to comedy shows and the Auto Collection showcase from the Players desk.

Spent a wonderful 5 days there and I already can't wait for the next stay here. Couldn't have asked for a better room for less than $100 a night! (A lot less with the deal we found!)",7,1,5

Elevator buttons failed to work on several occasions. Numbers would not show on the elevator screen confusing folks.  Pressed floors would disappear completely causing the elevator occupants to go scrambling. 

The conference area thinks gaffer's tape is an acceptable carpet hold down as it was used in many places.l to fuse two pieces of carpet together.  And the temperature was sub-arctic. I was wearing a long sleeved shirt and a sweater and I was still cold. 

On our final night at the hotel our room was not cleaned. I called at 16h00 and was told they would do it. My wife called at 17h10 and they said they would do it. She then called at 18h30 and asked if they would instead simply bring us fresh towels. At 19h15 I finally went down and spoke to the hotel manager. Eventually they cleaned the room. And then threw in extra towels for good measure. 

Food was fair at best. My colleague visited the buffet for breakfast. When asked how it was he responded, ""like the hotel.""  This made another colleague laugh as she heartily agreed. This was her assessment too. 

We stayed in an updated room. The decor is pleasant and I appreciated the very large side table\/desks.

Water pressure was severely lacking in the shower. And I could never seem to get the water quite hot enough. But perhaps I have differing expectations about what is hot and what is enough pressure. 

Overall I would not stay here again if I had my choice. I typically choose to stay in the hotel where the conference is being hosted out of convenience. And this is the only way I would choose to return to the Flamingo Las Vegas.",0,0,0

We stayed at Bill's Gamblin' Hall next door and got free entrance to the Flamingo pool.  This is an awesome deal because Bill's is cheap and the Flamingo pool is a great place to party!

It is quite a walk from the front of the casino to the pool.  You are not going to make a quick 15 minute stop at this pool.  

There is a security check when you enter the pool.  You are not allowed to bring in your own food or beverages.  They do allow you to bring in bottles of water though... 

The pool is a party from the moment you enter.  Packed at all times, loud music playing, and even girls in hot pink bikinis dancing on islands in the middle of the pool.  The day we were there a local radio station was hosting the party.  We had a great time watching the limbo contest they hosted.  

The downside is that seating is at a premium!  If you arrive anytime after about 11am, you will have to stalk people leaving to find a seat.  Hint: Get your seats at the pool the second you wake up in the morning.  We put towels, a bottle of water, and a magazine on two chairs at 10am and then went and had lunch.  When we came back 2 hours later, all of our stuff was still there and we had seats for the afternoon.

My friends and I have stayed at the Flamingo for the last 2 years and are actually going again on May 2nd-4th of this year (2010). The Flamingo is right in the center of the strip and very many cool old-school casinos to which offer very inexpensive drinks. O'Sheas and I think its Casino Royale are fun places to gamble at and they are a mere 2 blocks from the Flamingo.  

The decor in the hotel rooms have been renovated. At least most of the rooms have been. They are funky-retro but classy modern. Flat panels everywhere even in their bathroom mirrors! 

Now we can talk about the pool......OMFG. Its such a nice pool! Really nice to just hangout or play volleyball and if you feel like, maybe head up to the top-less area if you want.

Both times I've stayed in the Fab Deluxe room and there's nothing really 'Fab' about it. Sure it's remodeled but it's just a basic room with two comfortable beds (I stayed in the Queen room both times), fake hardwood floors and a flat screen. The bathroom was NOT remodeled and looked like it's seen better days.

Both times I've stayed here, my keys stopped working....ummm that's not ok. Especially when I had to go downstairs and wait in a long line just to get a new one ughhhh.

The second time I've stayed here, we had some toilet issues and after about 2 hours someone finally looked at it (I could've fixed the toilet myself instead of waiting that long for a maintenance worker ha!)

A few days before my trip to Vegas, I came on Yelp to check out the recent reviews and got nervous considering how many reviews were complaining about getting a room where someone was already occupied in it.  A few stains based on wear and tear, I can live with (it is one of the oldest casinos on the Strip), but I really didn't want to walk in on strangers and have to deal with that awkwardness.

Alas, my trip came and went and all I have to say is THANK YOU FLAMINGO for giving me a good and cheap place to shower and sleep during a crazy drunken Vegas weekend.  No strangers to be found in my room, the stains on the carpet were minimal, the beds were comfortable and the shower was clean.  Plus, our view was not QUITE the strip as we were mostly facing Ballys but we had a great view of the Bellagio Fountain Show when it came on!

Location made it easy to get to almost anywhere without having to take a cab (except when it was late and cold) and when we got tired of getting robbed by the upscale casinos, we got to go back to our own casino and lose at a slower pace.

Cons: Despite their efforts to re-model, the parking garage is still dirty and old, the elevators too.  Speaking of the garage... way too small and not enough stalls and they directed guests to valet or park at Caesar's during the weekend.  I find this shocking for a hotel this size and on the Strip.  The check-in line is long 24\/7, there is never a time where a quick check-in is even possible.

We chose to stay at the Flamingo because we liked the idea of staying at the hotel & casino that has more history than any other in the city. Also, we wanted to have a great time but cost was definitely a factor & something we had to be somewhat conscious of while on this trip. We did some research on the more affordable options, including Circus Circus, the Stratosphere, etc. I am so grateful we chose the Flamingo. It is nicer than those mentioned above & several other older hotels. One of my favorite things about the Flamingo is the location. It is centered in the heart of the strip, next to Bally's, the Paris & Harrah's... across from the Bellagio, Caesar's Palace & the Mirage... not far from the Palazzo, the Venetian or anywhere else you could possibly want to go. 

Honestly, I thought the hotel was pretty nice. There are nicer, newer, flashier hotels on the strip, for sure, but the Flamingo is certainly nicer than your average hotel. I love the flamingo's, storks & other birds that guests can take a gander at. The pool was very nice also! It was very tropical & we thoroughly enjoyed our time by the poolside. The view from our room was nice too. It overlooked the Flamingo Habitat, the chapel where we were able to see several weddings taking place (from a distance, of course), and the pool. 

I hope they continue their renovations because, while the hotel isn't getting any younger, it still has the potential to be something great. However, nothing was a big enough issue to take away from our time there. I was also very appreciative of the little cafe right outside the elevators when morning would roll around! 


Our experience with the staff was only so so. We dealt with three front desk employees: one older gentleman had to assist us with our keys when one would not open the door & was very polite. The man who checked us into our room was alright. He definitely wasn't anything special in regards to customer service but I wouldn't call him ""rude."" He offered to ""upgrade"" us, which sounded all well & good at the time. The ""upgrade"" took us out of one of the remodeled rooms & put us in a ""suite"" that was very dated with old curtains & furniture. It was also the furthest room on the floor from the elevator... literally. I really did not mind our room, though. It was clean & nice but I feel like I was tricked into staying in a room that was not as nice as the room we booked. We also had an encounter with one woman who was incredibly rude. I wish I would remember what her name was because she is terrible at her job. 

Also, I know Donnie & Marie's gig is their big seller, but they have this enormous billboard promoting the show directly on top of one of the hotel's flashiest signs. It really takes away from the awe factor when the strip lights up. They would be smart to move it. 

One of my biggest complaints is the hotel imposed fee. I know people complain about them all the time & the hotels in Las Vegas just don't care. Its a ridiculous fee to begin with, but what's worse is, the internet in our room was a joke! It was so slow. Fortunately, we did not spend much time worried about the internet.

Overall, I had a wonderful experience at the hotel. They should have some staff meetings about customer service but other than that, I would recommend the Flamingo to people.",4,0,0

I was a little worried after some of the reviews I read but we decided to give this place a try. It was a lot nicer than expected. We had a normal king size room and we were more than happy with it. Check-in was super fast and the lady who helped us was very friendly. The room was very clean and we loved the big windows! The bed was a lot more comfy than I expected also. The Flamingo has a great variety of restaurants\/fast food. The casino was pretty good too. We seemed to stick to the video poker but they had a big variety of different machines. I will definitely consider staying here again.,1,0,0

Check in was a breeze.  There were tons of people standing in line at the front desk, so we went straight to the kiosks and were done in 5 minutes.  

We were surprisingly impressed by the accommodations.  The rooms were spacious, clean, and they smelled nice.  The decor was very simple, but went very well with the historic theme of the rest of the hotel and casino.  We booked our room off a discount website, so the horrible view of construction wasn't too surprising.  However, the construction was so much that we didn't know how to get into the hotel.  Some direction at booking confirmation would have been very helpful.

We had a really nice dinner at Center Cut Steakhouse.  We started off with the servers suggestion, the bacon tasting.  If you love bacon you will love this dish!  Beware if the spicy roasted jalapeño!! It's REALLY spicy! My only complaint was the seating pattern the hostess was keeping.  I used to be a server in a very similar place, so I understand how the rotation works and how much more convenient it is for the server to have their tables close together, but I find it tacky and lazy to cluster people together in the dining room when there are so many open tables.

We hit the roulette table next where my husband came up on $600!  It was a nice, comfortable vibe at the table.  Cocktail service was on point too.

The gardens were beautiful.  We loved the rich history all over the property.  This is where all the old time mobsters hung out.  We didn't get to enjoy the pool, but we got walk around it and grab a drink at the bar.

The location of the hotel on the strip was ideal.  We saw a guy sucking on a girls boob just outside the Flamingo's casino on Las Vegas blvd as we walked over to serendipity.",1,0,0

The pool is nice but don't think a day by the pool is going to save you money over staying on the casino floor.  There were 12 of us and we rented two daybeds, which requires at least $200 and bar tab in addition to the bed rental. Not a big deal but after an afternoon we racked up well over $600 for each bed and no one was drunk. A bucket with five tiny water bottles in it cost almost $40 to give you an idea of what I'm talking about. Meanwhile inside, everyone in our party had some kind of problem with their room. Four girls, including the Bride to be, had decided to rent a suite and share the space. Despite the fact that this was reserved months in advance, the front desk said they had no suites left and could only offer a room with two double beds instead. At a discounted rate. Which I'm sure was the standard rate for the room that they got. I'm pretty sure since the hotel was overbooked that they decided to give the suite to a guest they thought was more important. Someone else had a bathroom light burned out. This was requested to be fixed upon check-in but four days later it still has not been resolved. In my room, the space was really showing wear and tear. Parts had fallen off of various pieces of furniture and were not repaired, giving the overall sensation of being in a rundown hotel. There was so much dust on the dresser that I could write ""dust me"" in it. This went unnoticed by the maid service for two days, but the new shift on the third day took care of it. Someone else in our group had a fingernail on the floor and a water bottle from a previous guest sticking out from under the bed. The problem I have with all this is that the prices are not commensurate with this quality of lodging. It's not cheap to stay here! Basically I give the place two stars because it has a very desirable location in the middle of the strip and a nice pool. Don't think you're going to get a good deal for the experience you have though. It's overpriced and undermaintained. I don't see it changing.

I reserved a room at the Flamingo thru Expedia for Mon Nov 18th.  I arrived around 11pm in my car, and had 2 large suitcases with me.  I needed to valet my car and receive bell service for my luggage.  Well, I received neither since the valet parking lane was jammed with cars that appeared to be parked there permanently, and there was no valet in sight.  Hmmm.  No bell captain either, so I end up parking in the garage and lugging my stuff to the not-so-close reception desk. 

And there waiting for me was a really long check-in line.  I tried to avoid the line by using a kiosk to check in (nobody else was using them, btw) but it only offered ""non-smoking"" rooms.  This was unacceptable to me because I am a heavy smoker and offer no apologies for my personal habits.  (I also pay a zillion percent in tobacco and ""sin taxes"" too, so next time you see a smoker give him\/her a big ole smooch because YOUR taxes and cost of living would be higher without the zillions of dollars us smokers pay in taxes each year.  Remember that.)

Moving On: with no luck at the kiosk, I'm back in that dreadful looking line.  And it was every bit as painful as it looked.  Worse yet, there was a separate VIP line for next-in-line service for their VIP players, which made us poor wretches feel evern more miserable watching high-faluting people take cuts in front of us.  Simply stated, the line sucked out any joy and happiness from us new arrivers and made us all quite miserable.  After FORTY FIVE minutes of this pain and suffering, I finally make it to the desk, only to be informed that their entire tower which offers smoking rooms was being closed for renovation and they had NO smoking rooms available of any kind.   W-o-W.  Seriously?  I then advised the clerk that I needed either A). a smoking room or B). the manager because I was cancelling my reservation.  

Let's Be Fair Here;  the manager was calm, cool and collected and assured me that they were cancelling my reservation with a full refund for being unable to accommodate my needs.  My call to Expedia 10 minutes later confirmed that and I have since received a full refund.  So at least I didn't get jerked around on my refund. 

BUT I had a simply miserable experience at the Flamingo -- and worst of all, as I'm driving away it's midnight in Vegas and I didn't have a reservation anywhere (look out, Motel 6!).  Instead, I had an Expedia app which steered me towards the Gold Coast and my experiece at the GC was a complete 180 and they totally saved my night.  Feel free to read my review on that experience as well.  As for the Flamingo.....NEVER again.",1,0,0

To say that the Flamingo is dated is being kind.  There is no excuse for dirty and torn upholstered furniture .   We tried to sit outside the Sin City Brewing company (to enjoy a drink and escape the stench), but the furniture was badly stained and covered in bird droppings.

We may have been lucky, no queues at check in at all, and agreed to the $30 per night upgrade. That was our first win of the trip! Took a twin Go Deluxe room, loved having the fridge by the bed. View was sorta over to Caesar's, but hey, we weren't there to look out the window anyway, just check the weather in the mornings :-)
We found the Flamingo pleasant, clean, fun, bright. My only gripe was being charged $120!!!! For a blow dry in the salon. That's just pure insanity! 
We also rented a cabana on one day (over 40 degrees Celsius, glory be it was hot!) by the pool, and appreciated the towels, water, fruit, service, and safe. Having said that though, next time we'd probably just grab a daybed, and leave everything but the room key in our room, we spent so little time in the actual cabana!

My first time I stated at the Orleans Hotel & Casino (off strip) and the 2nd I stayed at Bally's. 

I'll cut to the chase, I DO NOT recommend staying at the Flamingo. I flew in with my wife the day after my birthday and arrived at about 9:30 am. After waiting for about 15 mins to check in I was told that I'd be charged a $33 early check in fee OR I could pay $30 extra per night to upgrade to the new ""GO"" room. I would have liked them to have waived the early check in fee because it was my birthday weekend however the young woman I checked in with acted as though she's never had a birthday. I paid the early check in fee and proceeded to my room. The room was small but clean and nice. I had a decent view of the wildlife habitat and the pools so I have no qualms about the room itself. 

Here's the BS
-Was charged a $200 incidentals fee without being advised at check in. I asked to speak to the supervisor and some Russian sounding fellow rudely explained to me that they ""we're not required to advise guests about the incidentals fee anymore.""
I promptly asked them to remove the hold and that was enough to seal the fact that I would never return. To me, that's shady business. 

-I called front desk for extra pillows to be brought up to my room every day I stayed there and no pillows were ever received. Go figure. 

-Cleaning women walking up and down the hallways at 8 am gossiping. ""Bitch this, Bitch that"". They didn't even have the courtesy to stop cursing even as my wife and I passed by them in the hall. My wife and I curse as well but not at our place of business and certainly not in the presence of customers. 

Long story short: At Bally's I got my ""on strip"" experience with a great room quality and awesome customer service. At the Orleans, I got great amenities, great value, awesome buffet and even though it was off strip the shuttle was so frequent and convenient that it hardly made a difference. 

Whether its your first time or not visiting Las Vegas, I'd avoid the Flamingo altogether. It's not so ""Fabulous"".",3,0,0

Three years later they appear on my bill.  Flamingo stuck me for $100 resort fees in addition to what I paid through travelocity.  Hypocritical and underhanded.  Especially since the buildings were once wrapped in banners that read ""We don't charge resort fees.""  They tricked me.  

Note as of August 28 it is on the newspapers list of restaurant establishments gives the buffet a failing grade:

The TV check-out didn't work, then the customer satisfaction survey didn't either (why I decided to give feedback here.)  almost every elevator was falling apart and room service didn't have three things I'd asked for from them menu.  Sportsbook is small.  I wanted a ""GO"" room  which is newly renovated.  I liked it even for the upgade fee of $25.  

The room-rate advertised on tracelocity was low but by the time we checked out the nightly rate was calculated at 198.50.

If you can get a room at the south strip hotels for less than that .. I would.  The south strip rooms are nicer (yes I've seen them all), the hotels are intact and the charges don't multiply themselves.

Reasons are: room, pool, beds, casino and charges explained below

Like most people one of the reasons I chose this place was the price although it's not so cheap after they add another $28\/night on for a resort fee and even that was expected since it was mentioned on Expedia but then to get here and be charged another $50\/night deposit?? Refundable or not, over kill if you ask me.

My second reason for choosing this hotel was for the Pool that was advertised since I would be coming here with my child and would probably be spending a lot of time there. I called two times before booking and was told twice the pool was heated....it is NOT
When we finally head to the pool we find out that the 15 acres of pools etc they advertise, 90% of it is blocked off for adults only and all that is left for families is this tiny pool that could hardly contain everybody. No hot tubs
And the water slides and waterfalls advertised are inoperable and I'm not meaning broken I'm saying they weren't even turned on and hadn't been since at least last season which was evident by the leaves and gunk that had accumulated. If I had known all of this I would have never booked at this hotel when there are so many amazing pools at other hotel locations on the strip. I feel ripped off and feel that if anything the ""resort fee"" should be refunded or not charged at all when your amenities are not fully available.

Now that I've been disappointed by the pool area let's move on to the room. Old, dated, rusted fixtures, small TV etc but even all of that is tolerable for a lesser price.
However the beds are awful, I woke up with my back hurting every morning and I don't even have back problems. Then when I go to take a shower the water pressure is almost non existent.
But the worst part was the ""a\/c"" which does NOT work. Whether I turn it up hoping to warm up the room or turn it down for a\/c the same thing happens the temperature doesn't change and it never turns off just runs constantly unless of course you shut it off completely. I have come to the conclusion that it is just the Fan blowing and there is no heating cooling system. I called the Front Desk who said they would send somebody and they never did. I am also starting to believe this is just how it is and how they cut costs. Definitely not somewhere you want to stay in the middle of the summer when it's 116 degrees outside.
The walls are very thin you can hear everybody in the halls all night long. And I have no idea what was going on above my room it sounded like a bowling alley which they don't have

Ok the Hotel itself. Good Location, shops, decent restaurants and a fitness center. 28 floors but the elevators are sketchy and feel like they are going to break so maybe this time around don't stay on a higher floor like I did Lol 
The casino is lacking and smells REALLY bad of cigarette smoke I'm sure because it's one of the older casinos. The newer ones don't seem to have that problem.

And last but not least the front desk staff could be a little more welcoming and less robotic like. My last stay in Vegas was 4 months ago at New York New York it was a little more money but my overall experience including check in was 100x better.
If it weren't for incurring cancellation charges I would have moved to a different hotel after the first day at the Flamingo.

So there you have it. I give the hotel 2 stars and that is mostly just for location

So you say to yourself yeah but I won't be spending much time in the room. Ok neither did I but just the sleeping part sucks with these beds and showering for the day isn't any better

So you say oh I just need a cheap place for one night on a business trip well you won't be very comfortable in these rooms for long not a place I see myself hanging out in for even an hour and I travel for business as well

So let's find some pro's because there's always at least one positive you can find if you try....
The Flamingo habitat with birds from South America is a nice touch.
The resort fee does include daily wifi for up to 2 devices and also includes use of the fitness center where some hotels charge extra for those items 
But not enough to warrant ever staying here again

Check out.....most hotels allow you to check out through the TV in your room. The Flamingo requires you to stand in the very long line at the registration desk to check out. Allow 30 minutes for this",4,1,0

The bathroom door would not close. It's a sliding door and when we would try to close it it would just go back. The bathroom light switch was cracked. We couldn't get any reception on this floor. All my calls dropped. The mirror had a black stain. Not sure what it was. There were marks on the wall and on the door. The room we stayed in looked a mess. I never experienced anything like this in my life. We stayed at the Flamingo twice prior to this stay. I'm extremely disappointed with the customer service. We complained to the manager, Frank, who did not seem to care. I felt like he just shrugged it off. All he did was went back in the back room with his employee for about ten seconds and then the employee came back and told us that we could not get another room and offered us a fifty dollar food and beverage credit. Really? We just complained to you guys about how our room is filthy and all you offer is a food and beverage credit. Mind you fifty dollars is not good enough since we stayed there for six days. That was a sorry excuse. I know that there were plenty of rooms available they just did not want to give us one. There are like twenty-eight floors and you mean to tell me not one room is available? I don't believe that one bit. This was my third and final stay at the Flamingo. I was in Vegas to celebrate my 21st and was very upset at how they treated us. Hell I even had pictures to prove how disgusting our room was. Frank did not seem to care at all. He has the nerve to call himself a manager...what a joke.

(stayed on the 22nd floor facing the strip). The elevators were haunted I think. Going downstairs, the elevator in the lobby tower would stop on the 11th floor almost every time. Other times, different lights would light up as the elevator was moving. Strange but kinda cool if you want to imagine that the mobsters are still haunting the place. Wasn't an inconvenience just strange. The Pool is Awesome, the Casino itself was so-so. I didn't see any big pay-outs so definitely on the tighter side but it is the Strip.

As the guy who booked and organized the stay for 4 guys in their older 20s, I think it was great! We booked through a booking website for $360 for 3 nights for a deluxe room. We were there for a bachelor party and did not plan on being in the room much other than sleeping.  (4th time to Las Vegas - 2nd for ""guys weekend"")

I arrived before the other three guys on a Friday night about 8:00-8:30. There were only 3 or 4 people in front of me in line.  I asked for any possible complimentary upgrades (based on a tip) but they told me nothing was available. We got a low level room that faced the pool area overlooking the Sin City Brewing Bar patio.  It was loud from the dj at this time, and I was a bit worried that it would be loud when we went to bed, but it was not - we went to bed late all three nights.  I don't think that going to bed early should be an issue for many people reading this. (Not sure how late the dj went - you may want to ask)   The view was great during daylight - overlooking the giant pool and all the palm trees.

I am not sure why so many people have complained about the mobile phone reception. I have Verizon and my phone worked just fine - no issues, anywhere in the hotel!

Pros:

-The window shade was great - it made the room very dark in the morning when the sun would have otherwise been shining bright into the room.
-Good air-conditioning (102 degree outside high temp during day)
The showers had hot water and good pressure, just a normal bath-tub style shower. 
-Beds were quite comfortable
-Great location the the strip - middle of everything
-Good on-site food.  Buffet was very good, and reasonably priced (~$16 with reward card). Food court was good for late night eats before bed.
-Staff was pleasant from Check-in to casino dealers to dining servers to maids - everyone was a pleasure to work with
-The pool reviews are why I booked here. We partied there for about 5 hours on Saturday. Cool pool. Read the reviews on the pool elsewhere. Not for people that do not like crowds. Definitlely a great place for social people - but you don't have to be. There was a line to get in so they can verify that you are a guest, but it moves pretty quick.

Cons: (very minor)

-No exaust fan in the bathroom.
-Pillows were awardly thick - a bit uncomfortable.
-no outside food or drink allowed into the pool, (drinks are not cheap, but reasonable for Las Vegas)

Tips:

-Get a rewards card - it's easy and free and you'll get discount on the buffet, shopping, etc.
-Bills Gambling Hall next door is a sweet ""dive-bar"" like atmosphere. Although they do not have $1 New Castle like some website comments have stated. I had $3 tall boys of Coors Light. Play beer-pong here.
-Very close liquor store - 2nd Stage casino on Flamingo Rd. (right out the back door of the hotel and a block away)
-Tip your servers - at the tables they came back before I could even finish a drink.
-Remember that this hotel is a casino hotel. There are cameras everywhere! Don't do anything stupid.",1,0,0

1. Pool - The main reason I stayed here is because of the pool party and once again it did not disappoint.  The pool is beautiful.  Get there early in the summer months because the chairs fill up quick.  Depending on the time of year you'll get a slightly different crowd.  Way more college students in the June-August time period.  There always seems to be a good mix of people here and the people watching is great.  The staff working the pool area has been great every time I've been there. 

2. Casino - its an old casino.  Other than the pink decorative cues here and there it pretty much looks like any of the other low-mid budget resorts on the strip.   It tends to be an older clientele.  If you want to go somewhere that feels less like a retirement home you're a short walk to nearly all of the newer casinos on the strip.

3. The food here sucks.  By far the worst is the Center Cut Steakhouse.  Pricing is on par with Mortons or Capital Grill.  I got the ""Center Cut"" NY Strip.  The cut of meat I got was extremely tough and overcooked.  The person I was with got a Filet and it was similarly bad.  For a ~$45 steak I'd expect a lot better.  Sides are ala carte.  We got a potato and vegetable based side and both seemed to be seasoned with a big pile of salt and their homemade popovers were so undercooked it was like eating bread dough.   

Carlos and Charlies wasn't good either.  The food court is mediocre even by foodcourt standards.   The buffet was ok but nothing spectacular.  I haven't eaten at the other restaurants in the resort but given they're track record at the ones I have eaten at I'd go somewhere else.  If you must eat here, get the buffet.

4. Rooms and Decor - The decor in the casino is fine for an old hotel.  The decor in the actual room areas is kind of junky especially in the tower that runs parallel to Imperial Palace.  The carpet in the hallway was filthy and the carpentry work on the hallway walls was pretty shoddy.  Empty pizza boxes and room service trays sat in the hall way for most of the day.  In the room, there is cheap faux hard wood floors and two of my electrical outlets did not work.  The suites look like they haven't been updated since the mid 80s. 

Overall despite the many negative comments, I'd still stay here again. The pool party makes it worth while (this effect is negated in the Nov-April months).  Plus for the price and the location so close to most of the newer resorts you can't beat it.  Afterall, you probably won't spend much time in your room anyway.",0,0,0

Luckily, my wife spotted a kiosk for computerized check in. No line, quick & simple. 3 choices of rooms. We took higher for better view. Got better view of construction & top of Imperial Palace. Want coffee? Mrs. Fields has it & a 15 minute line with a single employee. 
Room needs to be remodeled. The pink\/grey fur at the foot of the bed could have been leftovers from a cousins van, circa 1979. Spotty electrical in the room is making recharging of electronics difficult. Tough to take pictures with dead batteries. 
The adult pool was nice. Cool water & lots of hormones. It made for an amusing afternoon for these 40 somethings. The booty shaking contest was the highlight.

My free rooms are just for the standards. I'm not THAT big of a roller, but, I put in enough to get our bi-summer trips in. The rooms are good for sleeping and showering and other recreational activities that usually require a bed and a locked door. 

The best, BEST part about this hotel is the Pool. I made a concerted effort in the early part of this decade to stay at EVERY hotel in Vegas. I covered about  60% before I just gave up chasing every new hotel that popped up. I still have to say that the flamingo has the best pool around. The tropicality of it all is very inviting and soothing. We spend as much time as possible here. It gets crowded quickly in the summers. Get in before 10a. They have a waterfall here, a big one. Sitting underneath helps to get those kinks out of your neck. Awesome pool. Oh, and they have poolside blackjack. But, don't play. Unless you're really really drunk. 

I don't do very well with the gambling here. I tend to stay away for the most part. Luckily, because they're a Harrah's property, I can play most anywhere on the Strip. 

The buffet here is pretty good. We've caught all dining options (breakfast, lunch, dinner, brunch) and the food is about a 4 star. 

Love this hotel.",2,0,0

My 2 toddlers were so excited to go swimming at the Flamingo once we found out we couldn't swim at our hotel's pool. 
Once we entered the bird area that is on the way to thw pool we noticed an awfullllll smell. It Continued on and off as we walked to the pool. It smelled like moldy water mixed with death. After hanging at the pool we walked back to the flamingos, and noticed a huge koi fish belly up right in front of the beautiful birds. It was gross to see and pretty sad. 

I am giving 5 stars because I appreciate the Flamingo sharing their pool with the Linq. The pool itself was very family friendly. I would have much rather been at their day club pool though haha. The music that I heard through the trees that was coming from the day club sounded awesome. My pre-kid self would have really enjoyed it.",2,1,0

ROOM:
My Non-Smoking room smelt like smoke and weed was being pumped in through the vents.  The bathroom water pressure was intense, TOO intense.  You could barely fill a glass of water.  The paint was chips on all the woodwork.  There was no vent in the bathroom.  The bed was nice and there were nice big windows.

ELEVATORS & HALLWAYS:
The carpet in the hallway was like something you would find in a crappy Motel 6 in the middle of nowhere.  It was heavily stained and bumps ever 5 feet.  But the elevators were the WORST!  The main elevators between the casino and registration desk only were garbage.  One elevator was pitch black.  One shook the whole way up and down.  One kept moving after ""stopping"" at each floor.  A couple of them were missing floor buttons and half the buttons on one side didn't work.  One elevator said 2V at each floor.  Plus not to mention the stopping at floors where no one was there to get on.  Oh and forget waiting for the elevators over by the pool area.  Those never arrived and when they did, they were jammed packed.  The one time I used the stairs, I also got lost and ended up on the alley outside the hotel. 

POOL:
I will never stay at this hotel again.  The ""best"" part of the hotel is supposedly the GO Pool.  WRONG!! WORST MONEY SCHEME EVER!!!  First the line to get in to the Go pool was easily 50 feet long all day.  That was just to check IDs and look inside bags.  Then they wouldn't let you bring in any outside food, drinks and even cups\/bottles\/container.  That includes the fancy Flamingo glasses you buy inside the Go Pool.  One piece of advice, DO NOT BUY A FLAMINGO CUP unless you only want it as a souvenir.  They will not let you bring them back into the pool.  They will not let you refill it at the pool.  You can buy another drink and pour it into your Flamingo cup but it's still $16-23 for a blended drink.  Plus good luck filling a chair, bench or spot to sit.  Get there at 8:30am in order to get a chance at a spot.  My advice, go to the Family pool or the kiddie pool.  The Slide was fun!

PARKING:
Parking was horrendous!  The park spot lines were invisible, so one car was diagonal and the next was straight in.  There were only 5 levels of parking and some of those were reserved for the Hertz rental cars.

I felt sorry for the poor people that had to wait in the 10 mile long line to check in.  I was able to check in online and my line still took over 45 mins to check in through.  

One nice benefit to the Flamingo is that it has a montrail stop near it....near is being nice.  The hotel is centrally located and Margaritaville is inside it.  But with the amount of money I spent, I sure hope they use all of it to fix up the place.  Luckily it's in Vegas because if it wasn't, it would be shut down in a hurry.",0,1,0

I would have given this place a 4 or 5 for sure back then, but I went back and stayed here the last time I visited Las Vegas (this time with my SO) and we did not have as much of a pleasant experience.  
The hotel looked the same and was pretty nice, though a little old in some areas (many Vegas hotels look like this though) but the thing that got to me was the people at the reservations desk.  We had reserved our hotel room for two nights weeks in advance and when we got there they tried to get us to move our hotel room to the Imperial Palace (no offense, that place is sort of a crap hole).  WHAT?  We had reserved rooms at the FLAMINGO and they tried to get us to move our room to the Imperial Palace, a completely different hotel?  The messed up thing about the whole thing was that the people before us in the reservations line didn't even have reservations for the flamingo and they went up and asked if they could stay there and switch from another hotel and they were given a room at the flamingo!  We had reserved weeks in advance and they tried to move us over to another, crappier, hotel!  Uh, hell no.  We got our room at the Flamingo that we had reserved in the end, but were met with rudeness, as if it was expected of us to move to another hotel.   We would not have booked at the Flamingo in the first place if we had known that we would be met with such rudeness.  We had to stay at the reservation desk for 20 minutes.  The woman behind the counter said she would be right back but didn't come back for 20 minutes.  We stoood around, waiting, while others were being served.  And I had to go up and practically yell at another of the clerks behind the counter that we had been left there waiting for 20 minutes.  She didn't come back for another 10 minutes after that and they all looked at us as if we were crazy for being pissed off for being left there at the counter for nearly half an hour.... Uh... what?  They were extremely rude, said they had overbooked the hotel, etc... Well, that's not my problem that they were overbooked that night.  They should first make sure all the people who had PREVIOUSLY made RESERVATIONS got their rooms before they gave rooms to walk-ins!  DUH.  How hard is it for them to understand that? ... 

In the end we got our room, but that was extremely annoying.  The room was pretty nice, but they gave us a really crappy view (of the parking lot).  

The pool was ok, though it was super crowded and was way more like a club.  We ended up just chilling at the family pool for a bit because that was a lot quieter and more chill.  The regular pool was really too club-like - loud music, annoying people, etc.  
And we're in our early 20's and generally like going out, but this was way too much for us. 
I used to love the pool here.  I think they have the nicest pool here, in terms of layout. There are a bunch of slides and there are several different pools and a waterfall too, which I haven't seen at any other Vegas hotel pool.  It's usually really, really nice, but it was just way too crowded and ""clubby"" for me this time.

Anyway, in all I don't think I would stay at the Flamingo again. The experience at the reservation desk alone was enough for me to not stay there again.  You can stay at a lot of comparable or nicer hotels - Monte Carlo, Ballys, Treasure Island -  for a lot less of a hassle, I'm sure.",1,1,0

I stayed in a suite with some friends and the room was overall comfortable (although the pull out bed was old and very uncomfortable), clean, and spacious. The best part of the Flamingo is its location. It is across the street from Caesar's Palace, and right next to LINQ and its stores and restaurants. The check in process was very simple and quick using the automated check in booths. The casino area is fairly small, but that didn't bother me much since I don't gamble.

Here's my big beef, it's not like I was even that upset to begin with. Although most people would probably be very upset, I called in being completely understanding to the fact that the last person could have brought it to Flamingo. At first I wasn't even looking for a refund, but seriously, after all the calls and complaints not only did they not offer a refund, they didn't even offer a discount to give me a better experience next time or anything. You would think they would at least go out of their way to show their customers they are sorry and try to win my business back, no, they were content to just write me off. What I am upset with is the lack of customer service that was provided. 

Details:
I checked in Friday and by Sunday after checking out I noticed spots on my feet. I didn't think much of it but by Sunday night it started to itch. Monday is when they started to really itch and by Tuesday my toes and more were showing multiple bites. 

Info on bug bites:
Look it up, my doctor confirmed with me as well that bed bug bites take a few days to show, IF AT ALL. Depending on sensitivity to the skin and other factors, some people never show signs they have been bit. I have a very sensitive reaction to bug bites and this was no different. 

What happened when I called to inform Flamingo:
1) upon calling in was told we would need a doctors note to even proceed!
2) after complaining of the customer service I was transferred again to security to which the security replied ""there are people in there now and they aren't complaining"". So, are you telling me I am a liar? Who does this? 
3) Going through hoops I finally filed a complaint and was told I would receive a call within a day or two from risk management... never received a call. 
4) I went to the doctors on Thursday and received my doctors note about the bites. I called to forward these documents they requested only to be told they need to do their own investigation and will respond within 24-48 hours. It has been 5 days... no call.

I have stayed at MULTIPLE HOTELS, I am literally a gold star member with hotels.com and currently have 30 pending hotel bookings with them from now through to August. I have never had such terrible customer service, lack of empathy, lack of care,... just the worst. I think it's absolutely funny that Caesar's palace is part of this crap establishment. 

Bottom line: I will go ahead and keep booking with Cosmopolitan, Wynn, The Signature, and the rest of these people who have gone above and beyond to not only keep my business, but ensure that I am satisfied with their establishment. A place like this is a type of place that doesn't care about their customers and only wants your money, once you're out they don't care about you or your health or experience with their company as they already have your money.",15,2,1

I am a Vegas connoisseur. I go to Vegas twice a month, pretty much every other weekend, just because I can.

My friend's birthday was a couple weekends ago, and we decided to stay here. Now, I've stayed here two other times, and just to make sure I hated it, we stayed there one more time since the rate for that specific weekend was cheap.

We arrived at 1am in the morning thinking that the later we leave the better. BAD IDEA!!! the past three times I've been here the valet has been full every single time. How is that good customer service at all? 

We walked up to the front desk thinking our check in would be fairly quick and painless. NOPE. Waited 1 hour to check in. Our reservation was for a two queen bed regular standard run-of-the-mill smoking room. I had booked our reservation about 2 months before hand to make sure that we would get the rate we wanted and the room we wanted. On our confirmation sheet it said: ""two queen standard room smoking."" When I finally crawled up to the front desk, they told me that they had first of all, no smoking rooms available, and no queen bed rooms available. I was ppppiiiiiissssseeeeeedddd. I explained calmly that I had made these reservations in advance through my credit card company and I demanded we got what we ordered. I showed her the confirmation sheet and she just said ""I'm sorry but it's subject to availability.""
OK. FINE. We'll take the damn King size bed with no smoking room.

We get to our room, after walking what literally felt like a mile, and threw our bags down. We tried to turn the air on, because when we were there it was 1am in the morning but still 100 degrees. The air conditioning didn't work. GAHHHHHH.

We called down to the front desk and told them, politely, that we wouldn't stand for this both nights. The manager was nice enough to give us a mini-suite, but for the next night. OK, we'll take it.

We wake up the next morning, pack up our stuff, and move our stuff to the mini-suite. The mini-suite was better, but not much. Everything seemed like it was from extended stay (i've stayed at some nicer extended stays than the Flamingo!). Nothing was durable. The table broke when we put our room service on it.

Speaking of room service, we didn't have a book in our room for any kind of room service, so we called down, got fed up because we waited 30 minutes for it, ordered our food because we were hungry, the room service came, we ate, took a nap AND THEN the menu came!!!! over a three our time frame!!!! oh boy.

We tried to go to the pool, and since we had a little bit of the brown bag flu, we had to get some alcoholic beverages. We paid 8 dollars for each, brought them and stood in line for about 30 minutes. They wouldn't even let us bring the drinks inside!

My point is, DO NOT waste your time, take my advice, stay somewhere else, even if you have to pay a little extra.
If you have any questions feel free to ask.

Our experience with early check-in epitomizes our customer service experience at the Flamingo. The website says that they cannot promise early check-in, but when we arrived at 8am from the airport, we were told that the room we booked was vacant and just needed to be cleaned, so we should come back in half an hour to an hour. We come back about an hour later, and are told that we need to come back in another half an hour to an hour. Finally, we go back another hour later and are told the same thing. It takes until past noon for us to check in. I wouldn't have minded if they had just told us up-front that we wouldn't be able to check in until later, because then we would have checked our bags and gone to explore Vegas, but by continually pushing us off for short periods, we were not able to leave the hotel and just had to wait for them to figure their shit out for hours.

Customer service disasters (sadly, there were others) aside, I will say that the Flamingo is very convenient. Right across the street from Caesar's Palace, etc. We also liked how many cabs, party buses, etc, were easy to access from the hotel. Other amenities? Huge casino, multiple Mexican restaurants, a sushi restaurant, a food court, a convenience store.

I really had my heart on staying at the Encore, however, it would have made for a pretty long walk at 8AM every morning, and I figured he could enjoy his time a little bit more given he could literally roll out of bed and go downstairs to his class (I know, I'm a great wife ; ).  Also, it would have been about a grand to stay at the Encore and the Flamingo was paid by the govt...so this put us over the edge to just suck it up and stay at the Flamingo.

We stayed on a upper floor in a go room, which wasn't too bad!  I will give the room 3 stars for view (overlooking pool), cleanliness, and it seemed relatively quiet.  The shower is also pretty nice!  But they sure did waste a lot of space putting in a tiny tub that no one would use.  

I give the Flamingo as a whole 2 stars because it just wasn't our scene, especially in the evenings!  We typically enjoy going out and then coming back to our hotel and having the option to gamble before crashing for the night, and we just didn't do that here.  Also, their restaurant choices are not too great, and is it too much to ask for a Starbucks???

On the other hand, the pool is really nice and it is funny to watch the line start up at about 8AM every morning (I even waited in line one morning in fear that I wouldn't get a chair, haha)!   Just an FYI, for all those that have questions\/concerns about their pool....YES, it does get very crowded!  They advertise that they don't open till 9AM, but I saw them letting people in as early as 8AM.  If there is just a couple of you, you will have no problem getting a decent chair as long as you are there before about 11AM M-TH.  However, if you go Fri.-Sat. you will probably need to be there by about 10AM to ensure you get chairs together, because it really does get crowded.  And if you aren't an early morning person, then I would wait till about 12-1 to go because by then people start leaving and you can usually snatch their chairs as they are leaving.

Flamingo makes for an okay stay...it just didn't do it for me (maybe I was asking for too much).  If I could do it all over again I think we would have chosen to pay for another casino because it would have made for a better overall stay...but that's just me!",1,1,1

I want to stress that the staff is wonderful - no matter what problems I've encountered, every single person has tried their best to alleviate them.   One night I actually had to change rooms three different times, but didn't get angry because they were so nice, and of course upgraded me each time at no cost.  I've even gotten free suites and a limo ride home from a pit boss.  

The location is great if you like the Strip, as you can walk to everything and get that ""bustle"" that belongs only to Vegas.

Good variety of machines and table games.  Very nice coffee-shop type restaurant is my choice for most meals, although of course there's the ubiquitous buffet available as well as fast food.  There's a row of shops, and Donny and Marie were the staple entertainers at my last visit.

So what's my problem?   It's the rooms.  There always seems to be something wrong.  Even if all seems well, the all-glass bathroom is not for the modest, and if one person gets up before the other who would like to remain sleeping, having the bright lights through all that glass makes it very difficult.

The upgraded rooms have a fabulous king bed with the most luxurious mattress I've ever slept upon, a bath and a half (the ""half"" is off the sitting room, which is really nice for guests), and a TV in the mirror (although mine didn't work).  They also provide hair dryers in both baths!  However, my shower barely functioned and the toilet ran incessantly, so that wasn't much fun.  

If they could just get the room issues solved, this would be 5 stars in my book.  It may not be possible, considering the age of the place, and goodness knows they've spent a lot on renovations over the last few years.  As long as the customer service is so good, though, I'll put up with the problems and continue to patronize the Flamingo.",3,0,0

Something happened with our reservation, but they were still able to get us a room. The guy tells us he is going to upgrade us to a jr suite. Thinking this is a good thing, I get excited. Anyway, we walk into the room and it's totally outdated. The hotel had recently done a lot of renovations, and those rooms are great. It's just super annoying that they still rent out the crap ones like ours-- stained carpet, mold on the carpet in the corners, broken fixtures, mold on the shower curtain, dirty tiling in the bathroom. The bedroom section had such a low ceiling that my sister, who is 5'2, could touch the ceiling. We crawl into bed at night and realize there are no plugs on the nightstand to charge our phones-- so the phones have to be plugged into the wall across the room and just lay on the floor.

Parking is horrendous. Half the garage is of limits because it provides parking to a surrounding property and to Hertz. I wanted to valet since I was with someone who has joint problems, but they were full every single night. Finally I just gave up and started parking in a lot a way down the road. 

Another thing that bothered me is that the room service only goes until 1pm. I was looking forward to being in my pjs the night we arrived and watching tv, but there were no options. I get that there are other food places nearby, but im would have paid a pretty penny for someone to deliver it to me. 

The saving grace for this trip was the spa, which I will write a separate review about. It's only $10 to enter for the day for guests of the hotel, and it's totally worth it. 

I will stay again so long as they guarantee me a refurbished room.",3,0,0

* Walls are as thin as that paper football players break thru
* Every room has adjoining doors that are not insulated and a 5"" gap on bottom
* As of 6\/24\/12 there is construction on NORTH side of hotel, they're demo'ing a 
    parking structure and lots of noise from 6am-4:30pm, loud!..loud! loud!
* If u want peace and quiet in your room, you won't get it, Flamingo is a frat house
* Security is actually ""The polite police""..if a party happens next door @ 2am and you
    can't sleep, the polite police come up and ask them nicely to stop partying, then fist 
    bump the party goer's as they leave...no matter how many times they show up.
* Valet is always ""FULL"" even when they are not. Parking is a bitch in the structure.
* YES! Rooms are redone and that's it. Hallways still have the 1957 carpet and 
    wallpaper. The Flamingo is like 5 hotels in one, Identity crisis.
* If anyone from the hotel asks you ""HOW LONG ARE YOU STAYING?"" or ""ARE YOU  
    STAYING WITH US"" just say NO TO BOTH AND WALK AWAY. It's a time share
     scam with a free breakfast and show tickets followed by a 2 hr conference hosted 
     by Bernie Madoff. We did not attend but inquired deeper. Get my point? Tacky!!   
* WIFI IS HELLA EXPENSIVE!!! $25 for 12 hrs, etc. AT&T iphone gets ZERO SERVICE ANYWHERE INSIDE THE FLAMINGO!
* Go to the ""BEACH POOL"" for peace and quiet it's off the chains good. The other BIG 
     pool is pretty much hosted by MTV (not really but really) and is AWESOME if you 
     are 21 - 21 and a half.
*  Check out the Flamingo's, they's is cool. :)
* Bring your own coffee maker and fixins. Smart people do anyway.
* The ""Cut"" restaurant is AMAZING!! $50-$85-ish a plate but the atmosphere is 
   superb, the service is 5 star. Marcos was our server and he treated us like we
   were paying $1000 a plate. Food is Perfect! Hats off to the Chef!! 
* Last Tip! Don't stay here!!! but DO go to the restaurant ""The Cut."" 
PS. Partying is so bad in the hotel rooms that we actually packed up at 2am (our third night), got a refund and left back to LA, drove all night just to get away from the Flamingo who didn't do crap about the 30 people going from room to room on our floor. What a shame! Fist Bump!",7,3,0

I have never paid so much for such a shitty room. The rates for each night were 160, 78, 180 and 270 dollars (this is with booking two months in advance). I've had better rates in Hilton hotels in Downtown locations and honestly, much more impressive rooms. 

The carpets were covered in dirt and stains. The walls looked like they had been subjected to multiple groups of drunken idiots going crazy. 

The bathroom had a fan (i think) but it sure as hell didn't work. The shower was nearly impossible to use because I would pull the mechanism for going from the spout to the shower head, but the spout would just spray everywhere. When the shower head did work, the pressure was low and I had to watch my feet because the spout was like a pressure washer at a car wash. 

When it came to getting food, I regularly would have to wait as long as a half hour for a line not more than 15 people long. In addition to the wait, the employees at many of the service establishments in the hotel itself looked as if they hated their lives and jobs, and treated me like it was my fault. The food court was the only place that seemed relatively quick, but even those establishments redefined the meaning of fast food with their slow pace. 

I have never felt so mistreated by employees of a hotel in my life. Ironically the only polite employees were the house keeping staff, and I only had two opportunities to interact with the kind lady keeping my room.

The only good thing is the location, which I am convinced is not worth the price. It has to be one of two things with this hotel: One, the ownership\/management literally doesn't care because they own so many casino\/hotels on the strip that they have no chance of going under, or two, the flamingo is literally the poorest performing casino the Caesars entertainment group owns and they don't care to invest in making the place respectable. Either way, I will never return to this hotel. It's better to be treated with respect and care than to save money.",0,0,0

This hotel is not somewhere I would choose stay, so I cannot speak to the rooms.  I have a feeling that would take a star or two away from this rating.  In looking at their site, the rooms appear to be updated.  Regardless, there are so many deals at even the top properties in Vegas that there is no reason to try a room here.  The location is fantastic, right in the heart of the Strip, across from Caesar's Palace and close to everything.

Needless to say, we were extremely disappointed as we came to Vegas on spring break for some pool time parties. There were no signs to let us know that either, no pre-warning of any kind.

The room DID look exactly like the one in the picture.  Exactly, in fact.  King sized bed (pretty comfy), flat screen tv, REALLY cheap and ugly pink\/black furry.....thing and all.  Didn't really appreciate the ghetto tagging etched into the window.  But that was small and easy to ignore.  And we really loved how centrally located the Flamingo is on the strip.  The Paris and Caesar's are a short walk away (well, ""short"" in Vegas terms).  We were enjoying our stay and the casino (did really well at Black Jack and the dealer - his name was T.G. - was alot of fun!!).  Had breakfast at the Paradise Buffet on Sunday morning.  You pay for the buffet up front and input your tip (kind of weird to tip before you've had your meal).  I input $6.00 as the tip.  The girl at the register mistakenly input $600.00!!!  No problem, though, she caught the mistake herself and said she would fix it.  Midway through our breakfast, she brought us a new receipt showing the corrections.  Cool.

Next morning, we want to check out.  So we go to the handy dandy ""Express Checkout"" function on our TV.  I've done this many times at many hotels.  We go through the whole process only for the TV to tell us the ""Express Checkout"" is not working.  Great.  So we go to the Lobby and head for the Registration Desk.  The line is huge.  And, yes, there were only 3 people at the Registration Desk.  Someone else here commented that they have WAAAY to few people working the desk for a property of this size.  And they are absolutely right.  And the 3 people that were working were so SLOOOOOOW!!!  After awhile, and realiziing we were going to be late for our flight, my partner noticed one of those old fashioned express checkout boxes where you fill out the card, drop your keys and the card in the box and you're on your way.  Fine.  Did it.  Done.  Rushing to the taxi stand, we notice there are about 6 people ahead of us.  And no taxis waiting.  No taxis.  None.  At a Las Vegas hotel.  In the center of The Strip.  The ""helpful"" taxi attendant said that the hotel shuttle was right around the corner and waiting and it's only $7.00.  We were pressed for time and couldn't afford to go to 6 different hotels to pick up more people (we took the shuttle from the airport to the Flamingo and stopped at 7 properties before they dropped us a block from the hotel entrance - they said it was due to construction but, it's funny, to pick people up, they pulled right up to the door).  So, we told him no, thanks.  We'll wait for a cab.  He says, ""Ok, gonna be awhile.""  And walks away.  5 minutes later, the shuttle leaves the property.  And wouldn't you know it, as soon as the shuttle leaves, taxi after taxi after taxi showed up like the Flamingo was the only resort in town.  That got me so mad I couldn't stand it!!  What a scam!!!  The taxi ride only cost $15.00, with tip!

So, outside of the Flamingo's influence, the flight home was fine.

The original Flamingo was demolished around the 70's to make way for bigger up to date resorts just like they are doing currently.  

I picked the Flamingo because we got a comp room for a Go Room Deluxe Strip View room over the weekend (which can be very pricey) and thought it would be a great deal since it's free on the weekend, recently renovated and right smack on the central strip.  We were transferring from Bellagio after staying 2 nights and stayed 2 more nights at the Flamingo and there is comparison between the 2 resorts other then the location. Valet parking was horrible as the line to valet was long until the attendant came and told us the parking garage was full and we had to leave our car outside for it to be parked. We needed the bell guy to take our bags from our car and when he arrived and waited around 20 minutes for him to arrive and when he arrived he picked up the bags and put his hand out and and wanted a tip right away and I thought that pissed me off but I didn't to make a scene so I tipped him a $1. 

Going to the check in area was a bit of a stretch from the the valet area, you'd have to take the escalator up to the lobby area and walk across the mall area and a few restaurants to get to the front desk where you are greeted with a long line. Also the some of the Flamingo Hotel employees were doing some dance around the lobby area, probably for some employee appreciation thing which I find odd since I never seen that before. The ventilation is a bit smokey and you can also smell a scent they pump in the air like a tropical or coconut smell probably to help clear out the smoke smell. Elevator area was very outdated and very retro 70's like and needed a massive overhaul, the hallway up to the room was very clean in our tower with the pink and white color tones that blends in the the renovated go tower. Not all the towers were renovated as you can tell when walking from one tower to another the hall goes from clean and vibrant to just filthy, old and smokey. 

Our Go Deluxe Room very nice and clean and appreciated the fridge and complimentary coffee maker and 2 coffee packets. The TV was a flat screen but the remove didn't work and so I called housekeeping and found out the batteries were dead but were replaced right away. The beds were very soft but what bothered was the no wifi in the room so I can check for any important email on my phone and check the news on my smart phone. But I'd have to pay $30 for 6 hours  only for the hotel part and if I wanted to use it throughout the Flamingo property, I would have to pay more I thought was a total rip off. The bathroom was pretty nice but needed some maintenance with the bathroom door not closing all the way and the shower jets on the wall was a nice touch but it would leave the bathroom partially flooded. I liked the small TV built inside the bathroom mirror but I hardly used it but the AC was very strong in the room ad felt like an ice chest, the view of the strip was a nice touch with the Bellagio fountains in the left side of the window and Caesars in the front but at night you can hear the music from Pure nightclub with the thumb thump sound which didn't annoy me a lot and it did stop around 4 am when I would be getting ready for bed. =P
 
After coming from the Bellagio pool, I didn't expect a lot from the Flamingo pool are other then the pictures I've seen on the website but average and not too classy but was very disappointed. The music was very loud with beer bottles all around the pool and trash floating on the water takes away the ambiance and the crowd was full of undesirables but had some eye candy and that helped out, not too much. The security guards at the entrance felt like I was going through a TSA checkpoint in Los Angeles and asked me to open my bag and checked my ID if I was over 21 so I can stay with in GO pool area. Sadly I always look forward to staying in the pools in Vegas especially in the 100+ heat but I only stayed for less then an hour and decided to just walk to the strip to shrug off this horrible pool experience. 

Customer service and restaurants were average and the casino needed a major overhaul, they did have a food court in the lobby but it wasn't worth the money spent. 

I gave the Flamingo 2 stars for the location and 1 star for the comped renovated room. 

Would I stay here again?

Maybe if it was free but I'd rather pay more for a more upscale hotel.",1,0,0

I called the front desk to ask if we could change rooms, but because of some Dance Rave that sold out the entire strip there were no more double beds. So we had no other option, but to stay in the room assigned. Thank God, I brought Clorox Wipes and Lysol with me, I personally had to clean the place myself! 

The following morning, I followed up about moving rooms and they said I didn't give them an opportunity for them to clean it up, which I did, no one ever showed up!

It was more like they put different furniture to make it an upgrade all the while it's still an old dirty room. 

Housekeeping had an attitude and was rude when asked for extra sheets, she said ""You need to call for them,"" which was fine, but she didn't have to be rude about it. 

The swimming pool was ridiculous! The larger pool was designated for the adults anyone 18 and older. While the smaller pool was for the kids & family which we were so cramped we couldn't even swim! Didn't they know that they had a Dance Convention that would be bringing their families??? Everyone was so upset! 

The front desk Agent was rude as well! No empathy for the problems we were having. 


I DO NOT RECOMMEND this place for anyone! Rooms are disgusting and dirty, the rugs throughout the property were filthy! If the hotel is not similar to your home, why would you settle for less??? 

We will NEVER EVER STAY HERE AGAIN! You couldn't pay us to stay there again! The WORST HOTEL, they need to BULLDOZE IT and START OVER!!",3,1,0

We stayed at (in this order) Bally's, Planet Hollywood, Paris, Caesars, RIO & Flamingo. And the only place worse was Bally's. The Valet parking is hard to find and very far from check hotel check in which means to go anywhere u practically can walk there before u get to valet to get ur car. And Kate night there was only one person working. The carpet is filthy in most of the casino & hotel, the elevators are gross filled with spit, mucus, vomit and possibly urine. In the hallways leading to our room the carpet was bubbling up as if it was installed by rookies. The casino dealers are clueless on payout so if u don't know ur payout u will be short changed or sometime overpaid. Most could careless about being tipped apparently. The slot machines were half working many cannot accept money or vouchers. Poor sound if working and buttons not working. Many ATM\/change machines out of service or unplugged. The worst QUALITY Control I've seen in a long time. If I ran this place I'd be embarrassed or if the person who ran this place for me I'd fire them tomorrow. What an embarrassment. 

The only positive note was the restaurant Center Cut was amazing! Excellent service, courteous staff and great food. Maybe the person running Center Cut should run all of The Flamingo.

Finally to there defense maybe it was so horrible because the are remodeling and replacing this crappy decor? All the other locations mentioned above made us extend our vacation another day or two & that's why we stayed at so many hotels but this shit hole is making me consider ending a day early, what was up until now the best vacation in  a long long time.

The service is horrible. I checked in on Sunday and there was a room service tray full of half eaten\/ puked food in the hallway right out of the elevator. Made me almost vomit walking by it. The next day, I tried to put the tray on the room service cart she refused to take it, I did take one of her towels to cover the the food. I later told the Hotel Manager about it, thinking he would have someone do something.  Next day (2 days) later, the tray was still there.

Anyways, We were on the 16th floor, as we walk in, our jaws dropped, literally all the way down to lobby! Everything was so old inside, the dresser was falling apart, the tub faucet was leaking, mold everywhere, drain was so.....slow! Around the sink area more.....MOLD!  The motel at Disneyland area is way better! 

Even if the room is at a medium price .. don't give customers a dirty presentation! 

Also this place gave me a phobia of elevators! My dad and I decided to get some breakfast downstairs. We entered the elevator, and got down to 3rd floor, all of a sudden the light for lobby goes out, and I was thinking to myself why it wasn't lit anymore (we haven't even reached lobby level) and that's when chaos started, the elevator decided to do a Hollywood Terror Hotel Mode. It would literally go up really fast and bounce for the longest time until we reached the 22nd floor,and it was a relief that the elevator doors opened! Then we saw this housekeeper and told her that this elevator is malfunctioning, and all she did was stood there and said, ""I know."" UH OKAY?!?!? what.. NO COMPRENDE INGLES?!

Fix your parking structure and do more improvements in your rooms and hire better housekeepers!

-Good location on the strip.
-There was a lot of food places on the ground floor and nearby, which was helpful because I was sick and couldn't venture far.
-Room was relatively clean, only complaint was there was some shower gel on the shower curtain that no one cleaned off and there was stained\/flaking drywall on the ceiling above the shower from what I presume was a leak.
-Check-in and check-out was really easy at the self-serve kiosks.
-There's a nice little shopping area on the outside of the casino where there are shops and restaurants.

Cons:
-I felt bad for the caged birds on the main floor. They are around the hustle and bustle of people all day, which can't be healthy. I think they need some secluded quiet time without people around.
-Not enough hot water in the morning when everyone was showering
-The heat did not work in our room the first night, but when we called the next morning they did send someone to fix it.
-Parking situation was terrible.  It was free in their garage, but the night we arrived it was like they had run out of spaces?  It was very confusing and there was no one to direct traffic and we got stuck in a dead end at one point and just, ugh.

Overall, a fine experience for the price of the hotel room.  Next time I might consider upgrading to one of their nicer room options.",5,1,1

We called them months in advance to make sure that our two rooms were adjoining. We called the hotel on the day of check in to confirm our reservations and they told us that we didn't have any! After a 2 minute mini-heart attack and a transfer to someone else our reservation was found. We also confirmed again that our rooms would be adjoining. Flash-forward. We get to Vegas and check in. Our rooms were not adjoining. The closest that we could get was across the hall from each other, which worked out okay for us. 

The hall carpet desperately needed replaced. It was bunched up in the hallways and was not easy to walk on with heels. The hotel room itself was okay. The TV was turned on once and we could not get it turned off. We tried using the remote and the power button and that sucker was on for good....We had to unplug the TV to eventually get it off. The only other complaint would be the toilet seat. At first we thought it was dirty but turns out it was just yellow stains... ALL over the seat. It was kind of gross.

The only redeeming quality is the rooms were dirt cheap when I stayed there and compared to the surrounding hotels significantly less expensive.  I can see why.  My room had grime on the walls and peeling wallpaper.  The bathroom toilet was broken (minor issue as I was able to self-repair) and the lamp shades were cracking.   The room had almost no water pressure.  There was graffiti on the hallway walls on my floor.  The elevators were borderline scary and only semi-functional for the duration of my stay.   Sometimes the doors scraped against the elevator car when opening, or the doors would open very slowly.  One was out of service altogether for the entire 4 nights I stayed here.  There was also colorful graffiti in the elevators as well.    

     The staff was otherwise nice but don't expect any helpful amenities (no toothpaste delivery to your room for example, you can buy that in the lobby for $4 for a travel size).

     Internet was 15 dollars a night, which I guess is understandable since the room was so cheap.   

     Casino floor was typical if otherwise unexciting to look at.   They do have a decent poker room with limit games if you prefer that to no-limit.  A lot of the surrounding hotels don't have limit games so I guess that's a draw.   Nothing special about the restaurants here but they weren't terrible either.
   
     The Flamingo should probably invest in a maintenance person to actually repair the broken things all over the hotel.  Either that or they should demolish the place since it's clear they aren't interested in keeping it in presentable shape.

The Burbank Channel 70 people have a long history of using the Flamingo as a venue for affordable meetings. Again, the hotel handled our small meeting with their expected professionalism. For privacy purposes, we always scatter our rooms. I drew the short straw and ended up with a small and rather plain (as compared to LV standards) room with a partial view of the IP, but it served the purpose. The next morning the sounds of construction acted as an alarm clock. It's good to know people are employed doing construction in these tough times. It was a good sound to hear.

This was purely a poker trip, so I wanted something centralized on the strip.  You can't beat the Flamingo in that area.  Also wanted a clean room.  Check!  I did have a minor issue where I was staying on the 18th floor.  There was lots of marijuana smells.  I called the front desk and complained, and they very easily gave me another room, didn't have a GO room upgrade, but were able to give me a room with a view of the strip.  It was actually quite awesome to wake up every morning\/afternoon and watch the business that is the strip.  The basic cheap room they usually give you is just the back of the hotel, a much uglier view.  As for the elevators, which people seem to be having an issue about these days, they were not bad when I was there in 2014.  All were functioning, even though a little worn and beat up.

The place is located central on the strip directly across from Caesar's Palace. It's also right near the High Roller and the hourly water show. It is large, flashy, and fun. There were even actual Flamingos outside. 
Our room was a non-smoking double queen room on the 27th floor. Very high, but the view was amazing. We could see the other casinos as well as the mountains in the background. The room had a couch and the beds were incredibly comfortable. We also had a coffee machine and TV. I felt right at home and very happy here. 
When we had to book an extra night at kind-of the last minute, the service desk was very accommodating and made the process easy. We even got a lower rate for the extra night. 
I would recommend the Flamingo to anyone looking for an affordable yet exciting place to stay on the Strip.

After we returned at 1 am ( been up since 5 traveling) we couldn't sleep because the people in tedium next door were having A party in the hallway. I couldn't call security because our phone was out, the entire time we were there. after a sleepless night we went to the cafe for breakfast but it was so bad I set my food back and just has coffee.  By the second day we were miserable. Unshowered and unrested we were very grumpy. First vacation we've taken in 10 yrs. The party next door continues until 7 AM the next day. When we got up that morning there was garbage, including an overturned plate of honest food strewn across the hallway. It sat for hours

The elevators were a whole othe issue as well. Rickety and sketchy describe them best. At one point a little girl was crying to her parents ""I don't want to get in here!"". They were filthy as well, garbage and cigs just sat there. 

The 3rd night we switched rooms due to our unruly neighbors. The water pressure was better, but partway through my shower I discovered some goo on the shower curtain. I'm pretty sure it was vomit. So I jumped out of the first good shower I'd had in 3 days. when we went to bed, exhausted, we discovered the heater only blew ice cold air. We turned it off and called for extra blankets. 40 min later I had to call again.

So my friends and i decided on this hotel due to the fact it is 1) inexpensive, 2) conveniently located in the middle of all the action. and 3) we had stayed there once before so already knew what to expect. 

Hotel has check in kiosks i tried using one for faster check in, but doesn't let you check in and use cash to pay for the room\/deposit.... so i has to wait in line since i prefer paying cash and leaving a cash deposit rather than with a debit card.... so back in line i go, check in was easy but semi-long line. 

hotel lobby and casino and literally outside of the casino have a gross cigarette smell to it, quite disgusting especially if you're hungover. LOL. 

elevators suck and are really slow :\/ 
my room wasnt cleaned at all the 3 nights i was there, toilet paper wasn't stocked we had to call the front desk to bring us some, which took literally 1hr to deliver a roll....

-no microwave or fridge in the basic rooms and furniture is outdated, dirty floor mat, small bathroom, and super dim lights. also, AC wasn't working it was so stuffy in the room and also no window to open. :( 

i think the worst part was the bedding itself. it causes my friends and i to become super itchy an develop a rash, either the bed had bed bugs or the detergent they use for the sheets caused an allergic reaction..... at this point i'm starting to think it's probably bed bugs...

pros....
-located in the middle of everything 
-walking distance to drais & Tao nightclub 
-casino waitresses were pretty quick to refill your drink while playing the slot machines 
-lost my car keys and realized once my flight landed in CA, contacted the flamingo lost and found and they made it super easy to have my lost items delivered to me. 

would i stay here again? maybe, if i was on a budget , this is a good hotel if you're literally just going to party in vegas and rarely stay in the room. it sucked to get ready to go out in a dim room :\/ 
 
i think it's time i find a new hotel to stay at when i go to vegas. goodbye flamingo. you have been warned.",1,0,0

The room was in serious need of repairs, I had a giant hole in the ceilings of the shower and absolutely no hot water or water pressure. I told management about the issues but they were dismissive. Internet is also not included in the resort fees, it's a additional $24 per day per device. To me that wouldn't be a big deal as my phone has it's own hot spot but somehow I think the hotel has a way to block the connection as it didn't work at all. Lastly, I reported a case of theft to management. Management said they would have security come to my room to file a report, nobody ever came.",0,0,0

The parking structure has limited spaces (many ppl can't even find a space, we were lucky tho) and far away from hotel lobby. Valet line was a long wait too and often full. Check in line was long and moving very slow. Front desk staffs unfriendly. Room was newly renovated, pretty nice, but the habitat tower was very far away from lobby and not luggage friendly, I have to go thru stairs couple times which was very troublesome. Despite all this, I was still excited to live in flamingo cuz I was prepared parking would be a problem until....

Here is why I gave out a two star rating. When I booked my room thru totalrewards call center, I had a promotion code buy two nights and get one night free. The receptionist told me if I don't use the promotion code, they are offering me free helicopter rides. I was pretty skeptical and asked ""Really? Free helicopter rides around the strip for one or two? Cuz we have a total of two ppl stay in the hotel room."" The receptionist asked me to hold and she came back to me saying they will give me two helicopter VOUCHERS at the front desk when I checked in. I was so excited and thinking it is a great deal. However, when I got to the hotel, checked in and they have me a COUPON for the helicopter rides which is buy one get one free. My local friend told me the helicopter prices on the coupon are more expensive than what they can get me. I asked the front desk about the VOUCHER totalrewards told me about over the phone. A lady at the mails and keys gave me attitudes and funny faces while she looked up on her computers, she even gave me silent treatment when I asked her questions. And I told her it's fine I don't get the helicopter rides but I want my buy two get one free promotion code applied to my bills. She said she can't do anything and brushed me off. I only spoke to her 5-10 sentences and she made me wait and looked at her computer for over 20 minutes before brushed me off. I am like, if you can't do anything about it, it's fine but don't give me attitudes and hold me there with your funny faces and not solving any problems. I don't even blame the call center receptionist for wrong information but the mail and key staff made me really angry.",0,0,0

We ate at the Mexican restaurant there and had a few really good margaritas with some fish tacos. We had fun walking the strip but never seemed to stray from our hotel. The casino was lit almost all day long and we felt a very friendly vibe from hotel staff, floor and drink girls and card dealers.

I am not a gambler, so I cannot comment on that.  My family booked the Flamingo for three reasons: location on the strip, good experiences in the past, and the rating of the family pool.  The service this time, though, was without a doubt, the worst service I have ever experienced in Las Vegas...at ANY hotel.  

It started with check in.  I arrived at 3:00pm to a very long line of people at the front desk.  There were two desk agents.  After finally making it to the front of the line I was immediately informed I would be charged the ""early check-in fee"" of $16.00 because at that time it was a few minutes before 4:00.  No ""Hello.""  No ""Thank you for waiting.""  Nothing.  I wasn't going to wait in line again, so I agreed to the fee.  When my family and I made it to our room, it was the wrong kind of room - single King bed - which was not what we reserved.  I called from the phone in the room they told me to go back to the desk.  After a bit of protest, they sent me to the key desk to avoid the line.  We were sent to another room on the other side of the hotel.  The process took 1.5 hours or so by the time we were finally in the room.  No apologies for the screw-up, not even a ""Please"" or ""Thank You"" or even a ""Thanks for picking the Flamingo.""

As mentioned, the pool got good reviews for families.  Well, it was awful.  I had been to the pool at the Flamingo multiple times in the past before there was a 21 and over pool and a kid's pool.  In order to carve out a kid's pool, it appears they took about 1\/3 of the total pool space to allocate to families.  As a result, the kid's\/family pool was packed! Poolside service was nonexistent.  Lines at the snack\/beverage counter took on average, 30 minutes.  My wife was quick to point out, though, that the only place there was no line for the restroom in Las Vegas was at the Flamingo pool.  Hmmmm.

We were supposed to stay five nights, but left after three.  We just couldn't take it anymore.  When my wife called down to the front desk to change our departure date, 40 hours in advance, the agent said that she could not waive the early check-out fee.  Apparently, that could only be done by a manager, who was not available.  When she asked when the manager would be available, the answer was, ""they are very busy and may not be available.""  I called down to ask the same question about 15 minutes later.  That time, the agent said that since the manager was not available, she would waive the fee.

As mentioned previously by another person, you get what you pay for.  The room rates were good, but it doesn't make up for the poor service and the misrepresented facilities. I will not stay at the Flamingo again, regardless of the price.",0,0,0

It's the hotel's take on mid-century modern, but it's definitely more modern than mid-century. Yes, there is a large flat screen tv and a tv in the bathroom mirror. Large bathtub, separate shower. There is an audio system with a hookup for an ipod, but you need a cable (not your iphone or ipod charger) to hook into the system. We called the front desk to get one and they said they were out and that the cables have been placed on backorder. 

The location of the hotel and the hotel rates really can't be beat. It's in the middle of the strip right across from the Bellagio and Ceasars. We had a view of the Bellagio water show thingy from our room. The strip is really walkable from this location. And there is also a bus stop for the Deuce ($7 bucks for a 24 hour pass) right outside the hotel entrance.  If you want to go up to Fremont Street from the strip, I recommend getting a pass for the Deuce or the Ace (which is the express bus).  Cabs to downtown from the Flamingo can be $15-$20 depending on the time of day and the route. 

A tip when you are checking in...if you already have a reservation and you have the credit card you reserved the room with you don't need to wait in the long line to check in with a human being. There are computer kiosks towards the end of the front desk. You can check in there and get your room keys dispensed from the kiosk. Otherwise, you may end up waiting up to 20-30 minutes to check in.",8,0,0

pros:
- location! located right in the middle of the strip, it was easy to go to surrounding hotels, although due to the insane summer heat my friends and i taxied it to most of our destinations
- mini fridge in the room was great! kept our vodka ice cold! :P
- burger joint: flamingo's all night diner had a great deal - the burger deal or whatever, but basically a burger and fries for only $2! cant beat that

cons:
- room cleanliness: the carpet in the room looked like the floor of a frat house; stains everywhere - even in the closet! ... i was also unsettled by the beginnings of mildew on the shower curtain
- check in: i wasnt expecting the long line at the check in counter at 1am on a friday. i had to wait an HOUR in line just to check in. i didnt understand it considering it only took me about ten mins when i got to the counter

would i stay here again? probably not. i came on the recommendation from a friend that the renovated rooms were very nice, and im sure they are, but if you get stuck in the older wing of the hotel, dont expect anything! its only slightly better than a motel. so not worth the amount of money i paid ($240 for two nights!)",1,0,1

We arrived at 12:45pm on a Wednesday and was informed check in was at 1pm and it would be an extra $20 to check in early or go to the kiosk to check in. The kiosk area was a complete zoo as is the Lobby area. Oh they did offer us $10 off if we declined housekeeping services during our stay.  Really???  Then to get to our room we had to pass the time share folks who are trying to sell you every time you walk by.  Seriously!!! WTH!!! The casino is out of date and the rooms even more out of date. The bathroom in our room was tiny and the shower pressure was horrible. There are two pools one that blasts loud music and the family pool where you can still hear the loud music thumping from the party pool. By the way, it was a Wednesday and Thursday.  I can understand doing the party pool on the weekends but for the love of God give it a rest during the weekdays.  Check out is 11am asked for a 12pm check out but that of course is an extra $20.  Basically, this hotel caters to the young kids on a budget.  I could have stayed at Treasure Island for the same price and it's much nicer, more modern and has great customer service.

Upon arrival we went to check in at the platinum desk.  Then the dreaded words came that this room in not remodeled.  I knew from the reviews that this room would be nasty and I would not be spending by birthday there.  They said they could give me a normal Go room for an additional $100.  This made no sense to me why I would have to pay more for a room that was originally less.  They had no good excuse.  She even went to talk to her boss.  She came back with the rude answer that since we were newly upgraded platinum due to getting their credit card they couldn't wave the charge.  So now we are basically being told we don't matter due to how we got our platinum status.  Sorry but platinum should be platinum.  Quite rude and demeaning.

Mrs. M and myself have stayed at the Flamingo several times before and found it to be a good value In terms of price, gambling stakes and location on the strip.
When checking in for the love of God, do yourself a favor and use the self check kiosks. The lines are ridiculous at almost all hours but the kiosks always seem to be empty for some odd reason.
When checking in, Greg helped us out with the process but the machines went down so he took us into the private area for VIP's and there we found out that they lost our reservation for an upgrade to a Go Mini Suite. This was not good since our room was going to be the starting point for partying and we needed some space. I explained this to the check in person and she worked with her manager to get us into a junior neopolitan suite at the same price.
The room was great with two bathrooms, a wonderful view of the pool and garden area and a few couches to sit on while we had our warm up beverages. The only draw back was the smell of the hallway in the evenings which gave the aroma of cat urine. Thankfully the room didn't.
The casino is great at The Flamingo, the stakes are near the lowest you can get and most dealers are pretty cool. We were a large group and could get a little silly and most were tolerant of our loudness and occasional salty language, however a few did give us warnings to tone it down.
The pool is still beautiful is it was a few years ago, but the theme is very different with the booty shaking contest and people swimming around all loaded trying to hook up. I wish it was little more upscale and relaxing, but I guess they aren't trying to appeal to middle age people very much these days.
Checkout was smooth thanks again to the kiosks as the line up on Sunday morning was crazy long. The same fellow who checked us in, Greg, was there to help. When I was done I tipped him and asked if he could help to get my wife to the front of the bag check line and he was more than happy to oblige so I could get back to some final partying with my brother who was set to leave in a short time.

I had my hands full with tons of decorations, desserts, and my husband carrying the champagne to surprise her. I actually started crying! They did not care. Finally one of the the other girls got us up to our room, but the temperature was freezing cold and so was the hallway, the front desk sent someone to fix it but it wasn't truly fixed so we needed a lot of blankets!!! Also, in the morning at 7 am there was a couple next door who were literally screaming at each other every morning At 7 am on the dot! I had to put my headphones in each morning.

When we got there we were placed in a handicapped accessible room that also happened to be adjoining with another. During my finances shower someone in the room next to us tried getting in. In the morning we called down to the desk and we were told a room would be put on hold for us. When we got to our new room it was a strip view room what a unexpected treat. 

All the staff that we in countered were very friendly hence why we keep coming back. My favorite experience was when I left both room keys in my room, when I went to the desk for new ones her response was ""hey it's Vegas"" . 

The casino was nice for one of the older places on the strip. All the dealers were awesome. 

The buffet was not that good. We went during lunch and we found that it was very similar to the dinner buffet at Harrahs. The all night pizza place is five star great for the 3am snack.

The flamingo USE to be a free resort but at checkout we were told about the twenty plus dollar a night resort fee. Guess there is no free resorts anymore. 

A word of advice when checking in, make sure you specify that you do not want to be near the construction going on. That is of course you are planning on getting any sleep.",0,0,0

I reserved a room for 3 days not knowing that our flight leaves a day early. I spoke with someone at the hotel check in desk and informed them of the situation. I asked if I were to checkout Sunday evening as opposed to Sunday around noon. Would I still get a day refund since our flight leaves around midnight on Monday. I was told yes. When the time arrived, I checked out around 8pm on Sunday, confirmed it with another receptionist if I was going to get refunded for Monday. Once again, she said yes. She even printed out a receipt with the billing invoice of what I will be charged with and the amount that will get refunded back to me. Two weeks went by and numerous phone calls and transferring got me nowhere. I guess I could kiss my $186 refund goodbye! Poor attitude and customer services. Definitely not true to their word and a bunch of coy! 
On another note, my boyfriend checked into a room for us on that same weekend. Also got screwed over by them. Their King suite was not worth the price. They're old, smells horrendous and falling apart!

This was our third trip to Las Vegas and the Flamingo is the only hotel we've stayed at there. We've always had a great experience and love the location and the pool. Unfortunately, this time was very different.

We checked in after midnight and met a friend at the bar where we were informed the beer taps were not working. We are beer drinkers, but since it was late we stayed put for a while before heading to our room.

When we went upstairs to our room, there were no blankets on the beds, a brown crusty smear on the chair and some very large moths flying around the room. Room service brought up the blankets and helped us to get rid of the moths - with the washcloths from the bathroom. Guest services had offered to move us to another room, but we were tired and decided to stay.

In the morning (4\/24), we went to the pool and came back to the room in the afternoon after maid service cleaned the room. A tissue that had fallen from the trash in the bathroom the night before was still there and the sink looked about the same as when we left. It was obviously not cleaned thoroughly. 

On Saturday, 4\/25 we headed to the pool in the morning to find that it was reserved for a private event. While this is understandable, we were disappointed because it was not posted anywhere and we only found out because another guest informed us while we were waiting in line to get in. If we had known in advance, or if there were signs informing us of that, it would have been a different story.

That same day it rained. We were gone most of the day and returned at around midnight to find large buckets in the hallway collecting water from the ceiling. The ceiling in our room was also leaking and there was a large puddle on the floor. I called Guest Services who told us they would not move us until the Engineer arrived to confirm that the ceiling was in fact leaking. We waited for close to an hour and called Guest Services again to find out when the Engineer was coming. While on the phone, the Engineer did arrive and said that the roof leaks every time it rains. 

At that point, we were told that a bellman would be sent up with new keys and would take us to a new room. Again, we waited and had to call Guest Services for an update. The manager said that we could have late checkout at 2:00 the next day, but that our keys would be deactivated at 12:00. If we were to leave the room after 12:00, we would be locked out. 

The bellman arrived and loaded our bags onto the cart. While we followed him to the elevator, I noticed a cigarette butt that had been on the same place on the floor since we had arrived. He also mentioned that the roof leaks every time it rains and gave us a heads up that he had heard rumors of hotel employees who rummage through guest's personal belongings.

We arrived at the new room on the 15th floor where other guests were already sleeping. He called the desk and then took us to another room on the 22nd floor. The room was very nice and clean. It made us realize how run down the room was on the 28th floor; not to mention, there were menus for room service and a coupon for the buffet - both of which were not in our original room.

Finally, we went to sleep after 2:00 AM. Two hours later between 4:00-4:30 AM, we were woken up by another guest trying to get into our room. Apparently, we were sent to their room so they had to go back downstairs for a room change. I called the manager at Guest Services again, but she was unavailable to take my call.

At 7:30 AM, I called the manager of Guest Services to confirm our late checkout as we were both exhausted and needed sleep. This time, it was a different manager who was very nice and apologetic for everything we had been through. She guaranteed late checkout for 3:00 PM and assured us that the keys would not be deactivated before then. We couldn't sleep and decided to go to the pool. Fortunately, we checked the keys before leaving because they had been deactivated. So again, we called and new keys were sent up.

I am very disappointed and believe that the Flamingo ruined our vacation. We were comped the daily resort fees, but I don't think that is enough for what happened to be forgivable.",4,0,0

They need new elevators. They were pretty old and shaky every time. The room was nice. A stain on the floor though.

The Go Pool is 21+, which was a very nice surprise. There were ample lounge chairs and plenty of space in the pool and no line at the bar. :) The cabanas seemed a little less than luxurious, but I think everyone knew that already, since they were mostly empty. 

The buffet was pretty good, especially the taquitos. I ate several . I also enjoyed the taco bar, with tons of salsas and toppings, chocolate fountain and dessert bar. Lots of yumminess to choose from. 

My one complaint is that housekeeping seemed a bit slow. We requested extra towels that took several hours to arrive and I passed by someone's room service tray in the hallway for a good 36 hours. Seriously, couldn't that have been cleaned up??

Then some security manager came I told her same thing she also said give me 5 mins and no one came so we started playing in Paris or Aria instead of Flamingo. 3rd morning we again reached at room around 5 AM and some room service people opened our room and came inside and standing in front of our bed.

They are always upgrading some piece of it and seem to be getting it right for most part!  If the food was better this is an easy 4 stars because of the incredible location on the strip and the value....but I will be honest...the food SUCKS!!!  Stay here cheap and eat somewhere else is my recommendation. 

The rooms: Many have been upgraded but the bathrooms seem to be off the remodel list!  It takes 15 minutes for hot water to come out, even after they fixed it!! And those shower heads, oh my , 1970's originals! My GO room though was nice inside .. I liked the look and the view from the 19th floor!  Wood  floors , very clean, Ipod hookup. Be warned though the walls are paper thin. I could hear the  old couple next to me farting as they arose at 6:15am. I actually thought they were even showering in my room!! If your gonna have a sexual adventure, just know that every room around you may be hearing the fun! Families with kids, or friends looking to party before bed, same problem. 

The Flamingo pool is really great! With flamingos even included! Waterfalls, slides, palm trees, its very nice! Totally love it! 

The shopping in casino is limited. The sportsbook is fine. This is either a warning or good news for some of those out there, but hookers seemed to be plentiful around the bars located throughout property, the solicitations can get annoying. Couple of guys were even followed to room elevators. It is Vegas.  

The casino itself seems to always be busy! I really enjoy the craps tables and the personnel in charge of them! They are always a blast!! They have a nice high roller area, lots of slots, and the drink ladies are always around! Table limits are very reasonable at the Flamingo. The Flamingo's air filteration system does not throw out nice smelling fragrance like Aria, you are gonna smell smoke! The doors are always open at the entrance to casino on the Bills Casino side, and enjoy the beautiful Black Jack  dealers that await you!

The food! AVOID!! The fast food area.....ughghhhghgh......The buffets....honestly the worst..The steakhouse, why call it that?  ...anyway I think you get the point! Praying that the new Carlos and Charlies thats opening soon is a huge success with good food!!! 

NOW an important hint when checking in. When checking into the Flamingo the lines at all hours of the day are quite large. I find them the worst in Vegas. Not sure why , but it has always been this way for years and years. New though!! And this is huge!! If you are a Total Rewards member, you can bypass the check in line and go to  the new kiosks located to the right of check in desk. Have your id, your cc, your rewards card ready. I checked in within 3 minutes! It even prints your room cards for you!!!  Its $14 if you want internet\/per day at the Flamingo.

Enjoy the Flamingos location , cheap rooms, and pool!!  Good luck!",11,7,4

The whole atmosphere reeks of cheesey, '70s Las Vegas, and is sorely in need of an overhaul.

There was a perpetual elevator problem - 30 floors of rooms and guests left with only two elevators (when 6 were broken), and when they were ""working"" they would get stuck, and have alarm bells ringing.  Not just an inconvenience, but also a major safety issue with dozens and dozens of guests herded into small waiting areas on every floor.   When we tried to talk to a Manager, we were rudely (and dismissively) blown off.

They charge EVERYONE an extra $200\/room for incidentals but they don't tell you that when you check in or check out.  They eventually make sure that it's returned 7-10 business days later.  I booked 3 rooms...which means I had a $600 extra charge showing on my credit card account a few days after I checked out...that was a shock that  I didn't enjoy.  If they wanted to tie up $600 of my money for 2 weeks they should have been more forthcoming about it.  I researched it and it's technically in the very fine print when you check in...but I still consider this inappropriate.  I travel a lot and they are the only hotel that ever did this to me.  

Just to be clear on this:  I made sure to check out in person instead of doing their ""quick"" check-out to make sure there were no surprises.  They told me I owed $72\/room.  In fact, they initiated a $272\/room charge to my credit account.  If they had told me ""we charged you an extra $200 per room"" and then explained it to me I would not have been as upset.

I was in the hotel industry for 10 years and this was my first experience with such a thing.  To avoid this $28 early check in fee, I was given the option of paying $30 to upgrade to their hip ""GO"" rooms over their substandard rooms.  I say substandard, cause the last time I stayed in one, I wouldn't walk on the carpet barefoot.  Needless to say, the upgrade wasn't worth $30.  Holes in the lamp shades, burnt out bulbs through out the room, an ironing board the was bent and contorted to the point of uselessness, closet doors with broken latches so they wouldn't stay closed, a rattling air conditioner that never cooled the room colder than 74 degrees no matter the temp it was set on and the topper, a testing of their Emergency Life System over the loud speakers at 7:04 a.m.

Yes it does have a smokier smell than most casinos but I did notice in some spots that they added a pleasant fragrance to be released in the air. If they added that fragrance everywhere in the hotel's public areas, it will be much more inviting. 
I heard that the Fab rooms are old and not so great. The hotel should work on renovating all of their rooms to look like the Go rooms. Our Go room was great.

But hey the early bird gets the lounge chairs(they had only lounge chairs at the pool 7 years ago so it was a little easier to find a spot to sit.)
Once they replace the elevators and freshen up the cigarette smell in the public places then they will get a better rating .
Overall if you're looking for a great party atmosphere at a great price, then this is the place to go. It's definitely for the under 30 crowd but I did see quite a few people 50+.
It's in a great location- right in the middle of the strip. Close proximity to the Linq Promenade, Ceasar's, Mirage, Paris and even Bellagio and Venetian. They have better restaurants and only a short walk away.",2,0,0

Our toddler found pills on the floor & ate them thinking they were candy. We spent most of the night with the fire department in our room. The hotel said they would comp our room but forgot when we checked out. Figures. 

Anyway, love the new stores, food court and love the pools as they are great! Pool for toddlers, another for kids and more for the adults. But they're not open in the pouring rain. Didn't discourage us as it was expected. Next...staff was absolutely wonderful!! 

On the way to our rooms, I noticed it's the same carpet from our last stay! Don't wear heals if your don't want to fall flat on your face! I was ok though...moving on. Get into our rooms and noticed they cleaned up the rooms nice but not the bathroom. This is when it went down hill. Pillows suck as they were cheap & only sheets for bedding. Beds are firm and not very comfortable. No fridge, no coffee pot...no nothing. For the price they charge, I was really expecting a whole lot more.

Cheapest rate for a non players card holder was through your choice of third party sites. Valet was friendly and checkin using the kiosks was super easy. Strip view upgrade was offered at the kiosk and was worth it. The habitat tower has had its rooms touched up, but furnishings and furniture show their age. The elevators are hit or miss too.

For less than $80 for three of us, the buffet is no Wicked Spoon but filled us up and had bottomless mimosas, so long as you go to the mimosa window and pick them up yourself. Again, it's what you pay for. If you want better, hit up Caesar's across the street and pay double.

We didn't gamble this trip, but the casino seemed clean, well lit, and not that smokey. If we didn't bring our son with us, we probably would have played.

One big miss was that we placed a 6 second call using the room phone and got charged $21 for it. After my wife politely pleaded, they were willing to knock it down to $10, but that's just ridiculous.

I booked a ""Go Room"" from their website and paid a one-night confirmation fee. The night before I arrived to check in, I called the hotel to confirm my late arrival and room availability. I was told the room I booked would be available when I check in. Added to that, I was told to use the Valet service as that was the best for that time of night.

Once I arrived, I was greeted by a tired valet who informed me that only ""Total Rewards"" members were allowed to valet. I told him that I was not one and was instructed to valet. He, thankfully, took my car and only after I tipped him, did he offer the ""Total Rewards"" valet ticket.

Waiting in line to check in took 60 minutes (this is not an exaggeration). Once I got to a Front Desk agent, they informed me the room I booked was no longer available. This is after I was told it would be only 24 hours before. I was down-graded to a lesser room, which was not renovated nor was a smoking room (as I found out in the room) which I booked. I tried to dial the front desk from my room, but the phone did not work. I had to call using my mobile to get a different room. There was a downgrade option with smoking available and that I would have to come to the front desk the next day to move to the room I originally booked. Additionally, the front desk manager (who, after 25 minutes on hold did I finally speak to) told me to come down to the front desk to get my new keys for that first night. I am the one that had to tell him to send a bellman up. 

After relocation, I had enough. It was an okay room and I didn't want to keep moving around the hotel, every night. Oh, and also, to add insult to injury they told me the would adjust my rate to reflect the cheaper room. Upon getting my folio, I saw they did not. Instead of calling them AGAIN, I decided to pay it anyway just so I don't have to deal with them again... ever again.

Our family booked three rooms for three nights at The Flamingo. Our reservation was made and paid in full three months in advance through American Airlines Vacations. Despite requesting three non-smoking rooms at reservation, two were smoking rooms. We were told at arrival that they were fully booked and we could switch rooms the next day. Not only were our rooms smoking rooms, they were also dirty and dilapidated - dirty footprints on the bathroom floor, dust on furniture, furniture finish gone, paint missing on bathroom cabinets, and more. After two family members waking with allergy issues the next morning including one with a bloody nose and another with a swollen throat, we immediately called and requested to be moved to another room. The operator instructed us to go downstairs at 11 to request a room change. We did as told, actually arriving early, and were promised at that time that the two rooms would be upgraded at no charge and we were to return at 1:00 to receive our keys. The customer service rep assured us the change was secured in the system. We arrived at 1:00, after rearranging our morning vacation plans, only to find that one room was re-reserved by the previous customer and another was not clean and ready at that time.  After determining the customer service rep at the counter could no longer assist us any further in making the agreed upon change, we requested to see a manager.  Roemon Murphy, the guest service manager who deceptively wears a pin identifying him as the hotel manager, arrived but never apologized for the inconvenience we had experienced.  He did agree to move us to non-upgraded rooms on a different floor that were available. We agreed to move into those rooms with the agreement, offered by Roemon, that the resort fees for all three rooms for all three nights would be waived. However, at check-out, we were mortified to find that Roemon went back on his word and only waived the resort fee for two rooms for one night.  After our customer service rep made multiple trips back and forth to Roemon directly without him offering to come forward and assist, we once again had to ask to see him. Roemon arrived and denied making that agreement, even though four of us witnessed the exchange. Roemon Murphy lacks integrity, and concern towards his guests and the reputation of the hotel.

The check-out process was much quicker, however as we were able to utilize the kiosk and were on our way out.

Their rooms were reasonably priced, they had a deal when we booked our room. The hotel itself is older and the room definitely reflected the age although it was relatively clean. They didn't provide us with any soap or shampoo when we got there so we needed to call in to get some.

The nice part about this hotel is that there are many dining and shopping options right outside. Their parking structure seemed smaller than the ones for other hotels, but we were able to find a spot. If interested, guests are able to look at some real flamingos there as well!

A clientele that looks as though they enjoy the early bird specials?  Check.  A casino that has that old-Vegas touristy nostalgic feeling?  Check and check.

Everyone should visit the Flamingo once.  Even if it's just to stop in and make a lap before classin' it up at Bellagio or classin' it down at Bill's.  I wouldn't recommend anyone spend most of their vacation there, however.  It's crowded because it's in the middle of the Strip, but I get the feeling no one really wins while gambling here.

For a side note on the rooms.... my friend stayed in a ""Go Room"" this past week that I got to check out.  It's large and has a mini-fridge for personal use.  But it's got an odd design to it.... everything looks really plastic-y and there's opaque glass walls around the bathroom.  And speaking of the bathroom, I hope you're comfortable with whomever you're shacking up with...you can hear everything that goes on in the bathroom and there are no locks on the door.  The Flamingo is not a bad place to stay if you get a great deal, but I would consider elsewhere if the prices are comparable to other casinos.

We were in one of the renovated rooms.  Here were some of the little ""touches"" we noticed: 

* The fancy-ass sliding glass bathroom door does not actually shut all the way (one inch gap around the edge) and thus is not even remotely soundproof.  (Guess what I'm doing in here?)  It was also impossible to open and shut quickly or quietly in the middle of the night.    
* Both of the gooseneck lamps installed on either side of the bed felt like they were falling apart, and were so rickety the light would cut out if you jiggled them the slightest bit.  
* The cheap silicone caulking in the shower and bathroom was already developing mildew spots.  
* There was absolutely no way to turn on the light fixture above the bed.  Either we completely missed a light switch after looking around the room for five minutes, or the switch next to the bed in our particular room was miswired.  (It turned on the inexplicable pink go-go lights in the bathroom, as did the switch by the front door.)
* The Ethernet port in the room wasn't assigning IP addresses.
* There was a sign on the sound system that if we took the white iPod cable in the drawer, there would be a $50 replacement charge.  There was no white iPod cable in the drawer.
* There's a TV in the bathroom mirror...showing the finest standard definition cable channels available.  

Anyway, I'm not saying this was a pit by any means, but the little things here and there kind of added up to the overall ""meh"".  We were here because we got a fairly decent deal and it served its purposes, and it's fairly central on the Strip without being as expensive as the Bellagio et al.  That said, next time the Vegas urge hits we might well look for a deal elsewhere.  (Frankly, one big reason to look elsewhere is to be near decent dining.  We left the hotel for every single meal and there was one night when we reeeeally did not want to have to walk four blocks to get something worth eating.)

The staff is ridiculously helpful and friendly which somewhat makes up for the issues at this hotel.  We had an air conditioning unit that would not cool the room - it stayed at 75 degrees at all times (we like the room to be around 70) - I called guest services who said they would have someone come up to take a look - no one from maintenance came in the next hour and I wasn't in Vegas to stay in our room anyway, so we left and figured we'd deal with the stuffy room.  We were in the ""FAB"" room selection - my guess is that anything in that room category are basically the rooms that have not yet been renovated - the furniture was from the 90s, there was a luminous ceiling over the bathroom vanity, chips and nicks in doors and moulding - everything looked well-used.

I stayed at the Flamingo June 2014 for 4 nights for a conference for work. Checking in was an ordeal, but not entirely their fault. When I finally got into one of their ""updated rooms"" I was shocked. The bathroom is always the first thing I check out in a hotel room and the bathroom in this room was horrible. I have stayed in hotels in third world countries with better bathrooms. 

I will say that the nasty room that I was in for the first two nights had an incredibly comfortable bed and pillows, they were actually better in the cheap room than they were in the upgraded room.

Another positive was that their cleaning staff does a good job. I stayed at another hotel after I left the Flamingo and they had a horrible maid service and everything just felt dirty. The Flamingo is an older hotel but you can tell they've been cleaning up messes for years. So my hats off to them for that. 

The third morning I was there my friend went to retrieve something from the closet and the whole closet mirror\/door fell on top of her. She tried to put it back together but found that it had been duct taped together!!! After two nights of being directly above one of the bars and getting NO sleep because of the bumping base well into the wee hours of the morning. The closet falling on my friend was the straw that broke the camels back. We had to be at our conference at 7 am most days so it was rough not to have quiet until 3 or 4 am and having people run through the halls at 5 am who had been partying all day scream WOOOOO!!!! VEEEGGGASSS!!! Not the classiest bunch of people were staying there when I was there. 

The front desk people were very kind to us and got us into another room that had a great view and was much nicer and quieter than the other one. The only problem with that room was that our door wouldn't close properly. I was scared to death and thankful when I heard a knock on my door around 1 am. It was a security guard who let me know that my door was not shut and was stunned to see that no one had noticed the door malfunction. 

All in all I loved the location (in the heart of the strip) and it was a very laid back hotel. I think if you were a kid who wanted to party cheaply it would be fun, but for a professional person there on business it was awful the first couple nights. The pool is def a party pool, but if you don't like a whole bunch of 21 year olds rubbing all over each other drunk with a loud DJ its not for you, but it is VERY Vegas! If it  was on my dime I wouldn't stay there again.",0,0,0

For casino: someone in group was robbed of 109 dollars from a slot machine. We were momentarily not paying attention when the robbery occurred (which is our fault). Apparently there is nothing that can be done-not even a comp or a room credit, a free drink, a I'm really sorry here is a voucher for a meal..... I get it-we should have been paying more attention, but seriously- there are a million cameras in here and apparently they aren't covering all the necessary bases to try to handle these types situations- we were told this is common. We were told that there may or may not be footage of the robbery- cameras are not watching you constantly here- according to the management. To my knowledge no review of anything was done. The ticket was immediately cashed so there was nothing to be done. 

Watch your pockets here, friends. Or better yet just don't come here. I won't be. 

Assistant manager, who I will call *Ken*, was a poor representation of the casino in his behavior. Actually walked away from us when we were discussing the situation with him. Will be making a few calls to discuss better customer compassion and concern for those in this establishment. A few calming words or a I know this is a terrible feeling, let me help by writing you this voucher to a free dessert would have gone a long way in this situation. He could have stayed with us through the filing of the security report. 

For the hotel: visited someone staying here and could not believe the clientele or the condition of the rooms. Everything was old and shabby. No blankets on the beds and the worlds most disgusting bathroom.",2,0,0

I booked a suite back in January for my bachelorette weekend that happened April 25. As a local, I picked the Flamingo for me and my girlfriends to stay because of its central location and the ""Forever Fabulous"" suite was just perfect for our theme. It's pink details throughout the room and spacious floor plan were just what we were looking for. When I had spoken to a lead guest services rep in January I had specified that we needed two roll aways in our room and she assured me that would be no problem. I called again earlier this month to reconfirm my reservation and again made sure the note was on my confirmation about the roll away requests. It was. 

We arrived around 11:30 knowing our room might not be ready but decided to see about checking in early and getting some pool keys anyway. The line was SO long. We waited over thirty minutes just to check. Of course the room was not ready so the woman let us know to check back but gave us some pool keys. We checked back around 3:30 and the room still was not ready. (It is supposed to be ready by 4:00 pm) Once again at 4pm we checked in, they told us the room was ready, but when we went to go try the room key it did not work. May I also mention right now that their elevator system is HORRIBLE! Six elevators and every time we needed one it was a solid fifteen minute wait! This took us an extra 30 minutes just to get in our suite!! When we entered the room we noticed there were no roll away beds. We called the front desk over TEN times to try and get someone to bring them up! They transferred us, put us on hold and then hung up on us each time. We finally gave up. 

At check out good luck trying to get a bell hop to help you bring your bags down. We called for that to and they told us 45 minutes to an hour wait. How are you supposed to check out on time if you can't even get your bags downstairs?? Another twenty minute wait for the elevator and four trips downstairs to get all of our luggage down. We headed over to valet to pick up my car and waited another thirty minutes! We had reservations at noon for brunch for 10 girls at another hotel and we were an hour late for it. This was completely out of my control. I was more than disappointed with the quality of service, delay of absolutely everything we needed, and what we asked for we did not receive.

I can say I stayed in the un-renovated part of the hotel and it was pretty much the worst.  It bears mentioning that probably 10% of the hotel rooms are renovated.  The Spa Tower, the Habitat Tower and the Shite tower or whatever it was called are not renovated. 

The hotels in Las Vegas have themes: Paris is done in a French motif, Bellagio is some kind of balloon motif, and the Flamingo is done in the stain motif.

Where to begin?  The heavily stained carpet?  The wallpaper & paint peeling off the bathroom wall?  Yuck.  P.U.   When I was trying to come up with positives for the room, I noted that there was hot & cold running water and also an electrical outlet.  And a window. The outlet turned out to be one of those stretched out ones that your plug just falls out of.  (Insert dirty joke here).

My friend had a somewhat more cheerful yet un-renovated room, and, I'm not exaggerating here, we had to step over strange, gigantic, sullen-teens to get into and out of her room.  Weird, overfed she-teens converged and just hung out in the door-well of her room.  Was there a Beiber impersonator rumored to be there?  It is a mystery that will remain unexplained forever.

For reference, we stayed in the Go Deluxe Suite. 

Pros: 
- Smack dab in the middle of the Strip
- Cheap tables (for the Strip)
- Affordable rooms
- TV inside my bathroom mirror (awesome for getting ready)
- That awesome ""Flamingo-ey"" smell that you can't get anywhere else!
- Late night food court

Cons:
- Rooms are clearly older, including carpet, TV's, lighting, and decor
- Elevators are scary as hell. (This coming from a person who takes an elevator every day to get to my apartment)
- Valet is so slow. It pained me to tip after waiting 30 minutes to get my car. 
- Hotel is next door to the Bill's remodel and construction is loud and constant. (Has been going on for about a year and will continue for at least another year)
- BLACK HOLE of internet and phone service.

After staying at Flamingo, I think in the future I will just come here to gamble rather than to sleep. The hotel is a little too outdated for me and I missed some of the glitz and glam that you get when you stay at places like Palazzo.",6,2,0

Upon checking in, we were approached by a lady in nice looking black suits.  She directed us to a booth where we were to ""receive our welcome gift"".  There, we spent over 1\/2 hr with another lady who tried to get our IDs to sign up for a ""free 2 hour tour"" in order to get our ""free gift"" such as free buffet pass, free show tickets, and so on.  We were not sure what the ""tour"" was all about so we told the lady let us get to our room first then cone down and talk to get more but the lady would not let us go and again kept asking for our IDs to sign us up.  We then let get know firmly that we wanted to get our room first and she hit really upset.  Later on, as we read more about their ""tour"" that we learned it was nothing other than a deceiving way to get people sign up for time share, and that these ppl are really pushy and bully, and the tour could take up to excruciating 6 hours.  Thanks but no thanks ""ladies"".  Why do Flamingos let these ppl continue harassing their guests? Idk, but one thing for sure, I will not waste my time with these ppl ever again.

Our hotel room is extremely small, old, and run-down.  The card dealers and the pit managers I encountered were  really rude and they treated their guests with no respect whatsoever.

On the positive note, the buffet has nice atmosphere with the view of the flamingos, and really good service and yummy food.

It was discolored but the renovated shower was fine so we just avoided that tub. They had a coffee maker and when I went to use it there was old water that was already in the Maker, I don't know how long that was sitting there so I just put the lid on it and pretended it didn't exist.

Definitely go for a GO ROOM and you won't regret your stay here. The Go rooms are actually pretty nice, clean, very affordable, and have some spiffy elements to them. The hallways and Go room atmostphere makes me think of a candy\/cupcake shop with a color scheme of pinks\/browns everywhere, but I love the fact that they have a built in TV in the mirrors of each bathroom (Genious!). Bathroom door was a frosted glass sliding door without a lock, and is easily pushed off hinges when you close it too hard. Sometimes it feels like the door does not close all the way. They have an ipod docking system with a pretty good sound system, but you have to obtain the cord form the front desk. 

The hotel itself is in a pretty prime location, smack dab in the middle of the strip and walkable distance to many other bigger hotels\/tourist attractions (bellagio fountains, etc.).Taxi lines were never long and the casino area is alright. 

Turnoffs: Hotel front desk is quite small compared to the other bigger hotels. Lack of front desk staff made the check-in line take forever. There is only one check-in and check-out line, which made checking-out take forever too. PLAN accordingly if you have to make a flight. Obtaining internet connection was a pain and there is a charge for internet here. Demographics of the guests at this hotel was not as hip and young as I would have liked it to be, but it makes sense because this is one of the older hotels around. 

P.S. They have real flamingos and other animals in the pool\/patio area. Pool area is quite big with multiple pools, but I didn't have a chance to check it out.",6,4,6

The room was cute and stylish, bed was comfortable. The automatic drapes and floor to ceiling windows are a nice touch. The sink however would fill up very quickly and drain extremely slow. Our strip view that we paid extra for was covered by a Donnie and Marie banner outside. We also paid extra for an early check in, and was told we would be contacted once the room was ready at noon. By 2:00 we still had not heard anything so I called and sure enough it had been ready the whole time.

My biggest concern and complaint is the valet service.  We parked our car valet on Sunday and picked it up Wednesday, so who knows what could have happened in between.  When we picked it up we immediately noticed our gas tank was 1\/4 tank lower then when we left it, but decided we couldn't really do much about it. Later down the road I noticed a starbucks napkin next to the seat. We have not been to starbucks in this car, its brand new. And finally and most damaging when we stopped for gas 2 hours down the road we noticed a huge deep scrape on the back passenger wheel and a large chunk out of the tire. I have attempted to contact the hotel regarding this and have not received any response. 

The elevators are HORRIBLE, dirty, rickety, some feel very unsafe. The casino was just okay, nothing special, old. Margaritaville was okay, cool decor, lots to look at, food was nothing special but good, same with the drinks. The animal habitat was nice to check out, although from other reviews I expected more. 

We had to pay $20\/day resort fee which is supposed to cover the gym and wifi. Our wifi did not work at all. We also noticed a sign in the room saying wifi was $13.99\/day. Kinda pissed at that!!

The best & worst part of the whole place is the pool. We had lots of fun the two days we spent at the pool. The drinks are strong and the music is fun. The pool food was far better then any of the restaurants at the Flamingo! That being said, shame on Flamingo for allowing just anyone into this pool. We had to stand in line for an hour before the pool even opened just to get a lounge chair. This pool is not just for hotel guests witch is appalling to me! Anyone can pay to get in. In fact they didn't even check our room keys or IDs (21+) upon entering. We could have been anyone off the street. 

Watch out for the various booths around the hotel with people offering you a free show and buffet. It sounded like a great deal and the people were nice, so we signed up. When we went to our free buffet, only then did we find out we were stuck in a Wyndham timeshare scam for 5 hours!!! 

We saw Vinny Favorito at the Flamingo. The show was great! We laughed the whole time. Hes not for everyone though, they do warn you when you buy the tickets. He performs in Bugsy's Cabaret, its almost disgusting in there. They really need to update that room. We were seated on very small chairs placed extremely close together. Chairs and carpet looks VERY dirty, we almost walked out before the show started due to the state of the room. Glad we stayed because Vinny was hilarious. 

We also ate at the Paradise Garden buffet during our stay. It was truly gross. Everything I tried tasted was nasty. Oversalted, stale, real lack of any kind of quality. WAY over priced for what you get to choose from. No dessert bar at all! Very outdated seating & decor. In fact I had the worst stomach ache later that night. Pretty positive it was the buffet food.

All in all we would stay here again if the price was right. Our room and the pool was the best part, and thats what we would come back for. I would take our dining elsewhere. They really need to update the rest of the hotel to match the new style of the rooms. Especially since the Linq is right outside and the Quad is so new and updated.",0,0,0

I wondered, how is it that they are so deep in sh*t? A few nights at the Flamingo would have any customer putting the nails in the coffin for CZR. 

I know Flamingo is one of the older, cheaper, discount hotels on the strip, but I could not have predicted how dire the situation here was. Had I not had my rooms next to everyone else in the company, I would have left and rebooked elsewhere.

Location: 1 star for location. It's the Las Vegas Strip and its next to Drai's newest series of clubs @ the Cromwell (which is owned by Ceasars). 

Rooms: -3 stars. Rooms are clearly outdated. I felt uncomfortable lying in my bed for fear that it had not been clean. My fears of unclean rooms were reinforced by the cockroaches that crawled up my bathroom windows as I washed up in the morning. The bathroom vent next to the old shower and musty shower curtains were also filled with lint. Even if I had wanted to get sleep in the bed, the music from 8 floors below was blaring through the window into my room. I figured it would stop at 4am. Nope. Guests lucky enough to enjoy people watching those in the new Linq outdoors area are also blessed with 24 hours of live music ranging from Ke$ha to all your favorite edm tracks keeping you up all day\/night.

Service: -1 star. I asked to change rooms for only a few hours because by the second night I was dead tired and desperately needed sleep. After being redirected twice, I was told they were sold out and couldn't do anything about it. Thank God for Bose QC15 headphones I have otherwise I may have slept in the bathroom.

Food options: You have a Mexican cafe that services a decent breakfast, a food court with Johnny Rockets open very late at night, some bad Chinese place, a bad pizza place, and a bad subs restaurant. But food isn't really a reason anyone stays here anyways.

I had only been to Vegas once before and stayed at Bally's but she had been there about 4 times already. Since neither of us had stated at the Flamingo, and since we had a good deal on the rooms, and since it was right in the heart of the strip we decided to book it.

We were not disappointed. Sure the rooms were a little outdated but we didn't spend much time sitting around our room. I do believe they are in the process of updating all their rooms to the Go Room style which will be nice.
 We were out exploring and seeing all that Vegas had to offer. And that's were the Flamingo shines. Sitting in the center of the strip makes it easy to get wherever you want go, plus it has it's own monorail stop which was awesome. I don't think there is a better location.

The grounds at the Flamingo are gorgeous. It's beautifully maintained with live flamingos and a pond with turtles and koi. Cute little Gazebos and two outdoor swimming pools. It's a nice place to take a morning walk and see the waterfalls and all the colorful flowers. 

The casino itself is cool because it's pretty open for the most part and you don't feel suffocated. There is no theme unless you count the color pink as a theme. The sportsbook is really just some seating and the counter\/screens\/big board. But really that's all I need while I'm there. I just usually put down a small bet then go about my day. I can't really sit still long enough to watch any sports so I just check the scores later.

We didn't eat at the buffet but Tropical Breeze Cafe was ok,  Burger Joint was pretty good, and Margaritaville was really good. We also got room service which was good as well. Also the little coffee\/sandwich\/breakfast counter was good and we utilized that quite a few times. Also last but not least was the Sin City Brewery. It was a convenient place for me to grab a cold one before heading out or heading back to the room.

The second time we stayed at the Flamingo was after we had decided to get married in LV. We checked out packages for all the hotels in our price range and ended up going with the Flamingo because of our previous experience and the beauty of the grounds. We had several family members and friends stay there too and everyone seemed to enjoy their stay.

The planning of the wedding couldn't have been simpler. We chose a package (I dream flamingos) and made a few choices and our flamingo wedding planner took care of the rest. Neither my wife or myself really wanted anything to do with a big wedding or picking out center pieces and that sort of stuff so it was perfect for us. 

Our wedding package was supposed to include an outdoor Gazebo ceremony but it literally started storming 10 minutes before our time and only lasted about 15 minutes. But we moved inside to stay dry and had the ceremony in a small chapel. It worked out great and apparently it's good luck to have rain on your wedding day in the desert.

The man who performed the ceremony was great. We asked for a non religious wedding and what he said was very sweet without being corny. He kept us loose and laughing and it was over pretty quickly without seeming rushed. The piano player was good too and performed the songs we picked out beautifully. 

Right afterwards we went out with the photographer they provided. We had purchased an extra hour with the photographer to make sure we would get enough pictures. We really happy we did because we got some really cool shots around the grounds. It really seemed like the perfect amount of time. We were also able to look at and pick out our pictures the next morning right at the Flamingo.

For the reception dinner we booked a party of about 25 at Margaritaville. It was an awesome dinner and I will review that separately. But everything (except the weather) worked out perfectly. We couldn't have been happier. I would easily recommend the Flamingo to anyone going to LV. The price, location, and service were all top notch. I know part of the fun of going to Vegas is staying at the different hotels, and I'm sure I will, but I will certainly stay at Flamingo again.",1,1,1

The lady on the phone told me the pet go rooms would be an additional 40 per night, so I booked\/upgraded the room. 

Now, online the rooms looked amazing. The GO rooms for pets were lush with all sorts of pet friendly amenities. 

The room they put us in had dirty stained carpets, the bedside lamp was missing a shade, there were candy wrappers under the beds, dirty ashtray in the drawer, missing glasses, corroded bathroom fixtures & a clogged sink. when I laid down to sleep the bedding smelled like someone had been chain smoking for weeks in the room. 

I won't stay here again. Its disgusting and I'm leaving early because of it. Blah, yuck",2,0,0

When we were there last time (2009) we had to haggle to get the room we had booked but overall enjoyed our stay. That is why we stayed there again this time. It was not as good. We did not get the room we had reserved and didn't bother to haggle, I'm at a point in my life where I'd just like to get what I paid for, if your not going to give it to me (and tell me I can possible switch rooms tomorrow) I'll just suck it up and not visit again. The room was dated, there was cheap but decent décor, but the room itself was junk. The price was great but I'd pay more to get what I want in a decent hotel. The food was really bad this time too and last time we really enjoyed it. There is a horrible sweet smell in that casino which drives me nuts too, it's gross. That overall is enough to make me not want to personally come back but I would have still recommended it for someone going to Vegas on the cheap if it was not for our last night. We were approached by a guy named Chandler in the hotel, telling us about a party that was going to be held in the Carlos and Charlie's restaurant and since we were guests we could have free drinks, he gave us a wrist band. When we came back later to the ""party"" we were told that we had to pay a $15 cover at the door but were given blue cups which would allow us to drink for free. We were seated at the bar when an older man in a suit came up and started yelling at my husband that he couldn't be drinking out of a blue cup, they were for ladies only. I said, fine it's mine. The guy went nuts! He got in my face and started yelling at me, cussing me out and spitting in my face. I was appalled, it was unbelievable. I asked the guy who he was, he yelled, I asked him if he was the manager, he said ""f you"" I asked him if he worked for the hotel and hey just yelled and cussed and spit. UNBELIEVABLE! I left my husband and girlfriend at the bar and went to the bell desk. I asked to speak with a manager. I told Kathy, the women at the desk, what had happened. She informed me that the party was being put on by a promotions company, not the hotel or the restaurant and that there was nothing the hotel could do. Really? That just seems like bad business. She suggested I tell security what was going on so there would be a record. I did this and the security guard said the same thing. I went back to the restaurant. At the door a young man said ""your boyfriend can't drink out of your cup"" (hubs had his own cup). I asked him who he was, trying to find out who's party this was. He was obviously trying to not give me any information or he honestly didn't know who he was. He first said he owned the party, then he said his company owned the party. Obviously I was confused so I kept asking, trying to figure out where to complain. He went back in forth several times first saying it was Carlos and Charlie's party then saying it was his and finally settling on his company owned it and his company was called Ulta. Because of this experience I'm not going back to the Flamingo. FYI, I hadn't even started drinking yet, so it wasn't one of those drunk people experiences. Crappy business for the hotel to let their guest get taken advantage of, but since they seem to do the same thing I guess they don't care about their guests at all at the Flamingo",1,0,0

We stayed here 12\/9-12\/12. 

The hotel and room were very clean and very nice. We got upgraded to a bigger room with a beautiful view. 

We had a problem with our card being double charged. We went to the front desk. They explained why and then they called our bank and got everything reversed so we got our money back*

Only critique would be they need to add more gambling options and do a little more updating. I would for sure stay here again!!!",0,0,0

We got there and it was actually ok. I mean, no it is not fancy or anything like that, but our room was a standard room, it was big enough, clean and housekeeping did a great job. We stayed there for two nights and our stay was very pleasureable. The downside was the pool, yes, it has pretty waterfalls, but it was wayyyyy too crowded and it looks like they will let anyone off the street in, since they do not ask for a room key?? Also, the pool was very dirty, a lot of drunken debris flowing about....We did not go back to the pool for the remainder of our stay....but overall the hotel deserves the three stars!",4,1,1

This is totally unexceptable. Additionally, we valet parked our luxury car and we think it was joy ridden. Car was filthy when returned. When were checking out they couldn't find it. Attendant drove us around in some other guests car to look for it. Took an hour at 7am???
This was a major breach of valet procedure. 
Valet manager was rude and said this could never happen. Upper management promised to review and report. They also just gave us the stone wall.
Avoid the flamingo hotel.
Relating to cars filthy condition..they offered a car wash (never given to us) which would be unusable for we were out of towners. How would you like to have an attendant drive me around for 20 minutes in your car with all your stuff in it. A less honorable man could have stolen stuff. Valet is important for my wife who is disabled, but never again will we visit this joint.
Manager said car was put in construction zone. That is why I could not be found in an hour. Finally..After waiting over an hour I found it not 50 yards from garage entrance... we felt it was being used as well and just dumped there.

Old Blue Eyes frequented this joint often with his Rat Pack and you can really tell age hasn't always been the kindest to the interior and design of this heirloom hotel & casino. However, if you can look past the cheesiness of some of the decorum and look more into the amenities this place has to provide, you'll see this is still one of the best budget hotels to stay in Vegas.

Exterior\/Interior - 2 stars

The glitz and glam of a former era still speaks loudly at the Flamingo. The tacky designs of aged light bulbs and over-the-top glitz just doesn't fit well with the ultra sleek and clean look of modern Las Vegas hotels. Walking outside and the facade hasn't aged well; walking inside and it's old school, and not in a good way. If all hotels & casinos were based off face value, the Flamingo would be the unpopular kid getting hit in the head with dodge-balls. Luckily, the Flamingo is more than looks.

Room - 4 stars

Walking through the casino floor you would expect the same tackiness to fill up the rooms of the hotel but the Flamingo did an excellent job of renovating their rooms. Dark stained laminate looking somewhat like wood is your floor. The rooms are spacious enough where you can easily fit in a party of 6 or 8 people comfortably. The water pressure in the shower is excellent and hot water is available within seconds. And most importantly, these rooms have some of the most excellent views out onto the Strip. When you see the gold of sunset slowly drip onto the Strip and neon lights bring the city to life, you fall mesmerized by that window view. It was my nightlight to sleep and captivated me more than anything I could find on TV.

Yet, there are downsides to this room. The laminate isn't exactly smooth all around. The lamps in the bathroom are rusty. The vent was crooked in the bathroom and the TV was way too small for the size of the furniture. Still, other than some minor things you honestly couldn't ask for more in a room.

Amenities - 3 stars

I'm going to include location into this part as well. If this entire section alone was based off location it would be 5 stars. The Flamingo is located right in the heart of the Strip (or at least where it matters). You are right across from Caesar's Palace, side-by-side with The Linq and The Cromwell and you can walk all the way to Wynn or the Cosmopolitan within 10 - 15 minutes. It really is a fantastic location; however, location isn't the only factor. As far as in house things like gym or just the casino itself, you'll find yourself drifting to other locations. Why stay and gamble at the Flamingo when you have much nicer casino floors 100 feet away? The gym itself is nothing more than a small room about the size of a store. In fact, it is squeezed right between a lingerie store and jeweler and since there are no doors for privacy if you're doing those incredible effective glute exercises, anyone walking by can see you sweating. Still, the Flamingo does have some cool amenities like seeing their flamingos out in the garden, exotic birds for show and tell near the buffet, and Center Cut is still one of the best steakhouses on the Strip, a hidden gem really.

Conclusion

In a time where EDM, day clubs, and the Buffet of Buffets exists, the Flamingo can feel like a remnant of the past. Still, with excellent location, gorgeous views of the Strip from your room, affordable prices, and a great steakhouse, as long as the Flamingo can continue to improve itself this hotel & casino ain't going nowhere.",7,1,3

Pros: 
- Location. Close to lots of places on the strip. Walkable to the Venetian for conference.
- Affordable.
- Rooms were decent! Very spacious. I did not have a great view, though, but I'm sure other rooms did.
- Casino. 
- Buffet
- Restaurants
- Flamingos! The wildlife section here is my favorite part. You can walk through and see bird and koi exhibits, feedings, photo ops. Plus the buffet can give you a view of some of the park.

Cons:
- My coworker hated this place. Thought it was really tacky and horrible. If you're picky like that and would rather pay a little more for elsewhere.",0,0,1

I love pink, so the room theme of pepto bismol all over did not annoy me. Showers were so cool and the heater light was pink which was unique! You could really tell they maintained and renovated the place since the bathrooms, furniture, and TVs all looked really new! I mean what do you expect it is hilton owned! Its nice no doubt, but if i was to pay for the room I'd much rather stay at the wynn where the whole hotel is new. Brownie points for the Flamingo for having real flamingos all around the garden area. I hope this hotel stays it's a classic and one of the very few originals of vegas left!",1,0,0
