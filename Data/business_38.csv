1. You don't want to pay an arm and a leg at the higher end, celebrity chef restaurants
2. You're losing but you don't want your S. O. or family to know it
3. You are broke, but you don't want to eat Mall food in either of the 2 food courts
4. The dinner show was sold out
5. Cheesecake Factory is your favorite restaurant
6. You want to stay close to the ""Wizard of Oz"" slot machines in hopes of getting one when it opens up
7. You are tired of walking from the Sands Convention center all the way to your room, so you stop here to rest and eat

The Grand Lux Cafe is a moderately priced, large and usually noisy restaurant at the hub of activity in the Venetian. It is between the room elevators, the escalators to the self-park parking garage, some shops, an information and ticket buying booth for shows, and the casino floor, and near the grand walkway to the lobby.

It has a large menu with something for everyone, with most entrees around $15 - $25.  Very much like the Cheesecake Factory, since this restaurant was designed by the creators of the Cheesecake Factory, that ubiquitous faux fine dining restaurant so popular with the suburban mall rat crowd.

Actually, I had a pretty good salmon entree here, well presented and not too expensive. The two Gin and Tonics helped my enjoyment. 

Service is slower, though, but you should be able to find something reasonably tasty to satisfy your poor, tired soul here in the town that wasn't built on winners.

I forgot to see what Cheesecakes they offer here.",11,8,10

They start you off with warm bread, and will refill it if you ask.   I order the Pasta Telephono, it's amazing with toasted bread crumbs on top.  It's a big portion, so share or don't eat the whole day in preparation!  I've also had the Caprese Salad and the Greek Salad - two of my favorites.

Yes, it's a Cheesecake Factory spinoff, but lunch is rarely more than $15 per head, and if you can find a better deal, please tell me because I think this place is a bargain.  If you're in a hurry, you can eat at the bar - they serve the full menu and you always get great service since the bartender is never more than a few steps away from you.  

The Venetian is too fancy for a buffet, so this is the only buffet you'll find in the entire hotel, and it's breakfast only.  It has a pretty nice variety of small muffins, bear claws, croissants, English muffins\/bagels\/toast, bacon, potatoes and a made-to-order omelet station.  The line can be pretty long, but those guys work pretty quickly.

Lots of the entrees come in a smaller lunch portion, and the service is always fantastic with drinks frequently refilled and servers coming to check on you.

I don't know if that's true now, places like Central at Caesars are certainly giving it a run for its money, as casinos are investing more thought and money into these 24 hour joints.  But, Grand Lux is certainly an excellent place to eat any time of day, and you'd be hard pressed to find better food in the middle of the night.

The menu is expansive, which is not surprising given that it's owned by the Cheesecake Factory folks.  Most sandwiches are a good bet in my experience; the club is a favorite of more than one visitor I've taken to Grand Lux.  The fries are good, but they are rarely seasoned.  The buffalo chicken spring rolls are a favorite of mine, whenever we get appetizers they get my vote.  They are made like traditional spring rolls, but with the buffalo and blue cheese flavor wing fans will like.  The Grand Lux Burger Melt is another menu item I've ordered more than once.  Served on grilled parmesan bread, it's a play on a patty melt.  Certainly not appropriate if you're looking for a light meal, but it's a great burger.

More than once, I've had the breakfast buffet in the morning.  It's very simple:  pastries, fruits, eggs, breakfast meats, potatoes, etc.  But, it's all fresh and hot, and they make omelets or hash browns to order.  I prefer my hash browns extra crispy, so they made some and brought it to the table.  Since Venetian doesn't have a buffet, this is a nice option in the morning.

Finally, I love the strawberry lemonade, but it's too sweet.  I get it without the sugar lining the rim, and that does the trick for me.

Service can be spotty during peak hours, but I've never had any major issues.",3,0,2

I wish I remembered what her name was but I gave her a very nice tip. It was about 10am and the person I was with said maybe we should share a meal and I agreed. I'm not a big fan of eggs Benedict but that's what we ordered. So when they came to the table the eggs weren't runny as they should be. 

I didn't want to send them back but my travel partner insisted and I thought sending them back was a bad idea. You never know what people will put in your food once you piss them off. We got the second eggs Benedict and one of them was runny, I didn't eat that one and the muffin was burnt. The waitress came and asked how the food was and we mentioned how the muffin was burnt. She apologized and left our table and told the manager.

Well long story short my travel partner vomited twice within an hour. So the moral of this review is be nice to your waiter and don't send your food back.

Little did we know that this restaurant (and it's sister at the Palazzo, is in the same family as CF). We ended up here several time during our stay due to various reasons.
Our first night here, we ended up having dinner due to the lateness of our check-in and simply being starving. We had a great waiter, and though the restaurant may be a sister to the CF, the menu is mostly different. The bread here is delicious and very crusty and basically a vehicle for butter. Great crust-and great butter. I ordred the four cheese pizza and added mushrooms and asked for the pizza to be cooked ""well done"".The husband ordered the chicken pot pie. When our meals arrived, the pot pie was in a GIANT bowl, covered with crust and my pizza was served Roman style (oblong not round) and was more chewy then I like. A few bites in, Kevin and I switched dishes. He loved the pizza as it was very flavorful, but texturally more to his liking. The pot pie had one of the most delicious crusts I have ever had, but the innards were kind of bland and boring. I had a crust and chicken dinner. We were too full for dessert.

The second time we came here was for dessert after the Jersey Boys where we learned that the dessert menu differs from the same restaurant in the Palazzo and our group was disappointed because we dined at the Grand Lux for dinner(at the P)and had our hearts set on certain desserts that weren't offered here. We did manage to order the strawberry shortcake (yummy) the key lime pie (good but afterwards a bit too tongue tart and the banana pudding with home made vanilla wafers. The wafers were the best part of this dessert, but the pudding itself was cloyingly sweet and our waitress wasn't too excited for our table of 6 only ordering dessert and water.

Our third and last time at this location was for lunch with 2 of my girlfriends from high school who flew in on my birthday day. They were starving and chose to come here since they were also staying at the Venetian. We came down a bit after they had been there and had already ordered.  I had the miso salmon (a staple order for me at the regular CF) and it was much better here than what I have had at any CF with more vegetables, no butter sauce and a little kick. Kevin had the lunch  size pepperoni pizza and salad and the pizza was actually small enough to fit on the same plate as the salad. I had a bit, it was too greasy for me, but that is because of the pepperoni. My friends' had a Cuban and a Carnitas sandwich both served with fries and they both loved what they ordered. 

Of course the meal was served with the good vehicle for butter and yes, I had my fill.

We stayed at the Venetian hotel and this was the only place that was open 24\/7 with great late night eats. The food court got tiring after so many visits. The menu is here is so extensive that you can try something new every time. We came in for lunch one day and many of us ordered their lunch special, such a great deal. For $10 bucks you can get a cup of soup, side salad, and half a sandwich. All my friends said they enjoyed what they ordered. I opted to pay $2 more for the side salad and half pasta combo. Even half of a regular pasta entrée was a lot for me to eat for lunch and I even had to take it to go. The Cabonara pasta is so tasty! Loaded with cream sauce, which I love, I hate dry pastas, it got a boost of flavor from the bits of bacon and green peas. Because it is Vegas, top off your meal with a cocktail! The Blood Orange Mojito is an excellent choice! The fries there are to die for. It seems so simple and so common a thing, but the fires there keep me coming back. Maybe there's a special oil that they cook them in because they have a richer and sweeter after taste. They're just ordinary fries, but dip it in a bit of ranch or ketchup and you'll be chomping away the whole plate of fries before you know it! Service here also never fails, always friendly and quick, despite it being super crowded all the time. I came back so many times the manager even remembered me. He called me ""Sloppy Joe Girl"" because one night I ordered it and he was happy I came back for more food. He even kept going back to the kitchen to check up on our take out order so we wouldn't be waiting so long. This makes up for the crappy cashier. He did however apologize to us and said that he was just having a bad day, but still, don't take it out on your customers, that's very unprofessional. One night we ordered a sloppy joe and the other night we ordered the chicken cream pasta with sun dried tomatoes for take out. The sloppy joe was nice and tangy with a sprinkle of chopped onions, so good! The meat was loaded with flavor, probably too salty alone, but when paired up with the long sandwich buns, it was a perfect balance. It also came with a side sauce of some orange tangy nature which I didn't care too much for. The chicken pasta was good, but probably not my favorite dish there so far. It didn't have as much cream sauce compared to the Cabonara that I liked and the grilled chicken was dry. It was a little hard to eat. It was a huge portion though, it fed like three of us girls!

Not my president. 
Not my restaurant pick. 

I came here because I was on a holiday trip with my mom and grandma and their taste in food... well, not mine. My mom wants burgers, and pasta, and very normal lower middle class American food. My grandma wants yogurt. Love them but going out to eat and trying new foods and dishes are my favorite thing on the planet and their dietary desires made me getting what I wanted not possible. 

Grand Lux Cafe is perfectly fine if you love meat. The menu, like Cheesecake Factory, is a zillion pages long, most things are chicken based but they have burgers, pasta, salads (most served with meat), and large dessert selection. The portions, again like Cheesecake Factory, are huge and shareable and all things considered, it's an affordable meal with really basic offerings. 

I was shocked that on a menu this large there were so few vegetarian options. That was so crazy to me. And I'm sure you can maybe modify some of the dishes to be sans chicken (the ingredient du jour in most things here), I'm not a fan of paying the premium for meat that I'm not getting. 

Service here, was actually very good. We wanted for nothing, they were on it with the refills and extra accoutrements for my grandma's hot tea. They didn't keep us waiting, they checked on us at appropriate intervals, it was overall very pleasant. 

My mom got some sort of massive burger and my grandma and I split a veggie burger (not your standard morning star crap, but actually a decent patty with the main base being farro) and a salad. The portions were huge on both. We probably could have just ordered one thing and split it considering they complimentary bread and butter they give you. I did not partake in the bread but my family seemed to enjoy it. 

The veggie burger was hearty, the fries that came with it were good. The salad had waaay too much dressing for a person who doesn't want to die of a heart attack. It could have been decent but the dressing amount just swamped it. The cheese on it was like the most basic pre-cut grocery store party platter bright orange and true white cheese. Not exactly artisan but it certainly helped to offset the acidic overpowering taste of the dressing. 

I'd also gotten a bowl of their minestrone, that was really good, but worth noting that I love salt and it was extremely sodium-rich and not for the faint of heart.

Overall, it's not the worst place you can go. In fact, it's perfectly fine and they're actually open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, which is a great quality for a restaurant in Vegas. Is it on my top 20 to-do list for Vegas? No. Is it on my Plan-B list for next time in case I can't get in anywhere else or happen to be with people with basic taste? Yes.",20,19,21

I've been to Cheesecake Factory plenty of times, and I felt that it was relatively over-priced for the measley portions they offer. However, Grand Lux shares just about the same menu, but pricing and portions are worth the cost.

While my friends and I were staying at the Venetian, Grand Lux Cafe was basically our go-to spot for food, regardless of time or circumstance, since of course it's open 24 hours. Incredibly convenient, especially for a city like Vegas!

I tried a couple different things I don't often order at restaurants, the Braised Yankee Pot Roast and the Veal Saltimbocca. 

Now, you can get pot roast just about ANYWHERE, but Grand Lux prepared it so well. Normally, at your run-of-the-mill restaurants, the Pot Roast description says ""slow-roasted until tender"" and ends up being all dry and chewy. Grand Lux's version was a different story; I could've sworn the meat was as tender as butter and as savory as can possibly be. The vegetables were fresh and buttery, though I wasn't too fond of the yams. (Not a yam guy, so sue me.)

The Veal Saltimbocca was pretty much like a Chicken Cordon Bleu, but with a nice twist. The veal was done just right and the prosciutto and Fontina cheese complimented it well. Throw in a well-balanced mixture of Parmesan breadcrumbs and herbs and you've got a classic mainstay dish on your hands. The angel-hair pasta with wine sauce grounded out the dish very well, though I personally thought it was a little too oily.

I believe Grand Lux is one of those restaurants you just have to stop by if you're ever in Vegas, especially since it's open 24 hours. So whether you need some food to sober up after partying a little too hard at Tao, or would like a nice breakfast to talk over plans of the day with friends, I highly recommend Grand Lux Cafe!

When we headed in, the restaurant was a bit dark, with a very comfortable atmosphere. The service, however, was decent but not really great. They were cordial, but not very attentive or friendly, which I suppose was fine since we were more interested in talking to each other anyway. 

To start with, the drinks aren't bad at all. There was always something good to drink, at pretty standard prices. 

The food is actually mostly decent as well. We tried some dinner\/lunch food such as burgers and also a chili dog meal, and they were okay, though perhaps not the best. The desserts, however, were absolutely wonderful. Our favourites were the creme brulee (I'm a huge creme brulee lover, so getting to try two was pretty nice) and the beignets, which were amazing.

Fortunately, we stumbled on the Grand Lux Cafe. Seated immediately, in large cozy booths, and promptly delivered a large boat of a margarita, I couldn't help but sigh in contentment. Have you ever been to one of those places where the cost is just above the price for casual food, and the food has such high aspirations that it ends up falling flat? Well this isn't that place. You pay a little more at the Grand Lux Cafe, but you get a lot more in terms of food, service and atmosphere. 

The servings here are gynormous. Yes, gynormous. The fried calamari was delicious, especially with the shrimp mixed in, and honestly would have been filling enough to call it a light meal for two people. The BLT was huge, with heaps of crisp, delicious bacon finding their way straight to my heart (and hips). One person in our group got a deli sandwich and asked how much meat it came with. After asking to leave half of it off, she still could barely fit the sandwich in her mouth. And the fish and chips? Let's just say there would have been enough for about 2 and a half meals. 

The service was great as well, friendly, unpretentious and quick. But what impressed me was, despite it being so late, and the Grand Lux clearly having a late night menu, our server told us we could order anything we wanted from the main or late night menu.

In any case, I came here for a late lunch one time, and I ordered what I expected to be a light snack - Asian Nachos - but as it turns out, the portions were HUGE.

The Asian Nachos consisted of crispy fried wontons covered with chicken in a sweet-hot peanut sauce that was topped with Wasabi cream and melted cheese...and on top of that, there was fried rice in the middle of the dish. MMM....this dish was pretty yummy!!

In addition to the nachos, I also had a Spicy Calamari Salad which consisted of crispy calamari, organic greens, carrots, cucumber and green onions tossed with a delicious spicy vinaigrette!!

Therefore, it was very salty. I would advise you to ask that they not top off the salad with salt and if you also prefer, dressing on the side. I found this out wehn the manager came by to apologize after I asked if they could make me another salad with less dressing. The dressing was fine it was the extra salt.

(Delectably Smooth and Silky. One Classic Vanilla and the other 
Deep Chocolate. Finished with a Crunchy Sugary Top) mmmmm mmmm good!!!
I also recommend the New Orleans Beignets (Served Warm with Three Sauces) it is sooooo good, but get ready to share cause there's enough for 2 to 4.

So the next time your in Vegas be sure to hit up the Grand Lux Cafe!",1,1,1

Two in the party went for the breakfast sandwich, it was stuffed with ham,bacon,scrambled eggs, cheese on thick cut toasted bread. They devoured them like finger food. I had the Manhattan salad with shrimp and chicken. It looked better then it tasted. I'm not sure what it was missing but I wouldn't order it again.

It took us a while to decide what we wanted since the menu had a big variety. I guess that's why the website says ""something for everyone!"" So true!

We finally decided upon the Crispy Caramel Chicken because it just sounded so good! ""Crispy Battered Pieces of Chicken Breast in a Spicy Thai Caramel Sauce with Mushrooms, Onions, Red Chile Peppers, Garlic and Ginger. Served with Rice.""

The calamari came and it wasn't just calamari. It also came with Rock Shrimp, Zucchini and Onions. Served with a couple dipping sauces. It was all so crunchy, just the way I like it! I loved that they added in the shrimp, zucchini, and onions. It made it all the more better!

The caramel chicken came and we were ecstatic! IT looked just as it was described in the menu, maybe even better! Our first bites had us melting in our seats, it was so tasty!

The food is always consistent and the prices are reasonable. I've been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner before. Each time I leave with a happy stomach and money left in my pocket. There's a lot of variety on the menu. I enjoy having the omelettes during breakfast and the average price is around $13. Some fast food places at the food court charge more than that. Lunch averages around $20 and dinner is around $30. 

The other day I tried out the Caramel Chicken and it was delicious. The chicken had a nice crisp to it and the sauce went really well with the white rice. In my opinion, almost everything on the menu is acceptable. The burgers are good. The omelettes in the morning are tasty. I always have trouble ordering because everything sounds tasty.

Some were too drunk to continue the night, while others (including myself) held it together and carried on! I had the pleasure of staying at The Venetian, so we thought... Why go out to The Strip where it's incredibly hot? So we started looking... 

I'm not a big fan of going to sit-down places in Vegas; I really don't see the point. But the food court only had two places open - none of which seemed appealing. Luckily, a worker of the Venetian walked by us, so I (probably drunkly) walked up to her and asked if there were any other places that we could eat. She was really nice, pointed at Grand Lux, and said, ""It's REALLY good."" I was sold. 

We walk in (party of four) and are immediately seated. Our server is VERY nice and attentive - and please keep in mind this was around 3 am - so I really doubt he wanted to be there. I forgot his name, but the guy was awesome. 

Onto food: We ordered the BLT sandwich, someone else ordered a burger, and per the servers recommendation, someone ordered Asian nachos (AMAZING, btw). I ordered the Bacon-Cheese burger(!!!!!). 

The Asian nachos were freaking amazing... They're made with crispy friend wontons, covered with chicken, sweet peanut sauce, and wasabi cream and melted cheese! The plate comes with about ten of them, and we were all able to get one and enjoy it. It's just crispy goodness! Very yummy. 

My Bacon-Cheese burger was freaking good. I just reviewed GR's BurGR, and I was really unimpressed with the service and food. My burger was a disappointment. Luckily, I had come to the GLC the night before, so this burger was still on my mind. I ordered it well done, and it was made perfectly. It's ANGUS beef with crispy bacon, melted American cheese, grilled onions, and mayo. I really recommend it! I was starving, and yet, I couldn't even finish it. It was huge! The fries that it came with were meh, but nothing a little ranch can't fix. 

Overall, I can recommend this place for lunch or at least for the Asian nachos and burger that I ordered. The service was GREAT, but the time it took to get our food was a bit long... No matter.

We went for her birthday with the Oh so fabulous birthday gift certificate they give all employees and I bet they are regretting now cuz we went BANANAS!

We started with the biggest appetizer on the menu, The Grand Appetizer Platter,  which featured a little bit of everything.  This appetizer is enough for 6 people, no joke.... Spinach Artichoke Dip (tasty), Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls( ok), Duck Potstickers(tasty), Buffalo Chicken Rolls(not so tasty), Cheese Steak Spring Rolls (not so tasty) and Vietnamese Chicken Summer Rolls(the chicken was super dry and this is the 2nd time we've tried them).

We then shared the Mongolian Beef which was really good, served with pita bread and rice. Why 2 starches? Beats the heck out of me.

Then the staff was so nice to let us go see Jersey Boys and come back after the show to enjoy the Strawberry Shortcake. I love strawberries, i really do. But there was nothing special about the shortcake. Just typical, but still good.

My roomate will sometimes bring home other deserts which are WAY better. So way better they get to the point of craving status...Warm Banana Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding is my all time favorite and the Roasted Pineapple Upside Down Cake is also very very good and they are all big enough to share.

We arrived in Vegas pretty late and we found out that Lux is the go-to restaurant for late food without having to stroll down the strip. The restaurant was actually really hard for us to find because we entered through the Palazzo and didn't know there was two and wandered off to the Venetian one, which people say is the better one. It turns out, if you enter through the Venetian front entrance, it's to your right, past the Bellini Bar and right next to JuiceFarm. It definitely reminded me of an upgraded version of Cheescake factory with a dimmer environment but better food and service. Their menu is just as big as the Cheesecake menu and it took me awhile to figure out what type of food I wanted to eat before I asked for recommendations. Because we came late, we didn't have to wait to get seated but I was still surprised how busy it was for a weekday afterhours. 

They gave us complementary bread that was right out of the oven to start while we looked over our menu. The waiter was able to give us pasta selections because we wanted something heavy before we passed out after the long drive. I ended up getting the Sunday Night Pasta, which was delicious. The noodles were how I liked it, the meat sauce had really good chunks of beef short rib, and there was just enough parmesan to top it off. My mom got the Lemon Chicken Piccata and it was really disappointing. The sauce was too salty and the chicken was really dry.

The boys always order their chicken and waffles and they said it was the best as always and hit the spot. I'm a salad whore so of course I get a salad which was also delish!

Same story with my latest visit.  I had the pasta carbonara and the sauce was good, a bit bland and the pasta was a bit overcooked.  However, the bf LOVED the fried spring rolls that you roll in lettuce.  Kinda a hybrid between egg rolls and lettuce wraps.  I have to admit, it was good.

Weird part.  I made a friend at my table.  There was a little ant crawling around.  He wanted some of my pasta and since I didn't finish it myself, I gave him some.  Sadly, he drowned in the oil.

But anyway, I decided to check it out as our last lunch\/meal in Vegas before we had to board the shuttle. It was a Saturday afternoon, and the rush of people on the streets was insane, so it took us a good 20 minutes or so to get to the Venetian. I love that hotel so much - so gorgeous, but we didn't have any time to explore, so we rushed over to the Grand Lux (very easy to find) and got seated right away. It's a very big restaurant, with plenty of seating and a very ""grand"" and beautiful interior, but it was PACKED! 

With the little time that we had left, my boyfriend and I rushed through the menu and he ended up getting the Buffalo Chicken Rolls and I got the Spicy Flat bread Chicken sandwich - very good! My only concern was that the food took forever, so we literally had 10 minutes to eat and we had to go right away. The doggy bag came into good use when our plane was delayed for 5 hours... 

Anyway, this place reminds me so much of Cheesecake Factory, but that makes a lot of sense considering it's the same owners. With that being said, the menu is endless, so I will def be making my way back here next time I am in Vegas.

They have a variety of pastas, burgers, pizzas. We had their pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom pizza which was pretty big for $13 the pepperoni was a bit salty, but I thought it was really delicious.

-the clam chowder was total fail. not only was it lukewarm, it was devoid of any flavor, clam or otherwise, and just tasted like watered down cream. 
-vietnamese fried spring rolls were pretty good
-chicken lettuce wraps came with a HUGE bowl of filling. we had to ask for more iceberg lettuce because we ran out 1\/4 of the way through the bowl. the flavor was decent although on the salty side.

The server was extremely friendly to us considering we had a big group (my family and I). She took our drink orders down and carded almost all of us minus the parentals. She even carded my oldest brother who is waaaay above the drinking age. I guess he just looks that young. 

I ordered the Short Rib Grilled Cheese Sandwich. It came with french fries. It wasn't that bad actually. But it wasn't my favorite. It was pretty greasy but I guess most sandwiches with a name like that tends to be on the greasier side.

My brother ordered the Crispy Caramel Chicken and it was so so good. He let me try some and immediately I wanted to trade with him. It was so delicious.

Came here with a group of 11 girls and they sat us in two separate tables.  We found the space in between a little too dividing so we pushed the tables together.  Why didn't they give us a table big enough for everyone is beyond me (this place is huge so I'm assuming they have a table for 11 somewhere and if they don't, they need to make one like we did). The menu was extensive - very similar to cheesecake factory both in number of dishes offered and the types of dishes offered.  If I didn't know any better, I'd say the two are affiliated.  

The portions of the food are large! Definitely big enough for two.  So if you don't want left overs or don't want to fall into a food coma, you should definitely share.  So kuddos on the portions.  The service, however, could have been a lot better.

i couldn't stop drooling while reading the menu. there's a LOOOOT of choices, and it was hard to choose. i decided to go for one of their ""lunch specials,"" a lunch portion of pasta (choice of pasta pomodoro, pasta fresca or pasta telephono) and a small house salad.

I asked for my usual, virgin piña colada, and my aunties each asked for a cup of coffee.  Our drinks arrived and we were trying to place our food order, which we were indecisive about so Debbie was very patient with us.

I decided on the crab cakes to start off our meal and it was delicious!!  I don't think I have ever had any crab cakes that are that good, even my aunties agreed--saying that they weren't even that hungry to begin with.

I decided to order the ahi ceviche as my main entree.  It was very refreshing & filling, yet not heavy at all.  Although, it got really sour towards the bottom because the lime juice must have all sunken to the bottom of the serving glass.

Auntie Ann had the salmon & lox and that wasn't too bad either.  Although, the salmon was a tad on the salty side...but still tasty nonetheless.

Auntie Bev went with the deep fried calamari as her main dish and we all thought that was very well executed as well.  The batter was crispy and fried to a golden perfection.  It had a few deep fried bay shrimps and veggies as well.

We ended our meal by sharing a creme brûlée, which was divine...considering we claimed we weren't too hungry yet ate everything and still had room for dessert.  My virgin piña colada was excellent as well.

What carne asada fries are to drunks in San Diego and what Paisano's Pizza is to drunks in Hermosa Beach, Grand Lux is to drunks in Vegas.  

The beauty of this place though is that it is for classy drunks and not even for only drunks.  The food: perfection.  They have THE BEST Chicken Parm I've ever had. They use a number of different types of cheeses that add to the tastyness of it.  They also lighly bread the chicken making it more tasty.  Unlike other places where all you taste is fried batter.  You get the flakeyness and deliciousness of the breading here with the juicyness of the chicken.  Now let's move on to the next entree...shall we?

If you order Buffalo ______ at Grand Lux, it's a safe bet to be amazing.  Anything Buffalo is good here. Their buffalo chicken roll appetizers are some of the best appetizers I've ever had and their spicy buffalo chix sandwich just adds to the buffalo goodness.  Sometimes I order both and I may get a look from the waiter recognizing my buffalo filled meal, but all that subsides after the first bite.  Now to breakfast...

I tried their breakfast buffet here for the first time 2 weeks ago, and it was $15.95 and it included juice.  Very good breakfast selection of eggs, bacon, omelette station, fruit, waffles, etc.  The only thing missing was pancakes.  What i did though was made a nice dessert out of the waffles by taking some hot waffles and adding some of the chocolate chips they have laying around and put a nice dose of whip cream on top.  And if I'm feeling good, add some fruit.  They also have hash browns, which were some of the BEST hash browns I've ever had.  They weren't dry at all.  It was just great.

The fried chicken tasted like it had been sitting in the warmer for a few hours, the macaroni and cheese was really bland and dry on top (my boyfriend recommended that I dig into the middle parts to not have to eat the stale pieces on top-- I shouldn't have to do that!!), and the Salisbury steak tasted like it had just come out of a frozen food box.

Getting diners in and out with efficiency is something they've mastered. I was impressed when we dropped in for a late breakfast\/lunch Saturday afternoon. Located smack in the middle of The Venetian, the line was out the door. Luckily, we only waited about 5 minutes before being led to a table. 

Rumor has it that Grand Lux is affiliated in some respect to The Cheesecake Factory. I'm not sure if that's totally accurate.. Whether or not that's true makes no difference to me because I am a Cheesecake Factory fan!

At any rate, I opted to be good and order a Turkey Club Sandwich. Unfortunately, I also acquiesced to their offer of a bread basket. The bread was nice, reminiscent of Cheese Cake Factory bread. It was damn delicious. My Turkey Club was also nice. It had fresh tomato and thick cuts of bacon. Bread was chewy and perfection. 

My lunch companion opted for the breakfast buffet for $18. They will cook you a custom-made omelet. Hash browns, sausages, bacon, pastries and scores of other goodies are also available. Likely a good deal, especially if you have a good appetite and want multiple servings. But I was trying to be good, and was happy with my Club Sandwich. Although, admittedly, my lunch companion brought me a side of hash browns from the buffet. So, in retrospect, I guess I wasn't really that good.

The service was really good and friendly. The sour dough bread with vinegar and olive oil is a great appetizer to start off with and it's free. This place is owned by Cheesecake Factory, but it's a step up in quality and price. 

Positives: 
The appetizers are just as good as an entree lol . We had some shrimp and fried calamari. The fried calamari came in a huge portion and it really filled us up. We didn't even finish it. 

The entree that I had was Fish and Chips. I know that you can never go wrong with Fish and Chips, and I was right about the quality of it. It was 4 nice big pieces of Alaskan Cod with fresh hot fries. Their Buffalo Wing Chicken wrap is good too. 

Negatives:
It did take quite a bit of time for our food to come, but they did come at one time. My brother's filet mignon was kinda well done rather than medium like he wanted, but they did offer to take it back and re-do it but we were in a hurry. The price is what it is in terms of a fancy restaurant, but hey, it's Vegas and you want to eat like kings.

First of the hostess was not very welcoming. I never really pay attention to stuff like that but I came a long way from walking around the grand canal shoppes. I was ready to get seated.  One waiter got our drinks right away and ten minutes later a nice waitress took our order.  We ordered crispy calamari, the beef wellington and shrimp scampi. 

They gave us a basket of bread and butter. Of course I dig right in. This bread was the worst bread I have ever had. Do not get me wrong, the flavor was there but the crust of the bread was so tough! I could barely chew it! It seemed like old bread that has been reheated. 

The calamari was a 30 minutes wait but it was good. Not the best I have had but good.  The main entrees took another 30 minute wait. I was a bit agitated at this point but I was happy about how the food looked.  

The shrimp scampi was okay.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and the shrimp was yummy!  The sauce on the pasta was way too sour.  I was not a big fan and neither was my boyfriend. 

The beef wellington had a side of rainbow carrots, Brussel sprouts, and mashed potatoes.  The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare. It had a very good flavor but sadly it was way too salty. I couldn't finish eating the second cut of steak. I never usually complain about the dish but I could not take how salty it was. I was downing so much water because my mouth was getting dry. I was highly disappointed with my meal.

I give one star for the kind waitress. The wait and food quality was not her fault whatsoever.  I give a second star because the sides on the beef wellington was really good! They were all cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes were to die for.  And the shrimp on the pasta was also delicious.

Although the entree was good, the dessert wasn't as up to par. My sister went with the chocolate molten lava cake served with vanilla ice cream. It was presented beautifully. However, the ice cream was extremely frozen to the point where you had to struggle just to get a spoonful. Fudge exploded from the middle just the way it should be, but there was barely any cake.

We had to try the chili because it was made with short ribs and freakin' kobe ground beef.  Hard to pass up.  It was good but ridiculasly salty.   Also tried the patty melt on parmesan bread.   TOO greasy... even for a hangover... but if you like that sort of thing, get after it.

Let me preface that my nine friends and I came to this hole as a collectively quiet and borderline hungover group at around 5AM after a looong night. That is to say, we weren't even close to our usual rowdy level, but actually resembled a group of elderly men and women who were REALLY, REALLY SORE AND HUNGRY.

We stumbled to the front desk to ask for seating for nine. There was no one there. We waiting for another couple minutes, searching for someone to help us and found a couple of the wait staff helping other tables (there were probably a total of five occupied in the whole place) and a few people chatting near the back. Once someone noticed the huge scattered group, they ambled over to ask what they could do for us. As if it wasn't obvious already, we asked for a table for nine. The hostess told us to wait while they could find an open table and the wait would be around 10-15 minutes. Seriously? As we waited patiently yet astounded, we saw her and a few people walking around... I assumed they were setting up a table large enough for us but wondered why it could possibly take so long with no one else waiting and hardly anyone dining. 

After what felt like an eternity in Vegas time, we were sat at a banquet-style table (how hard could that have been to put together if it took any time at all?) with menus dropped off at the edge of the table for us to pass down to each other. The waiter left. He came back to ask what we wanted to drink. We said, waters, please. The waiter left. When he came back, he sloppily poured us all waters and left some of us with half-empty glasses. After asking us if we were ready to order five times in just as many minutes, he didn't come back at all. We had to flag down a DIFFERENT waiter to take down our simple-as-it-gets breakfast orders. Once that was all situated, it was purely a waiting game. 

10 minutes went by... 20... 30... by 40, everyone had forgotten why we were even there and I was straining to find ANYONE who worked in the place to ask where the F our food was. As if they decided it was long enough, by 50 or 60 minutes, our food showed up. Eggs, bacon, sausage, etc. You'd think with that kind of preparation time they could also get these beginner dishes right. Some dishes came with extra sides of meats that were never ordered but would later be charged e$$$tra; some came without the sides they were promised; and one or two dishes were forgotten altogether.

When the bill came just as late as the food, we realized we had been had. The cheap dishes were almost doubled the cost on the menu bc the waiter never informed us of how much a side of three slices of bacon would cost, and some extras were brought out even without our consent. But we were over it. So, so over it. We paid the bill and left just as quietly as we came. Though I really wish we would have just dined and dashed (which is something my friends and I do not have the heart to do but it seemed so appropriate at the time).

Never again.",4,2,2

I notably remember the Shaky Beef with rice plate (which is Vietnamese Com Bo Luc Lac) and it was simply amazing, better than most Vietnamese restaurants I've been to (and I'm Vietnamese)!

What you are about to read is detailed.  You may want to turn away now especially if you absolutely love Grand Lux.  My friend Yin was set on going to the Grand Lux location at the Venetian.  We probably should've gone to a buffet instead.

A haggard server took our orders and pleasantly answered our questions.  She suggested a vinagerette on the side since I wasn't sure about whether I would like it or not.  Omelette and Hash Browns, two Pasta Carbonaras, Fried Chicken and Waffles (Boneless fried chicken and one Belgian Waffle - why it's plural on the menu is misleading) and Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Jambalaya.  She even recommended lunch portions of our Carbonaras because they serve HUGE portions.

They switched servers to a perky young lady who seemed eager to take our order.  Sharida was her name, I believe, and she had curly hair.  She was taking over for the previous lady.  We were glad to have her.

After about 15 minutes, the first server surprisingly came back with the duck potstickers (delicious by the way) and a boat of my salad dressing.  In addition, a scalding hot loaf of sliced sourdough bread came a few minutes later.  Within this time, Grand Lux Cafe seats about six guys with luggages by their side to my right.  Soon thereafter, a family of five sits to my left.

15 minutes after getting our appetizers and bread...

The table of six guys gets their order of cold sandwiches and other quick-fix dishes.  ""Hmmm..."" we think to ourselves.  ""They get their order before us but they sat later.  At least we got our potstickers and bread to tide us over.  Besides, it probably takes quicker to fix their lunch than ours does.  What am I going to do with this salad dressing without salad though?""  They take our appetizer plate and small dishes away.  

20-minute mark from the time they delivered our appetizers...

25-minute mark...

The family to my left gets their orders.  I noticed some had fried chicken, others pasta, still others, hot and tasty dishes.  Okay, something was seriously wrong.

30-minute mark..

35-minute mark..

I try to flag down our waitress who went from one of the bar tables and goes to six-guy table to my right and asks if everything came out alright.  I try to catch her attention through her peripheral vision, but she clearly makes her way to the kitchen.  

40-minute mark..

My cousin gets up and seeks out our waitress.  He follows her, calls out, but according to him she ignored him and bolted for the kitchen.  The two ladies at the end of the bar simply tell him, ""You don't look so happy.""

""I'm not,"" he says, but with a smile because they're girls.  He was hiding his frustration.  He sits back down with us.

45 minutes after getting our appetizers...

All of us are so hungry and waiting there.  I lost my appetite.  Our drinks aren't even filled.  My cousin says, ""Let's get out of here.""  I on the other hand didn't want to leave without at least paying for the potstickers.

""Let's just leave,"" he repeats standing up.  ""I don't need this.  We should just go somewhere else.  Clearly the other tables got their food and we didn't.""  He pointed out the bar area also got their food right away.  I was beginning to suspect a number of different factors as to why we didn't get ours, but I had enough of it too.  I stood up too looking around for any server.  Yin makes her way to the hostess to try and flag a manager.  My brother stands up. Our table is empty.  Just as the last of our friends agrees and stands up ready to leave, several food servers come out with our dishes.

The cheese on our carbonara was dried and hard from the prolonged heat.  The fried chicken wasn't fresh.  The waffle was on the verge of being burnt.  The omelette looked rubbery.  In spite of it all, I liked my creamy pasta and I think the bacon saved it.  I just had to move the cheese.  I was so upset I only ate half of it and didn't enjoy it as much as I could've had it been fresher earlier.  You can *definitely* tell all of our food had been sitting out for a while.  Salad greens were wilted and had dark spots and tomatoes were mushy.

The manager, Marty, kept asking how she could make it up to us...crap 5000 word limit-

We understand restaurants tend to get busy especially during Sunday mornings and afternoons in Vegas, but clearly, there was some miscommunication between servers and the kitchen.  Maybe it was Sharida's first day.  There are legitimate reasons as to why service (albeit friendly) was abhorrent.  Our server could've at LEAST periodically come by with a status.

I've never ever come across service like this.  I guess it was bound to happen sooner or later.  I'd go back to Grand Lux Cafe out of mercy, but never will I set foot at this location again.

Grand Lux Cafe is under the same ownership as Cheesecake Factory, so the atmosphere and the menu are similar in some ways.

FOOD. My favorite items here are...
Pasta Carbonara with Chicken - Wow. I thought I've had good carbonara in the past, but that was until I've had theirs. Not only are their portions HUUUUUGE, but the pasta was so delicious! It was extremely cheesy, saucy and full of chicken. It was the most perfect carbonara I've had.
Southern Fried Chicken - my #1 favorite item here!!!! I order this most times that I go. It's half a chicken, breaded in this amazing batter and deep fried to perfection. It's served with mashed potatoes and peanut cole slaw. It is so good. KFC got nothin' on this. Seriously, it's amazing. It's enough for two people, too.
Cream of Chicken & Mushroom Soup - This soup is the bomb. Just trust me on this.
Deep Dark Fudge Cake - One of my favorite chocolate cakes I've had, ever. It is rich and extremely chocolatey. A must try if you come here!

PRICE. Not too shabby, compared to other Vegas restaurant prices. The servings are huge so you get your money's worth for sure.

SERVICE. This is where they lost a star. The service I received on my most recent visit was sub par. Our waiter was M.I.A. most of the time, failed to refill our drinks and bread basket, and took forever bringing us what we asked for. The restaurant was busy when we got there, but the crowd died down after a while. I understand these waiters are juggling a bunch of tables at once, so no complaints were made. It just would've been nice to have quicker service. Not to mention, it took thirty minutes for our food to come out! Yikes!
I usually order over the phone and just pick it up to eat in my hotel room. I highly recommend that. The service is quick and you get to eat in bed (score!).

So I jumped to eat hear the next time I came to Las Vegas.  Was here for lunch on a weekday between Christmas and New Years and was seated rather quickly near the bar area.  The waitress explained the offerings were large and there were lunch portions available.  I ordered the Strawberry lemonade and Hot Brown.  My friend ordered the Pasta Del Sol and a Spicy Bloody Mary.   For an appetizer we ordered the Fried Shrimp, Calamari, and Vegetables.

Drinks came out and Strawberry lemonade came out a bit sweet and I had to water it down with some water.  The Bloody Mary tasted nice and spicy and no hint of booze!

The appetizer came out quick and it certainly was enough for 4 as an appetizer.  Eat this quick as it will get greasy towards the end.

The waitress checked up on us and said the mains should be ready and after a small delay they came out.

My Hot Brown which is an open faced turkey sandwich on thick toast with cheese sauce was larger than expected and served separately with a side of fries.    The sauce was very rich and was slathered over the entire plate.  I had to dig into the bread and fries to cut the richness of this cheesy sauce.

I cannot comment on the Pasta as I only had a small bite.

Service was exceptional as the drinks and water were refilled well and the waitress even help box the rest of the uneaten Pasta Del Sol.  

When asked for dessert, we declined, but the waitress did mention that they were open 24 hrs.

i went to the one at Venetian....

after a night of drinking and partying up at Tryst, we were all craving for some Pho....yes....PHO! and knowing there probably isnt a vietnamese restaurant open at 4am, we decided to come here becuz we knew they had a dish that was similar to pho. its called Zen Noodles. it was actually pretty good. although they didnt give us enough broth, more noodles and chicken which i thought was quite strange. and when we asked our server to give us more broth, she said she will see if anyone else ordered the same dish and if the chef has extras. i guess they dont just have a big pot of broth in the back ready for the next order. but luckily they did have more for us.

we also had the vietnamese spring rolls which were absolutely delish!!! and we totally killed the basket of warm sourdough bread they gave us too! the only gripe i have is that the bowl of noodle soup cost $13! oh well! i guess when youre drunk and hungry, you'll pay just about any amount to satisfy your cravings!",0,0,0

- Yeah, Grand Lux Cafe's evil twin sister restaurant is The Cheesecake Factory.  But, what this means for you, gentle reader, is a hearty, ""American-sized"" meal.  You won't go hungry here.
- Not only are the portions generous, the food is DANG GOOD.  It might be reminiscent of The Cheesecake Factory, or even Mimi's Cafe.  But, it's consistently good.  REALLY good.  Comfort foods galore.
- And, good comfort food is even better after a hard night of hardcore partying.  For all your alcoholics out there (particularly from California), don't front - you know y'all head to Denny's or Jack In The Crack or Mel's because really junky, greasy food tastes even better at 3am and when you're trying to sober up.  Well, the food at Grand Lux Cafe is several notches above Denny's, Mel's and Jack In The Crack.  AND, this place is open 24:7.  Even better.

Service - Excellent - See below
Cleanliness - Excellent - it's in the Venetian so the place was pristine.
Price - $94.14 (including tax and tip, 3 people ordered)
Seafood - Yes, Calamari, ahi, etc.
Meats - Yes, beef, chicken, pork, duck, etc.
Vegetables - Yes, salads
Dessert - Yes, variety of cakes, pies, cupcakes, etc
Fruits - Yes
Other - (1) Located on the First Floor of the Venetian Casino floor between the Casino Cages and Food Court, (2) Review is for Venetian-side Grand Lux Cafe--not Palazzo-side.  (3) Grand Lux Cafe was created by David Overton (founder of Cheesecake Factory Restaurants), (4) Accept all major credit cards

What was ordered:

Customer Service (Complimentary) - Excellent - Jessica K was our server for this Wed 11:30 pm dining session.  Jessica was very personable and made great small talk about why we were here.  I was taking pictures of my friends and she offered to take a picture of me as well.  I declined, but she snatched my camera and proceeded to take my picture stating that I got pictures of my friends so it was only fair that I get a picture as well.  Jessica then offered to take a picture of all 3 of us afterwards.  Other than that, brought us everything we needed with a smile.  Nice gal.

Rib Eye Steak ($30.95) - Excellent - Cooked medium rare rib eye steak served with 2 onion rings, sprig of greens, and French fries.  Let me deconstruct the meal while I deconstruct the meal:

Rib Eye Steak - Excellent - Per Grand Lux Cafe menu ""We serve the finest Certified Angus Beef, corn-fed and aged up to 4 weeks for flavor, then seasoned and broiled at 1600 degrees to seal in the juices.""  Quantity: Nice, large slab of meat.  Approximately 9 inches in length, 4.5 inches in width, and 1 inch in thickness.  Quality: Excellent.  The steak came with some fat, but it was quite meaty--I ate the fat because it's delicious (don't judge).  They cooked it to perfection with a nice pinkish middle and still juicy.  The steak pretty much melted in your mouth like butter.  Flavor: I don't know how else to describe it, but as ""Awesome and delicious!""  Very flavorful beef that I was tempted to order another.  Other: My friend M ordered the same thing, but cooked medium.  He could not stop ""ooo"" and ""aaaahing"" about the steak.  He even declared it the best steak ever.

(2) Onion Rings - Excellent - Quantity: 2 onion rings.  Quality: The BEST ONION RINGS EVER!!  The skin was perfectly golden with a nice crunch yet light when you bite into it--with very little oily feel.  I hate fast food places, chains, mom & pops serve these onion rings that have hard crusts and extremely oily.  Flavor: You really can taste the onion goodness here--it isn't hidden by the batter.  So good.

Sprig of Greens - Excellent - Quantity: A sprig.  Quality: I'm amazed about the attention to detail here.  If you think this sprig of greens is just garnishment, think again.  They actually put dressing on these greens--meant for consumption, not looks.  Think of it as a mini, mini, mini salad.  Flavor: Great flavor--sweetness and citrus acidity pop from the dressing and refreshing flavor from the greens.  The greens actually refreshes your mouth after consuming such bold flavors from the beef.

French Fries - Excellent - Quantity: Approximately a 5 inch diameter bowl of fries--4 inches in height.  Quality: Nice golden brown color, perfectly crispy, and not oily.  Flavor: Tasted like good fries.  Seasoned well with a nutty flavor to them.

Let me check off my Las Vegas Checklist:

(1) Buffet - Nope - maybe Thursday morning
(2) Gamble - Hell NO - I despise losing money
(3) Club\/Adult Entertainment\/Events - Check - My Sac Kings lost to the Lakers.  Not going to make it rain this time.
(4) Drink\/Getting crazy loaded - Check - Gentleman Jack is your FRIEND. http:\/\/media1.px.yelpcdn.com\/photo\/yZI0fAgC2XtddriDX2i3rA\/l

In my last experience, my waiter went above and beyond. Since I choose to eat gluten-free, I ordered an egg-white omelet and asked if I could substitute the toast for fresh fruit. He said I could substitute the fruit for hash browns, but not for the toast. So I passed on the toast, but did order the hash browns. It took longer than I expected for eggs (it was about 30 minutes) and he came back to my table just before my food came out and said ""I'm so sorry for the delay in your food, but I wanted to talk to the chef before putting in your order to make sure the hash browns were ok for you ... just to make sure we didn't put bread or anything in them, because I know they're not just plain potatoes.""

I was SO impressed that he made that effort!

While I was waiting for my food, I was watching the efficient wait staff bus and reset tables. As the man was resetting the table next to me for the next guest, he was putting out the side\/bread plates and I noticed a piece of paper on one of the plates (like a receipt or washing instructions from a new box of china). I wondered if he would notice and as soon as he finished - he took one last look at the table, saw the paper, looked at it as if to say ""what is that?"" and not only removed the paper but also replaced the plate with a clean plate.

What attention to detail! I have been VERY impressed with Grand Lux in every dining experience. Kudos!",0,0,0

Portion sizes are hearty and the food is tasty! We ordered different omelettes each time. We made our own omelettes with the list of toppings (max of 4), as well ordered the chorizo and cheese omelette, fresh garden omelette, and the crab & asparagus omelette.

The chorizo and cheese was bursting with flavor but a little too oily\/greasy for me - especially for breakfast. Between all the omelettes we've had, it definitely had the boldest flavor. Something I'm willing to skip first thing in the morning. 

I liked both the build-your-own and the fresh garden omelettes - fresh, hearty, and nutritious! Definitely a nice kick-start to the morning! 

Crab & Asparagus omelette - tasty, but a bit of a waste. The tomatoes, asparagus, and cheese were simple and awesomeee together. Unfortunately, they overshadowed any presence of crab. Sure, you could see the little crab meat pieces, but the expected seafood-y sweetness that comes from crab was buried under the other flavors in the omelette.

All the omelettes came with a generous side of toast + jam\/butter!

There is ample seating and I love the high ceilings. It made it seem like it was an even bigger restaurant than it already was.

FOOD
The food was delicious. I ordered the SHRIMP SCAMPI WITH ANGEL HAIR PASTA, which was way more than enough for 2 people.

That's the great thing about this place: the portions are HUGE so you can easily split food amongst you and your friends.

I expected the dish to be very salty, but it was actually cooked perfectly! The shrimp was plump, succulent, and had a little crispiness to it that was unexpected but tasty. The sauce was divine and the diced tomatoes complemented the dish perfectly. The pasta was cooked just right and balanced the dish's flavors.

I had the ahi salad, and it was delicious. A good amount of ahi, and avocado, and a yummy dressing. Also had a pear martini which was decent - not great,  but fine. (The waiter told me their drinks were strong. I didn't agree but also admit my perception is somewhat skewed!) My colleagues had a pulled pork sandwich and fish and chips, and both were happy about their selections. One said the coleslaw was some of the best he'd ever had.

VERY nice service (including giving three people four checks so that we could each expense our food separately, and me leave the martini off the expense report!) and good food.

Here's what you need to know

1)  Great spot any time of day - pretty awesome in the middle of the night
2)  Their food is exceptional - if you're drunk\/hungover\/about to pass out... whatever.  Just don't expect it to taste like the dish you're served once you get to heaven then you'll be disappointed.
3)  Yes, the line will look intimidated - but calm down... you'll be seated in 10-15 mins.
4)  I literally ate here every meal during my stay at the Venetian a couple weeks back.  20% out of convenience and 70% because of the good food.
5)  It's not expensive... especially for Vegas

Good stuff:

Whatever the hell those mashed potatoes wrapped in an egg roll are called

The miso cod - had it for lunch and dinner with the mashed potatoes instead of rice.  It's really good

Their volcano shrimp

The corned beef hash - my bf actually exclaimed ""this is real meat!"" when he got it

So last weekend, we do the walk from the Aria to the Venetian (really long walk) in search of this restaurant. It seems counterintuitive that this great food comes out of this normal looking casino restaurant, but it really was good. 

I've been on a pasta carbonara fix (trying to relive my amazing Rome dining experience), so I ordered it with low expectations since every other place has been terrible. I have to say that this was the best pasta carbonara that I've had outside of Rome. It was a very cheesy cream sauce and with actual thick cut bacon. The whole meal tasted like smoked bacon. The lunch portion was huge and since it was very rich, I couldn't finish it. My husband ordered the short rib burger (short ribs are a topping on the burger) and he liked it a lot. Dad ordered the ribs and mom the ahi salad, which they both loved just as much the first time. 

Unfortunately, there were some cons. My husband's burger came without any dressings\/sauces, which is a little strange. He had to ask for mayo and our server said he'd have to go to the kitchen to get it. My mom asked for soy sauce and wasabi. Our server told us they only had soy sauce, which was a lie because they had a wasabi dressing for the ahi appetizer. I suspect the wasabi dressing was in the kitchen and our server didn't want to go back after retrieving the mayo.

CREAM OF ASPARAGUS SOUP
This soup was quite tasty and definitely creamy! More on the creamy side than the vegetable taste but it's so good! I wish I only ordered this!

SHORT RIB GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH - $13.50
Slow roasted short rib, caramelized and picked onion, arugula and melted cheese, served on country bread. A plate you can share!  This crunchy and unctuous sandwich made also came with horseradish garlic sauce which really complimented it.  It also came with salad which I decided to have the cream of asparagus instead!  It's quite cheesy and greasy and all around good.  Although not the best grilled cheese I ever had, it was the greasy spoon I needed after a long weekend of drinking ;) 

PASTA CARBONARA (lunch pasta & salad special) - $12.50
Smoked bacon, peas, a touch of garlic and karma dan cream sauce! We chose the twisted pasta instead of spegetti.  The pasta portion is HUGE! Definitely share-able.  although I had to ask for extra sauce because it didn't seam enough.  Overall this dish was okay :)

As for the salad, I'm glad it didn't taste like regular typical house salad.  It had dressing and a lot of the veggies that were decent.

My overall experience here was ok.  I feel we came here for convenience; it was in our hotel and we knew it had a variety of choices to eat.

She asked us how many for the second time, we said two, she smiled and made eye contact with another employee who started walking her way. This couple who was behind us was then asked by her how many, they said two and she said ""ok come with me""... What the heck? And sits them on an ""outside"" . The second coworker makes it to us 2 mins after and puts us in between two other couples. Tight and awkward. Like in previous posts, although not busy everything took long.

Bread was terrible. More like toast. Super hard and very crumby. Not hot or even warm. Waffle oj the other hand though was perfect. Crispy, fluffy and full of flavor!! So so good. A must try.

There is no check back with your food. We had 3 waiters in the 45 min time frame we where there. No refills either on water. Bill was quick to come out.",0,0,0

Funny, because we would never think to go to the LA location. But my experience here may have changed my mind. 

Both times we were lucky enough to be able to dine 'al fresco' - meaning a gorgeous view of the casino. But hey it still felt cool!

The first trip was a woozy breakfast after our first night out. We shared a bruschetta style breakfast dish and a couple of other egg dishes. I love that they serve real hash browns instead of home fries - so much more satisfying! The service was awesome, a cute little Asian man (I can say that because I'm Asian and he reminded me of my dad) who was totally attentive and fine with bringing us extra place settings and plates so that we could share. 

The second trip was late at night after a trip to XS. This was an entirely different kind of meal, a ravenously hungry, get me some comfort food now before I fall asleep at the table kind of meal. One of my friends actually may have nodded off while waiting for our food. Again, we shared, this time the zen noodles, a yummy asian noodle soup with a lemongrass broth, and the pasta carbonara, THE BEST pasta carbonara I have ever had. The service again was commendable, considering it was about 2 in the morning and the place was filled with obnoxious patrons. The waiter was super nice and even reassured us when a loud alarm went off in the casino and we got nervous.

We chose Grand Lux Cafe as our start.  We were promptly seated and the section we were in  was not crowded.  Nevertheless, it took 20 minutes for our waiter to appear.  In the meantime, when the bus person came, I mistook them for the waiter and they let me know in minimum words, tone,  and tempo that they were not the waiter. Interestingly enough, when the waiter did appear, he too used the same communication style as the bus person.  We ignored the lack of communication skills and asked for some clarifications of the menu and ordered: Crispy Calamari, Fuji Apple Salad,  and the Honey Cashew-Honey Kale salad.  By the time the food arrived, we had lost 49 minutes of my granddaughter's lunch hour.  The batter on the calamari batter was mushy, not throughly cooked, so we asked the waiter to remove it declining a replacement due to time.  The Honey-Cashew Kale salad had an excellent crispy texture but was extremely bland in taste.  My granddaughter requested shrimp in her Fuji Apple salad and was given 2 measly shrimp, split in two, to appear as if it was 4 for a $5 additional charge.  The manager came by and using the very same communication style as his subordinates, with a steroid boost of monotones, stated his concerns and that he would remove the calamari from our bill as if he was doing something benevolent for us.

I was pleasantly surprised after staying at the Palazzo for a week and found this restaurant in the casino, late one night. My co-worker and I were walking (crawling) back to our rooms and I really wanted pizza, she some dessert. 

Anything you want in Vegas! We walked in and gave it a shot. Pizza was devoured and the dessert thoroughly lapped off the plate. We eat pretty clean during our trips but this was magical. We even discovered that the place is HUGE inside when we returned to have some burgers for lunch later in the week. Very much like the Cheesecake factory but I like this one better.

If you've never been to the Grand Lux it is essentially an upgraded Cheesecake Factory with a slightly different menu. Same 471 page food and drink menu which takes a good 30 minutes to read through. My favorite thing to order is the pot roast with mashed potatoes as I like to pretend that June Cleaver is my mother and she's whipped me up a beautiful meal. 

My last memory of the Grand Lux Cafe is actually the inability to remember eating there. I woke up in my hotel room after a crazy night of clubbing for my friend's bachelorette party and groaned out loud: 

Me: ""I'm soooo hungry! When are we going eat?""
My girlfriend: ""How can you be so hungry? You ate so much at Grand Lux!"" 
Me: ""We didn't eat at Grand Lux Cafe last night."" 
My girlfriend: ""Uh yes we did, you had two strawberry waffles and a pot roast."" 
Me: ""What?! And I don't remember a thing!"" (Slaps hand to forehead)
Me: ""Want to go there again for breakfast?""

Ribeye: 4\/5 Again though price for value, it was a very good steak for the amount you pay. Cooked pretty well to what I asked.

Chicken Parmesan: 5\/5 The BEST chicken Parmesan I've had hands down anywhere. When recommending items I always recommend this item to my friends and family and never were their expectations let down. The breading seasoning is just the right amount, with just the right amount of crispness in each bite.

Servings are also quite generous.

Service is not too bad. Positive servers. OK wait time for food and as long as the back area is open, the wait time for seating is not too bad either.",0,0,0

I constantly stay at the Venetian\/Palazzo when I'm visiting Vegas so this has become one of my go-to places. It's convenient (right by the elevators to the suites), it's tasty, and it's open 24 hours. It really can't get any better than that!

I probably go to Vegas around once or twice a year so I rarely get to eat at Grand Lux (it's LA location unfortunately closed). Therefore, I always order the same thing when I go, which is the Pasta Telephono. I absolutely love it. It's got a nice tomato sauce, with melted cheese and bread crumbs on top. You can get the lunch portion which comes with a side salad ($12.95), but they only serve this until 5pm. The dinner portion costs $16.95. Kinda pricey for a pasta that doesn't even come with any meat. Adding chicken will cost you an additional $2, and they actually charge you per shrimp if you want to add that! I've never heard of a restaurant doing that before!

Anyways, I can't really comment much on their other dishes. I've tried a few others before and didn't have any complaints. They have a huge menu, including sandwiches\/burgers, pizzas, and fried chicken, so you're bound to find something you like. It's very similar to Cheesecake Factory.",1,0,1

We'd been pretty disappointed with most of the restaurants in the Venetian at this point in our trip, but it was early and we wanted to grab some breakfast.

Our server (Aimee) pointed out that the breakfast buffet would be less than the meals we were considering since I was ordering orange juice, and the juice was included in the buffet.   I'm glad she recommended it, because it was a pretty decent breakfast buffet.  I think it was only about $10-12 and we were both very satisfied with the breakfast.  Lots of fruit, waffles, sausage, bacon -- pretty standard breakfast buffet fare, along with an omelet station.  Fresh squeezed orange juice (about $5 a glass) was included with free refills.  That alone was worth it.

My family and I came here for breakfast two days in a row, and both days we had encountered a few bloopidy-bloopers.

The first day, the service was alright -- a little slow, but not bad. Everything was going well until my boyfriend found something nice and crispy in his nachos... Green onion? Nope. Charred meat? I guess not. Oh, what was this -- a TOOTHPICK?! Holy moly, that could have been lodged into his throat if he didn't catch that sooner. We complained, got the dish taken off the bill. All was well.

Day two. Now, this was crazy. We got some slightly creepy server named Valerie(?), who took forever to get us water. We must have waited 15 minutes maybe, and then we asked again for water, and she tried to blame it on the bus boy. Um, girl, he's a bus boy, not your water wench, so please, after several years of experience in the restaurant industry, if I was that waitress, I would have gotten my table water right away. That's pretty much a given in any restaurant. Even horrible-service Chinese restaurants give you water faster. And then my blueberry pancakes were blueberry-less... so I had to ask for blueberries, which came on the side. BAH. 

The food here is just okay... I was just reading that review before mine that says that this is Cheesecake Factory's sister restaurant... and I believe it. The Cheesecake Factory is not too great, and neither is this place. It's just well-priced with decently large portions, but it tries to cater to a variety of palates, and I think it tried a little too hard.

It's under the ""LARGE SALADS"" section and it is huge.  I do not recommend that you eat this by yourself, piggy.

The remainder of the evening went well. Everyone enjoyed their food. Sorry, too many people to name individual meals.

They serve your usual rote of bland (or over-salted) American standards: pastas, giant burgers, monstrous breakfasts. On one meal, my husband's Grand Lux Burger was relatively dry, I enjoyed the Shortrib Grilled Cheese, which made for good hangover food, but really nothing to write home about. During another meal I had the corned beef hash, which was nice -- not your typical Denny's canned fare, but the over-easy eggs that I'd ordered were slightly overcooked.

It's relatively inexpensive sit-down fare (by Vegas standards, anyway) - not bad if you want to grab a fairly quick bite in between gambling runs and don't feel like leaving the hotel or patronizing the food court.",1,0,0

We had already eaten at the one in the Palazzo that morning so we knew the food wouldn't disappoint. We were seated quickly. Our server was very friendly.  Since we weren't starving, we decided to split a pizza. We ordered the Sausage, Pepperoni & Mushroom pizza off of the late night menu. The food did take a little while to get to the table.

Most of the good restaurants on the Strip were pretty much closed for the night and I didn't really want to settle with McDonald's, Denny's, or White Castle.  And because I didn't rent a car for this trip, I couldn't venture out to my usual late night off-Strip spots like Jinya Ramen or Bachi Burger.  So I decided to hit up my old reliable late night eating spot, Grand Lux Cafe.

When I got there, I wasn't in the mood for a burger since I had one just a few hours earlier before my flight from SFO.  So I went with ordering a couple of appetizers from their late night menu, the Pastrami Reuben Egg Rolls and the Buffalo Chicken Rolls.  I kind of almost regretted ordering two apps though, because the portion sizes for each one were ridiculously huge and could basically be considered a meal on their own right.  

Pastrami Reuben Egg Rolls -- http:\/\/bit.ly\/1TBZAi2
Hot Pastrami, Melted Cheese, Sauerkraut and Mustard in a Crisp Wrapper. Served with Thousand Island Dressing and Pickles
These were seriously good!  Basically you're taking everything that's awesome from a reuben and rolling them up into crispy egg rolls.

Buffalo Chicken Rolls -- http:\/\/bit.ly\/25jdk39
Chicken Breast, Cheese and Our Very Spicy Delicious Buffalo Sauce all Rolled in a Spiced Wrapper and Fried until Crisp. Served with Celery Sticks and Blue Cheese Dressing
These reminded me of those buffalo chicken rolls that you get at 7-Eleven, but kicked up several notches.  I liked with how much chicken was in each roll and how the buffalo sauce had a perfect amount of heat to them.

So basically I ordered two sets of uber egg rolls, but it didn't bother me one bit, especially since my waiter said they were two of his favorite apps on the menu.  I was struggling to finish both though because of their portion size, but I pushed through and finished!!  

Honey Vanilla Latte -- http:\/\/bit.ly\/1sRc7Tb
Double Espresso, Honey, Vanilla and Steamed Milk
I ordered this basically to keep my night going into the wee hours of Saturday morning since my plan was to stay up as long as I could to make up for the lost hours from my delayed flight.  
And it definitely did the job.  It was a nice flavor!  

All in all, I left Grand Lux Cafe stuffed, very satisfied, and ready to continue my late night gallivanting on the Strip.  I'm glad that they still deliver with quality late night eats!",14,10,12

Two of us went for dinner.  The first sign of trouble was so many different staff came by the table we were never quite sure who our waiter was.  Someone took the drink order; a different person took the food order.  Every single item was brought to the table by a different person.  You might think this would make it a very fast and efficient, but no.  I ordered the cream of chicken soup and a small chopped salad.  My partner ordered the smoked salmon platter.  We each had a drink.  When the food arrived the smoked salmon platter did not have a bagel as it should have.  I tried to flag down our waiter or any waiter and it was next to impossible.  Finally our(?) waiter arrived and we explained the problem.  Fifteen minutes later still no bagel and no sign of our waiter.  I got the attention of another waiter and explained the problem.  Ten minutes pass and no bagel and no waiter.  By now I'm getting agitated.  I manager comes over and I explain the problem of the missing bagel and missing waiter.  I also stated that I didn't think we should have to pay for the platter since we have now been there for over an hour.  He went to the kitchen to check.  The waiter then appeared and said the kitchen had no bagels but the manager was taking care of things. (No offer to reorder just more waiting).  Finally two hard as a rock bagels arrive.  As a ""courtesy"" the manager removed the charge for the $5.00 soup.(How generous)  We never saw him again.  The whole affair, from arriving at the table to check arrival takes nearly two hours! You bet I paid in cash so as not to have to wait for my credit card to come back.  I think the waiter tried his best.  The problem here seems to be TOTAL lack of management and total chaos in the kitchen.  It was 8:00pm and the place was half empty. The looked to be more than ample wait staff.

      I'd heard of Grand Lux being a Cheesecake Factory owned chain, and saw one last weekend in L.A off of Wilshire. I  yelped 24 hour restaurants in Vegas and the second one that shows up was this one. We arrived at 11:45 p.m this past Thursday and everyone from the hostess that answered our questions on the phone to the bus boy that gave us water was nice, professional, and attentive!! It's hard to find good food and excellent service during normal hours of the day let alone at midnight! Only in Vegas, I guess. Our waitress was so nice and gave us some suggestions on what clubs are hot at the moment. We loved it so much we went back the next night at around 10 p.m. (would've gone three days in a row, but no time!)and same deal except this time we noticed they offered chicken and waffles on their menu. GOURMET CHICKEN AND WAFFLES! TAKE THAT ROSCOES!! For dessert we got a dozen pecan chocolate chip cookies to go for something around $6.00 and they were made fresh!! You can't beat that!!

Grand Lux is better than Cheesecake Factory! Trust, I went to one at Caesar's and everyone there thought they were too good to work there or threw their dirty laundry with other workers out in the open with us. Not classy. 

    I urge you not to waste your money or time on crap late night food cafes that over charge you for undercooked food and bad service. Grand Lux is better than Cheesecake Factory!",0,0,0

Located in the Venetian Hotel, this is a good spot to try some quick American-influence entrees. I've been here a couple of times with a party of four or greater - of course here on business. It's pretty relaxing considering how crowded it can be. During my visit, the wait staff was very attentive, kept our water filled at all times. And kept on bringing warm bread. 

One thing I found interesting is how they broadcast their recent health and safety inspection - a wall dedicated to letter A's. It's actually quite nice. 


Food was pretty good considering the cost, and I must say, wait times on food is exceptional considering the crowd. During a tradeshow evening, this place was jammed packed - and we got our food in about 15 minutes. Very quick considering the crowd. 

I had the Spaghetti with Clams and Shrimp. Good portions of food - although, I would've preferred less Clams and Shrimp. It seemed a bit much. 

I also tried the Keylime pie - it was much larger than I expected - so, consider that a warning for those who have a desire with dessert.

So I came here with a group of people (7 people) and we all shared our entrees. 

**FOOD:
- We ordered the Grand Italian pizza and according to my brother, it tasted like something that you can get from the frozen aisle at a Ralphs.
- Pasta with Chicken, Sun dried Tomatoes and Mushrooms and Pasta Carbonara was too CHEESY!! After a few hours, the boy and I got a tummy ache. I would not recommend the pasta entrees. It isn't great (my opinion). 
- The Sonoma Salad was probably the only OK entree. I mean you can't go wrong with a salad. 
- The other entree was a bake chicken with mash potatoes, no bueno. My cousin said the chicken was dry.

Their chicken was A+. Chicken is my favorite kind of meat, so I am a bit picky about chicken in dishes, but the chicken here is DELICIOUS! It's not dry at all, and they give you a generous amount.

The boys all ordered burgers, and when their orders came out, I wish I ordered my pasta and a burger. Alas, although it sounded okay in my head, it's probably not socially acceptable to order two entrees, huh? 

They are pretty busy at all hours, so you might have to wait for their servers a bit. We waited a pretty long time before someone came to take our orders. That was no bueno! But what can you do when this restaurant has a full house and a line at 1am?",0,0,0

This review is actually for the Grand Lux Cafe on the side where you order togo.  This was my first time ordering togo at Grand Lux so I was surprised to see a few really cheap items on the menu.  Chicken or tuna salad sandwiches were only about $6!  I ordered a tuna salad sandwich and a Caesar Salad for $4.95 and instantly received my food because they were both premade.

-Tuna Salad Sandwich: just your regular bread with lettuce and tomato, stuffed with tuna salad that was below average.  I've had premade tuna salad sandwiches on campus at UCSD and they were a lot better.
-Caesar Salad: crunchy lettuce is a plus!  But the ranch looked grainy and tasted spicy!  Wat the eff?

     Thank you Grand Lux Cafe or I would have not survived Vegas for a week. My boyfriend and I stayed at the Venetian on our New Year's Vegas trip. I ate here at least 3 times; the first time was at 3 AM on our arrival night. I ordered a club sandwich, which was pretty good on an empty stomach from my 5.5 hrs drive from LA to Vegas. I ordered the sandwich from the bakery because the line was long for the restaurant itself due to club goers. I was disappointed when the guy at the register told me that the wait time will be 40 mins. 40 mins for a sandwich! He was lucky I was hungry! 

     A few days later I grabbed some lunch from the bakery, I had ordered a BBQ chicken pizza and a Caesar salad. The pizza was really good and satisfying. The salad was fresh and the dressing was tasty. My friends had ate some lunch from the cafe about 30 mins earlier, when my boyfriend and I arrived at the suite we were luckily to have some of their calamari. The calamari is to die for!! It comes with an array of dipping sauces and in the mix of calamari - there are some pieces of zucchini. After bites and bites of calamari, it's refreshing to take a bite of the soft zucchini. It helps balances the taste of the calamari. Especially with fried foods, after a handful I'm usually sick of the greasy taste in my mouth. The calamari at Grand Lux is fried perfectly and keeps you wanting more. The portions of the food is pretty good too.

But it ain't great.
And it definitely doesn't live up to my Vegas standards.  And add to that the fact that it is inside my favorite hotel, the Venetian, where I constantly state that the food is AMAZING - - Grand Lux is the only establishment in that hotel that pales in comparison.

It's a coffeeshop atmosphere - extremely large with plenty of seating.  In all of my years of going to the Venetian, I've only stood in line twice or so.... usually, there IS seating available.

There is a LOT on the menu, so much that it is difficult to pick.  The basic things - like a bagel with lox and cream cheese - is fine.  But how hard is a bagel and cream cheese?
Other things - like the club sandwich or the steak sandwich, or the burgers, are all mediocre.  HUGE, yes, but it is a 12 dollar burger so I expect either big in taste of huge, and Grand Lux gives you huge.

I keep on eating here on every visit in spite of the lack of taste, just because it's so convenient  since I stay at this hotel, and the mood is inviting and nice but I am consistently unimpressed with the food.  It's Vegas.  Impress me.... and I give them all these chances, and still - -  they don't.

Coffee is blaaah - as is the case with the entire hotel, and service is decent.  Nothin' to write home about.  For quick and easy eating - - Grand Lux Cafe is okay.  But your socks won't be knocked off, you won't come out moaning and groaning, you won't wonder when the next time you get to eat here will be, and it's definitely not one of those, ""I CANNOT WAIT TO GET HOME TO YELP ABOUT THIS PLACE"" type of restaurant.

It came with sauteed chicken breast with asparagus and mozzarella, topped with a mushroom-Madeira sauce. It was also served with a side of mashed potatoes. The chicken breast was surprisingly tender and the mashed potatoes were nice and creamy. It was pretty decent granted that it's a chain restaurant. I don't recommend that you get their pho though, my friend ordered it and it looked pretty gross. The bean sprouts and basil that was supposed to complement the pho were all wilted and browned.

-I think the portions were big.
-I think I got a burger, I think I liked it.
-My husband tells me he got the short rib grilled cheese...and he also thinks he liked his.
-The server was very nice...and very patient with a very drunk group of 8 people

This place is like cheesecake factory - really long and extensive menu and food portions were huge.

Short Rib Grilled Cheese Sandwich ($10.50 USD)
Slow roasted short rib, caramelized onions, and arugula sandwiched in melted cheese on grilled country bread. Served with a Mixed Green Salad. The sandwich was really good. It was quite greasy though given it was a grilled cheese sandwich, but the slow roasted short rib meat was really tender and the caramelized onions really complemented the meat bringing out a sweetness to the sandwich.

Salisbury Steak ($15.95 USD)
Chopped Sirloin Combined with Onions, Mushrooms and Garlic. Served with Mashed Potatoes, Brown Gravy and Fresh Vegetables. The texture of this steak tasted more like a burger, or even softer - you actually don't need a knife to cut the meat, a fork is good enough. Figures since the steak is made from blend ground beef. It was flavorful and tasty.

The menu is very extensive. For a while, I didn't know what to order because there were so many dishes to choose from. I finally settled on a burger that I can't recall the name of. It was on parmesan cheese toasted bread and it was made to perfection.

My friend and I also had a few drinks which were great, too!!

Their food is delicious and enjoyable every time!
Their fettuccini alfredo is pretty bomb & so are their buffalo chicken rolls and cream of chicken soup!

Never disappoints! Also, don't be fooled by the long lines, especially if you are a small party, just go and sit at the bar! There is almost always bar spots available to eat, despite people wanting to sit at regular tables, and I honestly feel like the bartenders are more attentive anyways!

Our waitress Dragona was absolutely terrible. My fiancé was trying to grab her attention politely, she whizzed past him. It was at least another 5 minutes before she came around our way. We asked her if we could have some bread while we waited. It seemed like it took her a moment to process what we were asking her. Then it took another 10 minutes for it to come out. Another 10 minutes later, we were trying to find her since we wanted some refills. No joke, she disappeared for AT LEAST 15 min. Wtf, who does that? We had to ask a busboy to get us refills, which he graciously grabbed for us. Finally her slow bum came running out, and the busboy was trying to tell her that he had to get our stuff and for her to check on us. She runs over and says ""oh sorry for the wait! Your food should be out any minute!"" 
1. We werent concerned\/bitching about our food
2. We could clearly see the food coming out right behind her. 

After we get our food she had the nerve to ""check on us"" by walking by our table, looking over and saying ""oh you're good. Very good"" Woman, why don't you stop and ask us. Final straw  was when she brought our bill 10 min after we got our food without asking us about dessert. Not that we were going to get dessert, but still. Part of your Job is to ask. 

Icing on the cake: We walked out with the intention to talk to a manager. We saw what looked like 2 of them talking to each other, not caring about us walking out. AND the hostess wasnt paying any attention and didn't bother to de-greet us.

The last five we almost always stay at the Venetian and the Grand Lux Cafe has become our favorite place to eat.

Mind you, we in no way ignore all the great steak house near the strip or in downtown, but for some reason we love this place. On one 3-day trip, we ate their six times. One day, we ate every meal there!

What amkes this place so great? Its variety and the quality of the food. But there's a clincher for us. We always choose to dine in the patio area that overlooks the pathway between the casino and the elevators to the rooms and the stairways from the ballrooms because all the pretty gals in their evening dresses walk by past us. Good food, good friends and lovely ladies. What else could you ask for?!

Regarding the food, GLC makes great burgers, awesome pasta and delicious NY cheesecake. One of my friends loves the jambalaya and another likes the orange chicken. Breakfasts are good as well, and their salads are tasty and bountiful. The iced teas are enormous. They taste unlike any other iced tea I've had and at first I didn't like them, but they've grown on me.

The staff is always friendly and obviously have eaten all the dishes because they never lack for enthusiastic recommendations when we ask.

The portions are quite large, maybe not Claim Jumpers huge, but still big enough to illicit groans from some in our group that they need to go up to the room and lie down. It's also a good thing the restrooms are directly across from the the restaurant. If you need to make room for desert you can just hop the fence and be back right as it's being served.

For the first time, I went with the fish of the day which was Sea Bass. For my 2 sides, I went with broccoli x2. Got capers and onions to go on top as well. My buddy got mushrooms to go with his salmon and I borrowed some of them. All together it was delicious! At $23.95 it was one of the most expensive things on the menu so the place is reasonably priced in general. 

The fish was moist (definitely a little undercooked but I didn't mind because at least they didn't dry it out) the broccoli was hard and understeamed but also didn't bother me.

Let me say straight off, I really wish there was a Grand Lux somewhere other than the Venetian or the Palazzo, the casinos themselves are very nice, spotlessly clean, but the management insists on adding over powering fragrances to the AC supply, I know I am not the only one to find this annoying, but in my case at the minimum I am getting a bad headache from it.

Anyways, the powers that be (wife) decided she wanted to pit the grilled cheese and short rib sandwich we had just tried at Fat Choy against the offering at Grand Lux.
For me it is a no brainer, the Asian Nachos all the way.

Order in quickly, food out quickly, the Asian Nachos, superb as ever (the only reason I brave the smell of this casino is for this dish, yes they are that good), the grilled cheese.

Well totally tasteless, whoever figured it would be a good idea to use swiss cheese, please make them eat 20 of these things and then tell me it's good.

The short rib could have been the saviour, but it seemed to me that it had be have been flavored in 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and a few trace bits thrown in for taste, well ok it's air..The meat had no taste either.

Basically, Grand Lux provides more on the menu than Cheesecake Factory-- you have a wider variety of good stuff to choose from, and of course, cheesecake.

We decided to come here at 1AM due to a lack of other veggie options (it seems like everything vegan is shut down at midnight for some reason). 

The restaurant is nestled in the Venetian hotel, with bistro style seating right next to the casino. Inside, however, it's a bit more intimate with the dim lighting. We could still hear the occasional victory cheers from patrons who hit the jackpot in the casino. Definitely not a quiet place, but a nice reprieve from the hustle and bustle of the casino. 

To start, we spent a good amount of time studying the drink menu. They've got some stellar cocktails, all on the weaker side and kind of expensive, but that's the Strip for ya.

Piña colada: not bad.
Mojito: the bomb.

They've also got several wine and beer options for those looking to avoid cocktails. 

When ordering food, we noticed they have separate menus available depending on what time of day it is. Their overnight menu has a lot of options: my friends got sliders, a breakfast plate piled high with bacon, and a couple cheeseburgers. They also have many steak, pasta, pizza, and salad options. But again, I woefully found a lack of vegan options on this menu.

This is where Debbie came in to save the day. She finagled with the chefs to see if they'd cook up a special dish for me. And they did just that. I was brought a beautiful plate of sautéed mushrooms, broccoli, asparagus, and brown rice. Large servings, well displayed, and made to order. It hit the spot and kept the night from going down a disappointing path.

We never felt rushed. And I was pleased to see one of the chefs, decked out in his nice white chef jacket, personally come out to let us know the progress of our meals.

Debbie checked on us routinely but didn't hover, and she really was a sweetheart.

Walking towards the restaurant there was a line going out the restaurant. However, a sign said it would only take 5-7 mins to get seated which is 100 percent accurate. The issue was that it too about 15 mins before we even got ask for our drinks and it took about 20 mins to get our food. 

The food itself was okay. We got the Baja omelette, joe's scrambled, and the hash. The good was pretty good (it should be for the price). I asked for a sausage to be added to my omelette, but the forgot that no big deal. Also, the omelette was more like a ton of onions and peppers under some eggs; it wasn't really omelette, but that's not that big of a deal. The hash and joes scramble was great. 

Going back to the service...its just slow. Ask for some coffee wait 10 mins. Ask for creamer wait 10 mins. The waiters are just overloaded with tables to serve. It's a huge location and the slow down in breakfast service reflects it.

I don't know about you guys, but I need something crunchy and guilt-ridden when I got the drunk munchies.  The crispy flautas from the appetizer menu is a blessing from above.  Just check out my picture (http:\/\/media4.px.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/uoo08O3ZAgdWMET_-M-cHg\/l).  With the avocado sauce it comes with, this lil snack can be enjoyed intoxicated or not.  SO good.  If it doesn't tickle your fancy..there's still so much to choose from the late hour menu.  It's not as extensive as the daytime menu but you still got your breakfast plates, sandwiches, salad, pasta, etc.

During normal hours, I absolutely MUST have my spicy flat bread chicken sandwich.  Grilled chicken, pepperjack, and all the usual fixings on a pita-like bread split into 4 quarters.  Its corn salsa is the perfect topping.  They lay on a little bit of the chipotle mayo sauce, but I always ask for more for the side of fries it comes with.  You guys really gotta order this at least once.  It's a pretty large amount of food -- I always gotta half it with someone.

Service is always great & I've never had to wait over 5 minutes for a table, but I may have been lucky each and every time.  Wish I had the same kind of luck at the adjacent slots and black jack tables. Hmph..",0,0,0

Given that we were hungry, we ordered an appetizer right away (fried calamari). Afterwards, it took our server (main server) quite some time to get back to us and get our main orders. We order the sunday pasta and the sausage pizza, thinking that whatever was left over we could just eat on the way as well. Let's start with the app. As soon as my calamari came, I noticed there were no lemons. I asked for the server who dropped off the food (server #1) if I could have some lemons. She said yes and went to get them. We never saw her again. Then, we asked a different server for water since our own server was nowhere to be found and thinking that server#1 would be coming back with lemon. We never saw server #2 (and #1). Given the lack of servers available, we then had to ask the host to please locate our server and explained to her that we had asked for water and lemons. The host explained that their calamari does not normally come with lemons but they would bring us lemons. Finally I got my lemons. The pasta and pizza also took some time to come, and I must say... they felt pretty greasy (even to two hungry people). Then we finally saw our main server, but by that point we explained that we were in a rush so we just asked for a to-go box for the rest and the check at the same time.

The first visit we went for brunch (Sunday am, seated right away). Two of the kids got Belgian waffles with strawberries and whip, the other, the Italian Market Sandwich. The waffles were good, but the sandwich was amazing. My son generously offered each of us a small bite and agreed it was the best sandwich ever!

We were very impressed with the quality of the food, but also the inventiveness of the menu- not your standard chain restaurant fare. Everyone was very happy all around. 

After much debate about where to go for dinner  (we were there to go to Dos Caminos or Bouchon), we all decided to go here again. We ordered: a BLT (yummy bacon and bread), the Max Burger (has short ribs on it), Sunday Night Pasta (daughter said it was the best past she has ever had), Chop Salad (the only average meal we ordered), and a Top Sirloin steak w\/fries ( I had my heart set  on steak frites, but every restaurant in Vegas starts steak at $40 + $9 fries- ridiculous!) The steak was tender, flavorful, and well cooked. At $28 for the 8oz steak and $4.95 for the fries I was very pleased). 

Again, a great experience all around. Bravo to Grand Lux for bringing quality dining at a reasonable price.

Salmon & eggs: The salmon was cooked perfectly. It was very tender and didn't have an overwhelming taste of seafood. The eggs were also good (very fluffy).
Chicken & waffles: For me, the better half of the dish was the waffle. The chicken was very lean and seasoned well.
Corned beef & eggs: I have never seen corned beef prepared the way Grand Lux does it. Usually, the corned beef I order is a little mashed up and thin. Theirs is on the thicker side and in big chunks. I'm definitely not saying it's a bad thing, because their corned beef is at the top of my list. Not greasy either.
Red velvet pancakes: YUM. Just thinking about their red velvet pancakes makes me wanna go back. THE best red velvet pancakes you will ever find.

The chicken parm was okay, but the spaghetti was bland. Shrimp scampi is not scampi at all. The shrimp is breaded (?!) and served in a cream sauce, not butter. The parmesan crusted pork chop was the tastiest of the dishes, but side vegetables were limp and lukewarm. I'd also mention the gin and tonic was weak, but watered down cocktails are a Vegas tradition. The restaurant is more than usually noisy. This can be helped slightly by requesting not to sit near the open kitchen. Our wait staff (more than one server per table) were friendly and attentive. Since this is open 24 hours, I'm sure there is a convenience associated with the higher ratings - when you're a bit tipsy and everything else is closed, you don't care much about quality at 2am.

The meal was good. The fries were on point!!! I would liked for the burger to have been bigger considering the cost of the burger but I guess you can only wish, EVEN in VEGAS!!!

My next experience there was roughly the same. Had a different server and was seated a bit closer to the entrance which was a nice change instead of in the back corner.

1.  The food took over an hour to get out, the restaurant was not busy nor did we order complex dishes. (6 people total in group)

2. Refills on water and drinks took a while

My favorite has always been their build your own omelettes where you pick either egg whites or whole eggs and choose 4 ingredients such as ham, sausage, bacon, bell peppers, mushrooms, etc.  The list is quite extensive and I just can't remember it all right now.

They start you off with a huge basket of hot sourdough... I made the mistake of eating the bread and got myself all full before my food got here.  As usual, I went with the omelette, and I asked for my hash browns to be super fried and crispy.  They did not mess around... the hash browns came out in 1 piece because it was fried super crispy.

PROS:
open late! pretty wide selection

CONS:
took a while to get our food (granted it was a table of 8), but could've been cause i was starving...

WHAT I ATE:

- Asian Nachos: wonton chips with chicken, fried rice, drizzled with peanut sauce...and something else too.  but this was pretty delich. there was a little too much peanut sauce, but the portion was a pretty good size (shared it with a friend), and it was different

- Brocolii & Cheddar Soup: i had to get this, cause i hardly find this at home (hawaii), and it hit the spot for me that night. not too cheezy.  i like mines with chuncks of brocolii (which it lacked), but it was still really good

- Pizzas (i didn't eat this but my friends did): good size...you'll be full or definetly good to share.

Food was delicious: Korean beef with pancakes and turkey and brie sandwich with fries were each filling yet fresh, so we weren't feeling heavy at the end of our meal. Note: while the Korean beef with pancakes were indeed delicious, I would hardly call it a Korean dish; there were the ""general Asian flavors"" such as ginger, soy sauce, and peanuts, but the Korean beef did not taste of sesame oil nor pear, and the pancakes seemed more flour-based than the traditional Korean pancake.
The service was lackluster in my opinion, but I'll let it slide, since I find service tends to go downhill late at night anyway due to the little staff available. Hostess was nice, and quickly showed us to a table.

You could walk down the strip to one of those $5 steak-and-eggs places, or the $1 hot dogs, or you could stay in the hotel and go to the only restaurant that's still open.

So you make the obvious mistake.  It's not really a restaurant, it's actually a slightly-modified version of the Cheesecake Factory.  Any place that has the word ""factory"" in the name isn't a restaurant.  They're serving you something that might once have had something in common with food but was sent to a factory, fried and then frozen, and then shipped out all over the US to be heated up in microwaves.  They're serving you food that is actually worse than Hot Pockets.

My waiter was totally stoned.  I don't just mean a little stoned, I mean falling over himself and barely able to walk upright.  Everyone seated in his section kept on looking at each other and rolling their eyes at him.  He thought he was suave and pulling it off, and was so stoned that he never noticed the giggling from everyone who had to deal with him.  Even the busboy was making fun of him.

The food is just what you'd expect from a Cheesecake Factory: fried food in massive portions and completely lacking in flavor.  It's totally quantity over quality.  It has exactly two redeeming qualities: it's available at 2am, and it doesn't require you to leave the hotel.  But next time, do yourself a favor and walk down to get the $5 steak-and-eggs.

Best idea ever!  This place is always crackin'!  Why? Because if you don't know what to eat, then this is your best choice.  They have an extensive menu, just like the one you would find at a Cheesecake Factory, but even bigger!  I love how you have options in every category of cuisine, and know that you will find something to your taste with the confidence that it will taste good.   And if it doesn't, you can always count on their endless list of small plates and appetizers, and their super yummy warm bread available in both white and wheat!

When I come here I usually order a salad because their huge and it gives me the opportunity to eat about 3 baskets of bread.  I would have to admit that I actually come here for the bread.  But their lettuce wraps, egg rolls, and their Ahi Tuna Salad are some of my other regular orders because their good too.  But if you need to load up on some good carbs, and you love butter, come hither to Grand Lux to rid of your hangover after the nightlife on this strip because this joint will be definitely open and ready to serve!

But, don't be sad that it's a chain...because it's pretty dang good and quite a value for a Vegas casino!

---FOOD---
This place has a HUGE variety of options on the menu. Here's what we got: 

1) Ahi Tuna Burger, $15ish
- It was HUGE!!! The tuna was seared perfectly well and coated in a spicy grounded pepper mix that paired really well with the aioli they served. My favorite touch to this burger was the thick whole-grilled red onion slice. 

The burger also comes with fries, but you can opt. for a different side: I opted for the steamed brocolli that is NOT slathered in butter (thank goodness) -- they steam whole heads of brocolli for you. How unique. Ha. 

2) Polynesian Salad, $14ish
- VERY huge and fresh tasting. Sweet, tangy sauce over greens with chicken slices and lots of other excitement I can't recall..
- Loved how they top the salad off with whole pieces of fried wonton instead of mixing in bits and pieces into the salad. It's great because it gives u the option of NOT eating the friedness (cuz...u know...it would be healthier that way) and makes the presentation look cooler simultaneously!

3) Sunday Night Pasta, $17ish
- VERY VERY huge! Meaty! Very savory! My friend could only eat 1\/3! =P

4) CREME BRULEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, $7.50ish -- GET THIS!!!
- For this price, you get TWO huge servings of a vanilla and chocolate delicacy with a waloop of whipped cream that easily satisfied 3 people!!! SO GOOD!!!!

---SERVICE---
Friendly, attentive, efficient. We didn't have to wait at all for a seat (Friday night, too!). 

---AMBIANCE---
The place is huge! And the decor is pretty much...Cheesecake factory. I love how it's so casual, yet still elicits an elegant feeling.

For a restaurant in the middle of one of Vegas' most popular casinos, it's definitely a winner!",1,0,0

Frozen cream cheese next to the strawberries (thinking it's whipped cream).....was so stuck to the serving spoon, that people were using their fingers to get it off on to their plates.  Bacon did not have tongs, and people were using their fingers instead. Tasteless food and chef burning cooked to order eggs was a turn off.

My husband was so dissatisfied with the buffet, that he ordered eggs Benedict off the menu. That was actually better. Hash browns tasted like they came out of a box, but the eggs were fresh and hot and the hollandaise sauce was very good.

When we spoke to the manager, he was hearing me, but not really listening. Did not offer any remedy. All he could tell me was that he would look into quality control. Our server was the one who suggested we order breakfast from the menu.

We had to flag the server down for drink and water refills.  We watched entire tables of people sit down, order, eat, and leave in time while we were waiting for our food.

Our server repeatedly assured us that the food would be served soon, and a manager named Lisa even came by (after about an hour) to tell us that our orders would be up soon.  When the food finally did come, it was cold, had clearly been sitting, and was damn near inedible.

I had Zen Noodles - described as pho on the menu, but in reality it was canned chicken broth (cold by the time it was served) poured over a clump of rice noodles with sliced chicken.  I was so disappointed - no seasoning, no flavor...just a lot of bland, cold, blech.

No one else in my group even came close to finishing or even enjoying their meal.  The ""extensive menu"" is full of previously frozen\/processed\/reconstituted crap.  The food was below Denny's in terms of quality or tastiness.  

I think the icing on the cake was when we let our server know that we'd like the check.  20 minutes later, she delivers the check.  One in our group was leaving from the restaurant to the airport for her 3:30pm flight, so she asked if she could close out first.  The server said yes, grabbed the check, and we watched her go EVERYWHERE EXCEPT THE POS TO CLOSE OUT THE CHECK...checking on other customers, talking to another server...it was almost like she was wandering around looking for something else to do just so that my friend would miss her plane.

Came here on a Saturday night with a group of 11 girls for a Bachelorette party!  I called 3 days before to make a reservation and was glad they were able to accommodate our big party on such short notice. They have a 15 minute wait policy where you will lose your reservations if you're more than 15 minutes late but are pretty accommodating as long as you call to keep them updated on your ETA.

The restaurant is very cute!  It has a cheesecake factory feel to it (I believe they're sister companies) but a bit more glamorous. The lights are dimmed and the decorations are fancy. It's a fun place to eat for a Bachelorette party or even on a romantic date! It's a very large restaurant so it isn't loud in there even with a restaurant full of people. 

The food is also amazing!  The pasta portions are HUGE so it's best to share with another person since there is no way you'll be able to finish it (and yes that is a challenge lol). 

The negatives that keep me from giving it 5 stars: our group waited about 45 minutes just for our food which is way too long for sandwiches and pastas. Our waiter sucked because he hardly came to check on us. Our drinks were always empty and we waited so long after we finished to even get our receipt. Hopefully we just got a bad server and you end up having better luck! Otherwise, this place was amazing!",0,0,0

I ordered Sheila's Dream Salad, which was ginormous.  It had lettuce, shredded carrots, tortilla strip crisps, peanuts, chicken breast, grapefruit, and other things I forgot.

As ""nice"" as everyone is, there are a few important key qualities that were missing from this experience. We were a party of 11 and understandably at a restaurant it may be difficult to get everyone's food out hot and at the same time. 

I'm going to start with there was 45 minute wait, great no problem, it's delicious food. We sat down and drink orders were taken, and not delivered for a while. I know it may be tough to understand if you don't have kids yourself, but when someone has a two year old, please bring the child's drink out... ASAP. No matter how busy your kitchen is, it doesn't take more than a few minutes to bring out Apple juice, not 10. Then after 15 minutes we sent someone to ask for the bread basket to hold us over, until the rest of our drinks arrived and food order was taken.

I ordered the Braised Pot Roast, delicious. It came out with the broccoli cold, I literally handed a piece to the server when they came back... He didn't seem like he knew exactly how to respond to that because it was so obvious. They took my (and my cousins plate who ordered the same)  back, promised new sides and hot plate. This time veggies and potatoes hot, but the inside of the pot roast was cold. Might want to check in the re-heating protocol so you know the outcome.  Needless to say we were starving and ate our dishes anyways. 

I was not a fan of how this was handled and wasn't even offered a manager or a discount to appease this annoying situation. I feel like we were treated as is our business didn't matter because they are such a busy establishment. I won't be suggesting this restaurant any longer, whether I'm in Houston, Vegas, or Scottsdale...",1,2,1

I had a date to meet my guy at the Grand Lux. I didn't think I'd need to specify which one, although I did (which he denies). Haha. As you can imagine, the obvious error occurred. I was sitting outside the Grand Lux at Venetian (with no cell service, go figure) and I couldn't locate him. After 30 minutes I was finally able to locate a spot on the casino floor where I could get service. I called my man and tried to describe where I was in relation to him as he said he had been sitting inside the restaurant all this time. This being his first time inside either the Venetian or the Palazzo, was easier said than done. I finally convinced him to head to the other Grand Lux, which is where I thought I was. 10 minutes later, still no sign of him. Seriously? I was getting agitated. I finally got service again and was able to contact him. He described where he was and I was able to ascertain that he was actually at the Grand Lux opposite from me. Ooops, we were both at the same location from the beginning. I'll own it, that was my mistake. How he walked passed me without me noticing him on his way to the other Grand Lux, I'll never understand. As there are two locations at adjoining casinos, I have to hope that I'm not the only one this has happened to, or are we just that dumb? 

Finally, we're seated and ready to eat. I've been here a number of times before. Usually for some late night grub. The food isn't spectacular. I had a very regular omelette with no bells or whistles and my guy had a very regular sandwich. The food is standard cafe fair. I like the food ok, it's just nothing amazing.

I know it is pretty much just a Cheesecake Factory with a different name, and you can get pretty much get the same food and cheesecakes without flying\/driving all the way out to LV, but everytime we ate at this Grand Lux Cafe, the experience has always been a positive one.

The food overall is pretty good, decent sized portions and fairly priced for a restaurant located inside one of the busy Strip casino. The menu selection is huge, and can be difficult to decide what to order if you are not familiar the menu, but the staff is quick to offer suggestions.

On my most recent stop here after catching Jersey Boys, we didn't have to wait long to get seated.  The food I ordered that time was just okay (but I have enjoyed what I ordered previously, which was mostly pastas, instead of the special being promoted).  Service was good, frequent refills on my iced tea, and when we were ready to settle our bill we didn't have to wait too long for that.

The only thing I didn't like was the appetizer platter and most of their Asian-inspired appetizers, which I thought were mediocre at best. But all of their pasta entrees that I have tried have been good, and I will drop by when I am in the mood.

4 stars.  

And during AVN\/AEE convention in January, we can do a lot of people watching while waiting to be seated, since a lot of the adult entertainment stars come down the escalators in front of this Grand Lux Restaurant.

And the big draw is the fact that they are open 24 hours a day, so a decent grub is available all the time if you are in the Venetian.",2,0,1

When we got there, I saw a line out the door and felt instantly defeated.  To my surprise, the line moved insanely fast and we were seated within 5 minutes of arriving.  The place is MASSIVE and it was packed.  Our server was sweet and competent and took our order promptly.

The food was amazing!  As an appetizer, we ordered a blue cheese salad-- lettuce coated with delicious blue cheese dressing, sprinkled with chunks of blue cheese, thick chunks of bacon, fresh croutons, and tomatoes.  To this day it remains the #1 salad we've ever eaten.  For our main courses, we had meatballs served on polenta and some kind of shrimp dish; both were perfect.

Ok. This Grand Lux Cafe is located on the casino level of the Palazzo. It is open 24 hours, so I didn't really think it was going to be THAT great. After fumbling around the casino with our stomach lining stuck to the spine, we decided we will settle for this place, not knowing what kind of surprise we were in for.

We ordered Caprese Salad, and I ordered Chicken Parmasan. (I forgot what my guy ordered. uh oh =P) The caprese salad was probably one of my favorite caprese salads I've had in a while. Instead of getting a neatly cut tomatos and cheese, we were greeted with a bed of lettuce and chopped tomatos, smothered in cheese and excellent dressing. Oh man, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Then the chicken parmasan. When I was ordering this dish, the server asked if I wanted the dinner size or lunch size. I ordered the lunch size, bit worried if I ordered enough food, but then this humongous chicken came out on top of spaghettini lighly tossed with tomato sauce. Oh man, it was probably one of the best I've had, but since it was so huge, I could only eat half of it. I wonder what the dinner size would look like, but I am sure it could be able to feed 2. 

We came back home to LA after a lovely stay at the Palazzo. When we were passing by Beverly Center, then that is when we realized that they have another Grand Lux Cafe on the 1st floor of Beverly Center. Oh man, we are glad to know that we can get their food right at home. (Assuming they serve the same stuff)",3,2,2

She quickly retorted there aren't any available and we'd have to wait. Uhm, what? You didn't even bother to check! We agree to wait for one, so we follow her back to the front and my boyfriend asks her how long the wait is...but she simply shrugs her shoulders and rudely turns away to chat with the other hostess.

WTF. When we were finally seated, we notice that the party who came after us was seated at a big comfy booth while we were stuck at one of the tables with the most foot traffic. This peeved the BF so much that he felt obligated to speak to the manager, who understood our concern and apologized profusely, even throwing in a free bag of cookies.

While yes, it is owned by the same people, Cheesecake Factory, to me, is a too-large menu where every dish comes to you simplified and blander than necessary where if Cheesecake Factory would just figure out what they wanted to excel in- they'd be great.

Enter Grand Lux Cafe. Exactly what I've wished Cheesecake Factory would do. Grand Lux seems like they figured out everything they did well, and only put those on this menu. Either that- or I, and the people at the table, ordered really well.

But, what really stood out was our service. Quick, no nonsense, and always there for a refill, question, or helpful advice- LINDA C. was THE BEST server I have had in a really long while, and (if you didn't notice) I'm very critical when it comes to service. Not only was I a restaurant trainer, but moreso- I was a BOH trainer, and anybody in the industry knows- there's an unspoken line between Front of the House and Back of the House. So, a server of mine is already battling with some prejudice when I sit down.

I have to tell you- if I could- I'd take Linda C. with me to show any future trainees- THIS is what a server does, how they look, how they act, and the service every customer should expect when they decide to be lazy and not cook their own food.  I hope this review finds its way to somebody at Grand Lux for further accolades for Ms. C.  I couldn't have been happier with my meal.

The short ribs and light sauce just stick to the thin spaghetti perfectly and is comfort food at its finest. It's nice that the Las Vegas locations are still open for business when the Los Angeles ones have all closed down. 

A restaurant concept from the originators of the Cheesecake Factory, Grand Lux Cafe also has a diverse menu that focuses on what I call new American diner. It is a good place for larger groups because the menu options are wide enough to give most members in your party something to choose. 

The food is rich and some salads have more calories than their regular entrees.  Iced tea is one choice: regular, which differs from Cheescake's passion fruit iced tea option. Calamari tastes better than Cheesecake's version but order the large because the mini is really mini. For dessert get a cheesecake of course.",1,0,1

Right from the start the waiter told us that the portions were huge so if we did not eat a lot that we could get a lunch portion or might want to share.  The honesty was refreshing as in Vegas all everyone does is try to up sale. 

The food was great. Me and the g\/f split a pizza and the LUNCH\/half portion Sonoma salad, delish.

As I said about portion size, we couldn't finish that and gave it to one of the many down on their luck people we say on the bridge.

Grand Lux has always been a must stop while im here. So far I havent had anything bad but then again the menu is very extensive. Pages and Pages of food choices. They are a sister company of Cheesecake Factory so that should give you an idea of the type and quality of food.

Since most times im here for the late night, im going to have to recommend breakfast. You can always eat breakfast anytime of the day but something about having it after a night of drinking with friends.

The corn chowder is great. Its full of corn, not milky and theres bacon it in. Yes, alot of bacon. I did have to add a little pepper to spice it up a bit but it could be just me.

The fresh basil with moz cheese pizza is great. The moz is so fresh and the basil with the oil and the thin crust remind me of CPK but better. Oh did I just say that =)

We ordered the calamari, some kind of sandwich and spinach artichoke dip. The calamari tasted soooo gooood, spinach artichoke dip was really good, and I dont remember much about the sandwich but I'm sure it was fine. 

We came here saturday night too, also after a long night out.

It makes me smile when people write that the association with Cheesecake Factory is bad.  Why is that?  With Cheesecake, you are guaranteed a reasonable experience with good food, enormous portions, and competitive prices.  Grand Lux is no different, AND the restaurant has a better menu.  

People love their star chefs and fancy restaurants.  Maybe they live in parts of the United States where access is difficult and cannot compare the LV versions to the originals.  In my experience, they are often poor renditions or ghosts if you will, of their original versions (e.g. Craftsteak MGM vs. NY, Daniel Wynn vs. NY, and Bouchon Venetian vs. Napa).   The quality of food and service doesn't translate to Las Vegas, and I think the majority of people agree with me here.

But you can't say the same thing with Grand Lux.  It is a super-sized version of the Cheescake Factory; same decor but with better service and seating.  Wait-time is low, and the food gets served rather quickly.  Food quality is what you've come to expect - moderate to high.

And they are not getting any cheaper.  I'm all for the same food and a more expensive menu. But when the food quality and consistency drops and then the price goes up.... that is bad business.

Didn't bring the bill or clear the plates until I nicely got his attention. He earned a $2.25 tip on a $30 check. I'd never ever ever tip under 18% ever ever but this guy was shit.

We all ended up choosing a 'medium plates', which was actually still too big for any of us to finish. My housemade pierogies were so delicious! Light, fluffy potato dumplings served on top of braised short ribs & mushrooms.. mmm. I also tried a bit of the kobe (softball-sized) meatballs in the creamy cheesy polenta which were also great. Our appetizer of wings were also moist inside with a nice crunchy exterior. Yum! Considering how much food they give, the prices are definitely reasonable and they are open 24\/7, which is perfect for everyone in Vegas!",4,1,2

If you go in here and noticed the resemblance of the Grand Lux Cafe and CheeseCake Factroy, it is not a coincidence! They are sisters, sisters! Owned by the same people!

I ate here in January 2010 & went back on August 2010.
We went here on Thursday night and Friday morning too!

Everything that I've tried there is so good.


We love the crispy chicken flautas, you will find them under the things to share category, those flautas are HUGE! I'm thinking like 9 inches long. You get four of those per order so with 1 -2 you are done! So don't be stingy and share!

I also got to tried some pasta, I forget what it was called, but it was delicious!

They have great burgers also! I used to be grossed out about medium rare meat, but I was wrong! That's the best, it brings out the flavor and juices of the meat.

We also ordered the half chicken salad sandwich, salad and soup-
-The Salad was delicious
-Asparagus soup was the best, I've ever tried
-The sandwich, good but I wouldn't order it again. 

Highly Recommended :)

I like the location inside the Venetian better than the one in the Palazzo but the food is just as good at both. 

They have great bread,  good omelettes refreshing ass Arnold Palmer's. The patty melt is good all of the sandwiches are great. The grilled cheese with pulled pork is yummy as well as the Santa Barbara chicken sandwich. They have those amazing cafe fries that are crispy but soft at the same time. 

BUT, The most amazing thing they have in their Encyclopedia like menu are the burgers. Holy shit their burgers are bomb. Outrageously good!!!!

Add bacon, cheese, avocado, crispy onions, add mushrooms, add pulled pork, add anything to it and it's going to be delicious!!!!! Man it sucks that I can't get one in Los Angeles anymore. But one of these when you're drunk or even sober is out of this world!!!

We were seated as soon as we walked through the door, and waters, and bread quickly came our way, which were much appreciated since we were famished. 

After a quick peek at the appetizer section of the menu we placed an order for some Buffalo Chicken Rolls, and by the time those suckers arrived we were able to decide what we wanted for our main course. I opted for the Lunch Special Pasta and Salad with the Pasta Telephono. But more on that later. The Buffalo Chicken Rolls (which came with 6 pieces) were crispy on the outside, and warm, gooey, cheesy, and buffalo-y on the inside. Plus they weren't too filling. So we had plenty of room for our entrees. 

Just as we polished off our appetizer, our lunch entrees arrived. And they were HUGE. The side salad was pretty standard. But the pasta was cheesy (notice a theme here?), well-cooked, and tasty. It was basically an adult mac n cheese. And it was so gigantic that I had enough leftover for a late night snack. 

And, best of all, the bill came to under $20 per person. It was so very reasonable, especially in Vegas where everything is overpriced. I suggest checking this place out: it'll give you the most grub for your buck (except for maybe a buffet).",0,0,0

My buddy and I were in town for CES and in need of a no-reservations-needed dinner at around 8pm on a Friday.  I had been to the Beverly Hills Grand Lux numerous times in years past and always enjoyed it, but it never really stood out as a great restaurant to me.  When I called this Grand Lux there was no wait time, so we made our way there from Caesar's and were immediately seated.

We ordered a couple of drinks (I ordered the house Chardonnay, which was by Beringer and was a great deal at $7 and really good), looked over the menu and decided to share a few items.  The three we chose were:

Short rib sliders - Four little sliders on brioche buns, stuffed with super tender and flavorful braised short rib and topped with a creamy horseradish sauce.  Fantastic!

Avocado-Chipotle Cheeseburger - A pretty massive cheeseburger.  Messy and kind of hard to eat, but with delicious ingredients.  A nice kick, too.

Spicy Carnitas Sandwich - An excellent mix of textures and flavors.  Crisp on the outside and super tender on the inside.  A great sauce was provided with this one and it was delicious.

Each of the entrees came with a side salad, so for around $35 we had a great quality meal and were satisfied with the quantity of food, too.  Can't recommend this place enough.",0,0,0

Service
-They told us when we arrived that one person was taking our order and another would be taking care of us after, due to a shift change. The heads-up was good, but when the order came out wrong, the second server wasn't that helpful in fixing it. One of our friends ordered an egg white omelette and it came out made with eggs. He asked the waitress who said they could fix it, but it would take awhile. Shouldn't something they messed up be expedited?

Food
-We all got eggs or an omelette. The omelettes were pretty large and not greasy. My husband and I got ours made with veggies, and it definitely came with a lot of fresh veggies. The home fries they were served with looked like they were frozen and heated.
-Bread came in a basket for the whole table with butter and jam. It was toasted and pretty good. Nothing special, though.
-Not really their fault due to when we arrived for our meal, but wish they served breakfast for longer.

Drinks
-I just had water, but my husband and our friend each got a bloody mary. It was served with two pickled asparagus on top, which they both enjoyed a lot. They said they drink was a healthy amount of spicy!

Ambiance
-This is one of those places right off the casino floor. I get that many people come to Vegas for this, but it's actually not an aspect I enjoy due to all of the cigarette smoke. We were seated on the perimeter of the restaurant, so quite close to the casino. The restaurant is all open to the casino, but perhaps requesting a seat a bit further to the interior of the restaurant would block this smell a bit?

Two friends and I walked into the bar to have a couple of drinks before calling it a night (our first and only drinks of the night). One of us, who does not drink alcohol, ordered a coffee beverage (latte), his wife ordered a mojito and a shot of tequila, I decided to take a shot with her, so I ordered a shot of Belvedere and a pour of Balvenie 12 year as my sipper. The waiter brought out four drinks. The latte, my friend's mojito and two shots, one clear (vodka) which he gave to me and one brownish-gold (tequila) which he gave to my friend. I hate shots so I was waiting for my Balvenie to have something to sip after, but it was taking a while. Fortunately, I had a bottle of water I had brought in with me, so we went ahead with our shots (which were very generously poured, btw). After a few more minutes, I asked the waiter for a status on my Balvenie. He then told me he already brought it. I explained that he had brought my shot of Belvedere, but not my pour of the Balvenie. He didn't seem to believe us, but acknowledged and walked away, presumably to take care of it. A new waiter then came over and asked what happened, and we explained again. He seemed more accepting and intent on correcting the issue and proceeded to get my pour of Balvenie. With that in hand, we decided to order another round of shots. The tequila was way too strong for my friend, so she decided to take my advice and join me in another shot of Belvedere as I found it quite smooth. We drank our shots and the second one definitely tasted much harsher and was a noticeably more conservative pour than the first shot (if I were a more cynical person, I would question whether it was actually Belvedere) and continued talking, laughing and simply catching up with each other. Then the bill arrives:

They charged me for two Balvenie pours even though I only received the one I ordered. The difference between the Balvenie 12 and the Belvedere is only $1.50, but it wasn't correct and I did not feel responsible for having to pay for what I did not receive. I called the waiter over and explained that the bill was off and the situation (this is now the second one who came to help resolve the issue in the first place) and after explaining once again what had happened he acknowledged and stepped away. No big deal, people make mistakes. A few minutes later a gentleman that I presume is the manager, as I do not recall him introducing himself or being remotely cordial to us as customers at his restaurant, came over to talk about the confusion. I then proceeded to explain once again what happened. After a bit of what felt like cross examination, I and my friends explained the situation about three different times. Once again, the difference between a shot of Belvedere and a pour of Balvenie 12 is $1.50! One of the concerns this gentleman raised, which I found the most ridiculous was the notion that the first waiter was now gone and couldn't confirm what happened as if we were only now raising this issue and had not already addressed it with both the first waiter and the second waiter who was still present. Also, essentially implying that we were lying and without another, obviously honest, witness to validate our story, we should pay this bill. He then stepped away for quite some time, questioning the bartender, questioning others to get to the bottom of what he seemed to be treating as our conspiracy to pay $1.50 less on our $88 tab. I stepped away to use the restroom because he took so long to come back. When I got back, I was told by my friends that the presumed to be manager came back again and once again argued stating he spoke to the bartender and they confirmed that apparently the entire night they only poured two shots of Belvedere and two pours of Balvenie. Shortly after them taking me through this (our laughter, fun and good mood on our one night together in Vegas completely eliminated) the second waiter came back with the corrected bill, apologized sheepishly, and walked away. For the record, I do not blame the waiter. I'm sure he was probably trying to reverse and correct the charge, needed a supervisor or manager to approve this and then we got Sherlock on the case of my nefarious attempt to come to Vegas, spend an average of $90 on each of my personal meals, average of $20 on each cocktail at the Cosmo and Aria (which I adamantly recommend over this place) and $100 on a ticket to see The Who, only to cut costs and even out for the weekend by stealing a dollar and fifty cents from the Grand Lux Cafe. 

(BTW, I just noticed the tequila shot was $18. If we were going to lie about a drink to save money, why wouldn't we go for the $8 savings instead of the $1.50 savings? $8 would have almost covered the tip I still left for the waiter).",0,0,0

All I remember was that it was heaven.  My wife thinks I'm crazy because I kept talking about how good my breakfast was the entire day.  In fact it was so good that we went out of our way to go back the next day for breakfast.

Unfortunately I can't comment on other menu items but the menu was large and varied as others have already mentioned.  Also, the portions are big.

Yes, it's similar to the Cheesecake Factory with their menu diverse and offers almost everything. But not to worry, despite their vast menu, the quality of food has NEVER suffered! The portions are huge but I never take it with me simply because my hotel room lacks a fridge and microwave for reheating purposed. The salads are always on point, fresh & crisp and not doused in heavy dressings. The pastas are always rich and creamy, and the sandwiches and appetizers are delicious.

OK, so hankering for something of substance in the sweet department, we wandered over to Grand Lux Cafe. (There's one fairly close to my place, but I've never gone --- for what that's worth.)

They offer chocolate chip\/pecan cookies. In a box. Sounds good -- and they are. But, so ya know: Once we ordered them, the server told us it takes between 16 and 18 minutes. Verrrry specific. No problem. However, after not seeing them for, say, between 25 or 26 minutes later, I wondered what was going on...?

Meantime, my double espresso came, and that was just fine. 

At last, the box o' cookies came and they were ..... pretty good. But only luke-warm. Now, of course, these babies have to cool. However, it's apparent they were ready, and cooled, and they simply didn't get delivered in a timely fashion. (Sigh) Not a deal-breaker, but certainly a bit of a let-down.

Almost any meal I've ever had here can be shared by two.

A nice warm crusty loaf of bread is brought to the table to start. For my entree I tried something new last night, Indochine Shrimp & Chicken ($19) & it was 5 star. The flavor was out of this world: onions, ginger, cranberries, sun-dried cherries in a plum wine cream curry sauce served with rice. I ate a lot but I didn't even get through half of it. My friend had Parmesan Chicken (under $20) & he agreed with what I told him I had thought in the past: best he's ever had. He also had more than half left-over. 

While eating we saw a monster strawberry shortcake dessert get carried past us & my friend had to try that-delicious. I had the waiter bring me an eclair from the bakery attached to the restaurant. Again, leftovers.

Though I gave GLC 5 stars, if 4 1\/2 were an option I'd have demoted it. Or if I have the same problem with the waitstaff again I'll give it 4 stars: The wait for the entree & then the dessert was very long. Our water glasses were never refreshed. I wasn't asked if I wanted white or brown rice with my dish. There's another reason I might demote GLC in the future: it's quite noisy & tables are crowded pretty closely together.

Long story short, you better hope you don't get the redhead, Sierra, as your waitress. And the manager on duty was just as terrible, if not worse. Let me tell you why. 

Now don't get me wrong, my boyfriend and I have ALWAYS loved dining here in the past. But this time around, I don't know what it was that changed but we certainly left HATING the place.

We came in on a Wednesday night. 
My boyfriend and I were seated and we found our initial server to be quite awkward and seemingly uninterested in obtaining our orders. After about 20 minutes of waiting he finally comes around and tells us they were undergoing a shift change and asked if our new server had been around yet. Nope. Nothing yet. But that's fine, should be understandable given the shift change, right? He then takes our orders before he leaves.

So our initial server leaves and we literally waited another 30 minutes before our food came out, and it wasn't until 10 minutes after that some lady decides to finally come and ask how everything is tasting. I'm sorry... but who are you? Oh that's right... you must be our server? 

At the table across from me I observe a lady and her husband getting just as irritated with the lack of service from our same waitress and elapsed time waiting on their food.

Fast forward all of the ridiculous waiting and our almost non-existent server, she finally comes around to give us the bill. I had never been so irritated with such service or the lack of in my entire life, and I am usually the patient one between my boyfriend and I (might I add, we also used to be servers too).

Silly me, I decide to take it up to the manager as we are leaving... And he could not be any less disinterested! Sierra comes along to see what's going on (because I'm SURE she knows what crappy service she delivered) and as I begin to complain she just gives me that ""I don't have time for this"" look and is dismissed by her unapologetic manager. 

He showed no remorse, whatsoever. All I did was complain about the lack of service and a simple apology would have sufficed. My boyfriend and I have BOTH been servers in the past. I don't care if you're having a bad day, you're just slow as heck, or running behind... You still say SORRY.

Now I don't know if the manager just didn't take me seriously since I didn't wear my ""big girl"" pants and heels that night (maybe he thinks I'm just some child trying to get comped for a meal, who knows??). But as a current nurse and past waitress I would like to see how he would feel if he were my patient\/customer complaining about his issues and I just stared at him blankly with no remorse or reaction.

Don't spend too much money on there, just get something quick, like a salad (size-wise was huge!), the mojitos were bad; sugar loaded no twisted flavor, what kind of mojitos are these?

We stayed in the Venetian and the Grand Lux is as convenient as it comes for Venetian guests. Right below the rooms, around the corner from the guest elevators and open all night.

When we went, it was 3:30am, we were all buzzing, tired and STARVING. We were sat rather quickly, despite the line, served water and menues, had our orders taken, then left alone... For forever. 

After about twenty minutes, a waitress swooped by and dropped some bread on the table. We get bread?? About forty-five minutes after that, we're all falling asleep on our table and our waiter comes by to apologize for the wait. He said everybody ordered breakfast all at once and the cooks are overwhelmed. Understandable enough... Until we looked around and no one in the restaurant is eating. If they're cooking, shouldn't SOMEONE be eating?

Fast forward another half hour and we decide to cancel our order with the waiter and go upstairs, right then, of course, our food shows up. 

Now, there are 260+ reviews that will tell you the same thing, but just to be another to say it, the food was delicious!! Of course it was delicious! I was a little sad that I couldn't finish it all. I got the Chicken Flautas, they were crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside and the avocado sauce was just spicy enough. It's apparently one of the more popular late-night orders, along with the Buffalo Eggrolls, which I was told were also kind of perfect. My friend that ordered the Egg White Omelette said it was THE BEST omelette he's ever had. That's as good as it gets, literally!

Ugh, I should've known better not the order noodle soup here.  I mean, some of their other Asian dishes are good, so I wanted to give it a try.  Nope, wrong! 

However, the server recommended the crispy shrimp and chicken rolls, which tasted excellent!  It was hot and crispy, and had a side of a tangy sauce.

  Grand Lux Cafe is the upscale brand of the Cheesecake Factory. The restaurants are upscale with decent prices. They include a bar and bakery.

 The Cheesecake Factory website states that the Grand Lux Cafe came into existence when the Venetian asked David Overton, who was the founder of Cheesecake Factory to design an upscale restaurant for his resort. The story goes that he went all over Europe doing culinary research. The research resulted in the very first Grand Lux Cafe-where we had lunch this afternoon. 

  Our experience was that Grand Lux Cafe is upscale and affordable. Our table overlooked the extravagant Venetian. 

 In my opinion, where the menu shines is the lunch special. It is from 11 to 5. The lunch specials include Lunch soup\/ salad ($10.95), Rustic pizza & salad ($11.95), Lunch salad ($9.95-11.95), Lunch enchiladas ($11.95), Lunch pasta & salad ($10.95-$11.15), and Lunch salmon ($13.25).

  I was going to order the Lunch pasta & salad. When I asked the Waitress if the lunch portion is enough to fill you up, she answered that depends on your appetite. With that nebulous answer, I ordered the BLT with french fries. I don't think this was the kind of dish that David Overton was researching in Europe. Overall I was happy with the food.

  I enjoyed having lunch in Grand Lux Cafe. I was off from work and with family. It is not too often that I get to have lunch in Venice. It was a change of scenery with good food that I appreciated. I am showing this appreciation with a 4 star rating.

The servers have always been very attentive from initial order, to drink refills and checkout.  

I've tried a variety of the meals here.  The Crispy Caramel Chicken is outstanding with a bit of sweetness to go with a little kick.  The steamed rice accompanies nicely.  The Buffalo Chicken sandwich, the Club, Chicken and Waffles, and several salads are a big hit as well.

One tip: Order a dozen cookies when you first sit down and they are delivered to your table warm when you get ready to leave.  Excellent!

I drive past the location at the Beverly Center all the time and never once thought about going to eat here. Well, I dove in and was pleasantly shocked.

The bread they bring your table isn't shabby either and one thing is guaranteed that you will walk out of here feeling like you just tackled every item at a Vegas Buffet. 

The concept here is to put you on the brink of a food coma so you plant yourself at a roulette game after eating and you just play for hours because you cannot move. 

The only thing that stopped this place from going 5 star is the slow service. The place is always busy so if your in a hurry to dine then steer somewhere else. If you have a minute to kick back and recycle some energy then this is your place.",6,1,3

Visit date: September 24, 2011
First time? Yes.

I did like their bread; I'll give them credit for that. And, I guess if you're going in a big group, there is a good variety on the menu. But I should have known to stick to simple things (like fries) because Grand Lux is from the makers of Cheesecake Factory (of which I'm not a huge fan). 

I tried the Rustic Lasagna with Chicken. First of all, lasagna with chicken just sounds weird, but I thought, why not? It looked good when it came out, but it wasn't lasagna. It was cannelloni. Why not just call it what it is? It had the potential of being great -- meat, cheese (how can you go wrong with cheese?), spinach and mushroom. But, it lacked flavor!

Other dishes I sampled:
Salmon Three Ways -- It was dry and salty.
Crispy Sesame Tofu -- The tofu and snap peas were good, but the Szechuan orange sauce was pure salt. Also, I'm not sure where the ""crispy"" plays a role.",0,0,0

The highlight of our meal was the exceptional service we got from our waiter, Mike. He was friendly and personable and checked up on us regularly. I don't usually take note of server's names (although I should start to), so that means he did a really good job.

This one is the only one open 24 hours, with a 24 hour bakery where you can get great desserts and the regular menu items to go. Don't go to the front desk for to-go orders!

This place reminds me of Cheesecake Factory, which is nice feeling kinda nice going to get food after a drunk night at 3 in the morning. They seated us pretty promptly the first night we were in Vegas around 3, got us drinks, and our orders were taken right after. Props on the service, especially the water guy, I never had a glass half empty, good for good mornings after. 

Got the deluxe burger, Just a normal burger with lettuce onions tomatoes and chipotle mayo with fries. It did take a while to get all our orders out, bread could only last us so much, haha. But the burger was bomb, and the fries, and my friends really enjoyed their food. they do have so very decently large portions, pretty sharable, so head up if you're not starving. Prices are cheesecake factory prices, so don't expect to get like 3.99 steak and eggs. For my burger and fries it came out to about 12 dollars with tax and gratuity. 

To go is really worth it since you get the same thing without paying gratuity. a little longer wait, but still the same quality food. Got the deluxe burger again, and they give you more fries to-go. I'm down!

Definitely hit this place up f you're near the Venetian and need a late night meal. Hella good!",0,0,0

The ambiance is sublime, 
and your food is simply divine.

The service can be a little slow, (-1 star)
you'll probably be so hungover you won't even know,
or notice because the breakfast buffet,
is probably cheaper than Mandalay Bay's.

""No!"", I must disagree,

My girlfriend and I went to this place numerous times and it's no secret to any of our friends that this is one of our favorite places along the strip.  The food is decently priced, the drinks are expensive (it's the Strip after all), and the menu is ginormous.  

I've never had a bad dish here.  Seriously.  And I've ordered all sorts of stuff on this menu.  The food portions are not for normal human beings, but for 9 foot tall giants who work out five hours a day.

Let me tell you why.....

1)  24\/7!  It's open all day long!  Great food and open all the time... nothing beats that!

2)  Truffle burger!  OMG!  First time having this burger and it was out of this world!  Huge patty of beff topped with mushroom after mushroom!  And not to mention the truffle aioli!  So good!!!  Probably one of the best ""Mushroom Burgers"" I've ever had!

3)  Calamari\/rock shrimp appetizer!  This is one of the reasons why I return to Grand Lux Cafe!  Such a big portion for less than $15!  Comes with super generous portion of calamari, shrimp, zucchini, and onions!  It's just so delicious!

Just a couple of ""could be improved"" points....

1)  Iced tea:  They have the normal kind... unlike Cheesecake factory, they don't have the tropical iced tea.... they really should have this....

2)  Service is inconsistent...  We had a nice waitress then she has to leave for her shift... then the person who took over for her was no where to be found... although she was nice as well but it takes forever to get service and attention of the 2nd waitress.... they will need to improve on this....

1. Pretty easy for you to get in very quickly on almost any day. There is also a location on the Palazzo side near the elevators to the rooms that is a little less busy.

2. The theme of the restaurant and even the menus scream Cheesecake Factory to me, but the restaurant has very much it's own character.

3. Open all night! A great destination to unwind from post-clubbing shenanigans.

I love the Grand Luxe Cafe because the times that I've gone there, the servers are not only friendly and willing to give suggestions, but also they are efficient and quick.

Vegas is all about moving from one place to the next, sleeping, and then starting all over the next day. Grand Luxe offers the time for people to cool their heels with decent, quality food. My girlfriend usually orders a pasta dish, while I always try something more adventurous since we're always on a vacation.

It's so sad, but they took away one of my favorite menu items, a carribean style jerk pork chop dish. It had amazing textures and flavors through it, but I guess it wasn't really a popular choice among diners. Anyways, back to other foods, you will always leave Grand Luxe stuffed since the portions are huge and the food is pretty yummy.

One of the things that I really like about Grand Luxe is the price. Though it's $15-18 a plate, the food is still cheaper than dining at most of the sit-down restaurants across the strip. Furthermore, it's not like we waited for more than 10 minutes to get into the place. If it is too busy, and you are willing to do a bit of a walk, you can get to the Palazzo side that sees much less customers.

Anyways, I hope you guys try out Grand Luxe Cafe!",1,0,0

When you're in the Venetian and looking for a place to eat, you got high-end, food court, and their Grand Lux Cafe.  Just from the gold decor, attentive well-dressed attentive servers, and the ambiance, you'll start thinking this is a pricey restaurant to eat at.  Nope...the Grand Lux Cafe is very affordable and the prices for their cafe\/grill food mimics a local Denny's or IHOP.  But that's the just the prices that mimics these chain branded restaurants.  Food quality, presentation, service, and selection is all top notch here at the Grand Lux Cafe.  In other words, you cannot go wrong here.

Grand Lux Cafe serves everything from breakfast to high quality meals like Filet Mignon.  Such a huge selection, I had to ask the waiter to give us extra time to decide.  In the meantime, we got our bread served and it was killed in minutes. For dinner, we shared the calamari which is also served with fried vegetables and fried shrimp.  I don't eat vegetables, but there's something about fried vegetables that makes it go down better.  The calamari was delicious, lightly breaded, and wasn't rubbery.  Yes..I've had overly chewy and rubbery calamari, but not here.  Cristina P. had a salad and I got the Crispy Chicken Sandwich with a bowl of soup.  Let me add that there isn't a Crispy Chicken Sandwich on the menu, but all you have to do is ask and sometimes you shall receive.  My chicken sandwich was exactly how I expected it to taste...chicken breast that's golden fried, crunchy, tasty, and perfectly sandwiched in a hamburger type bun.

""It'll be ready in around 22 minutes sir.""

""Huh."" *turns around and stumbles off back into the casino*

22 minutes later (what was I doing that entire time?) -- I'm handed a massive bag with what appears to be an astronomical amount of food...like takeout for a family of four. Oh holy hell what have I done?

So I trek up to my room at the Venezia tower and I settle myself in front of the sunken living room area TV...two of my friends are urging me to unload my Santa bag of goodies. ""Dude...I think you're drooling, but I don't think you're going to get in on this...""

So out pops two separate bags with generous portions of fries, a box with a ribe-eye steak, and a second box with pasta carbonara in it. Haha. I'm so happy.

So naturally, I just ditch the fries and go right for the steak. Now, it was more like a medallion, than a good hearty helping of rib-eye. Relatively tiny portion and to my disappointment was too chewy and well done. Didn't help that I had to cut it with a plastic cafeteria knife. Bleh.

I then move onto the pasta. This is where things got good. I mean REALLY good. Who would have thought that the pasta carbonara with no peas, bacon bits, and a creamy garlic cream sauce that night could be so magical? I tear through the entree like a homeless man tasting food for the first time in weeks.

Grand Lux Cafe, I'll be back. And thank you for being open 24 hours. I will not settle for a penny-saver meal at McDonald's, even if I am broke and $200 in the red on my Mastercard from casino ATM cash advances. I am so excited to try the duck meat pot-stickers next time.

(2) House Green Salad - mixed greens and heirloom cherry tomatoes tossed in their roasted tomato carmalezied onion vinaigrette $7.50. - A very nice presentation with an excellent salad dressing. I was happy with ordering this salad.

(3) Cafe Beef Wellington - Filet Mignon Steak Medallions Covered with Crimini Mushrooms and Topped with Warm Puff Pastry; served with Madeira wine sauce, mashed potatoes and vegetables. - This was delicious!!! So so so good. I would definitely come back here to order this again. Eating the pastry with steak was just a delight and the sauce had just the right amount of kick.

He was entertaining a big group sitting next to me. I asked if another waiter can take my order since I was hungry, but she insisted that I wait for my waiter.

Not only is the food scrumptious, but the menu is as large as the average American.  It's causal, flexible, and you can have whatever you like, however you like it, whenever you like it.  Poached eggs and a burger at 2AM?  The Grand Lux can make it happen.

The food at the Venetian location tastes noticeably better.  We had the Manhattan salad here once and the shrimp came juicy and grilled (which wasn't the case at the Palazzo location). My recommendations include the sliders, the miso salmon, the grilled veggie pizza, Chipotle avocado burger, the spaghettini with clams, and the calamari.  The calamari merits its own sentence--we're talking squid, rock shrimp (think mini shrimp tempura), zucchinis, and onions.  For the price, it's basically the best calamari you'll ever get.

Now, the Palazzo location has better desserts (the dessert menu is almost entirely different).  I highly recommend the molten chocolate cake (see my pictures and you'll know what I mean).  The Palazzo location, at least during the afternoon, also had a smaller menu listing mini appetizers (around $5 or so).  We tried the haystack which was similar to the regular calamari appetizer, but stripped of the seafood--just onion strings and zucchini slices.  The result? A vegetarian delight and now one of my new favorite fried appetizers to get!  We went to the Venetian Grand Lux the next day hoping to order the same thing, but alas, no mini appetizers there.",9,6,6

We've been here 2 days and ate here twice.  We got in late the first day and were looking for something reasonably priced that was convenient.  My wife had heard of it before as they have locations in other cities.  We live in Houston and there is one there.  We started with the Volcano Shrimp.  I believe they were supposed to be spicy, but were not in the least bit. That being said they were delicious.  They were fresh and perfectly battered.  They had an Aioli on the side which you didn't need, but complimented the flavors.  For dinner, I had braised pot roast with pan roasted carrots and broccolini.  The cut of pot roast was huge and tender.  It had a little fat, but not too much and it added extra flavor.  The gravy that came with it was awesome.  It comes with a creamy horse radish, but I asked for mine on the side.  I like to get the creamy mix and add a lot of the raw horse radish to the creamy mix to make it spicy.  My wife had the asian salad.  She said it was yummy and fresh.  For dessert we shared a strawberry cheesecake which was tasty.  The meal was about $60, before tip.

For breakfast the next morning I had sausage links, hash browns, scrambled eggs, and sourdough toast.  The sausage was great.  Everything else was standard as it is with hash browns and eggs. I took a pancake from my wife and it was delicious.  My wife got a ham, havarti, onion, and spinach omelette, with hash browns.  She said it was nicely seasoned and didn't need to add anything to it.  This means a lot coming from her.  As she is heavy handed with seasoning.  Many times I have seen her add salt before tasting.  I'll eat the same thing and think it is good without anything extra, while she is adding a fair amount of salt.  The meal was a shade under $50.

I was attending a conference at the Venetian for several days and I ate here everyday. I can't believe I haven't written a review. When my family came to meet me in Vegas, the first thing I said was, ""You have GOT to try this place."" The only reason I'm writing a late review now is because I found an old receipt from the Grand Luxe and now I'm sad because I miss my Chicken Madeira. 

First, it's conveniently located within the hotel (for you guests) and not a far walk away from the meeting\/convention rooms (for people like me). There was no wait the several times I went, although it was busy but the space is large enough to accommodate indoor seating and artificial outdoor seating (it's not technically outdoors because you're outside of the main restaurant but still within the walkways\/slot machine of the hotel and people are walking by as you eat).

Anyhow, let me tell you.. first let's start with the FREE bread.. my enemy. I love eating the inside soft part only and leaving the crust, and my colleague likes eating the crust and not the inside. Something for everyone.

As for the menu, everything is delicious.... except for this fish dish that was too lemon=y and I sent It back and ordered something else. I thought it was just me but my colleague ordered the same thing and sent it back also. They were gracious about it. The servers are all friendly. Maybe they hate you on the inside but they don't act like it on the outside. 

Next, the portions are HUUUUGE... Yes, it could cost $15-20 for some plates (my madeira chicken and pot roast were each $18.95 according to my receipt) but you could split it with 2 people or take it to go and it's totally affordable. I have a HEALTHY appetite and I would always have an actual half of my meal to go because it was so huge. That is always a plus in my book when I can eat until I'm about to burst and still have enough leftover to feed me for another meal.... 

The prices are extremely reasonable. I'm looking at an old receipt and apparently my thai fried chicken was $12.95 and a kids mac n cheese was $5.95. Definitely reasonably priced. Considering the portions and quality, it is worth it. A large selection of comfort foods, pasta, Asian inspired dished with an American flare, etc... definitely something for everyone, including kids. This is like Denny's or IHOP's older, fancier, more handsome, brother...

Anyhow ended up okay, all 3 of us held it down. 

2nd night I was drunk and made up drama in my head.

I have been a satisfied patron at both locations (the one at the Palazzo and the Venetian) several times before, however, this particular visit was just truly horrible.  Our waiter was absolutely dreadful ... he was about as useless as the guy at the Genius Bar at the Apple store when you're asking for help and you happen to NOT have an appointment.  Our food arrived way way late, in fact, the people on the table next to us were being served their dessert by the time we got our entree ... and they freaking arrived and ordered several minutes after us.  Our drinks were neither refilled nor removed once we were finished with them ... and none of our small appetizer plates were removed during the entire length of service.  I realize that this is no MIchelin star joint ... but come on we deserve better than that. 

As for the food ... well, it's difficult not to dislike it given the service or lack thereof.  The calamari was pretty much just eating fried batter or as my friend would describe it ""deep fried tire parts"".  The miso salmon was under-seasoned and just plain inedible .. as well as the shrimp scampi that I had the misfortune of ordering.  Funny thing is, I've had these dishes in the past and I know they can be good ... but this occasion must've been Amateur Chef night in the back.

I will never go back to this place and I advise the rest to avoid this place the same way you would an unleashed dog that happens to be foaming at the mouth with it's owner nowhere in the vicinity.

I stepped up to the plate as I was debating between the Grand Lux & the new burger joint Rattlecan. I opted for the tried and true and struck out several times. 

I had no wait to be seated and as I was guided to my table I almost wiped out as I slipped on the greasy floor in front of one of the kitchen door. STRIKE ONE!.

After studying hard to read the menu in the very dimly lit back of the resturant I decided on several items for dinner.

FOOD ORDERED:
Salisbury Chopped Kobe Steak 
House Green Salad 

A guy (manager?) came to me about 10 min after I ordered and told me that the chef did not like the look of the kobe beef, and would not serve it customers. This tells me that they didn't have any kobe beef. Regaudless, I had to pick another choice now almost 20 min into the trip.  STRIKE TWO!

FOOD Re-ORDERED:
Chicken Royale and Shrimp Scampi
House Green Salad

House Green Salad ...  my salad and it was very good the blue cheese dressing was exceptional (although they charged me extra for it)  4****Stars

Chicken Royale and Shrimp Scampi ...

This was not like any scampi I'd ever eaten nor was the chicken although tender very ""royal"".  Both tasted ok but I was not thrilled with what I got. The Mashed potatoes wer good as were the beans even though they were cold.

I finished my meal, the buss lady took away my plates and I waited for my check. And waited, and waited until I finally flagged down another waitress who said she'd inform my waitress, and I waited some more. Finally after 15 min I got a check then had to wait 5 more min for her to run my card. STRIKE THREE!

Started with a ""Paul Bunyan"" sized Latte.  Very good.  Then I ordered the corn beef hash and eggs.  HANDS DOWN, the best CB Hash i've ever had.  Sure its pricey, but its rare to see REAL chunks of shredded corn beef.  Not minced and ground like mush, but chopped strips of beef.  Damn....it was that good.  Throw in a couple of fresh eggs over easy, and wheat toast with preserves.  Definitely in my top 10 breakfasts of all time.

I really liked the decor and seats.  All oversized so it was a big thumbs up for me....especially for those who are 6FT and over.... I was comfy.

The portions are huge and I could barely finish half. It was not that good the next day to say the least. The butter cream had solidified into a chunky rock-like state.

I ordered what I usually order at Cheesecake--the miso glazed salmon lunch special! Alway good and filling. Huge portions, even for the lunch size. 

Apparently they have a weekend brunch that goes until about 12pm, but they keep the food out until 12:30pm. If you're interested in getting a full breakfast while at the Venetian, this is the place to go.  We opted just to order from the normal menu.

My sister asked her if it was the same. The server continued with it's the same thing just smaller portion. It came out and was only chicken and my sister asked where was the shrimp. The server Susan R said u didn't specify chicken or shrimp. My sister isn't confrontational so she didn't say much. But said she was never asked before on chicken or shrimp because it is Cajun chicken and shrimp jambalaya. So the server tells her she will make another one. The the manger comes over and ask what happen? My sister proceeds to tell where the disruption in communication could have happened and the manager walks away before she even finishes like she wasn't interested in the story, but does say well They rushed to bring a new one. 
We orders cookies the lady said they take 30 minutes. They came out hard and cold mine were slightly warm but hard . The manager explained that the cookies come out that way and they let them sit to cool down. Some were burnt. So your telling me you send out slightly burnt cold cookies? I continued to tell her how I was here I was here on the 1st and had better service better cookies and she dismissed it and started walking away before my sister could ask for another. We didn't even get bread to the table until we asked for it and it came with food. I've been looking around watching people get bread right away and Susan Has continued to check on them and we weren't getting that same service we got half her attention because she didn't even care to bring bread or explain that the dinner and lunch portions are different entirely. I won't be coming back here. This is located on the strip there should be better service.

I asked the manager if the difference in the service was based on race and she immediately shut me down. She said no. Yet myself and I are the only ones of a different race not being treated the same. No one asked if we needed boxes, how the food was, if we needed anything else. It was like pulling teeth. We present with a clean appearance. We have manners. Went to college. There is nothing outward that is different than our skin colors but we were served after people that arrived after us.

It was served with very creamy, good tasting mashed potatoes.  We shared a piece of chocolate cake for dessert.  It was huge.

Service was a bit slow last night, but we got here at the height of the busy time with people wanting to have dinner before going to see Phantom as was the case with us.  We had plenty of time and I didn't obsess with the time factor because I knew we were good.

Our server boxed our leftovers--dinner tonight--and brought it back quickly.  I had time to walk it to the car in the garage and put it in the cooler I brought anticipating a take out box or boxes.  I wish they had more large small plates on their menu.  Or if they would just downsize any of their meals for a downsized price.

My only complaint with Grand Lux is the level of the music.  It was not on when we first arrived. 10 minutes later, someone must have realized and they fired up the sound system.  At one point, it was so loud, I had to almost yell for my wife to hear me.  It got so bad, I downloaded an app for my iPhone and the decibel level averaged about 85 all the time we were there.

The salmon was disappointing.  The fish itself was dry, overcooked, and not flavorful.  The accompanying veggies and sauces weren't great, either.  They came with a similar tasting batch of mashed potatoes.

Ive stayed at the Venetian for one of my most recent trips to Vegas for a week..and just about every meal I had was from the Grande Luxe!

What Ive had:

appetizers:
Mini chili cheese hot dogs: hit the spot after a night of dancing and drinking at Tao, but dont u dare eat em if u cant hold down ur alcohol and food!
Duck pot stickers: very yummy, dont really taste the duck meat due to the spicyness of the Hoisin sauce. 
Asian Nachos: such a cool play off regualar nachos. the chips are made from wontons and there is peanut sauce which is spicy and sweet! there is also wasabi cream which is daring but sooo good. This appetizer is good with a beer!

Burgers:
The Max Burger: Omfg!! burger effin heaven, I swear to you! Angus beef topped with short ribs, bacon, mushrooms and cheese! So delicious, I wanted to order another..but there was no way I was going to finish it! 
Santa Barbara Chicken Sandwich: Delicious, but nothing will top the Max Burger. 

Entrees:
Jamaican Pork Tenderloin: The presentation is so pretty, you dont want to eat it, but then your senses kick in and you start grubbin! With every bite of the tenderloin top off your fork with a little of the sweet mash potatos and mango salsa..your tongue will thank you!
Fried Chicken: An overload of delicious chicken tenders! 
Crispy Caramel Chicken: Spicy from the thai sauce, but there is caramel that blands down the kick of the spicyness and makes it a bit sweet. 
Chicken Royale: if you want to play it safe, go ahead and pick this. simple and delicious.

Pizza: 
Margherita: Yummy with a huge beer! The pizza bread is very thin and super crispy.

Simply put, the food is delicious. Be a risk taker and order something that sounds daring with the fusions of sauces, you wont regret it. 
The presentation for all the plates are lovely.

Somewhat brasserie in design with gold garnish and heavy fabrics plus a ""patio"" on the casino floor it was moments to seven on a Saturday morning that our trio was seated overlooking the Venetian's lingering late-night revelers alongside the morning check-outs and with immense menus soon perused selections were made - a sweet and gluttonous affair slow to arrive and marred by slow refills as staff seemed to be idling into shift change.  Admittedly more than a little puckish when plates were delivered nearly forty-five minutes later it was with relieved but bemused smiles that the three of us first laid eyes on the constituents of our $80 affair and although what was ordered would have been better suited for a half-dozen, the majority of it was worth the wait - an aggressively spiced carrot cake loaded with nuts plus shredded coconut and some of the thickest custard-drenched French Toast I've found both amongst the city's best.",4,1,4

PROS:
-  Located inside the Venetian.  That's a pro in my book since no matter where I stay in Vegas, I always end up somewhere near the Venetian.
-  Place is open late!!  Is this place 24 hours?  I'm not sure, but I love the fact that you can go clubbing and come here afterwards.
-  Service is fantastic!  We got our food efficiently, everything came out for our group together, and she was attentive.
-  Food quality is just delicious!  I got their Chicken Carbonara and it was so creamy.  Bacon bits in there were thick and juicy.  I could have licked the whole plate clean.  Bread they give you was also fluffy and chewy.  Yum!! 
-  Ambiance is beautiful!  It's like Cheesecake Factory but a notch fancier.
-  There is so much variety with food selection, so this is perfect for if you are in Vegas with a group.  Everybody can find SOMETHING to order on the menu.

CONS:
I have none!  That's why this place is getting all 5 stars from me ;)",3,0,1

We had to catch the Wayne Brady show in the Venetian (excellent btw), however, so we stopped here beforehand.  It was a less than 5 minute wait at around 6 pm on a Monday (no reservations unless more than 7 people).

The menu is marginally different from Cheesecake Factory.  The restaurant itself is huge, and has better decor than the Factory (or was it that I was used to gaudiness since I was in Vegas?).  What I tried:
Indochine Chicken and Shrimp:  I tried to get my bf not to order this because I figure we shouldn't go ""ethnic"" at a non-ethnic restaurant.  I'm glad he went ahead and ordered it anyway.  I suppose Indochine is a social construct\/concept anyway, and not really ethnic... ok back to the food.  It was a good!  A bit sweet for my taste, but definitely way better than I expected.
Creamy Chicken Soup:  Yum yum, how can you go wrong with soup?

My boyfriend, the mojito addict, ordered 2 of them for $11 each.  That's more than they charge at the Factory, just to let you know.  Basically, this place was better than any Cheesecake Factory I'd ever been to, but I think they overcharge for their drinks.  For what it was though, this is a 4-star.

My curiosity struck me because I've been a Cheesecake Factory employee for quite some time now and haven't got to try the sister restaurant yet.

First night: Mandarin Cosmopolitan and Spicy Calamari Salad.

The salad sounded like a good option because it just tied together some interesting flavors. The vinaigrette seemed to be missing, but the spicy sauce had a kick. Mandarin Cosmo was made with an excess of sweet and sour. I have a feeling they missed the Mandarin part. If you pay $12 for a martini, it should be semi-decent. Because for $2 more in Vegas, you can pay a bartender who knows to make your drink...

Service was not bad - our waiter had a lot of pep to his step. Red bull gives you wings, definitely.

Second night: Buffalo Chicken Rolls

For those familiar to Cheesecake, this is the Buffalo Blast's step-sister. Nothing great to note about the dish. Service was lackluster.

Also, there was an annual meeting for AAOS at the Venetian, and everyone had decided to go eat at this restaurant. However, the wait was only about seven minutes, which was awesome!

We decided to try the lunch specials, but we were concerned that the portions would be small since normally at a nicer restaurant like that, their portions are not filling. 

I ordered the Lunch Rustic Pizza and Salad ($11.95) with a Mango Margarita ($10.75). My friend got the Lunch Chicken Special-Chicken Parmesan (~$12.95) with a Strawberry Margarita (also $10.75). 

When our plates came out, we were shocked at how much food we were given. We were full by the end of our meal. Would this be filling for the average-sized man? Probably not. But it is a good-sized portion for the price.

Grand Lux Cafe is the spitting image of its sister, from the wait to the menu to the quality of food and service.  I've also eaten at the one in Beverly Hills.  All consistent.  It was Christmas dinner time in Vegas, and we were headed to the one at the Palazzo, but we came across the one in the Venetian first, and since it was only a 20 minute wait (unheard of in Cheesecake Factory land) we stayed.  Our server was nice and we got apologies from both her and the manager for the long wait of our food.  Hell, I didn't care as long as I had my pomegranate martini ($13) to sip on, and some warm bread and butter to munch on.

I had the spaghettini w\/ clams and rock shrimp.  Very garlicky and yummy.  I thought the pasta was a little on the dry side, until I got down to the bottom of my plate (yeah, it's a lot of pasta), where all the olive oil and white wine goodness had coagulated, probably from sitting under a lamp for awhile.  Anyways, it was good and I'd order it again.
My petite friend ordered the ""max burger"" which had everything on it including bits of beef shortrib (are you serious?!).  She managed to eat half of it, said it was great, but suggested that seasoned and\/or curly fries would have been a better partner than regular fries.  Someone else ordered the fried chicken which looked like it could have fed our whole table.  It was served with mashed potatoes, snap peas, broccoli, and sweet potatoes.  It must've been delish cuz she ate all her sides before getting to the chicken.  The least favorite meal at the table was the pasta carbonara.  Bland and made with cherry tomatoes, which she didn't like.  I took the little cherries and added them to my dry pasta which was actually a good pairing.  

And just like the Cheesecake Factory, we didn't have room for the cheesecake or any other dessert.  That was my bad.",4,3,3

Surprisingly, they had their own version of pho called Zen Noodles.  It was like a ""fancy looking"" pho, the broth was served separately on the side and it had more noodles than meat but it was good enough to satisfy our craving, although really not worth $14.

The primary reason I'm only giving two stars is because the wait time was horrible.  We got there around 3 AM, which was well before the club crowd so we were seated immediately.  After we gave our order though, we had to wait an eternity to get our food.  It was like that for all the tables next to us too.  Our waitress was apologetic and kept reassuring each table our food would be out in a couple minutes but a couple minutes ended up turning into an hour.  I get that it's busy but I can't imagine how long the wait would be for the people that came after us who actually had to wait in line for a table.  In total we were there for 2 hours but only 15 - 30 minutes of that was actually spent eating while all the rest was spent waiting (for our food, for the bill, for them to take our credit card...).

The place is huge, decor is awesome, menu is extensive and food is ALWAYS great!  My review is on their breakfast buffet.  Its not as huge as your casino buffets but the food is higher quality and simply awesome!  There is an egg\/omlete station....the omletes are soooooo yummy.  They have bacon, hash browns, sausage links and as of this year now have ham.  There is sour dough bread, english muffins and bagels which you can toast.  The fruit is much fresher than in your traditional buffets.  My only somewhat of a complaint is the pastry selection needs an little makeover.  They have had the same selection for years now and it gets a bit boring.  Oh and also as of this year they have belgium waffles which were great!!!....the chocolate chips to sprinkle on made them super good!  Another plus is you get ALL the beverages you want included in the price.  I know this is relatively standard in buffets but where do you get FRESH SQUEEZED orange juice?  NO ONE has orange juice like the Grand Lux!!!

Despite our huge group, service was punctual but no effort was made to be friendly. Water glass was full and food arrived in a timely manner.

The best part about Grand Lux is that there is something on the menu for everyone. From pasta, to steak, to fried chicken and waffles; yes, your picky eater will find something. 

Our table ordered several appetizers, and the crowd favorite was the asian tacos. A must-try if you're looking for just a tad bit of an adventure!

And although my company was footing the bill, I was still peeved that many of the drinks (beers on tap, mixed drinks) did not have a price associated with them on the menu. 

I ordered a plain old (or so I thought!) caesar salad for dinner. It was under the ""small salad"" listing, but it was definitely large enough to share between two people and certainly big enough for an entree for one. I only ate half of mine. 

Overall, this was a great choice for a large group because of the diversity of the menu. With all the other great places in Vegas it wouldn't be my personal first choice, but certainly it's a crowd pleaser!",0,0,0

I got the molten lava cake which is a chocoholics dream. The vanilla ice cream is necessary to cut through the richness of the chocolate. The apple pie my friend got was more like an apple tart which she ended up liking better than if it was in traditional pie form. Since our group was from New Orleans we got a kick out of seeing beignets on the menu so of course we had to order some. About half of us thought the beignets were pretty decent, but not to be compared to a New Orleans beignet which are not as doughy and never served with sauces. That being said, their version of it was still pretty good so we aren't knocking them. The coffee was also good and strong which was the perfect pick me up we all needed.

We dropped by at an off time (2:30PM) but the place was still very full and busy. We had an early dinner planned so we opted to share a few appetizers and had drinks. We shared the spring rolls, crab cakes and strawberry shortcake dessert. Note: even though it says ""spring"" rolls these are more like egg rolls and deep fried. The inside is kind of a mushy texture so it wasn't obvious that it was chicken and shrimp. The crab cakes were surprisingly good, with each (two per order) a good size and filled with a generous amount of real crab. Mustard-y sauce was a great tangy complement. Strawberry shortcake was huge with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream in the middle and topped with whipped cream and strawberries.

Though I can't afford it very often(...er, often... eh...ever...), the Venetian is undoubtedly my favorite hotel on the Strip (which probably contributes to my fondness of Grand Lux)!  On this trip, we caught a late dinner here post-Blue Man Group...

Location-wise, the ""patio'd"" dining area of Grand Lux has a great view for people watching, looking out upon the escalator landing that meets the casino floor to the parking structure and shopping center.  And the people watching here is excellent... the sexy, the desperate, the suave, the chic, the buffoonery!

The interior\/exterior is inline with the vibe and feel of the Venetian, simple-chic , with notable designerly touches of old-country influence and theme .  

Grand Lux is by no means a fancy-shmancy bistro.  It is, in essence and actuality, a well-dressed upscale Cheesecake Factory affiliated establishment.  And for the intent and perspective of casual ambiance, generous portions, affordable dining, it's well suited...

The puree'd Butternut Squash and ginger soup was a great start to the late night meal; delicately sweet with a subtle tartness.  Only one person had ordered it, but it was so good, she insisted on passing it around amongst the five of us.  It was that good...

I had the Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich;  sharable serving of four triangular flatbread sandwiches set atop a platter of fries.  A smokey-spiciness from the chicken and the pepperjack cheese is offset by a cool avocado-corn salsa.  I ate half and saved the other have for breakfast.  Also around the table was the chili-cheese topped jumbo Kobe Hotdog (w\/fries), the Braised Pot Roast dinner, and the Chicken Royale (w\/ white wine butter sauce)... everything tasted good (the cool thing about foodies, if they've got something good, they like to share!) 

Our bill for the food (sans drinks)?  Just north of $60.

It's one of the better (if not one of the best!) casual after-midnight menus on the strip... with the bonus of watching an entertaining  parade of people.",4,0,1

The hostess seemed to be a a foul mood.  She didn't greet us or smile.  She tried to seat us by the bar next to a bunch of loud drunks even though the restaurant wasn't busy when we arrived and there were plenty of empty tables in quieter parts of the restaurant.

Service was mediocre.  It took a very long time for our food to arrived.  The server and a manager came to apologize about the delay at least 3 times.  The least they could've done was offered us an appetizer while we waited. Our server was OK. He was pleasant and helpful, but never smiled.

Bread: Over baked and hard as brick.

The rest of the food was actually good and they redeemed themselves in that area.  We ordered the seafood salad, southern fried chicken, seafood pasta, and fish and chips.  The pasta, the salad, and the chicken were great! The portion, flavors, and presentation were impressive.  

I wouldn't recommend the fish and chips it tasted grainy and dry.

Sometimes what is lacking in Vegas is a middle ground restaurant, especially in Venettian. You want a restaurant atmosphere, but don't want to pay $200 just to have a meal for two. Yet, you don't feel like paying $15 for a greasy Philly Cheesesteak at the food court. Grand Lux is your middle ground restaurant. Its owned by the creators of Cheesecake Factory and its basically the same to me. Different menu, but still diverse and extensive. Perfect when you need something casual and have a lot of mouths to feed.

My first experience was very pleasant. I had the most attentive, kind, and honest waiter I've had in years....and...he was new!  When I first ordered, he made sure my party knew that the portions are generous. Personally, I like it when they're honest that the portions can be too much and sharing is encouraged for people with smaller appetites, even though it could affect their total tip.

I ordered a pasta and requested for no olives. The kitchen made a mistake and added olives so they had to redo it. I never saw the plate with the olives because my waiter caught it before it was delivered to me. He apologized repeatedly for the tardiness, but I was fine since I wasn't in a hurry and he was just so nice...its hard to be upset. The manager also came over to apologize at one point. Finally, I got my pasta. I just wish they would clarify that it was chicken chorizo on the menu, it makes a difference since I was expecting large chunks\/slices of chicken.

I ended up tipping the guy almost 25% in cash and wished him luck before he left. He was such a doll, I would take him home.

Second time I went? Disaster! Snobby waiter who was giving us horrific service. Ignored us most of the time, didn't like the fact that a couple members in my party wanted to share a meal. When he was passing the meals over, he wouldn't even lean over to hand me mine, he just held it up in the air and I had to reach for it. Didn't refill my drinks until I was getting ready to leave! What's the point then? Didn't even give our party a basket of bread unlike the tables surrounding us. Lazy!

However, I think he's just the bad apple of the group. As my previous waiter was great and the manager wasn't bad either.

I would still go here just because it is nice to have something in the middle for dining, plus the menu accommodates just about anyone that's with you. I just hope my service is as good as my first visit.",1,0,0

I see that many have mentioned that the food is like Cheesecake Factory but i think this place is much better and the portion size is ridiculous. Every entree can be shared between two people comfortably and the best part? The price is just right. 

Came in here with a group of 6 on a Saturday night around 7:00 PM and was seated within 5 minutes. Next came the complimentary bread- omg, probably some of the best sourdough bread i've ever had. The bread was warm, the inside was soft and the outside had just enough of chewiness and crunch. Our group ordered the lettuce wrap, the pizza, the salmon and chicken terriyaki, the fettucini alfredo and another pasta dish. Eveyrthing was delicious and none of us spent more than $15 dollars each(with tax and tip already) - not to mention we all had leftovers for after-clubbing grub at 4 AM. 

To top it off, the service was awesome. Our waiter was honest with us about the portion sizes and encouraged us to share- not like the typical waiters that roll their eyes when they know you are sharing. He also offered to split all of the checks for us and even went above and beyond to split the shared items among the pairs. There was a 18% gratuity charge on our check but almost all of us left him extra tip because he was so awesome!!!!

Asked the waiter for the kitchen to not add any extra salt to my food. A simple request. The Waiter was very pleasant and said it would be no problem. After around 10 min the manager came over and said the home fries were fairly salty, and it would take a little longer, but  she was having the kitchen freshly grate and prepare the potatoes without any salt. Thought this extra touch was so wonderful. Worthy of 5 stars! But that's when this tale takes a very different turn...45 minutes went by... still no eggs and home fries. I asked both the waiter and manager why the long wait. I Was told it would be right out. What I received after waiting almost an hour were three extremely rubbery hard yolked fried eggs (ordered over medium) obviously sitting under a heat lamp for quite some time). The ""freshly made"" home fries had the entire crunchy browned top removed and were extremely salty. So basically the kitchen took conventional home fries and removed the top, rather than making fresh, hoping it would go unnoticed... UNBELIEVABLE!!!. At this point, I was angry and hungry, got up and decided it was time to leave. Once again I spoke to the ""twenty something"" manager who professed her apologies and then had the audacity to say to me ""Ok we won't charge you for your meal"". REALLY!!!!!'
There was no consumption...I just cut into the eggs and saw they were inedible, then tasted the home fries, which I immediately spit out.  I ended up getting a yogurt at the Venetian store. Will NEVER EVER go back to this restaurant again!!! So many great places to eat in Vegas, do yourself a huge favor and go elsewhere! Grand Lux SUCKS!",0,1,0

I've seen reviews comparing this place to Cheesecake Factory since they're sister restaurants or something like that... But my family and I are kinda meh on Cheesecake Factory and we all loved this one.

We came with a huge group (friends and family) for my cousin's bachelorette party dinner. I think it was a total of about 30 of us? So taking our orders and getting the checks to us at the end were a little insane, though our servers were good-humored and managed us well.

My boyfriend and I ordered the Creamy Spinach & Cheese Dip, Chicken Pot Pie, and the Baked Rigatoni. MISTAKES. We definitely could've gotten away with ordering just the appetizer and an entree... or even a single entree between the two of us. Portions are huge.

That being said, the food itself was pretty good. The spinach dip came at a great time since we were starving. I loved the rigatoni, though my boyfriend thought it was a bit too salty for his own taste.

If I could redo this experience, I would order less and save myself room for dessert. I would've loved to try their beignets or molten chocolate cake.",1,1,1

The first time I came to this restaurant, I had never been to Cheesecake Factory.  I did not realize that they had humongo portions.  This was my first visit to Vegas and my first encounter with Grand Lux.  I ordered the ahi tuna salad to start, then I ordered a full entree (which I don't remember at all, probably because I barely ate any of it).  I had NO idea the ahi tuna salad was so huge.  It is a meal in itself.  Everything here is huge, but consistently tasty and fresh and on par with the cost of everything else in Vegas.  In retrospect, I am kind of wondering why the waiter\/waitress who helped us didn't warn me that I was ordering *WAY* too much food?  

My husband's favorite sandwich is the hamburger that is topped with bbq shortribs and fried onion strings (or something like that - it's a major meat fest).  Their menu is very eclectic with a vast array of choices (fish, meat, pasta, asian fusion, etc.), much like Cheesecake Factory - except they don't have advertisements scattered throughout it.

This last visit in June, we only made it to Grand Lux for brunch.  We shared a stack of dinner platter sized pancakes and shared an egg white omelette (filled with mushrooms, cheddar and ham) with toast and hash browns.  Yummy and definitely large enough for us to share.  This was the cheapest meal we had on our trip to Vegas (somewhere around $30 for two)

We also sat in the 'outside' area where you can do some serious people watching since you are right on the outskirts of the casino near the entrance towards the Sands convention center and the bank of elevators that takes you to the main hotel tower.  
The interior is nice as well with roomy booths and regular tables.

Service is efficient and courteous.  Definitely no complaints.",3,0,0

We had lunch at the restaurant last Spring while scoping out venues for our intimate wedding.  We noticed right away that they had a private dining room that had a podium and audio visual capabilities.  We decided in June to have an August wedding, and decided on the Grand Lux after discovering that their banquet prices were the most reasonable out of all the Las Vegas Strip options.  Yes, it's an upscale Cheesecake Factory.  I happen to enjoy the Cheesecake Factory.

I sent an inquiry email to the restaurant and received a phone response less than two hours later from Rich, the Events Manager.  He promptly emailed me a list of dinner options along with prices.  Even with the ""plus plus'-es (tip, gratuity, etc.), the per person costs did not break the bank!  Rich also provided his favorite meal options as well as the ones that his customers enjoyed the most.  For the record, we settled on the Filet Mignon ($10 extra), Miso Salmon, Madera Chicken, and Pasta Fresca (for the vegetarians).

We met with Rich and his banquet staff two days prior to our reception, where we handed off our wedding favors and gave instructions.  Rich had our printed menus with meal selections and it looked fabulous.  We decided against bringing our own centerpieces since it was a destination wedding, so they agreed to put flameless votives on the tables.  We were already impressed with their hospitality and our event hadn't even happened yet.

Onward to our wedding day...the room was beautifully set up and Josh and Karen took over all responsibilities.  They showed us how to work the sound system and attended to all our needs.  Our guests complimented on the menu selections -- the filet mignon seemed to be the favorite.  I'm not sure I can adequately describe how the Grand Lux Cafe went above and beyond the call to make our wedding reception everything we wanted it to be.  You will not find another place on the Strip that will treat you like royalty without running you into wedding debt!  If I could give them more than five stars, I would.

I highly, highly recommend the Grand Lux Cafe  at the Palazzo Hotel if you are looking for a private intimate (less than 80) wedding reception.  Call Rich and book your wedding reception there today!",1,1,2

I thought the ingredients would be scrambled into the omelette, instead the mushrooms and cheese and scallion were mixed together separate of the egg omelette. The egg omelette wAs just laid over my melted mushrooms and cheese. The omelette lacked any flavor. The hash-browns were tasty. The toast was good with butter. I ordered a tea it was pretty pricy for a plain tea bag. 4.25. But it's Vegas so shouldn't be surprised.

I've been coming here for years and used to get the wood planked salmon until I discovered the pastas. I've tried all the pastas and have been extremely pleased with them all.

This means you're going to have tons of variety, a massive menu, and some good free bread.  We had to wait about 5 minutes for a table (a massive rush came in after us).  The space is huge.  There are so many tables in the back area, so the fact that it was full at 4:30-5 p.m. is a good sign.  We had some edamame to start, which was nicely seasoned and came with a great dipping sauce.  I ordered the fried chicken, which came with creamy, delicious mashed potatoes and coleslaw with peanuts.  The whole thing was delicious.  I think I ended up with about 5 pieces of fried chicken, which was a lot, so I was unable to finish it.

A little tip for those going, if you are wanting to conduct business or use your smartphone in the back area where most of the tables are, you're going to have a hard time getting a signal.  This could be good for conversation with family, but potentially difficult if you're trying to conduct business.

I would highly recommend this place.  I was a little nervous going to a sit down place at the Venetian because you never know what the pricing will be, but the Grand Lux Cafe was very reasonable.

From what I remember, we ordered the chicken pot pie, pasta telephono, and chicken Alfredo. Though I don't remember what the other two ordered, I do remember that all of us left that place unsatisfied and quite disappointed. --Chicken pot pie had a great flaky crust, but the filling was boring, bland, and watery. 
-Pasta telephono was extremely cheesy (too much for my taste) and had an extremely weird and unexplainable taste. Definitely not recommended. 
-Chicken Alfredo was just an average chicken Alfredo, nothing exciting.

Service was pretty average and the place was decently crowded, considering the fact that it was a pretty big place. We dined at around 8 on a Tuesday night.

Went to the one in Houston several times and fell in love with it (except the high-ceilinged bus station design and corresponding noise level), so was glad to find they opened one in the Venetian...and then opened one in Palazzo next door soon after. Kind of weird to have the only two GLC's in Vegas so close to one another, but they don't seem to suffer for customers, so that's a good sign. I'm reviewing the Venetian one because we've been there more, but both locations are equally good.

I agree with the majority of the reviewers here- the menu is huge and caters to every taste (even vegetarians - and vegans - three items, I think), the portions are large and the specialty drinks are quite good. My favorite items are the chicken piccata, wiener schnitzel and Thai chicken pizza...even when here for brunch, actually. A couple of items are similar to the Cheesecake Factory (southwestern salad, Asian chicken salad, jambalaya, chicken parmesan) but are presented in a more upscale manner and larger portion size. What is definitely different from the Cheesecake Factory is the dessert tray- the beignets, peach cobbler, bread pudding, various decadent chocolate delights and fruit tarts are definitely tempting, but five types of cheesecake are also served here for ""traditionalists...""

As a Vegas local, I'm always on alert on the Strip for the all-too-common management vibe that says ""We cater to tourists- and can cut corners because we know most won't be back no matter how good the service is."" We come back here so often (both locations, but primarily the Venetian) because never has waitstaff ever seemed like they were anything but glad to serve. Sometimes there can be a backlog of orders and\/or customers and things get delayed, but our server has always come over to apologize, give updates and the occasional extra bread basket, etc. 

Four stars rather than five because the prices for some items are indeed higher than other comparable restaurants on and off the Strip, and the wait can sometimes be 30-40 minutes...sometimes at times you'd expect (weekend evenings and Fridays) and other times you might not (a Tuesday evening in December, a Monday morning in July...) But if the wait at this location is too long any given day, it's a 10-minute walk to the other one in the Palazzo where the wait might be shorter...and vice versa.",0,0,0

The Calamari the first time was super salty, so we tried it a second time. Much better.

BUT IT'S OKAY, because he apologized profusely and gave us a complimentary dessert at the end. The buffalo chicken sando itself was spicy and friend and huge and perfect, and I am certainly glad about his mistake. I also tried my friend's kobe burger and it was really, REALLY tasty.

Here is my top 10 list as to why The Grand Lux Cafe deserves the honor:

10. The menu is huge. If you can't find something that you utterly enjoy on it, go back to McDonald's.

9. The wait staff is always accommodating. You can substitute things and it will still come out the exact way you asked, on the first try. ( I have a picky mother-in-law and there are ALWAYS substitutions when she orders her meals)

8. If you are lucky enough to snag a seat at the bar and want to eat there, they set you up right with all serving utensils and place mat. Plus, you get your drinks faster, score!

7.Seating. We never have a bad table, and comfy seats.

6. Plenty of tables. When a restaurant is as popular as this one, they need lots of tables and The Grand Lux Cafe has plenty. I have yet to wait over 10 minutes  for a seat, even on a holiday weekend.

5. Artichoke Dip. This is my favorite appetizer ever and the Factory does it well. Spinach, artichokes, cheese=Heaven.

4. Avocado Egg rolls. Really, I have no need to say more.

3. Cheesecakes! In every flavor imaginable. And they all rule! They even have sugar-free ones for those of us that can't have sugar. Yes!

2. Blue-cheese stuffed olive martinis! These little morsels rock and The Grand Lux Cafe hand-stuffs them. Mmm...

1. And Finally, Miso Salmon. I can't even find the words as to how great this dish is. The fish, the sauce, it is so freakin' good. I have been to the restaurant when they were all out of it (it has to marinade over night and they only make a certain amount) and I think I cried.

The place is really nice and it reminded me of CheeseCake Factory and to my surprise, I guess they're sister companies so yea.. and the service was good. Our waitress was really nice and our food came out pretty fast.

The  menu is pretty big and contains everything from craft cocktails, appetizers, tapas-sized dishes, sandwiches, burgers, pastas, salads, and the list goes on. The portions are huge and i'm happy to say that  i've never left this place unsatisfied with quality or taste. 

As an added bonus, there is brunch offered every weekend and the cocktails are sure to please. The Strawberry Bellini, Mimosa, Sparkling Rose, and\/or Spicy Mary will quench the biggest thirst and leave you with warm fuzzy feelings.

I've been coming here for several years eversince a bellhop from Caesar's Palace recommended to me and my bestest gal pal one late night back when I was 21 yr old young buck. 

- Love the beautiful atmosphere (appropriately located in the Venetian)
- Love that it is 24 hours (good for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or late night snack)
- Love that is from the makers of the Cheesecake Factory (Lot of similarities)
- Extensive menu (so much to choose from it can be overwelming)
- Great food (Most of the dishes I've tried are pretty good)
- Excellent food presentation (kinda that fancy smacy stuff that you get wooed by)
- Good portions (wooh....don't think I've finished a whole meal)
- Decent prices (avg meal range anywhere from $8 - $18)

****BUT...I am tempted to give it 1 less star due to my experience the week before heading Vegas. I called to two seperate times to make reservations for a group of 20. I was put on hold for over 10 minutes and just hung up since I was so frustrated.

Nonetheless, due to convenience our group decided to still  eat there since we were staying at the Venetian over the weekend. When calling from the hotel room (making sure to emphasize I was a guest at the Venetian), I quickly got reservations and hardly waited. A bit shady.....guess that have high priority for hotel guests. Good thing to know in the future

When we got there, we got a long table in the back where they usually have big groups. One long table and it was spacious and private for a bit. SERVICE was excellent. They had two waitresses serving us. So Grand Lux  I guess I forgive you just this once better not let this happen again ; ) ******

Just to note: My friends ate here 3 times when in Vegas since it's the best deal around in the Venetian and still one of the nicest and most decently priced places on the strip.

It is the third or fourth eclair I've had in three days in Vegas and it's the only eclair that was 1) really good and 2) worth the money. The other eclairs I had were just about as much money ($3.95) but this one was four times bigger, filled with a ton of custard AND whipped cream, was covered in just the right amount of good quality chocolate, and was filling without being too rich.

Generally for Grand Lux, we head towards to location closer to Palazzo, but the two is exactly the same.  Since we stayed at the Venetian this time around, instead of venturing out into the hot Vegas summer, we stayed on the Venetian property for the majority of the time and Grand Lux is a favorite among my friends, which also meant we ate a lot of Grand Lux.  There is a food court, but we weren't really feeling it.  

Grand Lux is good, especially for large groups because it is a huge restaurant and they can easily accommodate bigger groups.  The menu is also very diverse, from breakfast to Asian-inspired dishes.  It's owned by Cheesecake Factory, so I always thought of Grand Lux as a very expensive diner.

Went for the Chicken & Waffles, Short Rib Grilled Cheese Sandwich, and a Lunch combo for my visits this time around.  The Chicken & Waffles is a favorite of mine.  Belgian waffle that's topped with fried chicken strips and comes with this great brown butter maple.  The grilled cheese sandwich was the first time, and while good, it was just a bit too greasy for me.  Lunch combo with salad, soup, and sandwich is a solid choice for a little variety.  Grand Lux always have good soups at all times, and this time, got to try the Chicken Mushroom Cream, as well as the Chicken Tortilla.  The Chicken Tortilla seriously tastes like liquidfied nachos!  It's pretty damn delicious haha.

Also tried my friend's jambalaya.  Not even close to being the real thing, but not gonna lie, it is pretty damn tasty.  It's more like a stir-fried dish with cajun spices & seasoning!

The place is open 24\/7, which is another reason why we came here so many times in one weekend.  After a night out, Grand Lux.  Dinner?  Grand Lux.  Another night out, sure why not Grand Lux again.

Even without this extra menu there still are a lot of options that make your choices confusing. If I wanted a buffet I would be going to one of the numerous ones on the strip. 

We had a fairly large party for a wedding rehearsal. Now this can be quite a hard task to cater 18 people but they had numerous mistakes that were simply aggravating. 

Half of our table was completely ignored for ordering both the drinks and food. The appetizers were already coming to the other guests before we had to insist on ordering drinks. 

Also the food orders started coming out wrong as well. Appetizers were brought instead of the actual main course. 

Luckily however the food is fantastic. I had the Mediterranean Mahi Mahi and it was some of the most flavourful fish I have ever had. Everyone else at the table as well were raving about the food.

There's nothing special about their breakfasts. Despite the commercial channel they feed you in your hotel room. Their breakfast buffet was standard for any hotel.

The breakfast cocktails were also very good. Peach bellini, mimosa, and a pomegranate cocktail. They were on the sweeter side, which I like, but might not have enough booze for some. 

Although it's not a buffet, it is definitely a place to get your feast on. Portions are HUGE and I feel like they can actually serve 2. Prices are very reasonable (This place is from the founders of The Cheesecake Factory) for Vegas.

I was hoping to dine somewhere a bit more high end - but thems the breaks in Vegas. The cash tends to ebb and flow. Or in my case, just ebb. 

That brings me to Grand Lux. A good meal, with awesome portions at the right price. Yanette M (partner in crime) and I started with the seared ahi. We both loved it, and she's not a fan of raw fish. The wasabi cream was worthy of plate licking. I probably would've done it if we weren't seated on the ""patio"". For entrees, she went with the Cedar Planked BBQ salmon. Holy crap that was a huge portion. Tons of veggies, mashed taters, and onion rings. I took some nibbles from her plate and everything was very well done. I went with the pasta carbonara and side ceasar. The carbonara was delish. Done with applewood smoked bacon as opposed to pancetta. It was fab - but really you can't go wrong with bacon and a butter cream sauce. Just sayin. The salad was good and nice to look at, but a pain to eat. Once you coat romaine spears with dressing, they tend to slide around on the plate while you're trying to cut it. I'm a lazy eater. It's why I don't order crab legs. We each had a glass of wine with lunch. 

Overall, everything was really good. Service included. Except that it took way too long to get our app. I mean, 20 mins for seared ahi? That's not even cooked really. Also, the place wasn't crowded at the time - so what gives? Check came out to about $50 before tip. Definitely worth it.",4,6,3

However, between the hours of 2am-6am, the Palazzo's Grand Lux is closed, and that is where this other Grand Lux, inside The Venetian is clutch. I don't always stay out all night, and so when I turn in early (read: before 6am LOL), this is my go-to establishment for a night cap before knocking out. 

I was in town over 4th of July weekend, and came in early on one of the evenings, so I headed over to The Venetian to get some food to wash out all the liquor in my system LOL.

It was around 4:45am, and the place was busy (It's Vegas, what establishment open that late isn't busy on a holiday weekend?). Service was quick. I got seated immediately and the waiter had bread and water to my table within 2 minutes of being seated -- I like that. It's funny, because I think the waiter saw it in my eyes that I had just come in from a long night, and so he brought over 2 glasses full of water and not once asked if I wanted anything to drink beside that LOL.

 My late-night staple at the Grand Lux is ALWAYS (100%) the Chicken & Waffle. Always! If you don't know, you better ask somebody! LOL -- That is always a God send after a long night of partying and drinking liquor like it was water LMAO! 

I ordered the Chicken & Waffle and the Shrimp Rolls on this occasion, although, I will say, the rolls were overkill -- With the bread they brought out, and the Chicken& Waffle order, that was more than sufficient for me. I still grabbed a couple bites of the rolls, and I will say that while they were tasty, they couldn't overcome the greatness of the Chicken & Waffle. 

The waffle is always freshly done, great tasting with the maple syrup, and the chicken tenders oh so crisp, and delicious all-white meat. How could you not love this combo to end the night? I know I do. Both items I ordered were great tasting, and service was top notch, as always.

Cons:

-they say they have a ""soup of the day"" then return after about 15 minutes of you ordering it to tell you they ran out of ""soup of the day"" at around 7pm.  
-food takes a long time to come out, and the refills for your drinks take just as long... except when the manager comes to your table, the server shows up instantaneously to ask what's wrong and why the manager was at the table.

They have a little of everything! I almost always get the pasta with chicken and sun dried tomato. Awesome pasta. The other dish I usually get is the shrimp scampi. It tastes much better than the version at Cheesecake Factory--shrimp is bigger, and crispier too. The combo dishes of caramel chicken and shaking beef are good too, but in those combo dishes, the shaking beef has VERY VERY FEW pieces of actual beef. Its a tiny bit of beef and a crapload of sliced green onions. Oh, and for the appetizers, try the chicken lettuce wraps. Very good, but they make it look like the dish is full of chicken...its not. Its mostly those white fried crispy noodles. But for dessert, ALWAYS, and I mean ALWAYS, save room for the Beignets. Holy smokin frijoles they are awesome. The three sauces are great too...the Beignets are the perfect comfort food....they can grow back a limb! But BEWARE---the Grand Lux in the Venetian DOES NOT serve beignets, only the grand Lux in the Palazzo!!!",2,1,1

We decided to find somewhere convenient since there's a huge group of us and we were getting hangry, so down the elevators a few steps- we found this place.

We were greeted by a hostess that brought us to our table of 10. We had our drinks ordered by a waiter after 5 minutes.  My friends and I decided on the Grand Mimosa which has sparkling wine, Grand Marnier and OJ.  When it came out, the strawberry was very old and was going bad not only for my drink but my friends had the same issue.  The drink overall was so flat that I left it after taking 2 sips.. So I wouldn't suggest ordering this beverage.

For brunch- you can either do the Grand Lux Express, where it's a buffet style breakfast and you get to pick and choose what you'd like from bacon, sausages, eggs, crepes etc over at another room of the restaurant where it is hosted.  But I opted out on that and just got a basic eggs, ham & toast kind of meal.  Everything tasted fine, mediocre and nothing extravagant, I mean, there's nothing special about my dish anyway.  My friends seem to be okay with their dishes.  There really isn't much to complain about if you're here for a solid basic meal.  Wish we were here for lunch because I would much rather have that at 10am than my boring breakfast. 

Our server seems flustered because there was so many of us that it took awhile to get the orders in- delaying our food... And we didn't want to give him a hard time about the mimosa although 4 of us couldn't finish it. All in all, it's a place to eat- that's it lol.",0,0,1

We started with the Stacked chicken quesadilla. It was crispy and savory and stuffed with whole black beans, green chiles, tomatoes, tender moist chicken, melted cheese and sprinkled with kernels of sweet yellow corn *sigh*... really it was that good. I went with a lunch special. Had the pasta carbonara and a small house salad. The salad was, well salad. The dressing was tasty and the greens were crisp. The pasta was wholesome, rich and loaded with smoked bacon, peas, mixed with creamy blends of cheese. it was very fulfilling. After eating a slice of bread or two and a wedge of quesadilla I could only eat about half my pasta before I was full. Baby had the Burger Melt. It sat on some sort of garlic parmesan bread, had lots of cheese and grilled onions, I had a bite. It was very big and intimidating, great if you like meat. The fries were crispy and and not overly salted. They told us about their fresh baked desserts which we didn't have the pleasure of trying. Now as to the best, yes I'm saving it for last. The Grand Lux Peach Bellini *moan moan moan* OMG, seriously orgasm in my mouth. I could taste the bubbly but it didn't overpower, had a slushy like consistency, a nice big amount of peaches and a big ripe red strawberry to top it all off. I could've drank ten. Best ten dollars I've spent in my life. So fruity and refreshing and just a burst of joy for my taste buds, I'm going back for a few more as soon as I can.

We had to ask a person who was not even our server for BREAD. We were seriously all famished and were getting extremely grumpy.

After waiting what seemed like hours, we got our food. I got the combination of the salad\/fetucini alfredo and I was extremely eager to eat. Once I took my first bite into my pasta, I was disgusted with the amount of salt in it. I never taste such a salty pasta dish in my life! I thought I was the only one, but my friends tried and agreed it was extremely salty. My other friends ordered pasta\/salad combo and it was super salty as well! I do NOT recommend the nasty salty fetuccini alfredo. It was so salty I didn't eat it anymore. I do not recommend this place, nor would I ever go back.

I've always like the Cheesecake Factory for really one dish (Shrimp Scampi yay!) and one dish alone, and my initial impression of the Grand Lux Cafe was that they were a bit similar to Cheesecake Factory.  I didn't realize then, that they are owned by the same company...but I digress....

At the Grand Lux though, I found more dishes that I like (Ahi Tuna burger, Double Stuff Potato Spring Rolls, to name a few).

This particular location was located right at the base of the set of elevators to the Venetian hotel rooms.  And at the time, being a Venetian guest, it was just way too easy to keep coming back.  Was I mad about that?  Of course not, how can you be mad at good food within walking distance to your elevator bank?

I also appreciated their long hours.  I guess being a Vegas location and all, it was easy for them to open early (early enough for me) and stay open later.

But I guess do to the close proximity to the elevators and their long hours, they do get full fast.  Full enough to cause 2 long lines...which I never quite understood why there were 2 lines to begin with.  If you don't mind taking the food to go (which is the easiest thing to do when the line is too long) head over to the left area which kind of looks like a cafe.

Matt Timms, the manager, noticed that we were all cold and came over and offered us his jacket and other jackets he had in the back. He said he couldn't turn up the heater and knew there was a draft that hit our table and wanted to see if he could make it up to us with a jacket. So sweet! 
2) I was sick and getting over a cold. I ordered a hot water to soothe my throat. Jen, our server, was so thoughtful and brought over more things for my sickness including extra broth from a soup we ordered, and a hot tea to go with honey for my throat.
3) before we left Matt Timms sent us over a box of warm delicious cookies. They were sooooo delicious! I had maybe 4.... I mean vegas was almost over and it would be a while before I needed to fit into another skimpy dress.

I cannot wait to go to Vegas and Grand Lux again!",0,1,0

I think this is better than cheesecake factory. Despite the same ambiance, interior decoration, to-go bag color schemes, and menus, the food was a bit more tasteful than cheesecake factory.  
 
I ordered the pork chops and I was very satisfied with my choice. When there is a mixture of apples with pork chops and mash potatoes and brussel sprouts- I'm in! The pork chops was perfect- not over cooked, not under cooked near the bone. I enjoyed every morsel that was left to the bone. My friends had a bite of my dish and agreed that they liked my dish.   

The service was tentative. They were concerned with our experience which is surprising for our group of 13. Other places tend to neglect you knowing that they have a guaranteed 18-20% tip. Here, they asked if the whole party was happy with their choices.

This is the upscale version of Cheesecake Factory, so you will notice that the decor and menu is very reminiscent of Cheesecake Factory.  I love the food here and I love that it's open 24 hours!

This restaurant is located on the bottom level of The Venetian.  My friends and I were starving and got here around 1am to a short line.  Their menu consists of a section for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late night.  Dinner lasts until midnight and late night is from midnight to 6am.  Lucky for us, they said they were still serving up dishes from the dinner menu when we got there so we had a wide array of options to choose from.

My friend and I both ordered an ""appetizer salad"".  I got the Greek Salad and added chicken.  My friend got their spicy calamari salad.  When we got our plates we were shocked because it was still a huge portion!  I added chicken to my salad because I didn't think I'd be full off just greens, oh how wrong I was!  Neither of us were able to finish it.  

My two other friends split an entree salad called the ""Sheila's Dream"" and it was sooo good!  Seriously, a party in your mouth.  It had an eclectic blend of ingredients and the dressing was top notch, I'm gonna get that the next time I come.  So worth the $12!

Even though everything on the menu here is delish, I'd strongly recommend the Miso Glazed Salmon - best dish on the menu!!

As far as desserts go, their strawberry shortcake dessert here is excellent!  I'm inclined to say it is the best ever - it's fresh strawberries, shortbread, and cream all thrown onto a plate together so it isn't a sliced piece of cake like you'd find at other restaurants.

Don't overestimate the long lines, this cafe is huge and comes with lots of indoor and outdoor seating so the lines move fast. I'm so happy we got to try this place because it truly did not disappoint! What we ordered:

-Freshly squeezed grapefruit and orange juice: fresh and worth every penny! The grapefruit juice is a bit bitter for my taste but if you like the fruit, you'll like the juice. Served in wine glasses so the portions are on the smaller side.
-Grand lux french toast with strawberries: perfect! Six pieces of thick toast sprinkled with powered sugar, strawberries, and maple syrup.

Located inside the Venetian Hotel and Casino, the cafe is actually pretty easy to find just off the casino floor and near the escalators from the parking garage. 

items of note..

- the room is MUCH larger than it first appears from the casino floor! With high ceilings and plenty of seating, the room is tastefully decorated and feels upscale.
- Service is top notch here! At least it has been every time I have been here so far! For our last visit, Casey was our server and he was great! 
-For being a food outlet a)on the strip and b)inside the Venetian, the prices are incredibly fair! It's a great way to enjoy a nice meal and not feel like you're breaking the bank! This was probably the biggest surprise of all!
- the menu is HUGE! The amount of options available to you is fantastic!
- this staff hustles! I mean servers and bussers were in constant motion tending to a guest or prepping a table for the next party! 
- Casey was great about keeping drinks filled and checking in with us from time to time without being intrusive. It was perfect!


For this last experience, I ordered the rib eye steak(cooked medium rare) ($27). The steak was cooked almost perfectly! It was so juicy and tender and marinated beautifully! The garlic mashed potatoes were pretty tasty as well! The steak was so good that I decided to enjoy it without any steak sauce or ketchup(which I never do!)

He said it was all made ""for them"" and some other language that appeased us at the time, but disappointed us a bit when the food came and the pasta was obviously not fresh.  I know, we were dreaming to think we could get fresh pasta made that day for that price, but we were in Vegas, where my sister eloped and dreams come true, right?  On the upside, the pasta was not over-cooked and limp.

All in all a solid meal and I would go back, especially if I were trying to get decent food at a decent price on the strip.  This is almost as low a price as a place like Nathan's Famous hot dogs, especially if you share a main course, which the portion sizes will definitely let you do, but here you get to sit down and eat a nice meal.  For us especially nice, because my new brother-in-law bought us dinner.   Thanks Paul!",2,2,2

I always have a huge appetite and craving for fatty foods after I club or party.  Their gigantic bacon cheeseburger and sausage and mushroom pizza hit the spot. They were only $9.95 each too! I scarfed half of each down and somehow made my way up to the 10th floor of the hotel to finally knock out.

I was looking for something savory AND sweet on the menu like a Denny's Grand Slam, but surprisingly, Grand Lux didn't offer anything like that.  So I ended up just getting the red velvet pancakes with cream cheese frosting and added a side of eggs.  These pancakes were basically red velvet cupcakes, but flattened lol.  Julius had the chicken and waffles, which he thought were good, but preferred the soul food variety (ie regular instead of Belgian waffles, and chicken wings & drumsticks instead of just strips.)

Our food did arrive much later than everyone else's around us, and the manager was nice enough to come by to apologize.  He should've comped one of Julius' beers though, dammit!

Yeah you know it, this place is where to be at and be seen at after partying over at Tao. This has a big inkling resemblance to the Cheesecake Factory and that's only the case because it is a spin off of the Cheesecake Factory -- go figure! 

Their menu is HUGE. It would take me a good 5 minutes to read everything and decide what I want but the first time we came here, we ordered from their take out area, and the second time I came here, we just ordered desserts. Their cheesecakes do not hold a candle to the ones at the Cheesecake Factory but it was still okay at the time. I was more interested in the complimentary white and wheat breads to cure my hangover and fill my empty belly. 

The lady at the table next to use ordered Grand Lux's pot pie and the pot pie was bigger than her head. It was MASSIVE! I laughed when she tried to eat it.

The Grand Lux is owned by the Cheesecake Factory, so if you're familiar with that style of food then the concepts are pretty similar.  

The late night menu was trimmed down a bit, but they still had a good assortment of burgers, sandwiches, & finger foods, plus you could get breakfast dishes if you wanted them.  I just went for a grilled chicken sandwich and a beer, they were fine but our service was slow, and I didn't appreciate that the Grand Lux uses the same seating arrangements as the Cheesecake Factory where they'll seat you uncomfortably close to the next table.

There is another Grand Lux Cafe in the Palazzo but usually the Venetian is a lot closer for us to go to. They have a large variety of menu items that range from classic American food to different takes on various ethnic dishes. You also get bread and butter when you sit down. The reason why I like the Venetian Grand Lux Cafe more is that we get seated quickly. It doesn't matter what time we go or how big our group is. If you've noticed that Grand Lux and Cheesecake Factory have similar menus, they're owned by the same company.

When you order food, be prepared to eat. Their portions are big and you have enough to take back to your hotel room (if you have a fridge that is empty). I've ordered their bomb Caesar salad and I usually try different dishes when I go here. I had the Shaking Beef with Rice and that was pretty good. I usually get the Caramel Chicken and I can never finish it. 

When I recently went here with my family, my sister ordered the Beef Short Rib Sloppy Joe sandwich. It looked pretty good and it tasted pretty good. Usually all burgers come with fries. 

Service is always top notch. The last time I went here we ended using a Visa Gift Card that the server botched when he put in the amount. He ended up resolving it but was super nice about it. He wasn't giving us attitude. Their servers are always attentive and ready to ensure that your order is correct.  

Find parking in one of many parking garages in the Venetian parking lot. 

Order one of their signature lemonades and you won't be disappointed. They also have sodas and a full bar. A couple of years ago, my friend ended up ordering a double shot of Tequila for his drink at dinner.

Short Rib Grilled Cheese - see: ""joe, sloppy""

Southwestern Salad - if you really need a salad, you really can't beat this; word of warning, this is two meals, easy

Crispy Caramel Chicken - really nice asian inspired dish

Shaking Beef - really good riff on vietnamese shaking beef, with a really good sauce over rice

Indochine Chicken and Shrimp - second favorite dish; it has a really unique flavor that is slightly spicy, sweet and creamy all over rice, plus it has chicken and shrimp; try this one it is worth it

Chicken Salad Sandwich - available at the take-out counter\/cafe located near the main entrance of the venetian grand lux.

Surprisingly, you can get a relatively good sandwich for $7 in this cafe. It is pre-made but none would be the wiser once you put it on a plate and ditched the wrapper. My gosh! I can't believe that I just got away with paying $7 for a sandwich in Vegas and it tastes relatively good?!

Chicken Wings - tender and beautiful. So good I almost at the bones.

It was too late for a full lunch and I didn't want to fill up as I knew my friends and I were going have a big dinner in Chinatown. This place seems pretty crowded no matter what time of the morning, day, or night it is and there's usually a bit of a line to get in. Luckily for us we only had to wait a few minutes since it was kind of getting toward the end of the lunch hours.

I must say this is a pretty nice place....nice trendy looking cafe....dimly lit....with lots of table or booth seating. Immediately after being seated, our server came over to greet us and took our drinks order....nice and friendly guy. It didn't take long to decide what I wanted and I knew the portions would be pretty large, so my friend and I decided to split a chicken salad sandwich with fries. Not bad.....had pretty much all the fixins' and the fries were hot and fresh....my only complaint would probably be that it could've had more chicken salad filling in it.

We came back here again two days later for their breakfast. Before I flew out to Vegas, my brother had given me a couple of Costco coupons for either a free continental breakfast or the grand lux breakfast buffet for just $11+ (Usual price about $19+). Of course we went ahead and chose the breakfast buffet! It wasn't a huge spread, but good enough for a very filling breakfast....lots of fresh fruit. yoghurt, pastries, breads, a couple of hot food stations with hash browns, sausages, bacon, scrambled eggs, and waffles.....and there's an egg station for eggs made to order.....nice touch :) Drinks are ordered from the server separately, and OH WoW......the OJ is freshly squeezed and amazingly refreshing! For what you get for the grand lux breakfast buffet, it's well worth the regular $19+.....and is just an absolute deal at $11+! Yum!.....Very good breakfast!

I didn't even know this place is a sister restaurant of the ""cheesecake factory"" chain.  If cheesecake factory tasted this good, I'd go more often.

My fiance and I went exactly at Friday 12:01am.

Pros:  A sign of a healthy and good restaurant are full tables even at midnight.  After getting of the plane starving for something good, my fiance told me Yelpers recommend this place.  We were staying at the Treasure Island and this restaurant was located inside the Venetian across the street.

I loved our waiter Abraham.  He made us feel welcome, recommended some great dishes for us to try, and even went in the back to ask the chef the secret to preparing those wonderful mashed potatoes spring rolls! (I'm not imparting the secret, you'll just have to go ask the restaurant yourselves).

We tried the aforementioned mashed potatoes spring rolls, their flautas, and an order of their prime rib sloppy joes.

Everything was delicious!  I was all rejuvenated and ready to go back out there and gamble some more!

Cons:  So many choices, such a small stomach.  I couldn't have thought of anything wrong with the meal.

Bottom line: Next time I go back to Vegas and am craving a midnight meal, I'll so go back to the Grand Lux!",0,0,0

We came here at about 11:30 on a Tuesday morning for a late breakast\/lunch. They were just putting away the breakfast buffet, so seeing that I decided to order from their all day breakfast menu. My husband is a chef, formerly at a hotel, and warned me that it would probably be the worst time of day to be ordering a breakfast since the cooks are winding down from making breakfast probably since about 5AM. Stupidly, I ignored him and ordered it anyway.

I ordered the eggs anyway meal: two eggs, hash browns, bacon, and sourdough toast. Everything was bland and overcooked. My bacon was burnt and flavorless, the hash browns were dry, and my eggs tasted like rubber, and my toast was cold. I would have complained to my server if I could have found her. Unfortunately after a few minutes my hunger got the best of me and I ate the crap anyhow.

My husband's vegetable soup was not any better. He found several vegetable ends in his small cup, and TWO bay leaves. I'd hate to think how many bay leaves the stock pot had in it if two ended up in his tiny cup.

And as I intimated before, our service was AWFUL. We ordered at 11:40 and didn't receive our food until 12:15. And our server was nowhere to be found in the interim. I think she just waited in the kitchen until her orders were up, delivered them and went straight back to the kitchen to wait again instead of checking up on her tables.

Their breakfast includes an assortment of morning cocktails, omelets, pancakes\/waffles, and even an all-you-can-eat buffet. Had I left enough room in my stomach from the night before, I surely would've opted for the the buffet. Instead, I decided upon Joe's Scramble (ground beef, onions, mushrooms, spinach, a side of hash browns, and toast). 

""The menu says this thing is only $12 which means it is probably puny. I can make quick work of this."" 

Or so I thought. The waitress returned with a rather hefty plate of food. The eggs were packed with hearty chunks of mushrooms and onions and spinach, and ground beef. There was so much, I didn't even finish. Moreover, the scramble was pretty tasty! Eggs weren't watery at all, nor were they overcooked. The has browns were perfectly crisp on top and moist underneath. My only real gripe with the meal was that the toast was moist and flimsy. I was not a fan. 

Still, it was a pretty solid meal and I would gladly pay the same amount for an omelet, even back home. I'm glad this was our closest breakfast option. If you're in the area and looking for a morning meal, check out Grand Lux Cafe!",12,10,12

Yeah it is like an upscale Cheesecake Factory. It looked nice enough and was packed. Service was excellent. 

They bring out a warm loaf of bread while you check out the enormous menu. They're open 24hours and their menu is divided by times of the day so make sure you're looking at the right section. I ordered the Pasta with Chicken, Sun dried Tomatoes and Mushrooms. At first it was good but then the chicken was gone, then the tomatoes and mushrooms, and all that was left was a mass of pasta. I was already full by then but I wasn't really impressed by the dish. 

I got to taste the Sunday Night Pasta - ""Made Fresh Every Day! A Rich Slow Simmered Meat Sauce with Chunks of Beef Short Ribs, Steak, Fresh Mushrooms, Onions, Garlic and Parmesan Cheese. Served over Spaghettini."" Tell me that doesn't sound good. Good thing I didn't order it. The ""chunks of beef short ribs and steak"" tasted like shredded beef.

Scrambled eggs, smoked bacon, ham, grilled tomato, and Havarti cheese on grilled brioche bread. Probably one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had!

I arrived around 6:00PM after cruising the G2E Global Gaming Show all day. The restaurant was crowded but, thankfully, there was no wait to get in.

I was promptly greeted by a friendly hostess and was offered a seat in the Bar area rather than the main restaurant. (I'm glad they didn't seat me on the casino terrace as I don't like that area at all -- mostly because the scent they fill the casino with is obnoxiously strong there.) There are two TVs in the bar -- one was tuned to a sports channel while the other was tuned to the first presidential debate.The restaurant areas I visited appeared clean, fresh and well-cared for. My table and seating area were also clean and the table was set for two. I was given a glass of water, a 1\/2 loaf of their amazing sourdough bread and a generous serving of butter within just a few short minutes of being seated.

My waiter, Charles S., was very friendly and attentive and he wholeheartedly agreed with my choice of dinner: Pasta with Grilled Chicken, Tomato, Basil and Mozzarella. The large main dish portion was made with fresh ingredients and presented nicely on a large clean plate. There was lots of tasty, well-prepared pasta with a tomato, cream and garlic sauce; a generous portion of flavorful grilled chicken breast; and many appealing small orange and red pear-shaped ""mini"" tomatoes. The dish was garnished with fresh mozzarella cheese, grated Parmesan cheese and a basil pesto. The menu claims the tomatoes are roasted but mine did not appear that way. A very delicious and filling dish. The iced tea I was served also passed muster though the refill I was offered was a tad strong for my liking.

GLC is owned by the same company that owns The Cheesecake Factory. I have eaten at many GLC locations across the country and I'm always happy with the facility, food and staff. The price for meals is a bit on the high side (my dinner this evening with tax and just over 20% tip was a tad under $26) but well worth it for the quality of the experience.

I have only been here after midnight and yes, that is when MAGIC happens. The waiters are usually fast, attentive, and accommodating. Once I ordered only a variety of BREADS.

I have not yet to try here for breakfast yet. It is quite hard to wake up early in Vegas.

I have one check in here but it's only because I just started to use Yelp. 

I have been going here EVERY SINGLE time I go to Vegas. I usually go to Vegas almost every month. My regular order is Pasta Telephono. It is basically pasta with marinara with bread crumbs on top. If you want chicken, its extra! This pasta reminds me one of the Corner Bakery's pasta with breadcrumbs. (I can't recall the name). 

I have also tried the Baby Back Ribs. Their portions are HUGE. So if you go with one person and have small appetite.... I say order one plate and share and get an appetizer. 

I have also tried their Eggroll on their Appetizer Menu. The sauce to dip that came along was so tangy! Loved it. Pasta Pomodoro is also something to try!

Two of my dining companions had Bloody Marys that were made just right -- spicy but not too.  One had a frozen Margarita that was well made and not overly sweet.

We stuck with appetizers on this trip, and the best of all were the crab cakes.  No doubt the best I've had with lumps of crab in a well seasoned mixture lightly grilled.  

We ordered the appetizer combo and enjoyed the following:

Vietnames Spring Rolls with chicken and fresh cut veggies in a steamed, cold wrap served with peanut sauce or spicy sweet and sour sauce.  Philli Cheese Steak spring rolls with diced steak and cheese in an eggroll wrappper fried and served with chipotle mayonaise.  Also eggroll style was the buffalo chicken served with the absolute best bleu cheese dressing I've ever had.  My husband's favorite were the steamed duck dumplings.  The Spinach Artichoke dip was creamy with plenty of artichoke.

I had never been in the Palazzo before, nor had I ever eaten at Grand Lux Cafe, so I was super excited to experience both. The cafe is easy to find coming off of the parking garage elevators, it's a quick jaunt across the casino floor. We were sat right away by a pleasant hostess and received a booth as requested. The decor is beautiful in this cafe and the ceiling is simply stunning. It is a work of art, very beautiful.

Here's some pros & cons during my visit:

PRO's
1.) Large food selection
2.) Delicious, complimentary bread basket
3.) Great wait staff - courteous, helpful and kind
4.) Fantastic pot roast French fry appetizer (I recommend), yummy Manhattan salad and penne with a silky, smooth alfredo sauce
5.) Huge portions, easy to share

CONS's
1.) Food brought out wrong the first time and had to wait while they remade it
2.) Very pricey - think upscale, Cheesecake Factory
3.) Large food selection - I spent 20 minutes flipping through this huge menu trying to decide on something to eat
4.) The server we got was not knowledgeable on the menu. I asked simple questions like ""what pasta does this dish come with?"" and he didn't know.

All-in-all, I would definitely visit again for lunch, however I don't see myself coming for dinner service. I can see how this is a great spot for tourists or hotel guests though. Make sure you have more than a 1 hour lunch before eating here. It does take a bit of time.",1,0,2

  Service was great.  My friend has nut allergies and made sure to let our server know that. Her salad arrived full of almonds,  so our server comped her salad for the inconvenience. 

Overall the dining experience was great. Everyone enjoyed their food, it was fresh, hot, flavorful, and large portions. We had buffalo chicken rolls (a must for buffalo chicken fans), entree salads, miso salmon (I recommend subbing the rice for mash potatoes) jambalaya, chicken n waffles,  and a sandwich. 

This place is definitely a go to when in town especially since the location in Los Angeles closed down.",0,0,0

I got the Garlic Shrimp Pasta and my boyfriend got the Carolina BBQ Sandwich. Garlic Shrimp Pasta was close to $20 but so worth it.

So we proceeded to walk in and get seated and a very friendly waiter took care of us. We ordered some stiff drinks, 2 Scotchs, on the rocks. Then while my grandfather 'carbed up' with a clam pasta dish, I went for one of their big salads; in this case it was their Chopped salad - grilled chicken, bacon, tomatoes, blue cheese, avocado, egg and mixed greens. The whole thing was tossed in a vinaigrette. 

The food came out from the kitchen in under fifteen minutes. The clam pasta dish according to my grandfather was very tasty and the clams very fresh.

I had a Grand Lux Omlette for breakfast, which came with asparagus, Artichoke, Oven-Dried Tomato, Portabella Mushrooms and Havarti Cheese. I asked for the hollondaise sauce on the side.  Also came with choice of hashbrowns or tomatoe\/lettuce and choice of bread. I went for the tomatoe\/lettuce and an english muffin.  It tasted perfect!  If you like cream cheese, ask for some because they make it fresh and boy it is gooooood!

As for the other two meals, I had the the Manhattan salad for dinner. The portion was huge, I had to take half of it to go.  It was a chopped salad with Romaine Lettuce, Asparagus, Tomato, White Beans, Fresh Beets, Red Onion, Peas, Lentils and Assorted Vegetables tossed in Our House Vinaigrette with chopped fresh turkey and cheese.

The other meal was the sonoma salad which didn't stand up to the Manhattan.

I went the first time because it was near my hotel and was relatively affordable. I went the second time because the first meal was that good.

The GLC gives off the vibe of an upscale diner. It has a large and diverse menu, which covers all sorts of different options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It's also open 24 hours. The price point is really reasonable for LV - anywhere from $10-$20 for the average meal. The server also told me that the pasta portions are gigantic, though I didn't have pasta when I was there.

The first time I went to GLC was on a weeknight. It wasn't busy, and I got a table immediately. I ordered the Grand Lux Burger Melt with fries, which was quite delicious. The burger was cooked very well. The fries were a little soggy, but not too bad. The portion size was reasonable for the cost. They also give you bread as you're waiting for your meal, and the bread was freshly baked and warm, which I appreciated.

The second time I went to the GLC was on a Friday for lunch. The place was packed with a line out of the restaurant. However, the line moved fairly quickly, and I got a table within ten minutes of getting in line.

I ordered the chicken and waffles, and let me tell you, that was outstanding. Huge waffle. Really flavorful and moist chicken. The Pecan Honey-Butter Sauce was delicious, and the waffle itself was covered in pecans to add some texture that I enjoyed. It was also very reasonably priced for lunch fare.

Why am I not giving this a five star rating?

Simply, the wait time from the order to having the meal served was too long. On Tuesday, I waited at least 1\/2 an hour to get the burger, and on Friday, it took even longer than that. If it's busy, I can understand that. The size of their menu, which is quite massive and diverse, certainly adds additional challenges. However, the place was dead on weeknight and I still waited too long. That knocks it down a bit.

Otherwise, I'd definitely recommend it.",0,0,0

In fact, after wandering around the casino one night we even discovered that there are two spread out between both the Venetian and Palazzo hotels. Our experience dining at the Venetian Grand Lux Cafe was overall very good as we were able to get seated right away and the quality of our food was perhaps even better than expected. We began with buffalo chicken egg roll appetizers, which were incredible and highly recommendable as a starter that would also pair well with beer. I decided to order a garlic shrimp pasta dish and my partner in crime ordered a strip steak--both meals that I wouldn't say we order on a regular basis when we go out to eat. Once our food came out, we were very impressed as my pasta tasted incredible and his steak was cooked to perfection and seasoned exquisitely. It actually made me happy that we ended up at Grand Lux Cafe rather than a steakhouse, where he would have definitely paid $50.00 for a steak that would have been similar in quality. 

Overall, good service, great food, decent atmosphere, and prices that are better than some of the other more high-end restaurants within the Venetian\/Palazzo means that if you find yourself staying at either of these hotels, I would recommend stopping by Grand Lux Cafe.

The Lemon Chicken Piccata ordered from the lunch menu was very flavorful (cheaper price due to lunch specials from 11am til 5pm); however, while the chicken was tender and excellent, the sauce was heavy and anywhere the sauce wasn't touching the pasta was slightly hard, thus obviously had been sitting under the warming light for a few.  The service, while good, was not up to par for the price we paid.  

However, I feel this restaurant provides a huge number of options that could please everyone.  If you were to go at prime time meal service (instead of 3:30pm), I imagine the food and service would be spot on.",1,0,0

I ordered the chilaquiles because they're always my breakfast go to. I appreciated the plentiful avocados on it, but overall it was a disappointing dish.

I consider myself a somewhat optimistic person, but I am at a complete loss for positive things to say about this place. I went here at brunch\/lunch time to grab a quick bite before heading back to a conference, and I now wish I would've made the walk to McDonalds so I would've had some quality food and service - you heard right, McDs is quality compared to this junk.

My friends both ordered omelettes and I went with a chicken sandwich that involved avocados. The food wouldn't have even been all that bad if they wouldn't have... A) taken 25 minutes to deliver the goods, B) forgotten to tell us that they messed up our order and needed a few extra minutes, C) neglected to explain their mistake, D) placed my food under the warmer so that my bun became burnt and my lettuce an ever-appetizing wilty black, E) neglected to say one more word to us the entire meal - not even thank you.

Sometimes a restaurant delivers crappy food but the service makes up for the mistakes, and sometimes a black hole emerges in the kitchen and maliciously sucks in every hint of good service and humanity of the entire staff. I probably should have expected all of this knowing that the restaurant the bastard child of Cheesecake Factory, but that damned blind optimism got the best of me. Spend the extra cash and go somewhere else, or go to the food court and get a respectable panini, or just don't eat and get a martini instead - any option is a step in the right direction as long as it is a step away from Grand Lux.

First of all, can we give a shout out to all joints that serve their breakfast menu all day? *applause* Already started off with 1 star.

2nd star came when we found out we could order to-go & it would be ready to pick up in 20 minutes, smack dab in the middle of their morning rush. *High-five Lux!*

3rd star came when we picked up our order off to the side of the entrance where the bakery is and they conveniently had other items like baked goods and all different kinds of drinks. I see you, Lux. I see you!

4th star came when I bit into that scrumptious breakfast sammich. That bad boy was huge! I thought I had ordered two of them or something.

There are even signs posted directing you to the door. Once you are there, seating options are inside the restaurant or at one of the tables that is out in the casino. 

My only complaint from the trip was what I imagine to be the only complaint I would ever have with the Grand Lux, the iced tea was not very good. My dissatisfaction goes no further. In fact, from there my satisfaction actually grows rapidly. 

I believe on the menu it is listed as Creamy Spinach and Cheese Dip...though more commonly Spinach and Artichoke dip...and it just might be the best I have ever had. The dip is served with plenty of tortilla chips, so you never have to worry about running out of things to dip, a problem I frequently encounter at other restaurants. 

If you are familiar with the menus at The Cheesecake Factory, then you understand how overwhelmed you can feel at Grand Lux Cafe as well. So many items on the menu and they all sound good. There just aren't enough hours in the day for a menu like that, but you have to start somewhere.

I ordered the Fried Chicken. The meal I anticipated, a breast\/thigh\/leg with a side of mashed potatoes, would have been right for how hungry I was. The meal I got, a veritable mountain of chicken strips with a side of mashed potatoes, was a bit more than I could handle. I think the chicken was like $13-14. You cannot beat that. 

Grand Lux has locations in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Dallas, Houston and Chicago with two future locations of Garden City, NY and Sunrise, FL. At least in the cities where there are currently locations, there are so many restaurants and I always try to not go to the same place twice when I travel since there are so many options.

However my last visit pushed me to write this review. I had ordered a to-go entree salad 20 mins before I knew I would be at the restaurant. When I arrived I went to the bar to pick it up. There were 3 bartenders working, I believe 1 was in training. After I want to say maybe 7 minutes the trainee came over to me I told him I was picking up an order. He then went to the back to pick it up came out maybe 4 minutes later handed me the salad and I proceeded to hand him my debit card. I checked the salad just in case to make sure it was the right one, kale and avocado salad w\/chicken, and it was wrong. Mind you this is 30 minutes after I had placed the order. I let him know it was incorrect, he apologized and went back to the kitchen and brought it back out after another 4 minutes. He said it was the right salad just with not enough kale. I told him no, that I have ordered it many times before and it's an all kale salad with absolutely no romaine in it. He said well that's not what the chef told me. I told him trust me I've had it before so I know what I ordered. He took it to the back and I proceeded to wait another 10 minutes. I've now been in the restaurant 30 minutes for a SALAD after giving them 20 minutes head start. He came out and said the manager would be bringing it out. Finally he brought it out, apologized for the miscommunication and charged me not even full price but more than what I have ever paid for it in the past because they charged me for the wrong salad! I was so shocked that the manager was taking any kind of payment at all that I just gave it to him. So upsetting because I realized when I opened it yet again when I finally sat down to eat it, that it was still not the right salad. Unbelievable

Ordered some food to go at the bakery side: the calamari appetizer and the margharita pizza and a whoopie pie. The calamari also included fried zucchini (I skipped on the onions). Both calamari and margharita pizza were pretty salty--downed my entire liter of bottled water during the meal. The margharita pizza was also pretty thick for a pizza I expected to be more thin crust. Both do not stand well for consumption the next morning. Whoopie pie was okay, though the cream in the middle was very heavy on the frosting.

Portions indeed are huge. I probably would've been fine eating just the calamari appetizer without getting the pizza. Order was ready 20 minutes, so not too long of a wait.

Food: 
Chicken jambalaya: pretty weird, but okay in taste. The chicken was separated from the rice, which isn't traditional of jambalaya. it was more of a stir fry spicy chicken with the rice on the side. 
Ahi tuna tartare- Not the best. Didn't stand out and not particularly appetizing for me, but I'm a raw fish\/sushi snob.

If I wanted to eat at this kind of place I would be hanging out at a Lakewood strip mall, debating Chili's or TGIF's. The menu is huge and they can do that because just like Chili's, or Friday's or any of your other dime a dozen national franchise restaurants nothing is really that fresh except for maybe the salads. All the sauces and seasonings came out of a bottle shipped from their main plant in Kentucky or somewhere else absolutely no wear near the kitchen that prepped your meal.

He suffered the consequences, he wasn't right for a good three days.

If you think I'm just hating on Grand Lux I dare you to just buy a sandwich and take it back to your room and eat it.

It was so savory.. but not overly salty, and a hint of sweet from the bacon. I was in love with this ginormous entree!

I've always heard the Grand Lux described as an upgraded Cheesecake Factory, so I was expecting higher prices. Surprisingly, the sister restaurant chains have comparable, if not identical, pricing schemes.

We walked in here at 11pm on a Tuesday and were greeted and quickly seated. Our server however, was not a happy camper that day. It took her 15 minutes to acknowledge our presence or ask us for our drink order. Since we were starving, this annoyed us a little more that day. Avoiding another delay, we ordered everything at once. Once she had our order, she huffed and puffed away. 

BTW I must mention that this place is similar to the Cheesecake Factory (or so I was told when we checked in to the Venetian). Based on the menu, I can agree a 100%. It was 10 pages long - you have small plates, almost big plates, big plates etc. and the prices seemed to match those at the Cheesecake Factory. It took me 10 minutes to find what I wanted to eat and that also after scanning through only half the menu - maybe that is why the service is so slow - they like to give you time to go through the entire menu :)

Sourdough bread is complimentary, however it was hard and dry and not comparable to nice warm bread. Maybe this is something the restaurant can change. 

For our food, we got the Asian nachos (based on the yelp comments and reviews) and volcano shrimp to start off. The Asian nachos are a MUST TRY. The nachos are freshly baked, crispy, with a sweet sesame topping, chicken, cheese and rice. The chicken is tangy and juicy, and the cheese does not overload the nachos (which is usually what I find on most occasions). The volcano shrimp were fried shrimp (the regular) but the dipping sauce was interestingly tasty - Spicy Chilli Aioli. 

For the entree, I ordered the Indochine Shrimp and Chicken and my wife got the Pasta Pomodoro. Both these plates were good enough for 2 people each (so all in all we got food that could feed 4). I enjoyed my Indochine Shrimp and Chicken, even though it was on the sweeter side with raisins and really lacked the Indian spices it claimed to have. The chicken in this dish was probably a little under-seasoned but the shrimp counterbalanced the chicken in this case. My wife's Pomodoro was plain pasta in tomato sauce and nothing really out of the blue, other than a huge plate of food.

We waited another 15 minutes after finishing to get our check before walking out satiated though not thoroughly happy. The lack of seasoning and flavor in the Chicken (Indochine Shrimp and Chicken) and pasta (Pomodoro), and the poor service makes me give the place a 3 stars.",0,0,0

'Twas an early Saturday evening in Vegas. Dinner time. Four hungry people each craving something different. Where to go? Oh yeah, and good luck getting a table at this time of day, right?

Well, we were in luck. We saw the Grand Lux Café. After checking out the menu we were relieved to see that the menu was so diverse. There really is something for everyone. It seems to cater to the myriad of diverse pallets wandering through the hotel at any given time. There is a link to their ""Full Menu"" on the right side of this page. Guess what?--that ain't their full menu. That is a teaser. The best part was that despite what looked like a large volume of people waiting for a table the hostess ensured us that it would only be a 5 minute wait. (And it was).

They have everything from burgers and steaks to pastas, pizza and seafood as well as a large selections of salads. There's nothing exotic here, mind you, it's all standard North American fare. If you're a food blogger looking to write about your latest culinary conquest you might be a little sad.

I got the Pasta with Grilled Chicken, Tomato, Basil & Mozzarella. It was served in a large dish and as mentioned earlier, portions were generous. Not bad for $16--ish.

A special mention should be made of our friendly and outgoing server. We never did get her name unfortunately. It's always great to receive amazing service that's equal to the delicious food you're getting.

My only gripe is that we were seated next to the area where customers wait for a table to open up. The dining and waiting areas are separated by wrought iron fence. The people waiting have tendency to lean on the fence, sticking their fingers through it and talking loudly amongst themselves with no respect for the people eating on the other side of it. Their was even a child trying to climb the fence at one point. If the staff try and seat you in this area I would suggest that you just wait for a table to open further inside the restaurant.",0,0,0

I wasn't too excited about eating here since I knew the food was probably similar to The Cheesecake Factory, which to me tastes average. Even though we came with no reservations we still got seated promptly - very happy about that since we were all hungry. 

We were in the mood for dinner portion meals so we ordered and shared:

* Spicy Thai Fried Chicken (medium plate): This  was amazing!! Beautiful presentation and the portion just right; chicken was super tender and flavorful too. 

*Kobe Burger: Eh, the beef patty was under seasoned and it took forever to come out. 

*Fish and Chips. Delicious!! Portion was generous - we were given four strips - plus they came out fresh and deliciously crunchy. The fries that it came with were delicious as well. 

The complimentary bread and butter were warm and mm mm tasty.

The food and wait staff remains good as ever, but the management was what let me down.  We were in town over the weekend for our annual basketball tournament and our team of families are very close knit which means dining together and having fun.  I called in advance to make a reservation for a large party of 35 (their website states that they do take them) but I was told that due to the day and time which was a Saturday morning 11:30am and peak time for them (according to the mgr) they could not and would not accept reservations.  We chose to walk-in together, but each family got their own tables.  Keep in mind all thirty five of us walked in together giving our names and party number one right after another.  They seated us sporadically so we were far apart from each other, not fun.  What I was upset about was clearly seeing two areas that were completely empty and could have easily accommodated us.  If a restaurant has a 550 seat capacity, how difficult would it be to put 35 people together especially when there is clearly room available?  Due to this, I have decided that we will dine at other establishments as a team (see my Nora's Italian Cuisine review) when we return for our yearly tournaments.

By 1pm the pain finally stopped. I slept it off but it ruined my vacation. All week my throat was burning in pain from the acid. I've vomited before in my life but never like this; it was horrifying. 

I called the restaurant where they tried to blame it on something else and used the phrase ""Well you didn't consult a doctor so how could you be certain it was caused by us"" oddly they said this before asking if I was okay! I hadn't eaten since 9pm the day before; it was the Lux. Someone in corporate relations left me a voice mail and I will update this review after I talk to them on the condition they do something.

First of all, the restaurant is located right on the casino floor of the Venetian.  We sat right in the front balcony area which can be exciting but not recommended if you're sensitive to cigarette smoke.  After a while, all the smoke made our eyes water so I would advise a table in the interior of the restaurant if you're smoke-adverse.

I ordered the Sunday Night Pasta on a Sunday night.  The portion was generous, always a plus.  The meat sauce had beef short rib, steak, mushrooms, and other seasonings.  My test for pasta is, I can usually polish off an entire entree if it is really, really good.  With this pasta I found the meat sauce to be on the heavy side.  The spaghettini was all right but on a whole, the entree did not wow me as it did in some of the other reviews.  I ate about half my plate.  My wife got the Zen noodle soup.  I tasted it.

We had chicken and waffles which was something different to try, but tasty,  steak sandwich - very good, fried calamari with rock shrimp - an excellent dish, salad & soup combo which was nothing special, we didnt  even finish half of it. However, each portion was way bigger than I thought. For the drink, my bf had beer, while I got orange & strawberry smoothie in a big glass was super good that I kept drinking instead of eating food, but still couldnt finish, therefore I had to ask my bf to suck it up 'cause I didnt want to waste it.

Kristopher had the red velvet pancakes and side of ham. We should have went with the breakfast buffet since Kris's pancakes were so sweet, he said they tasted like cake.

We went in for breakfast one morning after checking out.  The breakfast buffet is kept hidden in a room off the dining areas, so you don't get to see it as you're waiting or being seated.  We sat down and saw the buffet on the menu at $18.95 a person.  Not seeing anything on the menu that immediately got my attention I opted to go with that.  I mean it's Vegas, and the Buffets are amazing right?  Not this one.  Very basic options, hash browns, sausage, bacon, oatmeal.  Some pastries, breads for toasting and a fruit bar. There was also an omelette bar.  Two guys fixing omelettes (basic ham, sausage, cheese, mushrooms, onions and spinach fixings) or over easy eggs.  That's it.  That's your Breakfast Buffet.  Embassy Suites has a better breakfast buffet and they don't charge you $18.95.

Our server was great, we didn't have to wait long for a table even though the line was very long and I can't say much about the rest of the food on the menu, but if you're looking for an amazing, Las Vegas style breakfast buffet, look elsewhere.  This place doesn't have it.",0,1,0

Service was very attentive from the start, they had waters and menus in our hands within a few minutes. After ordering, they brought our warm fresh bread and butter which I decided to stuff myself with. 

I ordered the Pasta with Chicken, Sun-Dried Tomato and Mushrooms. Portion size was humongous, could have easily been two meals for me. Reminded me a lot of Cheesecake Factory, which I learned later that they are under the same ownership. I'm not a huge fan of pasta, but when done correctly, it's like I'm having a party in my mouth. The pasta to sauce ratio was perfect, chicken was cooked very nicely and the hot chili flakes added that much-needed kick to the dish. Definitely one of the best pastas I've had. Had I not stuffed myself in the beginning with bread, I probably would have been able to finish it, but I ended up taking half to-go. 

For Vegas, this was very reasonably priced and once again, the service was on point especially with the number of large parties in attendance that night.

I had originally walked over the Palazzo location Friday night for dinner at 8pm but was turned away due to a kitchen problem?  Anyway, it was a short and quick walk over to this location.

I was quickly seated on a Friday night and it took my server a bit of time to get to me.  Its okay because I had bread and water and the extensive menu to look over since there is tons of choices!  My server did not mention the specials to me...I overheard the other server next to me tell his tables the soups and specials for the evening.  I usually never order specials but it would of been nice to hear her mention it to me as well.

Anyway I decided on the Sunday night pasta entree ($18) and a side broccolini ($5) for my little one!  It was a good choice!  I loved the taste and the soft stewed meat in the pasta dish. It was different but very tasty!  Loved the side order of broccolini as it wasn't drenched in butter or oil like some other places, just steamed like how I like it!

Flagging down my server for the bill and a box took a bit longer than usual, I was in a rush though, I had a flight to catch in a few hours, so maybe she didn't want to rush my Friday night dinner.  So no biggie, she didn't know.

Located within the Venetian Hotel and Casino, Grand Lux Cafe is good all types of food cravings whether it being breakfast, lunch, brunch, dinner or dessert. Came here for lunch during my recent stay here and had the Cajun Shrimp Jambalya which tasted awesome...good flavor, good portion, very filling. Best lunch I had my entire 5 days in Vegas. Added to that I had for dessert the Godiva Chocolate Cheese Cake. I'm already a chocolate fanatic as it is, especially when it comes to cakes....this simply was a-freakin-mazing! Rich chocolate and whipped cream topping....smh...I think I could had eaten that for a week straight and would he alright with that, it was that damn good. 

Grand Lux...you did your thing with BOTH food and service. The ONLY thing I would say a negative as far as Grand Lux...too much dim lighting. I damn near had to use the flashlight on my phone to read the menu and I have great vision.

There was no wait and hardly anyone in the restaurant but service was sooo slow and our waitress seemed to be in la la land. We asked for water 3 times before she finally decided to bring it and then she just left us there for a good 15 minutes even though we told her we were ready to order when she brought the water. 

We finally order and the food takes forever to arrive. By this time, we've gone through 2 bread baskets and our water but she doesn't come back to fill the water, just brings another one and doesn't answer our question about where the food is. 

When the food finally arrived it was just ok. My friend got the waffles and I got the southwest enchiladas. It all looked good but the portions were huge and the food lacked flavor. We got through about half of it before deciding we were done and once we decided on that, the check took forever to arrive. *sigh*",1,2,2

Since we were staying at the Venetian, we decided to just keep it simple and eat close by. Luckily, there was not a long wait for a party of 6.

Let me just put it out now. RUDE SERVICE!
I don't care if it's Vegas or not vegas, if you're a server, you should have a good attitude no matter what restaurant or location you're at. Our server, I shall leave his name out of this review, was rude the moment he came to our table and asked for drinks. We had already been drinking all day at the pool and all we wanted were waters. He gave us this look of disgust and made a comment along the lines of just waters?... And just kind of walked away to let us look over the menus. It would have been nice too to introduce yourself too, sir.

Finally when he came back to take our orders, I asked him if they put the ranch on the side or on the Buffalo Wings appetizer dish and he looked at me as if I were asking a stupid question. His reply was ""So you want it on the side...? Or just extra on the side...?"" I then had to explain to him to leave the ranch on the side because I was allergic to dairy and eggs. He then straight up said ""Well then you can't have them!! It has all of those in it"" in a tone of voice assuming I'm supposed to know this?! Forget it then. We ended up ordering the Chicken Lettuce Wraps for an appetizer and when it came to entrees, I ordered the Clams with Pasta dish. I asked him what kind of noodles they used and he said, ""Egg noodles. You can't have that either!"" I asked if they could substitute the noodles for non-egg noodles and he started listing off random noodles I barely recognized by name. I guess I had a confused look on my face because he just sighed and asked if I just wanted rice noodles instead. Done. Oh, and by the way, throughout this whole conversation over food allergies, this guy has the nerve to laugh and joke about it....

Food comes out, he doesn't even come back to check on us until after we're almost done and it's only to ask if we wanted boxes. Honestly, this place is open 24\/7 and I know for sure I would come back here after a night of drinking, but if all the servers here had this guys attitude, I would rather go to Denny's. Looking at the other reviews, it seemed like our table just got bad luck and got this horrible server. Overall, the food is pretty good with big portions. I would probably compare this place to a Cheesecake Factory with a Maggiano's ambiance.",3,1,2

There's always great service and great food here.  It always takes me a long time to decide what to order because there's so many delicious choices!  I've been here multiple times with large groups and smaller groups and its very convenient for both.

I want to write an ode to the salted caramel syrup my cousin had with her chicken and waffles.  I mean, like in Gaelic. Hardcore.  We took some to go, and drank it for ""breakfast"" the next day.

I had the Zen Noodles and all I can tell you is, it's some of the best ""pho"" I've had in awhile!   The lemongrass broth beats plain ol chicken or beef or veggie any day!  You can add the veggies (sprouts, basil, lime) and request the Sriracha (although it was in paste form, and I prefer the chili pepper sauce).  The noodles are big and flat, and I like how they bring you extra broth in a small carafe - aye! que cute!

My bestie had the chicken parm, and I'm telling you, the portions DON'T PLAY.  If we had been in the same moods, and not so tipsy, I would have shared.  As it were, we had parm the next day for lunch - BOTH of us.

Even though it's a large establishment inside a casino, the waiters don't treat you like you're a tourist at Disneyland.

There are, in fact, multiple Grand Lux cafes, with identical menus -- one  inside the Venetian and one at the Palazzo (the two casinos are seamlessly connected). And there's also a mini G.L. serving coffee and pastry.

This is a great option when you're looking for reliably good food served quickly -- but not in the mood for a) the food court, or b) a high-dollar, celebrity-chef inspired, fine-dining ""experience"". I ate at Grand Lux twice this weekend (once at V and once at the Palazzo), and the service was exceptional. For breakfast I had the best French toast I've tasted in a long time -- not too soft, gooey, or sweet (made with Brioche). (I rarely go out for breakfast, but for this place I'll make an exception; so many places seem compromised at breakfast, like everything is being done by the B team, which I suspect it probably is.) At lunch, I had the chicken enchiladas (available in two portion sizes -- the lunch consists of two smallish enchiladas, plenty of food unless you are really hungry). The sauces were spicy and flavorful -- a nice dish and only about $11. Hubby had the appetizer-portion Greek salad, also good, and quite substantial. We had a side of fries, and they were good. 

The staff made sure our water glasses were filled, not making us feel rushed, and the time we spent there was exactly right (they keep the music up *really* loud to keep those tables turned... but in a nice way).

For breakfast they have a buffet option for $16.99 or you can order from the menu.  For kids the buffet was $9.50 and since one of mine is only 2 years old she was free.  So two kids buffets for $9.50 total is a deal that can't be beat.  I had the chicken and waffles which is a heart attack waiting to happen but was very good nonetheless.

Ryan and I were having a Mini Vacation out in Vegas December 14-17th; My friends always come to Vegas (my best friend is Dating someone from out there) and I had only been to Vegas once in my entire life for a little less than a day. 

I decided that since I've stepped into this town without the faintest idea of what I'm doing, I'll holler at my friends who are no strangers. They suggested Grand Lux; I had never heard of this place before even though its a chain and I didn't even know it was part of the Cheesecake Factory family until I Yelped it (Like the good yelper I am, I referred to my iPhone app to spy on this place before diving in)* and was relieved to find that it got pretty good reviews. 

We ate here twice. First time was yum nummy.

Lunch: 
--Buffalo chicken rolls HOLY COW good; 
--Ryan's Enchilada lunch special was very good
--My chicken salad\/house salad\/chicken and mushroom soup was.. a little bland, it was okaaay, but It needed SOMETHING. Finished my salad the vinaigrette was good. 

They have some pretty good lunch deals which are HUGE servings even for lunch. The Buffalo chicken rolls were soo good, I crave them all the time. 

Dinner (the next day) 
--Ryan got Crispy Caramel Chicken with Rice which was pretty good although we were a bit apprehensive about the caramel part. 

++Now here's where they lose points++
--I got the flat bread spicy chicken sandwich which was HORRIBLE! Bland Bland; Flat bread was tough and tasted like cardboard, chicken was bland and tasted like Subway ""roasted chicken"" the spicy mayo was gross and the fries were way too crunchy & COLD. I was so disappointed. 

--Good thing I was able to get a little full from the Buffalo Rolls we ordered again. 


It seemed like I got the short straw here.. My food was never that great, but Ryan's was waaay better. Almost like a different place. Put I do give it points for having some good things on the menu, but I have to take some away for being kind of inconsistent. 


So I struggle with the stars here. I wouldn't kick GLC out of bed though. I'll come back here again because for two 21 year old struggling college students, the prices weren't bad at all. I'll come back. But I just wish the place was consistent.

I tried this restaurant for the first time because I stayed at the Venetian. This place is like another Cheesecake Factory because it has a different variety of foods.

First off, the portions are HUGE. We were warned by the server, but I didn't think it'd be that big. We ordered 3 pastas and 2 appetizers for five people. We only finished one appetizer...

For starters, we had the calamari and Thai crispy rolls. The breading didn't stick to the calamari, which just made it okay. I thought the Thai crispy rolls were just alright also, but my friends really liked it. The crispy rolls were the only thing we finished.

We all agreed that the best item we ordered was the Garlic Shrimp pasta. I like this dish because it wasn't too heavy for pasta. The pasta with Grilled Chicken, Sun Dried-Tomatoes, and Mushrooms was pretty good also. I didn't really enjoy the Pasta Carbonara because I don't like bacon and it kind of overpowered the dish.

The service was really good. It was the best service we had in Vegas. Our server was really friendly and attentive. I wish I had her name so I could give her some recognition.

I wanted to give this place four stars, but it's just not a four star restaurant to me. I don't know how to explain it... I would probably come back to this place because it's affordable to eat in Vegas. It's also open 24 hours so I'd pick this place to eat when I'm drunk too.",0,0,1

factory's little brother.. Located inside the palazzo.  I'm not making that up, it really is from  the creators of cheesecake factory.  In fact, I ended up liking this place better than CF. times ten.

Has a wide range of entrees to choose from but not as much as big  
bro.  They have some things that are similar, like some of the main  
dishes, salads and desserts. But what cheesecake factory DOES NOT have are CHEESESTEAK ROLLS.  What it is.. Philly cheesesteak with cheese and mushrooms rolled in to a little, yummy appetizer. Crispy outside.. And warm philly cheesesteak inside.. but bitesized. (kinda like an egg roll..but not.. it's better.)   I had to rave about it because I liked it so much.
They also have comp bread n butta which was pretty good.  not the same bread as cf's.. equally as good as my favorite molasses bread.

I ordered the chicken with sun dried tomatoes & mozzarella pasta and added  grilled shrimp to it.  It was screwdriver shaped pasta with creamy sauce, full of flavor.  I liked it!  Really really big dish, I ate alot and still had plenty of leftovers.

people in my party ordered salmon dishes.. one miso salmon dish (which tasted good, better than CF's) and one called ""salmon 3 ways""  (which had 3 different flavors of salmon).. another ordered the combo of ribeye and shrimp scampi w. mashed potatoes.

The Grand Lux Cafe is in the same family of restaurants as the Cheesecake Factory so you can expect the same kind of menu with the same large portion sizes. Even though there is one in town back in LA and this one has been here in the hotel for years and years, this is my first visit to a Grand Lux; heck, even my daughter has been to this place with her friends before we've been here, so on this occasion since the four of us were all together as a family, she acted as our unofficial guide... 

The Lux has a very casual cafe style and feel to it. Even though it was located in a posh hotel environment, you could tell that people came to this place in waves: basically before and after each showing nearby, and anytime there is a group or convention in the hotel. What I really didn't like about this particular restaurant was that the marble tile floors were so slippery. I remembered that I almost skid and ate shit once I got up from my seat, the floor had a thin veneer of grease or butter where I had stepped. I tried to warn our waitress who was standing close by to be careful about the slippery floor, but all she could muster up was that the floors were always slick and that she wore shoes with special soles. Great, what about us poor unsuspecting souls?.... 

Everybody here (on Yelp) seems to like the Chicken and Waffles so that's what I ordered. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/NvKNe9DnQavC9GstglcBJQ?select=cfloeeSOVB7A2MUCpDsTdA Nice thick 8"" round Belgian waffle with deep nooks to hold the toppings and maple syrup and dusted with confectioners sugar, finally topped unceremoniously with fried chicken strips. Nothing wrong with the chicken strips as they were skinless chick boobs fried crisp in their stretched and mangled shapes, they were not greasy but a little dry because of the white meat. I still don't really get the whole chicken and waffles Southern style because I usually eat either one separately. All I can say is that I could only finish 3\/4 of this incredibly heavy plate of carbs... 

As a matter of fact, I was so disinterested in my meal at this glorified diner, that I didn't take much notice in what the rest of the family ordered. A Chicken Madeira plate,http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/NvKNe9DnQavC9GstglcBJQ?select=fjfX7LmaHR1KwWj2UGc09A a Short Rib Cheddar Cheese Burger,http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/NvKNe9DnQavC9GstglcBJQ?select=pa-WSyb4F6YJTe3J4O4__A and a Manhattan Salad w\/turkey, avocado, and beets...

I've never been disappointed by the food that comes out of the kitchen, the service, or the view (last time here, saw Lebron James, Donyell Marshall and their posse). This appears to be one of the favorites of my close buddy and his family as well.

The Venetian hotel is known for it's 5 star service and decor, that of classic elegance. The name itself evokes thoughts of royalty and class. The restaurant almost always has a line, especially at night as this is one of the few restaurants open late night with a full palatable menu.

Environment: the restaurant had the main dining hall, a couple side sections and the ""outdoor"" patio. All are very open with high ceilings so that you never feel crowded. Given that this is in the middle of one of the more popular hotels in Vegas, ambient noise is a given. We happened to sit on the patio which is still inside the hotel but enclosed by a 3 foot high antique gate. Perfect for people-watching especially because you have a great view of the hallway leading to Tao nightclub. The tables are a little too closely situated together (I coupe clearly hear the conversation of our neighbors) but you're never hitting elbows. If you're a larger person, request the booth seating because the chairs are designed for people with a BMI of 25 or less.

Waiter\/waitresses: she made several trips to our table to make sure we were enjoying our dinner. Every time she came by, she had a smile on her face. Our water cups never went empty nor did our bread basket. Overall, impressive service and something you'd expect at a more intimate 4-star restaurant.

Food: I just learned that this restaurant is owned by Cheesecake Factory. That explains the decor, bread, an much of the menu. The bread basket contains freshly baked honey wheat and sourdough. The crust is crunchy and flaky while the middle of the loaf is soft and chewy, the perfect consistency for bread. The honey aspect of the wheat bread is not overpowering but adds jut a hint of sweetness to enhance your appetite and clear your palate for the entree. For the main course I had the crispy caramel chicken. Basically, it's fancy orange chicken which is served with a medley of vegetables marinated in the sweet and spicy thai sauce covering the chicken as well ad a generous helping of either brown or white rice. The chicken's crust was a little thick, making it difficult to chew. The chicken itself was on the drier side and the sauce a little too sweet. In fact, the dish was more sweet than spicy. If that suits your taste, you may want to check this dish out.

Drinks: just water.

Both came with fries and coupled with their yummy complimentary bread, the food was more than enough to fill us up.

I really enjoyed my steak sandwich.  The meat was very juicy and tender, while the arugula and tomatoes gave the sandwich a refreshing quality.

I agree with the similarities to the Cheesecake Factory when it comes to how the courses are delivered, but food quality blows CF out of the water.

Aside from the calamari, we had the Rustic Lasagna, Chicken Royale and Shaking Beef - all delicious. 

One thing to keep in mind is that the portions are huge. For those (like us) that don't have the appetite to match, it's appropriate here to split the entree and maybe have a couple appetizers.

after checking out the menu, we couldn't help the similarity with cheesecake factory (which i think there is some correlation or relationship at least).

anyways we opted for the calamari salad and the sloppy joe.

once the meals came and we dug in, we were instantly hooked. we terrorized each plate to the bone. the calamari salad was realllllllly good. very flavorful and the fried calamari really went well with it all. the sloppy joe very flavorful and complimented by the criss cut fries very well

our waiter suggested we try the beignets and swore that they were the shit. we ordered some and were kinda disappointed. they tasted like bland donuts imo. but whatever that calamari salad was so good.

I've been to the Grand Lux Cafe in Chicago along time ago, but I remembered that I absolutely loved it.  I have also never had a bad experience at the Cheesecake Factory.  I went to the Grand Lux twice during my stay at the Venetian.  The first time was for the breakfast where I got the breakfast buffet option.  The orange juice was really good and it tasted like it was freshly squeezed.  The fruit offered at the buffet line also tasted fresh and there were a decent selection.  The other buffet offering were pretty standard.  They offered hash browns, scrambled eggs, sausage, and bacon that was way too oily.  There was also an omelet station, but I did not get to have one made because the line was too long and I was hungry!  They also had an assortment of pastries, but I would have rather seen pancakes and waffles instead.  I was also disappointed to see that they did not have cottage cheese, which I thought was a breakfast buffet staple.  Everything cost $20 including tax and tip, but for that amount of money I would like to see more buffet options.

The second time I went was for late night dining.  I started with the broccoli cheddar soup which was RUNNY and BLAND and did not come with crackers or bread until I requested it.  I got the chicken and waffles as my main dish.  The waffle itself was pretty good.  It had good crunchy texture and buttery taste.  The chicken was also decent, but I should point out that these were chicken tenders and not fried chicken with the bone.  It was served with a pecan maple syrup.  I've never had authentic chicken and waffles, but I have a feeling that the original would have been a lot better than GLC""s upscale version.",0,0,0

After hearing rave reviews of this place, I knew it was worth trying.  After eating there would I head back?  Since there are so many other restaurants to chose from in The Venetian, probably not.

Got there at 6:00pm on a Friday night and were sat immediately.  There were three of us.  They brought out bread and butter right away, but really lacked as it took more than 15 minutes to come back and ask for our drink orders.

The menu selection is MASSIVE with all types of food.

We ordered:
*Edamame: Soybeans in Their Pods Stir Fried with Spicy Szechuan Sauce
-I've never had Edamame this way before and it was probably my favorite thing of the night, besides the sourdough bread.

*Asian Chicken Salad: Sliced Chicken Breast, Crisp Wontons, Rice Noodles, Lettuce, Napa Cabbage, Green Onion and Roasted Almonds. Tossed in Our Asian Dressing
-Completely flavorless.  The end.

*Seafood Salad: Lump Crab, Shrimp, Avocado, Tomato, Corn, Green Beans, Egg, Celery and Green Onion Over a Bed of Crisp Romaine Tossed with Our ""Louis"" Dressing
-I didn't try this one, but the person said it was really good.  Very generous with the seafood!

For Dessert:
*Butterscotch Caramel Pudding: Rich, Creamy Butterscotch Pudding Topped with Whipped Cream, House-Made Caramel Nut Popcorn and a Chocolate Chip Pecan Cookie
-To me, the pudding was thick like custard.  It was delicious!

*Key Lime Pie: Baked Fresh with a Graham-Pecan Crust. Topped with Fresh Whipped Cream
-Delicious!

*White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake®
-Same cheesecake that is served at The Cheesecake Factory.  I mean, can you really go wrong?  Nope!

I will say that it was really nice to sit and chat with friends without being rushed.  We got there at 6:00pm and left at 9:00pm.  Now the service was very slow, but at the same time, if we weren't chatting and eating slow, we probably would have gotten out of there at 7:00pm.

The people working there could be just a bit slower and they would work backwards. Seriously.
Once they finally get your food out, its the WRONG order, NOT what you ordered at all.

I personally don't care for Cheesecake Factory so this was a pleasant surprise that their menu vastly differs from their counterpart.  Their menu was pages and pages in length.  I wanted to order so many items!

Staying at the Palazzo in December had led us (6 girls) not want to venture out much in the cold and just dine in primarily The Palazzo or the Venetian.  It so happened that we ended up here for both breakfast\/lunch and dinner this past trip.  For breakfast\/lunch they offer lunch specials for a reasonable price and from the looks of what my friends ordered, the portions seem filling to the point of having leftovers.  After a night of drinking, I always crave soup.  My friend mentioned pho earlier and we read the zen noodles description which sounded like pho so I thought to give it a try.  It tasted similar to pho, but lacking flavor.  It did come with chili, basil, and bean sprouts.  It did the job and hit te spot- and was enjoyable.  For dinner, I had an ahi appetizer which was fantastic.  It tasted very fresh and was accompanied by 3 types of salad: carrot, cucumber, and bean sprouts.  The cucumber and bean sprout salads were delish but the carrot salad really didn't have much flavor.  I could say that I enjoyed both my meals and that I wouldn't mind coming back.

On the other hand, some of my friends cared to disagree.  For lunch, my friend wanted a pickle to add to her sandwich but they said they didn't have pickles.  Not a big thing to me, but this displeased my friend.  For dinner when we came back, they had 2 soups of the day: cream of chicken and clam chowder.  3 of my friends ordered the clam chowder and maybe 20 minutes into waiting, the manager had to come up to our table to apologize and say they ran out of clam chowder.  What a disappointment to hear that the chowder was the special but they didn't have any left because they ran out of clams.  On both lunch and dinner meals, service was lacking.  It took at least 20-30 minutes+ wait for food.  Water was scarce and so was the waiter.

No, it really was amazing.  Since I stayed at the Palazzo, I was reasonably close, and came here to eat for a meal for like 3 days in a row, and it was always delicious!  Meals also come with complimentary bread and butter..the bread was always warm, and very soft in the center. Yum.

A few things that I tried...and loved

Shrimp Scampi Pasta $20

This came with HUGE pieces of shrimp and the pasta was extremely tasty..the cream in the pasta was not too overwhelming and they put in just the right amount so that the pasta was not swimming in pasta sauce.  The serving for this dish was huge..we split it among 3 girls and it was perfect.

Garlic Shrimp Pasta $19

Also delicious, but similar to the shrimp scampi pasta...size of shrimp was considerably smaller..also came with fresh heirloom tomatoes, and some asparagus.  Over all, a very delicious meal. 

Chicken and Avocado Salad lunch portion $12

Vegetables were super fresh, the dressing that came on the side was very tasty, and serving for extremely large.  A healthy meal to counter all the alcohol that was consumed the night before.

We were seated at a table for 2 that one side is a long bench and the other side chairs.  So there were people next to us, but enough room for me to get in\/out.  Even though we were close to the people next to us we didn't find it hard to hear each other and we couldn't hear anyones conversations except the ladies right next to us. That is such a plus in my mind.

The menu has lots of choices - pasta, salads, sandwiches, chicken dishes, steaks, etc.  this is a perfect place in vegas when you're with several people and not everyone wants just sushi or italian.  

They bring out nice warm bread (and butter) after seating you.

My husband and I both opted for hamburgers. He got the Max burger (with short ribs on the burger, hello!) and I got the bacon cheese burger. They easily substituted cheddar for me instead of american.  Burgers were about $12-13 each and came with fries or organic green salad.

This was the largest regular size restaurant burger I've ever had and also the best I've had. It truly looked as if when I ordered it, the guy in the kitchen pulled out some ground beef and made my patty by hand.  I couldn't even quite finish 1\/2 of it.  And I can eat an entire red robin burger.  Seriously, it was just delicious. 

Service was wonderful. The waitress seemed to notice every time we needed a refill on drinks and was quick to check on how things were going and bring extra condiments we wanted.  

This is a must eat place for me on any future trips to Vegas.  Next time though, we'll be splitting the burger, haha!",1,0,1

I had lunch here with some girlfriends before my bachelorettte party festivities started.  I love that our server was so responsive and friendly.  I also LOVED that there are so many different options on the menu from cheap to really expensive.  I always think it's really important to have a variety of prices with such a large group.

Pros:
-Great food
-Open 24 Hours
-Wide array of pricing
-Yummy cocktails
-REALLY nice servers

Cons:
-Wait can be long late night (depending on when everyone leaves clubs)",0,0,0

Solid food, friendly waitstaff, enormous menu and it's open 24 hours. Definitely a great place for brunch, lunch, or at 4am when you're back from the clubs. This place only lost a couple brownie points because I ordered a Strawberry Bellini (which was on the menu) and they were out of them. I asked, ""Are you out of the strawberries or the champagne?"" and the waitress said they were out of the champagne! How could a restaurant in vegas not have champagne. So I was denied my brunch cocktail!

 If you're staying  at the hotel or even just passing through, you can count on this place to fill your belly before you head out to the casinos.",0,0,0

I wasn't really craving the sandwich so I didn't eat it, but the soup was ok and the salad was really good. It was just green leaves with ranch, but for some reason, it tasted really good to me. My family got a spinach dip, and pasta and they seemed to really enjoy both. I didn't try them, but they finished it all, so it must've been delicious.",0,0,0

We could see there were some seats open and were happy to not have to wait. What we didn't know was just how big this restaurant is. We thought it was just the small seating area you could see from the shopping area. The hostess brought us behind that all to a much larger dining room with nice decorations. It was somewhat dimly lit which we enjoyed. The menu is one of the most extensive we have seen. We decided to get a bbq chicken pizza and the beef wellington medallions. Both were fantastic. The sauce with the medallions was amazing. It included mushrooms, which I don't really like, yet I wouldn't have even known they were there. It was a delight to get a good Las Vegas dinner for under $20 a plate. I would recommend it more for adults but there were plenty of families there.",0,0,0

I had tasteless OJ, a weak latte and their breakfast sandwich. This was a greasy chewy brioche sandwich of scrambled eggs ham and tomato served with a cold side of bland, greasy hash brown shredded potatoes. 
 
Had better food at most greasy spoons for less than half the price.",0,0,0

They don't take reservations so try to come here early especially if you have a big party. The atmosphere was really nice especially with the lights sort of dimmed. Anyways, I got some type of pasta and so did some of my other girlfriends. Tell me why the portions was hugeee! I ordered a drink here and when we got the check, it was freakin $12. No wonder they don't put the prices for the drinks on their menus haha. 

Overall, it's a Cheesecake Factory that's open for 24 hours.",1,1,1

Food took forever though so they lose one star for that.  Food was not very memorable either so they lose another star for that.  It was just okay.  A few of the ladies in our party complained about their food as well and that it is waaaaayyyyy over priced.  Well that's Sin City for ya.,1,0,0
