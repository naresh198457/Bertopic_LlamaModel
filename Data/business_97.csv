Dress code is standard club--look cute! #DUH

Hiphop room downstairs is WAY too small. WTF! lol

The only thing that I don't like is that if you don't have a table, there is no where to sit or ""take a break"" from dancing. Also the upstairs portion you can't even really look below to the main dance floor because the design has booths ALL the way around it. The stairs really throw me off too...I can see this as being disastrous for people who can't hang with partying. I was offered a table for $1K incl 2 bottles but passed because I really just wanted to check it out and hang for a bit before venturing to another spot.

Other than that, typical\/standard new club with a great sound system, lighting, and lots of people.",2,0,0

Ok so the place is HUGE... but so many damn stairs sheesh! LOL

Got on the guest list free entry for 8 guys - that's rare so very cool! Lil Jon was the guest DJ, dude is like 5'5 maybe 5'3 that was a surprise, cool that he passed out champagne to the people on the dance floor.

Nice club, drinks are pricey - but yeah that's a given...

Dance floor is pretty big + several  areas w\/ different music to match your vibe. 

I don't think you really need bottle service here. I mean there really isn't any place to sit without a table but you'll do fine without a table as far as having a great time and ""meeting"" people ;)

So many people just spit ya game playa! Definitely one of the top 2 clubs in Vegas right now - maybe the top club?

I woke up the next morning, remembering what I did, and decided ""Well, I guess I'm going to Vegas!"". I told my best friend who is also a Calvin Harris fan and he bought a ticket, too. Less than two weeks from our trip, my solo vacation jumped to myself and four of my guy friends. So here we go.

We pregamed at a couple spots around The Strip, because we knew Hakkasan would be pricey. We knew this and we were still in. We rolled up to HK around 10:15pm and noticed that the line(s) for the Calvin Harris show was already starting to form and they were pretty long, so we decided to start queuing up as well. Once the doors opened, we were swept in and into an elevator up to the fourth floor where the club is.

We all got in and Burns was still setting up, so we posted up towards the front of the DJ booth and socialized and danced. We were two rows away from Burns. Fucking epic. Calvin Harris showed up around 1am and the crowd swarmed down to the dance floor. Calvin Harris started his set and I was in heaven. The crowd, minus a few people (smoking on the dance floor is kinda no bueno, and I'm a smoker...and trying to push your drunk girlfriend to the front, while you are also wasted...no bueno also), was on it's best behavior. The lights...the sound system...everything at Hakkasan that night was all that we wanted and more.

Around 4am or so, we headed over to the bar (after being firmly planted for almost six hours) to get drinks. I ordered a Grey Goose and Soda, priced at $22. I knew this was gonna be the most expensive drink of my trip, so I swallowed it up. All four of us California dudes had a great time that night. Staff was friendly, nothing got stolen from us, the crowd didn't affect us...everything was all good. So good that I booked my ticket to go see Tiesto for New Years back here at Hakkasan.

With that being said...

First, what are these horrendous stairs people keep referring to? Reading these reviews from y'all make me hate stairs! Did we catch the elevator on the one time it has ever worked? Did we hallucinate said elevator? No we didn't. It was Hakkasan Blue. Sounds like we just got lucky.

**EDIT** Apparently, we had to go up a bunch of stairs to get into Hakkasan after the elevator. I don't remember going up...or down...any massive staircases. I still think y'all are imagining stairs.

Complaining about expensive drinks in Vegas nightclubs is like complaining the water is too hot in a hot tub. Honey, you knew this club was gonna be pricey, so you shouldn't have acted surprised when you and your girls had to dish out $80 for four Long Islands. Y'all can't have EVERYTHING for free...

Who the hell hit someone with a bottle here? Who the hell is THROWING BOTTLES...and what did this person do to get a bottle thrown AT THEM...I'd love to hear THAT story. Girl...some people just can't have nice things.

Anywho, I came to Hakkasan, I saw it, I stayed out till 5am (haven't done that in forever), and I LOVED it and will be back.",7,6,4

The first night was on a Thursday to see Chainsmokers. Got in free with a promoter and got a free table. This is definitely the way to go! They wouldn't let us in until we had over 5 people and a bunch of people were running late. Line to get in was ridiculous. Took a good half hour. Super unorganized! My friend ended up losing her phone the first night. She called right after she realized she lost it and it had already been turned off. Checked with lost and found and it was never recovered. Greased the valet lady with $10 and she let us valet our car since it was for hotel guests only that night. Also a huge free parking lot available as well! 

Second night with Steve Aoki was ridiculous. Make sure to get the presale tickets online to avoid paying $50 at the door! My wallet ended up getting stolen even though my cross body bag never left my side! Luckily MGM had it the next day. Missing all the cash of course. Even took the coins wtf. Steve Aoki put on an amazing show! I'm not even a huge fan but knowing he does this every week it was crazy how genuinely happy and excited he seemed to be there. Flavor Flav was there as well! My friends ended up getting frosting all over their suede shoes and another friend got stepped on and they literally BROKE his shoe wtf! I didn't even know that was possible! Don't wear your nice shoes here! Lots of ladies in heels who all ended up barefoot halfway through the night. 

This place is freaking huge. I feel like I ended up alone 80% of both nights I was here. Once you lose someone its so hard to find them again! I'm amazed I was ever able to find any of my friends again. $20 shots, $8 water (they're not allowed to give free water) and $10 beers. The shots are a better deal since they use premium liquor (Belvedere and Patron) vs the $10 Budwisers. Easy to get a table if you're a girl. People were offering my friends and I drinks at their table all night. I definitely drank out of the sink a couple times with my hands the first night. Whatevs. I have chronic thirst. 

Protips: People are constantly abandoning their tables with 20 bottles of Fiji water just sitting there when they leave. Get to it before the staff takes it back! Also watch your shit. I was lucky enough to get my wallet back but you know there are people who just straight up snatch your purses and bounce. Try not to lose your friends. I didn't care either way but I was amazed every time I was actually able to find one again. I remember being in the Asian themed room and I was so confused I thought I had drunkenly wandered into another club but it was just another area in Hakkasan.",2,4,1

I still had a great time but it's not really unique. Just like Marquee and Omnia, there's a main dance floor that plays edm and a smaller hip hop room called Ling Ling's. The size of both the main floor and hip hop room are probably the exact same size as Marquee. Just like all the other clubs, drinks are expensive as hell. I feel like if you go to Omnia, you don't really need to go to Hakkasan.

For guys and gals, get pre-sale tickets beforehand. Tickets at the door have been rumored to cost up to $100. As a guy, I only paid $45 online. Plus you don't have to wait in an obnoxiously long line. Sure you can be put on the guest list but by 9:30pm, the guest list line was already snaking around the outside so you'll be standing outside for a hot minute waiting to get into a club that opens at 11pm.

Overall, it's a fun club, don't get me wrong. I just feel like you've not really missing out on much if you go to either Omnia or Marquee instead.",1,0,0

I came here with my girls the night after they opened (April 19) and we were super excited to check out the new club everyone has been hyping up.  

My first impression upon entry was that it reminded me of Marquee's layout -- the stairs, stage\/dance floor layout, and tables.  Unlike Marquee, there seemed to be more tables located near the back of the club, as well as some standing room.  But I do not recall there being an outside patio.  

I feel like your experience here (as well as at any club in Vegas) depends on the DJ, who you're with, if you have a table, and if you're on a good level.  Hardwell was performing the night we went (YES!), I was with a good group of girlfriends (YES!), we had a table (YES!), and we were all on a great level (YES!).  We had Dom in one hand, light-up baton in the other, and danced the night away  (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/hakkasan-las-vegas-nightclub-las-vegas-2?select=TlKuPAyQGHWSyHKAWlenig#JLdHcSRynz3EI7ZnGO3QxA).  In conclusion, we did have an amazing time, haha.  

We did try going on the dance floor but it was soooo packed!  People bumping into me left and right, it felt like I was dancing with 20 people at once.

Overall, Hakkasan was good, but not mind-blowing.  I was expecting something totally new but this club will be pretty crackin since they've got all the sick DJs!!",8,2,6

We paid the $100 per ticket VIP tickets.  What a joke.  We still stood in an hour long line.

We were warned by the guy tending to the elevators that it would get even worse.  By the way I made the mistake of stepping into an elevator and pushed the button only to be scolded to not touch the button.  I laughed since I thought he was joking.  The elevator attendant takes his job very seriously.

In order to have any sort of breathing room without having someone's privates all up on me or having my ass groped, which I encountered as we were looking for a place to at least stand, we felt we had no choice but to purchase a booth.

You buy a booth, but at the end of the night the place is super packed that you get people sneaking into your booth.  We caught someone trying to take a bottle of our vodka.  Security?

Was absolutely blown away. the opening DJ was dope as hell...had a great mix and felt the crowd to get warmed up. layout was surprisingly dope, the dance floor I was able to get around a bit....sound system was tremendous and they had FREAKIN CRYO BLASTS COMING DOWN FROM THE CEILING ON TO YOU. That was just insane...video screen above the DJ and they had a second level with choreographed dancers to the performance.  Just freakin incredible, I was really really impressed with the venue and Bob Sinclar was dope as hell.

This club's layout is a lot different than the clubs in Las Vegas. It has levels which is interesting. Overall I really like this place. The crowd was a bunch of convention nerds which was a great one. It tends to get a little packed on the dance floor but we did go on a busy weekend.

When we arrived around 11:30 after taking our time to get dolled up, there was a never ending line for people trying to get in. I had some sort of question and ended up approaching one of the managers who ended up escorting us to the front of the line. While that was flattering, I felt horrible for everyone needing to wait in that ridiculous line. Basically the same rules as anywhere else apply here at Hakkasan x10. If you've got a massive group of females - you're entitled and are able to enter immediately. If you're a male, particularly a group of males, you get robbed of all the money you have after you've waited in line for 3 hours. 

I was lucky enough to have been let in and we had a great time time the first night. There was no event going on but the music was spot on to our taste - hip hop\/R&B, throwbacks. Everyone was on the floor having a great time. Drinks were good but expensive as you'd expect, lucky enough to have them bought for me. Then the dreaded happened - my 5 day old phone was stolen out of my purse! We ran to find Hakkasan personnel and happened to be the most unhelpful, unsympathetic beings I've ever met. =( Given the nature of the establishment they must assume everyone they speak to is sloppy drunk, that's the type of attitude I received and was questioned how someone was able to take my phone out of my purse and me not realize it. Seriously? I was incredibly upset and sadly not drunk - the little buzz I had going had completely diminished upon learning my phone was gone. 

We went back the following night after getting on a bottle service list for Lil John. We had a great time, awesome seats and private dance area and unlimited alcohol. 

The lines and their standards really infuriate me along with the way the staff felt it was appropriate to speak to their guests in such a manner. Two stars off for that.",1,1,1

The only purpose for my second visit was for a friends 21st birthday party after a guy working there (who will rename unnamed) said that we could get a table with 8 girls on a Sunday night. Keep in mind: we are all locals and Sunday IS industry night. 

So, he SAID we could get a comped table, the day of said no problem (at 5pm) and at 8pm decided to bail out. No apology and no reason. 

We decided to go in anyways cause by that time it was too late to get on a guest list anywhere else. And man, the line was much longer than it was opening day. After waiting what seemed like an eternity I'm glad the staff or management had a change of heart cause I didn't have to pretend I was in work-out clothes hiking up four flights of stairs, they let us take the elevator!!

My experience here the second time was a LOT more fun. Probably because I came with a big group of pretty gal's and we were able to swoop in on some tables. Jk, but seriously. I think they were also able to work out some of the kinks and everything just seemed to go a lot smoother. Hosts were ""recruiting"" girls into more exclusive areas which made the experience a lot more memorable.

One thing that really confuses me is all of the other nice nightclubs in Vegas have toiletries for girls - perfume, tissues, deodorant if necessary. Hakkasan had none of these..and for a nightclub that is trying to run XS out of business, you are not doing a very good job. (Just saying)

Hakkasan Las Vegas is doing a lot better now than they were doing in April but can still use some improvement. I have another friend who is visiting in July and is DYING to see Calvin Harris so stay tuned for another review..hopefully it will be four stars the next time around.",7,4,3

They claim to be one of the biggest night clubs in the world, so I was expecting a huge dance floor and a cool electronic vibe like i remember from ""The Wave"" in Honolulu -- not even close I know people with houses that have bigger party rooms than the main or secondary dance floor.

Also given the tiny dance areas you couldn't design a worse ""traffic flow"" if you tried, it's impossible to get anywhere, because people that want to dance have to do it in main traffic ways and within a few feet of the bars and bathrooms.

Beyond that they open at 10 and the main artist isn't on until 1:30 -- but despite a massive number of leather couches everywhere, you're literally not allowed to sit ANYWHERE unless you buy bottle service, which is ungodly expensive -- I do mean anywhere, if you don't get bottle service you will stand the whole time.

It was $80 something to get in the door and a single beer was $10, want a water? $9 for what anyone would consider a half bottle.  I bet I would have enjoyed this place if I'd have had $1k to drop on an evening, but then again I can think of a lot more fun stuff to do with $1k in Vegas.",15,1,0

I must say it's probably my favorite new club to party in Las Vegas. Place is massive. 5 floors, isnt it?? You can get lost in there. In a different way than getting lost inside Marquee. The sound and the lighting in both the main room & the Ling Ling are really good... really good. I'm sure they spared no expense. To me, it has raised the bar in Vegas nightlife experience.

Fortunate enough to have a friend of a friend that works there as a VIP host so he set us up with our bottle service reservation inside the Ling Ling. The Ling Ling room is downstairs and is primarily known as the hip hop room. The night we went we had DJ Krooked from Skam Artist crew spinning. We're lucky enough to have some friends that are DJs under the Skam management so they were able to tell Krooked to shout out my friend for his bachelor party. Good times. The music was good. The bottle service hosts we had were super cool, not to mention, beautiful... One nice thing they thought of at Hakkasan was that at our table in the Ling Ling, the seats had storage space under for the ladies purses.. and phone charger connections for EVERY phone imaginable. Hell yesss!! Everyone knows, by that time of the night\/morning in Vegas... your phone is dying, if not, already dead. I truly believe they thought of every thing when they designed this club. 

We had friends that same night who had bottle reservations above the main room who had Laidback Luke performing that night. We went to go check it out and it was also amazing. The music being played, the laser\/light show, the performers on stage, the performers\/dancers above the stage, etc.. Everything was top notch. Im sure bottle reservations in the main room are much more than the Ling Ling and for some people it is more than worth it. I can see why.

That was my first time at Hakkasan... We went again in November and once again got bottle service in the Ling Ling through our connect there. And once again our bottle hostesses were super cool and super lovely. We had a great time... If it wasnt for the homie discount, I'm not sure we would be getting bottle service every time, as I know it can get insanely pricey depending who the headliner is for the night. Tiesto, Calvin Harris & Avicii are all resident DJs there. Now I am in now way an EDM junkie but even I know those are the heavy hitters. The night we were there the Ling Ling had DJ Gusto, another Skam Artist DJ. The main room was Dada Life. Music inside the Ling Ling was really good playing that typical Vegas Top 40 hip hop & some classics mixed in. We went to check out the main room and Dada Life had the crowd going insane. Found myself on the main room dance floor and the energy was amazing. Gotta love Vegas for that.... 

Check Hakkasan out. My advice. Get bottle reservations. The line to get in on a busy night in which a big name DJ is performing or if it's a fight weekend will be ridiculous. I highly suggest getting a table, if not... Buy pre-paid tickets. Too much stress going on. Too hectic... You'll see. Still... Gotta love it tho. Hakkasan is great classic Vegas times... Cant wait to go back. 

We want DJ SKRATCHY in the Ling Ling room, please... And more of DJ VICE in the main room.",2,2,2

There were no lines for VIP guests, and the guy who was handling the list was a total asshole, letting people who he knew in only and making up the excuse that they didn't have enough runners, but some how those people who came in late were able to pass everyone else.

To me Hakkasan just feels very capitalist with very little regard to guests. They attract huge crowds by bringing in the worlds best DJs. To be fair, the talent they bring in is absolutely ridiculous: Tiesto and Calvin Harris have residencies, and equally big-name DJs are regular at the club. In spite of that, its made a lot less fun by the dangerously overcrowded space. On the main dance floor, there's no room to move let along dance. If you pause to stand in one of the throughways or stairs, the staff will berate you until you move. The only folks who appear to be enjoying themselves are those who booked tables, which are lucratively expensive anyway. The Ling Ling lounge downstairs is less crowded (but still, pretty crowded) and plays hip hop music. 

I think Drai's and XS are much better places for folks who like dance music and like dancing. Hakkasan is kind of miserable.",1,0,0

There is ZERO space to move or walk around. If you find a spot to hang your hat, bouncers will tell you to keep moving. Other reviews say ""if you are a girl, hope that some guys invite you to a table."" Chances are there are 100 girls hotter (by Vegas definition) than you and me in this club... I've seen them with my own eyes there. The girls that work there also fit into this category.

Hakkasan has the most incredible DJs headlining, no doubt. That is the only reason why people go. Unless you have a hard-on for Tiesto and have been dying to see him (like me), I would pick another club. It's not a pleasant clubbing experience without a table here. 

I also have a problem with one of the bartenders. You see, I used to bartend and always count the pours at each club I go to. I was surprised she was pouring 4-count (1 oz) drinks for $16 apiece. I would expect at least 1.25 in this town. When I asked what the pour was, she told me 1.5, and I asked her why she was pouring one ouncers instead. This is unacceptable. But she's hot, bitchy, and has the booze, so guess who ends up being right? And I still tipped her.

If your time is limited in Vegas, I recommend going to XS or Drai's for a fun experience with more room.  I'm grateful we got in for free, but even for free again with Steve Aoki or Calvin Harris headlining, I wouldn't come back. It's so beyond crowded that it's just not fun...

We are ownership members at the signature towers, which are getting dated, sadly :-(.. I took my dates down to the mgm nightclub, which is not owned or operated by the mgm resorts group, which is most likely why it does so bad in customer service.

As ownership we get discounted rates to enter the night club, we showed our passes to the door man and the two petite little women with me were told that they needed to check their coats prior to entering. I am not sure if anyone reading this is aware, vegas is a cold place, especially in doors.

I let the door man know that we were thinking over the coat check issue, I was not about to go inside only to hear two unhappy and cold women banter at me. The door man asked that we step over to the waiting line to not block the entrance, no biggy, we moved over. 3 guards immediately surrounded us and started starring down at me. 'DO WE HAVE A FUCKING PROBLEM' Mark the senior guard barked at me. No, we stepped over when asked and are thinking about the climate prior to entry. 

It is the experience of many here in Las Vegas, if the club is not owned or managed by the resort it will not be a happy place :-(...

I love this place!! Been here at least 5 times and now also did bottle service (upstairs, right in the middle, perfect view)

I've read that they push people into your table, etc. that was not the case at all with us. It was just my husband and I, and we occasionally let strangers in our table for a better view for a few moments, and each time security would confirm with that if these people are ok or of we want them out of our table. 

None the less, the bottle service girl (which was very attentive and checked on us frequently) stood by the rope majority of the night anyhow. 
Ain't no body getting in unless you okay it. 

Only down fall was when they had to move us to a corner table downstairs around 3am, cause the top floor is closed, but that's okay cause we had a blast up there. 

My only recommendation is if you book a table, contact a legit promoter of the club, not a third party. Our guy really did as he said and gave us the exact table we reached out to him about. We were very happy!! 

And if you're not at bottle service, you can still have fun, just get there early, find a spot at good view and stay there all night. at least that's how my husband and I do it and we've always had a good time.

We sucked it up and decided to pay to get in because we felt we would not get in considering our place in line. (Upon seeing how crowded it was when we entered, we were right). The first time my friend asked how much is was, it was $50 for ladies. 5 min later after my friend came and got us the rest of us out of the guest list line, it moved to $60 already even though she asked the same guy.

Warning for ladies - tons of stairs. Don't wear your highest heels or anything uncomfortable since you will have to go down the stairs when you leave (no elevator for public use)

Also, it was super crowded inside the club, which is understandable since it was Calvin Harris. If you didn't have VIP, good luck trying to find somewhere to stand other than the dance floor.

Everyone working in this industry should know and value the importance of customer service, especially in Las Vegas. People travel from all parts of the world to enjoy an extravagant weekend in the one&only Sin City. So to be mistreated, disrespected, and borderline harassed before even starting a vacation is unacceptable. 

Let me explain. 

I go to Vegas a lot. And I know a wonderful promoter who always hooks it up. She doesn't work for Hakkasan, so we went through a different promoter that my friend got the number for. Dan. He told us that our guys would have to pay - and that's fine. We understood, but didn't want to go to Hakkasan and pay over going to XS for free. 

The text my friend sent was incredibly polite: 

""hi sorry I think we're gonna pass cause we can get the guys into the other clubs for free. thanks anyway tho! I'll text you in the future :)""

Among other things, he responded with this:

""Ur gonna favor free & have an experience prob bad because we dominate sundays vs. having time of your life which is ur coming to Vegas."" 

""whoever u talking to is miss leading you"" because XS charging is ""commonly known""

and repeatedly said that Hakkasan was the #1 club in the country. 

1) No need to put down other clubs or the fact that our guys don't want to pay
2) Don't tell us we won't have fun unless we come to your club
3) It's not all about being voted number 1 by a magazine, it's about customer service and relations and in the few months that Hakkasan has been open, they can't even beat a subpar tier 3 Vegas club on Yelp - that's probably due to poor customer service.

If this club expects to compete with XS, Marquee, & Surrender once the hype has died down, they should reevaluate how they treat potential guests at their club. 

I still plan on going to Hakkasan and I do look forward to seeing what all the hype is about. I believe that the owner of the club and those working have put a lot of hard work into making a new and exciting atmosphere for EDM lovers. But until I see for myself, my only impression of the club is through our interactions with the club's promoter - whose role is to represent and ""promote"" the club. Instead, his aggressive assertion of Hakkasan's superiority to all other clubs in Vegas and condescending response at our polite refusal of his offer left a bad taste in my mouth.",23,6,4

Now for some tips: 
1. If you are a female, Vegas is geared towards you. Clubs want to let you in, for free hoping to get guys to come, for a fee. Make some calls, check out Yelp or Instagram to figure out how to keep extra money for shopping! 
2. Again, females- dress accordingly! Not sure why I see females looking like they are in pain and taking off their heels before the night even starts. Remember, it is safer to wear shoes you already broke into rather than try something new! 
3. Do not be that ratchet drunkie! Handle your liquor. Nothing worst than watching a girl puke all over her cute dress while some dude holds her up and bystanders taking pictures. 
4. Do play at the slot machines and come up on some free dranks before coming here! Play a bit, wave down a cocktail waitress, tip well and she will return!

However, this club impressed me. I went in with not so high expectations based on the mixed reviews and came out so WOWed out. I went during EDC Thurs night with Hardwell and yes it was packed as crazy. But what do you expect? It's a Vegas club with big name EDM dj's! 

Got prepaid tix, we went to that line before midnight and there was NO WAIT. The process was smooth, check ID, check tickets, get stamped, get IN. DONE. Take the elevators to the actual dance floor. I have one excellent thing I need to point out, its the BOUNCERS. THEY WERE FRIENDLY. WTF?! All the bouncers I've encountered were douches. But these guys answered my BF's questions and mines with ease and tried to help us. They were incredibly nice, both inside and outside bouncers. The ones inside were super nice when we were trying to find the hip hop room. HUGE PROPS. If Hakka keep this up, they'll definitely attract a much larger crowd. 

Upon entering, the lights blew me away. Blue and pink lights, SO PRETTY! The dance floor at the main EDM area is HUGE, bigger than Marquee. There are several bars on the sides to get your drinks. We were looking for the hip hop area just to check it out before we settled for Hardwell, but found out they were using that floor for EDM for that specific weekend. So a bouncer guided us to another area, a lounge thats connected to HAKKA! We walked in and it was EMPTY! Hella chairs, tables, and and an empty bar to chill. I recommend everybody to go there to use the bathroom, get drinks, rest your feet, etc. Omg, can't believe it was empty. People complaining about where to sit? You're not looking hard enough. After all, it is a Vegas club and they do like to make $ off bottle service. No sitting is a given, get used to it.

Anyways, during Hardwell, the dance floor was packed of course, but it was incredibly FUN. The lights were amazing. The screens\/visuals were very clean and new, so the graphics looked AMAZING. I didn't want to leave but it was near 4am. Tiesto came out surprisingly to dance with Hardwell... AMAZING! 

Want great EDM music, lights, lasers, visuals? COME TO HAKKA. The girls with ram outfits dancing above the stage WERE AWESOME. I was so amused by their dance moves that I forgot about Hardwell. 

I will definitely be back here now. This blows XS out of the water. Not sure how GL works on regular weekends, but I'd just buy tickets to avoid the line and hassle. Only $20 for girls!",10,6,8

I happened to bump into one on the staff and he made a huge deal and called security.. keep in mind im just a 95 pound 5 foot girl.

This place has potential, but I probably won't be back any time soon. It's an overall cool looking venue ... but reminds me a lot of Marquee in the sense that it's not very people\/dancer friendly.  I still prefer XS to here... nothing compares to the openness of XS.

For starters, this venue has a million and one too many stairs. To get to the main floor, you have to go up three flights of stairs. Then once on the main floor, there are steps all throughout the main floor.  I can totally see someone eating it pretty hard on the stairs.  Heck, I wouldn't be surprised if I ate it while sober! It's just so dark and packed that it's really easy to trip on a step.  

This place was packed when I went and probably had a female to male ration of 10:1.  Great if I were a guy or into chicks, but I'm not, so that sucked too.  I understand that it's opening weekend and it was apparently a star-studded event (GQ launch party or something), but it was just too packed with no room to dance on the dance floor (which they closed off bc it got too crowded) or in the random pockets of spaces.  My friends either got shooed off by security or got pushed and shoved by the others trying to pass through. We called it a night at 1:30 before Calvin Harris even came on because it was just too annoying to deal with.  

This place is also definitely tailored to bottle service. There are tables EVERYWHERE. Great if you're baller status and can actually afford a table, but I'm not, and so that sucks for me. 

Pros: PLENTY of restrooms. There's a hip hop room and an upstairs bar area (but again, another flight of stairs... and MORE tables... and the sound isn't as great up there).

Overall impression was it's a cool place, but overhyped. I'd go again when the hype dies wayyy down.",6,0,1

The main issue for why I won't come back is they have a major theft issue which security doesn't seem to take seriously. 3 out of 4 of my group had our phones pick pocketed and many others in our vicinity as well.

Our group of 6 went in on a Thursday night really excited about the venue. Any positive vibes were washed away within the first 15-20 minutes after we took in the scene from the bar upstairs.

My wife paid $20 for a drink that was made horribly (unfortunately she tipped the bartender $6) and then minutes (and a few small sips) later, she was horrified to see something stuck to the INSIDE OF HER GLASS. We all took a look at it and it appeared to be OLD CHEWING GUM!

I walked with my wife and her disgusting drink to the same bar where she bought it from and asked for a manager. The female from security (who, BTW was the friendliest and most helpful person in the place) got on the horn and arranged for a manager to meet us next to the bar.

The clown we ended up dealing with clearly had zero experience in dealing with upset customers and steadfastly refused to get my wife a cash refund. He offered us another drink, which we refused, as the rest of our group left the venue in disgust.

I told him, ""If you order a salad, and a quarter of the way into the salad you find a hair in it, are you going to order another salad? NO, you're going to get your money back and go somewhere else. that's all we want to do.""

Even worse, he told us that they were going to ""dock the bartender the amount of the drink + tip."" I asked him how that was fair to the customer, when the club would win twice by taking our money AND the bartender's money as well. He froze in silence and then came back with the most false, half-hearted ""well you both have my apologies."" WTF does your meaningless apology do for us? I told him congratulations for representing his club so well and we left frustrated.

On the elevator ride down, one of the attendants could tell we were upset, so we gave him a brief recap. As we exited the elevator, he instructed us to wait in the hallway that leads to the exit, saying ""don't move, stay right there, I'm going upstairs to get an Ops Manager."" Literally 30 seconds after he left, another member of the security detail saw my wife & I standing there and yelled at us to ""get outside"" and that we ""couldn't stand"" where we were any longer. I tried to explain to him that another staff member had just told us to stay put and he said, ""I don't care what he said, get out and wait out there.""

This is another of the many issues that plague this venue...too many security people wandering around with ZERO people skills. It is clear that this venue is all about the almighty dollar and could care less about how its customers are being treated once they have paid their money to get in.

We spoke to an Ops Manager as we stood outside the club, and we were given the same nonsensical explanation about why they could not refund my wife her money. I told this guy that regardless of the many complicated (more like non-existent) policies when it comes to customer care, why not take the attitude of ""the customer is always right"", go get my wife her $26 back, and then work out the rest of the minutia internally. Of course, like expecting to go here for a good time, it was a dead end.

There are so many other options in Las Vegas, and this venue was just deleted from our list.

I had texted all the hakkasan promoters and they basically were pretty much unwilling to help. They told me to go early and buy tickets at the door. So I went early (8:30 pm). They told us to wait so we did, while the presale ticket people just zoomed by. When asked, the staff said she was only in charge of presale and she did not know anything about our line. Really? your company is that disorganized? Anyway 2 hrs later our line still did not move at all. When asked they said we will get in shortly and that price to get in would be 150. At that point, I was already fed up. presale ticket was 75 and they were in the club 2 hrs before I was. I was not going to wait another 2 hr and pay twice as much as someone else, so I just left.

I came this past weekend for Tiesto only. I repeat, I only gave this place a second chance because of tiesto. having learned from last time, I made sure I got the presale tickets. Again the staff at the front of the line were rude. They didn't seem like they wanted you there, but at least I didnt have to wait in a three hr line to get in this time. They scanned my ticket and I was in within 2 minutes. Then I was led to a line for the elevator. At that time, I did not know I was waiting for the elevators, I thought I was in another line to get in the club. A girl in front of me had to ask the staff if she could use the stairs and my group followed. This is awful. No body even said stairs were an option, the staff just assumed and shoveled us to the huge line for the elevator. Had it not been for the girl in front of me asking, I would have been stuck waiting. Tip for all those thinking of going, just take the stairs. If your not actually disabled, you can climb three flights. Sure beats waiting.

Inside there is a floor for hip hop music (Its called Ling Ling). This was great because it was less crowded so I could get my drinks and dance to some hip hop before seeing Tiesto. 

After we were done with that, we went to the main electro floor. It was super packed here and you could barely move. so it was hard to dance.

Id say the only good thing about this place is the actual club and the resident DJs. The club is nice and high end. The music was great due to the awesome DJs (tiesto, calvin harris to name a few). But thats pretty much all i liked about hakkasan. 

Will i come here again? probably not, unless my group of friends wanted to, or it was on a day my favorite DJs were playing. The two stars here are for the club design\/feel and DJs only. Management and experience pretty much sucked. This place definitely needs a redo in staff. For a high end place, i expect more. For people looking to have a good time go else where. if you dont care about experience or willing to endure suffering, this place is perfect for you.",3,2,0

What an enormously disappointing experience. I know Vegas is a money-grab, but my group was more than willing to shell out dough for a good time. Instead, it was angering.

We came here with the intent to dance our butts off and watch Tiesto. We left shortly after Tiesto's first song because there was no space and the bouncers were rude.

THE GOOD
First, get on the guest list and arrive in the evening before 10:30pm so you can get in for free. Entry comes with a free drink ticket. Although the line was long, it moved pretty fast and it was pretty cool to see us progressing through this large club. Dance floor was rockin' at about 11pm with good beats and some nice people milling around us. 

THE BAD
My group got their drinks quickly and then subsequently tried to wave down the bartender for water. Bartender ignored us and even motioned us away. As the night went on, the floor got more packed to the point where we just didn't have room to dance. There were also a ton of men clogging up the dance floor standing there looking either stoic or annoyed.

THE UGLY
To allay some of our irritation, one of my friends went and bought a round of Grey Goose shots. We sipped the shots, and nearly gagged. NOT Grey Goose whatsoever. We've been working on a 1.75 liter bottle in our hotel rooms, so we know exactly what it tastes\/feels like. Disgusting practice!

We then asked for water and ended up paying $10 for a tiny Fiji bottle. My friend also paid another $8-9 for two tumbler glasses with ice. There was no other way to get water aside from drinking it through a tap in the bathroom. Really?

The last straw was when we tried to get back on the dance floor because Tiesto was up. With my bachelorette sash and get-up, I led my party through the floor of bodies, aiming for an empty space near the side. Note: We are mainly a group of size 0-4 girls. I must've pushed past a bouncer's elbow\/arm because he flipped out and yelled at me ""What the hell are you doing!?"" And of course, I had to apologize. I've never had this problem elsewhere at any club ever. People push and I wasn't trying to shove anyone maliciously. Get over it.

After that, we left. Hakkasan is a beautiful nightclub, but overrated. I recommend the club-hopping package for a better experience.",5,3,0

My first night I was really exited to see this 120 million $$ club. and it was nothing but disappointment.

overall it was very ugly and poorly done.

The drinks are expensive but that is just Vegas, however Hakkasan seemed pricier. The bouncers were nice but they looked like they hated their lives because the club is designed poorly and it only makes their lives harder.

The second time i went it was only because I was dragged by friends who really wanted to see Hakkasan... I told them it is a waste of time and money. they did not listen. tho today, they all 100% agree that Hakkasan Nightclub is a terrible choice.

We arrived on Thursday 6\/20\/13 for the Hardwell, Dannic & Dyro Record Release party. I had a few friends visit for opening weekend in April and they told me that I would be blown away. Boy were they right!

Coming from Seattle, our best nightclub is Foundation in Belltown. Hakkasan is like Tao, Lavo, Marquee Beach, and Foundation taken up a few decibels to the point that they pale in comparison. 

The club is literally  stories high, so ladies please practice walking in your stilettos. Otherwise you'll be waiting in line for the highly sought-after elevators on the bottom floor. Each level has different bar and dancefloor areas, however the night we went was absolutely packed beyond belief for Hardwell. There was hardly any standing room, and while my boyfriend and I love dancing and clubbing and are used to being packed like sardines, it was a little too much. Hardwell still hadn't come on at 1:30 which we found a little insane, but overall the experience was AMAZING. 

The lighting and lazers inside were spectacular. The scaffolding on the ceiling is even in the Hakkasan logo! The production behind each set is superb and unlike anything I have ever seen. 

Tip: ALWAYS buy presale tickets. Presale ticketholders have a special expedited line. Also for guys: Wear nice dress shoes\/slacks. Jeans are barely allowed in. Do not wear rave attire (ie: kandi, bras with skirts) because the dress code is strictly enforced and we saw people getting turned away.",0,0,1

A) Why did you require a member of our party to remove their sunglasses? That's so random and overbearing 

B) Why did you permit some tables to fill and overflow way way beyond capacity, but then harass other groups for where their members stood? 

C) Considering an edm dj was playing, why was your security so overbearing about the use of led rave lights? (Photons)

In all three cases nothing harmful was being done, yet security was a consistent presence regarding those things throughout the night (despite none of us being wasted or rude to others). It's a club- let people have some fun if they aren't hurting anyone.

We were working directly with a promoter who got us all in to see Tiesto for free. Also, the promoter gave us VIP passes to go back where the DJ booth area was. There we were to share a table with another group with bottle service. We were even on the list...Well after about an hour of waiting to check in for the table and bottle service line (separate from the huge guest list line) we got into the club. Needless to say we were irritated we waiting an hour to just check in and get in, but we were still very excited to be in. 

The ambiance of the club was actually pretty awesome. The DJ booth was lit up and had a whole light fixture that went up behind the DJ booth that changed colors and light designs (very cool)! Here's where the problems began...this club although huge felt tiny because they jam pack it full of people. There is nowhere to stand, let alone sit. I see where people say it's a fire hazard because frankly, it is! As soon as you find a clearing of people to stand the bouncers are moving you along so you're not ""blocking"" the way for other people. The dance floor is tiny compared to other clubs like XS and Marquee. Also, there was not a good mixture of people there. I hate to word it this way, but it was an Asian invasion...I have no problem with a certain race or ethnicity, but come on, bring in a mixture of people!

After the initial overview of the club we headed towards the VIP area. We handed our slip of paper that granted us entry to this area only to be denied...The bouncer apologized and said that there were too many people in the VIP area already and we couldn't get in unless some people left. Wow! This was irritating. I would say if we were a group of overweight, under dressed, not-so-cute girls, that okay maybe they didn't want to hurt their image. But, we were dressed up, hair done, makeup done, heels on, and we're all very cute I must say! We hung around the bar to see if anyone would leave (although we found that it would be unlikely). There were so many people crowded around the bar, we were being pushed around, some guy spilled his drink on my friend because he was too drunk to stand, and overall it was just too many people everywhere. We're all frequent club-goers and have been to many clubs before, but this one is hands down the worst. It's a shame because the atmosphere is so cool in there, but they need to stop letting so many people into the club and keep it more exclusive in general. 

I probably won't go there again. It's a shame because so many of my favorite DJ's have residencies here. I'll stick to XS and Marquee! Note to Hakkasan employees: learn better customer service and how to accommodate the amount of people that come through the club.",7,3,0

None of that was delivered.  I won't go much into the crowd there,  bit I'll add that perhaps im too used to the homogeneity or the DC crowd.  The club was, as expected insanely crowded with not much room to enjoy yourself until much later in the night.

That being said,  the sound system on the first floor was not only insufficient,  but downright unpleasant.  Maybe that was just Calvin Harris and his lack of attention to detail.

The worst part is that it was in the MGM grand which now feels like a run down place in so many ways.",1,1,0

If I was in a situation where I could have had a table or bottle service I don't think I would have seen many negatives at all but being part of the general admission on a VERY crowded holiday weekend this can barely pass for a dance club.
To begin with the area in front of the stage to dance is TINY...really really small.  The biggest area is taken up by tables for bottle service. 
As well as a small dance area it was so crowded you couldn't even move around at all.  We found a spot to try and dance but it was like sardines and we were jostled the whole time. 
The staff were great I will say that.  One bouncer in particular tried to keep order on the stairs going down towards the dance floor and even stopped people going that way for a while... but the whole experience was a beating and we had paid good money for our general admission. It just wasn't worth the stress.

The dance floor is so small, and there are so many people. There's no outdoor area to chill so you're stuck in their small dark interior the entire time. Poorly designed because there's no way to know which way to go or which staircases to take. Very hard for drunkies to navigate since there are no signs and the staircases to diff floors are all spread out. It's like a dark maze!!! 

Drinks are ridiculously overpriced, at least $20 for an alcoholic drink and they are soo watered down. An AMF tasted like punch. They don't offer tap water or water fountains. If you're thirsty, you have to pay $10 for a TINY fiji bottle. Drain us of all our money, why don't ya?!

If you try to stay downstairs at the main dance floor, you will definitely be rubbing up on all the strangers around you. We could barely move there, so we spent half of our time walking around and going up and down all these staircases trying to find a good spot. We had to opt to dancing behind the tables by the bar until we decided that we would have a better time partying in our hotel suite.

Hakkasan is located in the old school MGM Grand Casino located right on the strip and accessible by Monorail.  Taxi rates will set one back a cool $50 if coming from the North end so plan accordingly.  

Lineup for the event started straight at 10:00 for ticketed clients.  The guest line and VIP line wrapped around the entire lobby of the casino.  We were very lucky to have had tickets first.

The host casino is old but Hakkasan has got to be one of the more modern, cool, and trendy clubs I have been in a long time that did not reek of flashy trash and balding agism usually associated with venues in the retirement mode.  The decor is dark with maroon and coral accents either via their lounges\/VIP booths, attendants were situated throughout the venue, including attendants in the restrooms, and they were very helpful as well as social with questions.

Drinks here, however, are quite expensive, so either come prepared with a lot of cash or make sure the date knows what they are getting into.  Our ""friend"" bought me two drinks that was over $40 with tax, so that sure beat the prices in the clubs I use to frequent in SF.

The resident DJ played a great range of music and it certainly set the evening as more and more people filtered in and out of the VIP booth area.  Our group found solace along the ledge\/bar table areas, but make sure you do not sit up on the ledge.  You will be kindly requested to jump off.  This spot is great for people observations via the light from the wall and various young men did the slow walk by for reconnaissance prior to swooping in for casual conversations.  

The club does get insanely packed, however, so be prepared to either come with a posse to protect your high heels and exposed toes, as well as other numerous body parts usually exposed in such places.

I had a great time at a neat club.  The DJs were great, Calvin Harris awesome, and despite the crowd being a little younger than myself, it was fun socializing with visiting lads from UCLA and then being invited to the Venetian later for even more dancing.

Guess I'm not that much of an old bag after all  ;-)",4,2,4

i was a huge raver from circa 1995-2001, starting with deep house around 1994, until eventually becoming a total 'hardcore gabberhead' raver, that would wear masks with the word ""house"" in a circle with a line thru it... so even though i don't currently listen to EDM leisurely, i still can enjoy and appreciate that 'scene'. And i have been for years still, when certain friends want to do that for the night.

And i know the deal: loud house music that leaves your ears ringing for days (i used to be a speaker-hugging Gabberhead) super tightly packed groups of humans, hot, sweaty and lots of pushing, shoving, uninvited contact and sometimes out of control emotions.

But still... Hakkasan? Holy shit... maybe it's because Im mid-30s and a father now, that i think more about the fire hazard before i think about the 'energy'. But all i could think was ""if we needed to get the fuck outta here, like NOW, we'd all be trampled in a huge bloody mess"".. but i was still able to have SOME fun. But that's also because I chose to...

It's real easy to lose your cool at this place and let it ruin your night. I chose to just go with it... the majority of my party didn't have the same thought tho. Understandably so...

All the reviews you'll read on this place are spot-on, no doubt about it. And i probably brought that up about 20 times last night (when we attended Hakkasan). Like ""Yep, the reviews all said it'd be like this"" and ""Yep, i totally expected this"" but even with all that i was STILL shocked.

They pack people in there like CRAAZY! And i mean it's so packed, that NOBODY has a chance, INCLUDING staff, INCLUDING ""VIPs"", nobody. It's so bad that i was feeling sorry for the staff, thinking holy shit and to think these people have to do this EVERY night?! My god, Id go insane.... one elevator attendant even said ""Bro, you dont even wanna know"" i said ""Fuck NO i dont wanna know, i've seen enough!""

i know i haven't really gotten to a real ""review"" of this place yet, but look... it is what it is. Its SUPER packed. A Jameson and soda is $16. There's no place to walk, sit and BARELY stand. You will be touching at LEAST one other person at all times, whether you know them or not, and at some moments people might even mistake you for a brick wall and just lean their entire body weight on you.

I think you can STILL salvage your night and have a good time if you go there already EXPECTING this. Because believe me, you won't be disappointed! But I still gave it 1 star, because well... this place sucks, haha.

Oh and dress code, you CAN wear sneakers. You have a way better chance if your sneakers are paired with a collared shirt, or some type of creative, hipster-ish outfit. Use your best judgement. You know what these bouncers, who have the same attitude with their ""authority"" as a TSA agent, look for in people.

And yes, forget about General Admission or Guest List, etc... buy presale, get there at 10, you'll be in super fast and you can have a chance to enjoy the place (for about 45 minutes) before it gets dangerously packed. I didnt get any asshole vibes from the bartenders, the staff was relatively cool (especially for their work environment) and the worst thing\/people you'll have to deal with are drunk douchebags on the dance floor.

If you plan on dancing, plan on dancing in one fixed spot, most likely just jumping straight up and down, and not without bumping someone constantly. Don't be a dick when you're there, MOVE if people are trying to get by, and be POLITE when YOU'RE trying to get by. Remember that nobody else is happy there (except for the DJs after they cash their $16 Million paycheck, lol) and that you CAN have a good time if you just allow yourself to.

Still tho, 1 star... fuck this place, haha. Dangerous as hell.... expensive as hell... Vegas is too big to squeeze into one little hole like this one.",16,8,3

Calvin Harris DJ'd Saturday. He did fine. I was kind of disappointed to miss Steve Aoki on Thursday and Deadma5 on Friday. You would think Saturday would be the prime time night. Oh well, I hear Tiesto is going to be their resident DJ. Great sound system and light show... actually probably the best light show I've seen in any Vegas nightclub (yes, including XS, Marquee, Tao, Tryst, Lavo, Surrender & Pure).

I don't know about the wait normally but at 10:30 p.m. (when we arrived), we were ushered right in (no wait at-all). However, it's probably notable that we had two booths, 6+ magnum bottles of Ciroc berry, plus 2\/3 of our 12+ party were thin gals in their early twenties wearing short dresses and heels. I heard that, around midnight, they were telling guys waiting in line (who did not have reservations or pre-sale tickets), that admission would be $200. This could have just been Hakkasan's way of telling people that they were not getting in.

Was celebrating my Birthday in Vegas with a group of my friends & we happened to be staying at The MGM Grand. We saw Hakkasan downstairs & heard it was the nicest club in Vegas so we said why not!?! We spoke to a promoter & got a table in the main room for Hardwell who was spinning that night. Even when you book a table there is still a line to wait in so expect that. After maybe 15-20 mins you will get to your host. They will escort you in the elevator to your table. The bottle service girls are all solid 10's & are very attentive.

As far as clubs go, this place is very nice. I haven't been to a club this nice since the mid 90's when South Beach was at its peak. This place is HUGE!
There are multiple levels & rooms for you to choose from. Expect to drop no less than $1000 for a table in the Hip-Hop room & from $2000+ for a table in the main room. There are actually table maps online if you have special requests for a certain location you want to be in. 

We had a blast so we decided to go back the next night for my favorite DJ, Tiesto since he was spinning on my Birthday. We booked another table(Slightly more $ since he is a bigger name DJ) & had another great night. The bottle girls came out with sparklers & confetti & a huge digital sign wishing me a Happy Birthday. This was by far my favorite part of the experience & luckily one of my friends recorded it for me.

The only real complaint I have is even when you book a table they will not give you water. They sell very tiny bottles of Fiji water for $10 a bottle so that really sucked. Other than that, the club is top notch. The sound system, music, club layout, temperature etc is all on point. 

Make sure to dress nice ESPECIALLY if you are not with any ladies. Guys, do not wear jeans or sneakers. Ladies, I'm sure you already know what to wear. Guys & Girls, expect to wait in a long line. You might get more slack on dress code if you are getting a table but that is just how some clubs work.",8,1,4

The club has 3 different lines, General admission, Guest list, and Staff guest list. I was on the staff guestlist, so check in took 2 minutes top, then we had to go in and climb a bunch of stairs to go to the club. After the first set of stairs, we arrived at a hip hop club, super small, but seemed nice. Upon going up ANOTHER flight of stairs, we made it to Hakkasan. Let me tell you.. The dance floor itself is SO small, and they block it off so people don't sneak into the reserved tables. Now, if you aren't able to make it on the dance floor, they do have places for you to stand and watch.. Walk ways.

I try to be very fair with my ratings but this place was just awful! I'm not sure what was worse the lay out the bouncers or the fact that they over packed the club which in a place full of drunk people is an awful idea! To be fair one of the bouncers was super polite and helped us when we needed directions but the remaining were unnecessarily aggressive. Also the fact that the bar did not serve free tap water to gentlemen is unacceptable. Not only is that Inhumane but a HUGE liability for the club. People are drinking and dancing inevitably they will get dehydrated. I was fortunate to be part of a group with a table so we could actually drink water! I was appalled to see that they did this too their patrons. What's more is that they over book the club. I love the vibe of big crowds but when the club is so crowded people are literally falling into my booth that is not ok. We could barley walk from our table to the restroom! And my friends were almost assaulted because people were cramped being stepped on thirsty and getting very aggressive. Clean up your act Hakkasan. Don't over fill your club. Serve your patrons water. Make it worth getting a table at your club. The only positive is the DJs they book. There are a lot of clubs that are as large look as good and have amazing lineups. I would not recommend coming here. Pay a little more and go someplace that will at least serve you a cup with some ice sheesh so cheap! That would never happen at any California club!,1,0,0

The ratio of men to women at Hakkasan was close to 4 to 1. Once we figured out to get to the dance floor it was all men and couldn't even dance it was so crowded. Women were sort of treated as a commodity trying to fill up tables and you were rejected if you weren't pretty enough (true story). Beyond getting you in, promoters didn't care if you didn't enjoy yourself. This all might be the norm but doesn't make it right. The starting DJ was meh.

We lined up, $40 later, coupled with a few shots, we marked our spot on the dance floor. The first hour and a half was pleasant then I was ready to leave as it got RIDICULOUSLY crowded, like fire hazard bad. Bodies up against each other that even if you were just swaying to the music, it would've been construed as unsolicited grinding. As I led my gaggle of gals towards an exit, one of the bouncers seemed more concerned that we were trying to crash the VIP section. He kept stamping the super heavy rope divider to maintain his territory-- nevermind that he kept smashing this pole right on top of my sandaled-foot. And nevermind that I  was screaming in pain at the top of my lungs in an already noisy club.

Eventually there was someone with a flashlight to clear us through. If you've got bags of money, I'd shell out for VIP. You'll breathe easier, feel more comfortable, and you'll get a great view of the silly little plebes in the pit down below.

Been here a couple times, but came here on Sunday of a three day weekend to see Steve Aoki. To my surprise, the club was packed! I didn't get into 12am, but the entire first floor was more crowded than its ever been when I've been in the club. 

Managed to get onto the dance floor where Aoki came on around 1:30pm. His set was crazy.  Instead of dancing and getting jiggy with it, he sprayed champagne bottles, threw cakes, had people crowd surf on inflatable boats, and used blasters to blast air! He also had everyone in the club turn on their phones and had a throwback moment. It definitely felt more like a concert than a club. Regardless, it was a fun time!

Based on various trips to Hakkasan, I must say I've had a great time on multiple occasions. 

Pros: huge club, rest\/chill lounging area, big dance floors, and hip hop floor!

Cons: feels like I'm in a bat cave, way too many stairs (we aren't wearing heels to hike), and can get way too crowded on holidays",0,0,0

Venue - 5 story venue with bottom 2 being the restaurant and the top 3 floors dedicated to the nightclub experience.......two rooms and a lounge spread out over 3 floors. Ling Ling Lounge is an intimate lounge area on the 3rd floor which has a separate room called the Ling Ling Club that usually tends to play open format (hip-hop\/top 40) records...The Main Room usually plays electronic dance music and is the 4th and 5th floor. They have a shit ton of tables everywhere and are almost sold out every night...I believe the only night club that has phone chargers built in the tables as well...Venue is not the most extravagant venue but compared to many nightclubs around the world it is in the top echelon

Production - Lot of lights and the sound system is good however not great as I have been here on multiple occasions where it's cut out...on special events they do deck it out with decorations which kicks the production up a notch...visuals are ok and when you are on the dance floor you tend to forget or even look up so while it's there it doesn't usually add to your experience like other nightclubs or festivals...

Talent - This is what I feel makes Hakkasan an elite venue. From their initial roster in 2013 to now it's filled with great talent...Hakkasan and XS are usually the two venues that give upcoming and rising talent a chance at the big shot in Vegas....2015 is no different with the face of Future House, Oliver Heldens, getting a chance to perform at Hakkasan

One suggestion I have for this place that may set them apart even further is to utilize the Ling Ling Room for more deep or underground dance music when their is open format being taken place in the Main Room.

When we arrived we had no issues getting in because there wasn't really a line so we got into the club within 5 minutes. There are many levels so we had to ask where to go to see Tiesto. There was a hip hop level which was pretty cool and not so crowded.
 Anyways, we go up to the level Tiesto was at and the amount of people in that floor was insane. There was no room to move and in case of an emergency there's no way you could get out of there safely. I am sure that they were breaking fire codes because there was no place to walk. Well Tiesto was great but it was hard to see him and a bit hard to enjoy the moment because of the number nof people. The price for the ticket was only 20 bucks so you can't expect much from that.

As the date grew near, I was then put in touch with the Director of Guest Services who would be on site that night - that person notified me that I would be given complimentary VIP entry and walked in.

We were placed on the guest list so we didn't have to wait in line very long at all.  It probably took about 20 minutes to get through the very long lines.

As soon as we got off the elevator, we were seated on the 3rd floor, I believe...I don't drink at all, but somehow that night was a blur because there were so much going on and so many people everywhere.  Our lovely hostess poured everyone a drink and asked me what I wanted.  When I told her I just wanted orange juice, she smiled and poured me a glass of OJ.  Beautiful and great service from our hostess!

The venue was very big.  There are multiple rooms\/floors with different music for each location.  My friends wanted to check out every floor so we made our way through the crowds and decided that we just wanted to go back & sit at our table.

I love Vegas for many reasons...the FOOD, the beautiful hotels, the fact that it's a city that never sleeps and you can wear whatever you want and no one will judge you.  However, I'm not big on clubbing and I do not drink so those fun factors do not attract me too much.  I'm pretty much what you would call a party pooper.  Lol

I ended up leaving the club before everyone else at around midnight.  I felt dizzy from all the loud music, the dancing lights, and the walking back and forth.  However, I have to admit that was the best glass of OJ I've had in a very long time.  Must be because it was served to me by a very beautiful lady...hehehe",8,6,7

We came here on 11\/9\/17 & the Dj was all over the place with his music choices.

Hakkasan and Omnia share the same resident DJs but the club life is very different. I can honestly say that a line at Hakkasan is ten thousand times longer than a line at Omnia HOWEVER I have gotten pretty lucky at times where I've only had to wait about half an hour before getting in. 

This club is T-I-N-Y! So if you don't have a table or a sky villa be prepared to share some personal space with a LOT of strangers! On given nights they'll give free drink tickets to ladies, which I love, but most other times they'll just get free entry for even ratio. 

Highly recommend seeing a Dada Life show as it is unlike any other performance you will ever experience. My next performance will definitely be Hardwell but I can only imagine how long the line will be. 

Pro tip: when the promoter gives you a certain timeframe to come to the club, come AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE! I'm not kidding, these lines are incredibly long and you will regret coming later on in the evening!

Other than that, this is a great club with a smaller hip hop lounge called Ling Ling Club and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good time with some good vibes.

The 1 star is due to the atmosphere. We're thirsty after a little while, and go to the bar to ask for a cup of water. We're informed that this club doesn't do that, and if we want water, we can spend $9 for a 300mL bottle of Fiji water. I drank some water from the tap in the bathroom and the attendant threatened to kick me out...for drinking water!! 

I talked to some of the bouncers there, and every single one of them looked so unhappy, and sounded unhappy. They told me about how they only got 10 min breaks (no lunch) and had to just stand there for 8 hours. They apparently don't get free water either.

Went to vegas for a friends birthday. He get's kicked out of Marquee for being drunk (he didn't seem like it), somehow we decided to come here and it wasn't what we wanted. 

-Close to $100 to get in for 2 (1 guy 1 girl). 
-Super long lines (unless it's around 1AM) 

Venue looks pretty nice from the outside and it seems to be the club everyone likes going to and I am still not sure why. Our friend got kicked out of Marquee so we decided to come here, fine. It's extremely expensive and overpriced but everyone wanted to go, so we pay close to $100 for 1 guy and 1 girl, fine (probably could have bought bottles with that cost). We go in and it's super packed and crowded and no space to do anything. You literally have your own space and that's it. DO NOT think about moving because it's not possible without pushing everyone around. There's a crap load of bottle service tables and a super small dance floor. We had to hug the back wall and ""dance"" i.e. nod our heads like we had space to dance but actually not be moving. They did play some decent songs every now and then which is the only positive. The idea of not being able to move or dance was not appealing at all. We all left after an hour at most. So it was quite the waste. I think people could have had more fun losing money in the casino but getting free drinks and hanging out with friends than at that club. Best of lucks to the guys who go and try to pick up girls or girls who go and try to get picked up by guys, you have no space to walk none the less find a guy or girl to hit on. 

Tips: 
1) Get a promoter to get in for free or buy bottle service so you have your own space
2) Get a bigger group, build a circle or a wall and hold down your space and don't let people push their way across if you want space to dance
3) Well try to have a good time because chances are if you are a guy you paid a pretty penny to get inside and if you are a girl and got in for free, well chances are you waited 2 hours to get in too so that inclines you to have a good time too.

My partner and I went to see Calvin Harris over Memorial Day weekend and yes, I was a little tipsy and wanted to dance with my partner, also male. The bouncers were hovering over us as if to harass us or scare us away and did this with numerous gay couples or parties that were in attendance. They would push us aside to let the ladies pass through, but would keep us as close to the barriers as possible. Also, the layout is just horrible. They have three levels of booths meant for bottle service that are blocked off and RARELY being used and you cannot stand near or, again, the bouncers get involved, even if you're simply waiting in line to get a drink (well drinks, even if it is Grey Goose, start at $18, so be prepared to pay a pretty penny while there; I suggest going to Centrifuge, first, and pre-drink for half the cost, but don't show yourself tipsy in line or they'll kick you out for an hour and tell you to sober up before letting you back in; yes, I witnessed this). Overall, not pleased with this experience and could not believe the lack of tolerance. Girl on girl dancing is perfectly acceptable, of course, but to pay $100\/ticket in advance to see a world-class DJ spin and to be treated in such a way, is just piss-poor and I hope they learn that this is unacceptable. Additionally, remove the first level of booths that go right up to the dance floor, taking up valuable space when the booths aren't even being used (too expensive, I assume). When we left around 2am, we counted all of three booths out of at least 50+ that were being used. Waste ... of ... space, time and money.",3,1,1

I very much believe that the vibe service and staff give off can affect the vibe of a party\/how people act and this was no exception. There were men trying to literally pull me out of our table and there was so much pushing and shoving that I was very intimidated by the idea of going to the bathroom - which is not usual, as I am a fairly experienced partier.

Music: There is no doubt in my mind that Hakkasan has the best residents DJ's in the game right now: Calvin Harris, Hardwell, and Steve Aoki are just some of the many that play there. I came here two weeks ago for Bingo Players and was definitely a happy camper. Although he is not as well known as the others, he played a really good set! However, I also want to commend Eva Shaw for her set as well. She was the DJ prior to Bingo Players and she was so good that I confused her work for Bingo Players at one point. Overall, I was really happy about the music aspect.   

Venue: The dance floor is pretty cramped and like others have said it does feel like you are packed like sardines. But if you stand towards the back where the tables are then there should be more room to dance.

Wait time\/ Guest list: My promoter in particular was very accommodating and got us into the club with no problem! As my promoter recommended, I arrived with my group at 10pm or so and the line was actually moving at a steady pace. I think we were able to get in within the first 30 minutes of the club opening.
(*** Guest list line is near Rainforest Cafe***)

Bouncers\/ Security: Let me warn you in advance, security will NOT HESITATE to throw you out or kick you out of line if you are too drunk! Enough said.  However, I do appreciate the fact that they do cut you some slack to let you re-enter the line\/ club after a specified time. For my group in particular, we had to sit outside for an hour before we were allowed to re-enter the line.

We were told by the promotor to come STRICTLY at 930pm so the girls could get in for FREE and the guy need to pay $30-$50 because of MARTIN GARRIX special performance. 

I told all of my friends to MAKE SURE everyone to come STRICTLY at 930pm.
Little that I know that all of my friends had their own things to do in Vegas. Some were gambling, drinking and about to get into fight. Some were about to cry over the boyfriend. Some wanted to sleep in the car. And me? I just run to take shower at the hotel and dress up and then apparently get lost and couldn't make u-turn to MGM hotel (where Hakkasan is).

So basically,  we only have 10 minutes to arrive in Hakkasan! 1 friend hasn't changed dress yet because apparently her dress is in my car! Gosh! So, I pulled my car at 3D parking structure for her to jump in and changed at back seat. Then we had to run with our high heels to Hakkasan to catch that 930pm slot. 
Sure enough, we run to the wrong direction which is Train Station (second floor of MGM) (?) 

By the time we were arrived at guestlist area, it was 935pm and weird thing was we were the FIRST one in line! We were told that it's opened at 1030pm. So since we were the first guest, the guys get in for FREE too. Yay!! 

Place is Moderately Big. 2 rooms (hip-hop and EDM). Smoking area next to hip-hop room.
Drink is same as West Hollywood standard price.

People dress-up in here: suit and dress. 

Much fancier than WeHo club, especially the bottle service,  instead of only LIGHTS, they pulled some stunts by marching bands, rhino girls, bathing robe girls, dragon cage and many more. Interesting!!!

We were told 60$ and was charged 110$. We were very first in line Saturday night, got into the club right @10 when it opened. We got to walk around and see how the entire place looked like. Wow! This is such a  gorgeous place, smells good, and very clean but once it hits 10-30-11 all the way on... it is body to body, & disgustingly, annoyingly packed. Apparently this isn't hazardous?.. they form a line to the dance floor too. I feel like you have to 'claim' a spot, camp out and make sure you have your drinks ready in hand. This place seriously doesn't limit how many people comes in probably because during nights with a headliner they need\/want to make their money. I wanted to give Hakkasan a chance so bad because this was the place I wanted to go to the most out of all the clubs there for my first time being in Vegas. Largest club in the world, not enough capacity to hold the people. May be they really need to take out the tables because seriously all the space that is taken up is not only by the people being squished in on a small dance floor but the tables also take up a lot of room. If you want to buy one, regardless of how expensive it already costs (close to 8grand and over), it is still sold out! I can't believe I was actually almost considering this.

Bought  an almost even ratio 9 girls 8 guys, NO free drinks. I had a lesser ratio of girls at the other clubs I went to and was definitely better taken care of. 

Here, they only cater to higher class people. Because they got the name and the fames. They wouldn't care about you unless your name is Rihanna. 

 900 dollars down the drain, spent 1 and a half hour to be treated like shit by the security guards &  employees. So, so disappointed. Walked all the way back to the hotel. 

They need to be more professional here especially if they are banking of hundreds of people. I'm never ever coming back again, I don't care who is the headline or what famous people attend. I will de-edify this to anyone I know. It is not worth it. Total Buzzkill.  Go on a weekday, it's probably a lot better. However, I'd rather you go somewhere where they care about your money.

I was with my girlfriend and we had 2 tickets for Steve Aoki and we were also at the guest list. We waited on the guest line for almost an hour and then suddenly a security guard approach by the guys waiting on the line behind us and told the guy he should go and change his shoes. He was wearing nike basketball shoes (not jordans, zoom basketball shoes). Guy was really pissed of but eventually he get out and changed his shoes. Then the security moron approached me looked down at my shoes and walk away. I was wearing Supra shoes and my GF had high heels. We waited in the line for another 30 minutes then another security moron approached me and told me that I had to change my shoes!! While I was arguing with them, they let a man with CONVERSES and another one with the most disgusting shoes I have ever seen, I mean the guy literally have white gigolo shoes. While I was trying to show them that they are letting people in with converses and stuff, another guy approached to me and asked the brand of my shoes!!! Told him Supra but clearly he had no idea what supra was. Eventually I get it by the look from their faces they have clearly no taste in fashion and its idiotic arguing with them. So I got back to my hotel which was close at least and changed my shoes. We waited another 45 minutes in the line and finally somebody let us in. After letting us in, another sec. wanted to search my GF`s purse. She opened it and yelled:`THIS PURSE SMELLS WEED`. Me and my GF asked her to search for her purse but sec. insisted calling his friends to look it up. So another guy approached to us with this evil look, judging because her purse smells like weed. Btw I did not mention that nearly everyone waiting in the line had vapes on them and most of them was drunk I saw people chewing gums like as if they are eating cheeseburgers!!! 

So we asked them to search her purse because we didnt have any weed and her purse wasnt smelly. They denied to search it and told me that: `you can go out and ask the police`. So if you are not there to search why do you search my GF purse ? I dont get it. You just contradicted with yourself. He was smiling when he told me that and I wasnt even sure if he really meant that. 

I was so frustrated I started cursing and yelling. I just take my GF and got out. When we were in the line some lady yelled ""this is a pervert club, beware"". I wish I listened to her advice and left earlier. We waited almost 2 hours in the line. People were yelly, drunk and awkward and we were really good looking (Im not an egomaniac but we really dress good). We are super chill people, when we were at the line we did nothing to aggravate the securities.

So to wrap it up: 
It is 100$ to get in and 20$ for the tickets.
Has the worst customer service ever.
Rudest security ever.
People in the line crazy, drunk, wasted.
Not worth the hype.",4,4,0

I worked with a GREAT promoter named Chris (hit him up, we got in free every night to any club we asked him for! (702) 722-8585) so the girls barely had to wait in line. Once inside, that's when we got the party started. I am not sure if drinks are pricey because people with bottle service literally waved us over and asked us to help them finish theirs. It's nice being a girl in Vegas lol!!

Aoki came on at 130 and the crowd went crazy! We avoided the dance floor (PACKED!) but could dance other places and still see Steve kill it. We never got told by security to move or got pushed, like a ton of reviews here say.

Just know what to expect when you come here. Work with a promoter, expect crowds, and yes, the stairs are a nightmare. I remember walking up them saying ""Hakkasan more like Hakka-STAIRS!"" Which made everyone around me crack up, lol!

To tell you the truth , I think I had a better time than some of the people on VIP. A couple people try to make me come to their VIP section but had to politely refuse  ""TWICE ""  just to show you normal people like me that don't want to spend a minimum of $2-3000 on bottle that sometime being on the GP is more fun than VIP.

I visited to see the Chainsmokers on 10\/18. My phone was stolen out of my purse on the jam-packed dancefloor. Seriously. They pack people into this place like sardines, and the dancefloor is full of bros who grope and push women around. 

And security? Yeah, don't expect them to help out if anything happens. When I realized my phone was stolen, I approached one on the side of the dance floor who proceeded to yell at me for intruding into the VIP area. I finally located someone who wanted to help me out (I couldn't hear his name. He was actually sweeping the floor. He had dark hair and glasses. He was the only helpful person in the place.) He directed me into a quiet staff only room where I thought I would fill out some paperwork about what's missing. The employee who watches security cameras in that room flipped out and told us we weren't allowed in there, so I had to yell out a description of what went missing over the blaring music in the club. 

I found out later in the night that security found my phone case (no phone) on the dance floor, but I wasn't told where, or if they would be checking cameras to find out any information, or if they would be doing anything else for me. It was basically not their problem any more, so they didn't help or show any compassion. I personally feel like when someone gets robbed at your establishment, a little empathy and assistance is the right response. Needless to say, I wouldn't recommend anyone visit Hakkasan. 

My situation aside, there's 5 floors of dark stairs that patrons have to climb to get anywhere in the club (not fun after a few drinks in heels. Poor planning.) If you don't buy a VIP table, it's hard to get around and have any space to dance and have a good time.

A misunderstanding of what the guestlist rules were between the check-in lady and the promoter led my group of 4 girls to wait for 2 DAMN HOURS, and we lined up on time at 11. Promoter assured me that I could get in fine by showing the entry people his text message. I explained it to the lady but she kept repeating ""No, your promoter told you wrong"" and BS like ""It doesn't work that way"". The girls were under my boyfriend's name so we got him to come out to check in and later she said with massive attitude ""No, I TOLD YOU, you can't do that"". Uhh what the hell is the problem? We have everything we need and we still can't get in? Even when I have ran into bumps getting into the Vegas clubs, the workers were always polite and showed sympathy.. but this chick must have been on her period or something. 

My promoter Lois was very nice and helpful, and rushed over to us to straighten things out. He got things fixed and told us calmly that I should have showed the girl his text, which I DID DO. Looks like she didn't even tell the whole story so she wouldn't look like a fool. She ended up having to let us in and came over with a defeated attitude to give us the comped ticket. Yeah well by this time, the club had to stop taking people in and stopped entry for over an hour.

If you're planning on hitting this club, all the standard rules apply. They will pack it wall-to-wall.  Their goal is to get you to buy a table.  If you're a guy, look good, and have lots of pretty little things hanging around you.  This is not the place to go if you're a group of nine and don't buy a table. 

Let me be clear here: It doesn't matter who you know, or what list you're on.  The only thing that matters is the money you are willing to spend.  The more money you spend, the better the experience.  Ever notice how the non-guestlist people get in first?  That's because they're paying.

As an EDM fan, this was built for us.  However, now there are too many fake EDM fans who only know the stuff on the radio and fill up the place with their drunk stupidity.  And that crowd might be the reason I may never come back here.

I visited this club last weekend (Memorial Day) and had one of my worst experiences. I am giving a list of pros and cons below.
Cons:
Smallest dance floor.
Bouncers are super rude.
80% of the club space is for table bookings.
You won't get a glass of water at the bar.
The clubs only interest is to make money.
You cannot sit anywhere for even 2 sec.
The clubs only intention is to extract as much money they can from you.
50% of the girls you see in there are employed by hakkasan.
I paid 145$ to get in there and came out in an hour.
Pros:(only one)
Tiesto.

This was our first time going and even dragged my partner to it whom was indifferent about it.  Sadly at the end of the night, it was the venue that left me shaking my head to hoping for better, and not because of DJ Aoki.  I would say the chief complaint is the lack of space.  It was so tight, people were pretty much forced to not dance and become stationary with hopes to be able to slide a fist pump in from time to time.  When you did hunt for a better location, be careful for the Bouncers are pretty strict about where you can stand thus forcing you to be as close as possible to the people next to you.  I also found it very amusing there was a guy there who had a gray T on, ball cap, jeans, and the 'bottom boob' of the guy's gut just hanging out over his jeans like a deformed muffin top right in front of Aoki.  Very interesting considering they have 'strict' dress codes.  He must of been bankrolling.  The sound system was excellent and the bass hits hard but I guess it would if everyone was crammed inside a hatchback of a Scion tC like how it felt in this club.  Everything is pricey but it's Vegas therefore not surprising.  The side shows\/visuals were pretty neat like when they had the drummer boy et al to give a personal celebration to the top shelf people sitting at the real expensive tables; custom signs, epileptic lights, and everything.  Though they get some world class DJ's, there are many other vendors that get the same so I wouldn't say this is something like an exclusive nightclub and as a first recommendation.  Also, we got there around 10:30 PM local time and Steve Aoki did not start his set until 2:00 AM local time.",0,0,0

I've always given Hakkasan a bad rap - tbh, I avoided it at all costs - but I had a fabulous experience and it deserves an update in my attitude.

First of all, they've renovated the club since that last time I was there a year and a half ago. My only sadness with this is that the Ling Ling room (used to play hip-hop) is gone... so no break from EDM if that's what you want :((((. The dance floor is still INSANELY packed, but there's plenty of room to lurk around teh side and stand on the table backs to dance with space and a good view. The upstairs VIP level was our favorite spot, because we lovedddd having our space to dance crazy the way we love! All the bouncers were super nice and even helped my friend run outside and grab cash with her debit with no hassle.

Coming into Hakkasan is an interesting experience.  On the one hand, it's a club that has a lot going on but the attitudes\/tight space may turn you off.  

That isn't to say that everyone was outright mean.  The staff was super friendly (at least in the beginning of the night) and helpful and people off the dance floor were not bad for the most part and getting in wasn't too much of a pain (with a pre-paid ticket - $30 for guys).  My complaints on people come into some of the really pushy guys and girls along with just some mean-spirited acts.  For instance, guys, come on - I saw someone in front of me do the 'dropped pencil' routine to try to fondle a girl from behind.  Not classy and not cool - giving a bad rep to all the guys out there.  The volume of the music by the way can get pretty loud too so be aware if you have sensitive ears.  Additionally, drink costs of course are high as always - note too that they don't serve tap water here - you have to buy a bottle for $9. [thumbs down]  One other note - the dance floor is really tight.  Expect to be squished in and get your feet stepped upon no matter how careful you are.  Also take care of your belongings in these cases.  

So with all these cons, what's left?  I think where it counts, Hakkasan is pretty amazing.  Big kudos to DJ Moby - he has so much energy where he gets on top of the DJ booth to get people hyped and his sounds are in your face and bold.  Bigger props to Mark Etson, the DJ before Moby that really held the fort down.  I've been to so many clubs where the first DJ has trouble establishing much of a groove and excitement but Mark handled his time like the main act.  Even though I was exhausted by the end of the night, the experience on the dance floor is worth it.  This is probably also helped by the smart lighting of the 'living ceiling' in which it seems like lights protrude out of the ceiling like blood vessels (couldn't think of a better analogy).  There's also a few other floors supposedly - on this night, only the Ling Ling Room with the hip hop was there.  Smaller dance floor and the atmosphere is very very different but it was cool to see the contrast and gives you options versus some other clubs.  

I did think Hakkasan was a little pretentious to begin with and the space area\/stairs\/elevators reminded me of Marquee in that the dance floor is squished and the people around you aren't exactly the friendliest bunch.  However, the music and atmosphere\/aesthetics really made up for it where it counted.",2,1,0

My experience was remarkably different and I attribute it to the fact that its not pool season quite yet and club crowds in Vegas are manageable. We got in with no fuss, no muss, stood in a single line compared to the 5 I was shuffled into before only to be rejected because of their own error. 

Once finally in the club there were a lot of stairs but if you cant handle them in heels than you probably cant handle dancing too long in them either so not a biggie.

Overall I have to admit I had a good time from what I remember, it was crowded but not obnoxiously so. I can't imagine coming here in the pool season and not having a table because you would be miserable. Definitely a VIP focused club. 

If I want someplace to get a table or come back in the off season I will definitely be back to Hakkasan. Otherwise I will stick with more open area clubs.",1,0,0

It certainly didn't blow me away. They make no effort at limiting crowd size so when my two buddies and I went on Calvin Harris night it was uncomfortably crowded. I'm not sure who was having a good time. I suppose if you wanted to drop 5k minimum on a table than you can shelter yourself from that. Otherwise I wouldn't go back to this club again especially if there is a major headliner in the club.

Speaking of C Harris, his performance was pathetic and I'm even a fan of his music. It was like he just plugged in his iPod and went to sleep. I'm embarrassed I paid what I did to see him. 100% not worth the high admission or frustration of having to combat the crowd.

Drinks: expensive, of course. I mean it's Vegas, no surprise here. 

Why I don't like Hakkasan: 
- NO DANCE ROOM. The dance floor is TINY! The first time I was there, (and keep in mind I was sober) I almost fainted! It was so hot and crowded and stuffy that I became light headed. Eventually I had to leave the club to get some air, but oh yah, NO IN AND OUT'S.

- SERVICE: people here are just not nice. Bouncers are unreasonble and mean.

A July 4th to remember though...for more reasons than one.  Anyway, to capture an image of what 2 stars means, you first have to break down the elements of a club that are vital and important.  

* Music-  They played EDM, house, hip hop, trance, etc. Overall pretty good music.  Depends on the DJ though. He can make or break the vibe.  The music was good but a bit loud.  Unfortunately we left before the last DJ.  I'm sure he would've pumped the place up a notch.  Then 3 stars would be in order. 
 
* Drinks- over priced and average at best. Seems like most reviewers experience the same. 

* Club layout-  many floors\/levels to choose from can be a positive.  Each level has its own music.  Something for everyone.  The negative is finding a place to rest your lower assets.  No seats available except for the couches that were solely reserved for the VIP table bottle service.  Btw, the entire balcony is only for bottle service victims.  The Vantage points were minimal, unless you were standing in the stair sections.  Especially when you have a clear view of a very attractive woman in a skin tight bright orange one piece dress sitting on the top part of the couch movin n grovin to the music, while sitting.  Didn't get up for no one.  Except the time when she got up to share a cheer with me.  We said a few words, then she went back to her spot.  It appeared like the managers gf, as some guy that fit that description came over, kissed her, made sure she was ok, then left. lol  Anyway, back to the no seats available, don't bother going upstairs unless you're on a mission of another kind.  It appears they don't give a rats ass about people that don't fork out the dough for the VIP section.  Of course a group of women that are of a very appealing nature, can arrange to get a table comped.  So if you don't get a table, expect to stand All night long.  I can think of something I'd like to do all night long,  standing is not one of them.  Watching how packed it got was quite amusing.  Especially if you want to meet someone, you don't have to worry about not being able to get close her, soon enough you'll find yourself right up in her,  space.  Yes, don't expect to be the only person occupying you own space.   Dance floor was even too small.  The place was so packed, the only dance option was Rave. No room for anything else.  Oh wait, did you say you have to go to the restroom? Good luck.  Push your way through the crowd. Then go up the stairs, turn right, go down the hall, make another right, then turn left, nope, that's not it...try again. lol.  In other words, restrooms are not easily accessible. 

* Lighting- Place was too dark.  Not conducive if you wanted to check out someone from a far.  Because what happens is, when they get close, they're far from good.  The light show for the night was very cool.  They did do a good job with the July 4th lighting theme.  

* Ventilation\/ a\/c- Not too hot, not to cold, was just right.  At least from where I was standing.  If you were standing in the inner portion of one of the outside lines under the ledge, moving around with the heard inside the club, in a long slow line waiting to order a drink, or on the dance floor, fogetaboutit. 

* Staff- Some were professional and knew what they were doing, others, well, you can fill in that blank.  I do have to make one note though, regarding the tall young lady with the iPad standing outside the club in the line area.  Very cold, an impersonal. Wtf crawled up... No reason whatsoever to interact with customers in that way.  

* Vibe- none.  Just your typical dance club. Didn't sense or feel anything that would compel me to return.  

- Even though the music, light show, and view were good, the no sitting, small dance floor, lack of the ability to move around, poor restroom accessibility, overly priced avg drinks, one epic fail iPad greeting girl, and no vibe or something unique that would separate this club from the rest, made this a 2 star club, based off my recent experience.

So, me and my friends got tickets to see Tiesto on Saturday we were so excited. We get inside the club (after waiting 1hr in a long a** line ) and we had to go through several flights of stairs to get to the main dance floor which had very little lighting, It was so dark that I ended tripped over and mind you I was sober, wearing flats. I started thinking about the girls who were wearing heels and were going up and down does stairs. I wonder how many injuries been reported from those stairs.  

Anyways, once we reached the dance floor we headed to the bar, my friend ordered his drink and was charged  $18 per drink and not even tall glass more juice than greygoose !!  ridiculously overpriced. 

In the dance floor we couldnt even dance this place was so over crowded people started pushing, elbowing and some even fighting so many out of control drunks with no security close by. I grew extremly concerned. 

After an hour in the crowd we couldnt take it anymore and we all decided to leave  find an empty space to just breath fresh air.  We couldnt find any . There were no exits!!! The exits were obstructed by the multitude of people, we couldnt get out of the maze of bodies. I became very anxious, i wanted nothing more than to leave i was so overwhelmed

As we were trying to make my way out I was harrassed, shoved, and punched, so were my friends.
One of my friends was asked if he had any drugs by this ratchet thirsty looking chick, wtf?!? 

security sucks i was pushed and yelled at by one of them when i asked him for assistance to get out.  I was so livid. Any remains of fun from earlier that day were stripped down at this place .

I saw Tiesto in my recent trip, and it probably was the best time I have had dancing to Tiesto!  He had great lighting and performers.

Make friends with a promoter or show up early with pre-sale tickets if you want to bypass the lines.  Get a table above the dance floor for the best view.",6,2,5

This place was so lame. The layout is absolutely terrible. It's a complete maze trying to find the other rooms. There are 2.5 levels (The top level is kind of a balcony level, which is absolutely pointless to go if you don't have a table since they line up the whole balcony.) 

The bottom floor (floor 3) is the hip-hop room. We thought it was Top 40, which would be SO fun, but it turned out to be ghetto hip-hop. It was way cramped and small (almost the size of Lavo). (To get downstairs, the stairs are just right of the elevators. Don't ask the bouncers, most of them are total douches..)

The main floor, floor 4, which is where you get off of the elevator, is where all of the unse unse music is. This place is meant for ballers with table service. There isn't much room elsewhere. The walkways are tight like Marquee, and I can only imagine how impossible it is to get from one place to another on a full night. I'm still traumatized by the night at Marquee with Kaskade, but that's for another review.

Even with a great girl-guy ratio, we had to buy tickets ($34 for the guys, $24 for the girls. Lame!!). One plus was that we didn't have to wait in line... Our other option was to be on the guest list, but they wanted PICTURES of the girls...we were like, what the hell?! I really don't like the vibe I get from this place. It was totally not worth the hype. We went to Tao the night before for free with no line either and had an absolute blast.",9,4,3

Like every club it's beautifully designed (aside from the fact that the stuff hanging from the ceiling obscures some of the lighting effects, but that's negligible).

Most people complain about the stairs but I'm going to complain about the layout and # of tables. Because seriously, unless you get a table, you're not going to get a glimpse of whoever is DJing unless you smash yourself up on the main dance floor. I would say this club is 90%  tables and 10% walking\/dancing space-- ridiculous. I'm used to the pushing and shoving and what not but seriously, it's never taken me a whopping 30 minutes to move 3 yards into the dance floor.

I'm sure I would have had a better time here if I got table service but I'll take my pushing\/shoving somewhere where I don't see tables every corner I turn.

 Went on 5\/5\/13 Cinco De Mayo to see Tiesto & the experience was Horrible from the beginning, a lot of ass hole bouncers that don't really know how to do their job right, a chubby short white bouncer was checking my ID ""California's Driver's license"" & he didn't ""THINK"" it was valid!! he tried to act all tough & smart ass in front of the ticket girls and he wanted to see another ID I didn't want to give him another ID because he didn't make any sense, he asked me to step outside & I asked him to get me his boss & then the manager let me in right away after he saw my ID  & he even asked the bouncer ""what's your problem"".
 
That was just the beginning, then going inside you have to go up the stairs for like 2 levels, I'm sure it's fun for everybody with a buzz specially girls with high heels, then inside the club it's a different story, the club is too small for all the advertising and DJ line up, those DJS deserve a better venue, no matter where you are you won't be able to see the DJ unless you made it to the dance floor through all the squished people, it's mostly made for bottle service tables all around the club, you can't stand anywhere to see whoever is spinning unless on the dance floor, the dance floor was super packed to the point that you can't move a muscle or dance & bouncers keep pushing people in to keep them off the bottle service tables!!  I couldn't stay on the dance floor for more than 5 mins then anywhere  I went there's a bouncer asking to keep walking, to where I didn't know, went to the second floor though it might be a better place to see Tiesto spinning from up there but it was also all surrounded with bottle service tables, also the second levels speakers weren't working!! so you only listen to the music playing on the main floor!!

I also had a cigar they asked me to put it out saying you can't smoke cigars but you can smoke cigarrettes!! I've never seen or heard about something like that any where in the world!! Even Tiesto when he got on the stage he didn't look happy at all, probably cause he got stuck with his residency there, without really knowing what is he getting himself to... I've been to Tiesto in different Venues in Vegas & LA & hes always smiling & in a good mood, the club was way too CROWDED for anybody to enjoy I guess even Tiesto himself.. couldn't stay there more than an hour & then me & my friends left...So far nothing beats XS & Marquee...I'd never go back to Hakkasan even if it's free!!

The second DJ reminded me of the clown on the Simpsons, really animated but not that great. Calvin Harris however, a real professional, he brought it, and his hit Summer was really the highlight.

My group of 11 was in Vegas for a bachelor party weekend, staying at the MGM Grand in the Marquee suite and a few other rooms. I swung by the Hakkassan desk in the lobby and the guy there helped me book a table for my group, $1,100 minimum spend, no cover, all good. He says to get there around 10:30-10:45 so he can get us a good table near the stage.

We rolled up at 10:45 and he came out to meet us, we waited in a few corral areas and were led to our table, which was basically the second-furthest table from the DJ. The table itself was smaller than my coffee table at home. A gorgeous girl met us to take my credit card and our orders, and we asked about moving to a closer table. She recommended that we ""get everything settled here"" and then they would check if we could move to one of the dozens of closer, empty tables. They did not check.

Two things really pissed me off: First, they wouldn't bring us water. Maybe I'm just cheap, but dropping $10 each for 8 oz. bottles of Fiji water, without the option to just get a pitcher or regular old water, is messed up. I'm going to spend $1,800 for the privilege of this coffee table in the corner all night, and tap water is too much to manage? Jesus.

Second, a few of us were trying to get down in the ""pit"" near the DJ booth. It's a hot mess, the bouncer is keeping some people out, letting some in, people are shoving past us and going right through, but the bouncer is doing his best. A guy shoves by me and I say ""dude we've been waiting here, come on."" He says ""I work here."" Lo and behold, it's the guy who helped me book the ""VIP"" table. Did not recognize me, did not give a shit about me or my friends.

Let's just say you can easily get lost here. There's mysterious elevators that take you from one level to the next. Totally confusing. 

Okay, so like I said, we came here for Calvin Harris. When he finally did show up in the EDM room...it was literally a mosh pit. That was a HUGE no thanks for me. I prefer to be able to shake my booty and wiggle wiggle myself without smashing my tatas or other body parts into other people or have them smash into me.

We ended up hanging out downstairs in the Hip Hop room the rest of the night at this VIP table full of super friendly doctors. If it wasn't for the ROOMY Hip Hop room, I probably would have given this nightclub a lower rating.

He brought back so many oldies but goodies. We arrived early and received free admission courtesy of our promoter which was great. We pretty much stuck to the hip hop floor and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. And while the drinks were expensive that wasn't unexpected.

Overall this place is pretty large and of course as the night went on it got more and more crowded, we left about 1:45am which I know is early so that's perhaps why the crowd was not overwhelming. And although we were shoo'ed off of one of the VIP ledges we were sitting on by security he was in no way rude about it. I would definitely go back.

Get there early or else you will not be able to dance.

the Hip hop room was spinning bay area jams all night which was hella awesome (SF\/Oakland represent!) with lots of shout outs and yay area love.  i personally enjoyed that and danced all night.  

went to the rave\/trance room later in the night since it was DJ Tiesto spinning. it was just fancy effects on the walls and strippers undressing each other and dancing on poles.  i could imagine it would be enjoyable for those who partake in the pill.  i personally was not impressed.  it quickly became a crowded moshpit sh**-show.  

basically had great fun in the hip hop room from 10pm - midnight.

But this time, Hardwell was playing and since this is my boyfriend's all-time favorite DJ. I figured it'd be a great experience to visit our first Vegas Nightclub.

It was the worst experience of our vacation.

Lines are so unorganized. We first lined up at the General Admission, but we had our tickets purchased Pre-Sale. The bouncers sent us to 3 different lines and wasted so much of our time waiting. When finally reaching the correct line, the lady in charge of this line said we had to ""Check-in our coats"". At first I thought it was ridiculous. But being stuck body to body, sweating ridiculously, I understand why now. (5$\/coat)

The place is aesthetically beautiful to look at. I thought we were in for a treat. 

As the night goes deeper,  the dance floor began flooding with people. Drunk, rude people. Pushing. 

There are multiple experiences. I'll keep it to the point and short. I was fixing my blouse and had accidentally touch a man's bottom. I apologized. I assumed he did not hear me through the loud music because he started interrogating me with his friends, and their girlfriends. Pushing into me. Calling me names. Grabbing me. I told the bouncers but they just seemed to smirk. Are they helping each other out ? My boyfriend thought it was just because of the crowded dance floor. But I remember faces if you're in my face the whole night !!

I also noticed my wristlet had been tugged on multiple times. I have a lock on it, and every time I felt that tug, that lock was removed. I checked my cards and cash. My debit card and cash was stolen. Wow. 

Later on into the night I noticed more girls started calling me names. I guess that man that I touched, that I apologized for, gather a gang of people to start hating me. 

I really wanted to leave but didn't want to ruin my boyfriend's night by not seeing Hardwell. So I stayed. 
Upon leaving the club, I noticed a scum pick pocketing guys. 

I REALLY wished I had a better experience but rude, unprofessional people and staff. Mind you, majority of whom who visited that night looked 30+. Ugh. 

Leaving the casino, I heard names being directed to me left and right all because of one jerk who thought I was trying to ""feel him up"". 

For me, 1 star. Worst club ever. I am never coming back. But this is my review to another.

If you do plan on visiting, I recommend:
1) Wear flashy flats or small heels if possible. Or bring a pair to wear before and after all that dancing and standing - no place to sit)

2) Honestlly, if my lock got broken multiple times, clip it to your bra or make sure you're covering the access to the opening with your hand.

3) Don't bother with drinks. It's completely water down. I'd just spend your money on water. Even though it's small as hell.

4) Bring pepper spray for guys harassing you.",17,11,5

Just like Omnia, crowded but better because I was at least able to dance. Was able to move. 

Music on the main floor was great because it was Calvin Haris.

Anyway, being the much more mature lady that I am, I got to see the entire club this time and it's GINORMOUS. None of which is really pretty or eye-catching. I remember a bunch of trellis-like structures forming a square that we kept circumnavigating.

But the BF wanted to check out the ""hot new Vegas club"" so we got a table for our party of six. Despite my slight disdain for clubs, I enjoyed Hakkasan enough to give this place 4 stars.

Perks worth mentioning:
- They treat you pretty well if you're willing to shell out the $3K for table service.
- We didn't have to wait in line at all since we got table service.
- Our table service included 4 bottles of liquor, 6 mixers, 6 red bulls, and 6 bottles of water.
- There are hidden drawers underneath the seats at the table service areas so you can store purses, jackets, etc.
- The hidden drawers contain phone chargers.
- Staff was constantly checking our table for empty glasses to take away and wipe up any spills in our general area.
- There was never EVER a line for the ladies room and it was always clean.
- Tommy Trash was spinning and the music was pretty awesome!
- The table service areas are pretty spacious and it never got too crowded. Lots of dancing room for us!
- At some point of the night when the crowd was getting thinner, our party got transfered to a better table closer to the main dance floor. SCORE!

One strange gripe during the night was that one of the bouncers made me stop dancing with my BF who was sitting down. It wasn't like I was being inappropriate or lap dance-y or anything. So I'm not sure why he made me stop. Is my dancing THAT bad!?! Other than that bouncer guy, the rest of the staff was pretty nice and awesome to us. Very rare to find such friendly service at a club.

We partied until they kicked us out sometime close to 4am. Even though we didn't venture every floor of this multi-leveled club, we had a good time! Maybe it was good that we stuck to the one floor though...I heard that there are lots and lots of stairs. No thank you to that! I like to wear heels to clubs ;)",8,6,5

The club is definitely nice, and the djs great but the SERVICE was HORRIBLE. I have never been to a club were the security and attendants were so rude. 
My friends and I were able to get a table from a promoter which was awesome at first. Because we were getting a table were told we had to be there by 10 (about 4 hours before Calvin Harris went on)
After standing in various lines and multiple check ins we finally got in the club - and to the table. However 20min in a security guy came up and told us that the 2 guys who were with us (12 girls) who had just paid $100 each were not allowed to sit at our table... I saw another group being told the same thing, unless you specifically paid for your table, guys were not allowed, which made no sense.

30 min before Calvin Harris came on, another security guy and another man with a clipboard came up to our table flashing flash lights and demanding we leave - we were not allowed to sit at the table and had to move - they were yelling at us continuously telling us to move with absolutely no explanation as to why. After arguing with the man and demanding he at least tell us why we had to go - he told us an owners friend had bought out the table and he had to give it them 'or else he's lose his f******* job"" as though it was out fault. 

I know that this is not unusual in clubs, to be asked to leave a free table (given by promoters) when someone who can afford to buy it comes along- but the workers their were SO RUDE about it, as though we had snuck into the table and stole their alcohol.

After leaving the table we went down into the crowd which was so crowded my friends and I were literally stuck in the same position for 10 min, absolutely unable to move, at the same time the bottle service attendants are shoving you from behind - I remember asking one of them, who was carrrying a large stack of cups to a table to ""not push me"" to which he responded he'll ""push me if he has to"" and then did. 

Another friend was repeatedly yelled at and threatened to be kicked out because she was leaning against a surface close and kinda connected to the tables - her back was turned to the Dj and crowd and it was clear she just needed somewhere to sit for bit

In addition, water bottles (8oz fuji waters) were $8 dollars each, a redbull was $9 - As they made us get their 4 hours early because we ""had a table"" we all sobered up pretty fast - which meant you had to spend I cant imagine how much on drink from the bar.. which costs a lot!

Overall, I would never go back here -  The club itself was definitely cool, but the workers there all seem to be on power highs from working in the ""hottest"" club in vegas, its just not worth it - I have been to Las Vegas multiple times and to a lot of different clubs but have never experienced such arrogant and pretentious servers and security. - they literally ruined our night

I would recommend Surrender, XS, or any of other clubs! They're cheaper, less crowded, still have great djs and actually treat you like customers not uninvited guests.

Security is an absolute joke - after reading the reviews of others who've had their personal effects stolen and notified security, I'm starting to think that the security has ties with the people stealing things. They might be getting a cut of the profits so they don't care to do anything about the fact there are people stealing other peoples' things in their club.

The dance floor is PACKED and it's a huge fire hazard. The DJs don't come on until 2am or later, and the crowd is filled with disgusting douchebags and drunk people who will fall or vomit on top of you because they can't even stand up straight. Having people fall on, step on, and elbow you in a crowd that's already packed tighter than a can of sardines is NOT fun. There's nowhere to sit, I could barely breathe it was so packed.

They don't provide tap water, so you will need to purchase $9 mini bottles of Fuji water. Drinks are even more expensive and watered down.

Summary: This place is HORRIBLE on every level except the music and lights.

First of all they LET WAY TOO MANY PEOPLE IN, and I am going by vegas standards.  YOU CANNOT MOVE after 12.  There are two dance floors or maybe I should call them ""stand floors.""  I mean most clubs get overcrowded but this one takes the cake.

Second of all the bouncers are THE WORST.  I mean they won't even let you stand in one place if its ANYWHERE NEAR a walkway.  Did I mention that everything is a walkway if its not a dance floor?  So where am I supposed to go? That pool of people on the dance floor where I will get trapped forever?  Oh wait, I can't because the bouncer already blocked the main entrance to the floor. . . because its too crowded . . . So I guess I have to just constantly scoot around shoulder to shoulder with hundreds of people.  

Third, this venue is way overpriced for how small and maze-like it is, marquee and XS are so much more open and there are actually places to chill and relax, talk, or dance at those other venues.

Only consolation is that music,  lights and special effects are good but nothing special compared to the other big clubs in vegas.  . . .

We thought that visiting the night with Tiesto performing would be a big night for both of us to have fun while drinking but we were wrong. The night started with little bit of people entering the dance store but as it got late more people started entering. Dance floor started getting packed you couldnt even dance anymore. People with there drinks in there hands would start spilling on you or leaving the glass on the floor where people would start kicking it everywhere. You have security everywhere but all they were doing was being rude as f**k you couldnt even stand near a booth because you werent part of it. Nowhere to walk without bumping into someone spilling on you. We left after 2 hours and half pass because you had nowhere to grove anymore. When we got outside hakassan they were still letting people get inside. I was suprised because I thought they would of stop because on how SMALL there dance floor were. But me and my girlfriend were glad we left, couldnt take on how terrible it was inside. 

As for the main dj I heard they dont perform until late at night like around 2ish to 230. We didnt stay that long because we got tired of people bumping into you or accidentally hitting you or stepping on you. I literally wanted to dead leg someone because they were that close into me. So we left around 1230 and we were unimpressed because we came to see Tiesto perform and we didnt. But Samtrack (whatever the girl name is) and this other dude who peform after were great but still have to give thie review a 1 star.

Fix your dance floor, hire people who arent dicks.I know they are supposed to be mean but when you have nowhere to moved then its understandable. Keep your dance floor under control as well. Also have your main Dj start playing a little early and maybe next time I come visit again I would give this club another try if not I rather go somewhere else thats better then Hakkasan !!

Usually have a decent line up of DJ's, I highly recommend buying tickets in advance as it pretty much gives you VIP admittance so that hassle of waiting in line won't apply to you.

I had a lot of fun dancing in the Ling Ling club area which was more hip hop.

DJ Tiesto was amazing for Halloween and with the way the venue is set up it feels more like a private show then being at a huge place where you can barely even see the performer. Awesome light sequences, music and talent provided. 

Ladies- in the restroom there are attendants who can help with things such as tampons, hairspray, even to go flats for hurting feet. 

Lots of stairs so ladies might want to wear shoes they can walk in, on top of this there is almost no where to sit unless you have a VIP section somewhere. 

The concert area on level 4 for EDM shows gets way too packed and people start getting aggressive, not personally my thing, but it does come with the scene. 

Be ready to spend some money or hope you get hit on and hope that person wants to buy you drinks bc one is $16...and it's small. $9 for a Fuji water bottle that's smaller than average size of course.

After numerous failed attempts at clubbing here, I finally got the chance to club at Hakkasan Easter weekend 2015 after close to two years of trying to make it here.  I do not recall ever hearing anyone say one good thing about Hakkasan besides the awesome dj's that they pull.  It could not be all bad right?  Well when everyone you know and everyone they know and Yelp reviewers on average hate it (2.5 stars and close to 1000 reviews....that's a pretty bad average), that is when you cannot deny it is bad.  However despite that, I still wanted to go and check it out.  I am glad I did, now I can say I went and it was really not that great.  

We were lucky enough to get a table so we took the elevator up to the club and down when we were leaving the club.  The only time I had to deal with the stairs was when we decided to hit up the Ling Ling room.  I kind of wished we had stayed in the Ling Ling room longer because I personally think hip hop clubs are way more entertaining.  People watching at hip hop clubs is so amusing.  The Ling Ling room reminded me of old Drais, dark and sectioned off.  The tables have a drawer underneath the seats where you can store your stuff and they have phone chargers in there too.  I thought that was pretty cool.

Hakkasan's entrance reminds me so much of Marquee, when you exit the elevators you are greeted with a dark interior, crowds and loud music.  From what I saw there were two bars, one towards the entrance and the other towards the side of the stage.  The stage background was any typical club stage, elevated with huge screens behind it flashing various images and phrases.  The one thing I do remember about Hakkasans stage was that the Monitors for the background had a weird, creepy image of s girl in like a jester hat with what looked like venoms mouth and long tongue.  It was very weird.  Oh and it was freezing in there, holy crap turn down the air when the club is not so packed.  I was shivering.  The dance floor is so minuscule...like ridiculously minuscule to the point where you are packed like sardines.

It is safe to say that Hakkasan is one of those clubs where you need to have bottle service to have fun because the dance floor is so small.  I feel like Hakkasan is getting less and less popular every year, I mean now with the introduction of Omnia at Caesars palace which has a somewhat similar layout as Hakkasan but it is so much better, see my review for Omnia for why it is better, Hakkasan seriously needs to step up its game.  When I tried going to Hakkasan two years ago, the guest list line for Hakkasan wrapped around and around and out the door.  Granted it was for Calvin Harris but W&W were there when I went and they are a pretty good and popular Dj but Hakkasan failed to draw a good crowd.  Everyone was commenting that it was not as crowded as it used to be.  I guess all the negative word of mouth and reviews finally are starting to affect its ratio of club-goers, either that or I came on an off night.  Bathrooms are relatively clean and well monitored.  Nothing really stood out in there, typical club bathrooms, dark but at least there were a bunch of stalls so you never have to wait that long.  

Even though, most of the people in my group still were not fans and would probably not go again.  I mean it just was not fun, there was nothing really about it that stood out from all the other massive clubs in Vegas.  It was not exceptionally eye-pleasing, nor was it super huge, nor did it have a great crowd.  I would say, maybe check it out if there is a Dj that you really want to see there, but personally I do not think I would want to go back.",3,2,2

First, the good.  There is a lounge, two dancing areas (one much larger than the other), an upstairs chilling area, and a gazillion bars.  I was afraid the bars would get backed up with all the people we had, but they never did.  I never had to wait to get a drink (and it was open bar).  That was amazing.

The different areas made it nice to spread out.  You could find a quieter place (definitely not quiet, so it is all relative with other areas in the club) to talk or you can dance wildly on the floor.  I saw people start to dance in the lounge area too.  Not a lot, but there were a couple brave souls.

The other great thing is you can have a buffet in here.  When I first got there, the conference had a buffet spread on the dance floor and in a ton of the sitting areas.  Even though I didn't eat, I thought it was pretty cool.  

They also had an acrobat act, dancers in lights, and a hula hoop artist.  They let us dance on the elevated platforms.  The cautious person in me thought, oh geez this is an accident waiting to happen, but everything was fine and it added to the fun.  

So the one bad, it was crazy crowded on the main dance floor.  Like, not able to turn around crowded.  This might have been our fault for all wanting to be on the main dance floor, but they should have regulated that.  There were too many people to really enjoy dancing.  

I can't say I know what a normal night here is like, but if you are having a conference, I'd definitely suggest renting this place out.",0,0,0

apparently I harassed the bouncer... just a teeeeeensy bit that night... 

""excuse me, what's your name again? i'll have you know that I'm an elite yelper"" - alright so i fibbed a little bit but hey... i was once an elite and i plan on applying again for the new year ;) anyways, i told the bouncer I'd be sure to write up a review for this club and no no...it wasn't gonna be pretty. 

don't mess... with an active yelper. ohkay?! 

important stuff: 
- just don't go here. 
- go to light. go to xs. go surrender. anywhere... ANYWHERE else but here. 
- bouncers are constantly trying to kick people out -__- so have fun, but put that sober face on when one of those buzz killers walk by. 
- bouncers at the door are stupid. don't waste your flirting energy on them.
- hold on to your belongings, apparently it's a normal thing for people to get their stuff stolen from their pockets, purses, etc.. one occurrence is just bad luck but it sounds like others experienced similar happenings at this club... soooo, yeah... SHADY much??! 
- the main DJ's come on around 1am and after... making us girls have to arrive before 10:30pm for a phoney ""guest list"" line and the making us pay $30... can you please tell me WHO the heck wants to wait until 1am for some DJ to come on, when guys here are having to pay 80+ a person and girls are having to pay... any money, period for this shiz. -_- you'd think these DJ's could actually work for the money they're getting paid...

so here's how it went down. it's Labor Day weekend and sweeeeet, girlfriend got us onto guestlist for free! ........NOT!  don't fall for their ""guestlist"" shiz. it's a total scam. they tell you you're on guestlist, u wait in a long line, and then last minute at the door they tell you there's no guestlist for that night and cover is $30. excuseeeeeeme?! i don't mind paying a cover, honestly i was pretty surprised to hear there wasn't a cover for that weekend. low and behold, they pull one of their dirty little tricks and i had to waste $30 for a night at this lame club. if you're going to charge a cover, then let us know straight out. shady business = me writing a really bad review for your club and then telling all of my friends and friends of friends to never come party here. 

and like i mentioned above, a friend of ours got his wallet stolen while on the dance floor... we thought it might have just been bad luck for him, but after reading other reviews...sounds like this is something that happens quite often at this club... interesting...... 

honestly i'm not a huge fan of edm, i miss the old hip hop clubbing days... so i basically only go to vegas clubs when my friends ask me to come along... with that being said, when i end up having to pay for this kind of stuff... and then end up having to wait hours for some dj person to come play some music you can't even dance to... yeah. i get kind of unhappy. and then i write up a 1 star review like this... when you see all these other elite yelpers writing up 1 star reviews... you KNOW this place ...sucks.",11,15,7

Given how overly crammed in we were, she could have been trampled, but not one person there gave a damn. Bartender was a complete a-hole and when I finally got my bill for the watered down cranberry vodka, whiskey coke, and two teeny tequila shots, it was $75. $10 for bottled water, which they claim is all they have.

The last time I was in Vegas I did return to see DJ Fergie. We were promised VIP entrance and drink tickets.  The director of services, Rebeccah,  was suppose to be our contact. She emailed us her phone number, but would never return our calls or texts. 

I finally showed the emails to the security personnel, and he let us in the VIP entrance. He told us Rebeccah was off that day. Thank goodness the security guy took the time to listen to my question, and actually looked at the email I had showed him. 

We had a better experience then the first time, but the communication between the staff is still off. 

Pros:
Drinks are still great. 
The bartenders are very personable. 
The security on the outside that helped us was very nice, and willing to help. 
DJ Fergie is great. 
The other areas of the club are nice and spacious. 

Cons:

I told him that I wasn't and he continued to tell me to get some water. I told him that I didn't need any and told him to go away. The security guard he was working with even told him to leave me alone. And yet he watched my every move, until I walked to another part of the club. 
 Any how, I was really excited to come here until that experience. I'm very disappointed with the organization of the club and inability to get around without being harassed by security guards named Brice. I will be sticking to less newer clubs in Vegas for now on.

I liked that they had room playing hip hop, although the dance floor is small and gets crowded quickly. However, you can get some elevation by dancing on the platform areas in between some of the booths (if you're a lady..)- they have stairs on the side to get up and down. The worst parts about Hakkasan are that you're packed in like a sardine on the dance floors, it takes forever to get an overpriced drink, and the horrible cement stairs- it's almost two flights to get from the hip hop room to the EDM room! Your feet will be killing you long before the end of the night. Take advantage of the elevator if you can.. 

I would highly recommend getting a booth if possible so you have a place to sit and escape the crowds, although that will cost $$ as well.

I came here Thursday 27th August to see tiesto play. 
I don't know what the issue is with people saying it took ages to get in but I can only review my experience. Two girls, my friend and I, we arrived there 10:30pm and we were stamped, inside and had a drink in our hand within 5 minutes.
I read reviews about the plethora of stairs before I visited this nightclub. Get a grip people! It's a few flights and yes before you ask I was wearing 6 inch heels!! I sped past people on the stairs who were walking up them like they were climbing Mount Everest and one guy even asked me - how do these stairs not affect you.. One word.. Gym. 

Hakkasan is a very small nightclub that consists of 75% tables and very little space to stand. For the first two hours as the nightclub got busier and busier my friend and I were not enjoying feeling so claustrophobic. Luckily we made friends with some kind people who had an amazing table. If we hadn't of found a table to join we would have gone home before tiesto came on, it gets unhealthily crowded and the security shout at people to keep the walkways clear. If you have a table or befriend people with a table you will have one of the best nights of your life, especially if a big headliner is on! This nightclub really doesn't cater to the general public unfortunately and it's very obvious that it's aimed only at people who want to purchase tables.
Luckily for me this was one of the best nights out I've ever been on, tiesto high fived my friend and I and gave us a shot :-)

Hakkasan is one of those cases when I've learned to trust my apprehensive instinct of not going to this kind of places instead of paying an extra amount of money to check it out of curiosity.  For it's price, it's an extremely over hyped club that requires you to spend quite a bit of money in order to truly have 'fun'. First off, for so many stairs to walk around, I understand why there are absolutely NO places to sit down\/rest (unless you have table service) Even when my friends and I managed to find an area to chill or to take off our heels, there are guards on your case to wear your shoes and back on the dance floor... Really? 
Despite all the electronic music up on the main floor, I actually enjoyed being down at the hip hop room but did not appreciate the trek going up and down the stairs..

Despite the guards telling you to stand up, most of them were pretty nice and welcoming when we entered in the club. 

Word of advice for girls: Unless you have table service, be sure to have an extra pair of flats to wear because taking off your heels to rest your feet will not cut it! Better yet, go somewhere else..like Marquee or Light to satisfy your clubbing experience!

Word of advice for guys: Take a moment to SERIOUSLY consider whether it's worth your money to pay nearly $100 to get in, for a DJ that's probably over-hyped at this point.",10,1,1

I went on a Sunday for Tiesto and then the following Thursday for Bingo Players. Both had awesome sets if you are into that, but towards the end of the night during Bingo Players, I noticed my clutch was a bit lighter. Since there are so many people on this dancefloor, someone unzipped my purse and snatched my phone and I was none the wiser. 

Of the disorienting nightclubs in Las Vegas, I have to say that this one wins the award for most intentionally confusing. There are only about 500 stairs in the whole building, making all the levels and stories so confusing that you have to utilize all your spatial recognition skills that you learned about in Psych 101.

I would say if you want to go here be very cautious. We all had our purses zipped, clasped, secure, etc. 

I'm under the impression Hakkasan is only able to set itself apart amongst its competitors with their headliners like Tiesto and Calvin Harris (Tiesto was great that night). The venue itself is nothing special, I had higher expectations. The photos do not represent the club accurately in any way. It's your typical Vegas nightclub that treats you like a herd of animals. If I went again it would only be to see Tiesto again but I also like having my valuables safe in my clasped purse where they belong...not being pick pocketed by professionals.

Pros:

- If you're living on south end, no need to taxi to Wynn\/Encore


Cons:
- Competition with Light Nightclub which I feel is a better club
- Crowded and isn't really fun unless you get bottle service and even then you might not get a direct view of the stage

I was standing by the bar next to my boyfriend and I had rested my head on his shoulder area.  I was hugging him too - it was literally the stance of most couples when girls just want to rest their head on their guys. Literally 30 seconds after I did that, we got a tap on our shoulder saying that we had to go. WTF? Not wanting to cause a scene, we followed this bouncer to the door and he asked for my driver's license - so I gave it to him.  He then took my ID, wrote down my entire information, then gave that piece of paper to the bouncers at the entrance so that I couldn't back in ... since there's only one entry way into the club. 

First of all, can I just ask why I was kicked out?  I was perfectly fine - and the bouncer must've known since he asked ME for my ID, looked ME in the eye, gave ME BACK my own ID and watched me walk off perfectly fine. Now, I'm not going to lie and say that I was sober, but I was DEFINITELY not drunk to the point where it's obvious that I need to be kicked out. 

Secondly, if you bouncers are going to be strict, don't be looking around the bar for people to kick out. Because guess what?  My friend YACKED in the MIDDLE of the dance floor. Did he get kicked out? No. And I was kicked out for resting my head on my boyfriend's shoulder?  I wasn't stumbling, I wasn't all over the place. and I wasn't even near yacking or looking like I needed to. 

This club is ridiculous. 
I had SUCH high expectations and I've given this club a second chance that it COMPLETELY ruined - on my birthday weekend too. 

The only good part? The promoter was nice and got us girls in fast.  But after that - downhill. I will avoid this club at ALL costs.  And I suggest you guys do the same -  it's NOT worth it. At all.

A tip for you folks is to not be on the main stage at that time but stand around the bar or wherever you see railings or open spaces near the raised tables.  Before he gets on, the bouncers may not let you stand there but once he does, they'll be more lenient.  

Downstairs is the hip-hop floor where you will find less bouncy, EDM type of dancing  and more disgusting, bedroom-only type of dancing.",6,11,4

Getting into the club was a bit of a hassle - lots of check points and checking tickets, ids, etc. Once inside we got up to the dance floor and had a blast! They had a good opening DJ and it was fun dancing. HOWEVER, this place proceeded to be packed with people as the night went on, and made it nearly impossible to dance. There are too many VIP tables down in the main room, and security keeps pushing you back into the mob, so, it gets really uncomfortable, so we had to go upstairs. When you're upstairs there isn't any way to see the stage unless you're in a VIP table, which we were eventually invited into, but had to leave due to the company. 

Overall, they get great acts here, but they need to work on population control or get rid of some of the VIP tables.",0,0,0

Walked in and left within 15 mins. Felt claustrophobic inside with no ventilation like you were in a smoke filled cave and there was no way out. 5 floors but it got smaller and smaller as you walked up\/down.

Depending on the event at the hotel, the place will conform. If it's a fight weekend expect to see ghetto ass people and rowdy people. The place was jam packed and not nice as the other clubs. We went on a fight weekend and the place was filthy, dirty, and gross. Lots of ghetto people (and cheap!) Not a place you want to be at. After the fight we heard many fights broke out (luckily we were at XS! Woot!)

Also, they don't do specials like other clubs like girls free drink from 10-11 or 2 free drink coupons, and they don't even serve water, you have to BUY a small small Fuji water for $9. No water in a regular glass? That sounds like a bad situation since that will lead to over consumption and by over drinking you get a rowdy crowd and then John Taffer will come and yell at you for letting your guest over drink. I know they want to make money, but with the expensive drinks, is a cup of water that hard to ask for? What if you're friend is totally wasted and that cup of water will save her life, and you just wasted all your money buying their expensive drink. Other clubs will provide you like a plastic cup of water, nope not Hakkasan because they want you to be drunk and rowdy, ghetto and get into fights. I guess it's publicity for them.

Of course it was dead and no one was dancing. We were the first ones on the dance floor lol. After we got on the dance floor, people started to follow and dance as well. 

We went to the hip-hop room and mainly stayed there for the rest of the night because of the music. It's small. After an hour later, the room was filled up and crowded. It got pushy on the dance floor. My girl friends & I got up on one of those mini stage platform in between booths. No one really dares to get up on those platforms and dance in front of hundreds of people. I was embarassed but what the heck...it's Vegas. There was space to move around and dance. Just don't get too drunk or else you will fall off. It didn't happen but just be careful.

We saw the last bit of Steve Aoki performance. This was my 3rd time seeing him and I wouldn't consider myself a groupie. Steve and I just happen to be at the same place at the same time! Lol! His sets are always over the top. Jumping into rafts and crowd surfing, throwing sheets of cake into the crowd for ""cake in the face,"" and champaign showers. He had some awesome neon lights with the outline of his head hanging from the ceiling which were really dope. He also came out for one last appearance and waved a flag with his profile on it. I never get tired of seeing him perform.

We did pre-sale tickets for Deadmau5 unleashed on a Friday night. We arrived around midnight and went from line to line to line, but they moved pretty quickly. We were inside within 15 minutes.

What you read about the Hakkastairs is true, but for us guys it wasn't any big deal. I guess I could see why girls in 3 inch heels complain, but it wasn't a problem for us. You can take the elevator, but we didn't care to wait.

The first floor we arrived on was a hip-hop floor. Not really my scene (though we did have a celebrity sighting). We continued upward. That's where the party was at.

The opener DJ was world class. He did an amazing job pumping up the crowd for the main act. Deadmau5 came on around 2:00am, and didn't disappoint. The sound system is pounding (I was glad to have ear plugs), the lights and video were awesome, the kryo was awesome.

My only complaint was that the main floor was so crowded. I was trapped for a while and couldn't move. I am not a fighter, but I was ready to punch a guy who kept bumping into me. If it were not for the place being so packed and the abundance of douchey people, Hakkasan would have gotten a rare 5 stars from me.

No directions on where the line bgeins since there are about 15 different lines, no signs either. Had to ask someone who worked there he pointed and said he ""thinks its over there"". We go to that line wait about 20 minutes, get stamped. Then proceed to ANOTHER line to show our tickets, wait another 20 minutes get stamped again, finally make our way into the club. Stairs on stairs on stairs. I cant imagine how many drunk people fall down these. Walk up the stairs and come to a halt, there is yet ANOTHER line of people just trying to cram into the club. Thinking maybe it's just crammed because its a small hallway and people are waiting to get in, there would be more room once we got inside the actual club. Boy was I wrong. Some people were literally looking in, seeing how they stuff people wall to wall in this place and saying ""I cant do this"". The club was just as crammed if not more crammed than the hallway. Had to inch my way through a massive crowd. If you like to invade people's personal spaces and rub up on them just to be able to move around then this is the club for you! It was awful. Could barely see anything yet alone move. I'm not claustrophobic but Hakkasan was soon turning me that way. After about 10 minutes my friends and I decided to GTFO. Go down a hall that claims ""exit"" in huge red letters, soon as we make our way down there through the mobs of people a woman says we cannot exit that way and that we have to go back through the mobs to get out. I asked her if I could pay her to leave that way, I was half joking that's how desperate I was. We made our way through the crowd and down the numerous flights of stairs. I knew I should've believed the bad reviews on here for this place but I was naive. I learned my lesson and will let everyone know NOT to get trapped in the same mess I was.

The floors are very slick, so if you're wearing high heels or\/and if the floor has alcohol on it, you're going to slip. The club is very confusing and it's very easy to get separated from people as there are a million people, several bars and many different floors. The main club level is smaller than some other Vegas clubs and there are far too many people squeezed in. You seriously can't even walk to the bar. We left early because we were so miserable. 

The drinks are expensive and not worth it, or strong enough. I also had a drink get stolen from me because of how crowded it is. My friend got her wallet stolen off of her, and was told it happens a lot at this club because of how many people are crammed in such a small place. 

I'm convinced they have paid these great DJ's a ton of money to have residencies there, because there is no way anyone would ever go to this awful club without the big names.

My friend and I (in unison): Hey, let's go to Hakkasan!
Me (Suddenly worried): But what about the bad reviews?
Friend: Nah, they are all related to people having trouble getting in.
Me: Yeah, we won't have those issues! We know a host! 

The host surprisingly tells us to get there late, so we follow his advice and get there way past 12. There is a ticket admission line on one side, and guest list and ladies lines on the other. So first, we are in the guest list area- not line, because at that point, rules don't apply and it's everyone for themselves, pushing up front , trying to unsuccessfully catch someone's attention. When that doesn't go anywhere, we move to the ladies' ""line""- but it makes no difference. Everyone is on the guest list, and almost everyone  is a lady, because in my 1.5 hours of waiting, I saw 1.5 guys, on average, get in. But more on that later...

We see the host that we know, who tells us that he will get us in in a minute, but right now no one is getting in , they are over capacity, etc. etc.. I hear other hosts tell other girls the same thing, and that it could be anywhere from 15-50 minutes to get in. But once in a while, I see only certain hosts get people in. It is too late in the night to form conspiracy theories and analyze this hierarchy, so we just keep waiting. A long while passes when some hosts start changing their stories and telling people that they might as well leave because they are not getting in. Our host comes out of hiding and we just ask him to honestly tell us if we are getting in and he assures us that we are, it will just be a few more minutes. 

Meanwhile, we decide to go into a bar adjacent to Hakkasan. When you come out of the bar, it just so happens that you are in an area where all the hosts hang out, getting closer access. At that point, the story still stays the same- to get in is anywhere 15-50 minutes. Who gets in, we ask? People who are meeting people with tables, seems to be a general response. Mysteriously, those people are mostly girls, with a few guys sprinkled in between.  A group of girls who was waiting for a long time goes in with a host whom I've seen getting others in. So we talk to him. Same story, 15-50 minutes. What about those girls who just got in, we ask? They are friends of Calvin Harris, the host says. I doubt any real friends of Calvin Harris will be waiting in line for an hour, but OK, whatever.  We finally got in after talking to yet another host, not the one we knew, who at that point had disappeared. BUT what really made this whole experience unpleasant was the constant lack of clear answers.  If we're not getting in, just TELL US!!  We appreciate honestly so we can go on with our night. Yes, your strategy is to keep people outside to make your club seem like it's the hottest place on earth, but I don't want to be the puppet outside making the club look good while wasting my precious time not knowing what's going to happen. This lack of disrespect and disregard really threw me off. 

However, once Inside, the energy was amazing, The sound quality, the lights, the visuals were all great. No line at the bar, very nice bartenders making very nice, strong drinks. The stairs are not too bad, but maybe it's because I was semi-sober. Maybe the drinks weren't that strong after all. Anyway, It was all almost worth the waiting, Almost. 

Next time, if I want to see a DJ, I will just buy the online tickets. Seems like that is the way to get in without a hassle.",8,2,1

Hakkasan is the home to a a large mix of  A list of resident DJ's like Calvin Harris, Steve Aoki, Bob Sinclair, R3hab, Hardwell, Tommy Trash, and Tiesto just to name a few. You can see all your favorites spin at the same club! Awesome! Even more of a plus if you're staying at MGM! Since I always have the same few stops whenever I hit up Vegas, I was excited that this could be in my mix of clubs to hit up whenever I'm in town. 

Hakkasan is without a doubt a beautiful night club. They have amazing light displays and the sound system is really awesome. There are two levels to Hakkasan however, it was really crowded when I came for Hardwell the Thursday before EDC weekend. The lines were ridiculous to get in, so thankfully my friend and I had tickets pre-bought online. Our line was short and sweet- we got in in record time. The prices went up that night for sure and guys always pay more than girls if you get at the door. If you already know you want to come and it's a big night, always try to pre-buy online.

Once inside, you'll notice there are a lot of stairs. There also isn't a lot of space for the dance floor but there is ample seating if you get bottle\/ table service. They are a few bars located around the club so you can get drinks from various points in the club. Overall the experience was only okay. I wanted to like Hakkasan more than I did. It is a really nice, new club but it was just so crowded with people and stairs that we didn't get to watch the rest of Nervo's set.

Came here opening weekend (4\/27\/13) to see Calvin Harris. My group was 5 girls total and we were on a guestlist and were told that our entry would be free. We arrived around 10:15 and pointed to the guestlist line which was so long it was out the door and around the corner of the hotel outside. My group waited a total of 2.5 hours to get inside and once we did we were told at the payment windows that they had ""just changed the rules for the guestlist a few minutes ago"" and now it was $20 for girls and $200 for guys. Are you kidding me? I know it was opening weekend and they were busy, but trying to milk it the way they did was ridiculous.

The only reason I'm giving the extra star is for the awesome female host (I wish I could remember her name, she was blonde and had her hair in a top-bun) that was understanding of our situation and helped us out by giving us a different guestlist entry slip that allowed us to all get in free like we were supposed to originally. She was incredibly nice to do that for us and was one of the few kind staff members we encountered in Vegas all weekend.

Inside:
We walked inside right as Calvin Harris started his set and tried to make our way to the dance floor. The place was so packed that they had blocked off the dance floor so that no one else was allowed in. Whatever, that happens with popular DJs, but there was literally NO WHERE else to stand. Anywhere we stopped, we were motioned by bouncers to keep moving.

We decided to try going upstairs to the upper level to see if we had more luck up there so we went to the elevators to go up and were told that the elevators were for ""VIP use only"". Wtf? Okay, so after about 10 minutes, we locate where the stairs are and go up. It was considerably more roomy up there, but there were so many tables (most of them empty) that there was NO WHERE to stand to see the stage. Once more people started making their way up there, we were again told that we couldn't stand behind the bottle service tables. We ended up doing laps around the club! It was ridiculous!

All in all we probably only spent 30 minutes there because we were so miserable. Not even Calvin Harris's great set could keep us there longer. Maybe in a few weeks when the hype dies down and there isn't so many people it might be better, but it did not leave a good first impression and getting my friends to ever go back is going to be impossible.

Pros: Not many. Good DJ's and the one great staff member we spoke to.

Cons: Too many stairs, horrible use of space, way too many bottle service tables (most of which were not even in use) allowing no where to stand if you didn't drop 10k on a table, skeezy practices when it came to charging people who were told they were getting in free, etc, etc. I will most likely not be going back any time soon.",1,1,0

Yes, the bars are very nice looking, and the staff are very nice and very welcoming. Once again, I highly recommend you get a table if you want a place to sit and not get stuff on your clothes.

Will never to back and the only redeeming quality about this place is Calvin Harris.  First off this place is hideous.  For a few hundred million and $100 cover I was expecting extravagance not  an unimaginative, lackluster econolodge.  Second, this place has serious design flaws.  There is nowhere to stand around the club and listen to music or watch the LCD stage show except a tiny super crowded dance floor.  Don't come here without a table because there is no place there for you to be.  Third, they let way too many people in and its very crowded and you wont be able to dance or move on the floor during peak hours.  Don't come here.

You really don't think girls who travel miles, out of the country even, to Las Vegas is going to like a venue with 8 flights of stairs, do you? You don't think they're going to want to wear flats instead of heels just to accommodate this club, do you?  If you're a smart girl like me, you'll bring to-go flats to switch in the night. BUT, that's unfair to the girls who can't or don't bring them.

PROS:
- Some of the best DJ lineups
- REALLY good lighting in the main room
- Extremely good sound system, probably the best 
- Good ventilation
- 2 rooms: One main edm\/house room and one smaller hip hop room that played some good hip hop music 

CONS:
- No in and outs
- No place to sit, won't let girls sit on the side of the booths.  Ugh, excuse me security guard, do you want to try wearing these heels for the next 5 hours & dancing??
- Stairs everywhere = DANGEROUS for drunk people.  Only people with bottle service are allowed to use the elevators, which are a minimum of $6,000.
- No outside

So maybe it's a good place for another EDC or rave, but for drunkies, beware.  I saw a guy miss a step and fall and spill his drink.  He was so embarrassed. But sir, you shouldn't be. If I didn't leave the club early from being over the club, I'm sure there would have been a lot more falls from Stairkkasan.",13,14,2

Although they have 2 rooms (hip hop on bottom and edm on top), it is still not enough to fit the amount of people who are here to see these world renowned DJ's.

In Vegas for a friend's 40th, I was taken here against my will.  I was with Florida people, they love a douchey club.  I was told that this was not douchey and was supposed to be amazing.  We also had ""VIP clearance"" thourgh a friend of a friend.
VIP lines are just as moronic as the 'regular people.'  Basically we all got into the VIP line and STILL stood for 45 minutes being moved around from one place to another by self important douchebags and skanks with ear monitors in. There was a huge amount of 'talking' going on between all of the poeple, checking of names, we had our stamps checked no less than 15 times.  After about 5 or 6 'clearance areas', we finally walk in.  It was empty.  I haven't laughed that hard in a LONG time.  45 minutes in line, being held up all to look busy.

Let me break it down for you.

Pros:
- We contacted a promoter who directed us to the manager who led us into a ladies only line. Since we had our names on the guestlist, we were quickly ushered through the line with little trouble
- We got to take the elevators up to the main floor and during the night, the very nice elevator man let us take the elevators up and down from the hip hop room (3rd floor) to the main floor (4th floor)
- Upon entering the club, we were greeted warmly by many workers
- Bars in the hip hop room remained pretty empty making it easy to buy drinks quickly

Cons:
- TINY dance floor on both the main EDM floor and hip hop floor = massive crowding, uncomfortable dancing, unwelcome sweat exchanging between strangers
- Had to arrive early in order to get in (before 10pm - which by vegas standards is practically the break of dawn)
- We had one girl arriving late to the club and was originally ensured by the promoter she would be on the list and have no problems getting in.... WRONG! We paid expedited entry ($60) for our one girl and then got yelled at, cursed at and berated by the bouncers, head security and guestlist girl. I've NEVER been treated in such a manner before, especially after paying the expedited entry fee willingly.
- The main EDM floor was so incredibly packed, we couldn't see Calvin Harris when he finally came on stage around 1:30am. We ended up leaving since there was nowhere to stand, nowhere to dance, and nowhere to sit.

Bottom line: beautiful club, the little you get to see of it. If you come early and are a group of only girls, entrance is easy but don't expect hospitality or service from the people who work the entrance. Even if I had the $5k to buy a table here, I'd refuse to come back, simply because of the way they treat people here.",2,0,0

He came around 1:00 AM in the morning and stayed for about 3 hours. He was great. His songs were great. I loved him and planning to go back. One nice thing the club did, the gave out wristbands with the name of tiesto on it and they had wireless lights on them and when he came to perform, those wristbands were turning on and off which was amazing.

However, if you buy a VIP ticket it costs $100 for entrance but they give you a gift card for $100 at the bar, so you basically get in for free!  I thought this was a great deal!

SUMMARY: 
Had to try this place due to hype but I wouldn't rush to come back here. Its made for people who have money to spend on tables, the tables have security, walls, and great views of the show. The rest of the people are left milling about with no where to sit, no where to lean,  hoping to catch a glimpse of the headliner. The air flow is horrid, and the drinks are expensive. I'd rather go to XS.

GOOD:
Bought presale tickets, no problems in ilne, there was no line. Friends got in free later that evening. I heard it was slow in LV with only Tiesto being a headliner.

The service is GREAT. WTF right? ""Welcome to Hakkasan, have a fun night!"" was twice said to me. I asked where the restroom was and they kindly explained where to go instead of shining a flash light in the general direction. When faced with a crowded hallway no flashlight was shined in my face. How refreshing! 

Hip hop room. Had a few famous people, good music, 2 bars with few lines. 

BAD: 
$19 shot, its a shot. Woo.

$9 water, no tap water will be sold to you. I did get a cup of ice once though. 

$15 mixed drink that even I, a person who drinks once in a blue moon, thought it was a weak drink. More like coke and cranberry juice. 

No where to sit or lean for a girl in heels, dance floor is crowded as usual.

It's too big. Maybe it gets better if you go there often, but we kept wandering in circle and losing members of our group. Forget about dancing on the main dance floor. You need to shove through people and then can kind of move parts of your body, sometimes. 

I also don't love electric music and the music is a deal breaker on the type of time I have at a club. This was also the only club out of the six I went to that our group didn't have a table or VIP treatment. Maybe I'd feel differently if we had a table.

I was impressed going into this place, but I'm a simple guy who does not have high expectations for Vegas clubs.  I'm a resident here now and only venture to party on the Strip when friends and family are in town.  Another reason for not going to these clubs, is probably my age, I'm like a Detective Murtaugh sometimes and feel that I'm ""too old fo' this sheeet"", haha! But hey I felt young when I saw this caucasian dude in his fifties, maybe sixties, with a nice Magnum PI style Hawaiian button up walk into the club.  The staff was giving me issues for wearing a sweater! WTH, so what if I don't have a collar! Does that make me more dangerous! lol...Well enough about that, as I got in under the radar.  

I usually judge places like this on the quality of the ""Hip Hop\/RnB Room"".   The vibe was pretty good in here.  DJ there was on point with the old school, I felt like I was at Booty Hop or Kaboom (in the Bay back in the day), haha!  It was not too crowded, but had a fair amount of bumpin and grindin.  It was cool to see and experience Ms. Jenny Lynn from Nebraska get hyphy when E40 was being played.  There's your shoutout Jenny!

Most people were in the main room where they play electronic dance music, the DJ lineup is pretty dope for fans of the music - check the lineup for the summer. I could almost understand why the admission price is pretty high, it is like going to a concert if you're a fan of DJ's like Tiesto, deadmau5 or Calvin Harris.

The negatives - drink prices and admission, but that's a given, it a club in the middle of Vegas Blvd.  The collar issue. Lots of stairs, but actually that might be a positive, I didnt have to do any cardio today.

- Guestlist lines were confusing and ridiculously long. There's a ladies and a general, we don't know which way we want to go if the girls can go in first or we need to stay with the guys to have the even girl guy ratio.

- Stairs EVERYWHERE and I mean it. Not only are there long ass dangerous concrete stairs to connect 3rd, 4th, and 5th floors, but on the 4th main floor, there were up and down steps all around the back. Unavoidable. That means if you want to get a drink or go to the bathroom you had to walk on steps. No wonder they sell flip flops in the bathroom.

- No outdoor area. Other popular clubs like XS, Marquee, Tao, Pure? all have outdoors area to chill, hear the music, see a Vegas view. Hakkasan lacked this which meant it was stuffy and smokey as hell. The whole place was so dark you feel like you're in a dungeon the whole time. Wouldn't be surprised to have girls fall on their face on the steps 

- Small main dancefloor. This is #1 come on, you hire such good talent and charge guys a ridiculous price and theres not really room to see the dj? The floor was maybe a little wider left to right than Marquee but not as long front to back way.. if that makes sense. So you wouldn't get the whole stage view if you weren't front middle to back middle. And the left and right entrances to the dancefloors were poorly designed because 1\/3 was to go into the tables area, so ppl would fall into the flimsy railing area or not know which way to go. At least Marquee had clearly designed wide walkways leading into the dancefloor that is a half-wall on the left and right so you won't fall into the table area or anything. 

- Little room to see the dj. So the floor is out because theres not enough room to walk in and out from the left and right walkways, too crowded (I'm sure in the middle of the dancefloor there is a good space because ppl give up midway and push their way back.) But there's no other spots to see the dj because everyone at the tables that surround the dancefloor is fucking standing up and blocking the view. Like the little up and down steps in the back? The good thing is people lean against the railings and theyll have a view. There were ppl pouring over every railing, mini-balcony, half-wall, behind tables-areas just so they can see the dj. This was the most upsetting because we all came to see the talent and people had to settle for standing on a step and leaning on the railing in order to get ""a good spot."" Marquee is considered too small and packed but at least wherever you are you can see the dj and not be blcoked by people standing up from tables (because all the tables were in front middle.) The 5th floor balcony definitely can't see the stage because all the tables are in front of the railings, blocking the ""regular"" people standing in the back.

- No water. $10 for small Fiji bottle, no tap water, and no water fountains. Bitches trying to rip us off. 

- Complicated layout. Stairs to go to 3rd, 4th, and 5th floors were not near each other, no signs, no way to know where to go or where anything is. 

GOOD:
- Sound system, lights, and background stage designs were good. Dj and music were good and up to expectations. Did Tiesto play from 1-4am or maybe longer?

- Bouncers are nice, kindly directing you to the stairs or bathrooms, which is very important because of the confusing layout. I must have asked them a question like 10 times and they were so patient. 

- 3rd floor is a hip hop room and played late 90s to 2000 era, pretty good. But does it close at 12am? Sigh..

- TABLES. The only time to go to hakkasan, SERIOUSLY, is if you get a table. They have the best views, there are many, and you can sit. Basically the people in the tables ruined it for the rest because they would block all the views, in my opinion. 

CONCLUSION:
Hakkasan is trying to appeal to the richer crowd, people who are willing to throw down money for tables. If you don't get one and don't go to the dancefloor early, you may not enjoy yourself.",8,0,0

Because there are two dance floors it made it comfortable for people to listen to whatever kind of music they want to listen to because there was a hip hop dance floor on the bottom floor and the main dj on the top. I spent most of my time at the bottom dance floor because the music was soooo loud on the top floor. Both of the dance floors are pretty small too. I feel that the space is mainly catered to the people who get bottle service, which is not many because if you get bottle service downstairs you would have to stay there. They also do not give you glow sticks that usual night clubs do in Vegas. 
I guess I can't complain because I got in for free because I was with a bunch of girls and we had a promoter. But one thing about that was we had to wait in line for a hour just to get in, because they said we had to be there by a certain time, but they just made us wait. 

One thing that annoyed me was that there was NOOOOOOO place to sit, unless you got bottle service. Which was ridiculous because not everybody gets bottle service when you go clubbing and for you to not let customers sit down because they didn't have bottle service is annoying and it really did not make me want to go there again. Every time someone was sitting on a ledge of something, security would come over and tell the person to get down. Even in the lounge area there were no seats. There were just tables where you would stand with your drinks. 

There is also no water fountain where you can get free water. You have to buy small SMALLLLL Fiji water bottles for $9 and hope that will last you the whole night.

A lot of my friends have hyped up this place up for me but currently this place has only disappointed me.",2,0,0

This place has got to have the most booths I have seen at one place. It's cray.
This place is literally covered in booths. Capitalizing!

We had a booth on the right side of the stage. Sunday is Hip-Hop, fyi.
Rev Run made an appearance towards the end of the night.

The main dance floor is crowded as hell but we braved it because I needed a change of scene from our booth.

Then one of the security guards asked us if we wanted to dance upstairs. So we said 'yes,' I shouldn't have been surprised that it was a booth upstairs with guys that wanted girls in their booth. Had a great view of the stage. 

This club used to be Studio 54 back like 3 years ago... full of douche bags. They've been constructing every time we've visited. This is the first time it's been open since I've been there.

What other Yelpers said about all the stairs is true. All the little levels you have to go up is pretty cray when you think about all the drunk people trying to get around the club. Just sayin'",1,1,1

I remember being invited to the opening night if you years back I believe in 2013
It was a madhouse and they lost everyone's reservations. 
I recognise everyone that showed up everyone from Las Vegas was there but no one could get to their tables because everything was so chaotic and everything was lost
That was only my first time we eventually did get in but I only stayed there for about 20 minutes

The last time that I was there it was just a cesspool of ugly people tourists and the music was absolutely terrible. 
I think mainly in part is because it is located in the NGM they now charge for parking not on the valet but everywhere the hotel is huge and just to get to the club your feet are going to kill you you are going to wait in a huge long line it doesn't matter if you have a table or not for some reason they get very picky on who they let in. 
So you are always a good hour just to get in this place and be very disappointed.

Any time that my friends say that they want to go here I always meet up with them afterwards at drains and I go elsewhere.
I just never had a good time at this club between the people that are in there and the way they run it is just crappy. I think the drinks are way overpriced in comparison to other nightclubs in Las Vegas I don't know how this place is still running.",6,7,1

If you go there do not plan on going to the restroom as it is no where near the main stage.  Calvin was amazing by the way.  A pretty awesome experience.  He hit the main stage around 1:15AM.

Regarding the club itself; I thought the folks getting us into the club did a solid job.  Pretty efficient which I can respect.  Bars are not closely situated to the main club \/ dance floor and leaving the main dance floor is a huge pain.

Pros
- Awesome DJ lineup if you're really into the EDM crowd
- Expect celebrities walking in and out of this crowd because it's the new hot spot to be at in Vegas
- Security is strict, but fair. We didn't have a table but the security didn't really mind that there was an empty table that we sat at and they gave up opportunities to stand by the balcony even though we weren't supposed to be there. Much appreciated!
- Bathrooms are huge and clean
- Multiple floors of different genres - I enjoyed the main stage and the hip hop room. Apparently there is a pavilion that I didn't even find out about

Cons
- Stairs so it isn't friendly for those who were wearing heels, however, there is an elevator but it is usually pretty packed
- Expect are really large entry fee if you didn't buy pre-sale tickets and GL is pretty long
- Drinks are expensive but that is expected of Vegas clubs",2,0,1

The place is so packed, there literally was no space to move. I thought night clubs were meant for dancing but the main floor was so packed that it was suffocating. I am not exaggerating! Just imagine being pushed up against a wall- thats how we felt. We were literally hugging everyone around us.

Not only are you standing in one spot one night, it was nearly impossible to get to the bar. When you finally get to the bar, everything was overpriced- including the WATER. I have never in my life thought to pay $20 for a bottle of water!!! The drinks were approximately the same price. So luckily there were water fountains by the restrooms, which took about 20 minutes to get to because of the crowd. 

It was 2:30 am- we were tired, thirsty, and still waiting for Tiesto to show up. Waiting desperately since the dj prior to him showing up was the worst. After 3 hours of waiting, we decided to leave and had way more fun gambling at a casino with fresh air and leg room.

Heard about Hakkasan from one of the guys who is giving out ""free tickets"" along the strip. This first part is important because they take your name and phone number. This information is (probably) sold or used unscrupulously. My girlfriend readily gave this info in exchange to be out on a ""guest list"".

Fast forward to the night of, we arrived at midnight, when there was a cutoff of 12:30 AM to get in free. I consulted the dress code on their website and also cross referenced other reviews which said that dress code was not strictly adhered to. Wearing a nice button up and dark wash jeans, as well as $100+ Nikes, I was denied entry when others who were wearing $20 white Converse  were allowed entry.

Also, the cut off was changed to midnight and we had an entry fee of $50 for men, women were free.

My advice, listen to the reviews. This is like any other ""exclusive"" type nightclub. Treatment is heavily skewed on basis of appearance, drinks are overpriced, staff is unfriendly, and the ""talent"" they book is hardly talented.

However, the layout almost strictly caters to tables as the whole club is littered with them.

The hip-hop floor is cool though...so definitely check it out if you feeling some hip-hop.

Last Friday for Tiesto, my second time there, a bouncer kicked my girl out cause we were waiting for Tiesto and she rested her head on my chest. LIKE WTF? These fools have no idea what to do cause the entire night they were looking for people to kick out for no reason! They followed my homie around the whole night but he didn't do anything wrong so they didn't kick him out. They are pretty much useless ass bouncers with nothing better to do. I don't even know his name but he was a short scruffy looking white guy. Obviously must have some sort of Napoleon complex...but man, waste of money for my Tiesto ticket.

We took the elevator upstairs since that's what the majority of people were doing.  I'm not really sure what floor we went to but ended up where Tiesto was supposed to spin at.  Headed to the bar to the left of us and then headed straight to the dance floor in front of the DJ that was spinning at the time.  Guess you can say it's an arena style setup.  The sound system in here is top notch.  Lights were really good too.  Everything synced up well.  Even the free Tiesto wrist bands.  Music pretty much got me pumped all night without having too many drinks.  We did pre-game before heading here but I didn't drink that much since I was the DD.  Tiesto's set was really great that night.  I usually can't listen to too much of his stuff but it was on point.  Later on went up and to the other bar on the other end.

- Don't wear heels

It was 'Very Vegas' in terms of the lay out. They had part of the dance floor as a walk way around reserved tables, similar to a strip club. So women would dance up high and guys sitting at reserved tables could watch. That doesn't exactly scream classy like the bathroom attendants would imply. 

The main problem? The bar tenders. There was only like two at each bar. There wash't a line to get a drink, but it took forever to get served. Okay Hakkasan, not many people are going to spend $18 on a drink (so i understand the understaffed bar) but for those who are, SERVE THEM QUICKER!

Totally unlike LA clubs where the Guest list line is so long and pretty much ignored until the cut off time.

Not cool was this club is basically 80% VIP tables. And it's SO much smaller than what I imagined! The dance floor is small. There's no other place to dance bc of all the tables. Upstairs is ALL tables. 90% of them were empty.

You know what else is not cool? Playing WHACK ass music before the main DJ comes on. ""Hip Hop hooray! Ho! Hey! Ho!"" Yes I'm serious. We stayed for about an hour and couldn't take it anymore, so we left before Jesse Marco came on. We hadn't heard of him before, so we looked on Youtube and he's got kind of a Justice thing going on.

We were sold a table for $1500 including tax and tip. We were told it would be in the EDM section. Cool enough, there was just my girlfriend and I and we wanted a place to sit and watch Tiesto.

Right before going up the elevator there was suddenly an issue. ""OH, you're on the 3rd floor. That's Rap\/Hip Hop. If you want EDM music it's $2500 + tax and tip""

I have to say, it was my first time at Hakkasan this past weekend and I was completely disappointed with the place. I've never been before because of all the stories I hear from friends about the poor layout and ambiance, but I figured that I should go at least once. Well my first experience was my WORST experience ever at a nightclub. Not only were the hip hop and main rooms jam packed with people, but there was also barely any space to walk from one end of the room to the next. The rooms are filled with tables, so if you have a table you might be able to enjoy yourself, but other than that there is no room to dance or even stand. If you stay in one spot, you'll end up getting pushed around from all sides. I recall my group having to snake and push our way through the entire club that night.

And besides the floor plan that should have been for a restaurant, not a nightclub, I got my phone and cash jacked straight out of my purse at the main room dance floor. Apparently Hakkasan is infamous for pick-pocketers, so if you want a good time in Vegas do yourself a favor and avoid this place entirely. As I was leaving the main dance floor, I see all my purse zipper compartments opened and my valuables gone. And calling the Lost & Found the next morning won't do much good either.",11,1,0

The lighting, sound, special effects, and layout are perfect! Only 2 things that kept me from giving 5 stars. Hakkasan is to warm, turn the AC on. And the second issue is drink prices. I paid $22 for a well gin and tonic and a small bottle of water. They don't give out free glasses of water and they make sure the bathroom water is warm so it's not quenching enough to wanna drink.

Friend: it will be better once we get inside.

She was right too.

Yes, it's a huge step up from when it was Studio 54, but based on everything else I was up to in Vegas, Hakkasan is ok I guess. I kinda regret not bringing my Kanye sunglasses so I could truly appreciate the strobe lights too.

+1 star for the music (""unz unz unz"")
-1 star for the crowd

Some of them kinda got up in our business and were a bit too sophomoric for me (""like oh mah gawd I only got 10 likes in the last 5 minutes let me take another selfie"").

Unfortunately, it's one of my least favorite nightclubs. My coworkers and I decided to come out and had everything set up through a host. We arrived around 10:30pm since opening wasn't until 11pm. It's a really long walk from from the parking garage and valet. Their lines are extremely confusing and unorganized. We were the first in line for table reservations and waited... and waited and waited some more. The lines grew and things began to get a little chaotic. The bouncers are extremely and unnecessarily rude and think they run the place. I get it, it's Vegas and money talks. Needless to say, after waiting in line for about 45 minutes and watching people cut in front of us, we finally make it to the next line to wait some more. ID checks were next and I've NEVER had an issue with my ID. I get they're doing their job, but they were just ridiculous while checking my ID. At this point, I was irritated and over everything. We FINALLY get inside and get seated. There was about 15 of us and we were told 2-3 bottles for our group. As soon as we were done with the first one, they start cleaning our table and removing everything. We told our server we had 2-3 bottles, she just shrugged and said we only had one and continued to finish cleaning. Didn't even bother to check for us or anything. Everyone in our group ended up leaving afterwards. 

It looks like a beautiful club and the music sounded great, but the service and unorganization is what destroyed it for me.

My buddy bought presale tickets so were in line for less than 20 minutes.  I agree with the other reviewers when the say that if you don't have you stuff together ahead of time, expect a long wait.  It's unreasonable to roll up to general admission at one of the newest clubs in Vegas and not expect to wait a long time.

The club itself was dark, cavernous, and full of stairwells.  I got lost a couple of times, but overall the club was pretty pleasing to the eye.  If you're not good with stairs, I don't recommend this place for you.

Calvin Harris started at 1AM till I have no idea when.  I left at 2:30 so I'm going to assume that he did his thing till 4.  The DJ booth is elevated over the main stage with a balcony type thing above it.  DUring parts of his set, dancers would come out and do some crazy cirque du soleil shit.  Overall I was pretty entertained for 4 hours.  I still have a ringing in right ear though.

The crowd is fairly diverse, but probably leans to the more affluent, douchier demographic.  When Calvin Harris was on the turn tables, everyone was into the music and the energy was high, so that was a pus.

Read this review with some bias since I have very little to compare it to.  If you're a club aficionado, I apologize for not being a 23 year old chicken head.",5,10,2

The stage is tiny and the dance floor is meh. We went to see The Chainsmokers that night and I already knew it would be packed (crowd was awful but that's not the club's fault) but there was literally no room to even move at all. Once again it's the club's way to make money-sell lots of tickets as many as they can, and who cares if the guests have a good time as long as they've been paid right?-but for a club THIS small, it's kind of awful lol.

The staff working that night was so useless. Our friends got separated from us and were on the third floor and when we asked the standing staff what floor we were on they said 3rd-two hours later we found out we were on the 2nd. Bravo Hakkasan.

We came to Vegas with absolutely no plan on which clubs we would go to. Our new British friends mentioned that they were heading to Hakkasan to see Tiesto so we decided to go. Even our taxi driver earlier in the day suggested we go there since it's the ""top club in Vegas right now"", so we knew we had to see what all the hype was about.

My cousin and I got on the guestlist (thank you Dustyn!) so getting into the club was easy and the lines weren't too bad. I would get here early and highly suggest getting on a guestlist! The club was so packed around 11:30.

Much like TAO, the decor of Hakkasan left me wanting more. It's definitely spacious but there was no ""wow"" factor, at least for me. I did love all the lights and confetti, though! There are 5 different floors but we stayed on the main floor for Tiesto. Ladies, wear wedges or bring flats because there is absolutely no place to sit! I hate wearing flats with dresses but for the sake of my already sore and swollen toes, I had to bust out the TOMS, haha. 

Drinks were so expensive! Two drinks ran us about $45; since it's Vegas' newest club, pricey drinks are to be expected but that's just ridiculous for vodka and redbull. They have tons of VIP tables that surround the main floor and also on the other top floors.

Though we had a great time at Hakkasan and Tiesto was amazing, I'm not sure I'd be back unless there was another DJ I wanted to see or I had table service. However, definitely worth a shot if you want to try something new!",12,7,10

So massive in fact - you can fit the entire white house + some, inside of the space  Gorgeous blue waves reflect off the elevated cement walls.  I'm not a fan of all the randomly placed steps inside the club, but most of the security guards carry flashlights to help ladies navigate in their heels (thank goodness).  This was one of the first clubs I have been to where the bouncers were actually nice - so I give them a lot of credit for that.  Just about every guest who entered the club got a sincere smile and welcoming.  The elevator staff was engaging and friendly too!  

My favorite part of the club was the back room on (what I believe to be) the 4th floor - may have been third floor.  Gorgeous ferns garnish the walls with thin waterfalls separating each individual plant.  The design is gorgeous and the plants make the halls smell like you're walking through a tropical rainforest.   
 
The main dancing floor houses the DJ booth, which is definitely highlighted as the main feature.  Wooden designs are carved throughout the walls and the ceilings.  The dancefloor was a bit small in my opinion,  reminded me of Tryst.

We walked through the entire club, stopping at almost every bar along the way.  I could see the bars being hard to get to if it's a busy night (the largest is around 30 feet in length).  

The sound is probably the best quality I've heard at a club in Las Vegas.  They have a VERY impressive lineup of DJs.  Calvin Harris, Tiesto, Deadmau5, the list goes on...  

I'll be looking forward to the opening of their restaurant.  I'll be back for this.  If you're considering Hakassan, I would highly recommend reserving a table.  Every table I saw in the club was good - spacious and comfortable.  

If you don't end up reserving a table, their are areas that overlook the dance floor that hold miniature countertops - so if you need to rest your drink, you can.  : )

I definitely rank this club above Marquee.  If you're not into the outdoor club scenes (like Surrender or XS), Hakkasan is your best option while in Vegas.

I'm looking forward to coming back.",18,4,11

When we first entered the club we ended up on a level playing a sweet club-music mix.  We walked up a platform to dance along the bottle service tables, and within 20min were joined by a guy in a giant mouse costume and showered in confetti.  Now THAT is a Vegas experience!

When it can't get any better, it does, and we leveled-up (literally) to dance to Tiesto until 4am.  What a blast: hot pole dancers and performers took the upper stage over his head while a light show played on the walls and confetti and glitter rained down on us.  I don't think I've ever raged so hard in my life.  Although the music was still playing at 4am, I had to take my sore feet home while Tiesto was still finishing his second bottle of vodka up on stage.  Just a couple warnings:
-Bring drinks for the wait in line.  The drinks in the club are so pricey (think $9 for a tiny bottle of water) that you'll want to arrive drunk
-Make sure you have legit ID- we saw quite a few people turned away and I can't imagine how much that SUCKS after waiting over an hour
-Check out multiple levels when you finally get in
-Stay all night.  We saw a ton of drunks leaving early- and after the long wait why miss out on an all-night party?

This club is gorgeous, HUGE, and the acts they draw are out of this world.  Although the tickets are pricey, and the wait is long, it is SO worth it.  If you stay at the MGM, this is a must.  Thank you, Vegas.  And thank you, Hakkasan, for closing my weekend on such a high note!",4,2,5

MGM did a great job contracting the world's best DJ's like Tiesto, Deadmau5, Calvin Harris etc. They bring the music to a whole new type of space- a multi deck arena!

We had a table in the Ling-Ling room, forked out $2k for multiple bottles, but price is relevant to the artist and demand. I was disappointed about the music in Ling-Ling as it was not the main stage artist playing. But it all worked out because we could mix up our night by exploring the different rooms.

It was super crammed.  So first my boyfriends wallet either got stolen or fell out of his pocket on the dance floor. People were also stroking my hair rubbing their butts on my leg. Just strange. While my boyfriend and I were on the dance floor dancing like sticks cuz there was no where to move, trying not to stand or fall on all the trash, bottles, and glassware on the floor all of a sudden I felt something splashing on my feet thinking it was someones drink falling yet again I look down and there is a disgusting pig of a man PISSING ON THE DANCE FLOOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Full stream and everything standing next to me splashing hot piss onto my feet. As I move away he zips up turns around and starts dancing again.  We immediately leave the floor which then they were roping people off so you weren't allowed to leave the dance floor unless you snuck under the ropes to get away. We told a security guard what happened and he said something on his radio and that was it.

I don't know why people complain about the security, they were very nice to me and the group I was with. I would come here again in a heartbeat!!! I would love to see all 5 levels of the club, especially the Ling-Ling room were they play hip hop",0,0,0

Came here Saturday night to see Tiesto, but ended up leaving at 1 when being so fed up with crowds and ""security"" or bouncers, whatever they're called.

Arrived at around 10:30, and went to look for prepaid line, was told it was on the other side because the line was ""overflowing"". Which when we get to the over flow line, was called back to the original spot we were standing in. There was one small group there ahead of us. At one point in line I overheard two of the staffers talking about some girls tramp stamp, loudly and not discreet at all. Rude. 

Inside, no real standing space. You're either on the dance floor, in a bottle service booth, or in the way. To which one staffer made it his job that night to keep telling me and my boyfriend we couldn't stand wherever we were standing. But whenever it was girls standing there, he had no problem at all.

After having enough of that guy, we headed to the jammed packed dance floor, which was probably smaller than my backyard. Everyone was shoulder to shoulder pushing and shoving.

The worst part was the things that happened on the dance floor. Two girls were so drunk out of their minds, a group of guys were passing them around taking turns making out with them while another guy took photos. Lifting the girls dresses, sticking their hands on their panties, even though the girls knew enough to keep pulling down their dresses and saying no. Practically rape. Fights nearly breaking out, people falling on the floor. Horrible.

When we finally had enough, trying to make our way out, some girl was openly lighting her bong in the hallway. Idk how that made it in but yep. 

Police, fire Marshalls etc. need to look into this place ASAP!  Horrible. 

Oh, and sister ended up leaving at 1:30, and still no Tiesto.",12,3,2

The biggest DJ's in the world always play here and it's unlike any other experience. I was one of the lucky ones to go on stage when Steve Aoki played, truly iconic.
 
Two main things to take into account: 

If you love EDM, come to this club. If you have ever been to a music festival you know what it's like to dance in tight spaces since most of the time you'll be jumping. Be prepared to do that here, especially if a well known artist is playing. If that's not your thing, I wouldn't recommend, it can get really crowded. 

Since they consider this a ""high end"" type of club they charge you for water, not just any type of water but the times I've gone they only give out bottles of Fiji water- you already know that's pricy, let alone sold in a club, so keep that in mind. I bet you're saying to yourself who drinks water at the club? I do! Especially if I'm dancing in a crowded space, I need my water. That might just be me though, either way if the water is pricy you already know the drinks are even more.

Second-which I think is the most important tip... find yourself a promoter. They are everywhere, honestly they are not hard to find and their always looking for people to help out that are visiting and trying to have fun. For girls, they got you, you'll get in free here and pretty much anywhere. For guys, they will sometimes give you a discounted price depending if their nice or not. If not, then you have to pay full price to get in. Although, it's not always a bad thing because say you go with your girlfriend at least you won't have to pay for her right? Lol.

The hype about this club is real (in my opinion) I've been here multiple times and have always had nothing but memorable nights. If you're contemplating this club between another in Vegas, go to Hakkasan.",6,2,1

Since I've been to many of the big nightclubs in Vegas, I feel that I have some sort of accurate gauge on this club, and I'd say Hakassan was ""okay"" compared to the other big clubs.

XS has been my favorite club thus far and Hakassan is nothing like it, especially on a warm summer night. The club does not have any outdoor area and unless you have a table, you're probably gonna find yourself just walking on\/off the dance floor back and forth from the bar or the back of the club. In comparison to XS or Marquee, it's pretty small. But compared to Tryst, it's spacious. I had fun last night, despite the club not being the best nightclub. The drink prices vary from night to night so be prepared for paying over $20\/drink.

Overall, I'd say it's a nice club. I had a good time but that's mostly due to having good company. I would probably go back, but next time just on a night when a DJ that I really enjoy is playing.",1,0,1

On that front the music on the 'electronic music floors' was great, really good.

There are two floors of 'hip\/hop'...hard pass on that noise.

So we got in for free (thanks friend hookup!), and I am glad as we would have had to wait in line for a good hour, and the guys would have to pay 2x as much as the girls.  I get it, guys like to be around girls, guys like to buy drinks for girls, girls like to dance in groups.  Makes good math sense.  Still...sucks to pay $60 to get in, and then experience what it's like inside.

So so so packed.  This isn't dancing, this is being herded into a dance pit like cattle and then getting jostled and shoved with the group. Soooo fun (eye roll)

My friend got two whiskey and soda's and paid $40.
I got a soda water with lime, and paid $7.

The only good seats are at bottle service tables, and if you stand anywhere you can't see the DJ booth because there are so many pillars in the place there is no clear view anywhere.

If I ever went back, I'd pool a grand between our friends and get bottle service and a table ont he top floor.

My last experience her, I was with a group of about 8 sexy ladies and one sweet gay dude. It was Halloween so the majority of my friends were half naked and scantly clad. Anyway, 9 is a large group, my friend was offered a comp table.  

We arrived by the check and had no issues past the first round of bouncers. As we approached the stand the bouncer told my friend that a part of the nightclub wasn't open and that they'd comp our admission and offer us each a free drink ticket. What the what?! It's a Sunday, which is their industry\/locals night. Whatever, my favorite Producers\/DJs were spinning (Dada Life) and I was dead set on having a great time. 

Hakasux has a really crappy layout. A group of 9 can no way stock together. I ended up with two of the ladies and we braved it on the dace floor. Smooshed like sardines. This is typical. I can't blame Hakasux for this at all. This is just what Vegas nightlife has turned into.

Normal club happenings occur, then during Dada Life's performance there was a giant pillow fight (set to their track Happy Violence - irony not lost on me) and it was way too much fun until all of a sudden my friend grabbed my arm and said out friend was hit in the head with an empty bottle (like some jerk from a table tossed their bottle of goose into the crowd). We immediately scrambled off. My friend has a friend that works security in the club, so informing him, he took my us upstairs to be triaged. The EMTs were kind and professional.

After this whole ordeal we left. Not even a sorry about your experience, nothing. I doubt I will ever set for in this place again. They may have top name DJs but f these antics continue I don't see Hakasux having much sticking power. Go to Light\/ XS\/ Surrender instead.",10,7,3

People are so rude and drunk that they physically fight and crawl to go forward but stand your ground and tell them no and they usually back off. Capacity is 2 thousand and I kid you not there were easily at least 3500 people shoved inside. VIP is a joke as well. People who paid thousands of dollars were view blocked by girls that security let stand on their risers. Some of the VIP areas have TVs right in front of the viewing of the stage?? I would recommend this club for a big headliner only if you are okay with wasting thousands and don't care about getting lost in the awkward maze that is Hakkasan. Tiesto was filming lastnight as well so everyone who paid a ton of money got screwed over by the fan girls that were all granted access to overrun the VIP areas for the filming.

Also, another negative incident that occurred was when my friend (who I didn't go with at the time) went to Hakkasan for the 1st time and as he was getting his ID checked, the Top Flight Security accused him of handing them a fake ID.   First off, my friend is of age!  My friend said that they started instigating him and every TRUTHFUL response he gave them (since it was NOT a fake ID and he is OF AGE) was counteracted with some bullshit, imaginary excuse as to why they wouldn't let him in.

He paid up (what was he going to do) and we were in in less than 15 minutes.
The place is swanky! Yes, there are a ton of stairs but luckily I had planned my outfit accordingly and I was wearing flats. The group I was with love dancing till the wee hours, so I knew I had to come prepared. 

We got in around 11ish and danced for a while before deciding to go to the bathroom. At this point, they weren't letting anybody else on the dance floor so I made a point to reach out to one of the employees standing guard that I was leaving, and he said sure no problem.

We didn't realize it but Steve Aoki was going on first, before Deadmau5. I've heard of Aoki, but since clubbing and EDM is not really my scene I didn't know what to expect. Holy cow, the guy is crazy! He really knows how to work a crowd! He threw cakes to the ground, rode around on a raft with the crowd carrying him, and sprayed champagne all over the place.... I'm glad I was not at the front. He also has a great light show and cool dancers with him. You can tell a lot of thought goes into the performance. I just read that even the servers outfits were designed by him. They also played some crazy videos of him partying and I felt like I was watching a Behind the Music with Guns N Roses. Without a doubt, DJ's are the new rock stars. 

Deadmau5 came on at 4 and he started out kind of slow. We were all kind of pumped after Aoki's antics that it took people a while to get going again.

Hakassan is located at the MGM Grand and sports 3 floors of dance and entertainment. Two floors are dedicated to EDM music and the last floor is dedicated to Hip-Hop.

Atmosphere:

Even though so much money was poured into this club...it was poorly designed. The club is so big that once you lose your friends you will never find them again. The dance floor is so small and packed that you have trouble breathing...there is so much pushing and shoving on the dance floor and sweat soaked bodies...

When all the Vegas clubs are trending towards pool parties...Hakassan doesn't seem to be catching the drift...

Service:

The people who work here are not the best people. We reserved a table a month in advance and were quoted a price. On the day of the event we were told our table just went up by a couple thousand...It was then I realized reservation meant nothing...and table service was like an auction to the highest bidder...with the club trying to gouge you as much as possible...

Tips:
If you want to get into this club best arrive before 11 PM and buy an electronic ticket online. 

Summary:

Please do not go to this club unless you want to get raped on the dance floor...because trust me if you scream no one will hear you. 

They say money can't buy anything...and it applies to this club...you spend over $165 million it does not mean you will have the best club...Money doesn't BUY happiness. I am never coming back",13,19,4

I have several friends who have had their iphones stolen out of their bags. Like, the bags are zipped\/clasped\/locked up. It's not like ""oops I just left my phone at the table"" stuff.

Other reviews of this place:

""Do not go to this club, regardless of who is DJing. There is a crime ring that steals cellphones, IDs, credit cards, etc. straight out of your purse."" - Amy S.

""And a final warning, hold tight to those purses and constantly check your pockets. Pickpocketing has been and is still rampant here. My friend's two friends both noticed their purses were open and their phones were gone just this past weekend."" - Justin P.

""Oh, also a bunch of people have told me that people here will steal your stuff when you're in the more crowded areas, so be careful of that."" - Steph U.

""But with that comes a cesspool of clientele who will steal your phones and wallets. I was not alone this particular night--my 2 friends also got their phone stolen."" - Molly T.

""Warning anyone who comes to hakkasan, there is a theft ring who goes around stealing phones and wallets out of girls' purses while they are holding them on the dance floor."" - Jamie N.",3,1,0

Hakkasan misses the mark in nearly all facets of the nightclub business. This place is crowded, disorganized and pretty confusing to get around.

I typically get bottle service and even the bottle service at Hakkasan misses the mark as their tables were in odd locations and making your way to the dance floor is an absolute mess. Not much else to add other than the fact that Hakkasan kinda stinks relative to the other Vegas nightspot options.

Perhaps I am used to more plebeian clubbing conditions, but this place honestly wasn't that bad. Yes, the layout is kind of weird (VIP booths are in the middle and probably the best seat in the house), but I had plenty of space to dance once we got a spot next to the side bar. View of the DJ (Calvin Harris) was great and the sound quality was excellent. The ventilation at said side bar spot was AMAZING, I was wearing a long-sleeve shirt and didn't feel like I was going to leave a dessicated corpse. Yes, there is shoving, especially in the middle dance area which is nigh unbearable. Yes, the drinks are outrageously expensive ($16 for a Cape Cod dayummmm) but so is the rest of Vegas. I was expecting much, much worse and it was actually pretty good. The crowd was awful. The ratio of bros and biddies to anyone approaching anything civil was insurmountable. A veritable meat market. Some choice quotes ""Yo bro there's that bitch you passed up earlier in the night. She's looking more aggreable now, right bruh?"" ""OMG stairs are so hard!"" ""I'm going to puke. MOVE! I'M GOING TO PUKE"" These people were absolute disasters. Not the typical mollied-out-going-to-faint-from-lack-of-water types I'm used to, just unbelievably sloppy drunks. I don't blame the club; in fact, the staff did pretty well considering.  One other tip: buy your tickets in advance. It is much cheaper and you won't have to wait as long.

The team behind Hakkasan spared no expense in designing their colossal nightclub & restaurant. This megacomplex clocks in at over 80,000 square feet, giving it top honors as one of the nation's largest nightclubs. The highly sought-after DJ's can earn upwards of $200,000 per night. The lighting and the sound system are first-rate with concert-rated acoustics. There are 5 levels of club space with a variety of experiences on offer. 

The main level dance floor was outrageously packed. If you like being jostled around, elbowed and shoved, then you will definitely feel at home here.  If you even idled for even a second in a walkway, a bouncer would rudely yell at you to move --we were just trying to make our way to the front of the bar. The music wasn't my preferred-style of dance music--it was house music all night. The music selection wasn't the problem though, it was all the rudeness and shoving going on everywhere. The $18 rum 'n cokes and $10 beers definitely did not excite either (I know it's Vegas but my concert drinks at MGM Garden were $18 for a double). 

Despite the crowded dance floor, high-priced drinks and music, my girlfriends and I decided to make the most of the night and embrace the music and our Hakkasan experience. We danced and enjoyed the confetti drop and looking at some well-dressed fellas. We enjoyed rounding out our nightclub experience with the addition of Hakkasan.

CONS: There's no space to dance on the bottom floor. Everywhere is occupied by booths. You cant dance in front of booths (too crowded and bouncers keep pushing). You cant really dance behind the booth bc theres all these ppl dancing on top of the areas behind the booths. Theres no view of the DJs ANYWHERE unless youre right in front. I hung out with some people in a private booth upstairs. What was sad is that these kids paid close to $3000 but they were stuck in the cornermost space. So while they had awesome privacy and no one crashing into them, from their booth I couldn't even see the DJs or see the cool visual displays. How lame!

But the night we went they closed the other room that played hip hop.  That meant I had to spend four hours listening to essentially the same song. 

 EDM makes me feel like a crotchety old person.  It's repetitive, formulaic, not interesting.  I think EDM is a major force in driving the drug trade because I'm convinced you literally have to be on something to enjoy that crap.  And to all the people that dance slow and make heart symbols with their hands right before the climax in EVERY song (because they're all same) I know what's up.  And that ain't no one a day vitamins.  At least not the legit kind.  

I'm also inclined to complain about the fact that you can be parched, drunk and dying for ice water but they make you buy bottled water.  But its Vegas. Expect the ridiculousness of that.  

Also the stairs are a death trap. A friend of ours missed a step and flew super woman style down a flight of stairs only to be stopped cold by a concrete wall (maybe granite,  it was dark).  After a few drinks I usually point and laugh at stuff like that like a 10 year old.   But witnessing that made me grimace and grateful that wasn't my ass.

Unfortunately the worst one was the most recent one, so I have to believe that this club has gone downhill quite a bit since my first visit.

I was at Hakkasan to see Calvin Harris for New Year's Eve 2014-2015 with three other women. We started to get in line with our regular tickets but were almost immediately singled out and ushered into a VIP line, so we got in right away. Calvin Harris was amazing and Hakkasan put on a great New Year's show at midnight. Plus, while it was crowded, it wasn't insanely so.

Fast forward to this past weekend, when I went to see the Chainsmokers at Hakkasan. Three of us (two girls and one guy) bought VIP bar card tickets, the other three (one girl and two guys) just had regular admission tickets. It was basically a cattle call to get into the club and it took us at least 20 minutes to find someone who would even tell us where we needed to go for the bar cards. Along the way, we talked to two hosts who were INSANELY rude. The only one who was helpful was a blonde guy. One of the rude ones even yelled at me and my group to move out of the way...when we were stuck behind a crowd of people who were not moving. I've honestly never been treated so awfully at a club in Vegas before, and for this alone I won't go back to Hakkasan.

The ""funniest"" part is that despite our ""VIP entry"", those of us with the VIP got into the club maybe five minutes before our friends who didn't have it. The bar card made it worth it, in my opinion, but still, how frustrating\/obnoxious. I didn't have a big problem getting drinks at the bar, but the dance floor was so crowded that we couldn't even get anywhere near it. Thankfully there was an open area at the back of the club that allowed us to stand around and dance together, but it wasn't the same as actually SEEING the Chainsmokers, which again, we never got to do because we couldn't get within twenty feet of the dance floor (and trust me, we tried). It was definitely more crowded than it had been for New Year's Eve and to be honest I think they had way too many people in the club in general.

We bought presale tix which were $30 for girls and $50 for guys.  I thought this was a good deal since the non-presale tix line was RIDICULOUS and it was only about 10pm.  Our line was completely empty!  Once we got in, the club was DEAD EMPTY.  I felt like we were one of only a few patrons in the whole establishment.  With a line so long, I don't know why...

The club itself is very modern and cool to look at.  There's three stories:

TOP LEVEL: a bar and mostly table service.  The tables overlook the dance floor and stage where Calvin Harris was playing, but unless you have a table, you can't really do much up here.  We also found out that drinks on this level were in the $17-18 range, versus cheaper prices lower.

MEDIUM LEVEL: more tables with the stage and dance floor, which seems a bit small for the huge size of the club.  Again, tables line the dance floor and is tiered so they can see the stage.

BOTTOM LEVEL: is where ""hip hop"" music is played, though we found most of their song selections to be older hip hop\/R&B songs (pretty fun to reminisce, haha).  There's another smaller dance floor here where there seems to be a more ""chill"" vibe.  Tons of more tables encompass the rest of the floor and there's a small bar where we found we could buy drinks for $13 a piece.

The three stories definitely have a cool appeal and makes the club seem sophisticated and HUGE.  However, with the three stories, that's a lot of stairs to climb for a group of girls in 5"" heels!  To save on cost we were going to the bottom level bar every time we wanted a drink...so my feet and knees were SO sore by the end of the night.

Another thing to note as by my mention of so many tables is that the priority really seems to be table service at this club.  My friend asked a worker how much a table costs and it STARTS at $5k!  Dayum.

The CALVIN HARRIS concert was awesome.  He came on around 1:30am (my feet were so done by then) and there were so many cool effects on the dance stage like confetti and a constant laser light show!  Unfortunately, I only stayed a little while as my feet were so dead.  There really is NO PLACE TO SIT in this club.

Takeaway: GORGEOUS club, brand new, and definitely poppin'!  The stairs can be a real pain (literally), but I'd definitely come back.

We were seated at the owners table due to some my friends perks. The best table in the house right across from the dj booth. The cocktail waitresses were prompt and were there when you needed them. We had unlimited amounts of water, red bull and other chasers. We had our own bodyguard. I mean this was just an amazing overall experience. 

I will say this, do not even bother coming to this club if you are not getting a table, you will be stuck in bar lines and jammed packed dance floor.

Came here 2 nights ago for a bachelorette party.  We were on some VIP list, which never really means anything in my opinion, but somehow we made it into this ENORMOUS and overwhelming club with little waiting and no cover.  Tiesto was spinning that night and my understanding is that that is kind of a big deal.  Well, Tiesto may be all the rage, but if the club is SOOOO crowded that you can't move, walk or dance, then in my opinoin, Who the EFF cares who is spinning??  
Anyway, I spent most of my time standing in line, walking in a line or waiting for elevators while at Hakkasan, so I can't say it was a good experience, but I will say that on the 3rd floor, where they play hip hop and 90's music it was a little less crowded and a little less stupid.  Had I spent most of time there and disregarded Tiesto on the 4th floor, my rating would likely be higher.",7,4,3

Even if you get put on the guest list, don't expect to jump the line (unless you're a group of all girls, of course). Depending on which artist is performing, some nights are busier than others. When my friends and I came here, Steve Aoki was performing and we still had to wait in line even though we were put on the guest list. Our group had way too many guys to skip the line.  It wasn't a big deal, because we still got in for free.

Once inside, we were overwhelmed with how crowded this place was. I knew it was popular and expected it to be crowded, but not thaaat crowded. You're basically shoulder to shoulder with everybody. It got to the point where a few of my friends and I had to leave the dance floor, because it got extremely uncomfortable. 

I think once Hakkasan becomes a little less popular, it'd be more enjoyable. They let way too many people in there. The venue is really nice though. You can tell it's one of the newer clubs, especially by its size. You won't regret coming here, but keep in mind the tight space!",4,3,3

There is limited bar space, limited free space, and rearlly no central location where people hang out. If you fight your way to the dance floor there's a good chance you'll be stuck there for a while.  I just felt trapped in our table and the setup isn't conducive to walking around, hanging out at a bar, or even going to the dance floor to dance. They essentially just want to pack people in and have them drink and dance in place, I didn't like it. The crowd wasn't very attractive and the music was something I may have enjoyed 10 years ago but is now truly ""pots and pans"" music.

We reserved a table through a promoter who said that everything was all set for that night. We get there and end up waiting an hour only to find out that they had doubled the minimum on our table on us. Not cool. 

There was no discernible line for people who had reserved tables and it was utter chaos trying to get the bouncer's attention. 

It's beyond me how a club in Vegas can have such horrible operations. Did a child put their plan together? Is there no competent adult overseeing the venue? 

Avoid it if you can. There are much better clubs elsewhere.

Coming to Hakkasan, I had high expectations. Only because I hear they some of the best DJ's in the world. The interior and exterior was nice, but not over the top fancy. 

I came the night DADA LIFE was performing. I was excited. I came around 10 or 11 pm and started lining up for the guest list with my friends. It was one of the most confusing things ever, because they had MULTIPLE lines that were different. One was for tickets, promoter\/staff guest list, regular guest list, etc. Every time you asked a bouncer where to go, they would tell you to go here and there, it was all confusing. 

Coming in, my friends and I had to climb stairs..lots of stairs. Why are there so much stairs?! There are even like 2-4 steps of stairs to go to the bar! They need to remodel this place and turn those stairs into ramps because that can be dangerous, especially if you have no guidance or if you're effed up drunk. But then again, maybe that's why those annoying security guards\/bouncers are there - to flash the flashlight in your face or on the floor. The bouncers\/security are cocky too because if you stand on the side or anywhere even just to rest, enjoy a drink and listen to the music, or chit chat with a friend, they'll tell you to move out of the way. Where else can we go if we can't even sit down? Apparently down in the middle of nowhere hallway, where you can't even hear the music anymore! 

Dance floor was small! My friends and I tried to go to the hip hop floor or any floor that had good music, and we couldn't get past 3-5 people because there was literally no moving space. I'm a small person and I felt even tinier on the dance floor (with my 5 inch heels), because everyone would look down on me while I was trying to make my way around the dance floor to dance. When my friends and I got to the middle, we couldn't even dance because there was NO SPACE to even move. So we left. If you want to dance, the best place is probably dancing by the hallway or table..but even then. it's not enough space and it still sucks. It so hot and sweaty up on the floor because of the crowdedness. Hard to breathe too! 

If you want better service and space, the only way for that to happen is if you get a table. Other than that, good luck even getting anywhere in this tiny club. 

Good thing I got in free, cause I would've been upset if I had to pay and not enjoy my time here. Don't think I'm coming back again.",5,0,0

I consider myself somewhat of a club connoisseur and Hakkasan was among my favorites.  Of course, as any club-goer knows, an epic night is made up of a host of factors coming into play, so take my five-star rating of the club itself with a grain of salt.  

We arrived around 11pm with advance tickets for Calvin Harris and the line was really long, but moved quickly.  The venue itself is massive...it's a bit confusing to navigate the various levels, but we walked straight onto the main\/EDM level and were overwhelmed by the crowd.  After making our way to the bar, paying for a round of overpriced drinks (expected of any club in Vegas, so can't really deduct stars for it), and making our way to the dance floor, my friends and I decided to find the hip-hop room.  

One flight down lay a less crowded and exponentially more fun venue.  My friends and I pretty much camped out in the hip hop room for the rest of the night, and  didn't even mind missing Calvin Harris upstairs.  The music was on point (a mix of current stuff and throwbacks), and the crowd was great - not as many skeevy guys as in NY, but  we still got the right amount of attention that we all secretly crave (don't lie, you know you like it).   The set up was also great, with these platforms for girls to dance on (lots of fun!), and the bar separated from the dance floor for easy access.  The hip hop room closes before the main room, bc it emptied out around 3am (I think?  Who knows what time it was).

Lots of booths available if you want a private section
30 dollars for a ticket to get in is not a bad price at all


Cons: Smaller dance floor. The main floor is impossible to get to after 1130. It is so packed that they stop letting people on it and you are forced to stand on the walk way.
Drinks are incredibly expensive. 15 dollars for a well mix drink, and 18 for a Long Island. Drinks are weak too. Shots go for almost 20 dollars each.
Incredibly loud so if you think you are gonna get to talk to someone in there guess again.
Main dj didn't come on until almost 130 in the morning.
Once you exit the club their is no getting back in

The venue is beautiful. Although it is troublesome (all those damn stairs), that dome like roofish top with all those lights make the venue pretty awesome to check out. 

There is a hip hop lounge called the ling ling room if EDM isn't your thing. There's also occasionally the hip hop lounge open which is a bit more chill if you wanna be away from the craziness. FYI drinks costs an arm and a leg. I think it costs more than Light and XS!

But my main hate for this club isn't any of those things. As I do like the venue and I do like the DJ. I'm even very fond of my host...

It really just takes ONE guy. And that one guy is the same guy me and my friends always deal with. Its the guy that works the table line and checks you in for your tables. YES, THAT GUY.

Came here on a busy Sunday night to see one of my favorite DJs (Above & Beyond) Getting in was no problem. We were comped cover which was cool, i think its because we were on the guest list and we all have local IDs. This was a much smoother operation then the 1st time we ever came here where the door guys tried to hustle all of us for $100 each even though we had bought tickets to see the DJ. 

Once in the club its mayhem. Theres no rhyme or reason to the flow of the place. We found a not too crowded space that was very close to the bar and we pretty much stayed there all night. We attempted the dance floor once and that was a mistake. You literally could not move. There is no bouncer or anything to keep track of how busy the dance floor is so its a free for all. 

The drinks... I mean $18 for a glass of wine? Terrible tasting wine at that.. I couldnt believe it. After growing up in Las Vegas when we go out we expect to pay big money for drinks. But that is just plain ridiculous. After a few rounds I decided to switch to water because I was the DD. I went to the bartender and asked for a glass of water. He pulls out a small Fiji bottle and said that will be $16. I thought he was joking... After a few seconds of realizing he wasnt I told him i wanted just a cup of water. He refused, said they only had bottled. 

Im not cheap, Andy and I spend ridiculous money on ridiculous things but I just couldnt talk myself into spending $16 on 9oz of water. So I tried to leave the club to go grab a water at the outside bar and I was informed that if I left there was no re-entry until 2am. This was only midnight... 

I came back to our little spot and tried to enjoy the rest of our night. Then this happened... So in full disclosure Andy and I tend to get a little handsy when weve been drinking. Nothing inappropriate and nothing I wouldnt do in front of my own mother but we like to play around. When we were kissing a bouncer came over and told us to stop. I seriously could not believe what I was hearing. We were sharing just a simple kiss, nothing like insane or anything and this dude has the nerve to come over and tell us to knock it off.

Bigger DJ nights, forget it, I won't survive. I would get squashed like an ant.

My experience here wasn't bad at all, I somehow made my way to a table on the top floor off the balcony right in the center to have the clearest view of the DJ. I just thought wow, if this hasn't happened to me the night, I don't think I would have even a slight good time.

Cons:
1. I did not see where 100k million went. Not one comment here states a wow factor or innovation in clubbing or experience. It's new, nice m good sound and 80k sqft does not count. It's going to cost way to much money to maintain every month with such a high maintenance interior.

2. After partying in Europe,Hong Kong,Dubai, Mexico and South America my expectations were high on this place.

a.I expected a zen\/feng shui outdoor lounge to chill with a different experience on each floor or room. A floor similar to the ""Box"" in NYC, another floor like Thailand's BED, a main area like Privledge in Ibizia. An afterhours only like Drais. State of the art LCD interactive dancefloor, shark tanks,holograms,projections and optical illusions. Pool. More of an Asian theme.
b. State of the Art technology for bottle service and admission. We still use paper and stamps? 
c. They said it was a eco friendly green LEED building with lush interior landscaping. I doubt if this is 100% eco friendly designed and operated and did not see all the secret gardens.

Pros:
1. Sicked DJ lineup. I'm sure is not free.
2. There's going to be a restaurant to eat. I love food.
3. Hakkasan is a brand known worldwide.

The ease of entering was quick and convenient. We didn't even have to wait in line. In fact, right when the nightclub opened, we were whisked away by a bouncer and an acquaintance (that works at Hakkasan) whom both led us behind the ropes ahead of every person that was waiting in line. That was some awesome personal service right there. ID's were checked and hands were stamped twice as we were all led to an elevator that surprisingly was large enough to fit our big group.

Excited and unaware of what floor level we were being whisked away to, all I remember was how we simply navigated through the crowds to get to our booth which was conveniently located between the entrance to this room and the bar. Hip hop music was being spun and as soon as we got to our booth, the servers and hostesses began preparing the table for what would be a long night of heavy drinking, non stop dancing and everything in between. 

We were given 40 drink tickets to use at the bar on top of what we already had at our table. As time progressed, the crowd grew larger, but it didn't stop our group from having a good time. The music was good all throughout the night and by the tail end of it, I was dancing away on top of granite tables along the center booths because the constant drinking and good music on rotation that night was too good to ignore. Our server was on top of her game always making sure our drinks were filled. Every time I would try to pour a drink for myself, the server would take the drink from me and say ""I'll take care of it. What would you like?"". Let's just say, she got a good tip that night. 

Grabbing a drink at the bar was never a hassle. Every single time I approached the bar, the bartender was always attentive. I never had to wait in line to order despite how busy it seemed around that area. The restrooms are decent and were conveniently located near the entrance to the room. This club is definitely spacious with different rooms to wander through and explore. I'm glad we all decided to go here instead of XS. I know everyone's experience is different and honestly, I really wasn't expecting much even after hearing all the good things about this club, but after having experienced VIP bottle service at other clubs in Vegas, I'd have to say Hakkasan reigns supreme over the rest. The DJ's, the music, the spacious venue, restaurant, the nice bouncers, servers, bartenders and elevator dudes, our acquaintance and even the crowd definitely made this experience memorable!! Thanks for the hooks homie! You know who you are! Good positive vibes all around!",1,1,2

If i could give this ""club"" zero stars I would.  Hakkason missed the mark big time.  Was just there last Friday night to see Calvin Harris.   My wife and I have been to every big club in Vegas, and this was our worst experience.  As regular EDM listeners and Vegas fans, we were super disappointed in every aspect at ""Hakkashit"".

Like 90% of all the other Yelp reviews, I have nothing new to add, just want reinforce that this club is made to make the maximum amount of money in the shortest time.  If you don't have a super-over priced table, then don't plan on having a place to stand or set up camp.  For example, here are the table prices as quoted by one of the shady-assed ""promotors"":

Pavilion 2K-3500$ 
Mezzanine\/Skyboxes 2500-4K$
4th row 3500-4500$
3rd row 5-6K$+ 
2nd row 6K-10K$ 
1st row 10K$ 
Owners 10K$+ 
Stages 10K$ 
LLC 1K-2500$
Lounge 1K$+ 
Goes up with bigger DJs like Hardwell and Tiesto. 

It's really too bad that the best DJs are contracted there, thus giving the audience the short end of the stick.  Hakkaslum better change their style for Omnia unless they want to embarrass themselves once again on Yelp.",8,4,1

Everything else though was either meh or downright irritating.

Out of all of the clubs I have been to I have never seen such attentive staff! We bought our tickets for Hakkasan online during pre-sale and printed them via email. We were pleased to find out that the club was directly behind the gold MGM lion and easy to find. We checked our coats at the coat check ($5 on the 30th and $10 on the 31st - which we expected since things are more expensive on actual New Years Eve) and then waited in line to present our tickets. One staff member scanned our tickets and then another staff member checked our IDs and then stamped our wrists. Once more before actually entering the club you get another stamp (I'm not really sure what the double stamps are for but I didn't mind it). You can either take the elevator (Ladies - if you are wearing heels take the elevator!) or walk up the stairs. The main stage for Hakkasan is on the 4th floor and has a lot of space dedicated to VIP areas. As some of the other reviews have stated they will not let you sit or even hover next to the VIP areas. We found a spot at the top of the handicap ramp which has glass panels - this gave me a great view of the stage and also had a little shelf to hold our drinks (if you want this spot you have to get there early though!). The DJs we saw were both excellent and were more of a show than just a DJ set - dancers, acrobats dangling from the ceiling (very Cirque du Soleil), confetti, balloons - it was so cool! I'm not sure what it's like on an ""average"" night but we were so entertained. The main dance floor gets super crowded and drinks are expensive ($10 for a corona, $18 for a vodka tonic and $8 for a baby sized bottled water), also the DJ's don't go on until super late (Hardwell went on at 1:30am and Calvin Harris right after midnight), but overall we had a good time and would go again.",0,0,1

Let's start from the beginning.  I was able to get on the guest list, not because I'm cool (I actually really am though), but because it was a Thursday and there were heaps of promoters spinkled up and down the strip.  I felt quite special walking into the club and bypassing the regular folks.

For all the hype, this place was a lot smaller than what I imagined.  It appeared to me that there was one main dance floor, one off to the side, and an upstairs area suitable for some restricted dancing but mostly standing.

I've been to Hakkasan twice.  Once in the winter and there was plenty of room.  Again, in the middle of July.  The place was insanely overcrowded.  I'm not a fan of the layout.  It's all indoors unlike XS and Surrender.  So all the smoke accumulates.  The layout did not allow an efficient flow of traffic.  Also, beware of the security guards at both ends of the dance floor.  Once, the dance floor is flooded, they won't allow party goers in.

For some CONS: Like at every club, prepare to get your a$$ grabbed (even if you don't even have one). Drinks are expensive here.

Just find a promoter. So the problem Hakkasan has is that there should be 2 different guestlist lines: one for general guestlist and another for girls only! It's pretty self-explanatory; the guys are there to meet some ladies (right!?), and if all the girls are in line for an hour, how are they supposed to meet them???

If you want to make it to the dance floor, Hakkasan sure makes your work for it. There are stairs on top of stairs to get to the dance floor. Once you do get there, there's a good chance you're going to feel like you're part of a herding cattle on a farm. It gets super crowded!

Fri no table and tried to hang out upstairs. There is absolutely nowhere to stand upstairs that allows you to see the DJ. Unless you have a balcony front table, there is NO view. We eventually found an abandoned balcony table and hung there for a couple of hours, but otherwise would have been a wasted night.

For Sat we had a great table. We were on a nice little elevated area of the floor so we could see the DJ perfectly. However, all the tables below us were looking through all of the people standing up on their tables ahead of them. Not a great set up for them. I would have been furious if I had been sat there.

Table service was good, but at $5-7k, I would expect so, and not a reason to rate anyone very highly.

The layout left a lot to be desired. The hallways in and out of the club were tiny, and fit only 1-2 people wide. Why?? The walkway to the bathroom from our table required us to walk through an area between the bar and a railing which was about 6 feet wide, and had no security to keep people moving. So, that entire half of the club was stuck walking through a congested little walkway. Why??  

Plus, no outdoor access from the club.  Having been to Marque and XS I would recommend those over HK by a moderate margin. Worth seeing, but without any outdoor space to break up the evening, you're stuck inside what feels like a cramped space.

The downstairs hip hop room (3rd floor) was just OK.  Went to the Ling Ling Lounge also on the 3rd floor, but it was pretty small feeling, again with no outdoor spaces.

The main floor is similar to Marquee, but just bigger.  The DJ is in the middle with the dance floor, VIP tables, and walk way circling around it.  Thankfully the night I went wasn't as crazy so we were able to get in and out of the dance floor with no problem.

There are a lot of ramps and small steps with narrow hallways so I can easily see those being a problem (choke points) when it nears capacity.

There was NO WHERE (like a patio or anything) for people to smoke. Yes, I understand its Vegas and there are smokers everywhere....but come on people...when your dancing like crazy and every deep breath of fresh air I need to take is a big puff of smoke is not a fun environment. At least at XS or Marques, there are outside pool areas for you to get some fresh air and people tend to smoke there (as the stupid smokes get to escape somewhere!) and NOT smoking on the dance floor?! Pretty much, they didn't even need a fog machine because the stupid smoke probably did the job for them.

I even saw a guy accidentally bumped into a girl while smoking and burned her skin. That is definitely a fight waiting to happen.

To top it off, there are definitely no where to SIT. I know majority of the clubs are strict with taking off your shoes, no falling asleep etc but many clubs wouldn't care much if you sat on corner of big plant pot, the big speakers etc. These bouncers would literally pull you up before i even sat down.

Place is way too small, overpriced (if I had to pay) and no outside patio. Will never go back.

Addendum: Many have raved about the club because of popular DJ lineups and shiny lights, which is true.

We had had a pretty hardxcore night before at Marquee, but we were still dressed to the 9's and ready to party (except me haha). Anyway, we get in around like.. 10pm, which is super early (thanks, ""guestlist"" line) but it started to fill up super quickly. 

First of all, I had heard people call it ""hakka-stairs"" and I was not prepared for what came next. Those stairs to the club are ridiculous. Each step is so high and there are so many of them, more than Marquee!! Trekking up in those killer pumps was a work out. By the time I got upstairs, I was panting (out of shape.. I know).

Upon getting to the top of the stairs, I saw more stuff.. a bar on the left, a cage thing in front of me.. It was a bit underwhelming. Then I saw the dance floor. Sure, there were tons of lights and video screen thingies, which made for a nice party ambience, but the dance floor itself was so small. Even the walkways to the dance floor were sucky. They were too much of a slope and it wasn't easy to walk in heels.

The upstairs also a smoking area, which is not cool. I really don't like the fact that there's no outdoor area. Of course, there's A\/C but with that many people, it gets hot! The ""hip hop"" room was also a joke. It's basically all tables and booths, no dance floor, but people try to dance anyway. It's a horrific experience even for non-claustrophobic people.

Girls, for all you first timers - do your homework before you head to the strip. You should be paying NOTHING when you go to the club, despite how hyped up the club is or which artist is playing - there is always a way. 

During my Bachelorette weekend, the IT club that we had to go to was Hakkasan. Located in MGM, Hakkasan has received a lot of popularity recently being pretty new and having a variety of popular EDM DJs performing. With the help of some scoping on Instagram and asking around we were able to get connected with a promoter who placed us on the VIP list to get in. 

Here's the thing about going clubbing on a 3 day weekend where everyone and their mom has decided that they want to go to Vegas - it's crowded as shit! So make sure you come early and that you won't mind getting your shoes stepped on and getting consistently bumped and groped (both intentionally and unintentionally) by strangers. And for clubs like Hakkasan make sure you arrive a lot earlier than the allotted times so you make sure you can actually get in before cut off time. 

Upon entering Hakkasan, we found ourselves faced with a series of stairs. The club itself was not that large but rather it was a bunch of rooms stacked on top of each other. Stairwells are dark and steep and there are no signs that indicate what each level holds. They have an elevator but the areas are poorly marked and getting into one was almost as hard as getting into the club itself. Keep your ears peeled they do have a decent hip hop room. 

Let me emphasize again how tiny the venue was, there was a point in the night that we were standing still in the middle of the crowd because there was just not where to go - no possible movement. Based on other venues there was nothing that really stood out about decor either, yeah you had your booths and tables and dance floors, but that's really about it. If you have a good DJ you'll hear a great set but nothing really to fawn over. 

My biggest pet peeve of the night was the amount of people lighting up, great cool you're a smoker but is it really necessary to be blowing your smoke in an already crowded and hot area? I was terrified walking around the club seeing butts everywhere in fear that I would get side swiped by their firey ends. 

Yeah, not a fan. Overly hyped venue, maybe worth a revisit once the hype dies down and the crowd moves on to the next shiny toy.",4,5,2

The music is pumping, bodies gyrating ang lights a flashing.  If your late, good luck getting to the dance floor. You will spend most of your time walking around the aisles trying to get a peek at the DJ from the bar areas on the left or the right.

There's a bit more space to the right where there's more standing areas that are slightly elevated.  Drinks are standard $15 and tiny Fiji water for $9. You can't get a tap water here so don't bother asking.  The club is 70% table service with the expensive ones closer to the floor.  If you got a cheaper one near the side bars forget about seeing the dance floor as its tiered and people standing on each level.

The aisles and bars take up another 20% and dance floor 10%.  It's a nice club, but it's geared towards maxing revenue and not comfort where you can move around freely like XS with there outdoor area.  People smoke inside, but the AC works pretty good.  

They have the best DJs now but you will enjoy the music and not see your guy mixing unless your crammed on the dance floor like a sardine.  

Your only retreat will be the ling  ling room downstairs but now your on a difft level.  Not my favorite club, but might come back. Be sure and get a presale ticket to avoid the long GA line.",4,0,2

Tommy Trash was the DJ of the night.

Got in free... I don't remember how...But we did. Got to ride in the elevator to go up and from there, there are stairs. The security are nice but don't mistake one for a random guy that wants to hold your hand.

Drinks are expensive. Already learned that you should PREGAME. Water = $9, WHAT? And no they do not offer a cup of water.

If I remember correctly there's two to three floors. To get access to their stage you need another wristband. With the DJ playing there's a block off like a concert with security guards making sure nobody passes that line.

Loved the lights and there were dancers! They had cool outfits on but I couldn't see much since I'm tiny.

I got stamped and walked into a very cool spot. There's not really a bad spot anywhere to watch the performers, and there's lots of lounge and seating area. It's an excellent venue to be at as the sound was awesome and enough bar areas open to accommodate our group so that you aren't waiting long to get a drink.

I go to Vegas 5 times a year and have tried to go to Hakkasan for 5 times now and kept not going for one reason or another. I knew there's no seating so I wanted to only go if we got a table. Got a table through Greg Baker, who had some tables available (I guess since it was a Sunday) and got us a reduced min of $1K which I wasn't going to pass up. He had offered us a table for $1K the night before for Tiesto too which I really wanted to take, but we were committed to XS already. 
Getting in was kind of a bitch because the table line isn't so much a line as people trying to get the attention of two people with clipboards to let them in, or other people slipping money to get in faster. Luckily I called Greg and he came and got me. Note: They won't let you in without everyone there.
We went up an elevator to the main floor and lead to our table. We got a bottle of Belvedere for like $500 or something, a few Bud Lights, redbulls and waters for the table. The music was really loud, but we were in the main room so what can you expect? 
The service here was amazing. The security guards wouldn't accept tips but were looking out for us nonstop. The guy who was working with our waitress to clear the table, bring us more juice, empty ashtrays, etc was impeccable. We gave him some extra money at the end of the night because he was really impressive. Every time we used some juice, we got a new bottle, every time we ashed a cigarette the ash tray was emptied. Kudos for finding such an awesome guy. 
Our neighbors to the left were from SF like us and really nice. Our neighbors to the right were an Abercrombie model and Jessica Simpson's dad, so there's that. lol
At around 3, they closed our section off and moved us to the top floor of the main room to a very large table where we took all our new friends including a lovely older brittish couple who gave my friend $100 for a wedding present. Security thought we were selling them drugs at first and were shining flash lights on us, but we got it sorted. 
The sound and lights here are amazing. I had to go over the productions guys running the boards and tell them. Security was really nice and let me go over to them and tell them myself. Bathrooms were really clean here as well. They had girls going silk too which was awesome to watch.
Above and Beyond was of course amazing. I can't wait to come back.",0,0,0

I went the night Tiesto was playing, and the line to get into Hakkasan wasn't too bad, maybe less than 30 minutes but of course we got there maybe an hour before Tiesto took the stage. The lines are just beginning.

There are a couple different floors inside Hakkasan. There's a chiller one where you actually have room, and then there's the main one. I'm not a huge fan of the layout of the main floor because it's so small. (On the plus side, I guess that means everyone is relatively close to the DJ...? The DJ is so high up that my friends had to put me on their shoulders for me to see Tiesto's whole face, haha.) They block off a decent amount of it on one side to serve as space for a line, and it's so hard to squeeze in and out of the dance floor since everyone has to get in and out on one side. So if you dance on that one side of the dance floor, people will always be trying to get past you. I think they leave a decent amount of room for tables in the back.

Also, there's nowhere to put your drinks on the dance floor, so everyone puts them on the ground. Thanks for being very considerate. Since it gets so packed, they sometimes spray cold gas at us. Thank goodness... It gets hard to breathe for us short ones!

They sell foldable flats inside the women's restroom, which is awesome. I got yelled at a bunch of times for walking without heels because they don't want you to step on glass.",1,0,0

I took my wife to see Tiesto last night and we had a bit of a rough experience. It was her first Vegas club. We had no idea the main venue was on the top floor until 3 hours into the night when I started getting the hunch we were in the wrong place. I even asked a bouncer if we were in the right spot for Tiesto and he said, ""yes, he should be on shortly."" 

After realizing Tiesto was upstairs around 2:30 we tried to salvage the night as best we could. 
THERE IS ZERO SPACE FOR DANCING. Unless you have a table, you'll have a rough experience. There's too many people and it's difficult to get a view of the DJ. Bouncers constantly make you move out of the way because there's nowhere for the general admission ticket holders to go.

I understand that working in a bar\/club isn't easy, especially when the owner is packing in too many people and has bad practices. 

The girls I was with got thirsty and wanted water. We had been dancing and drinking and sweating. They won't give you tap water. $10 for a 12 ounce bottle of water. I understand thing being a little more expensive on the strip, I've lived here my whole life, but that is ridiculous. When I go to ask for a cup of ice for our $10 water the bartender stated in a very rude tone ""you mean the $10 water you didn't buy."" This is the 21st century, I am a gay man, and women don't need a man to buy them a drink. If he were a gentleman he could have been nicer about refusing us one tap water. Granted I can understand not being happy serving customers who aren't nice but we said ""please and thank you"" and tipped nicely to all our servers who were less than spectacular.

Then when we are going back to dance, one of the workers slides in front of me and I have to do everything to stop myself from bumping into him. When I do bump him he gets a mad look on his face and complains to a bouncer who was actually decent enough to realize when you pack 500 people into a space meant for maybe 200, and you include alcohol, people are going to be bumping into people. 

Of all the clubs I've visited, this is the worst experience I've ever had. The drinks are expensive everywhere on the strip but the staff at most other places actually practice hospitality. The sexist nature of this place is appalling. I have never been to a club where being on the guest list meant that guys still had to pay cover; not a big deal I had originally planned to get in paying full price, but my friend got us on the guest list so I saved $10. I will not visit any more clubs or restaurants owned by this group.",0,0,0

Definitely a go-to club whenever in Vegas. Like most clubs, be sure to be put on a guest list and DRESS UP. You get bumped up when you do both. We didn't have to wait in line for so long as they kept moving us up. For guys: no sneakers, only dress shoes.",1,0,0

One of the friends got some hookup so we didn't pay to get in and VIP line pass. So couldn't complain about paying a cover charge or waiting forever in a line. The club itself is pretty huge. We surveyed about 3 floors. The look was pretty cool throughout. The house DJ list is impressive too. Tiesto, Calvin Harris, Steve Aoki & Deadmau5. Each floor having its own decor, theme & DJs. Two serious downsides were that it was packed like a sardine can in there. Also the stairs are KILLER. There's only a few elevators so the main route of travel inside the club is taking flights of stairs. I can imagine it's even more a nightmare when one is drunk & wearing high heels. Frankly I'm shocked no ones gotten seriously hurt and\/or sued Hakkasan for dangerous conditions.
One person is our group did lose her purse. When she called the next day, fortunately they had it at the club intact. Apparently she had left it at one of the bars after ordering some drinks & the bartender saw it and turned it in.

We went into the lounge part of the club, which was nice and not overly loud. We could hear our group talking and we had a nice time. The bartenders (at the bar) in this  section were SUPER professional. He realized that we were a large group and introduced himself by name. Unlike other Vegas nightclub bartenders, he actually seemed to care that we were there spending $20\/drink. Nice touch.

Weeks prior to our bachelorette Vegas trip, we met with a promoter who provided us details to get in for free at the club. There may have been a drink requirement but I am not sure. 
We were told the club opened at midnight and arrived in line at 11:30 pm. We were expecting to get in, but the promoter told us that unfortunately we would have to wait anywhere from 1 to 2 hours.
We did skip a few lines to the guest entrance which was a much quicker move. However, we waited about 2.5 hrs before getting to the entrance. 
Just when we thought we would be able to get in, we were told it would be $60 entrance. Apparently ""being on the list"" ended at 10 pm...

One of my friends had made sure we were on a guest list ahead of time. She had even confirmed it earlier in the day but when we arrived they couldn't find it anyway. The girl who was checking us in couldn't have made it more obvious if she tried that she didn't believe us. Gave a bad first impression before we even got in the door. We ended up getting out of line to figure out what we wanted to do and another doorman ended up letting us in.

The idea of Hakkasan is actually pretty cool. It's a 5 story club with different music styles on each floor. The novelty wears off pretty quickly though when you realize it's just a big club. The top floor (where the main dance floor is) was so crowded you could barely move. Everything is blocked off by VIP fences leaving only 2 ways to get on and off the dance floor. It made me somewhat nervous about what would happen in an emergency.

The middle floor was much better. The music was easier to dance to and it was less crowded. However, drinks on all floors were super expensive. Needless to say, I was happy to call it a night before last call.",2,1,1

The lines are always ridiculously long, even with a group of 10+ cute girls.  The service is definitely lacking.  On the plus side, it's really easy to get on a VIP list because they have SO many promoters everywhere you go.  But still, the flow of the club is just not the greatest and the stage is really small.    When you actually go for a big DJ performance, they don't usually come on until about 2:30 am and by that time, I'm tired, or we drank too much already, or I just don't care anymore.  That same scenario happened the last time I was there for Steve Aoki and for ATB on another trip.  There's also no outdoor space, which kind of kills it for me.  Unlike at XS or Marquee, there's space to wander and get some fresh air - you're not just stuck in one super overcrowded room like at Hakkasan.

Staff:  From Security, the bartenders, waitresses and hosts.  Everyone has been professional and has given me first class treatment.   It seems like if you're nice to the staff and personnel there, they were more than happy to go above and beyond in customer service.  Regardless, everyone I've encountered has been great.  The staffing levels were effective in ensuring a great experience for everyone.

Headliners:  I've seen Calvin Harris, Hardwell and Tiesto there a couple of times.  The Big Name Resident DJs won't come on until later.  1:30 AM would be considered early for them coming on.  The Sets and the experiences have been fantastic.  Sound and lighting seem to work well with whomever is showcased.

Venue Setup:  The main room where the DJs are showcased can get crowded quickly but it's just big enough to hold enough people for an intimate concert that would be hard to find anywhere else.  There are many levels with lots of stairs.  Ladies please be careful with your heels.  The Ling Ling room is a nice little get away when you actually have to have a conversation with someone.

Price: I'm fortunate enough to not have to worry about the entry but most people I know pay $50  at the door.  I've heard entry as high $100 on some nights.  Beers are about $12, Shots & drinks at $15.  This is not the night club to go on a budget on.   Treat this like a bachelor\/bachelorette party mindset in Vegas:  It's going to cost some $$$ but it's better to throw down the money for a good time versus not to.  If you want to frequent Hakkasan without having to spend some money, just like any other place in Vegas or life in general, it's all about networking.

Summary:  It's the most popular nightclub in Vegas with the best mega resident DJs with high end appeal.  To expect it to be anything else would set you up for a disappointing evening.  I'm not there every weekend but I'm there to see my favorite DJs and I have yet to be disappointed with the experience.",4,1,1

We went on a night they had 3 floors blocked off, so we listened to house\/trance music the whole time(not my first choice) it would have been okay if they actually had a place to dance. The whole club is just vip area and the dance floor the size of my bathroom, by 11:15 you could barely fist pump without hitting 2 people.

I'll give credit where credit is due - the light show\/lasers in the main room are production heavy and give Hakkasan some credibility.   Also, the DJ in the hip hop room was on point last night, throwing down hit after hit!  You could tell the crowd was really into it (and even some of the bouncers couldn't stop dancing).  

Cons:
- Ladies, the elevators are reserved for bottle service patrons only.  This means you'll have to walk up four flights of stairs to get to the main level, and walk back down four flights of stairs to exit.  
***TAKE NOTE:  I made a comment to the bouncer at the elevator that making girls in 5 inch heels walk so many stairs to get out is not the business, and, I kid you not, he told me ""WEAR FLATS NEXT TIME"".  Are you for real??   I've told this story at least 10x in the past 12 hours and you can bet I'll keep telling it until your employees learn to show some class.
- I didn't buy any drinks last night but my guy friends did.  Expect to pay $18.50 for a Redbull Vodka.
- This club is probably 20% walk way\/dance foor, 30% stairs, and 50% tables.  Everywhere you look, there are tables upon tables.  I get this is the kind of clientele you're trying to attract, but frankly I found it to be total overkill, especially since so many of the tables went empty.

I had an 8am flight to catch this morning and initially, I was bummed I'd have to leave early to catch some sleep.  Then I actually experienced the club first-hand and was quite grateful to have an excuse to leave well before Laidback Luke even got on.  My friends didn't have the same early-flight excuse but left shortly after I did.

Our first night at Hakkassan: 
We started our bachelorette weekend off with a show that got out really late and we wanted to try out Hakkassan since it's new! Our promoter, Kevin Lee, was super accommodating! He got us into the club at 1:30am right when everything was popping without any delay. We tried the main floor that was EDM, but gave up since it was waaaaay too packed. We moved to the hip hop room which surprisingly wasn't packed even thought it was smaller than the main floor. The music was good and the crowd was fun. 

Our second night at Hakkassan: 
We decided to come back again since we had a good time the other night. We got on the guestlist and as we got in line, a girl approached us asking us to join their table since they wanted to get the ratio of girls up. She told us we didn't have to wait in line or pay for bottle service, we just had to go with them. I looked at the line in front of us and said, ""hell yeah"". I should have known it was too good to be true. As we got out of the guestlist line, a manager came up to ask us who's guestlist we were on and when did the girl ask us to join their group. I didn't know what was going on, so I was honest about it. 

We met with the couple who had asked to join them and sh!t hit the fan! The manager was chewing out the couple of stealing guests out of the line and etc. We had no idea what was going on and was told to go back to the guestlist line by a different host. We already had plans to get bottle service somewhere else but just wanted to do a little bit of club hopping first. It was not worth it for us to get back in line so we decided to leave. Another bouncer\/manager saw that we were leaving and came over to us. He got us checked in and we skipped the regular line.  

He explained that the couple were locals and were getting paid to help promote the club by bringing in guests. The manager was upset because the couple stole guests off another promoter's guestlist when they asked us to join their group.

Despite the fact that HS' design isn't very innovative and one of the main hallways reeked of incense (good looking out on 4\/20 I guess), my first night at Hakksan was an excellent one because everyone from the staff to the patrons was unbelievably nice, to the point where it started getting creepy. Within ten minutes of getting past the horrendous line outside (one of the few downsides), the following happened:

1) Every bartender at one of the bars on the EDM floor proactively introduced themselves to me (which, by the way, was only possible because they didn't pack the place to the point where it felt like I was on a train car full of refugees seeking political asylum like they do at a certain club whose name rhymes with the word 'Narquee').

2) A bouncer decided to give my friends and me a mini-tour of the main entranceway and provided a detailed verbal layout of the place for us to follow.

3) A random patron decided to buy my group a round of drinks just because (and I didn't wake up the next morning in the desert sans pants).

4) Some big Mexican dude who resembled UFC heavyweight champ Cain Velasquez kept checking in on me to make sure I was having a good time and had enough space as I aggressively elbowed him in the back of the head every third fist pump or so (and it didn't seem like he was being sarcastic).

The interior layout of the club is pretty spectacular.  Their lounge booths are humongous.  Amazed how many of us were able to sit in; plus there was a table big enough to accommodate a mini bar like set up.  So is this living life to its' fullest?

I liked that we were able to lounge.  They play my kind of music.  I know people who enjoy their music preference they love to blast it.  Fergie DJ played the kind I could drown away with.  No thinking just loving the beat.  Being in the energy, but at the same time relaxing on the same level with the sounds.

There was a laser light show and balloons interactive.  Made the atmosphere feel really fun!  Even with the music volume and pretending you can hear the people trying to talk to you, the environment allows for people watching.  A magician came to the booth and turned a paper rose into a real one.  That was cool.  I think the lighting effects helped his performance.

The night had to end at some point. And yes, with age the ringing in the ears becomes prominent hahaaa!  A great concept they have to dine, drink, and dance.  Hakkasan Nightclub recommended for the young at heart - no matter what age, if you can bare it!",35,24,28

We were all stoked because we thought it was super cool that there was an area for EDM and hip hop.
All in all we had a fantastic night celebrating and dancing on the 'ratchet floor' but once we went to the main area (EDM stage), things went down hill extremely quickly..

1) The EDM area was EXTREMELY crowded. We were all packed in there.
2) My girlfriends got their phones stolen and all my cash was gone within 30 min being in that area. 

It makes me sad because from what I am reading here, it's not an uncommon event at Hakkasan. It makes me more sad that I'm sure they read these reviews and have not upped the security in there. I hope they try to work this situation out with security management because I really do want to come back here because I thought the light work and sound was amazing in this club.

But until then, I will be exploring other options:",5,1,1

The staff we've encountered were unprofessional and carried this attitude as if they were better than anyone.  Two things happened this night that has left such a bad lasting impression that I will probably never set foot there again and spend a dime there and that is all because of the staff.

First incident - We all bought presale tickets.  My sister wasn't able to go so my friend bought the ticket off her and had the email confirmation printed out.  The girl who was checking tickets accused my friend of hacking into the account to get my sister's ticket.  Seriously?  Who says that?  We had the confirmation with my friend's name transferred on there and it clearly matches her ID and the girl was being so rude we talked to another girl who noticed the situation and basically told us to not mind that girl and took one look at the ticket and let my friend in without question.

Second Incident - The ""head of security"", I believe his name is ""Chris"", checked my boyfriend's ID and took one look and said ""that's not you, you can't go in.""  My boyfriend is turning 30 this year.  Yes, his ID picture was taken in high school and he looks darker and a bit skinnier in his ID but his face structure and everything looks just like him.  We tell the security that we can tell you the information on the ID and even showed other credit cards with my boyfriend's name on it and the guy simply responded ""I can take someone's ID and remember their information in 10 minutes too.""  We told him we wanted to escalate to the manager and he said he is the manager, which is complete bull because no manager would have let this happen.  He wouldn't even give him a chance so we went and asked 5 other security guards if the ID looks like him and all agreed.  We went back to the ""head of security"" and said we just asked 5 other people that works here and they all said it looks like him--why are YOU the only one giving us a hard time?  And he said ""because it's not him in the ID.""  Are you kidding me?  Who do you think you are?  We were so shocked and upset that we didn't even want to go in anymore so we asked for a refund.  He would not give us a refund and said we had to get it online which is also complete bull and then completely turned his head and started chatting with his friend as if we didn't exist.

Absolutely terrible.  I'm in awe.  As upset as I am though, I do not wish Hakkasan failure--I hope management reads this review so they realize their staff is mistreating customers with utmost disrespect and belittling them and train their staff to be more professional and respectful.  Try getting some tips from Surrender because that's where we went the following night and honest to God, have never been more impressed with their level of customer service.",18,0,0

I was escorted to the VIP ropes where security carefully scanned and searched for contraband. I was hand stamped and shown to another line, where I was stamped with a different marking.  

I waited with other invited guests and wished up to the club. As the doors parted, the rhythm of house music pounded and greeted me with pulsating blue lights. 

I was a bit overwhelmed with a underdressed Millennial crowd. Guys, you'd think with all the single women in shimmering dresses you'd try to look your best. 

Tables take up most of the space and there's not really any bar seating. On the second floor it's a bit more sedate, which I was able to hang around an older crew.

Hakkasan Nightclub
- Big Pros: big name DJs, huge place, different rooms\/music options, free seating in the Ling Ling Lounge, cool staff, decent ratio of about 45% women:55% men, their restaurant downstairs.
- Big Cons: no outdoor area (XS, Tryst, Marquee, Chateau...have nice outdoor sections), needs better signage (stairs\/the maze didn't bother me but I would like to know I'm walking in the right direction), small dance floor

- Had a men's $50 pre-sale tix (+ $5 LET (local entertainment tax) + $7.50 service fee so it really came out to total about $63).  A few days before the event the $50 tix were sold out and only the men's pre-sale tix $75 (+ LET + service fee) were available.
- Doors opened at 9:45 so I arrived at the pre-sale tix line about 9:40 pm.  In a quick 10 minutes or so I got my 2 club stamps and entered the club.  I asked a coupla bouncers about re-entry policy and one told me no re-entry that night, another told me no re-entry once the club got full (which would definitely happen with Calvin playing on a Sat).
- Since I didn't want to hassle with Nightclub re-entry I hung out at the restaurant\/bar from about 10:15 pm - 12:20 am for dinner & drinks.  I took the elevator from the nightclub to the restaurant\/bar.  Restaurant's Ketel One & seltzer was only $12 whereas at the Nightclub a small bottle of Fiji is already $9.  Also they had a special $50.14 menu supporting charity going on and that included a 4-course dinner.
- After dinner\/drinks at the restaurant I walked up 2 flights of stairs to the Ling Ling Lounge (free seating with no mandatory bottle service), showed my club stamps to the bouncer to continue on to the Ling Ling Club, then finally got to the Nightclub. 
- Since I didn't have the $3,500 minimum for a table and the dancefloor packed, I just stood\/danced on the periphery with the other riff-raff for about an hour waiting for Calvin to spin.  At 1:30 am ""Feel So Close"" came on to signal that Calvin Harris was finally spinning.  I love his music, but except for his own songs I didn't care too much for his set & choice in other songs. 

- Will be back to see Tiesto play.  Will be at XS to see Avicii play and later David Guetta.  Curious how Hakkasan+their star DJs vs XS+their star DJs compares.",3,0,0

Bought a Stella for $10 which is typical. Bartenders were prompt and friendly. Parked myself in a good spot on the main floor and enjoyed the music. Sound was great, Hardwell went hard, even the pre-dj was good. No wait at all in the ladies room which was a plus, plenty of stalls which I appreciated.

From there entry was a breeze... upon entry the club was popping off... hip hop night music and lots of private parties and confetti everywhere. Two beers cost $22. Bartender ran tab on my card.. ventured into one of the empty table areas to take a selfie with my man and was immediately told by security that we couldn't stand there lol. Then we crammed into the general area for a bit and then decided we were done so we proceeded to cash out at the bar. The bartender that took my card was busy so we asked another one that wasn't doing anything but stacking glasses for my card and he responded with total attitude stating he could not help us because he doesn't know who I am and I need to wait for the other bartender to become available. Seriously??? U ask for an id every time I used my card.. why wouldn't u look at it then and grab my card? Lazy. Bottom line is this place is awesome if you pay for table and bottle service at $1,000-5,000 a pop.

Came here Saturday June 15 and it was the worst experience. Megan from the guestlist line lacks professionalism and should be fired from her job.  She made us get in a 1 hour long line after I first asked her when we arrived when we first arrived to see if we are on her list otherwise we will just pay the full price ticket. She said we have to get in line before she will look to see if we are on the list.  After waiting 1 hour, we arrive to the front of her line for her to tell us that we are not on the list and we need to get in the regular line.  What a waste of time!  

Then we get to the regular line and they charge $50 for guys and $30 for girls.  I didn't mind paying that but I wish we didn't have to wait into 2 separate lines.  When I asked the cashier and management if they knew Megan at the guestlist line, I was told that they do not know everyone by name.  Really?

Most people didn't want to join me at LIGHTS where Zedd performed the day before but LIGHTS at Mandalay bay is hands down a waaaay better club than Hakkasan.  After partying in many of the worlds top party destinations I have to say that this billionaire owner of Hakkasan tried too hard to make a great venue but he needs to work on the kind of people they hire first.

Hakkasan announced their resident DJs lineup which includes: Tiesto, Deadmau5, Calvin Harris, Dada Life, Hardwell, and of course my favorite Laidback Luke, to name a few...

Tables\/bottle service for Hakkasan is INSANE! We were quoted 6g's in their hip hop room and 8 - 10g's in their main room. NO THANKS!... With that ridiculous price range, we initially noticed that about 90% of the tables\/bottle service booths were EMPTY! 

Anyway, GA admission for guys was about $60 and I believe it was $30 for girls! We arrived to the club early since it was their grand opening weekend and didn't wanna deal with long lines! This night club is HUGE! I thought it was only 3 floors, but we were told by one of their bouncers that it was actually 5 floors! They have elevators that are pretty organized that will take you to each floor if you wanna avoid the endless stairs *AHEM MARQUEE*

The club itself is pretty nice! Their dance floor for each rooms were a bit small compared to XS\/Marquee, since they filled each room with so many bottle service tables\/booths (THAT WERE SADLY EMPTY, LOL). But it was still easy to navigate your way in and out of the dance floor!

With that said, I'll give kudos to Hakkasan for their lightings, visuals, sound system, and stage setups! They have an amazing lineup of big name DJ's that will for sure attract the crowd! I wouldn't say this club tops XS (which is still my favorite club on the strip), but this is definitely better than Marquee since they actually have elevators!!! I get the image Hakkasan is trying to go for, but they are insane to be charging people 6 - 10 grand for a table, specially with all the other clubs on the strip like XS! 

Oh and a small bottle of fiji water is $9. And don't even ask for tap water, they don't F@%K with tap, lol WOWZA!

Our friend hooked us up with some promoter, so we got in free. They had pretty good customer service, and didn't question us about our IDs. I came in with about 10 other asian girls, and considering how we all look 17 and usually get hassled about it, they were pretty gracious. We got in early probably around 10- and even though it was still filling up and only a handful of people were there- it was already super hot and stuffy. This place probably needs better ventilation.  

There were a million stairs and it was literally a labyrinth to get out of.

After hearing so many people rave about it and being there it was not that great.  Yeah the venue is pretty nice and they have a hip hop room but it was SO crowded I couldn't really enjoy myself!

PROMOTER: I contacted Dan Stak (702-824-3234) and he was able to get me and my friends in for free! We had 2 guys and 6 girls.  He was very informative, texting me to make sure I got in the right line and answering all of my questions.  He even came to find me in line to make sure I was taken care of.  I would highly recommend him to get into Hakkasan and he got me on the guest list for Wet Republic too!

WAIT: We got in line around 9:45, the line was near Rainforest Cafe and had to first wait in a small line labeled ""guest list"" and then move over to the ""general admission"" line.  The wait was about an hour until we got into the club and it did feel long but the line moved pretty quickly.  They checked our IDs and gave us stamps ahead of time and checked us out on the iPads before we got in so the process was pretty seamless.

ATMOSPHERE: Once you walk in you go around to the main floor where there is a pretty big dance floor and tables surrounding it.  Go further and into the ""ling ling club"" which is where the hip hop music is.  The dance floor is TINY and although it was super dead when we first got there I could see how it was going to get super packed by the time everyone got in.  The drinks are expensive and only OK, and they charge you for water!!  Another sucky thing is that there is a lot of fog everywhere so pictures are horrible! They have this weird fog\/haze in them that is hard to edit out :(

Hip hop room music wasn't bad, they start out old school and then move into more modern stuff but we left around 12am to go to the EDM room to see Martin Garrix.

The EDM room seems big but is super crowded.  I found a spot and didn't want to move because it would be IMPOSSIBLE to get back into the crowd.  No room to really dance but merely stand there and maybe wave your hand if you can.  People are kinda pushy and spill drinks easily -_-.  I left at 1:30am because it just wasn't fun anymore.  

Overall, if you want to check it out to say you've been there maybe wait until it dies down some.  The venue is really pretty and nice but it's just so crowded so you don't have space to even enjoy the good hip hop music.",5,0,0

To be honest, I had a lot more fun this time around versus the first two times I've been here. I love the hiphop floor more than the edm floor, so their hip hop floor is pretty nice. Our host for our table was extremely nice and funny, I think his name was Max but I might have forgot his name, but he was pretty cute. The hostess at our table was really helpful and sweet! So not all the staffs at Hakkasan are unfriendly!  This visit would've been a 5 ratings or even a 4 but around 2am, the bouncer kicked us out of our table because we didn't have any alcohol beverages anymore on the table, I didn't know or wasn't notified that you have to have drinks at the table at all times in order to stay there. Bummer.... Regardless of getting kicked out, things was going fine, until two of my friends lost their wallet because someone pickpocketed him. this had happen almost consistently; once this trip and another back in August.  My friend who lost her phone did not drop it because it was in her purse that was zipped up. I don't really blame Hakkasan for the thefts, since it could happen at any nightclub, but people should just be extra careful when they go to Hakkasan. Go hard for another nightclub! :)",4,6,1

It sadly was a disappointment though. My group and I got in for free with equal men to female ratio and got drinks comped because our friend knew a promoter which was nice but the experience itself killed it. The place is super small but it attracts a big crowd so expect to be stepped and pushed on the dance floor! My buzz went away within minutes. It was a nightmare to use the restroom because of the crowd as well. Music was good but it took forever (1 a.m) for the headliner (tiesto) to play. I don't see myself coming back here. I'll stick to XS!,1,0,0

Boy was I mistaken. For starters, I had bottle service for a group of about 12 people (mainly girls) and had to wait quite a while to even be taken inside because someone named Joe was unable to be found (even though he is the person I was told to ask for when I got to the table reservation line). This wasn't that big of a deal, we just wanted to get in and start our night so we did think too much of the wait. 

Once inside, we couldn't see anything in front of us. The club is SO dark and is honestly like finding your way through a maze. Not only is it difficult to maneuver your way around the club, but it's also so over-crowded that you can't take more than two steps without bumping into someone. 

We finally got to a table and the guy who I'm assuming is 'Joe' asked us for a credit card and ID. Now this is where my real frustration starts. I explained to 'Joe' that my friend (who is male) volunteered to give his card, but it is a temporary one because his actual card got stolen while we were in Vegas. He said it wouldn't be a problem, called over the host and had me order our bottles. After about 45 minutes of waiting and wondering where the hell our bottles and mixers were, a 'manager' comes over with the host and starts telling me that the card is unacceptable because it doesn't have a name on it. So I simply asked why we were not told this information when I asked earlier and he looked at me and said, ""I don't need to deal with this. I'm canceling your bottle service. You can all go back outside and pay cover to get in."" This is his response to my one little question...I think I deserved an explanation considering you're the supposed manager and YES, you actually do need to deal with this. We managed to get the money together to pay for the bottle service (which was about $3,000).

We started to enjoy our night and were having a little more fun considering the ordeal we just went through. About an hour later, we finished our bottles and the host had cleared up our table. We were all dancing around the empty table, some girls were on the table, and others were on the platform that surounds the booth seating. THIS is when the night took a turn for the worst. Not a single person came to tell the girls that they could not dance on the little empty table that once had our bottles on it, but the second my friend (the same guy who had the issue with the credit card) starts to dance on it, someone from the club walks up to him and literally PULLS him off the table. Luckily he didn't get hurt. It seemed like the entire security team had surrounded him because he apparently wasn't supposed to be dancing on that table and they thought he was going to get physical. Fortunately for the club, my friends are civil and know how to speak to people. We don't need to use force unlike the employee.

At this point, I asked to speak to a manager. Guess who the manager was? YUP, the same heavy set, hispanic man with glasses who gave us a hard time with the credit card AND who happened to be the same person to pull my friend off the table. HE is the manager? When we asked him the reasoning for doing what he did, he simply said, ""he had it coming...do you dance on your coffee table at home?"" That is the response a MANAGER of a club gives to paying patrons? NO. When asked to speak to a supervisor I was told there wasn't one working. So the only person I could speak to was the guy who thought he was in a position to physically assault someone in a club that he manages. When I said what he did was illegal, he laughed in my face. Really 'Manager'? Just for your own future reference, battery IS actually illegal. To help you further, I will be more than happy to provide you with the definition of battery under Nevada's Penal Code. NO ONE CAME TO TELL US WE COULDN'T DANCE ON THE TABLE. If we had been told, we wouldn't have done it. 

I work in the hospitality industry too and would never treat people the way this 'manager' and the rest of the employees at the night club treated my party. If I were you, I would suggest finding somewhere else to spend your money unless you like being treated like you're below the employees there. I left the club without any resolution. No one could even give me the email address or business card of the supervisor or at least SOMEONE in a higher position than the manager who had no problem laying his hands on a paying patron. Let me end this by saying that I never write reviews, but because I couldn't get an email address to express my thoughts about the poor service at this club, I just had no other option.",19,4,0

Other than that, I would have to rate my experience here as ""meh."" It was just stupid crowded everywhere you went. Like you can't walk without grinding on other people who are just standing there looking at you right in the eye making things super awkward as your balls are brushing up against their ass or something....

While trying to find a good spot to camp out where we can get an unobstructed view of the stage, we were constantly shooed away by the security guards with their flash lights like they were shooing away an annoying fly. Here's the crazy thing, there were LOTs of other people standing in places blocking doorways and walkways and they didn't shoo those other people away. Sure, shoo away the good looking people! Lol. This place is a huge fire hazard if there ever was one! 

Drinks are mad expensive, as expected of any place in Vegas that isn't in the casino. 

All in all, like other reviewers said, the experience is how you make of it. If you're going to see either Tiesto or Calvin Harris, you'll have a good time  listening to their sets, but everything else.....ehhhh I'll let you be the judge...",2,2,3

The drinks are really expensive too, cocktails around $16-$18, and a glass of champagne $22... The only good thing about this place was the decor (which reminded me of their restaurant in San Francisco), and the amount of time we waited to get in, only about 10-15 minutes considering we arrived around 11pm-12am without any promoters walking us in or special VIP\/guestlist line.

Located in the MGM Grand, it's hard to miss nowadays with the exterior of MGM Grand hotel largely displaying electronic ads for Hakkasan. Although 5 levels in total, the first two levels are actually the restaurant space. The club is located in the upper three floors, with one level being just a lounge, second being the main room with resident DJs and third having a hip hop dance room. 

I came the second weekend after it's opening debut and Calvin Harris and Fergie were featured in the main room. I prefer house music, so the main room was my favorite dance floor, however, if you like hip hop, head to the Ling Ling Lounge for some beats.

My group of ladies arrived early around 8:45\/9PM to make the guest list line (a ladies only one) and were in the club upon its doors opening at 10PM. FREE. No cover charge. Love it. Many thanks for to my gal pal who contacted the right promoter for the hook up. Also wanted to note that contrary to other Yelp reviews here, my girl friend told me we didn't have to submit our group photo in advance to be accepted on the guest list. That's so weird some patrons had to fulfill that requirement. I've never personally done this to get on other top tier Vegas nightclubs either.

Once inside, we found the club very spacious, although at that time, not many people were there yet. The dance floor in particular was hauntingly empty. Was it even open? So we proceeded to start the night with drinks at the bar. By midnight, the club filled up. The dance floor was super packed, but the ladies and I managed to get a good spot close to the front to hang out. So close we could see the DJ's expressions. Party on. The light effects were pretty amazing as well. Lazers, smoke and ever-changing neon blinking lights. On another note, I found that even though it was crowded, I didn't have a hard time getting a drink at the bar. There were enough bars around on each level to keep the bar crowd from being 10 people deep.

Overall, I had a great time, but there were some small disappointments along the way...

- Stairs everywhere. Unavoidable, unless you had table reservations. Elevators for the VIP. Watch your step, ladies and gents!
- Nowhere to sit (even if half of the tables were empty in the club), and couldn't even take off my shoes for a moment of rest. Security watched all patrons very closely. Needless to say, my group was called out several times. 
- Rude restroom attendant. Does she even want a tip? Guess not, none given.
- Expensive, small $10 bottles of Fiji water. I expected the cocktails to cost me $20 a piece, but no free glass of water?! No regular glass of tap water provided when requested and there was no other water alternative. At least at the Vegas clubs held in pool areas (i.e. Marquee, XS, Surrender) I could quench my thirst for free from a water fountain.

Now, if I were to go back, since I'm usually with male friends, I would try to arrange table reservations with a promoter. I imagine it will be tough to get in with mixed groups.",10,4,7

If you read through all the Yelp reviews, they all do a good job of summing up the whole experience. I had NO expectations after reading all the reviews. 

Here's a quick recap (pretty much what everyone else said)
CONS: 
-Disorganized lines with tons of ppl cutting. Thanks to the reviews saying that security would lead you to the wrong line, I asked and yep, I got led to the general admission line when I was really looking for the pre-sale ticket line. 
-Shitload of stairs --although they do let you wait for the elevator now even if you don't have a table. But still, line was so long that I just went up the endless amounts of stairs
-The layout is like a main hub with a random side hub that looks more like the restaurant. The main hub area looks like the inside of a spider's nest haha.
-Dance floor is total shit. No regulation whatsoever on people accessing it (at least Marquee restricts you from going to the dance floor when it gets too packed). It was so hot and packed that I literally almost passed out. 
-Nowhere to sit and they keep making you move. 
-$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$. Geez, even XS doesn't charge this much and they're the best clubs in Vegas hands down. 

PROS (if you call it that): 
-The random side area looks more like the restaurant area and the ventilation was FANTASTIC. I will say that much. The wall with the waterfall had some really good ventilation. I'm being totally serious. It was like a mini AC area. I hung out here a lot. 
-Good DJ line-up. This is basically their only saving grace. 
-The staff was actually very courteous and friendly. Despite all the other missteps of this place, the staff was surprisingly one of the nicest staff I've met. Everyone was polite and not the usual scream-at-your-face type of security. So, big kudos on that one. Yes, I know the guy checking IDs is super hardcore and anal but man, if it keeps out the little kiddies, then I'm all for them being uptight about your IDs. Even if they didn't believe that I was me. 


The most telling sign this place was a letdown? There were TONS of people leaving at only 2AM (us included). On the way down in the elevator, the security guy asked ""Did everyone have a good time?"" All 15 people in the elevator said ""NO!"" at the same time. So sad.",7,6,4

The entire place was dark and foggy, and it seemed like someone could pull you into a corner and no one would see. It didn't feel like there were many open places to dance, just lots of corridors and staircases. There was no free water in the entire place. The bar only offered bottled water at $9\/bottle, which I found to be quite unsafe in an environment that promotes drinking to excess. We had way more fun at Surrender and XS.",2,0,0

Entrance was super fast. My friends and I essentially just walked right in. 

Separate floors for each type of music. 
The hip hop room stayed packed but was never crowded. The bar line never got longer than two people, bartenders were attentive, and the drinks were pretty good. Played all the good bump beats and you could really get down to it. The bouncers , well at least the only one i talked to , was super cool. I wanted to just sit and dance next to the DJ  in the VIP-ish area and he was like "" yeah sure no problem."" Thumbs up to him. The layout of this room was great too. Have your walkways on the side, dance floor right in the front center..Never got crowded where you had to shove people to get to where you needed to go.

(We bought 5 of the 6 tickets available) We were told Steve Aoki would arrive at 12 am. He did not arrive till 1:30 am. 

As it got later and later the club manager continued to shuffle attractive women into the 8x10 space that was designated to be our VP table for the evening. By the time the DJ showed up his entire crew, and approximately 30 people (mostly women escorted up there free of charge) shoved into this DJ table area reserved for us. It was crowded and hostile, and the women were wasted spilling drinks, and pushing and shoving to get a front row spot. 

Annnnnd even more women continued to be shuffled in. 

 I understand shows get crowded, but the ""tickets"" they sold us set our expectations that we would avoid that environment.

Was it as epic as Instagram makes it out to be? Somewhat. 
Were there areas where the club could work on improving itself? Absolutely. 

I had tickets to see Hardwell during HK's grand opening back in April 2013 (which coincided with my 21st birthday), but I never had the chance to make my way to Vegas - I ended up spending the weekend at Coachella instead. (No complaints from me, that's for sure.)

A lot of people seem to complain about Hakkasan's notoriously long lines. I have no problem with buying presale tickets for a nightclub - especially one that's marketed to a high-end clientele. If you're looking to have a killer night for a reasonable price, it really boils down to being able to pick the right weekend to visit. My girlfriend and I scored tickets to see Bingo Players at HK for an absolute steal ($30 for me, 20 for her), and we didn't have to go through the stress of drunkenly waiting in the general admission line. I can't stress enough how useful it is to scope out the Events Calendar on the HK website ahead of time - you'll save yourself plenty of waiting\/money by going with presale  - just keep an eye out for the right deals!

But I digress. Let's talk about the club itself.

I expected HK to look a more extravagant; the place gives off a sort of Asian cavern-themed aesthetic. There's no outdoor section of the club to venture to if you're in search of some fresh air (unlike the open pool deck provided at Marquee even during nightclub hours), so be prepared to encounter some mild claustrophobia as you're making your way through Hakkasan's dimly-hit hallways.

The production setup at Hakkasan - like the club's overall design - was memorable, but not game-changing. During our visit, I took particular notice of the visuals that accompanied Eva Shaw and Bingo Players during their respective sets. These visuals have a remarkably high resolution and clarity, and they're quite mesmerizing (and I've been to my fair share of shows, mind you). 

As advertised, you shouldn't encounter much difficulty getting an ideal view of the main room DJ - regardless of whether you have a table or not. Unlike those at Marquee (where bouncers constantly redirect patrons around the room to keep multiple walkways clear), Hakkasan's bouncers are pretty cool about letting clubgoers scope the scene out from the perimeter of the dancefloor. I also appreciate how there's little-to-no waiting for anyone who's looking to make their way onto the actual dance space. 

What ultimately sinks the ship for me is the hit-or-miss quality of the staff at Hakkasan. On one hand, you've got the bouncers: 

Although it seems like everyone and their mother seems to despise these guys, I found them to be pleasant and cheery dudes. The bouncers who checked our IDs at the door even gave the lady and I some resounding congratulations after we mentioned that we were celebrating our six months together! Similarly, other bouncers who worked inside the club itself were happy to tell me where they purchased their suits from (I'm that guy that goes to a club and eyes other dudes' suit fits, I'll admit.)

My biggest gripe of my entire evening at Hakkasan however, was the total ineptitude of the bartending staff. Let me set the scene for you:

We approached a bar located in the HK main room. Just getting a bartender's attention was a challenge in itself; the guy serving our segment of the bar repeatedly glanced over and around us, as though we weren't there! Understaffed or not, a ""be right with you!"" would have gone a long way. Hell, even eye contact would have been an improvement over being ignored like a pair of ghosts...

In any case, after finally managing to get a bartender's attention, we asked for a Hakka to split. (For those who may not know, the Hakka is one of HK's signature cocktails, made with Belvedere, coconut, passionfruit, and lychee.) We hadn't been told, however, that Hakkasan Restaurant and Hakkasan Nightclub didn't share the same drink menu. Honest mistake, right?

Well, instead of providing this simple explanation, our bartender informed us that he ""didn't have all the ingredients"" and that we would have to go ""downstairs to the Ling-Ling bar"" in order to order a Hakka. So off we went, through a shoulder-to-shoulder crowd, to the floor below - and after a similar long wait with this bartender's counterpart, we're told that Hakkasan Nightclub doesn't offer the Hakka. At all. 

Again, it wasn't so much their inability to provide the drink that upset me so much as it was the obvious lack of adequate training and overall employee knowledge. Suffice to say, my girlfriend and I promptly had to order a pair of AMFs just to drown out our anger for the time being.

Premium product and eye candy marred by some sloppy execution. The very definition of 3\/5 stars.",2,1,1

I was actually quite excited to see Calvin Harris at Hakkasan. Everyone is always raving about this club, and I've heard that CH can do no wrong.

Wrong.

First off, what is up with these stairs? There are flights and flights of BLACK stairs. This is a riot death waiting to happen. At the end of the night, drunk girls in heels were descending these in droves, and I kept imagining my untimely death in an emergency. I guess you can wait for one of the elevators, but you might just wait there for the rest of your life. 

The dance floor is almost completely unregulated. It is a sardine can. It's almost impossible to dance, and there are people trying to knock you over every two seconds. You are literally being pushed for the entirety of your time there. You can't even stand up straight. Then, drunk idiots start jumping up and down and going crazy when there is absolutely no room to do so. 

Terrible. 

People dump their drinks all over the floor because they don't want to deal with trying to leave the floor and coming back through all the madness. Your feet will be wet and you will be slipping on and kicking glasses and bottles. 

Two girls got into a fight in the first 30 minutes we were there. Ghetto.

I swear everyone was farting. 

Disgusting.

I don't know if it was just the crowd, but the vibe was off. 90% of the people weren't dancing. Yes, there was barely any room, but even the people on other landings weren't dancing either. Were they all just Calvin Harris fans wanting to watch his dj-ing? I don't get it. 

When I went to go to the bathroom, I was denied entrance back onto the floor. Wtf? Luckily, I made friends with one of the staff who let me back through. So, tip, if you want to stay on the dance floor, make sure you don't have anything to drink, because the bathrooms are not accessible from the floor and you'll be @$$ed out. Or, you can do what I did and make friends.

None of us had fun. It was a bummer of an evening that almost made us want to stay in the following night (one girl in our group actually did) and none of us want to ever return. Luckily, Omnia was a total blast.

I don't get how people adore this club and talk smack about XS. I'd go there any day of the week over this hellhole.",26,25,5

I still can't believe I spent $18 for a single drink. Luckily, that was the only drink I had to pay for all weekend! 

There's a pretty decently-sized dance floor in the Pavillion (the main dance floor), but don't go upstairs unless you want air or have table service. There's basically no view of the stage from upstairs, but it's a good place to chill and get air before getting back onto the main floor.",4,2,2

I came with a group of 6 girls and 1 guy to Vegas on Memorial Day weekend. We were able to get on the guestlist to see Tiesto on Saturday night so we were all super excited. Our promoter told us to arrive between 9-9:30 to be guaranteed entry so we arrived at 8:45 just in case. We were the first in line and chilled for over an hour until the doors finally opened to the people on the guestlist. Then everything went downhill from there. First off, I just want to say that I understand that it's the security staff's responsibility to ensure that everyone who gets in has legitimate identification to prevent underaged kids from sneaking in. HOWEVER, it is absolutely ridiculous for you to deny us entry after we have solid proof that we are the person on our IDs. Out of all the clubs I've been to in Vegas and elsewhere had any security person question the legitimacy of my ID. Out of the 7 people in our group, 3 of us were stopped for further examination. One of the girls took her ID picture after a track meet back in high school so she looked a lot darker back then than she looks now so we were not that surprised when she was stopped. But even after she showed them her college ID and her credit card to prove that the person on her driver's license was indeed her, the bouncer claimed that her features were different from her ID and refused to listen to our reasoning. We ended up going to Marquee where we were able to get in immediately. What a terrible experience. -_-",0,0,0

Bouncers incredibly rude they would not let you get on the main dance floor, he said it was ""Too crowded...back the f! Up""  like it's our fault they let too many in, for a place too small?

I yelled back at him, no space to back up . So he yelled ""just stay there then!""  Wtf is wrong with their security? Did I just drop $400 on dinner so I can get yelled at by the bouncer?

I guess security has to be this tight when you're out running a nightclub in Vegas.

They must've checked our IDs twice before entering the club and then gave us two different stamps to our wrists each different time they checked our ID since our identities might have changed from the moment we showed our ID the first time to the second time we needed to show our ID to the guy at the door who was like 15 steps away - maybe 20 if you're in six inch heels and have to take baby steps to keep from trippin yourself up. That's quite the run-on, but I don't think I could have explained it any other way. Anyway, this is Yelp not an English term paper or thesis.

We then had to show our ID again when we paid for our drinks with a credit card at the bar. So that's, count 'em, three times your ID gets checked. Don't bother putting your ID away since you'll just be pulling it out twenty more times. 

After all this griping and custom clearance experience, there are the high points:

- Stiff drinks! My vodka tonics were more vodka than tonic. I could barely finish my second one. Not complaining though.

- Music was hot. I'm an 80's baby and grew up to hip hop so they played the jams on the second floor of the club that I didn't bother to go upstairs to see Chainsmokers. I'm sad about  it now since it would've been a free show, but the beats won my heart over. Can't fight that feeling. 

Lots of space to dance. We got to Hakkasan later than normal people would (like 230am late) and still got in, squeezed our way to the dance floor with drinks in tow and danced the remainder of the night away. They closed at 430am - we shut that place down til the lights came on. Memorable night since closing out a Vegas club is a first for me. Just happy to say I was still standing in a white dress unstained nonetheless. Well, shoot...that's two firsts in one night.

I decided to spend my money and time on this club for Memorial Day weekend, 2014. I spent a large amount of money on four tickets for two nights and drove from San Diego to Las Vegas specifically to go to two shows (Hardwell and Tiesto). When I arrived Friday night, I waited in line, which was expected. Upon getting to the front where they check ID, I presented my driver's license. According to Mark, the guard checking my ID, my picture did not look like me. He asked me a series of questions to verify my identity, and after having answered each question correctly, I was still asked to step out of the line. I was furious, however, I was instructed to go retrieve other forms of ID with my name and photo on it from the hotel and then to come back with these various other forms of ID and to see him directly for entrance. Once my boyfriend, who is an active duty sailor in the Navy, and I went to retrieve every other form of identification, we went to see Mark, who then refused to even look at any of it. He said the photo in the ID does not look like me and refused to allow me to show further proof. At this point, after having been made to go get other forms of ID and being refused service and entrance to the club I paid to be in, I asked to speak with a manager. After waiting for twenty plus minutes, another man showed up who was not management, in fact, who was under Mark, to talk to us and tell us management would not speak to us. I was even more furious. The man then told us we could get a refund for our tickets. First of all, I am extremely dumbfounded that a person whose job it is to be a security guard for a club cannot verify identification satisfactorily. I was using my actual and unexpired license which I've never had an issue with in the past. I am 23 years old, I have no reason to use a fake ID or someone else's. Then the fact that he refused to look at other forms of ID after he told me to go get it was asinine. This guy was an absolute asshole and his service was atrocious. I've never experienced such horrible and rude service in my life. To be denied service also, on Memorial Day weekend for a service member is also disgusting. Also, after having been told we could receive a refund for our troubles, after various phone calls to various people, I've been told I cannot get a refund.

The line wasn't too bad, and no need to pay for pre-tickets if you find a promoter unless it is a popular DJ or celebrity. But the line went quickly, just waiting for the elevator is what made the line feel long. 

I would suggest to not buy drinks there $15 per person that is all watered down...I think they need to do the same thing that TGIF got caught for...Not worth the money. However, if you get a table, then it is a different story. The service is great.

The club reminded me of Studio 54 and not really much changes. I did like that they had a outdoor area where there are standing tables to talk and relax and maybe sit on some of the rocks to take off the heels for a bit and heal up a little from the excruciating pain from blisters...

I do want to thank you to the group, Rudy's, that let us sit and drink with them! They were so sweet to let a lot of girls sit down when our heels were killing us. =] Much appreciated!

It's a shame, because they have so many good DJs with residency. Everything you hear about the awkward layout and the jammed packed crowds are true. The pit is a nightmare, and it's almost not worth even being that close to the DJs. You're literally touching people from all sides, and if you're lucky, you'll get a girl standing right in front of you that's just a little too intoxicated. And all night she'll whip that hair in your face with the occasional head butt, especially when she needs to lean back to take a selfie, which is every 5 minutes. But don't worry, you'll get pushed around in the crowd all night and you'll lose that girl and end up next to a crowd of smokers. My poor GF got burned by a cigarette as the girl smoking got pushed by another group trying to bull rush to the front. At least she'll have a scar to remember Hakkasan by.

Everyone sits on the stairs surrounding the dance floor and even if they weren't, you'd have to commit 100% concentration to navigating these stairs, because the buzzed you won't be able to see the random steps that lead you up and down to the sides of the club. Need a drink to get over all the trouble you've just endured? Make sure you have 30 mins or so to hang around, they've only got two small bars where each bartender serves 1 customer every 2 minutes, maybe. Unless you can fork over some change to get bottle service, do yourself a favor and head further up the strip.",7,3,3

I have NEVER been so discriminated in my life at any business until I went here. I went with a group of friends to check out their nightclub and upon entrance the bouncer pulled me aside asked me my name where I lived then ACCUSED me of being on drugs cause my eyes were big. I have natural big eyes. Next he ACCUSED me of being too fucked up and I can never enter the club again. I was sober and told him to breathalyze me or do a drug test and I'll test negative. He refused and just kicked me out. He said I was walking weird, I'm pidgeon toed! He was then mocking me with my big eyes by opening his eyes wide and talking really slowly like as if I'm stupid. 

I have never ever felt so discriminated. Hakkasan ruined my experience and I am NEVER coming back here. If you're in vegas looking for a club to enter please go to Marquee or XS. This club needs to enforce better bouncers.",28,23,5

I have been to many other crowded clubs, but when I mean crowded, it's to the point you are sandwiched by tons of people in the pit and will make a difficult situation to finding friends or getting a drink at the bar.  You can't be timid if you want to get around here, you have to use your arm to move people out of your way as courteous as possible but assertive enough to get where you need to go.  The line is long and moves slower than a line at Disneyland so you'll spend 30-40 minutes for GA.  

Tiesto was playing for $100 that night.  The price is not the problem since this is a world famous DJ playing inside a smaller club instead of a stadium.  But the whole being crowded thing doesn't make for money well spent.  

If you really want to see a high profile DJ such as Tiesto for $100, Wet Republic is the best experience for GA.  I was able to get in right away, waited in a line that only took less than 5 minutes and was at the front.  I never had a problem with the crowd at a day party and I was able to stand in the front section and see Tiesto up close without fighting any crowds.  We all had our space and you didn't have to be shoved and fight for space to get a good view or to walk around to find friends or get a drink at the bar.  Wet Republic felt more like a VIP experience because it was still packed to feel like a party but you still had your space to walk around.",2,0,0

I've been here three times to see R3hab, Above & Beyond, and Tiesto. R3hab was the only positive experience I had. The two other times, I felt very mistreated. The people who work here and the men they lure into this club are misogynistic and rude. For Tiesto, I was with 10 girls and we were in the VIP section. My boyfriend and I were doing our separate things that night but he came over to me in the VIP section to come say hello. They didn't allow him in the section, which makes sense since he didn't pay to be in VIP. But what really made me upset was when the bouncer who was monitoring the VIP section realized that he was my boyfriend, he came over to me and told me that I needed to leave the section. I asked him why and he told me that since I had a boyfriend, I was pretty much useless in selling the table since I wouldn't be ""flirting"" with any of the guys who end up buying the table. In his exact words: ""You would bring the value of the table down."" Just because I wasn't single, I was bringing the value of the table down.

The last time was this weekend with Above & Beyond. My friends and I didn't come with a promoter and were glad we didn't because the line was 2 hours long for the guest list. We get in and even though we actually paid for our tickets, a person that works there ushered us to sit at a table with some guys. We didn't want to, but my friends feet hurt so bad that we ended up deciding to sit (mind you, you can't sit down anywhere unless you buy a table or decide to entertain guys who bought a table). We sit, the server pours us drinks, and we were hoping at least these guys would be nice. Nope, one of the guys immediately took the drink the server gave me out of my hand and told me that if I'm going to drink, I'm going to have to entertain him. I stood up and left because I wasn't going to prostitute myself in order to sit down. I was pretty upset and what made it even worse was that the person that worked there who ushered us to the table told us that we were rude for leaving their table within 5 minutes.

1 - Thursday night.  1 star

My group of 5 girls were celebrating my birthday.  We started out at Marquee, then went to Hakkasan to check out the ""hottest new club.""  We get to Hakkasan around 2 am (with no one in line).  When we get to the booth, the cashier asks for $20 from each girl for cover.  We told her the promoter we met today said it was free cover for girls and they said that was before 1 am.  (We stepped to the side (no one was in line and we were not in anyone's way), so one of my friends could call my sister and see if she still wanted to meet us inside.  The bouncer told us to get out of line and that we had to go back in line to come in again.  There was NO ONE in line.  Stupid bouncer.  We were ready to get back in line, when another bouncer let us back in.  He was the only nice one.  Somehow we ended up going for free.  Yay!  I had high expectations, so the club was just ok.  It was pretty crowded for a Thursday night.  Expensive drinks.  While we were in the club, my sister got in line, the bouncer splashed some liquid on her and did not apologize.  SO RUDE!  They asked for her ID and told her she was blacklisted.  WTH?  She couldn't finish celebrating my birthday with me.  

2:  Saturday night.  4 stars

We knew Tiesto was playing, so the boys got pre-sale tickets for $75 and the girls were on a guestlist.  Boys got in within 10 minutes (we got there at 10 pm).  Girls had to wait awhile.  The lines are quite confusing.  During ID check, my friend's ID was looked at for quite awhile and my sister was asked a bunch of questions for hers.  We got in 20-30 minutes later with free cover.  Hip hop room (downstairs) was nice, but the dance floor was too small.  The Pavillion was way too crowded, but that's what you expect at a club with Tiesto playing.  Somehow we made our way up to the DJ booth.  We are even pictured in Hakkasan's photos from that night.  The waterfall area is nice to chill by.  We all had a good time.  I still think it's ridiculous to sell a teeny tiny bottle of Fiji water for $8 though.",3,1,0

I am impressed by the magnitude, scale and spectacle of this place.  It's truly spectacular and worth a visit, just to see.  At times I felt like I was watching a live concert for a big name DJ, at times I felt like I was watching a lot of people popping Mollies while watching a live concert of a big name DJ, and at times I just caught myself looking around at the sea of people on the 4th and 5th floors.  Seriously, how many people does this place hold?  5,000? 10,000??  I couldn't really tell.

So why won't I come back?  Simply put, I just don't feel safe in this place.  Here's the deal:  I am sure Las Vegas nightclubs have codes and regulations up the wazzoo and the Hakkasan folks followed them to a T.  That being said, this is a scale and magnitude never seen before.  I think my own common sense observation of the main floor was that if something went wrong we would be in a lot of trouble trying to make our way to an exit along with the deluge of humanity enclosed in the space.  The light show made me wonder what the risk of a fire was, the amount of people in the space made me realize we weren't searched by security when we came in and we were one idiot with a gun away from chaos.  Maybe I am completely paranoid, but I really thought just based on common sense that you could easily end up in a dangerous situation at this place.

So all in all I was glad to have been once and seen how Vegas can one-up itself once again, but I think I'd be very apprehensive to risk going back.",3,0,0

Yelps description of a 2 star place pretty much sums it up, ""Meh. I've experienced better"". As I'm getting older, I'm turning more into an economist than a club goer. The design of the club is set up perfectly for MGM Grand to cash in on the lucrative VIP table service product. I wouldn't doubt that it makes more revenue per square foot than any other establishment on the strip. Their goal is clearly to steer the customer into buying a table, as it is nearly impossible to hangout within the club unless you have one. With so many tables crammed into every inch of the place (many without a view of the DJ booth or dance floor), there is less room for the reason why people go a nightclub, to dance. As well, I don't understand how other Yelpers can call this place ""huge"". Take out half the VIP tables, expand the dance floor, and only then you can call it big. I grew up seeing these type DJs in warehouses, afterhours clubs, and raves long before it was called EDM. Those types of places you can call ""huge"". Personally, I didn't like the décor or sound system as much as the other strip night clubs. I'd be shocked if it beats out Marquee or XS in DJ Magazine's Top 100 Clubs in 2014.

A couple tips if you must go here: 
Get your tickets ahead of time. If you're staying at the MGM Grand talk to whoever is handling your reservation to set you up free ones. I'm not a high roller and have a penis, yet I pulled it off on a night the Bingo Players were spinning. It can happen, just ask around and plan ahead of time. 
When checking in, request your room on the West Wing part of the hotel. It is the shortest walk to and from the club (also the shortest to the front doors out to the strip). The stairs are pain in here, no sense in making things worse on the walk back to your room.
Absolutely check out the hip-hop room. It reminds me of when clubs were clubs: low ceilings, thugged out women, and bass driven music.
If you buy a table, make sure it doesn't have a view of a wall. Many do. Request one on the dance floor or in the balcony that overlooks the dance floor. You won't be disappointed with these tables.

Everything else equal here in Vegas, you'll find the typical douche bag bouncers, trust fund schmucks, and over priced drinks. Good for MGM's piggy bank, bad for people who actually want to dance to their favorite EDM DJ.",4,2,0

We paid some $2500 for a table thinking that we could have a great time on my buddy's bachelor party. Everything went as planned - great service, very polite waitress and nice ambiance - until one of the bouncers decided to be the macho man.

Our bachelor decided to lie down on the seat (this is at the very table we paid for.) Then out of nowhere a bouncer came and yelled at him "" GET THE FU** UP "". Yes, he did say the ""F"" word.

Sure we understand that you cannot go to sleep in a club. But that does not give him any right to disrespect anyone by calling ""F"" word. It could have been something like ""you can't sleep. get up"". 

So we confronted him by asking why he was being so rude. Then he realized that he has stepped over the line and got very defensive. Then the whole drama started. He called the backup by speaking to his radio and the entire bouncer gang stormed into our table making it a huge deal. We tried to explain what happened ( how the first bouncer been so rude for no reason ) to the head bouncer thinking some justice might come out of it. Well, we were wrong. That guy was as rude as they come. 

He not only defended his fellow bouncer's behavior but also asked us to leave the club for confronting the bouncer over his actions. So basically the only thing we did to deserve this treatment was to stand up to ourselves against ill-treatment of that first bouncer. 

Anyways, we are regulars in Vegas and usually, we prefer table services to have a hassle free party experience.

Our friend said, ""I got us on the guest list.""  

I said, ""Did you tell them there's one guy?  And I'm not going to have to wait in the main line am I?""

Our friend messages the promoter again and he says, ""Sure, not a problem but for guys it is the standard $100 cover to get in.""

The girls were shocked.  $100? Really?  I had to tell them, yeah, it sucks to be a guy, but that's a typical rate for a guy trying to get into a club on a weekend that has a big name DJ.  I don't mind (I'm not one that complains about things when the going rate is the going rate).  Pre-sale tickets for guys are always $60-$100 vs. being only $30-$50 for girls for all of these clubs with EDM DJs.

So lucky me, getting to be the hot dog between three female buns.   We arrived in the guest list line at 10:30 and it took us just 40 minutes to get to the front of that (it's Friday, it's packed).  Mainly parties of girls in the guest line with a couple of guys here and there.   

We get to the iPad check-in girls and they find our name.  3 girls, 1 guy.  Then the girl looks confused and goes to ask the other check-in girl something.  Then she comes back to us with a ticket marked... 3 girls check in the ""C"" box.  1 guy check in the ""C"" box.  We get to the cashier.  She takes our ticket.  The bouncer near the cashier is really chill, we are just talking and joking with him while waiting to go through the last ropes.  ALL OF US ARE IN FOR FREE!  

You go upstairs.  Ladies with heels, there are a lot of them!  Level 3 is hip hop.  It's a rectangular floor with bars at each end.  Service was fast at both sides.  Drinks are about $15-$18 each.  Playing old school and newer hip-hop, I liked this room the best for dancing.  The dance floor was packed, but there was still room to dance.  

Level 4 is where the EDM DJ of the night holds court.  It's huge.  There are go go girls walking, posing, dancing on elevated areas on the edges.  They are costumed and look like a cross between a Paris fashion show\/ Cirque Du Soleil\/Gothy Jean Paul Gaultier.  

To get to the main dance floor you have to walk down.  There are tables\/booths set up in arena seating style and then a sunken pit\/dance floor.  It's live down there but not that fun because you're mashed chest to chest\/butt to butt with whoever's next to you.  You're wondering how you can dance in no space and then 40 seconds later somebody walks by and wants to pass through.  

It's huge, there are lots of booths, the dance floor is big, but the configuration isn't optimal.  If you buy a table facing the dance floor, you get a table with a view, but it's so detached and elevated that you don't really feel like you are in the middle of the action. It's like sitting in a suite at basketball or hockey game.  You're at the game, but you're not really with the crowd.  If I pay for a table, I want some exclusivity, but I also want people to pass by and have the feeling that I can leave my table, take two steps, and be dancing, whether in an aisle or on the main floor.  I didn't get that feeling here.  

There are even more tables farther back away from the main arena area (the Pavilion).  These tables are hurtin'.  You can't even see the dance floor from most of those table.  If I sprung $1000-$1500 for one of these lesser tables,  I would feel really cheated.  There's no bar by them, people can't really dance in the aisles.  You have limited or no view of the DJ.  Chicks are not going to want to come up to a table that far away.  

I kept on reading about this impressive waterfall in all the publication reviews.  I had to see it, because it sounded like water was flowing from massive rocks down and through.  It took me forever to find it because it was in the corner and... it's lame.  It's a tall dark stone slab that has water coming straight down.  Ever walked into a friends' house foyer and see a slim seven foot high flat stone water structure that you can buy and plug in?  It's like that, just way larger.  So overrated.

The best ""hidden"" spot to get a drink, sit and relax without having to get a VIP table is the Ling Ling Lounge, which is off to the side but on the same floor as the Ling Ling (Hip-Hop) Club.  The Ling Ling Lounge is surprisingly empty, but you can sit in chairs or lounge pieces and chill out.  It has a brown\/red tint to the room, so if you see that you know you're in the right place.  

***Quick & Dirty Summary***

Top rate DJ lineup... Calvin Harris, Tiesto, Steve Aoki, Deadmau5, etc.  Massive, impressive club that should be checked out for it's sheer grandiose and design.  The bartenders and staff were all nice and efficient.  Drinks are normal Vegas club pricey. The regular line to get in is super long.  If you are guest listed, get in line by 10:45, as they might stop letting people in at 11:15-11:30.   I really don't like how the EDM floor is set up.

I was invited back to Hakkasan with comped VIP tickets (Pretty much just tickets to cut the line). This experience was a lot better than the previous experience. However, I noticed a lot of similar problems as the first time. The biggest difference was just that the ratio was a bit better and the dance floor wasn't AS packed, but still way too packed. 

Simply put, come to Hakkasan if it's a DJ you really REALLY MUST  see. The experience most likely will be lacking because of the packed dance floor. 

Or come if you can get in for free. 

Or come if you're willing to blow some serious cash on a table. 

Otherwise STAY AWAY. 

I've had multiple friends get injured on the dance floor because of how crowded it was. This includes being stepped on, being elbowed in the nose, and best of all, having a drunkard think you're messing with them and start beating the shit out of you. Honestly surprised there isn't a lawsuit going on.

Review 11\/27\/2013
I'm confused what all the hype is about. This was one of the worst clubbing experiences I've had in Las Vegas. 

Pluses:
It's pretty

Cons:
All the space is dedicated to  tables
The ratio was like at LEAST 80 percent guys 
The DJ was absolutely horrendous

Compound all of this on to a small dance floor and you get a cramped cockfest with everyone just standing there.

For the price you pay, this was just ridiculous.

Hakkasan, please learn to set a better ratio into the club. I'm pretty sure if there was a group of guys, they would rather not get in than get in and be crowded with a bunch of other dudes. 

Also for the dance floor, security should regulate the amount of people entering the dance floor. This would ensure that people are not squished like sardines and aren't even able to move.",15,6,4

We booked a $5,000 minimum table and the Hostess and the bus boy were just plain rude. Not only that the type of people who go there are ghetto and obnoxious.  

Presale tickets are definitely cheaper at this club and there's a reason for that. It is because they are not selective in the crowd they bring in and this place is not classy at all. The girls and the crowd at this club were all ugly as hell.

We went to XS the next day and met some Vegas locals that just came from Hakkasan. They told us ""the crowd was so ghetto that we had to leave and come here."" Now I only booked a cabana at XS but the service and the people were 10000000x better than hakkasan was. 

To be honest I only went to Hakkasan because I never been but if your thinking the same thing. Trust me its not worth it. Your gonna be in there packed like sardines with ugly smelly people. If you wanna fish can it then this might be the place for you but its definitely not for me.

I also forgot to mention why I decided to actually create a yelp account to write this review.. Not only did I book that $5,000 dollar minimum table our group also got kicked out from it as well. 

Some passerby-er in the club decided to walk by and throw up in front of our table. The bus boy blamed it on our group and kicked us all out. When I asked him which one of us did you see do it he said that he didn't know but it had to be ours because it was in front of our table. No one in my group was even drunk yet and I would know if it was someone from our that threw up. It definitely was not us and the bus boy didn't even know who it was. He merely made a judgement call based on what he saw in front of the table. I gave a $500 hand shake tip in the beginning too...",7,8,2

Although me and my friends (all girls) got the VIP treatment, no line, no cover charge and separate entrance, but the club is horrible.  It was overcrowded, no where to walk, to chill or to dance, so if you don't have a booth, I suggest you don't bother with this club, you will spend most of your time moving inch by inch.  There are VIPs booths all throughout the club, but the booths are just tiny, basically you're just over paying for a 4x4 space to hang out.  When  you do walk around the club, it felt like you're being herd around like cattle.  Would not come back even if my life is depend on it.",5,0,0

The security team told us that unless we had a table we couldn't get on the dance floor. So we came to see Calvin Harris and didn't even catch a glimpse of him. In fact we couldn't even spot the DJ booth! So in other words choose a different club, any club but this one. I've never been told I was dressed inappropriate or told to change and I've never been to a club where you couldn't dance. That's why we came here! Save your time and money- go anywhere else.

Went on Saturday 12\/5\/15 to see The Chainsmokers.  Please note- this review is about the club as a whole and not about The Chainsmokers- they always put on a good show.

I was in town with my husband and we contacted a promoter to get in to Hakkasan.  We were promised guest list entry and 2 free drinks. 

We arrived around 10:30 and went into the guest list line- it was a joke!  Turned out to be a wait of almost an hour.  The lines seemed so disorganized. Don't they do this every week- you would think that they would have a better\/more organized entry system. People kept cutting ahead- it was chaotic.  Finally we were let in but weren't given any drink tickets.  I contacted my promoter when I got in and he said it was a cashier mistake and we should have been given drink tickets before entering.  Live and learn.

There were 4 flights of stairs to climb to enter.  The entry hallway was dark and I heard there's an elevator but I didn't see it.  

This place is greedy.  It was so insanely packed and ridiculous. I'm sure it was over capacity. There was no place to stand.  We kept getting chased away by security every time we found a place to stand.  The dance floor was elbow to elbow.  People couldn't even dance- mostly everyone was just standing and shuffling to the music in one spot.  Considering this is Vegas you would picture a huge amazing club.  I have been to better and more smoothly run local dance clubs here in Atlanta.

Also- 1 beer and one Grey Goose w\/soda was $30.  I think this a place to go to only if you get a table and bottle service (which I heard goes for $2k to $4k.) Hakka-scuse-me?  Ridiculous. Or if you REALLY want to see a dj and can't catch them in a smaller local venue.

Tables and booths take up 80 percent of this club space.

Hakkasan was a major fail in my book for many reasons.  I would say skip this place unless your ideal mate is a 5'0"" asian male. 

First of all, the managers and promoters are incredibly rude and 'require photo submission' to get on guestlist. seriously, WHAAT?! you know those hot girls in 5inch heels and skin-tight dresses? HELL no do they want to walk half a mile, just to go up and down a bajillion stairs. Get it together; your club sucks and Lady LingLing is unsatisfied.

While I understand the sentiment by some (e.g., stairs, rude staff, and pricey), I feel that if you want to attend a top club with top talent then you must understand you will have to pay some money. Most importantly it eliminates the riff raff. You buy what you get.  And we (me and my gf) are perfectly fine with it. Granted we all want to have bottle services, but you will have to shell out a lot of cash.  

Anyhow, we stayed at the MGM (West Wing) which conveniently was close to the entrance of the club.  I purchased pre-sale tickets on the day it went on sale (back on April 24 I believe).  Biggest advice I can give everyone who is planning to go on a Holiday weekend: Purchase the tickets the day it goes on sell.  The longer you wait the more expensive it will get. We arrived around 930 and at first we were a bit confused. There's already a long ass line. However, there were some lovely looking ladies with signs trying to control the traffic flow. There's basically three lines: General Admission (highly inadvisable), Guest List (I must admit don't know what's that about), and finally Pre-Sale Tickets (Highly advisable). A very nice bouncers asked us if we had pre-sale tickets, and I told him yes (I showed him the tickets). He then led us to another line that had ""Pre-Sale Tickets"" and he told us this is where we belonged. The line was very short and within 10 minutes we were in the club.  

The bouncers did scrutinized our ID's, but my lady went in with no problem and I used my military ID card. It pays when you are in your 30's, no hassles, you are veterans of the club scene, and we are here to see a top DJ. 

Once inside we were led to the elevators. This caught me by surprise as I was expecting to endure three flights of stairs.  I guess if you have pre-sale tickets they rectified the complaints of using stairs. Or maybe the people that wrote their reviews didn't pay pre-sale tickets. Once we arrived inside the club it is simply amazing. Michael Woods was spinning as the pre-cursor before Calvin did his set . Good mixes and beautiful women. The women to men ratio is high. So guys if you are here to meet quality women this is your chance. But come correct guys.

The drinks ARE pricey. Two drinks (Bombay sapphire and tonic and Grey goose and tonic) around 30 bucks. I also had a shot of Don Julio 1942 for $50. The Fiji water is pricey, but I didn't care. I was here to have a good time. It was crowded but it's expected for Calvin Harris. His set was amazing. First time we've seen him and we were very impressed. 

Overall, the club is very nice, trendy, and classy. Granted it's only one time that I have been here, but I guess is different when you purchase pre-sale tickets and you are accompanied with your significant other. The bouncers were very helpful guiding us through the potential maze. And the use of the elevator was the kicker. You pay what you get guys and gals. We were very impressed. Kudos to MGM. Now we need to try Marquee and XS.",2,1,2

The workers here are incredibly friendly. I've read some reviews about how the workers here don't care about you or are jerks, but that was not my experience on both occasions. There are a LOT of the male security workers all around, and they were all very very helpful and friendly. I was really surprised actually. At the end of the night they even asked how my night went and if I had fun, etc.  

In order to make your experience here pleasant, I suggest you plan ahead and expect the worst. That may be why I enjoyed myself.  For Tiesto, I bought presale tickets (70 bucks, yikes!) and I went early. I wasn't about to go late, wait in a long line and complain about it. No, I started pounding drinks around 9, waited in line around 10-10:30, and got inside no problem. It really depends on the week though. The first time I went wasn't so bad because it was an off week, but during EDC week it was a mess. I wanted to go there for Hardwell on Thursday, but presale tickets went up to $100 (and sold out), and the line was packed by 10pm. I didn't plan ahead that night so I went somewhere else.  For Dada Life on Wednesday during EDC week, I went early and didn't have a problem though. 

Everyone knows how expensive drinks are at the clubs in Vegas, so there's no point in going over that. $6 mini Fiji waters (they don't give you free tap water), at LEAST $9 for a shot. Every female worker here is at least a 7 or 8.

So the venue.  It's HUGE. So many places to walk around and explore. But do know that on busy nights, they fill every nook and cranny with a body. It was ok on my first night, but during EDC week it was insane. The main dance floor is big, but pretty small if you think about how many people are inside this club. I wasn't able to even move around.  However, they do have a second dance floor in the back, on the first floor that doesn't seem to get too crowded. There was lots of room to hang out and dance freely there, and the music quality was just as good.

When I go back to Vegas, and if there is an awesome DJ playing here again, I will go back. Just make sure to plan ahead. Unless you have connects in Vegas, you don't want to just wing it.

Got in for free.

Guest list goes through two lines.

Tip: get there before 11, 10 isn't a bad idea, I didn't go through a crazy wait. (for guest list at least). My friend said she waited 3 hours one time and didn't get in, not sure why anyone would wait that long but yeah.. Second line: id check & stamped, and then guest-list check & stamp and then you go to a window booth thing inside (like a movie theater)

Experience is just weird, you get in, go into elevators and so on.. 

What to expect: classier than the LIGHT nightclub in terms of outfits (not all, but not so much of leggings and crop-top kind of place, guys were more well-dressed.

Atmosphere: I like it more than LIGHT, but in terms of music I might of liked LIGHT more, I wasn't too fond of it here. It's EDM, but I didn't feel like it was great.

BUT

Theres a HIP-HOP floor, it's downstairs! I loved it! Some people had mixed feelings: some songs were great, some were bad.

It's less crowded down there than for the EDM floor, a bit more intimate in a way though. 

----

CREEP FACTOR (not in regards to the club, but attendees):

Just for that night for me, I didn't have to deal with anything like in LIGHT, felt like the guys were nicer in a way, not entirely. 

I really liked the hip-hop floor we met a random girl and there were these guys and we're all dancing together  in a way (but not on each other.. so that's cool).

But there were guys arguing on the EDM floor if they knew us and random stuff.. DUDE, you're trying too hard.. I don't get guys.. They weren't touchy freely, but they didn't leave us alone..  

There will still be drunken bimbos everywhere you go though, not classy.. spilling your drinks and stuff..

Bar:

I only got one drink: lemon drop shooter (cheaper than the martini), I felt like the bartender.. she can't make drinks.. just my thought. 

Tip:

Bar upstairs(still EDM floor) is less crowded that the first floor (EDM).

have a lot of 'specials' in there, perfume, lotion and stuff.. interesting..",3,0,0

I'm 26 years old and showed them my legitimate drivers license. They were very rude and condescending throughout the whole situation which included them showing my ID to about 5 different people. We ended up leaving eventually then went back to see how we could get our money back and they treated us like we were criminals and told us that we needed to leave and that they didn't want us there.

They promoted it like crazy everywhere you go, so much that it's a mad mess when you get there. There's 3 or 4 different lines and a sea of people all over the place. However, there are plenty of staff that will direct you to the right line after which you'll wait 30+ mins in that line to get into the club and get stamped about 2-3x. Once you finally make it in you'll go up about 4 flights of stairs, (they have elevators too) and you'll arrive to an overly crowded place with people elbowing you left and right while you're waiting to get yourself a $20 drink. The music was great, but it was just too crowded to even have a good time and after about 20 mins we bailed. As we were walking out one of the bouncers asked if we'd go back in if he could find us someone's private table to hang out at. Um, thanks but no thanks, the 21 year old me probably wouldn't have hesitated, but hellz to no for 32 year old me. I'm all about the YOLO life motto but round 2 of going out to clubs in Vegas was enough for me. I'm good for the rest of the year!

A small group of friends and I went to Hakkasan for Memorial Day weekend, which also happened to be one of my friends' birthday weekend. We were there Friday (Tiesto who played for 4+ hours!) and Saturday (Calvin Harris and Michael Woods) nights... 

Our first night (and  my first time at Hakkasan) was out of control! We waited outside maybe 60 seconds before we were walked in to get our ID's checked (don't even try if you're under 21) and then quickly led to the elevator and up to the 4th or 5th floor- it was the main dance floor. We had table 11 (directly across from the dj- TIESTO in this case, on the first tier of the dancefloor- so directly on the dancefloor) on Friday and it was, in my opinion, the best table in the place!!! We were immediately introduced to a security lead, Steven, and a guard named Arey. Both were EXTRAORDINARY. I smoke cigarettes and whenever I decided to smoke(mind you, it's VERY well ventilated), it seemed like it was ALWAYS lit before I even pulled it out...the bottle girls, bottle service assistants AND security were right there to light me up! And if someone we didn't know was hanging around the table, or whatever, security was there to quickly handle the situation. This table is not cheap, but DEFINITELY worth it if you are celebrating!! The tables have dance platforms above the tables for people (seemed like 99% girls) to dance on. In short, we never were in short supply of beautiful girls to hang out with!

Saturday was a little different. Without going into too much detail, I felt a little hustled by our bottle service girl- which is expected at Las Vegas nightclubs, but all in all it was a good time. It may very well have been that the previous night was so unforgettable that I had VERY, VERY high expectations!! This night, we had a stage table. I didn't quite like it as much because we were so excluded from the rest of the club that there was virtually no interaction with the people and we were really, really far from the bathroom. But other than that, it was a lot of fun. Definitely an interesting perspective...

Tips: Dress to impress, get there early if you don't have a table, if you dont want to pay an expensive cover- buy presale tickets, and be respectful to everyone.",2,0,1

Guest list you will have to stand in front of their club for two hours and then when you are about to step in, they will tell you that you have to pay for cover. And it's not even a reasonable price either. And you stood there to helped promote their club for free and you didn't even get in! If they cut off the guest list line they should at least tell you right at the time they cut off, but they let you stand there for two hours to make them look busy. It's selfish and greedy cause the times you are wasting there you could have time to think about where you can go or find out another option for them. And staffs will ignore you completely if you act like you don't wanna pay for cover. I saw some people who were so excited about their night got turned down just like that. I meant tourists want to make their memorable nights but not all of them can afford to spend 5k or more in one night for only two people or couples. But maybe they can spend $500+ from buying small drinks at the bar for their friends or ladies. They are all assholes seriously! Me and my friends then left to XS who actually welcomed us better and the staffs at XS always have the best service! We can just use the cover fee money that we supposed to pay at Hakkasan buying drinks at XS and we even spend more than that. We had a great time so good that we decided to open bottle service that very night. We are not cheap but to discriminate people like that plus treating people like that, I need to spread the news to knowledge people how they will be treated and what to expect if they want to visit this place. You can go try this out yourself, and you will understand why I am so upset over this. If Hakkasan's staff still stuck up and held their nose up high then I wish their business will go just as the way they treat their customers. Peace! Luv XS and Marquee!! Always make my night!!",2,2,0

We were having a good time and met another couple, my wife and her new friend who had just got married decided to dance on the back part of a sofa, the part were everyone else was dancing. They were there having a good time, when a D-bag manager or pr guy decided to come over to the table in front, he hit on them but when he noticed that we were there as couples he told them to get down from there and in a rude way said ""you are regular people"". I do not know what that means, but we paid to get in and I was paying $30 for a beer and a small cup of vodka and cranberry. I do not know if I am regular people because I am Mexican, dark skin or not a high roller.   He was there like a good D bag drinking from the table bottle and bringing single girls. What ever he does to try to get laid it's cool but when someone that is supposed to be an authority and represent a high-end club calls the costumers ""regular people"". Something is wrong. 

I am sharing a picture in case you see him be aware he does not like ""regular people"" in his club, you need to spend $10,000 and get a table so he can hit on drunk girls and then you will not be ""regular people"". 

One of the high points of the night was the guys that work in the bathroom, always nice, always smiling and never expecting or asking for a tip. They would always ask if you need anything else, if you were having fun and if you were ok. They do not get enough credit for the difficult job they have.

After we got out of that line, we were moved to another one and informed it would be $20 for my boyfriend to get in, but free for me.

My husband did the demolition of Studio 54 and some of the construction for Hakkasan, so I was intrigued to see what the final product was all about. 

As I've mentioned in other of my reviews, my ""weekend"" consists of Wednesdays and Thursdays, so since Hakkasan is closed on Wednesday, I assume it was not as crowded on a Thursday as it is on Saturdays. The nights that I have gone, locals are free, not sure what they charge typically, but free is GREAT! Their resident DJ's are great! I've seen Calvin Harris, Dada Life, Tommy Trash, Nervo, R3hab, Above and Beyond, and Fergie DJ, always a good time! 

As for the negatives. The layout is interesting, like many have said, TONS of stairs. But they DO have elevators, which I've been taking advantage of more often now! As for the main EDM room, it's always packed, either they let in too many people in or they come in from different rooms all at the same time. There are times when the club is so overcrowded and hot that it seems like you can barely breathe! Talk about a fire hazard!

It's big, but I really think more of the space should have been used for dance floor instead of VIP tables (and we had a table in the hip hop room!).

I am deeply embarrassed for the owners. It was shocking how cheaply designed, messy, and poorly planned the entire club felt. 

The layout makes no sense, the staff were wearing gimmicky Asian-themed outfits (GET IT?! Cause you're in an ""ASIAN"" club?! plz.) , and the decorations left **much** to be desired - e.g. upside down parasols all over the ceiling that look like they were $2 at World Market and hanging paper lights - you know, like the ones you can buy at Ikea\/Target when you're in college? The DJ booth area looks like an unimpressive rave festival stage. VERY amateur aesthetics, to say the least. This is especially baffling given that Hakkasan expects 90% of their clients (i'm basing this number off their tablespace to dancefloor ratio) to buy a table. Why would anyone want to spend an unnecessary amount of money to be in a super trashy room? 

How do they expect to compete with Marquee, XS, and Light when their venue is so tacky and ugly....and in case you're wondering, the overall appearance of the crowd matches Hakkasan's interior design. 

Also, i ordered a CLUB SODA at the bar because I was extremely parched and not in the mood to get drunk in such an underwhelming environment, and the bartender took 15 minutes to get to me and then charged me $7, plus NO REFILLS. Seriously, Hakkasan?? Have you no class or shame at all? I mean, i know you spent wayyyy too much money signing up all those bigtime DJs  and you're super worried about recovering the expenses, but c'mon - this is just pathetic.

More complaints: dangerously crowded, absolutely NO SITTING allowed anywhere even in the few spots where it would make perfect sense to allow people to rest their feet (i'd be very amused if this rule was for ""safety"" bc i'm quite certain we'd all die in an emergency evacuation no matter what bc the club is a confusing, overcrowded labyrinth), $75 cover for guys (aka. shoulda bought those $30 presale tix online bc the promoter who said he'd give the guys ""reduced cover"" was totally lying!), subpar gogodancers, and the main act came on at 2AM after an obnoxious emcee narrated a pointless costume contest to the puzzled crowd for 10 minutes too long.

Never go here, even if you're curious to just ""check it out"" for the first time (which was my mistake). And no, not even their amazing EDM residencies can offset the overall negative experience. I came here for FREE to see a topnotch DJ and i'm STILL offended and want my time back. This club kills good vibes.

Hakkasan will certainly not be a lasting nightlife institution in Vegas. XS, Marquee, and Light must be relieved.",16,9,5

My friends and I were hesitant because who arrives at the club that early right? Well we did it anyway because we didnt want to pay and it super sucked because we were all wearing heels. Starting early and wearing heels is not the best idea. There was already a line for guys but the girls line was so short. We waited for 45 minutes before we could actually get in so we just took photos and talked to a bachelorette party in the meantime. Oh well, at least it was free for us :)

You get in and the venue is pretty nice but all I cared about was the hip home floor. There are tons of bottle service tables and surprisingly the dance floor is pretty small. They played pretty good music since I am not a fan of EDM so I was pleased with that. We kept switching back from EDM floor to hip hop just because we wanted to explore the crowd but it totally took a toll on our feet since we wore heels. That night, actually that whole weekend, there were almost no yellow fellows out there so I was pretty disappoint. I think it was mostly white people so if you want the asians, your best bet is XS. Maybe that weekend was a fluke but when I go to vegas next time, Ill just stick with Marquee and XS. Calvin Harris was there that night but our feet were dying so we left before seeing him and grabbed food. What a yolo.

**TIPS**
1) Just get a promoter and get in for free. Be wary of what time she tells you to arrive and add an hour to the estimated time so you wont have to arrive hella early.
2) So many staircases, so painful for feet. Just wear flats to the club mang.
3) Enjoy the hip hop floor!",6,1,2

The walk ways between bars are narrow and if you are not at a table touching the dance floor you can't see the affects or Dj booth clearly at all.

Hakkasan is great if you love mainstream music and enjoy raging  shoulder to shoulder with everyone else. It is also great for when you feel like balling out and treated like a king when spend the right amount of money.

If they had  more original sets and didn't over crowd, Hakkasan could get 4-5 stars. The ling ling room is a 4 star hip hop spot. I've had awesome times in there.

On top of all of this, the venue isn't even that good and it's small, compact and sweaty. All of the other nightclubs in Vegas are much better. Take it from a local, go to XS, Surrender or Light. Anywhere but here!",0,0,0

All I have to say its pretty big with the 5 Levels. I just did not like the place though, For one its way too crowded which I know Las Vegas clubs cant get crowded but this place is uncomfortable crowded, second the 5 levels makes it very easy to lose someone, and lastly its overrated. 

Overall I wouldn't come here, Ill stick to other clubs.

Space: when compared to other clubs like XS, Drais, and, Omnia, Hakkasan's location and layout sucks.  The club itself and dance floor is TINY.   It's in the middle of MGM, has no connection to the outdoor and doesn't have any pools for dayclub.  Hakkasan also features the stairs from hell. You'll be climbing flight after flight of stairs.

Club itself: ALWAYS overpacked.  There's literally no where you can chill.  Unless you have a table, your experience will be nothing but security flashing their lights at you screaming to get out of the walk-way.

I understand having bottle service can either make or break your experience at any Vegas club, but I've had great times at other clubs without it.  You can get better bottle service at other clubs also!  Hakkasan charges an average of $2500 for 6 people.  At XS, they charge about $700 per bottle for every 3 people.  You can get TWO BOTTLES for $1400 at between 6 people at XS.",8,1,1

Once we got to MGM, we couldn't figure out where the line starts, but one of the promoters led us to the line and it went by pretty quick. The cool thing about this club is that is apparently has five floors. I went on a Sunday night, the hip hop floor (level 3) wasn't open, just the lounge, but you could still go there and enjoy the music which is what we did for a while. Then we went to 5th & 4th level which was House music. It was frikken awesome, and this is coming from someone who doesn't listen to House music.

I've been here for Tiesto, Calvin Harris, and W&W, and didn't really like my experience any of those times... Tiesto is a slight exception because my friends had a table in the hip hop room. This would definitely be a 1 star review if not for the hip hop room, it's more fun up there, especially because it's not as crowded!

This place is also suuuper expensive for guys, usually $75 and up for the good DJs, free for girls on guest list though (glad i'm a girl lolz, but sucks for my guy friends)!

PROS
1. LOVE ALL THE DETAILS! They don't have your ordinary ""go go dancers"", they have these awesome costumed dancers who make the artsy modern atmosphere even better! Made me feel I was watching KA. I like that before Bingo Players began, they had a dragon intro on the screen, which made it feel as if I was at a concert. They gave out SO many of the light sticks so it was so festive the day we went on Sat 4\/20! Also, they had blow up monkey dolls floating on the main dancers - this made it feel so Spring Break! I had a blast that night!

2. THE DANCE FLOOR IS BIG ENOUGH! For those who are complaining about the dance floor being too small - uh which clubs are you comparing it to?! HELLO! It surely is bigger than Marquee and XS's main room! 

3. THEY HAVE ELEVATORS! For those complaining about the many stairs- shut up already and find yourself an elevator! Get over it.

4. SOUND SYSTEM AND LIGHTING IS AMAZING\/SPECTACULAR\/AWESOME! What else is there to say? The best in Vegas!

5. ROOM TEMPERATURE WAS PERFECT! For a club that is all indoor, it was not super hot at all! They kept blasting the AC and all dancers loved it!

6. NOT SUPER PACKED\/CROWDED! Compared to Marquee, which is one of the clubs I extremely hate going because it gets so packed that you can't even dance, this club was so spacious, we were able to dance@

7. PRE SALE! PRE SALE! PRE SALE! We got in just fine and dandy! No trouble so I suggest getting pre-sale tickets because it's way cheaper than getting it at the front!

8. SUPERB CUSTOMER SERVICE! All the staffs and bouncers were SO nice! One of the girl host asked if we wanted to take pics and bouncers kindly let us know to throw our drinks out the trash before coming in. It's these little things that make this club awesome!


CONS
1. They don't provide tap water. Water costed $9 for us! That was horrible! So be mindful of that before you go in.

2. The entrance from the club is not so fun! It was kind of quiet the walk. I'm comparing this to Marquee and XS, which is close to entrance door (sort of).",3,3,3

I'm writing this because I miss you. We haven't reunited since August, and it's now October. The last time we met, the Bingo Players (sadly only one bingo player now, poured some out) graced the stage. Before that, we bonded over Calvin Harris. Not to sound like a stalker, Hakkasan, but everything about you is perfect. 
Downstairs (Ling Ling Club): Equivalent to a hip-hop room. Crazy vibe, dancing on every surface, and geisha-style dancers gettin' jiggy. Great spot to hit up for free bottle service before upstairs gets wild. 
Upstairs (Main dance floor): When you enter, there's a large area to your right with a smaller bar and an area with lots of tables and seating areas, with an obstructed view of the stage. Straight ahead is the main dance floor, with large tables in a U-shape around (much like Marquee in this regard). There's another bar to your left, and tables on upper levels. I've never been up there, because I made it my personal goal to dance on the stage. Simply put, the customer service at Hakkasan is unrivaled. Anything you want at a table appears within minutes, any spilled drinks are immediately cleaned up, they even have shirts and shoes if someone spills on you. 
So, Hakkasan, what I'm saying is that you are perfect, without even perfect imperfections. Come back to me.",0,1,1

Got into a big line and waited as a 'guest list' invitee to get into the club and was finally in there when I got assaulted by another guest who was crazy drunk but was a memeber of the 'VIP LIST'. While trying to understand what happened and defend myself I had my arm twisted behind my back and was escorted out of the club before any questions asked. In the 'back stairs' I was rudely asked to explain myself and had little chance to answer while being interrogated by an impatient staff. I was sober and had very little to drink but that didn't seem to stop their rude behavior. After many minutes another staff member came in and showed the 'head of security?' The video footage of what had happened. He immediately backed downs and said the girl who assaulted me was being escorted out of the club and 'what else did I want them to do about the subject?' I have an scratched eye and sore arm from being forced out and not for one second that person thought of apologizing for how his staff treated me and acted superior to me the entire time. This is sad and outrageous. I seriously doubt anything was actually done to the girl who assaulted me and when I asked why did they simply tell her to get out when they saw she assaulted me and I might've wanted to call the cops and have the matter handled properly they said it wasn't their job. But man handling me apparently was. Careful girls... Not a place you want to be at if help is needed and you are not a VIP. Also not one female member on the security team in case you need one.,0,0,0

We went there Saturday to see my favorite dj,  Hardwell,  who by the way is absolutely amazing. Since we couldn't get on the dance floor we had to dance by one of their way over priced bottle service booths. The people who paid for this booth arrived late and didn't stay very long so they didn't even put a dent in the bottle of Grey Goose they paid for. Anyways they saw that my boyfriend and I had been dancing all night so when they were leaving they invited up to make ourselves drinks so the vodka wouldn't go to waste. We thanked them and they left. Not even 5 minutes later the guy that was working that booth came up to us and literally took my drink out of my hand and told me I couldn't have it. I told him the people told us to finish it and have a good night. His response was I don't care you can't have it. Totally rude and so unprofessional.

 At 1:30AM I reached inside my purse & noticed my phone was gone. I went to security & reported a missing phone. Me & my friends searched the floor of the club for a good 30-40mins. I called it quits and decided to head back to my hotel. I figured it was gone forever!!

At 3AM one of my friends phoned ringed & it was MY PHONE!!!!! I quickly answered & it was a man. He told me to return back to the club. I ran back as fast as I could. Once arriving back I saw security guards standing out front & a few of them I remembered speaking to (wish I could remember names). 

One of the security guards took me to a back room. There in the room was another security guard sitting. His name was Brandon. Brandon mentioned to me that there were gentlemen inside the clubs pick-pocketing girls purses. Mine was one of them. 

Here comes another guard walking in with my phone. My jaw dropped. I was in complete shock. I was shocked because my phone was in my hands again!!! I was 100% thankful for Brandon the security guard catching the men!! This guard watched these guys for minutes doing this to these women... And he caught them!

Hakkasan has amazing guards for this!! Not only did these men got caught but they got behind bars!

A consistent 90% of the interactions I had with the staff left me with the impression that they could care less about you (at best). Several interactions both as I experienced myself and that I observed, the security were forceful and bordering on violent in totally uncalled for senerios like telling people where not to stand ect. But then totally missed the boat in others, like failing to keep the random drunk dudes out of our table, and letting people smoke on the dance floor. 

The bottle service girls are okay, and I always had a good positive experience with the bathroom concierge so that was a saving grace.

Here are my observations:

- Extremely hard to walk inside, there was too many people;
- To see the DJ, you better have a table that will cost you at least 3500 dollars;
- 21 dollars for a drink;
- If you are a women,  and can't walk on high hills for all night, forget it (there is no place to seat, unless you have a table);

Came here with a group of 14 girls for a Bachelorette Party. We were on the guest list but still waited in line forever. The lines are extremely long, even getting there at 1030pm so the promoter's lists did absolutely nothing. The positive side was that our group didn't have to pay cover. 

The main dance floor was packed. There was absolutely no space. You couldn't move an inch on the dance floor without getting pushed and shoved against people you don't know. I am not a claustrophobic person and can dance in tight spaces but I couldn't stand being in the main dance floor for more than 15 minutes.

I immediately called my contact to let her know we were outside the club.  She quickly greeted us and escorted us to the entrance of the club and next thing you know we were inside with no wait and with complimentary drink tickets in our hands. SCORE!

The vibe was different this time around. Calvin Harris was absolutely amazing. Ailyne H and I were grooving to the fast beat of techno while our BFs were getting more drinks. Happy Birthday girl! Haha we were chocolate waisted. 

The BF and I agreed that this place was not bad at all. Will we come back? Probably yes! Oh and they now have in and outs which was my complain last time.

Unfortunately, this is only possible on certain dates, usually when the best Djs aren't around.

The club's main area is very large, but it always gets very crowded anyways and particularly so on the Holiday weekends. The shots\/drinks offered by this club are pretty pricey and you should expect to spend a significant amount of money on them if you don't have a table. The tables are also among the most expensive ones in Las Vegas.

When I picked her up I notice that there was 2 securities next to the puddle of water and never said anything to us as we were walking down.

After they heard that we were going to place a  complaint , all the securities decided to gang up on us to kick us out.

He did his usual opening bit, asking what we had planned for the evening, and we answered honestly that we had been offered free drinks\/entry at Tao, XS, etc. and were planning on stopping by as many as we could manage in six-inch heels.  

""Don't bother!"" He cried. ""Let me tell you how this works."" He then proceeded to give us a twenty-minute rundown of how he used to work as a promoter at TAO, how much TAO sucked and how much better Hakkasan was. He also said that he could put us on the ""VIP Guest List"" if we were there by 11, but couldn't promise free drinks because the club was popular enough as it was. Fair enough. 

So we ended up ditching Tao (the free drinks, and our free table) twenty minutes into the night to head to Hakkasan. We got there at 11 pm sharp and saw a line wrapping around the building and going out the back door. ""Good thing we're on the VIP list!"" we said. Funny story - so was everyone else in line. We texted our promoter, and he wasn't even there! He was at XS and he told us to just get in line. 

It took us about an hour to get into the club, and it was so packed that there was no room on the dance floor to do anything but shuffle around. We ended up leaving after half an hour because we were so underwhelmed. The funny thing is that if the promoter we met hadn't boosted our expectations so high with his lies, we might have actually had a decent night there. By then it was too late to get entry into any other club, so we ended up going to Tao and having a great time. 

Not crossing this place off my list completely yet, but doesn't bode well that literally the high point of my experience at Hakkasan was when my friends and I ran to get mozzarella sticks at the Rainforest Cafe to eat while waiting in line.

Like most things in Vegas, venue has an extravagant entrance. Upon arrival you are greeted with an overwhelming line! At least we were. Surely to be expected if you are coming to see Tiesto! I wouldn't have it any other way. There are two lines, VIP and GA (General Admission). There were four in our group. 2 of us got VIP and the other 2 GA. We got split up but the lines went very quickly, we met up inside right around the same time. 

The place was so much fun, and so crowded. There were people everywhere. Not to mention there were like 3 or 4 floors to visit. We didn't get in until a little after midnight. Probably took us about an hour to walk through all the floors and make it to the pit. So cool, we found ourselves literally right in front of Tiesto, arms length away!

When I was at WMC this year in Miami, I saw cab after cab advertising for this place. After a month goes by, I heard many reviews both positive and negative and I thought the only way to find out is to go see it for myself. On this particular trip, I will be doing a preview and comparison between two of the newest mega nightclubs that Vegas has built to cater to the EDM crowd.  My other review will be on the Light at Mandalay Bay. 

Located at the MGM Grand, the prime real estate serves as a convenient spot for the South end strip dwellers. Most of the younger crowd ends up staying at hotels around this area to be close to all the clubs without spending a fortune on cabs.  I didn't get checked into my hotel at the Platinum (by Ballys) until 9:30 and somehow I had enough to get changed in my Vegas bests (tie, vest and the whole 9 yards) and still make it to the club by 10:45.  I had a fairly good ratio of females with me and I had already texted my long time host which worked at Wet Republic, Thomas to get me us in.

As I approached the club, it was a zoo surrounding the place. Also the guest list line wrapped around the building and into the hallway where the stores are. Finding Thomas was almost impossible, especially when he caters to mostly the higher end clientele and was probably busy seating one of his 25K min tables that he sold on that particular night. Thomas directed me to someone else that worked the ropes at the front, and he was able to get our group of ladies in smoothly. The process after getting past the ropes didn't last more than 5 mins after the bouncers checked your credentials for entry. 

I physically set foot in the club at about 11:15 PM, and the dance floor was still not crowded. I managed to get a quick tour of the entire place and found a few sweet spots where the bass hit very well. Surprisingly the sound on the dance floor itself is not as loud as the second level. Another thing I notice is that the crowd tends to flow from the right side of the dance floor. If you are entering the dance floor, you would probably have an easier time staying on the left without being bumped into.  By midnight, all bets are off for free movement on the dance floor. 

One of the gripes I read a lot on the other reviews was that there are too many stairs. I did not find this to be an issue at all. If you are comparing the stairs that are at Marquee, these are just baby steps. There is also an elevator that takes you to two places, the exit or the downstairs hip hop room. The guys working the elevator specifically tell you where they are going, so make sure you take the right one.

So finally I decided I had enough with getting bumped into with the sub-standard opening EDM acts, and I went to the hip hop room with Chris, a promoter from Light that I met that night. We took the elevator down and I heard nothing but ratchet music and tons of smoke. People were definitely getting their party on. In the hip hop room there is actual dance space, and it seemed the crowd was able to have more fun. I spent a good 45 minutes down here before it was almost time for main act to come on at the main stage.

When Dada Life finally came on, it seems like the lighting and volume increased and the production value went up. By production, I mean more confetti than ever before. Dada played a very expected set. It wasn't one I haven't heard before from other festivals and clubs. I think the problem with signing resident DJs that play every other week is that they tend to lose interest in changing it up for the crowd. It's probably more of a problem in Vegas now days than anywhere else.

The night came and went. I can't say that it was let down. I also can't say it was mind blowing.  I think the owners really focused on keeping the restaurant element of Hakkasan and left out a few essentials that can probably help put this place over the top. The overcrowding issue tends to occur at clubs converted from restaurants. I.e. Tao nightclub is almost unbearable on most nights with a full house. Hakkasan does have a few places for you to take a breather, only if you know where to look. I would definitely come back. 

PS. I met my favorite day club hostess, Danny at Wet Republic. That, on its own made my night.

Fergie (dj) opened up for him.. as other reviews say.. lots of stairs haha.. had lots of fun!! Calvin didn't come on til 1:30 am I think.. was a really late night for me but awesome overall.

A couple of negatives : Overpriced drinks... I overheard these girls in front ordering 2 drinks and I think they said it was $35. I drank beer and I think it was like $10 each maybe. Also, It's pretty sexist that the Calvin tickets were more than double the cost for the guys than the girls!

The way they present the bottles for the VIP is pretty cool. There just isn't room to dance at all. Drinks are crazy expensive too.

Many, many times, I would be thrown out and I certainly deserved it. Fast forward a decade and in comes Hakkasan. They did an amazing job renovating this spot! But understand that it's still a Vegas mega club. As with all clubs, drinks are not cheap. Please don't come here if you dislike a crowd and EDM. Don't fall for sleezy promoters promising free lines and VIP for you and your friends. Don't think you gave a guy $20 and he's getting 5 people in to see Calvin Harris. Call the club. Talk to a host. They'll take care of you. It's that simple. On non-superstar DJ nights, getting in is relatively easy and you will have a great time. Note: event the 'non-superstar' DJ's are still pretty big in the industry. Once you get in you can't help but take a step back and take a look around... the sound, lights, people, dancers... it's a pretty great place to party. If you're in town, and like clubs, stop by, put on a smile... and D A N C E

It was probably only about 10:30 when we arrived, so it was fairly empty. After visiting Vegas so many times, I've been accustomed to being offered drink tickets or open bar, but there was none of that here. My friends and I felt like we were hiking with all the stairs inside; I thought I was going to fall off.

Once it got a little more crowded, the music didn't get any better. We went to check out the hip-hop room since we prefer that music over EDM, but the lounge was so tiny since the main hip-hop room was closed. There was no room to dance with all the ratchets around us.

I hate that I get unreasonably generous when I'm drunk  to where I continuously buy my group of friends drinks.  I've concluded that I am a ""dependent drunk"".  Meaning that I do not like dancing and drinking alone so I feel the need to make sure everyone except the designated driver is somewhat on the same level.  I do this to myself all the time and I regret it the next morning.

Sidenote that doesn't pertain to that night: Do you have that ""one friend""?  Usually when I go out with a group of friends, there is an unspoken agreement after one person buys a round for the group.  Normally the people that are part of that round of drinks return the favor by also buying a round.  This would continue throughout the night until everyone in that group has bought 1 round.  After that, whoever wants to buy a drink, buys a drink for themselves or for whomever.  However, there is that ""one friend"" that NEVER returns the favor.  This is the same friend that does the same thing every time you go to the bar with them.  Even though everyone in the group has bought a round, this ONE friend drinks all of the drinks but only buys a beer for his\/herself.  What is even more annoying is that the person has a decent job and isn't broke.

Back to my review, the music was good.  Although I would choose a top 40\/hip hop room over house music, I would have to say that the house room was the winner of that night.  Like all Vegas clubs, the drinks are overpriced.  Overall I had a decent time.

1\/3 of my night was spent going up and down the 250+ steps of death.  The entire venue consists of stairs.  Do you want to go to the bar?  Well watch out for the 5 steps.  Do you want to go to the restroom?  Well watch out for the 10 steps.  Do you want to go to the house room?  Well watch out for the 100 steps.  You get what I mean...",13,27,8

Vegas nightlife is over the top, but this was even more insane than I could have imagined. This place was packed though and the drinks were very expensive (even a bottle of water was $8), so pregame or be prepared to pay for your visit. I did not rate this place very highly mainly because of their process of letting people into the club. It is very unorganized and we waited in multiple lines for a couple of hours before we got into the club. Also, we were told that we would not have to pay cover since we were in line before midnight, but this was not the case. When we got to the front, they told us that we still had to pay the cover, so there was a lot of miscommunication between the staff and management. We managed to get the price cut in half (to $33), but I was still upset that they were not clear in their rules. The experience once we got in was great and Calvin Harris was a really great DJ.

I believe there is a problem with the MGM managment (or whoever manages both Hakkasan and their dayclub counterpart Wet Republic) because me and my friends were here on Cinco De Mayo weekend and had a Horrible experience with the Bouncers at both clubs.

Wet Republic:
Line for the girls (we had 8 girls on the guestlist) was over 2 hours.
Line for the guys (3 guys who bought presale tickets) was over 1 hour.
Bouncer tried to kick two of the girls out of line for being 'drunk' when in reality everybody was f-ing sobered up by then cus we were already in line over 2 hours.

Enough about Wet Republic since this a review of Hakkasan.

Hakkasan:
WORST BOuncers EVER.
To be fair we didnt even go inside Hakkasan so i cant say for the club itself, but the REASON we didnt get in is cus of the doucehbag Bouncers.
Generally unpleasant attitude, unhelpful, and they seem to want to just ruin your night as their primary goal.

This one douchebag bouncer would not let one of the girls in our group in for what he thought was a 'fake ID'. This retard clearly doesnt have a brain to process the images his eyes are seeing because she is CLEARLY the person on her ID, the licesnse was Clearly NOT FAKE, she is 26 years old, and weve been to vegas countless of times and have had no problems at all. 

The guys were on the guestlist and yet STILL were required to pay $100!!!! just to get in.
ARE U kidding me, presale tickets are $75 and u charge $100 for a GUESTLIST price? Retarded.

We decided to just bounce and party elsewhere instead of getting ripped off by Hakkasan and their retarded bouncers.

We were on the guestlist (through a FB contest that I won- didnt think 40mns was a big deal). The female staff I approached said ""sorry, the guest list closed at 12am "" and she explained our options were to pay $20 for girls and $30 for guys OR go somewhere else. After two minutes of my group and I discussing our next moves, a male staff approaches us and I explained our situation. This bouncer was courteous enough to tell us since we were on the guest list, we would be able to get in the General Admission line and pay the reduced rate of $10 for girls and $20 for boys (thanks a lot stupid girl). 

The entrance was fully staffed with what appeared to be a lot of people standing around doing nothing. There are separate lines for guest list, general admission and god knows what else, super confusing- no one in either line, this made us worry. We weren't sure if there were any people inside the club and unable to hear the music (due to having to take elevator up to reach club). We all paid and got in without issues. After paying, entering the club itself could not have been any more difficult. I kept asking useless staff that were standing around ""now what? where do we go?"" Disoriented. Dark. 

When we finally found it, to our surprise, the club was packed- possibly way beyond capacity. The dancefloor looked decent sized but we were packed like sardines which made it difficult to dance and difficult to move around the club. Impressive state of the art light system and acoustics for the bass\/sound system still has my ears ringing and deaf. 

The layout has stairs here and there which are not well-lit, the bar area is dark too, and so are the restrooms. Beware, lots of spilled drinks near the bar. We definitely saw plenty people (male and female) fall near bar and on the stairs. 

We were also given conflicting information about the dresscode. It seems on Sunday they are more lax and allow tennis shoes and t-shirts, etc. Our entire party was dressed up and disappointed to see some dressed down. :\/

I did not buy any drinks myself but its Vegas and a club so I'm assuming they are priced just like all the other clubs.

Not sure how it is on other nights but this seemed like the place to be on a Sunday Funday night! If you like EDM, you can dance the night away here. Our DJ's for the night were TJR and Bambi-both amazing DJ's and had the entire crowd jumping and dancing. TJR was definitely having a good time himself- I love when a DJ can relate to his fans and dance and not just stand at a turn table and mix.  

We left after 3am but I was told the club closes between 3am-4am, depending on the night\/crowd. Will return before midnight next time. This place I hear just opened and is competing with Marquee, XS, and Surrender...definitely giving them a run for their money.",0,0,0

Anywho... first time I went to Hakkasan was a Friday night. I arrived really late but I still wanted to go clubbing. So might as well check out Hakkasan. It was around 2:00AM... and I was thinking entrance fee might be cut. But once I got in line... they said the entrance was $80.... wtf WHY IS IT $80 at 2AM when everyone's already inside and basically wrapping up the night?! Ugh... seriously? Welll I had no choice and paid that damn expensive ass entrance (Mind you it was 5 girls, 2 guys uh.. okay should have been like $30) . Walked inside and NO ONE was dancing. The music was okay... but the crowd was HORRIBLE. No one looked like they were having fun. No one drunk. No one trying to just have a good time. Damn.. wtf did Hakkasan put in your drinks? No matter how shitty the club, at least a few people are having fun. I found myself going back and forth between the hip hop stage and main stage, trying to catch some good music and good vibes.

Eventually, I agreed because he said he would give us a table for $1000. So we made an agreement, got each other numbers, confirmed, etc etc etc etc bullshit etc. So I went back up to my room, informed my family, and we all got ready and went downstairs. The MINUTE I get to the table line (mind you, I was still texting the promoter WHILE GETTING READY AND GOING DOWNSTAIRS), he texts me ""bumped all tables to $2500, better go to LIGHT"" What the FUCK?! This story might sound a bit familiar because Anthony P. jotted down my story in his review. He was with me and my family... GOOD JOB HAKKASAN. YOU JUST PISSED OFF TWO DIE-HARD YELPERS.  God.. boy did I loook stupid in front of my family. In the end, we went to LIGHT at Mandalay Bay... thank god my promoter TOMMY pulled through at LIGHT and got us a table for the ORIGINAL price he offered. Thanks TOMMY you were great..... but screw you Hakkasan. You SERIOUSLY came close to RUINING my baby cousin's 21st birthday. 21st birthday... Las Vegas... COME ON. get your shit together.",19,15,9

With that said, tables started at $3k!! Even with the venue being cool... It's not $3k cool! Instead, we got in for no cover and kept in touch with a promoter. After about a hour, we were able to get a table for $1500. Still a crazy high price but it is what it is on a busy weekend. Despite the things the club has going for it (good service and nice venue) I couldn't fully enjoy it with the lame music and insane amounts of people.

It's new and modern with several floors to cater to your type of music.  I would consider this one of the best nightclubs I've attended in years.  Then again I don't go out clubbing as much as I used to.  However, I'm sure this is definitely one of the more well laid out clubs.  

Overall, there was definitely enough space for the large crowd.  My favorite - is the bar staff; well done.  Drinks were popping out left and right, before I finish and BAM, another one in my hands already.   When it flows that fast people generally drink more, funny thing as I know I spent some $$, but where'd all my drinks go.

I still find the club scene in Vegas to be simply crazy - I'm not sure why, but here the concept of money\/value isn't something people think of at all.  The whole ""bottle service"" concept is a complete rip-off and yields massive profits for the clubs.  On the night we went, prime tables for DeadMau5 were going for $4k - that is simply insane.

Back to Hakkasan:
My biggest problem with this club is the layout - each level has an odd layout.  Just finding your way around can be a challenge.  The DJ's were great (DeadMau5 was amazing - you need to check him out anywhere he plays) and I found the service by all of the staff to be very good - the security were not arrogant pricks.  

There is tons of club competition in Vegas and MGM is spending a fortune to lock up high-end DJ talent in the city.  Given the layout of the club however, I'm not sure that bet will pay off for them.",1,0,0

Then you take a bite out of your sandwich and realize you forgot mayonnaise on it. Now, that look of disappointment painted on your face? That pretty much sums up Hakkasan.

Their dance floor is always more overcrowded than any other club and it's impossible to not spill a drink when on the floor. If you have a table, that's a completely different experience. But even then, it wasn't that special. Not for me, anyway. 

No reason to complain about the high prices on drinks, but that's pretty standard on the strip. And I know the clubs are always going to be packed, but at Hakkasan, I feel as though it's more packed than anywhere else I've been compared to the rest of the strip. 

The resident DJ lineup and the DJs that do play put on great shows. Dada Life, Above and Beyond, Steve Aoki and the rest of them put on great shows. But this review has nothing to do with the entertainment, but the club itself.

When we got there like other reviewers said pure CHAOS. When we finally found what line we were suppose to be in we waited for about an hour to get in. When we approached the front of the line the security took one of our friends out of line. (Just turned 21 a few days before. It was her bday weekend) They were questioning her ID because she had lost about 10-15 lbs and her face is a little fatter in her picture. They then proceeded to ask her questions which she answered them all correctly because its really her ID. Then they made her sign her signature to match the ID. They said one of her L's were slanted and it didnt match. Which mind u at the DMV u sign on a computer pad so one paper is always going to be different. He then said Congratulations your not fat anymore but your still not coming in. Really?! 

When talking with them in why would we waste our money on buying tickets if she had a fake ID... one of my friends laughed because this situation was so ridiculous. He then proceeded to say none of us were aloud in. I then asked for my money back. He said we would have to take that up with the site that we bought the tickets. I knew at that point my chances on getting my money back probably weren't very good. 

I tried anyways. I emailed them and explained what happened. She then said they stand by the security guards decision and that she didn't have an accurate form of ID. She won't be refunding our money because she didn't have an accurate ID, and that the other 3 of us were aloud in but chose not to. Actually no, we were told we weren't aloud in after laughing at this stupid situation. So we are out $100 and didn't get to go to the one thing we were most looking forward to. In the end if you lose weight don't buy tickets here because they are too stupid to tell its you in the picture. I felt like we were being harassed. I will never return here.

The club itself is nicely decorated, but small. The main room gets heavily packed. The only time it gets spacious is when you're invited to a table ;[

Now let me begin my night.  Stood in line for 2 hours.  During this crappy wait, they opened another line, for people who were stupidly willing to pay double the cover charge. Hakkasan!  So happy I didn't.  Granted I made friends with a cool dude from L.A., I ended up taking my heels off while in line.  By the time we got into our rat cage of a club, I was really over it.  Had to climb stairs, that you'd find in any building in the emergency stairwell.  Except, these are all black, dimly lit for your falling pleasure.

Ladies (and some men), wearing heels isn't the smartest idea.  Unless you are willing to fork over $3k for some VIP tables, your ass is standing up the whole night.  There's nowhere for you to sit down.  Due to waiting in line so long, I was thirsty, and not in the drunken whore kind of way, like I want H2O.  The bartender serves us water in a half glass, filled with ice to the brim, for get this $5.  It's tap water!!!!!!!!!  Hakkasan!

The club, didn't really get to enjoy it much, because by the time we paid our cover, this place should not have allowed for us to enter.  It was packed beyond capacity.  People almost walking all over each other.  I was afraid of dying in the hallways where the elevators are located.  You can't walk, you are pushed and it's scary being in heels and dehydrated.  Those Hakkasan clubbers don't care, they just want their beats while on E.  The main room is super awesome to the eye, but I just couldn't get a chance to enjoy it's glory.  Over packed to the brim.

Yet everyone still wants to come, the line is wrapped around the wall, and the dance floor is packed!! I'm also pretty sure none of them are taking in to account their drunken behavior and lack of self control while experiencing this beautiful club. 

None the less ....

I went to see Calvin Harris Friday (5\/17\/13) with a few friends. We bought pre-sale tickets and although the line was crazy, once we were checked in it was just a matter of getting our IDs checked and walking in. When we weren't pushing people away who were attempting to cut line after security had told them to get out of line and go to the end. But was even more ridiculous was the amount of people who despite the directions they were given along with the signs that mark the line they should be in, still couldn't figure out where to go. What I found more entertaining than drunk people walking in circles were the stories, or should I say lies people were giving to the girls with the iPads that were taking tickets just so they wouldn't have to go back and wait in the line they should've been in from the beginning (people are really creative!). Looking back on it I'm not sure how those girls get through the night without slapping someone. I know I would. Which is probably why I don't work there.

Once we were all checked in I was extremely grateful for elevators. I don't think my feet would've made it all night without them (thank you Hakkasan builders!). I can agree that the club is a little dark but all this talk of ""no theme"" is funny considering all of the dancers wear buns with chopsticks in them, the hip hop room is called ""Ling Ling"" and if I'm not mistaken the restaurant serves Asian food. But hey who am I to point out the obvious???? I didn't find the drinks to be any more expensive than the rest of the clubs in Las Vegas.

Since it was a Thursday night, there weren't any major DJ's playing at other clubs such as Encore or Marquee. After finding out Jauz was playing here, we decided to go for Hakkasan and get on the guest list (thanks Jesus!). The plus side was that Hakkasan was directly in our hotel, so we thought it was convenient that we didn't have to pay $$$ for an uber or walk in 100 degree weather.

I was a little skeptical before going due to bad reviews. However, the guest list went by fast in my opinion. It was very easy and took about 20 minutes. The club is accessible through the elevator inside. The atmosphere was very nice. The visuals, lights, and special effects were awesome. We managed to get a good spot all night, right in the middle of the stage. The dance floor looked straight up packed and I can only imagine how hard it would be to breathe in there. I was thankful for our spot and that we didn't have to deal with any rowdiness or pushing.

The bar line went by pretty fast, however, the drinks are very pricey (but what do you expect in Vegas tbh). I also paid about $43 for two drinks which made me cry in the inside.

1) As expected for a Vegas club be prepared to wait in line wether it be prepaid, guest list, or general admission 
2) If there is a big DJ spinning purchase pre sale tickets (guy tickets sell out before girl tickets)
3) Guest list does not guarantee admission, we were on a guest list after being unable to purchase pre sale male tickets, waited over 2 hours, still had a bit of a line in front of us and were told ""you may get in on time to see Calvin Harris""

As for my night at Hakkasan, I was really looking forward to seeing Calvin Harris here on my first night in Vegas, as a matter of fact I was planning on proposing to him just because I love him that much haha. However, my dreams where ruined after waiting over 2 hours and deciding to go somewhere where we could enjoy a party from the inside instead of the line. As per many Yelpers recommendations my friends and I went to XS, end up seeing Rusko and had a blast!",3,1,0

I see reviewers commenting on the pickpocketing problem and I can definitely see how it could happen on the dancefloor. You are pretty much pressed up against everyone around you. My purse got caught on some guy's belt and he freaked out as I kept trying to untangle myself, thinking I was trying to either pickpocket or molest him (neither.. sorry, buddy!) I also didn't like how they forced us to check our coats prior to entering. Even the big European guys next to me were complaining about how cold it was. When you're a girl in Vegas, chances are you aren't wearing much. How dare they make me take off my mini jacket that didn't even have a back! I was super freezing and annoyed, but at least it helped us figure out a way to sneak our friends to the front of the line of the club. Ha! In yo face, Hakkasan!

Once we were inside, it wasn't that bad. The music was awesome as we went on a night Calvin Harris was spinning. Hip hop room downstairs was super fun, playing all the old school jams. And despite my own sloppy friends spilling a round of drinks on me, we were troopers and stayed until the wee hours of the morning. I'd go again, but probably not in the summertime as I'm sure it'd be even more crowded and stuffy. No thanks.",6,5,3

Arrived at 10:00, and the line extended all the way outside the door. At about 11:30pm, we wasn't sure if we were going to make it, so we asked one of the guys ushering and yelling at the ladies (yes, 95% ladies) to stand in single filed lines how long they estimated the wait would be. I had a promoter that could've gotten us into other places - Light, XS, Tryst, Marquee - for free if the Hakkasan line was too long, BUT I had to tell him before 12:30pm. The guy told us 45 minutes, so we were like, oh, okay, that's not too bad.

We freaking waited for 3 hrs. Apparently, the issue was because the club was at maximum capacity, sine they tried to fit about 4000 - 6000 people into the club. Alright, I guess if the club is amazingly gorgeous, it would've been worth the wait, but when I went in, my first thought was ""... really?""

SO many stairs, why the heck are there so many stairs even on the dance floor??? Absolutely nowhere to sit at all, we couldn't even go to the front to see Calvin Harris because they had tables there and they were blocked off for the rich and mighty. And after a 3 hr wait, our feet were killing us so badly we couldn't even enjoy the music and left after an hr. 

No, no, no no no.

The only good thing was that some girls working there were handing out white chocolate balls with ice cream. Other than that... me sad, me miss XS, me go there next time. It would've been great to see Harris, but honestly, when I'm drunk, I can't tell whether the DJ is Harris or Boi2chainz.",8,11,3

It's actually a pretty spread-out club, meaning halls and nooks, but as far as the dance floor goes...small. 
Prepare to get your ass knocked down if you try and make your way on the dance floor. Since everyone is drunk and going wild on the floor, you will get knocked down. The fact that I fell twice, and no men helped me up after they were strictly the reason for me falling over, was disgusting to me. 
The bathrooms were well-kept though. I've experienced a lot of nasty club bathrooms, especially in Vegas, but these were surprisingly very clean. 
I actually kind of like the fact that it wasn't a normal layout for a club, it wasn't one huge, high-ceiling one-big-room, club. It was kind of like a maze. Upstairs, downstairs, hallways, and isles. But dark, very dark, especially upstairs. There were a lot more men than I expected though, probably an even ratio, which surprised me. 
The music was good though, the DJ never stopped, he played an intense set the whole night. We spent a lot of time upstairs because you can see most everything from up there and it wasn't near as crowded as downstairs.

To be honest, if you embrace how Vegas works, there's nothing too out of the ordinary about Hakkasan. It's not your usual city club. I've had more trouble trying to get into a club in Houston than in Vegas. Play by the rules and you'll be FINE. Gentlemen: wear leather shows, slacks, or nice jeans (darker the better), and something with a collar whether its a shirt or a blazer. You have to look the part and you won't get denied. Remember they're trying to promote ""upscale, trendy, nightlife"" not ""#brolife"" Ladies, you have so much freedom with what you can wear so I don't think I need to comment on it. 

As for drinks, hell yeah they're going to be expensive! It's VEGAS. A red bull costs 6 bucks from my hotel and a mini bottle of goose (50mL) costs $12. So it's gonna be pretty bad when you're trying to buy drinks at a club. We were pleasantly surprised with a round was only $72 (3 Long Islands and a Patron shot).

Now on to playing the game, the dance floor is reserved for VIPs, people picked by promoters, or people who have money for the bouncers. If you are none of these three then you can't get to the dance floor. Bam, hang out on the decks. Lol it's actually nicer there I think. We were on the main dance floor and it got pretty balmy pretty quickly. I was praying for the CO2 jets which weren't coming soon enough.

Anyway, embrace Vegas. This is how it is at every club (unless you go to the smaller ones that aren't packed to the brim) so don't think Hakkasan is completely evil.

We came here for my dad'd birthday around Mother's Day weekend, and we REALLY enjoyed ourselves here.  It was super huge and well ventilated, so my group wasn't all sweaty and hot like in most other clubs.  We were right up front with the DJ Bingo Players, and I had a really good time here.  There was a room for trance\/house and another for hip hop lovers.  As it turned out, we ran into someone there with a table so we got to rest our toesies at their table.  It did take a while for us to get in even though we pre-bought tickets, but I would say it was only a 20 minute wait.  That was the only drawback really.  If you pre-bought tickets, you shouldn't have to wait like the rest of them.  The lights show was great, the crowd was energetic, and it was very well decorated.

Now on to this night's review...Haven't done the Sunday night thing in a Vegas club ever, but last night took a chance and went to Hakkasan courtesy of Dave Verosa (promoter - https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/dave.verzosa?fref=nf  (702) 481-5951) and we were so beyond glad we did. First things first, it is Easter Sunday night, not expecting a big crowd and there wasn't one. But, that turned out to be great because we explored the club something impossible on a crowded night. I found 2 more bathrooms - major plus!! Went into the Ling Ling Lounge for the 1st time and it was really cool. Lots of little table and couches to sit on and you didn't have to pay to sit (maybe that is only on a slow night, but didn't care - my feet were happy). About midnight they closed the lounge so upstairs we headed.

OMG the DJ was killing it; not Fergie yet, might have been DJ Shift, unsure. About 1:00am Fergie came on and the club went to a whole 'nother level. The light show as incredible, the videos played were memorizing and the combination of solid beats mixed with classical throwback snippets and current tracks really made the evening flow effortlessly. Wish you could post video after the fact on here, but I'll add some links and you can see for yourself! He  even managed to get a 2:30am crowd to sing acapella 3 lines from Seedish House Mafia Don't You Worry Child without missing a word - TWICE! ... and ""the City of Vegas"" add in was hysterical and fired up the crowd in a great way.

https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/video.php?v=10205988172524987&set=vb.1280702242&type=3

Actually went up to the 5th floor for the 1st time. We usually nest in on the Pavilion Level back by the wall. I am fairly attached to the wall and like it there. Plenty of airflow, easy bathroom access and good lighting. The 5th floor was very cool actually. Really big tables\/booths overlooking the stage and dance floor. You can also look down on to the white couch area on the 4th floor from here. They closed down this section around midnight and everyone went to the main dance floor area on the 4th floor which was perfectly fine with us.

We found a great spot where we could see everything and I could occasionally sneak a seat for a few minutes; can't ask for more than that. Spoke to a couple security guys over the course of the night and picked up a few tips etc. When it's busy no way you can talk to them, but tonight was different. Once they merged everyone down to the main floor, the club felt packed and the energy raced.

We saw our all time favorite security guy - Will. Why is he our favorite? Because we watched him very quickly, professionally and quietly handle a bad situation last year without being a jerk and without disrupting other people dancing around somewhat oblivious to the situation. He also helped me out when I had to navigate from out table main floor center to the bathroom and back on a Steve Aoki night. Thanks Will, you are awesome!!  He has a great smile and represents the club really well; no BS guy, don't test him, but not a jerk at all. Something hard to come by in most clubs sadly. I can't imagine how hard it is to deal with thousands of wasted people in a club with a zillion stairs, sliding walls, flashing lights... security there does a good job. We're fun and friendly, so we probably have less negative encounters with security than our 20-something counterparts.

Dada Life was the headliner. 

Pros: Aesthetics-wise, this nightclub is just as nice as any other. There's a nice lounge with benches for sitting without having to get bottle service. There's three different levels and plenty of space, except the main stage. 

Cons: Stairs - apparently these are death for the ladies. There's no outdoor patio\/pool area so it can get stuffy, but there's cool jets that blast the crowd every once in a while. Confetti is dropped every now and then, but the pieces stain your skin, especially the blue ones! The cost of a drink is ridiculous - a Red Bull\/vodka was $25.

I noticed right away when I was about to drink but I didn't think of it right away until 15 minutes later. Yes I was hella buzzed. But no, that give you no right to take advantage of a drunk person and plain out lie about giving back their credit card (which he didn't).

It was super crowded and impossible to move around, mind you it was a Wednesday. I sat down, where I saw others sitting and the bouncer came over to tell me to get off. After a few hours I took off my shoes, and the bouncer came over and told me I could have them off as long as I wasn't going to be walking around, I told him I wasn't going anywhere and he said okay and walked away. 10 min later, another security guy came over, grabbed my arm and said ""put your shoes on right now!"", I explained to him the other guy said it was okay and he said ""I'm his boss, you have exactly ONE minute to put your shoes on, I'M COUNTING"" Super rude, he didn't have to talk to me like that, I then grabbed all 7 of my friends and we left.

They both said it would be 1k specifically for a bottle of goose & Hennessy. We get to the table reservation line and Kevin the promoter was the biggest jerk I ever worked or come across in all my years of clubbing.  Omg, he didn't know we were on his list and was being plain rude before finding out we're on his list of table reservations.  So far, I'm already irritated.  Don't treat the people who are the reason you have a job like that whether you ""think"" they're on your list or not. Told us to be there at 10 & we didn't get in til past 11. 

The gentlemen who walked us in was nice but informed it was $1075 for both the bottles.  Ok, $75 more than we spoke to the promoters about. No big deal on the price difference but a big deal on the principle.  

After we get seated, hostess brings out two bottles, Fiji water and redbull with my $1800+ bill. WTF??? At this point, I'm ready to bounce.  She explained they don't have anything but Hennessy black. Once again, trickery.  Long story short, she brought out regular Hennessy, took away waters and redbull, never brought me back my receipt or credit card after I signed like she said she would.

I ""heard"" whoever opened hakkasan did it to provide guests with great service, mark my words, I won't be back.  The ambiance was alright and if we didn't have a booth we would've left because it was way over crowded. 

Called hotel & club the following day to be put on hold and repeat my personal info a few times to have no luck or apology for losing my card.  So annoying to spend $1600+ and be treated like shit.  So overrated, had so much more fun at light with free drink cards and no booth.

I wish I could tell you how the show was, but I honestly don't even remember if we saw any of it. The only proof I have that we MAY have seen any of the show is a 15 second video on my phone. Oh, Vegas... So I suppose this will be a review of the nightclub itself -- or what I can remember of it.

Our group was pretty evenly matched up in terms of girls and guys, but luckily our birthday girl had managed to land free table service through her promoter for us ladies (and a few of our guys) right by the dance floor. They brought us two bottles and ""made"" us drinks (mixed what I think was vodka and various juices\/soda water together into a glass). The table we sat at had storage areas under the seats for those of us who wanted to stash a purse or clutch, or anything else besides which was super convenient.

Every staff member I encountered (guards, bouncers, bartenders, bathroom attendants, the girls who worked the tables for table service) was very polite and friendly. I don't know why this place got so many bad reviews for service. Maybe because we went during a slower week night? And because we had gotten there a little early?

We got there pretty early (between 9PM-10PM), so it was still a pretty relaxed atmosphere. It's bigger than it looks, with a second bar tucked over on the far side of the dance floor. I never personally found it to be terribly overcrowded. And a margarita cost me $14 (eeek, Vegas prices).

We did, unfortunately, lose our table because apparently we had ""too many guys,"" so they sold the table away to another party. Without warning us first (so far as I know anyway). That was a little upsetting, but what can you do in a city where having a vagina trumps all? At one point during the night, a guard had even physically stopped my boyfriend from approaching the table (put a hand on his shoulder and held him back from the table), and the only explanation the guard had was that there were too many guys there. Even though he was one of the original guys in the group who the the table had been reserved with.",0,1,0

My friends and I have had a multitude of terrible experiences at Hakkasan. I know why do I keep coming back right? Because they have the most popular DJs I'll give them that, but also because I unfortunately, trust too wholeheartedly. 

I contacted the promoter, Peter Nguyen (avoid this promoter like the plague), and he was willing to help my friends and I get in for free with table service. However, we showed up on Friday night and he said that we would be found. The catch was he didn't even know what we looked like. We ended up being packed in like sardines on the dance floor, while guys were shoving and punching us! It also took us DAYS to get on and the same amount to get off. 
Then on Saturday night we went back because he apologized and promised unlimited table service. When we texted him that we were here, he said made up some bullshit excuse that he couldn't come get us for another 2 hours, so we waited. When the clock struck 12:30 am, we texted him and he failed to reply. We were left feeling stupid yet again.

I gave both Ling-Ling (bottom hip-hop floor) and Hakkasan a chance, and needless to say, I'll most likely not be coming back to this terrible and overly crowded club.

The only complaint I have concerns their ""no re-entry"" policy which nobody tells you about until you find yourself outside the club to meet a friend, while all of your shit is inside, with some asshole getting in your face telling you that you have to wait half an hour to get back in. They tend to waive this policy if you are persistent enough in your argument and\/or have a table, but a lot of people without tables never get back in, which sucks if this is something they didn't know about before going out. 

I also saw a security guy force two women to take off and check in their jackets, while they didn't tell us that we had to take off our jackets.

You do taste nothing short of chic and glamour once you step in. Yeah, it's dark with a lot of stairs but there are also elevators if you're not impatient to wait for it.

It was just us three girls, so getting in was no problem. It's always best to plan ahead and find a promoter who can hook you up so you don't have to worry about waiting in line or paying. 

Came in around 10:30 and the place is of course, not too packed. They have three floors I believe. Ladies, bring flats because it is a bitch going up and down those damn stairs with heels (unless drink enough alcohol to numb the pain away). The second floor plays hip hop (the dj ain't all that great), and the main floor is where they play edm. They also have an elevator that takes you to the different floors. Still bring flats ladies! Dr. Soles has some good ones. 

Drinks are of course pricey, it's Vegas...what do you expect. But they are not stingy with the amount of alcohol they put. Thank you!! :)

However, once it got a little later the club became completely packed. We couldn't move anymore. Maybe NV doesn't have the same kind of fire safety laws that CA has because there were all kinds of fire hazards going on. 

We stayed on the dance floor for as long as possible because we really wanted to be out there for Tiesto, but it became unbearable. The club decided it was a good idea to throw bracelets out into the crowd when it was at full capacity so people were jumping all over the place trying to catch them. A very large man landed on my foot after jumping up and shortly after that I got hit on top of the head twice. The pain was too much so we had to get off the dance floor which was near impossible. I had to literally elbow people to get through. Once we got back to the stairs we had to shove people even more. It was awful. What if I had been seriously injured? I was really disappointed with the way our night ended because we were having so much fun. We ended up going up to one of the higher levels and watching Tiesto for about 10 minutes. Definitely a bummer. 

Coming here is a catch 22 if you want to see the headlining DJ of the night. You either get there early and hold your spot on the dance floor for as long as possible or you wait til later when the lines are long and you have to fight to even get down the stairs.

Pre-sale tickets male $100 \/ Female $40

I had high hopes for Hakkasan. I went with my girlfriend and we were disappointed with everything except the music. Steve Aoki and Deadmau5 were the only thing that saved the night. Every single force outside of them was trying to ruin our night.  After an amazing memorial day weekend at Wet Republic with Tiesto and Marquee Day\/Night club for Kaskade, Hakkasan was just... lacking.

The Bad:
- We had pre-sale tickets, yet we were forced to wait 2 hours to get in. This is not an exaggeration, if you show up at 11:30, you're going to have a bad time. Once we were inside we saw that there was plenty of room to walk around and there was absolutely no reason for the wait. I've been to XS and Marquee with both table service and pre-sale tickets and I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes to get in. This was a terrible way to start off the night. When we finally did get in, Steve Aoki was just coming on at 1:30. Later after talking with a few other friends who got in through the guest line, we found out that they only had to pay $70 and they got in at the same time as us. Why did I spend $100 for my ticket to be let in at the same time?

- The drinks were absolutely terrible and they cost $18+. At one point I just gave up and just ordered a screwdriver, biggest mistake. The OJ was not fresh, it was watered down minute maid garbage. For a club that promotes the best of the best, how do you fuck that up?

- Water cost $9 and they give you an extremely small bottle. It was the end of the night, I finished my bottle of water but I needed more. After dropping $300 on drinks and closing out, I didn't feel like opening a new tab for another $9 bottle of water. I decided to fill up my bottle in the bathroom and the attendants start griefing me. I throw a dollar in their plate but they say they're going to get security. I've never seen a bathroom attendant freak out over water before in my life. I stopped, apologized, and threw away the bottle, but the attendant walks out with me and tells a security guard what went down. The security gave zero fucks about the water because I threw it away already and I just kept walking. Why are there 4 bathroom attendants in such a small space? Why do they care if you drink tap water from a bottle you already paid for? 

- The layout is completely wack. They close off the dance floor if it gets too crowded and then the people standing at the tables surrounding the dance floor completely block everyone's view. I have no problem with the dance floor being closed off, it's just where do you go once it's closed? Everything is tables everywhere. I actually felt bad for the tables not lined along the dance floor though. Their view was almost completely blocked by people standing on tables, people in between the isles, and pillars that are supporting the structure. The sound also does not carry very well to tables in the back. Be warned, those tables in the back dropped at least $10,000 and they had a blocked view of the stage and the sound was average at best. We tried to see if we could get a better view from the top floor, but the balcony is lined with tables as well. In the end they opened the dance floor back up for Deadmau5 and we were able to go down and watch. 

- Stairs and ramps everywhere. I saw 4 girls slip and fall throughout the night. Two of them were on the ramp going down to the dance floor and the other two slipped on stairs but caught themselves before completely falling. Be careful girls.

The Good:
-The Talent. In the past 5 years I've seen Steve Aoki a total of 11 times. It's been amazing watching his music and his sets grow to what it is now. It was an epic set and he absolutely killed it. Deadmau5 was also absolutely amazing. He played a lot of new chill tracks for the first hour. Then he put on his gold mousey helm and started rockin with his old stuff. These guys were the only reason to be there.

-The people there, everyone we met was really friendly and dressed to the 9s\/10s.

-The energy level of the crowd during Aoki's set. But you can get this at any of the top clubs in Vegas.

Summary:

The amount of money spent by myself and everyone around us should be more than enough to fix the quality of the drinks, the lines, and the attitudes of the people working there. These are 100% management problems and can easily be corrected. I want to like Hakkasan, I enjoy the idea that there's an upscale club with my favorite artists playing every weekend. But I can't recommend this to anyone. I think we'll wait for a while before returning.

Side note, we saw Tito Ortiz there. I checked out his Twitter account and it looks like he got the shaft as well with his table service. He waited for an hour, they charged him 40% gratuity, and they didn't let half of his crew in. If a guy like Tito gets bad service, what are you going to get? http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/qgm5vn5",7,2,1

First off there were three lines for this place and the bouncers\/security or whoever they are were very rude..... Those first two lines were pointless! 

Once we were inside it was over-crowded, despite the fact that there are several levels. They pack so many people in this place it's actually a safety hazard, it's very difficult to navigate through and explore the different levels at this place.

I would recommend getting bottle service just because the price of the drinks were very expensive, but it's Vegas what did I expect!! 

I can't say this place is all bad. The music and surround system was nice, not too loud that you couldn't have a conversation. The lasers were really cool, I was kind of amazed lol.

My wife and I went here last year, and we had a GREAT time inside the club!

Why the one-star review? 

Because the security people who run the line are both CLUELESS\/DUMB, as WELL as mean\/brutal.

Personally, we didn't have a problem.  But, the two parties around us (one was foreign, and didn't know English well -- the other person was a bit drunk) got HARASSED and kicked around like trash.  Brutal!    I don't approve, because:  1) Foreign (non-English speaking) -- cut them a break, for crying out loud!  Just because they don't know every rule in the book doesn't mean to yell them and them and then brutalize them because they can't understand your aggressive & fast English!  2) Drunk person -- was honestly just clueless, and needed a little guiding.  NOT aggressive or a jerk.  But they took advantage of this person to brutalize him and kick him around like trash.

Again, we had smooth sailing, and we kept our mouths shut.... we had a great time inside, and saw Kaskade.  

BUT -- this place does not earn \/ gain my respect.  They deserve no more than 1 star for their treatment of people (aka abuse by security\/bouncers, etc. who have VERY low self esteem, and are NOT smart people -- at least the ones we saw when we were there).   I'm actually guessing that this place probably breaks some sorts of laws in the ways they discriminate\/treat people, so they'd better be careful, because other people (not me, because I don't have the time or energy) might sue\/investigate them.",0,0,0

The door people\/bouncers\/managers---All were super nice. Gaz was awesome!!! 

The club itself---Beautiful club! Super cute and multiple bars everywhere. I never once had to wait in a long line to get a drink..Or shall I say my free drink that was given to me from management. Yes I know girls get what they want in Vegas but not every girl gets that lol.

The music: It is what it is. Tiesto was on that night. I am not a huuuge house fan so obviously I left the club sooner than later but that doesn't make it a crappy club.

My response to the terrible reviews this place was given:

Umm..Your stuff was stolen??? Duh! You are in LAS VEGAS in one of the hottest clubs on the strip! Be smart and hold on to your stuff!! Of course it will get stolen!! No matter how wasted you get, you should always keep an eye on your personal belongings! 

""It's too packed"": LMAO AGAIN, You are in VEGAS!!!! EVERY club will be packed!! Knock it off! 

""The drinks were over priced"": DUH!!! Starbucks in Las Vegas is overpriced. lol!! Again, be smart, think, hmmm maybe prices are through the roof because I am in the MGM GRAND in Vegas.... Ding Ding!!! Light bulb! 

I really had no reason to not like this place. I thought it was cool. It sucks that I paid for a ticket, then ended up getting in for free and cannot get a refund, but that's my fault. I agreed to the terms.

I mean i sympathize with them that they have deal with drunk princesses or folks out of town that are too rowdy, however it is Vegas. This is when being rowdy is obligatory. 

The DJ that night was playing a mixture of hip-hop and EDM. Don't get me wrong I love both, but transitions were awful. One moment you a nodding to Two-Chains and next moment you are slow dancing to deep trance. I am sure I went on an off night, and there are other nights, other DJs are much better. I was just expecting a little too much of my first time at Hakkasan. 

Please correct me if I a wrong. The reason why they don't offer tap water at Hakkasan is because the water system in Nevada in general sucks butt. I am spoiled by Bay Area water so free tap water seems to be natural.

The stairs didn't bother me. I'm a guy in fine shape with flat shoes. But I can see how ridiculous they can get for girls. Hakkasan would recoup their $120 million quite a bit faster if they figure out an efficient people mover. 

Drinks were drinks. But it was hilarious that whenever anyone asked for a water (my friend included) they immediately pulled a mini Fiji from the fridge and charged $9. Ha! People talk about alcohol markups. Where's the furor over this?!

The line moved quite well and waited not even 5 minutes. This was before midnight, though, so I can't attest on how they move people along during the ""rush hour"". But what blew my mind was that this was a club staff I did not hate. Really. I'm not sure if this is by chance or if the parent company of Hakkasan intentionally hired a friendly club staff, but holy shit could this revolutionize clubbing. Make people feel comfortable?!

The one major drawback is the dancefloor. Holy smokes you could hardly call this a dancefloor. 1) it was small and 2) so packed you could hardly dance.

The answer was unanimous: Hakkasan!  I was kind of hesitant because it's one of the newer, and at the time, less established clubs compared to the rest but everyone urged me to go as it was the newest and largest clubs in Vegas.  Hakkasan is both a restaurant and night club located in the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino. 

The club consists of multiple levels and has world famous DJ's spinning live on the main dance floor.  They have a very efficient check-in process and security is pretty tight.  If you know a club promoter, have him\/her put you on the guest list.  If you're on the guest list, the cover charge for ladies is waived and the cover charge for men is still high but discounted.  The first time we went to Hakkasan, my boyfriend's cover charge was $25 and I got in free. The second time we went to Hakkasan was on Halloweeen so they totally jacked up the cover charge for men to $75 and I still got in free. Go figure. 

Naturally, the guest list line moves quicker than the regular entry line but both lines tend to get really long and because security is tight, there will definitely be a long wait, even on slow nights.  If you're on the guest list, they double check your name on their iPads then your ID and get stamped. You then walk through security and the cashier and you then get stamped once more.  After this, you wait a little while longer for security to let you in through either a set of elevators or the staircase (the stairs get utilized more on busy nights).  

They have a nice lounge on the 3rd floor and it's usually more laid back than the main dance floor.  The 5th floor is filled with tables for bottle service and serves as a balcony overlooking the DJ and the main dance floor.  There are also tables for bottle service on the bottom floor, surrounding the dance floor. They have multiple bars throughout the entire club and have received excellent customer service from every bartender that served us.  Despite how busy they were, they know how to work quickly and still put a smile on their face all the while.  

The DJ's are amazing. I was lucky enough to be there on nights where Calvin Harris and Steve Aoki were deejaying.  The club also does confetti drops over the dance floor.  I'm sure we'll be back the next time we're in Las Vegas, it's always a good time at Hakkasan!",6,1,6

I've been to the club three times now..for Dada Life, Tiesto, and Calvin Harris. Long story short, unless you have a table, your experience will pretty much be you pushing your way through to get anywhere or being pushed whilst defending your standing space. At one point I was literally pinned in the middle of a crowd of people in a walkway like a damn herd of cows. It's also pretty miserable for the ladies because unless you roll up in flats (like that'll happen),come at 10pm, and are willing to stand in your pumps until the headlining DJ comes on at 1:30am, you're gunna have a crappy spot, likely in the back of the club or off to the sides.

Sweet baby Jesus. Thank goodness I remembered from experience. Girls, take off your shoes before you decide to climb up and down the gazzillion floors that is Mt. HK. I've heard so many horror stories about women breaking their legs and spraining their ankles. Not cool. You either need more elevators that are open to people going up, or you need to install an escalator and just conveyor belt us around. 

Bring flats. Ain't no party like a leg in a cast for two weeks partyyyyyy 'cuz a leg in a cast party don't end up with nothing but a wheelchair.


The only places to stop and rest is at the smoking area. Great, thanks a lot guys. You mean I get the privilege to have people blow smoke in my face? Urgh. Even Marquee has a couch. I'm not about to throw down a few thousand dollars for table service just so I can sit, though the people I was with definitely wanted to 30 minutes in.

They do have nice productions with all their lights and visuals, including performances by girls dressed in brightly colored costumes performing a choreographed dance on a small stage behind the DJ above the crowd.  Nothing as elaborate as Light.  The dance floor is pretty small. A lot of VIP tables.  The second floor is the mezzanine which overlooks the dance floor and DJ, and there's a third floor with the Ling Ling room where hip hop is played.  The club itself seems pretty big because there's room to roam about. Ladies, wear comfy shoes as there is no area to rest your feet unless you have a VIP table, and there are a lot of stairs.  Great venue for EDM but not as elegant as XS.  Both guest list lines and general admission lines are freaking long (they probably hold the line to make it look like its super poppin inside) so allow for early arrival so you can enjoy a little of the club before it gets too packed with sloppy drunk people.

Went in November Weekend Friday- Steve Aoki SUPER PACK, it was his birthday lines looks like it's about an 2 hours wait. 

Tiesto Saturday - SUPER BEYOND PACK!

A couple of folks came to the end of the line to let us know how long the wait was going to be and what our options were. We remained in the line and although it took about 45 minutes before we got itn, it kept moving and was always organized.

Once we got in, we headed to the bar for some standard overpriced drinks. Hakkasan has a similar set up to many clubs in Las Vegas - medium sized dance floor surrounded by a semi-circle of tables. The only thing was there was essentially only one way down to the dance floor and it was extremely crowded.

I was pleasantly surprised that Zedd came out before 1am. He was great from the start and kept the energy up. Lil Jon was made an unexpected appearance and he is so good at getting the crowd going. I had a fun night and Hakkasan has awesome performers every night and you can't go wrong!",1,1,2

My first time was a couple years back to see Calvin Harris. I haggled with the bottle service host at the door to ""be allowed"" a $2,000 min for 4 people. The table we were given was so far back, that I couldn't even see the DJ. There was no security protecting us from random people crashing our party and it was by far the worst bottle-buying experience I've ever had. 
About a year after that horrible experience, I got dragged into this club again by some friends that wanted to see a particular EDM artist. This time I knew better than waste money on bottles, so we just paid for entry and purchased drinks inside. As I roamed around the nightclub, I wondered ""how was this club the most expensive one to build in Vegas?"" Once again, not impressed by this place during round 2.
My 3rd and final attempt to have a good time here was last weekend. I actually had a comped suite at MGM because I do a fair amount of large wagering at the Mlife properties. Even as a hotel guest with an upper tier players card and name on a VIP guestlist, I was turned away at the door because it was LITERALLY 1:01am and that's when they evidently close those lists. I then told the person guarding the door, ""Hey, it's my friends birthday and their plane was delayed. We got here as fast as we could. We will happily come in and buy your expensive drinks for the next 3 hours, or we will have to default back to my room and break open our own bottle... since it's only 1 minute after cutoff, can you let it slide this time?"" They then basically repeated ""the line closed at 1:00"". 
This club is the worst. I will never be back here again.

In case you were wondering: (1) R3hab, (2) Hardwell, (3) Calvin Harris, (4) Hardwell (again!), (5) Oliver Heldens, (6) Tiësto. I swear every time I come here, my ability to stand this club decreases more and more to the point that I can't even. In case that didn't come through, I REALLY CAN'T EVEN.

If you wanted to spend a truckload of money on how to create the most confusing, annoying, and quite frankly physically dangerous club in the world, come to Hakkasan! Narrow corridors that people can barely maneuver through. Bar areas with low ceilings that literally have no space to mingle without feeling claustrophobia. A dance floor where I have to warn everyone that's never been to Hakkasan to watch their stuff because that dance floor is notorious for valuables getting jacked. And I said it last time and I'll say it again, NO OUTSIDE AREA! Is this a club or is this an Egyptian pharoah's tomb? Because it sure seems like a tomb, that's for sure. And those DAMN STAIRS! I wonder how many twisted\/broken ankles those stairs have accounted for...not to mention people falling flat on their asses. Hell, I've been here enough times and I've still almost fell on my ass last time I was here.

Even if I were to consent to coming back here again, I have 100% zero desire to even go on that dance floor anymore. Unless, of course, I want to feel like a sardine packed in a can...because that is obviously very very very comfortable! The only somewhat bearable part of this club is the 5th floor balcony level because it's the only spot that even has some semblance of breathing room. All I know is this...the last time I came here, I rolled with 20 people and NONE OF THEM want to come back. Sample size notwithstanding...yeah, you don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure out where I'm going with this. Let's not even get started on how ""friendly"" all the people that work there are.

I gave Hakkasan many shots, only because my favorite artists were exclusive to here. And now that Sir Calvin is now at Omnia too, well, the only reason I have left to come here is Mr. van der Corput (because he's my fave) OR if it's Thursday (because it ain't packed to ridiculous levels). Otherwise, I ain't gon deal anymore man. I only hope that Omnia fixes all the problems Hakkasan has, because this club needs a total makeover ASAP.",17,7,3

Now I don't have a problem walking to where I need to get to when I'm in Vegas, mainly because you can have a drink in your hand the whole time. But if you've got women in your group with you, those heels begin to betray their owners after a quarter mile because let's be honest, looking sexy comes with a price with those heels.

The nightclub itself is a very, very nice venue. The interior is sweet, the lights and lasers that have made non-EDM acts at Coachella look like crap are all there as well complete with massive confetti and cold air blasts. My only gripe with Vegas is the lack of dance floor at the several nightclubs this city has to offer. When I go to a nightclub, I want to boogie, not blow thousands of dollars to have people stare at me while I get presented bottles (I would recommend bottle service to those who haven't tried it, it's just something you've got to experience at least once. There's nothing wrong with stroking your ego once in a while to make you feel awesome, just be polite about it). 

Now because this place is the new, hot venue in Vegas with the exception of Drai's reopening, everybody and their mommas and her church friends want to go to Hakkasan. They spend millions of dollars on a massive marketing campaign to display their roster to the public, and their talent is pretty top notch with some heavy hitters (Calvin Harris, A&B, Hardwell, Tiesto). With this, also comes about a 25-33 percent increase in prices all-around from drinks to entry. If you're going to complain about Vegas having 20 dollar drinks, than you probably should've never gone in the first place honestly. This place isn't cheap, they expect you to drop hundreds if you don't have a booth, and you might even have to fork over a couple hundred just to get in if you didn't get a pre-sale ticket or arrive with a small army of girls.

The reason they got 2 stars is because this nightclub has a miniscule-sized dance floor, booths that dominate the views of the DJ booth, and beyond that, you're just kind of shafted because you've spent a couple hundred to get in and have a drink in your hand. You have no views of the DJ you came to see, even worse, the view is just of people celebrating at their tables. IF you're getting table service, this venue is awesome. IF you're just visiting, make plans for another place because it fails hard. Nobody enjoys leaving Vegas with a bad taste in your mouth. Get your mind out the gutter folks.",1,1,0

That being said, I expected this club to top all of the other clubs on the strip. There are so many good ones that I assumed anyone making a new club would make it extra spectacular in order to insure its success. I think I still prefer Marquee over this club. My reason for 4 stars instead of 3 is because although it is more than packed and guest list line does take about an hour, that is to be expected with Vegas clubs. It's not fair to ding them for something that is the standard. Luckily we were able to join a table on the balcony level of the main room to avoid being absolutely smushed. This made the night much better than it would have been. 

The inside really is beautiful and I enjoyed all of the different LEDs. It has a very classy and upscale vibe. They shoot out confetti which covers the interior and looks really cool and they do have good dancers. If you're going to buy drinks be prepared to fight the crowds at the bar area and to pay a lot. I know everyone has said this but I'll say it too: way too many stairs! For walking between levels there are elevators available though. 

Overall I would come back, for the newness and the lineup. But still not my ""fav"".",5,1,5

Do's...

- Buy pre-sale tickets (duh!)

- Get there around 10p or 11pm. Yes I know this may be early for some of you fashionably late peeps but if you want to wait in a long line then by all means do so. Getting there at 10 or so the wait is really quick. Go inside, get a drink and a spot and enjoy the music.

- Do pregame drinks (optional), the drinks inside are very expensive but then again so are lots of clubs in Vegas. Just don't be drunk in line. 




Don'ts

- Buy table service. Honestly, whatever floats your boat. You can spend lots of moola on a table and yea you have a table and your own space, but guess what? When the main event starts the place will be super packed and your space will shrink. Why? Because you will have lots of drunk dancing retards invading your space like World war Z or something.. like that.. yep even the bouncer that you had in the beginning can't help you. They will come...


The only gripe I would say I had was the bouncers at the line checking your i.d. for starters.  Does it take 2 bouncers to check your i.d.? First guy looking at my i.d. stared at it for a good 30-45 seconds. Tilting it, yep there are holograms, staring at it more... and more... Probably checking my DOB? Why are you staring so long? Are you subtracting the year? Lets see... this year is.. oh yeah 2013 so i subtract from this DOB year.... hmm.. oh yes you are over 21! Then he passes my i.d. to the next bouncer to check. Really? Are we going to Fort Knox?

A bit skeptical about visiting this behemoth of a club and NGL didn't hear the best things about it but I've partied at some of the major clubs across the nation and had to check it out at least once.
CLUB reviews consist of 5 stars for each of the following:

LINE:
**some creepy single asian cat was the first to get there, he had his ticket and was SOLO DOLO the entire time. I later saw him inside the club CREEPPIN' .. not even talking to females just.... staring.

creeped me out so much that I honestly covered my drink everytime I walked past him in fear of being drugged and taken advantage of later on that evening.

Before we got in the bouncers were arguing with each other outside about which line to let in first and they didn't know WTF was going on\/happening. Unprofessional to say the least but we got in rather quickly and they didn't check several peoples tickets\/ID, etc. not like I care, we're all well over the legal drinking age. -1.

DJ:
Tiesto was like $100 on Saturday. I've seen that foreign GOON spin a hundred times and he's got mad skills on the 1's and 2's don't get me wrong.. but $100 to see him again? #NTY.
Tommy Trash on a Thursday, why not? 

Mr. Trash ear-fu*ked all of us harder than 14-year olds getting ready to lose their V-card. This cat THREW DOWN. Mash-ups of In My Mind, Reload, Tommy Trash is a certified GOON in my book. Props sir, I left absolutely... TRASHED!! +1.

DRINKS:
What do you expect? Normal Vegas prices. I bought a bottle of Fiji water, it was the smallest bottle that the brand makes and it was also the most expensive. $9 for what seemed like 8-9ounces of free liquid. -1.

GIRLS:
Honestly, Hakkasan is so massive, such a mega-club that it attracts so many foreigners. Foreigners in a TERRIBLE way, not a good way. Broads with messed up teeth, smelled like they showered twice a week (because thats the norm where the're from), broads with body hair, and accents thicker than bulletproof glass. -1

DECOR:
I must applaud the decor. The mega structure hovering overhead is a dazzling display of LED lights, fog machines, confetti streamers, and a huge light wall. The brilliantly choreographed visual displays inside this club are truly one of a kind. +1.

I don' think i'll be back. Too big, too much. Too overpriced, too many lines. Not enough normal females, or bathrooms.

He then grabs another guy to check the ID and he also says, ""that is not her."" 

THAT IS SUCH BULLSHIT. I've been coming to Vegas for 3 years along with my friend who got checked and have gotten into XS, Marquee, TAO, EBC etc. with NO QUESTION whatsoever. The ID picture looks exactly like my friend, just younger, because it's her HIGH SCHOOL picture. He then tells her that she's not coming in tonight. She pulls out her Chase Sapphire Credit Card, but he doesn't even want to look at it. WTF. Then he looks at me, ""are you coming in, or are you going to leave with her?"" WOW. 

First of all, we had a 2nd form of identification on her and he didn't even want to look at it. 

Second of all, it is really shady how he didn't even confiscate the ID if he thought it was fake. Isn't that the rule? Freaking ridiculous.

The dance floor is probably a good 60x40... CROWDED. The bar and walkways were empty around 10:30PM-11:15PM-ish. 

A couple hours later, heard Lil' Jon was going to be the headliner, got a heineken & vodka cran for $35 (I suggest you pre-game) finally after a long wait at the bar, and next thing you know, this place is over-capacity. It was getting so ridiculously crowded, hot, and crazy, after seeing Lil' Jon come out for a few minutes, and the galore of balloons and confetti coming down from the ceiling, we had to call it quits. Overall, a good experience. The music was REALLY good in the first couple hours (hyphy, 90's-2000's hip hop, r&b remix), then the trap\/trance started. Strobe lights, fogs, etc at an extreme pace. If that's you're thing, by all means. Just don't expect to hear the same kind of music throughout the night.",1,1,0

I'm a fan. First time in Vegas, got the hook up via a friend for Steve Aoki. The venue is amazing in appearance, and I like the fact that it had multiple floors (granted that most clubs in Boston is one floor and not as large). However, because Mr.Aoki and probably every other notable DJ that graces their presence at these venues take their time to get on stage, we ventured to the Ling Ling Lounge (LOL like wtf kinda name is that for a lounge). I think L^3 was the highlight for us - it played mostly top40\/hip hop, which is what me and my friends preferred. 

Around 1:30am-2ish, we ventured back up to the main floor and we lucked out so hard. Right as we past a certain point on the path to the main dance floor, the bouncer behind us blocked entry for everyone behind us. #blessed I think I'd be hella angry if I had paid x amount of money to a club and couldn't even get access to the general dance floor. Steve Aoki was cool, the effects were dope, the robot dudes blowing cold air into the audience was kind of pointless but whatever.

A couple of things I'd advise:
-Pregame hard - drinks are small, but expensive, and fighting through the crowd to get a drink isIa journey
-If you're bringing a jacket, expect to check it in. I was kind of pissed about this because I saw dudes walking in with a light jacket and I got called out by a bouncer to check my jacket in. Like bro, this jacket is a part of my swagger and you're forcing me to turn down the swag
-Come early! Forget people saying that it's uncool to arrive to the club early. Sure, you're uncool, but you're also unstupid, aka you smart. For a first timer, I think we would have been at the very back of the hotel waiting in line if we had not gone at around 10:30pm. 
-Ask around in your network for a promoter in Vegas. Going through a promoter offers the possibility of discounted cover, free cover, etc.

TL;DR: It's chill.",5,4,2

2Guys, 12 beautiful London girls walk up to Hakassan inside the MGM Grand.

1: Complicated rope system and less then personable body guards make it a formal and dry introduction. Guest service line is inconveniently placed around a different bar in the MGM casino with no sight lines. Not the biggest deal.

2. Very high pressure to get you in quick, split our party and made it an extra 20 mins while we waited to regroup. Good luck asking them to hold the elevator while they triple check ids.

3. Once inside literally had to shout at a whispers distance and still couldn't get a clear sentence out. Table service was granted to the girls for #1 (yes I know I have good taste) while me and the partner were told 1500 or we could visit the bar. Not allowed to sit with the girls we brought not comped, basically a sorry apology and the owners are coming through so ""It is what it is"" so why can't we sit with the party again?

4. Took some action to join another table because we wanted to treat our 2nd group of 6. Almost got a great deal by just asking fellow table holders however they were removed because they were ""out bid"". Now removed from two tables with a strained relationship of 18 girls because this club doesn't know what it's doing.

5. Re-entry was nice and easy and confetti plus light show was impressive. Bottle service and guest service team can and will make it an expensive time and did not earn my service or my return.

Tip: I'd rather revisit Omnia or spend that $300.00 with Vic at Dream Cars Las Vegas. Very poor business, poor hospitality and overall an expensive headache that could last longer than the table you buy.",2,0,0

I wanted to go to here since I've heard ""rave"" reviews from friends. I wanted to go to see Hardwell so knowing it would be crowded, I bought tickets ahead of time. Unlike other reviewers who waited hours to get in, there was no line and I got in immediately. 

The club was so overcrowded, it's hard to move around and it's hard to breathe because there was way too many people. The clubgoers are ratchet and rude. I was trying to have a good time and dance but people kept pushing and shoving without apologizing. I was so fed up that when one girl pushed me out of her way, I shoved her back. Mind you, I'm a person of color (Asian) and she and her group were white. She and her group of friends were mad at me and kept glaring at me and giving me dirty looks. They felt so entitled that they even told security hahah seriously? You're the one who rudely pushed me so don't blame it on the Asian. Even a group of black women saw what happened and even asked me if I was okay.

As for Hardwell, I never even saw him because I was so pissed off with my club experience and I couldn't deal with the crowd. I left early and it wasn't worth it. Go to XS if you want to have an actual good time, not this trash excuse of a nightclub.",4,3,2

It's funny that promoters were so friendly to reach out to you, perhaps couple times after you asked the same promoter to get you on the guestlist, this promoter won't bother to tell you the time to meet up (or say line up) at the club. Alright, I'm spoiled, I'm used to meet up with promoters and they would lead us in. Hakkasan? Get ready for lines. 

As for my most recent experience (headliner: Dada Life on 2\/27). I texted my promoter around 9pm and asked when should we get to the club, he answered ""Guestlist closed at 12am, you've got plenty of time."" So I was naive and I forgot when I was here last September, I got to the entrance an hour before the guestlist closed, turned out there was a line and it would take 45min at least to get it. I was naive and I totally forgot about this, and we got there before the guestlist closed. It turned out everyone lining up on the guestlist eventually would get into the club -- a solid 1-hr wait in the wind, how lovely. Oh yeah, the line was too long so everyone got to line up out side of MGM. Didn't see that coming so that's why I said I was naive and forgot about the crazy lining in Hakkasan. 

We got into the club, and they asked us to walk stairs. What a nice cardio workout before my planned-dance workout, right? Oh probably I should take this as my leg day since I was wearing heels and walking 4 floors of stairs. Seriously, why wouldn't Hakkasan turn into a gym? Hakkasan Gym? Or, Stairasan Gym? I'm not sure which one sounds better.

I was thirsty so I decided to get water: $9. My friends were teasing me that I should've gotten a cocktail instead. I mean... I've never got charged for water in clubs. Now I feel bad for guys because apparently they were paying more than us girls.

Hakkasan has a great sounding system, the laser effect is very cool and it's people everywhere. As usual, we went down to Ling Ling Room and for the first time ever, I found a dance floor *in shock*. Ling Ling room is basically like a small maze, it's small and easy but easily to get frustrated on the way out. As for the main floor (where headliners perform), there was no way to get in, people were sticking onto the tables side and tried to get to see the DJs. There were no place to rest and lots and lots of stairs...Table-side securities were strict and sometimes rude. Some staff were friendly but that was really rare.

I've been here and saw Tiesto, Martin Garrix, Hardwell and others. It's great that Hakkasan can get so many big-name DJs but frankly speaking, they performed better in larger festivals. The Ling Ling Room DJ was pretty sick and did crazy good transition between different genre of music. Overall, Hakkasan is a upscale club as they claimed to be, it is a super fancy club but it's small due to the weird interior flow design (stairs and hallways). I feel 4 times is enough and I'm sure Hakkasan will still make hell of money from the EDM-lovers and sure don't mind me leaving. Hakkasan, I tried, but I just can't like you.

The dance floor was pack as hell, the security kept telling people to move and stop blocking certain area.. uhm where do you want people to go ?? Floors are pack. The whole place is pretty much bottle service table but no one was in them. The upstairs was empty but you don't get a view of the bottom since they're all reserve for bottle service.

We came on a Friday night and were very happy to be here after a disappointing trip to Light.  I enjoyed our time in Hakkasan because we had bottle service for 17 girls on the main floor not too far from the dance floor.  Our bottle service area was spacious and not shoved up against another table.  There was a low platform in our area for extra seating and dancing. Our hostess was really nice, even when one of our girls accidentally knocked over our bucket of ice, we made sure to tip them extra for cleaning up our mess!

I especially enjoyed the hip hop room downstairs!   The hip hop rooms in Vegas have always been smaller than the main rooms and Hakkasan is no exception.  The room itself is big but the majority of it is for bottle service tables only.  The dance floor is really small but they do have platforms throughout the room to dance on top which is where some of us were for a good portion of the night, mainly to get away from the super packed dance floor and still enjoy the music.  However my girls and I did get lost in here as I think there's only one way in and one way out, and when you're drunk it's easy to get lost inside!

However, I had seen the crowds and the lines when walking through the MGM, and that didn't get me very pumped.  I had also been hesitant to go to Hakkasan because several of my Yelp friends had reported phone and wallet thefts there with little care given by the management.  I know these Yelpers to be some of the most honest reviewers, including a couple of Yelp Community Managers, so I was wary.  Those reviews, along with the fact that my friend had a similar thing happen at another Vegas club with me, kept me from wanting to check out Hakkasan.  It has been over a year since those reviews were written, and the group I was with wanted to go.  We had a connection with a promoter who was able to get us in on two of the three nights we were staying in Vegas, so I decided I wanted to go too and see what all the fuss was about.  I'm glad that I did go, because I had a great time on both nights.

Night 1 (Friday):
The line was long, and was not moving at all.  Somewhere close to 10:30PM it started to move, and it moved quickly.  Once we got in, we were greeted by what seemed to be an endless number of stairs.  There were several floors to the club, and with each floor came different layouts.  There was hip-hop on one floor and EDM on the main floor, which also had a couple of adjoining areas. The sound system and the music was good.  It was not as over the top looking as I would have expected inside, but the lights were very cool. It was a great atmosphere, with the worst thing being that the drinks were way over priced.  

Night 2 (Sunday):
Getting in was far more chaotic because there didn't seem to be a line.  We were waiting in a different area than Friday, possibly because we had informed our promoter that we wanted a table and bottle service.  We were in a crowd of people standing around until our group was let in at around 11PM.  We were then led up to our table that was off in a random corner.  It was actually nice to have our table out of the way of all of the crowds, but it also felt like we weren't fully experiencing the club. Our group took turns walking around to dance and see what was going on in the different areas.  There seemed to be different floors open than on Friday, or rooms that we had missed.  There was a loungy area playing hip-hop, that we did not see on Friday.  It was not as good as the floor that was open on Friday because it felt too congested with a tiny dance floor.  The EDM room was opened and packed.  As for the bottle service, the staff kept all of our mixers and ice fresh.  They were super friendly and attentive.  It was worth it to get bottle service because we seemed to spend less on drinks than going to the bar, and we had a table to sit at when we got tired.  Although Sunday night was great, I preferred Friday because the music was just a tad bit better.

Hakkasan was very polarizing it what it had to offer.  There were things that were great about it, and things that dampened the experience. I do think the good far outweighed the bad, and I would some up the plusses and misses as:

+ Atmosphere, music, and service

- Entrance line, stairs, and expensive drinks",13,7,7

I had never really been to a large club because there weren't any where I lived before so I wasn't sure what to expect. My friend being from a big city had been clubbing plenty of times. This place shocked both of us. Having been to Drais the night before which was pretty chill this place was a bit of a culture shock but we'll get to that. 

We bought tickets for GTA so we got in very quickly & all of the people working the lines were very professional & nice. When you walk in you have to climb a bunch of stairs which sucks for women who are wearing high heels (aka me always). THIS CLUB IS HUGE. They've got an upstairs overlooking the entire club (didn't go up there so idk whats really up there but it looked spacious). The main floor area & another side area. Tons of funky, costumed dancers. We saw some horned devil looking girl, unique for sure. 

The club was so packed it was a little scary & overwhelming. We went into the main dance floor area in front of the DJs & you can't really dance. You're more likely going to bop up & down or fist pump. Also there are tons of empty glasses on the floor which is really annoying & dangerous. Wearing heels & having to worry about spraining an ankle is not great. Very claustrophobic & very grope-y in there. I can only imagine it's quite the fire hazard. Also the crowd is lacking in diversity & very young.. just turned 21 crowd. (not saying that's good or bad, it is what it is lol). 

It's not my scene but I enjoyed the experience & we had a fun night. GTA was a good time. I'd come back & do VIP maybe if a DJ I liked was playing but not with a general admission experience. If you've never been to a big club this would be a good place to try that out & it's a very Vegas-y experience. If you're in your early 20's this might be for you.",1,0,0

Even though I may have had an awesome experience one night, it may be completely different for someone else.  Different DJ, different crowd, different group of friends, different season, maybe someone got too drunk, etc etc etc.  So I definitely understand the mixed reviews.


But subjectively, I've been here twice, and had a blast both times, so 5 stars from me.  :D 

COVER:
Both times, my whole group has gotten in for free, despite always having a bunch of guys in our group (around 2 guys to 1 girl ratio) and arriving super late.  So no complaints in that department.  Another one of my friends (separate group from me) told me their whole group had to pay $80 though, so I could see how that could be a bummer.  

I think we got lucky though because we were told by our promoter that there was a cover fee both times (~$50), but then the bouncer just let us through for free both times... So they are definitely not super strict!  And it's always nice when you expect to pay, and end up not having to.  :)

All the bouncers\/bartenders were also nice!  Maybe not overly friendly, but definitely easygoing and not rude.

DJs:
First time was to see TIESTO, which was awesome.  They hand out these light up bracelet things and everyones bracelets dance in sync in the whole club!  Amazing.  Second time was to see AFROJACK, who's set was also amazing!  I also loved how they projected the lyrics above the DJ stage, which made singing along easy!  :D

SPACE\/TABLES:
Yes, some of the rooms are crowded.  The main dance floor is ALWAYS crowded, and I definitely hate that.  But both times, I was able to find a friendly table who let us join and dance\/sit there with my friends.  There's also a ton of space on the balcony overlooking the main dance floor, with tables.. and none of the bouncers shooed us away even though we didn't have bottle service.

DRINKS:
Drinks were expensive, and they force you to buy expensive tiny bottles of water.  So if I were a guy, I would hate that.  But Vegas is a little easier on girls, since there are free drinks aplenty.  

VENUE:
Definitely wear comfortable shoes!  Because this place is huge, and there's lots of walking\/stairs.  There's also an elevator though, which I was able to get on most every time.",2,0,0

I admit I did not know who Tiesto was, not being of the club scene, but I was told he was quite famous.  So we ordered our tickets on-line to pay the discounted $50 cover. Yes. That's discounted.  It would also allow us to get to the front of the line.

So we get there around 11:00 p.m. and trying to find the Will-Call line took us and a few other couples a few minutes to find.  Clearly marked signs would have helped.  We come upon this young lady carrying a clipboard, who apparently was hating life, if I judged her facial expression correctly.  Cold and bitter cannot even begin to describe her look. She asks for our names and we give her my friends name who bought the ticket. 

Her:  ""There's only one name on this purchase.""
Us:  ""Yes, but there are 2 tickets purchased""
Her:  ""But only one name""
Us:  ""When we bought the tickets it didn't allow us to enter the guests names""
Her:  ""Let me look at your email confirmation""
Us:  ""Here"" - we show her the screen on our phone
Her:  Flips through the pages on her clipboard
Her:  Looks at us - as if she'll see our names printed on our forehead I guess
Her:  ""Fine.  Just go.""

The warmth of her words made me feel sooooo giddy. 

And that wasn't the only bad encounter we had with Hakkasan staff.  The elevator attendants, and those silly guys walking around with the flashlights.  You're all rude. One of those guys actually pushed me to the side when I didn't move fast enough out of his way.  With the exception of the African American security guy on the 1st floor, and the African American elevator attendant (1st elevator).  Those two smiled and joked with us.  The others literally were rude and condescending.  

If that wasn't bad, it was apparent this place was seriously over packed. You could not walk without getting pushed and shoved and stepped on.  I felt like a little puppy in the middle of the pacific ocean!  We got to the 5th floor where it was less crowded.  

I will say that Tiesto was good...as much as I can say about DJ's.  Honestly, though.  I don't know how anyone can enjoy themselves unless they purchase those extremely expensive bottle service.  No chairs.  No view because the VIP sections take up all the balcony...the lights were interesting to watch though.

Coming back?  No. Way.

Note to Hakkasan Management:  We were there August 9th.  You may wish to discuss with that young lady, her lack of professionalism and non-existent customer service skills.",12,1,1

This new club has quite the line up of DJ's, and the weekend we were there Tiesto was spinning on Sat night! Being that he is among the top DJ's on the planet, we figured it would be packed so, of course, I turn to my fellow Yelpsters for advice...
Let me confirm and clear up a few things now that I have been there. 
First the nerve-wrecking stairs, this is a 5 story spot, but the club is only 3 stories. You enter on the main floor, so if you are there for EDM, stay there and no stairs. The main floor is the middle, so if you are there for hip-hop go downstairs, and now I can see a problem.
Second the non-VIP seating policy, there actually are places to sit for non-VIP. If you go downstairs, damn stairs!, you have two directions at the bottom, straight in the main room or do a 180 and walk down the hall. The back room is open seating, at least until the promoters sell the seat as VIP, but to us it seamed like we had a place to sit all night. Plus those bartenders are way less busy and hoooook it up!
Third the nice staff, this one is true! These were without a doubt the nicest bouncers and bartenders we had ever dealt with, and we have been to clubs from SF to Ibiza. It was a much better feel than the normal steroid-staredown that you get from most clubs in Vegas. 
Fourth the dress code, this is normal for Vegas, smart casual. A previous post mentions flip-flops, I did not see any, but let's face it a dress code is 99.9% for the guys so maybe she did sneak in with them on...
Fifth the music in the hip hop room, the posts about the gangster rap are probably from people that did not stay down there long enough, we really felt there was a good mix of many genres of hip hop, but we were there for Tiesto!
Last the dance floor, prior posts are accurate, there is little to no dance floor for a club that holds 5000 people. The main dance floors get so packed that it becomes more of a collective fist pump rather than dancing. We found that upstairs was the better place to dance. There is an open area up there, and while not technically a dance floor, we sure turned it into one! Oh and you can see the DJ booth from up there, if you look through the VIP's lining the rail. 
The lack of dance floor space is the reason I knocked a star off. All in all this is a great club, and with DJ's like Tiesto how can you go wrong.",2,0,0

I could see this place being amazing if I was still in my early twenties but there's only so much house music a person can take before it gets repetitive. 

That said Hakk is a great venue, lose a star due to the smallish dance floor in the main room (this is definitely a vegas thing). Tables and private booths are fun but chasing off bottle vultures can be a chore sometimes. Biggest Protip? Cash tip or grease your security guard and hostess BEFORE they come out with your bottle from prompt and attentive service.

While it didn't have as many stairs as Marquee, there were still quite a few. Granted, there were a bunch of rooms playing any type of music you wanted and I guess you can't be taking the elevator all day with those many people.

Suffice to say, it's layout isn't as good as XS which has that gigantic open area with no stairs. On the flipside, XS can get packed enough where you have to wade through the pool just to get out.

Both a downside and upside of Hakkasan is they don't close off the main dancefloor. Marquee and XS will have security shooing you away. Hakkasan did not the day I went. However, while you can make your way to the floor, you're packed like sardines.

That said, unless someone you love is playing here, stay away.

1) Getting in. What a pain! They require you to check your coat and charge $5 per coat\/item. I'm not a cheapskate but this feels like a total scam. Then, even if you are on a list they may not be able to find you because they have about 4 lists with different security guards that don't match and if they don't see you on the list they are rude. I think I would have bailed at that point if I had to pay a cover and even the cover line was backing up a lot.

2) Drinks. Why on earth are they charging $16 for a GIN & TONIC??? Or even a RUM & COKE??? I don't even want to know what they were charging for specialty drinks.

3) Music, eh. I only recognized 1 song the whole time but again take that with a grain of salt, I'm not a big clubber and well, dubstep... it's hard to tell when 1 song ends and a new one begins.

4) Atmosphere. Absolutely gorgeous! The architecture is beautiful, very open with an Asian Fusion feel. 

5) Extras, they seemed to have some interesting extras including a giant sparkler at the VIP booths, but really, unless you hit the jackpot, it seemed a bit over the top.

They are so lucky the promoters are grabbing the best DJ's in the world to play here or else no one would even think to come here again!

How much does this place suck? Let me list the ways:

1) Too many stairs. Stairs to get into the club. Stairs to get to the bar. Stairs to get into the other room. Stairs to the bathroom. Are you serious? Make your club on a ground floor with minimal to no stairs. I got the wind knocked right out of me trying to get into the main room. It's just a bad way to start the beginning of your evening breaking a sweat trying to get into a club.

2) Bottlenecked hallways and pathways. Can someone say fire hazard? I love clubs and understand that packed areas are part of the normal protocol. But Hakkasan will test your level of patience with how cramped it gets going from one area to another. And it's not even because of the club not being able to accommodate the crowd they are letting in. It's just a bad lay out and design of their hallways and how people need to get where they want to be.

3) The Dance Floor or lack thereof. This club is huge and you're designating about 1\/20th of the venue to the dance floor. It just makes no sense! Especially when you have the hottest dj's in the world playing, everybody wants to be on the dance floor. Well too bad, there's too many people here and too little dance floor to accommodate everyone. So why don't you just stay cramped in a hallway or stairway somewhere cause that's what there is a lot of.

4) You can't see the DJ. For whatever reason, it is impossible to see the DJ here. Once again poor design and layout of the club. The designers just did not take this into consideration when building the venue. Being able to see the DJ is an important part of the experience. Trying to get a view of the DJ is just something a person should not have to worry about. Totally kills the mood.

5) Poor design aesthetics and feel. Upside down parasol umbrellas are hanging from the ceiling, blocking off lighting from the light system that should be hitting the dance floor. They just had no common sense at all installing that fixture. Bartenders and bus boys wearing ninja suits, servers wearing shanghai dresses? It's just tacky and borderline racist.

Calvin Harris, Dada Life, Nervo, and Hardwell are some of my favorite Dj's and I will be waiting for their residencies to end than rather come back to this club. Not even worth to check out for a first time. Seriously! Save your money and time and go to XS, Surrender, Light, or Marquee instead.",15,4,6

I'd been wanting to check out this club for ages, so when I finally got an opportunity to, I was really excited. Of course, you can't go a mile in Vegas without seeing advertisements for Hakkasan, their lineup of amazing DJs, and hearing about how huge and wonderful it is.

Unfortunately, huge doesn't always mean wonderful. (wait...that didn't come out quite right)... ANYWAY, we luckily got in right away, without waiting in the long madhouse of a line, but as soon as we got onto the overly packed elevator, I got nervous.  I know it is a nightclub, but there HAS to be a better way to control crowd flow!! The first floor we stopped on was the hip hop room\/floor.  The music was fantastic! However, that was the only fantastic thing happening, because the air conditioning was either not on, or severely malfunctioning.  It was like being in a musical steam room with hundreds of people sweating. Even the bartenders were complaining and sweating.  I seriously felt like my face was melting off.  Obviously, we couldn't stay there, no matter how good the music.

Next, we went up to the main area. The difference in temperature was quite noticeable as soon as we got to the stairs. It went from the equator to the Arctic- but it felt amazing! We climbed the stairs (which was scary- steep stairs + high heels + masses of drunk people= recipe for disaster), and went into the main area. I will say, the light show and effects were gorgeous, but we were crammed in like sardines. Worse than that, you could not move. We seriously had to shove to walk forward, let alone finding a spot to even stand without being pressed against hundreds of strangers.  I was about to have a panic attack.  We stayed for *maybe* 10 minutes, when we decided to just get out of there.  Leaving was a feat in and of itself too.  

Between the stairs, the elevators, the poor crowd flow, the narrow walkways, and the air conditioning issues, I HIGHLY doubt that I'm going to return to Hakkasan.  This wasn't even a holiday or fight weekend- I can only imagine how bad it gets at other times.  I'm sorry, I'm going to have to party elsewhere.",10,5,5

I was in Vegas and wanted to do a ""clubby"" thing because that is what you were supposed to while in Vegas, right? Wrong. We got tickets for Tiesto and came a little bit late because we were told that the main performer doesn't play until much later on in the night.  The venue itself was horribly laid out. There are several floors with two different stages apparently? I dunno. Hallways to nowhere, bar areas hidden behind walls, walkways to a ""main"" area that was stupidly overcrowded. I felt like a mouse in a science experiment. The only people that looked like they were halfway enjoying themselves were the suckers that had tables that were roped off because they had some space. 

Needless to say we left after 10 minutes and joined many other people who left the same venue as us. My biggest gripe was not that we had a terrible time, or that there was nowhere for us to stand other than crowd the narrow walkways as people kept overflowing the area. But, the fact that it was so overcrowded to the point where it was a legitimate safety concern! I am convinced that they either oversold the event, or let it way too many people\/or people without tickets. While trying to leave this maze of a club, we followed exit signs to dead ends (roped off areas), that if an emergency where to occur it would be catastrophic. This may sound dramatic, but I kept getting thoughts of the horrible The Station nightclub fire while trying to leave this death trap.

Look, I'm not salty about not being able to get a refund, or that I didn't get to go ""clubbing,"" I just felt cheated and wronged, moreso than I did losing my money at the blackjack table.

One of the places I wanted to take the Bride to Be was Hakkasan. She has never been there before and Above and Beyond was playing and We were super excited to go see them. We got in contact w\/a promoter who said he'll take care of everything including a comp table. We arrived there, got in and was placed pretty much on the back wall all the way to the right table behind the dj. It was amazing! He said he was getting us 2 bottles for free, we were ecstatic! There was another group table next to us with a bachelorette party as well :)

The place was great, love the light shows, overly crowded esp dance floor. 

So the reason for the 1 star. The promoter told me we are seated in a prime spot and he asked for gratuity. I was thinking sure, our cover entry fee was waived and we didn't mind paying gratuity for the bottle service girls and we were getting 2 bottles. The first bottle came out, we were dancing and having fun, and the promoter KURT BENZ came up to me again for gratuity. So the girls and I gave more than $200 and I said ""Gratuity for the girls"" and he replied by saying ""No, it's for me"" and he pocketed the money. My first thought was ""How odd"" I thought it would be for the bottle girls. So within 20mins we prob finished more than half of our first bottle and then was told someone bought the table so they scooted us out. I get it, no prob. He told me he would find my girls a new table, and to text him in a bit. We did and i text him back, he simply replied by saying no tables now, give me a sec and he would postpone the time to text him. Mind you, We don't mind mingling w\/other ppl at tables or partying next to guy\/girls, sharing is caring :). Looking around I noticed there were tables in the back not being occupied and would've been fine if it was not around the dance floor as long as We got to see Above and Beyond.. An hour later looked back at the table we were at and saw No one occupying that section. So i text back KURT asking luck on tables? He NEVER replied back that night.

We ended up going to Light which was way more fun. The promoters at Light takes care of you regardless if you have a table or not.. They want repeated customers. 

So next day, saw another Hakkasan promoter and he said he'll give me a comp table for my group, I told him what happened the night before with Hakkasan promoter KURT BENZ and he apologized on Hakkasans behalf... Within 3-4 hours I got a text from KURT saying he has a comp table for me . Ummm No thank you. He left a nasty taste of Hakkasan in our mouths.  

Hope things like this doesn't happen for other party goers of Hakkasan..

I cannot stress enough how horrible this club is. Please save yourself and go somewhere else if you want to have fun. I felt bad for the guys in our group because they actually paid to go in.

Mind you, this was a normal summer weekend so the crowds were larger than in other seasons, but there were also no big events like Boxing\/March Maddness to enlarge the crowd.

Pros 
- Got on tickets presale, were able to get into the club very quickly. Bouncers didn't give us any problems and you can scan the ticket on your phone.
- The sound was very loud with clean\/crisp bass
- Nice effects and visuals

Cons
- The layout of the club - just stairs and hallways all over, good luck finding your friends.
- Too many different areas in the club - didn't feel like one big club.
- The main dance floor was too small and got insanely crowded. I was on the dance floor for about two hours but ended up leaving 30 minutes into Tiesto because I just couldn't take it anymore. You're like a sardine in there smashing in-between a bunch of dudes and bumping into chicks who don't want to be bumped into. At 6'1 210 - I don't consider myself a small guy, but I was getting pushed around. I feel bad for girls in heels trying to enjoy themselves. I couldn't even get off the dance floor when I wanted to leave as they closed the main entrance\/exit - you had to go to the sides to get out which took forever. As you can see this was my biggest gripe about the club. 

Overall - I'm sure this club would be a lot better on a Thursday or Sunday night. I warned my friends that this might happen. Big name club and big name DJ doesn't always add up. If I could go back I would have gone to the Marquee and seen Dash Berlin. I would recommend going for a second tier DJ at a good club if you really want to have a good time.

There are so many other clubs that are more upscale, have better music and layout and more reasonable for drinks. All around, not so great.",4,1,0

So I cannot compare the Hakkasan to any other clubs. This review is solely based on my first time going to the Hakkasan.

My buddies and I went to the Nightclub to see The Chainsmokers on March 10th. We paid $35 for our tickets, but we bought them online a month in advance. Apparently cover at the door is $100 from what I've heard? We got there at 10:30 PM to get in line. Didn't take too long to get in, we were some of the first people there. It filled up quick though. 

Anyway, my friends and I all had an absolute blast. The place was packed, but what do you expect? Drinks were also expensive, but again did you expect anything else? I bought one Vodka & Redbull for $25. Service was quick and hassle-free. Thankfully I did enough pre-gaming beforehand to where I didn't need to spend another $25 on a drink lol. If you're not looking to spend that kind of money on a drink, I highly recommend pre-gaming. Common sense, but whatever just saying. The club itself was really nice. The lights were cool and the mist machine was on point. 

I most certainly wouldn't hesitate to go to another event on the Hakkasan as long as I purchased tickets in advance. No way I'd pay $100 at the door to get in. We had a great time. The concert was definitely the highlight of our 4 day trip.",0,0,0

 However there are many reasons why I would not want to come back to this club. I have been to many clubs in Las Vegas including Marque, XS, Tao, and lights. I have been to Vegas 10 times in the past 3 years so I know the pros and cons of clubs. 

First: The bouncers are not friendly. I try to start a conversation and I will be ignored and they are not polite at all. 

Second: The venue is really crowded with no standing room. If you do not have bottle service then this place is not for you.  

Third: Water is 8 dollars and you guys don't offer tap water? I just spent 100 dollars on drinks and I can't even get a glass of water?

It is still a nice and amazing looking club but it would not be my first choice in Vegas.",1,0,1

1. i did not have to pay cover (yay for being a girl in vegas)
2. they have the best djs spinning (hardwell, calvin harris, tiesto..etc)

i came here during edc weekend on a thursday and Hardwell was spinning. it was only me and my other girlfriend meeting up with a group of people instead. but our plane landed a little late so we got to Hakkasan around 12am. We walk straight to the front, i told the man holding a list that it was only me and my girlfriend and he let us straight in.

This place is huge! I walked in and it reminded me a lot of TAO at the venetian. When hardwell came on, the dance floor became extremely packed, to the point where i could not breathe so we decided to leave the dance floor. I really wanted to see hardwell, so I went to the top floor and somehow shmoozed my way to a table which an amazing view of the floor.

The first time, I went with a group of girls on a Thursday. We arrived early with little to no line. There were free drink tickets for vodka drinks. I don't remember what DJ was there that night, no one spectacular.

We stayed out late and danced our butts off. We met new people and had a great time. 

Hakkasan always has the top DJs and is built beautifully. There are always awesome go go dancers and light shows up front. And the dance floor is big, but never big enough.

The second trip we made, we came only because Rose Rabbit Lie closed at 3 am, but we knew Hakkasan would still be open. We didn't get there until about 3:15\/3:30. They were hesitant to let us in, but because we were girls, they did. 

Obviously the DJ had left by then. I don't remember who it was but it was Saturday night so it was someone good. 

When we got to the dance floor there was cotton everywhere! What the hell?! A pillow fight happened I think! Crazy! Anyway, we ordered drink and proceeded to keep dancing until 4 am when they sent everyone away.

My disappointment with Hakkasan is not due to my clubbing experience, the layout, price, or drinks. Nope, I had an all-around amazing time at Hakkasan during my recent Vegas trip. The 1-star rating is due to being misled by one of the bottle service ""Marketing"" professionals who I will refer to as ""Z.""

Our group paid a total of about $150.00 for advance tickets to Hakkasan on Sunday, January 29. Upon arrival we met Z who tried to persuade us into buying upgraded bottle service. We were a small group but didn't mind paying the premium for a better experience. It was Chinese New Years and we all had some extra cash, it's Vegas so whynot? But since we had already paid the $150 we asked if that amount could go towards our table service bill (see text). Z said no, but suggested, definitively, that we could get a refund on the tickets. Based on that information we chose bottle service.

The following week I contacted Hakkasan customer service to ask for a refund. My request was denied even after showing the representative the text from Z. After some back and forth, the agent finally offered to provide me with comp tickets for my next visit but I insisted on the refund. The agent reminded me of their non-refundable policy and was adamant in not giving me a refund despite the evidence that I was intentionally misled....And because of how this story ended I am giving Hakkasan 1-star and will never patronize this business again.

I don't want to sound petty but I am writing my review based on principal. $150 was really just a drop in the bucket considering the fact that we spent about $2k that evening and we would have selected upgraded bottle service even if Z did not suggest the refund. This message is for Hakkasan management = we understand that Vegas nightlife is competitive but your agents should not resort to unethical and misleading practices to hit their quota.",31,0,3

If you're a woman standing on the dance floor with a purse, you're a target. There's some kind of crime ring happening that can ruin an entire Vegas trip if they get their hands on too many personal items. They appear to be pick pocketing cell phones and if they can wiggle a wallet out while they're at it, game on. A handful of girls in our group noticed their cell phones were missing about an hour into the night and once those of us that still had ours started flashing the ground to see if we could find them, ladies dancing around us jumped in announcing that their cell phones had been swiped, too.

Sadly Hakkasan's security guys couldn't do anything about it, because their job is to keep the fire lanes clear and keep bottle service VIPs away from the commoners. It's a shame because if they had just put a few more security guards on the dance floor after the many complaints we sent their way about the situation, some people could have been safe from the thievery.

Losing your phone or ID on a Vegas weekend is probably one of the worst scenarios you can think of because your whole life is put on hold and you have to jump through hoops (while on vacation) to get everything back in order.

Props to securing kick ass DJs and the unlimited confetti budget, but there's a serious issue taking place under Hakkasan's roof that needs to be addressed. And fast.",119,33,25

I know this is Vegas, not California, but the smoking inside the club was just not cool. There was more than one guy who came very close to burning me and my friend with their cigarettes because they were dancing and drunk and not paying attention. Another person left a lit cigarette on the stairs. If someone chose a terrible pair of shoes (which I'm sure never happens, right?) and took them off during the night they could get hurt. It's just unsafe. Okay, I'll turn my mom voice off now.

The headlining dj doesn't start until 1:30am. 

I lied, my mom voice is back on. There needs to be a water station somewhere. I know they want you to drink or pay for their expensive bottled water (ecologically irresponsible, Hakkasan!) But people will make plenty of their own bad decisions regarding what to drink. At least give them the option of being smart and re-hydrating at some point in the night.

You can take elevators from floor to floor but there's a lot of sets of 2-4 steps up or down seemingly randomly located all around the main room and it seems that some of the job's of the bouncers is just to shine flashlights on them so people see them.

Hakkasan is a lackluster combination of Tao and Marquee's Godawful stairs...except there are more stairs and passageways in this labyrinth of a club. If you've ever clubbed at the Grand in SF, then the you should be familiar with the circular lay out. It's almost the same (referring to the EDM side only) except with an extra floor or so. They do have plenty of bars spread around so that in itself gets a star. 

Speaking of that, after i bought a drink from the bar on the right corner, I turned my head to see a what seemed like a 200+ lb black guy swapping mad spit with a skinny little white guy and grabbing each others...ugh wtf!! Almost yacked in my drink...I want my money back for mental scarring! I'm jk but seriously no one should see that. Another weird incident happened shortly after, we went down to the hip hop room and I got randomly attacked by someone who looks and talks like Steve Smith from American Dad. He came at me mumbling God knows what and I had to push him away 2 times before he turned around and started chasing 2 girls that just happened to walk by. Seriously, what kind of people are coming here!? Wtf!

Besides that nothing else really stood out (except seeing the people next to us rolling balls which was hella funny), the Vegas night club vibe wasn't there, and it just seemed like an expensive rendition of a Chinese karaoke spot with famous EDM artists playing in the center of the room. Dance floor is tiny so forget trying to get close to the ""stage"". 
Maybe I'm being harsh (it's only been open for 2 weeks) but XS, Marquee, and Surrender is still better IMHO. I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon or if ever.",6,18,5

Anyways, as I was getting my ID checked by this one bouncer, and mind you I am an Asian female with a baby face (but isn't that quite common??), he kept on insisting the ID wasn't mine and I am not 23 years old, and I'm probably 14 using my older sister's ID. I know I look young, but 14?!?! Ouch..... I even told him I've never used anyones ID but mine, and he rudely said BULLSH*T! He then proceeded to ask me to sign my name which I did three times. And he would ask other bouncers for their opinions which all of them (in the beginning) said no they don't buy it. SERIOUSLY?!?! All I had with me was my ID, my credit card (which I showed them too), and my phone.. did they think a girl will bring their passport, their Social Security Card, their birth certificate and bank statements to a club ?!?!

So since my ID and credit card wasn't enough, I then offered to show them ANYTHING on my phone, like logging into my bank accounts from my apps on my iPhone (and I specifically said THREE accounts), I can show them the email confirmation of the tickets for Hardwell, heck, I even offered to show them all my emails which shows my name and address! I can even log into my utility bills on my phone. And I even offered if I went back to my hotel room and came back with my school ID will that work. I was offering them EVERYTHING! But no, the bouncer said ""We don't go that far and deep lets do this the easy way,"" as he was walking me out.... He even asked me how old am I really after proceeding to kick me out, and I said 23, and he commented ""so you're going to stick with that are you?"" I replied with, ""yes, because that is how old I am."" And he laughed and said ""No you're not, you are 14. You may have fooled other people, but not me."" Yes, Mr. Bouncer, I feel a sense of pleasure and happiness to come see you and waste my precious vacation time to play mind games with you. I've never felt so degraded and disrespected EVER. Seriously.. I was willing to show them anything to prove it's me even going back for my school ID from my room but no one bouncer tried to help me. 

I then spoke to a security guard for MGM who FINALLY believe my ID is mine and help me talk to the bouncers and I believe the manager who was on duty (THANK YOU SO MUCH!). The manager in the beginning said he can't let me in and he would just return the money to me, and I just lost it there. They were willing to give me a refund, but I couldn't get in even though they already saw my Will Call email confirmation (which was logged into my email app by the way, not a screenshot or anything), and they already checked me off! In addition, a refund would've not be enough because I bought the tickets way in advance in January before it got so pricey. I told the manager I do not want a refund, I just want to simply get into the club and I was even willing to show him anything on my phone to prove it's me. He FINALLY said it's fine and let me in. 

This whole process took 20-25 minutes, I understand the precautions and people might be using other people's IDs, but seriously, I was willing to show them anything on my phone and even bring my physical school ID to prove it's me but they wouldn't even hear me out (except for the security guard for MGM). I don't think anyone will go that far into remembering someone else's password and usernames for EVERYTHING (utility bills and bank accounts), even logging into someone else's emails (4 emails), even making a fake school ID, just to get into the club. I didn't get any apology or anything when I was finally let in. 

Please tell me mister want-to-be FBI bouncer, how can a 14 year old be able to book a hotel on the strip on her own, have utility bills, and\/or ""get away"" with using someone's ID to get money from banks and fly on airlines but can't get into a overpacked and overrated club? Oh, how I dislike falling into the category of Asians with a babyface looking young.",10,7,3

So we were with a guy who tipped the bartender $100. I had been drinking a lot and I was really dehydrated so I asked the bartender for a cup of tap water. He said ""that will be $10"". I said, ""The guy we're with just tipped $100 can you please just give me a cup of water? He said, ""You didn't tip $100, that guy did.""
Okay first of all, it is illegal to refuse customers free drinking water when serving alcoholic beverages. Second of all, how awful of a person do you have to be to refuse someone water after being tipped $100? Thirdly, it is really irresponsible on Hakkasan's behalf to not be serving free tap water to customers. A place like Hakkasan probably has people carried out on stretchers all the time, and rather than do something about it, they are contributing to the problem. Keep in mind that this was in the summer, so a bar in the middle of the desert is refusing people water in 110 degree weather. How messed up is that? What if I didn't have $10? People in Nevada and Arizona die every year from dehydration due to the extreme climate. I could have dropped dead on the floor and it would have been entirely Hakkasan's fault. 
So yeah, if you enjoy waiting in line for an hour and paying $30 to get into a club where people are packed in like sardines and the staff treats you like shit, be my guest. I'm sure as hell not going to recommend it to anyone.",0,0,0

I had no problem getting in despite being with 3 other dudes and 0 females.  However, I made sure to respect their dress code...if you're a dude, you definitely want to go in with slacks (or khakis), long-sleaved collared shirt and most importantly, dress shoes.  Do not try to walk into this place with sneakers or athletic shoes, they simply won't let you in and I don't think they'll ""bend"" the rules.  Tiesto put on an EPIC performance and the music was just awesome.

There were plenty of very beautiful young women at Hakkasan on the Friday and Saturday nights when I went.  The ambience and décor of the nightclub is consistent with that of an upscale, exclusive nightclub on the Vegas strip.  This definitely is not a place for drunk, college students to go on a rampage and start humping the nearest doorknob.  All the stumbling, vomiting super-drunk folks will likely get escorted out of the club (forcibly by the bouncers) at the first signs of epic drunkenness (i'm guessing that's when the bile forms in their mouth before the vomiting).  

The music was great and it's a great setting to meet people if you happen to be single.  Although you'll be trying to talk over the music blaring from the center stage, that would likely be the case at any nightclub, especially the ones on the strip.  There are a few ""floors"" in the place and there's a lounge-type atmosphere at the tables.  Yes, navigating the stairs can be difficult if you're in a drunken stupor but it's really not a problem if you're sober.  The bathrooms are all on one floor I think.  The drinks are probably overpriced but that's to be expected because (i) this is Vegas and (ii) this is supposed to be one of the nicer nightclubs on the strip.  

I had a great time at Hakkasan and would gladly go back.  Me and my friends were all able to reserve pre-sale tickets which were way below the prices at the gate.  At the gate, I think dudes were charged $100 whereas my pre-sale tickets were $35 I think.  If you're a dude and you're not with 4--10 attractive young females,  you must (i) purchase the pre-sale tickets before they sell out and (ii) respect the dress code.",2,3,0

The only way to have any sort of fun here is if you have a bottle service table.  Seriously if they took out some of the tables and expanded the dance floor, this place would be 100 times better.

If you ever wanted to see a fire hazard then come here. It is so crowded even on a Sunday.  The layout is very similar to Marquee with the dance floor being surrounded by tables. Also they have stairs like Marquee.  Seriously, why do clubs have to include stairs because stairs and high heels is no good regardless if you are drunk or not.  You will feel like a tiny fish in a can of sardines in here unless you have a table. Your feet will get stepped on.  The bouncers will yell at you to move out of the way, except there is absolutely no room to move to.  Ladies wear heels you can last in because unless you have a table there is no where to rest your feet and you do not take off your heels in clubs ever.

Luckily we didn't have to pay any cover because I would have been super annoyed.  We saw Above & Beyond, which were really good as always.

Location: IDEAL. MGM Grand is central on The Strip and Across of Marquee. I heard a story about how the owner of Hakkasan was denied a table at Marquee, so he basically said ""you don't know what you've started"" and boom! Opened Hakkasan and took the DJ's\/Promoters\/etc. Not totally sure about this story...just heard it from one of the security guards.

Security: Since we're on that subject, the security was good! Lost your phone? Well, you should've gotten a better bag or maybe not even bring your phone at all. Think about it. If you were a thief who wanted to get a bunch of smart phones in one night without being caught, a nightclub like Hakkasan is like the gold mine!! Dark, smoke in your face when the bass drops, flashing strobe lights, drunk people jumping up and down not giving any f*cks.....yeah It's a thief's dream! So security is not to blame on your lack of keeping your things together. 

Atmosphere: Fancy & Posh. I think it looks like a spaceship. Stairs to the second floor are not the grandest, but hey...heals do that to you. 

Are your feet in pain from your shoes? Wear more comfortable ones. 

Price: It's all about the connections. I had a promoter who got my group (3 guys\/4 girls) in FOR FREE on a Thursday to see Dada Life. I got into the club and saw that some guys paid $40-50. Some girls paid $20 to get in. What do you expect from a Strip-central nightclub? Don't like the price? Go to some off-strip nightclub or come on a weekday. 

My opinion is to not set your expectations so high that you'll walk in and not enjoy your night. Keep your things together, have a great group of friends, be friendly to the security guard and workers (hey, this is their job almost every night!), and enjoy Vegas!! :)",6,0,1

This was not the case! The staff at Hakkasan are incredibly kind, and yes that goes for the ""security"" as well! The black security guy (sorry I didn't get his name) even shook my hand with a big smile and wished that I had a good time at the club! The security guys are all dressed well and were not condescending at all, and all of the hostesses doing table service were professional and good looking as well.

The hip hop floor was way too packed to dance properly, but the music was good. I guess this place is for EDM because the EDM floor is about three times as big as the hip hop floor and, well, it's obvious which room was more important to the owner.

Fergie DJ was the main attraction that night and he was great. The production was awesome as they had great lighting and great performers. Needless to say, I couldn't hear a thing when I left the club.

Fun night, definitely a good experience! One warning though, this is not a club to pick up girls. The hip hop floor is too crowded and I don't understand how you dance with a stranger to EDM. Had a fun night with my girlfriend, though!",0,0,0

This place was jam packed with a classy bunch of people.  We were able to get in by showing up early around 9ish.  The $125 cover for guys and $50 for girls was steep.   

Calvin Harris played a little bit at the show but it was mainly another DJ that looked like Calvin harris.  They lights and music levels were high quality.  Getting to the dance floor was way too crammed and it could take 15 min to move around in the club.  

The club was nice but way overpriced and overcrowded.  
The marquee is definitely better than hakkasan.  would not pay anywhere near that amount for the hakkassan again.  but you never know unless you play the game !",4,0,0

It's great that there's always a good headliner DJ playing every weekend in Vegas, thanks to their resident lineup, but the biggest problems here are the layout and the management.

The layout is like an up-and-down maze. The steps are always overcrowded with people, so watch your step or you'll be playing dominoes in human form. If you want to avoid the crowded dancefloor (and getting stepped on by high heels nonstop), it's good to escape upstairs, but there really isn't an area to dance. You do get a good view of the fancy lights and effects.

For all the negative reviews here:

1. Yes there may be a long ass line - buy tickets in advance or get in contact with a promoter before you get there.  I have no sympathy for freeloaders who complain about waiting.

2.  It's crowded as F*CK - is this honestly a surprise to you?!  If you hate crowds go somewhere no one likes, or spring for the table and have your own roped off section.

3.  I'm sorry you don't like house music? OK your review is irrelevant to me - have fun at 1OAK.

OK - on to the good stuff:

Hakkasan is B.E.A.UTIFUL!  The lights are amazing and I really love the hanging logos.  The layout is perfection, especially if you have a table.  There's no bad place to be in the club.  Yes it gets crowded, but the dance floor is so much bigger than places like Marquee or XS which is awesome.  

If you want to see the worlds' top DJ's while you're in Vegas, Hakkasan is the place to do it.  Seriously, follow Tiesto on Snapchat - he loves Hakkasan!  I think it's also Aoki's favorite place to cake his fans.  Hakkasan is like a personal playground to these guys.  My goal is to see Above & Beyond there before the year's end.

-Line moves fast
-Short wait time to get a drink
-Nice lighting

Cons:

-Dance area is overly crowded. People are always pushing and elbowing you while dancing.
-Main Dj (calvin harris) came on stage 1 1\/2 hours late, most of the night were opening djs playing.
-Staff had no idea when he has going on as I got different times when asking. 
-No outside area.

Not worth the money spent at all. Go to XS or Omnia if you want to see a popular Dj while having a great time.",0,0,0

First off, it was super easy to get into the club. The elevators were really accessible. When I'm wearing 5 inch heels, I want to be able to get from A to B as easily as possible. 

The second thing that blew me away was the incredible LED screens. I felt transported to EDC.  I also really loved the variety that Ling Ling offered. There was a totally different vibe between that club and the main room. It was nice to be able to transition between the two. 

The crowd was so amped and everyone seemed to be having a great time. Surprisingly, I didn't get fondled and groped by other club goers, which people in Vegas seem to think is totally acceptable to do to a group of girls. So, whoever is working the door there did a great job.

Sure Hakkasan has exclusive contracts with deadmau5, tiesto, and calvin harris but XS' 2013 residency lineup is nothing to scoff at: Porter Robinson, Knife Party, Avicii, Steve Angello, Eric Prydz, Afrojack, etc.   But an amazing club experience from a consumer's standpoint is more than just who comes on the decks at 1:30AM.  

There are a plethora of factors, both tangible and intangible, that these new clubs neglect that ultimately leads me to the conclusion that XS remains the best club in Las Vegas over Hakkasan and Marquee.  Here are a few reasons:

1) Hakkasan should be renamed Hakkastairs due to the massive amount of stairs that you cannot avoid and you MUST take to even get into the main dance floor.  This is also a major problem with Marquee's presale line as you HAVE to walk up like 10 flights of stairs to get to the main dance floor.  Have fun with that in your 5 inch heels ladies.

2) No outdoor patio area?!?!  Is this real life?  No pool? What is this 2006?

3) No gambling section?!?  No water fountain??  No I don't want to pay 9 dollars for your bottle of water.  And give me the option to play blackjack and lose $1000 but at least I get a couple free drinks.

4) With XS and Marquee, when you have a presale ticket, you never have to wait more than 10-15 minutes.   Hakkasan's presale line took approximately 1 hour. 

5) No re-entry stamps at Hakkasan....seriously?  But what if its just me and a couple of my guy friends and we get there at 9:00PM just to get stamps with the intention of coming back at a more reasonable Vegas club time at 11:30ish?  

6) Hakkasan was such a letdown that my friends and I left before the headliner even came on.  Hakkasan is like a nicer marquee (inside only as there is no outside to hakkasan).  To Hakkasan's credit, they have a very spacious dance floor and their production value of their lights and lazers is unmatched but a club experience is more than that and XS beats Hakkasan down badly when it comes to every other relevant factor

7) I've heard that Hakkasan charges 43% on top of your table minimum... Now I see how they are paying abnormally above market prices for deadmau5, tiesto, and calvin harris.  This is absurd.

Unfortunately the hype for Hakkasan was too big since it was supposed to be the XS killer but just like Marquee, they both fall very short of the top tier in which XS stands alone.

Now we get to see Light take its shot on Memorial Weekend.

TLDR; Hakkasan was overhyped and I was very underwhelmed.  XS remains the best nightclub hands down for a variety of factors.",40,16,10

Although they say ""upscale club wear"", I actually got in with a cute pair of sandals and I saw many girls with flats and sandals on. I did some research before and thought would be best to wear sandals. I even saw a girl with Nike SBs walk in :-\/. 
There are about 6 flights of stairs..but it is nothing to be afraid of. There are 2 bars on the EDM floor and the main one wasn't even bad to begin with.
I will say this..I have been to multiple raves and festivals and the amount of people in the club is A LOT. It's nothing I am not used to. But it is still a good time.

Basically, super early into the evening, we found a promotor that put us on the VIP list to get in, (It was my best friends Bachelorette party) and he said that if we get in line by 9:30. we should be in by 10:15, because they open their doors at 10:00.  We got into line at 9!  And we were not that far back into the already pretty hefty line. 10PM  around and they are literally letting in about 2 people at a time, the line would move maybe a group of 5 every 20 or so minutes.  Basically we thought we were now at the front of the line, at 11PM, but turns out we were in line for ANOTHER line.  So just to get in the club we would have been waiting until close to midnight to get in, and WE WERE IN THE FRONT.  Overtime we left the line, called bull shit on the bouncers and hung out at other places, coming back two hours later only to see that the line was completely stretched across the entire casino.  Still barely moving.  I call complete bull shit.  I refuse to go into this club at this point ever unless someone personally walks me to the entrance doors.  WASTE OF THREE HOURS IN VEGAS!

The layout of the club is perfect to see or be seen. The DJ overlooks the crowd and reserved sections. 

Bottle service is worth it as drinks are pretty pricey and the wait to get in under general admission is extremely long. 

Once you're in, it's tough to find a spot if you don't have a reserved section... It's hard enough to head to the restroom and back to your section as it gets crowded and sticky. 

The atmosphere is fun and the smell is fresh as air is pumped into here constantly but keep in mind there will be a few people who don't shower or have severe cases of body odor... But hey it's Vegas. 

When the nights over, leave the place quick as ish always goes down here... Cop surround the place and tend to hit up the drunk and belligerent people who can't even keep their balance. This is actually the most entertaining part of the night.

We ventured to Hakkasan this past weekend against all of the warnings we had been given by locals we know, friends who had visited, and from local bartenders, etc.  We were in and out in 30 minutes and that 30 minutes nearly ruined all of our buzzes for the entire night.

To begin with, we were on a guest list.  Yep, so was EVERYONE else.  The line for the guest list was about 20-25 minutes long.  It appeared that the general admission line was nearly empty.  Very odd set up.  Anyway...we finally get up to the front and with the guest list we were on the girls got in free and the guys paid $40 per person (4 guys...so $160).  

Once paid, you have to wait in another line for the elevator...or take the stairs.  Our group somehow got separated as me and my husBAND entered the elevator.  We went up and waited about 7 minutes for the others.  They came up out of breath and said they were told only the table service peeps could take the elevator and the others had to take the stairs.  Eh???  I just took the elevator and did not buy a table.  Whatevs.  We are all together now so started exploring.  

Exploring is one giant cluster of stairs.  Dark stairs!!!  Not just a couple of stairwells, it's like a freaking rat maze of stairs located all throughout each floor.  We finally made it to the top level where we thought we wanted to be and it was so dark and so loud that we were miserable.  Oh, we finally got drinks up on this level and 1 person bought a beer and 2 waters and his tab was $28.  Another person bought 2 drinks, 2 waters, and a beer and the tab was around $50.  We decided to locate the hip hop room located on the bottom level.  MORE FREAKING STAIRS!!!  We finally made it all the way to the bottom floor and the room was insanely packed and insanely hot!  We all looked at one another and didn't even say a word.  All started heading back toward the stairs.  15 minutes passed as we tried to exit.  Freaking ridiculous!!!

So, 25 minutes wasted in line, 30 minutes total wasted inside with about 20 of that climbing and descending stairs, and about $240 thrown away for an absolutely horrible time!!!  As we exited we noticed the entire guest list line we had waited in had been shut down...in the 30 minutes we were in there.  Eh?

Whatevs...we texted our guy at Hyde and headed over.  Hyde was AMAZING and totally made up for the crap start thanks to Hakkasan.

And lemme tell you that you might have to take a seat after hearing their quotes:

4 people for $7,500. Not including 40% tip and tax. 

You see that ----- FORTY PERCENT TIP AND TAX

So, basically $10,000. Can you believe that!? 10Gs.

And I believe this is a table upstairs. Imagine the ones on the floor.
And if you get a table in the lounge, you can't see the main floor. Ridic.


I know this is Vegas and you pay a ridiculous about for bottles that cost less than a hundred bucks. And pay for a place to sit. But, c'mon.

40% is completely ridiculous.",26,11,8

Followed him and his music from his early beginnings. However he wasn't even playing. He'd take his headphones off during a mix. And put them on backwards. I understand they pre record to time the lights for a better experience, but the mix and music was subpar. If it's premixed, there's no reason it shouldn't be brilliant. It was a top 40 radio station mix. I can listen to that on 105.9 Saturday night in the comfort of California.

 On the dance floor, I was constantly elbowed and pushed as people tried to push past me to get closer, although there was no where to go. They just decided they'd run over people. I'm 5'4 and big guys were pushing me over to get right in front because apparently they think they're better then anyone else and should be able to push and shove their way upfront. Pigs.  

Not only that this club is a fire hazard. I couldnt move anywhere, no one can. If there was a fire, youd never get out. I dont know how the fire marshall has okd this. Kids, save your money. You work to hard to pay 100 plus bucks just to wait in line and be treated like cattle for a dj who isn't playing to the crowd and subpar music.

The line was long but it moved unlike some other clubs.  Half of my party had to drop out of the line due to too much sun at the MGM pool.  We arrived in the club about midnight and it was already packed.  It was kind of hard to move around and the bars were about 2-3 people deep.   Beers are ten dollars each, holly cow, but thats about he price at most of the mega clubs.  

So why the 4 stars?  Once your in,  if you want to be in the crowd you can easily be there.  If you want to stand out of the way a bit, there are places for you, just explore the club a bit.  The dance floor, VIP areas and DJ booth are all controlled pretty well by the staff.  The best part of the club though is the energy and the music.  If you like EDM and high energy dance music this is the place.  If you keep up on the latest mixed and beats you are sure to hear lots of it here.  

My only recommendations would be to make the club larger and or have it open more nights of the week.

Yes, it's a hot spot in Vegas. Yes, Calvin Harris demands crowds, and you will be packed in like sardines. I get that. It's not my first time to a nightclub.

But when you have crazy drunk people that are so frustrated at the inability to move anywhere for anything, even if it's just to exit, it only makes sense that a fight will break out, which it did. Doesn't help that the security guy was yelling and pushing at a young lady which aggravated the guys she was with. Again, if you don't create the hazard to begin with, everyone might be fine.

Upon getting in, they have stone walls\/stairs kind of like a castle dungeon...

The first floor (Or i guess the second) is hip pop. I didn't go in, so I can't say much about it.

The next floor is the main stage and dance floor where the big name DJ's play. The dance floor definitely looks a lot bigger than at Marquee, but it's just as crowded. You're literally shoulder to shoulder (or less) and pushing your way through the walk ways, the dance floors, everything. The only up side is that they have decent AC, so I wasn't super sweaty the whole time. Oh, I also didn't bother wearing heels. I know, blasphemy!

The top floor is all tables. Don't bother coming up here unless you have a table. There is no space for you to really look down on the dance floor unless you're at a table. You can only look from afar. Might as well do that from downstairs.

Overall, I enjoyed my time here (I didn't even have any drinks! which I heard were $20 a pop...) mainly because Calvin Harris put on a good show. I'd come back again for the DJ's, not really because of the venue, which is not bad, but nothing innovative or special.",3,2,1

We went there with a group of just 3 girls (the guys went out separately for this evening). It's inside the MGM.. It's quite a walk from the entrance where we got dropped off by cab to the club... (my poor feet squished into adorable heels!)

Anyways, once we got there, there were like 4-5 different lines.. that went all over the damn place. But we finally located the guestlist line which we were signed up for. It looked like it was going to take forever.. But after standing in line for about 5-10 minutes, I made eye contact with this promoter who was circling around looking through the crowds and he came over to see if we were just girls. Thank god we WERE so we got lead out of the line straight to the club entrance. YAY

Once we got inside, it was amazing. The place is HUGE. Comparable to Marquee. We weren't feeling the house music right away and went to look for the Lounge.. It was like down a flight of stairs and some more walking around.. and we finally found it. The lounge was literally a LOUNGE. it was smaller than the upstairs portion but they had small seats and tables all over to lounge in. It was weird though because the music was good downstairs.. hiphop, etc. But no one was dancing?? Maybe we were still early?

However, please understand that if I was simply reviewing our bottle service experience, I would give Hakkasan 1-star.  

Let's first start with the main DJ being Tiesto.  His music isn't totally my style, but he was engaged in the crowd and the visual effects were awesome!  The sound system at Hakkasan is also something to note for electronic music lovers!  The line getting in wasn't anything because we were with a table.  Although the line to get in the elevator was a madhouse and all bouncers seemed confused.... 

Why our bottle service experience was ridiculously terrible: 
- Our server would literally push people out of her way without even attempting to ask them to move first.  There are pictures of her pushing one guest so roughly, that she nearly fell .. and she did spill her entire drink out of her hand (which came out of our shared bottles).  She also would walk in the middle of groups taking pictures to simply pickup a napkin on the booth top? 

- Our bouncer would not remove uninvited people from our table because he said ""nah, two of them work here and the other five are their friends, they get first dibs anywhere and since you're closest to Tiesto, they win"".  Is this serious?  

- Our busser (?? or male server's assistant??) turned up our final Goose bottle to finish the last swig of alcohol.  I brought this up to the table ""owner"" if you will and he said he did that to 3 out of 4 Goose bottles we ordered, but the final bottle easily had a full drink left.  Wow. 

And before the douchebags of Yelp think I am being petty about our table actually being OUR table... please note... I've partied with the hardest of them in this country and around the world.  I have never been treated like this at any other club in Vegas, NYC, Chicago, LA, Dubai, and beyond.  Additionally, the crew I was with is a group of very intelligent, kind, successful people. I've never heard so many uses of ""Please"" and ""Thank You"" at a nightclub than I did on this very night.  

As such.... Hakkasan, your servers are ugly inside and out.  You should learn what the definition of hospitality is because that is the industry you're in and apparently your service staff is trash who doesn't understand THE CUSTOMER PAYS THEIR BILLS.  The customer is your boss.  You serve the customer.  

Quite frankly, the server is lucky I wasn't paying the bill.  I would not have tipped her anything.  (And actually, the one bill we didn't tip her anything and she marched back, shook her head, said ""Uh Uh"", and handed him back the receipt for a tip. Again, a nice group of people that just gave in... but the tip was not deserved.)

And this is a Vegas nightclub?  HA. #wannabes",21,6,3

I came to Vegas on a whim opening weekend and had to check it out. It's super apparent that the people running it either run Marquee or are just jocking them. The elevators, lasers, light beacons they hand out, quirky ass dancers, and some of the decor is the exact same.

Why would you build a club with a couple steps all over the place so that you have to hire men to stand next to them with a flashlight and warn people constantly? I didn't stay long but I'm sureeee people were tripping all night.

We came here on a Thursday night knowing Hardwell would be spinning tracks, unfortunately, we were only able to get a table on the 3rd floor instead of the 5th floor (main floor were all the big name DJs play). Our hostesses were extremely friendly and the bussers bust their butts. Our cranberry, pineapple juice, sprite, and what not never went low or close to empty, they were re-filled quickly. The security was attentive, but chill and laid back as long as shit didn't happen.

Upstairs on the 5th floor it was hardcore! Don't expect to have too much standing room as it is mainly designed for bottle service! You're in Vegas and hot nightclubs like Hakkasan expects\/wants you to drop that dough $$! Unfortunately I didn't stay up there long since our table was downstairs and there were bottles waiting to be drank!

We eventually decided to leave our table and go upstairs and check out Hardwell, but unfortunately got kicked out because a friend of ours was a little too intoxicated, haha. I wasn't pissed because it is what it is and the bouncer was only doing his job.

Overall, love the service here, not sure if it's worth the $$ (even if I didn't pay, perks of being a girl!), but as long as the music is right I'll dance all night!",6,1,4

At least not as bad as how all the reviewers have been making it look like. But it seems like everyone is bitching about the general ""inexperience"" of the security staff above anything else. I got let in pretty quickly and even had a nerdy stocky lady bouncer give phone directions to my friends over my phone without attitude or trouble.

If you read my other reviews, you know it's very difficult for me to speak positively on stuff like this in general. So congratulations Hakkasan! You didn't piss me off! And you put a smile on my face!

Asians almost never smile!

However, we did have comped tables thanks to a friend that has close connections with the senior staff in this venue. So I am reviewing this place based on a pretty concise VIP treatment. 

Our host is fairly attentive and so is her busser. Never, once, have I ever needed to ask her to fill my drink when I was going dry. Which was a issue I had at 1-Oak where I had to fill my own glasses.

The best way I can describe Hakkasan is that it's just like Tao. It has a Asian theme, and has a restaurant downstairs. However, it is not as douchy as Tao. Now given, I seen a few catfights between girls jump off right in front of me in the hip hop room, and this being my first day, it does embarass and make the club look bad. But hey, at least I didn't get into a fight for the bathroom line like I did in Tao (read my Tao review), because there are more than FOUR bathrooms with NO LINES!

Another reviewer is complaining about the ""bitchiness"" of Asian girls in the club. Personally, I never had this problem because not only do I NOT talk to random Asian girls that are looking for their rich White Knight with a green card, but I have my own friend circle of hot Asians with me :p 

The key is building your hot friend networks OUTSIDE the party scene, because anyone who thinks that they can get laid on the first night of meeting a girl at a club will just catch a nasty case of herpes, and HIV if they are unfortunate (:

I enter the club with people I know, and leave the club with the same folks. And for anyone I met that night, ill hit them up the next day after giving them time to think about me (:

That's how you stay safe, and not missing any kidneys the next morning!",2,5,2

I've only been to Hakkasan for one night, and Drai's for one night so this is all I have to compare to. 

First of all, I want to thank Matt Roman for talking to us when we were walking down the street and hooking us up with VIP! He's the sweetest guy! Seriously, look him up if you wanna get VIP. 

Regardless of the VIP, the wait was SO LONG in line. After dancing all night the night before and planning on more dancing, it's not really fun to stand even more in heels. Definitely ended up holding my shoes in line after awhile. 

The venue is super nice! Walk in, and all you see is well-dressed ladies and gentlemen. 
However, the men were much more forward and pushy here compared not Drai's (not sure why). I actually had a situation with a random guy here who got a little too forceful and grabby, texted Matt about it, and got to us ASAP. Made sure I was okay and told us to let him or security know if it happened again and he'd get kicked out. He gave us a couple free drink passes each and I instantly started feeling better :) 

Security here is top-notch. My friend put her drink down next to her on some railing, and within minutes security came by to make sure it was hers and not an unattended drink. Nice! Keep the ladies safe :)

Can't say how much drinks were here with the free passes and being offered plenty of drinks from guys. (GO TO THE BAR WITH THEM, GIRLS)

Danced with lots of people, had a blast, but the music was a little too light? for me. Definitely could use some more hip hop. Every song was a little too happy and not heavy enough. Didn't recognize a lot of it. I believe Don Diablo was spinning that night. Could have used more lighting effects, etc.

Definitely felt super classy at this club and lots of eye candy for sure. Dress to impress. I'll be back to try it out again!",0,0,0

I'd rather spend my time watching c-span in the comfort of my PJs. It takes a special concoction to make a club a wonderful experience - DJ and dance talent, drinks, line control, special effects and more - all of which do not justify a $30+ cover. Furthermore, walking in and out of the club requires at least two sets of stairs, which is an absolute hazard to drunks and non-drunks alike.

Saw Calvin Harris here a few weekends ago and was lucky enough to get entrance for our group comped, so I'm keeping this review with that in mind. Seeing as how it had just opened, men's entry fee was $200. Yikes. 

Pros:
-The lighting and DJ visuals
-Tiesto has his own custom box he spins from. He's taking a break from Ibiza and will be playing at Hakkasan all summer.
-Killer lineup of DJs
-Drinks are good\/stiff and there's a few bars available. Not too packed.
-Bathrooms.

Cons:
-There's a lack of an apparent theme
-It's not that big, actually, especially compared to Marquee or Tryst (or maybe I just have a bad recollection).
-Other than the amazing DJs here, no wow factor to distinguish it from the other big name clubs

They oversell the shows so there is literally no room to walk around, let alone dance. Getting to the dance floor is a nightmare to say the least - and getting off (if they even let you) is even worse.

Sure, you can always ball out and get a table - and by all means go for it, just good luck getting to it. Stairs everywhere and just no where to stand and enjoy yourself.

When we got to MGM, it was about 11:30-ish, we went to see Calvin Harris (one of my friends is moderately obsessed with him. Can you blame her? Just LOOK at him!), and so we waited in line. The lines are confusing as hell, and make sure if you are there with a group, use the buddy system or you will lose them. The doors close at 12 for entry, so there was quite the crowd and there were dozens of people pushing\/shoving to try and get in as soon as possible. That being said, here's a list of things I reccomend you do before\/while visiting Hakkasan: 

1. WEAR. COMFORTABLE. SHOES. Ladies, the floors are insane here, and there is a ridiculous amount of stairs, and unless you reserve a VIP section, your feet will get tired. I recommend wearing wedges, or just bring a pair of those portable flats that you can easily carry in a wristlet. I made the mistake of wearing platform heels, I kicked them off within 10 minutes of being there because due to the stairs and ramps in the place, my feet were killing me. If you forget to bring those portable flats, no worries, the bathroom attendants sell them at about $10 a pop. 

2. If it's your first visit, make sure you get a map of the place, Or ask a Promoter (if you used one) to give you the low down on where the performers are going to be and where to find a specific section. Seriously. We were there for Calvin yet we spent most of the night on the first floor because we had no idea where anything was. By the time we got upstairs to see him, it was insanely crowded. 

3. Be prepared to spend a lot of money on drinks. It's $9 for a fiji water. I think someone said 12oz? I can't remember, but it was pretty small. Alcohol costs way more. I think I spent almost $20 on a Long Island? Then again, you are on the Strip and it is Vegas, so you were probably already expecting this.

4. Beware the Creepers. Because your confined to such a tight space, guys (or girls) will come up behind you and essentially try to grope you. I'm dead serious. Be wary of your surroundings. Security is pretty good here, but you can never be too careful. Unless you're into it. (What happens in Vegas....) Girls, worry not, Security is also pretty good about stepping in and making sure your personal space isn't violated, but again, be wary of your surroundings. 

5. It might get old fast. Even though it was my first visit, the ambience is alright but it gets old quick. I feel like the same songs were being repeated over and over again too, and you really don't have room to actually dance. It's basically a game of ""how much can I move before my toes get crushed again"". 

6. Sorry to say this, but there is a lot of discrimination here. There was an older man who was white and had half a VIP section, and he was complaining about one of the guys in our party who had also reserved part of that section. The guy in our party was Black. Security kept telling our guy to move down more, til the point where there was no room to sit. Essentially he was forcing him out of his section. The White guy went and said something into the Bouncer's ear and went back to his part of the section. The Bouncer then came over to us and told our friend ""you have too many people"". We had 6 people with us, and the section he reserved fit about 9, give or take a few. So our friend asks the Bouncer ""how many people can I have with me?"" and the Bouncer ignored him. Our friend got upset and tensions rose, and they ended up kicking him out because he was ""being disruptive"". I was extremely upset because he paid for that section, and when he was trying to comply with what the Bouncer was saying, the Bouncer ignored him. Absolutely disgusted me and essentially ruined the night. 


I think that's pretty much it. Overall, if you're with friends and determined to have a good time, you will. Hopefully if you reserve a VIP section, you will have a better experience than our friend did. Enjoy!",4,0,0

First downfall was the exit. When you are ready to leave, this place is actually pretty scary. I feel like there are only enough exit signs to be legally acceptable. It was very confusing and very cramped. I didn't drink, but I can't imagine being drunk and trying to navigate that. It was scary for me even! 
We got there early on one of the guest lists and the pre-DJ music really was not making it fun for us. We went right down in the middle of the club by the DJ booth and I was shorter than longer that we were crowded out. Another downfall, women are encouraged to just go up to guys who have bottle service just to get free drinks. I guess that makes it appealing to men to go there, but I just didn't really like that. 
Some cool things: there is confetti dropped multiple time throughout the evening. There was 'undercover' security everywhere! They did not look obvious but after people watching for a little bit, you could totally tell they were security. You do not need to pay to get in unless you are going there for a special DJ or something. On any old regular night, try to take a walk through MGM Grand or some of the other hotels owned by MGM and find a promoter! Give them your real name and phone number and details about the group of people you are with and they should get you on the guest list and help you out with plans for the rest of the night.

Of course females are cheaper lol. When walking up to the club, make sure you are in the right line. There is a line for reserved seating on one side and a line for prepaid tickets on the other side. It's actually quite confusing because people just bunch up in one area. Ask a personal there to help you get in the right line. After going through the line they check the guys for weapons and etc. Inside Hakkasan there are two main areas. One floor is called Ling Ling where there is a small dance floor and a DJ mixing it up. Ling Ling also has a lounge area where you can just sit and have a drink. Going up one floor leads you to the main dance floor where Lil Jon was mixing and of course being himself. YEAH! WHAT! OK!

If you rub me the wrong way, I will ignore the staff and conduct business as usual.

First of all, the security and check in hosts were swift and polite, got through the guest list line in probably less than 30 mins (there were a lot of people)
Ahm... Btw... I'm sitting outside in the cafe writing the review right now, keep reading you will see why.
Anyway, the club set up is kind of like a dungeon\/beehive, I can get a little claustrophobic so I think the air conditioning could be tweaked a bit.
The third level ""Ling Ling"" had the most vibe for me and my crew.
The Pavilion was awesome as well, I will go ahead and express that we were shoulder to shoulder in every room basically.

Perhaps if I found the necessity to buy a $40 bottle of alcohol at a 250% profit, I would be more comfortable at a table.. But alas, my mind would not allow me to do that after calculating.

Anyhow, one of the friends... Made a close connection with alcohol and to say the least I was babysitting, after being asked by one of the attendants inside if I was having a good night, I pretty much told her that the girl lost her lunch on the other side of the room, she was so sweet and apologized about how my night was amounting, she saw me around a few times and then when she saw how bad the girl was, she explained that we had to go, no problem, we were leaving, a security guard helped her down the stairs, sooooo sweet and polite, we left and then here I am writing this review.

Please note. When you quit alcohol on a whole (Im training for a race) and step back to see how people react to it, it's either entertaining or annoying. Entertaining in the sense where it makes people absolutely insane and annoying in the sense--- you turn into a baby sitter!

For a nightclub that is supposed to be all the rage with top headliners, Hakkasan falls short. Sure, Hakkasan has great lighting and they frequently have great DJ's there. But what is the point of a nightclub if you don't have space to dance, get good drinks, or have decent customer service?

After going there a few times, it is evident that promoters and bouncers emphasize the importance of getting there early to avoid being turned away due to reaching capacity. This couldn't be farther from the truth. If you want to go to a nightclub that is a fire hazard then Hakkasan is the place for you. It is always super (SUPER) packed. With the exception of the few groups who managed to get a table, there is no room to dance or breathe without interjecting yourself into someone else's personal space.

That said, what is the point of paying $40 for a cocktail if the bartender doesn't even know what he is doing? Worst experience: I asked for 2 AMF's (a very well known drink that every reputable bartender should know) and instead of serving me a drink that is made up of different alcohols (the whole definition of Adios Mother F's) the bartender thought it was okay to poor a bit of 1 vodka, splash juice, top it off with curacao (gives it the blue color) and call it a day. Excuse me but what? And yes, they still had the audacity to charge for an ""AMF"".

To add to the Hakkasan experience, the bouncers at this venue always make sure to be disrespectful to guests (even when you have VIP). For some odd reason these ""gentlemen"" forget that they get paid to do a specific job that happens to include providing customer service. It behooves me why a respectable resort like the MGM would employ individuals who are more interested in looking good for each other than doing a good job and making a good impression on guests.

If you can't resist and want to see what the ""fuss"" is all about make sure to grab a cocktail beforehand. You'll need it.",6,2,0

Lines here definitely get long, even the bottle service line can get long, but that may be because the club doesn't start letting people in until 11...then it's pretty easy breezy after that.

Hakkasan is so beautiful, the music was great (Daddalife & Fergie DJ were there) and the staff was awesome.  Our bottle service girl was so sweet and the staff here was so attentive, they definitely kept checking to replace our mixes and take away empty glasses.  I noticed this more so than at Body English and Tao I must say where I've experienced a kinda shared bottle service experience.  Also, we ladies loved how the guys by the stairs would shine the light so you could see where your going as your walking down them and they offer you a hand as well...this should be a must in every club!

My girlfriends and I jetted to Vegas for a friend's birthday and of COURSE had to hit the nightclub circuit.

We ended to on a promoter's list that helped us avoid the insanely long line, as well as the long promoters line.  We sailed in immediately- despite the inexplicably CRAAAAAZY long lines.  When we got in the club, it was extremely claustrophobic, PACKED to the gills with people, smoky as you could even IMAGINE- whatevers generic house music.  The worst two features were the ""blast smoke"" machine from the stage, and the inexcusably crowded venue.  They had this horrendous machine that blasted smoke\/chalky substance all over the dance floor every 30 seconds.  

It was literally so crowded you couldn't move ANYWHERE.  Instead of agreeing to be seated with a table of guys we decided to GET THE HECK OUT!!!

Our entire group of girls agreed we would NEVER, ever, EVERRRRRRRR go back.  Even for free and with no wait like we had it.  Why people wait or pay to get in is beyond my comprehension.",2,0,0

Not gunna lie, it's the hottest club in Vegas and Tiesto tears shit up all the time. The crowd is massive and so is the club. If you're into PACKED ass sweaty clubs, this is the place to be. I'm sure hakkasan will be WAY better once the hype dies down. 

Venue wise, it's a dungeon. There's multiple sections, but I'm not into that shit. I like it when I can see the whole crowd and get excited at how many people there are. NO JOKE this place was WAY too packed when I went during memorial weekend. I mean like you're lucky if you don't have a bruise on your head. Plus everyone is on something so you're gunna be pushed around by people that don't know they're elbowing the shit out of you. 

Hakkasan bought out Tiesto and Deadmau5 which is tight, but how can you enjoy yourself if you can't even move? 

The history of how this club opened in MGM grand is pretty cool though. Supposedly the guy that opened it pushed unlimited funding into the club to make it the hottest club ever. Don't know the exact story, but i remember it was pretty interesting.

ANYHOW, GOOD CLUB. GOOD MUSIC, SUPER POPPIN and very CRACKIN'. But you're gunna be pissed if you're not SUPER intoxicated with something. I mean even if you were, you'd prob be super irritated. Anyhow, i love hakkasan, but only because we got a table. But when I tried going to the dancefloor i wasted an hour trying to get back to my table.

If you want to make sure you get in, buy a freakin ticket.  If you don't want to buy them, then quit bitchin.  Though they were not pleased, they even let in a couple guys wearing shirts I would wear on picture day in 5th grade because they had tickets.  Other than that though, guys were dressed nice and girls were dressed to impress.

Females, you are not special.  My wife and I got in the club at 10:30 with pre-sale tickets and we saw girls waiting in line in their six inch heels.  We had our fair share and were done around 12 am (east coasters) and left seeing the same girls in line.  Just because you put on your 6 inch heels and mini skirt doesn't mean you will automatically get it.  For every skirt waiting in line to get in free, there are 3 already inside dancing and getting their drinks paid for by a couple gullible guys.  

A few other notes:

A bud light bottle and carona: $20.00 total.  Expect more for mixed drinks.

Ling Ling bar was nice but crammed; if you want hip hop and dance, go there.  5th floor is for the EDM crowd.  Pick what you prefer but beware, the set up in all rooms are heavily catered to bottle service.  If they didn't try to push bottle service down our throats and decrease space for dancing, it would've been a more pleasant experience.  It will get crowded and sometimes unpleasant.  We preferred the Ling Ling Room but people cut across the floor quite a bit.

Stairs aren't that bad and they have elevators.  Again, grow a pair and deal with it.

Security was not bad or rude....we waited in line before they opened and they offered a bathroom for my wife, but she toughed it out.  I'm sure they deal with a number of douches all night.",0,0,0

That's the takeaway from here. If they didn't steal all these big-name DJs for the next 1.5 years, they would have no one coming. Since it wasn't built from scratch, you can tell it has age. There is no outdoor area which I feel is a new standard for Vegas clubs. Everything is small and enclosed. The drink prices are standard Vegas, but they charge you $9 for the smallest bottle of Fiji water and refused to acknowledge that there is free water unless you specifically say ""give me tap water"".

The dance floor is small and so when a performer comes on you don't get much of a view (although DJs don't really do much so I guess that's ok.) Also main headliners don't come on until 1:30AM so be aware of that. We came for Bingo Players and so the crowd was probably a little thinner; the upstairs 5th floor bar\/table area was pretty spacious so we ended up there. 

The feel and vibe of the place is more like Haze or Tao. I definitely prefer Marquee, XS or Surrender because of the outdoors. Really this wasn't a terrible club but given all the hype, waiting and cost of tickets, I was very disappointed. Once their headliners are off contract and move on, I imagine this place will be old news very quickly.",7,3,1
4000239,t09R99nZi97D-jEX5uRRhQ,-R3Liu8xDWu-VpWSW8YlKA,X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg,5,2014-07-27,"So I only went to one nightclub while in Vegas but I really think Hakkasan is the best.  I came here on a Thursday and a Saturday night.  

First thing you need to know about clubbing in Vegas is that you shouldn't have to pay for tickets in advance and you don't need to pay cover in most cases.  For events that are very popular or some big name DJs then you may have to pay.  When clubbing in Vegas you need to know about using promoters to get on guest lists and get the best deal.  You can find promoters through social media, internet search or on the strip handing out business cards.  These promoters will get you on ""guest lists"" and in some cases limo service and VIP service.  Try and connect with the best promoters to get the best deals.  

The first thing you want to do is show up early.  If you are just a regular off the street the line for Hakkasan will get long early.  When I say early I'm talking around 10 pm before the club even opens kind of time.  Any later you will find yourself in the ""guest list"" line for up to a hour and a half.  While waiting in this long line you may notice some people being picked from the line you are waiting in and taken to the front of another line.  If you pay attention you will realize why these people are selected to cut to the front of the line.  Promoters will hand pick the top of the line guests making you feel judged during the entire process as everyone is dressed to impress.  

The Hakkasan staff does a great job of managing this line with plenty of hands on deck taking down people on the guest list with iPads.  They also have other people checking IDs and stamping your wrist for approval.  Once you do make it to the door you will be check again and sent through to the payment counter inside. Here you will hand them the pink slip that was given to you by the people who checked you in with the iPad.  If you are a MGM guest you shouldn't have to pay to get in.  Guest list also didn't require cover for us.  I'm not sure of the rules and regulations night by night but if you play your cards right you shouldn't have to pay to get in.  

Once you are in you can either wait to take the elevator up or simply take the stairs.  There are a lot of stairs and you will realize this on your way out when you have to stumble down these flights after a night of dancing and drinking.  The middle level is the Ling Ling club.  This area is hip hop with booths in the middle and bars on the ends.  

If you continue up to the next level you will find the main stage area of Hakkasan.  There is really no bad seat in the house.  When I say seat I mean standing\/dancing spot unless you have VIP table service.  You enter directly in front of the DJ booth with stadium style set up with VIP tables on the main floor and on the second level.  There is a pit area right in front of the DJ booth for anyone to come down and dance and feel the smoke machines hit them right in the face.  

In both areas patrons are not discouraged from standing on their booth dividers or couches and dancing.

Drinks here are extremely expensive but I feel like everything in Vegas is.  For a weekend away I feel like you have to take this into consideration and really just let loose.  The lady and I had a Bellini and a 16 oz Bud light for $40 including tip.  At this price getting shots, mixed drinks, or even bottle service would serve as a more attractive option for party goers.  

Hakkasan is very clean and much like the staff outside I applaud the staff in the club.  They work on keeping high traffic areas clear of people standing and they are always clearing drinks and keeping the floor clean of any spills.  It is really a controlled experience in what usually or can be an out of control club life.  

The featured DJ set usually comes on around the 1 o'clock hour.  It really is the best club experience I have ever had.  I look forward to coming back and perhaps spending a little more on drinks during my next visit.",14,1,2

First I would like to say its Vegas, most places don't have a table or chair or anything else to sit on unless you buy bottle service. This is  the case in just about any club you go to in Vegas. Second, yes drinks are expensive as they are in any place on the strip or any clubs. 

For the atmosphere, it definitely gets crowded this club is more of a venue imo to see top DJ's. If you are trying to go somewhere to dance than this isn't the place for you. If you are going to see your favorite DJ and just want to jump up and down and such than this is your spot. I would definitely recommend getting there early and buying pre-sale tickets as you will get right in. The line ques were already long at 10:30 vs the presale line which my wife and I were ushered right in.

My friends and I had a really great experience at Hakkasan and I would go back. We went to see Calvin Harris and it was a truly amazing show. We had a table in the Ling Ling Lounge before the show and we enjoyed having a table to go to throughout the night that was a little bit away from the action. Our server was great and kept the drinks  flowing all night. When it was time to go to the main area to see Calvin, it was complete chaos, as expected. Yes, people were obnoxious and pushing, shoving, etc, but when are people not like that at these things? I had a blast though and would definitely go back and see him again. 

One word of advice, plan your visit to Hakkasan carefully. Make a contact with someone from the club when you book a table and make sure you have all the details prior, that way you know exactly where you need to be when and it will cut down on your wait time getting into the club. Our group was one of the first groups to be let in as we got a tip from our guy to get there around 10:00pm and it was a great piece of advice.

I like the show, I like the lights, I like the music and I like the women. I don't like the insane crowds, being packed like sardines, getting drinks spilled on me, the ridiculous cover fees, insane prices of alcohol and the kids trying to be a Bruno Mars look-a-like dancing like they are having an emotional breakdown on the dance floor. Maybe I'm just getting old but it just doesn't seem to do it for me anymore.

When I passed through the MGM I thought that Hakkasan looked to be pretty cool, not to mention it was only a few steps away so I didn't have to go walking\/commuting down the strip to get there.  The plan was to check it out once night rolled around.

I got to line kind of late (10:45) because I figured maybe I'd go to XS instead since I had never been there either but changed my mind and headed back to Hakkasan.  Needless to say, I had to wait in the general admission line for a good 45+ minutes before getting in.

Since this was a somewhat spur of the moment thing, I hadn't checked what the cover fee was so halfway through line I asked and it was $50.  Not really what I wanted to pay just to get inside but since I had been there for awhile already I said screw it and did it anyway. Not my proudest moment but I figured I just wouldn't drink anything. I hear the drinks go for close to $15 each anyway and anything over $9 or $10 to me is pretty much a rip-off, even for Vegas standards.

The decor inside was pretty cool. Simple but nice.  I didn't find it as cool as the interior of Tao or as cool as the pictures I have seen from XS but overall it wasn't bad.  Multiple levels, several views of the main DJ\/performance stage, large dance floor, several restrooms and tons of booths for bottle service.

As big as the venue appears to be, it got packed really quickly.  The dance floor was insanely crowded so much so that navigation was nearly impossible. . Tons of people were getting drinks spilled on them, I was getting bumped into ever nanosecond and worst of all, it was friggin' hot.  Tons of people dancing around drenched in sweat , bumping into you throwing elbows etc. while dehydrating took it's toll after about 30-45 minutes before I decided I have had enough and got off the floor.   There was occasionally confetti being dumped from above, fog\/mist being blasted on the floor, which should have happened with more frequency due to the temperature on the floor.  There were tons of kids on the floor some of whom didn't even look near 21 but then again, that's not really my concern anyway. It's Vegas. 

I ended up finding a place to stand behind one of the bottle service tables and watched the main show from there. The main show was a DJ duo called ""Dada Life"" who's name rang a bell but aside from that didn't really strike a chord with me.  I was actually hoping more to see Tiesto who performs there regularly but alas, it wasn't one of his nights.  The music was so-so but the show was pretty impressive, lots of lights and lasers, choreographed dancers, huge banana shaped inflatables (beach ball style) and even pillows being thrown from the roof into the crowd to add to the carnage.  It was a cool scene, just not sure it is mine.

This club is just okay.  Cover fees are too steep especially considering the fact the the prices for drinks are too steep.  Bad combo.  Clubs get crowded in Vegas but I guess I'm getting a little less tolerant of insane crowds, not to mention not having anywhere to sit down just becomes exhausting.  I don't regret coming here but at the same time I kind of wish I would have went with my original feeling and gone to XS instead.

Basically each time I go to a club in Vegas and fight the crowds I find that I'm probably going to be more of a lounge guy from now on. If I'm going to drop a lot of cash on drinks etc. I might as well do it in style and comfort and Hakkasan pretty much solidified that notion. If I end up going to another club in Vegas, I'll probably end up going to XS or somewhere where I feel that there is a little more value in the entertainment I'm getting.  It just wasn't there for Hakkasan.  I mean, it was real, it was fun. It just wasn't real fun.",10,9,9

Came on Saturday (4\/27) of Hakkasan's opening weekend. This place is seriously amazing for so many reasons:

1. Girl\/guy ratio was probably 10:1. Basically, it was a club full of girls, and then a small minority of guys who could afford to be there. Awesome.

2. Such a pro staff. Showed up with my wife at 10pm. No reservation. No ticket. Line at least 700 deep that I just wasn't going to deal with. Bless you, Drew, who referred me to Dave, who handled the situation like a vet. 2 line-jump passes later and we were in the door. 

3. The interior is awesome. Three different levels. A separate room for hip hop (Pharrell was celebrating his bday there). An incredible light show throughout.

4. The bottle service booths and couches were well monitored and looked super comfy and plush. 

Calvin Harris and Tiesto came on. J. Lo and her Kevin Federline dude were on stage. 

Overall, this was one of the best clubs I've ever been to. And I've been to many.

Regarding some of the other comments I've read:

1. Yes, there are alot of stairs. And I saw at least six girls go tumbling down them. Well, it is what it is. Don't wear the 5 inch heels if you can't walk in them.

2. Is it pricey? Yes. You know what? Deal with it. Or don't. But don't come expecting to get a Ferrari but only pay for a Ford. That's on you, not the club.

3. I agree that they let a few too many people in. The dance floor got suffocatingly packed and it was hard to actually dance.

But overall, a great vibe, a pro staff, and a really killer layout and design.

I will be back, Hakkasan. I will definitely be back!",7,4,4

I was employed there when it first opened for 2 weeks.  After retiring from 25 years in law enforcement I was looking for a fun job close to home.  What I saw was management allowing their international clients from Dubai assault and sexually molest guests and waitresses. When I physically pulled this drunk ""investor"" off a waitress as he tried to hold her down on a couch by her throat, I was told he was a very important guest and we should look the other way.  The drunk fool tried shoving money in my pocket as we escorted him to his room, where he announced how much he hated Americans and was happy about 9\/11.  When I returned to the club I found the waitress sobbing in the locker room and she thanked me for saving her.  The head of security and Neil Moffit both witnessed the attack.  The next night everyone just pretended nothing happened.  I informed them that I could not work for people who took money from rapists and terrorists.  They should be ashamed of themselves and know how what pathetic examples of men they are.  But when your club needs their oil money to survive, you let them rape your guests and employees in plain view. 

Be very careful when the hosts invite you into a private table with international guests.  They won't help you when you are being raped if the client is a big enough investor.",1,0,0

I am writting to you because we had a bad experience in Hakkassan Club. This incident occurred today June 26, 2016 at 12:52 a.m. I spoke with an African American bouncer and asked him how can we get in the second floor, he told us how to exit. While exciting the crowd a Caucasian bouncer started yelling at me and my group of 4 because we were exiting. He then started hitting her with elbowing her on the side. He then grabbed her and started shoving her. I told him there was no reason for him to touch her. After I had exited and was waiting for my group to exit out. I had met with them, the bouncer had yelled at use stating that we needed to exit out of Hakkassan, I was trying to record him and take a picture of him, he then yanked my phone and deleted the video. While all that was happening other bouncers escorted  us in the elevator and did not mention where they were taking us. It took us about 5 min to be escorded out. I will be filing a complaint with the BBB to document this incident and also I will notify my boss which by the way I am paralegal who work in personal injury. Our group was a witness of the incident that occurred. I also would like to add we were not drunk. The club was overcrowded and we were packed in like sardines. 


06\/30\/2016

I would like to add that I emailed by Mr. Garret and he stated that no footage of the incident was not able to be retrieved but stated on Hakkasan behalf that our group acted physically hostile with his 6'3 foot bouncer. Also, he stated that we no longer were welcomed at the club. I just want to advise all of you to enter at your own risk. You will packed up like sardines and they dont care. Place is overcrowded and their staff are unprofessional.",10,0,1

On the one hand it is definitely a classy, sought after entertainment venue for Vegas' young and beautiful- regularly hosting some of the world's best DJ's. The interior of the club is pretty spectacular, definitely a visual feast plus the music is good (if you're into that sort of thing) and everyone seems to be there to have a fun time.

On the other- the staff, especially the security guards outside the club, are very arrogant\/snobby and don't really make the experience of getting into the place a pleasant one. The prices are high if you are male OR in a group of predominately males and the dress code for them is so strict it is borderline ridiculous (but only for some if you get my meaning).

The club itself is packed to the rafters so if you don't have a VIP booth you will struggle to find space to breathe, let alone party. If you can afford it OR you can get a hook up I highly suggest getting one- you will seriously regret it if you don't.

The one redeeming feature was a lovely security guard inside the venue who helped me lock and erase my phone from his when I realised it had been stolen by a fellow patron.

Hakkasan is fun but I wouldn't be in a hurry to go again mainly because I like breathing and not having bouncers look down their nose at myself or my partner.",4,1,0

First, the positives. the sound and light show was impeccable. Tiesto never fails to disappoint  and this was the case here. 

Now the negatives. The place is dangerously crowded. Crowd \/flow is not at all well controlled. There were so many people packed on the dance floor that dancing for the most part consisted of being jostled around by people shoving their way through the sea of people. The staff are not extremely helpful in controlling the flow. I wonder if perhaps too many people were admitted....

From our arrival and throughout the nite we were treated rudely by all the staff...both outside and in. Get over the attitude, guys....so what if I am not a 20- or 30- something with a postage stamp skirt barely covering my derriere and wearing stilettos! I still deserve to party just as much as anyone else!

I go to a lot of  EDM music festivals and am not typically a big clubber even through I live in a major metropolitan area. However, the chance to party with Tiesto lured me in. I found the whole vibe here to be largely one of entitlement and arrogance which was very unlike any rave scene I have ever been in. . I did converse with some very nice people but they were few and far between.

The piece de resistance was when, about an hour after we got there, I was getting my groove on and minding my own business.....suddenly a young lady next to me who was obviously rolling started jumping and thrashing about. I held her at bay trying to squirm my way to a safer spot when she suddenly came down on my forefoot with the full force of her stiletto heel. The pain was excruciating. I tried to confront her and tell her what had happened but she just looked at me wild-eyed and slithered away.

What followed was an escape attempt by my party and I through the throngs of people as I was barely able to stand and almost in tears. I tried to get the attention of security to please help me but was ignored. After a few minutes we made it out with me in tears and limping. Thankfully no fractures but my foot is severely swollen and bruised and it has impacted my ability to do my job and everyday activities. I am in one of those ugly post-op boots for a couple of weeks.

I agree that no one could have predicted or been responsible for the behavior of this young woman. However crowding of a dance floor to this degree just invites these types of incidents. Its common knowledge that in a rave environment a lot of people are prone to be doing molly, coke or other rave drugs. Therefore, the staff should be prepared to respond to injuries when they do occur. I shudder to think what the outcome would be if there were a serious illness or injury, or other need to quickly evacuate. 

When I arrived home on Monday I wrote a long letter to the club management about my experience and they have not responded at all. Guess that shows how much they care.

My advice: if you go, wear steel toed boots and a suit of armor. Or better yet, skip the club, save your $$ and come join me at a music festival where you will enjoy a totally different experience without the attitude. And girls....those stilettos are not only extremely bad for your feet and ankles but are dangerous weapons.",5,1,0

The place is pretty popular so if you want to get in with no major issues I suggest arriving by midnight. My friends and I went this past Friday to see Dada Life and we were in line for about 30min going through the guest list line. Our promoter was Richie Laynes and he definitely made sure we would not have any issues at the door. Thanks Richie!

Once we were inside it was insane! Like I said, the club is popular so once you enter dont be shocked if you are immediately jammed in a room full of people wall to wall trying to move in all different directions. At some point we even lost part of our group because the 1st room you enter is the Ling Ling Room and some thought that was the main room. Nope! The main room is one more floor up. But once I found all of my friends we were able to make our way up to the main room with no problems.

The dance floor was packed so we went up to the balcony to watch Dada Life. Best decision ever! Even though the balcony area was full of people there was still room to dance and mingle. Getting a drink at a bar wasnt that bad either (however, be advised, drink costs are still in the $10-20 range).

What really made a good impression to my friends and I though were the Hakkasan staff, specifically their security staff. Ive been to nightclubs before where the security staff thought they were the best people on Earth, but at Hakkasan the security guards were just like regular people. I got the opportunity to talk to a few of them as the night progressed and I cant say anything bad about any of them. Every security guard I talked to were just some of the most genuinely nice individuals I have ever met (and if you've ever been to a vegas nightclub you know this quality is a hit or miss pending on the location because there's a lot of fake people in vegas). So to Elaine Codilla and her security staff, thank you for making sure my friends and I were safe the whole night and for taking the time to talk to us!

In the end, I recommend going to Hakkasan at least once while you're in vegas. If anything, do it just for their DJ lineup! Tiesto, Dada Life, Danny Avila, Calvin Harris, Fergie, Nervo, Moby, Steve Aoki, and Hardwell?! What?! That's insane!",1,0,0

I rate this club 2\/5 due to its layout. Basically the dance floor is super crammed and tiny which is because there are tables surrounding it.

Furthermore, every vantage point of the dance floor where one would usually stand or place their drink on the ledge, is also taken up by tables therefore leaving you to walk up and down the club looking for a place to stand\/watch because the dance floor is too packed.

Hakkasan, please read this! Remove some tables!! I was told they don't cost much anyway so just up the price or something.

Club has potential but unfortunately I have to recommend people avoid this place regardless of the DJ as you won't enjoy it.

It was a great time overall, but a bit too crowded for my personal preference.

The second time I went there I decided to avoid the crowds a bit and reserve a VIP table for the night.  I filled out the form on the venue's website and within a few hours received a text message from an absolutely awesome VIP host who arranged absolutely everything for us.  The minimum spend was only $500, but we ended up spending closer to $1,500 of course.  There were only three of us, so clearly table service at this place can be expensive.

This club is WOW-enormous with a 7,000+ capacity.  The entire Hakkasan monstrosity costs an estimated $200 million.  I'm gonna guess the technicolor lighting and massive video\/LED screens were not cheap!  It has five levels for its restaurant and nightclub with the greatest DJ line up of Deadmau5, Calvin Harris, Tiesto, Tommy Trash, and Aoki to name a few.  The club website has a great calendar of events so check that out if you are big into a certain DJ. 

I liked Hakkasan but I didn't love it.  There were definitely some things that made it just A-OK!   First it's all tables so they obviously want you to go there and spend money.  The pricing is also higher than any other club in the city by about 10%.  It would be better with less tables and more room for people to walk around.  Second there are a ton of stairs, even more stairs than Marquee, and I didn't think that was even possible.  Third it really reminds me of a dungeon, a ridiculously HOT dungeon.

Thursday and Sunday are the days to go if you are a local and wanna check this place out.  I'm recommending to avoid the Friday\/Saturday unless you absolutely must see your favorite DJ spinning.  I suggest, purchasing the pre-sale tickets and arrive early for check in if you go Friday or Saturday.",11,0,3

So here it goes....

Layout - 1\/10 - it's a weird cave like maze. Lots of random stairs. 

Crowdedness - 2\/10 - you can't dance, it's close to impossible. 

Music - 8\/10 - but I don't get why Calvin Harris needs to be there, anyone could just play his songs. If they weren't paying him whatever they're paying him then the place wouldn't be so expensive. Which brings me to....

Price - 3\/10  $10 for a tiny bottle of water, no free water. Ok. It cost me $100 to get in Friday night 17 May. The drinks were average price for a club in Vegas. 

The Staff- 9\/10- all class, no complaints. 

The wait - 2\/10 , too long at the door, too long at the bar. 

Overall it's just not worth it. 
This SUMS it up...........You'll wait in a long line for a long time to go into a horribly designed club\/dance floor just to bump into people and sweat, and not dance. And when you're all hot and sweaty just from moving around awkwardly touching everyone around you on the dance floor you can go get a $10 mini bottle of Fiji water. But it's all good cuz they have a famous DJ, who does nothing special, an iTunes playlist can do the same thing, and then he promptly exits stage left at precisely 1:30. Set over, doesn't say anything. So impressed. 

There is a lounge part on the third floor, and a hip hop area on the fifth, which I liked better. The main floor is 4th, avoid it, unless you have a table. And avoid this club unless you liked the way I summed it up.",6,6,2

I went on locals night, Sunday April 28th with a couple of girls. We got there at around 10PM when they opened at 10PM and waited for an hour, I guess that is standard. When we got inside, there was NO ONE INSIDE, uh, why did you make us wait this long again for no reason? Annoyed already.

Not only was the walk EXTREMELY far from the parking lot\/valet, there were so many flights of stairs that by the time I got to the top, my feet were too tired for me to dance. Talk about discouraging from the get-go. Oh, and if you think it ends there, it doesn't. There are stairs literally EVERYWHERE. My girlfriend tripped off of a 3-step stair because she didn't see it, not because we were drunk. Be wary.

Since it was opening weekend and locals night, I assumed that all the rooms were open and that they would have at least a decent DJ. WRONG. The ""Ling Ling Room"" aka the hip hop room was closed, WTF?! Closed on opening weekend?! Not only that, the music really sucked in the main room. I mean I am not that into EDM but I will groove to it if need be. Well, whoever played that night really did not know how to read a crowd. No one was really dancing.

Luckily, a promoter picked us out and escorted us into the club, so we didn't end up waiting any more than 20 minutes to get in, thankfully. Huge benefit of being a girls-only group! :)

The layout of the club itself is fun to explore, with multiple levels and several staircases & hallways & overlooks, feeling a bit like an underground (but not) crypt. The downside of this layout, however, is that there's a massive overlook (3rd level?) that isolates one area of tables such that they cannot see the DJ or dance floor. If you're getting a table and hope to see the DJ or have easy access to the dance floor, consider this layout issue! There seemed to be bathrooms on every floor, which is good for convenience and to divide up the usual lineup of women (still long lines, but they moved quick).

I showed the person with the guestlist the picture after she said my name isn't on there; even thought called prior to confirm my spot.

Inside was a bit crowded but not as badly as I thought!
The bartenders were rude for sure! They don't notice who arrives first and totally ignored our party for a good 10 minutes. It may have been rude in my part, but my party was getting upset so I pushed forward, snapped my hands in one of their faces, and told them we'd like to get some drinks.

Here is response from the director of security for Hakkasan nightclub: 

Thank you so much for your loyalty to Hakkasan Group. We are grateful that you chose to visit our venue, but disheartened to read that you faced some challenges in regards to feeling the security team was performing adequately.

For these inconveniences, I would like to sincerely apologize. Our goal is to ensure that each of our guests are comfortable and happy during their stay and we are truly regretful that this experience negatively impacted yours. 

Hakkasan Group venues have dramatically increased our security measures since last October in response to the tragic occurrences happening across the world. We have increased our undercover security and surveillance, and actively use metal detection and bag checks as you witnessed during your stay. We actively use uniformed police presence at all our venues, and retain the services of onsite paramedic units during each night of operation. The elevators you mentioned are controlled by an operator to prevent overload and potential breakdown from guest usage, and is regulated to prevent overload. Our exits are clearly marked and in full working condition as verified nightly, and the entire staff routinely goes through evacuation drills to provide the utmost service if such an event occurred on premises. 

In addition, all venues monitor capacity in real time, and the Fire Marshal performs nightly walkthroughs to ensure guest safety. I can say with 100% certainty that our venues outperform many of our competitors in being vigilant and taking a stance toward safety, and many of these tasks aren't advertised blatantly to keep our venues away from scrutiny of those attempting to do ill will.

So our promoter got us on the list there. I was shocked to read on here how many people pay to get in! Walk down the street or check instagram, there's always a promoter trying to get you on their list. They're literally asking you to go for free on the strip. Take their little card. Anyways, we had a short wait to get in, which I hear isn't typical. 

Club was jammed packed which I didnt mind and was kind of hoping for.

The club is FULL of stairs. Stairs to every bar, stairs to the dance floor, stairs to the bathroom, Stairway to Heaven-- you name it. I swear, my quads grew 10 inches that night. There's also literally no where to sit down besides the bathroom. Which, okay, I get it. You want me to get a table...So ladies, bring the comfiest shoes you own! You'll be having a workout. 

Typical over priced drinks but we got our first free. Only spent $40 on 2 well beverages.

Overall, I wish there wasn't so many steps and there was a place to rest your feet other than the toilet. Good music and had a good time otherwise. The other guests at the club were fun too!",0,0,0

This place is packed beyond belief. It's impossible to walk so don't even think about dancing. What makes it even more impossible is that there are stairs all over the place! And drink tickets only work on the upstairs bars and they expire at midnight which nobody tells you. Make sure this is the first thing you do because each drink will take about 20 minutes. 

I would never recommend this club. Pretty sure they are violating some safety regulations. They pack it double past capacity, I'm convinced. This club could have potential if you get bottle service but I don't even want to think of that pricing.

It's just not something I really see the point of. But it's the principle of the matter, so I'll make the exception right now. Rewind, it's my friends 25th. We're from the east coast. We go at around 9. Mind you, that's early because in NYC and NC where we're from you go out at 12 EARLIEST. We wait on this line that seems to have been like 500 people deep and stretches throughout the MGM Grand hotel. It's now two hours later, closer to the front but not yet there. Bouncer checks IDs. No one is mentioning cover or anything. We get to the front and we're told $150 pp for just a cover to get in. We look waiting for Ashton to come out along with his punk'd camera crew. Since, you know, that's insane\/ ridiculous. Nope. They were serious. 

So let me get this straight Hakkasan. You tell people to get there before 10 for free cover, hold the lines to make them long and DON'T let them in before that time. Then charge a high price? Good riddens. No. 

In hindsight, this was the month they opened so they were probably riding the ""I'm the new hotspot in vegas wave"". We were still annoyed and did NOT go inside. Tell people the cover before they wait hours on the line. Give them a choice. Would never return. I prefer hip hop anyway so 1OAK may be an option next time.",10,2,1

5. Beauty is in the eye of some DB promoter(s) at Hakkasan - This is the CON to ruin Hakkasan. Whilst in line, I assisted some girls in taking a photo of their group because front facing shots are no bueno a majority of the time. Then I overheard one of them say they had to send it to their promoter. Um all right. Odd. Then I saw another girl send a full length picture that she took of herself in her room to a promoter. Light bulb! Turned to my friend and said, ""If we have to send our pictures to our guy so we can get in, we are getting the hell out of this line because that's not cool.""  Fortunately, we did not. Hurray for upstanding promoter even though he misspoke about girls getting in free (see Meh category)!

My suspicions were confirmed when I got back home when I had lunch with a friend who told me his friend was in Vegas  with a group of girls the same weekend and had wanted to go to Hakkasan. They got in contact with a promoter who required her to send a picture of their group to him\/her. All of the girls in their group passed but one did not make the list. So they opted not to go.

I have dealt with multiple promoters (Marquee, XS, Tao...) but I have NEVER once had to send my picture to them. Nor should you have to! If the promoter wants to refuse service, they have every right to do so based on lack of ratio of boys vs girls, untimely guest list request, etc but to have to send a photo?! And they better not put out some PR BS about how they need to confirm the guest with a photo because that's what you check IDs for at the door! Plus, who knows what that skeevy promoter will end up doing with your photo! 

Ladies, find a nice promoter who does not require this. Hakkasan, get your promoters in check!


Pros:

1. MUY GRANDE- We covered three floors. The Pavilion has 2 floors and plays EDM: main stage and upper deck. 

The Ling Ling lounge is hip hop. 

Ceilings are high in both rooms so you don't feel too suffocated. Remaining 2 floors that were unseen are most likely for high rollers.

2. Bars galore - did not have a problem getting to a bar and getting a drink. Drink prices pretty standard for vegas. $15 for a shot of pat-ron.

3. With great space, comes great bathrooms - smart on the designers' part. Line for women's restroom minimal but I had better bathroom attendant experience at XS and Marquee. 

4. Got Ladies?  Pro for the Bro- I have always felt clubs had more girls than guys for obvious reason (we get in free) but there was an abnormally excess amount of women. Pickin's will be slim for she who goes to pick up a fellow. 

5. Elevator, what art thou? - We both got to enjoy a ride down the elevator when we exited the club. Other ladies were able to go upstairs via the elevator. A lot of the reviews on Yelp contradict this. Maybe we got lucky? But completely saved us from a grueling walk down like the one at Marquee. 

6. Music - both rooms: thumbs up


Meh

1. Free for the ladies? Yes. SIKE! - Waited 1.5 hours in the ladies only gl line to have to pay $20 at the door. Oh fine. Opening weekend. Ok. The price was at least $10 reduced from the price of presale which was $30 for girls. So I'm only pseudo-complaining.

Cons

1. So maany stairs - yeah there are lots to cover if you don't get lucky with the bouncer manning the elevators. And I gather most were not lucky.

2. No outdoor patio - I enjoy this aspect of XS and Marquee just because it makes the club feel more open. Sure, high ceilings make Hakkasan feel less claustrophobic but constructing an outdoor patio would have been a good idea. Perhaps there is one for the pool section of the club? We never came to this part.

3. Boy, is you a high roller, know a high roller, or a money-wise guy? - For the FEW guys that ladies will meet, they will either have been wise enough to purchase pre-sale tickets for about $75 or they'll have spent a lot of time in the casino to garner the Platinum status with MGM or you know a high roller and can ride in on his\/her coat tails . Or if you're a social butterfly you'll have gathered enough friends to live the Hakkasan dream of getting a table for $2G+. There is absolutely no gl for guys. Don't know if it's true, but guy's admission was $500 at the door but we were told by our promoter that it would have at least been $100+ at the door for men. Whomp whomp. 

4. Where can I get my dance on? - Hakkasan's architecture is definitely catered to the table experience.",4,3,3

We waited an hour + in the guestlist line that extended to the outside of the hotel and damn near wrapped around the block. It was seriously like waiting in line at Disneyland. To top it off, people were rude and tried to take cuts. Then once you get inside, it is overcrowded with no breathing room whatsoever. You can barely walk or dance without people bumping into you. There should definitely be a maximum capacity.  They are also really strict.  While in VIP, security kept stopping a girl from dancing on my guy friend.

We had a table reserved in the Ling Ling Club and had absolutely no issues getting in.  I could see how people could be confused - but this is a new place and they are still working out the kinks.  I think most of you might not remember when some of the other, popular clubs opened - they had tons of issues as well, and time has fixed that.  Give Hakkasan a chance and everything will be fine.

I am also pretty easily entertained, but I don't have a lot of patience....neither was a problem that night.  We were escorted to our table (a corner booth) in the Ling Ling Club, which was surprisingly crowded for 11pm at night.  I've seen a lot of complaints about there being nowhere to stand if you don't have a table - well I saw a bunch of people with plenty of room to stand (in the aisle).

We had an absolute BLAST!  Our server and busser were awesome and provided great service, security was very nice and the music was bumpin!  There was nothing ""ghetto"" about the music - have you ever listened to hip hop before?  The DJ played a good mix of current and old school music and our group danced our butts off.

We did not explore the rest of the club, because we were happy where we were at, and EDM is not really my thing , so I can't really speak about the rest of the club.  But I am REALLY happy that Hakkasan offers something for hip hop lovers.  The crowd that night seemed to all enjoy themselves (but probably came here to write bad reviews later...), and I consider the night a success.

The only negative thing I would say is that it is not a good idea to have the stairs as the main exit at the end of the night.  There were a lot of intoxicated people, and it makes for an interesting departure when you try to get down the stairs in your heels after a few cocktails.

I am reading other reviews on here and I am suprised (and thankful) that for as buzzed \/wasted pants I got when I was here, I still had a good time. 
So I came here Halloween weekend, on Nov 1st. Everyone was still pretty dressed up. I didnt want to wear my costume so I came in street clothes. My friend got a promoter to put us on a guestlist so we barely had to wait to get in, we also got there really early, we didnt want to deal with getting to the club at peak hours and waiting forever.

Once inside, its decieving. I thought it was smaller when I walked in (sober) as I got more intoxicated, I realized how big it is inside. My friend that I went with was having a rough vegas weekend, tired and lost her phone the night before at XS. She left about 30 mins into the night, but she knows me I am ms. social  as soon as she left i made new friends and had drinks given to me practically left and right. At one point I was on a solo adventure and ended up roaming around alone having a blast, UNTIL SUDDENLY.... I HEAR... Escape me by Tiesto.. and i rememebered that the reason I was there was to see him. I go and jam out to him and have a ball !!! 

I even met a cutie pie there that happens to live close to me and we are  hanging out soon... had a great time here, met cool people, saw Tiesto, didnt lose anything, and experienced a fun time.. this club is huge and dont forget the hip hop room downstairs..they were playing two chainzzzz :)",3,4,1

REALLY PACKED OVERALL. A bunch of chicks walking with heels in their hands since they don't even let them sit on the edges of the counters.

Soooo, why would I pay $100 as a guy and around $60 for my girl if they'll eventually let you in? DRINKS ARE EXPENSIVE. 
They say no kicks, tees or hats.....(YOU KNOW CASUAL CLOTHES), but there are times when there's a gang of under-dressed people with kicks and plain tees in the hip hop room. I guess you  must slip them a little dough for them to let you in your regular clothes??

Was not planning to go on this Vegas trip, but found out that Tiesto was spinning last night.   Although he is more pop now and has gotten away from his trance background, Tiesto still puts out a good party.

The venue itself was a little disappointing given all the hype about how much was spent on renovating.   Place was packed.   Dance floor was so packed.   I  understand that people are there to dance, among other things... But I did not see the staff cut off entry to the dance floor when it got too packed.   What resulted is you have too many people, and lots of rude drunk guys pushing you for space. 

The tables both in the hip hop room and the main room took up about 2\/3 of the space. 

Better off going to Drai's or Marquee which are better venues, and have more room to dance.

This happened in every part of the nightclub, so we make our way to the bar and since my group of girls is absolutely gorgeous we were getting drinks bought for us left and right. The bouncer actually has the audacity to tell us we can't stand by the bar. What kind of club is this, where exactly can I stand, and if I cant stand please bring me a chair so I can sit. I'd also like to mention the people they were allowing into the club, super underdressed not dressed to standards, I totally believe if they denied these people entry the club would have been bearable and my friends and I wouldn't have felt like a bunch of sardines in a can.

The positives is that they have an amazing sound system and the lasers take my breath away. They have a pretty stacked lineup in terms of DJs.
The bad is that the lines are ridiculous even if you're on the list, and they don't make the process any friendlier by any means. They basically act rather haughty. Once inside, their staff was rude to me. I accidentally crossed into the VIP side and barely had one foot over the line, and the bouncer manhandled me. No male should manhandle a lady, period, especially if she was making an honest mistake.

I don't know how to write this review without going into details about the night that I was there with my girls on 4\/20 (opening weekend)... but it was a memorable one!!!

Pros: 
x Lines move fast -- I think. I was a little tipsy.
x Bouncers\/security aren't rude douche bags.
x Temperature perfect at all times. Yay for no sweating.
x Good lights and sound great sound system
x Elevators
x 3 different ways to enter\/exit the dance floor
x contracts with top DJ's so you can always expect someone good to spin no matter what week you go!
x Areas you can get away from the music for a breather.

Side note: I wish I could comment on bar area\/service and drink prices, but I don't quite remember that part of the night :P JUST BEING HONEST HERE, don't judge.

Cons:
x Confused as hell where I was every time I was going up\/down the stairs. No signs.
x Some of the tables are all the way in the back, you can barely see the DJ.
x  Dance floor is a bit small in my opinion.

Our group assumed it was due to NYE why the club was so horrible so we tried it again another night.

We stayed at planet Hollywood (which was amazing!) Didn't do a whole lot of spending money since we knew at tiesto drinks and things would be escalated prices.
We walked from planet hollywood to hakkasan, stood in line (which everyone was confused on the different lines) then had a security guy go through the line, look at my fiancee shoes and ""out of line. You have to change shoes. They won't let you in."" We were completely confused. Especially since the 2 guys behind us had on old dirty polos, cargo shorts and Sperry shoes! So we step out of line. I see 4 security guys talking by the door. I ask them seeing as we were given incorrect info and my fiancee didn't bring dress shoes and we won't be let in, what the refund policy was. One guy immediately said, ""if you were told wrong and didn't get to use the tickets there should not be a problem getting your money back"". 
We walk all the way back to the hotel, gumming mad and pissed that the one event we really wanted to do, we now can't! We get to our room and my fiancee immediately calls hakkasan. They give him the run around and he persists. Finally the guy takes his name and number and promises to have a manager call him the next day.
This happened Saturday October 4th 2014. It is now October 10th 2014 and guess what.....NO CALL BACK!  
Such a waste of money for several employees errors, if they want to enforce a dress code, they should be more specific than ""business casual"" 
What a waste and I will NEVER recommend anyone give them a penny! Horrible customer service and by the other revirws, unless you want to give them millions of dollars, they don't care about how they treat you!",1,4,0

We bought our tickets online for $35 each.  When we got there around 11:30 or something, there was a massive line outside.  We were in a separate line and probably got in within 15 minutes. 

The layout at Hakkasan is kind of strange because there is one stairwell onto the dance floor and VIP tables that they won't let you use.  You have to go all the way to the back towards the DJ booth and go down to the dance floor that way.   With a group of 8 girls, someone was bound to get lost.  Good thing I was lost with one other person and not by myself.  We finally found our group after about 45 minutes of searching.

The place was crowded but we had a great time.  They had awesome music and fun lights throughout the entire night.  Drinks were expensive, obviously.  The bartender that was making our drinks most of the night was AMAZING! Loved him.  Not only was he entertaining and sweet, he was from Massachusetts :).  Boston love.

Anyways,  the only annoying part of this night was the little snotty chick who was at a table who kept glaring at my friend to get off this little stage area we were dancing on because SHE wanted to go on it.  So she lied and kept talking trash to her saying it was a part of their table they paid for. LIES.

But overall, had a great time at Hakkasan and I will be back!",3,1,1

Lil Jon was playing that night so it was super packed, as in you can't even dance or move because everyone is pushing and shoving each other. It's such a fire hazard and honestly it's not that fun when there's that many people since you can't even dance.  Someone call the fire department! It was getting defensive! you have to aggressively dance in order to get people off of you. Man everyone likes to start fights in here.

Their dance floor is super small compared to Marquee and XS, I suggest going to the second level if you want to avoid getting bruises. I heard this is usually and EDM club and I hate EDM but luckily that night it was Hip Hop since Lil Jon came out.

Packed but not too badly overcrowded, you could actually go up and down the dance floor, and by the end of the night I got to the 1st row right by the DJ booth. Ended up going by myself to see Tiesto since I happened to be in Vegas that night. Purchased a presale ticket, went in without too much wait around 10PM. Had to wait 3 hours until Tiesto came out, since big names start around 1AM to close. 

Second time was on a Saturday in July. NUTS!! My husband and I were on the guest list and got there right on time, since around 12:20 they closed the guest line right behind us. We had to wait about 20-30 min to get in. Then around 1AM it go SO ridiculously crowded we couldn't move. They don't allow you to stand in the stairs for obvious safety reasons, but there was nowhere else to go! Where are we supposed to go?? They let us in but then we couldn't stay anywhere close to the dance floor, which was so packed they were not allowing anybody there anyway. Tiesto came out and I was SO excited, but I couldn't even see him at all in spite of my high heels. That's how crowded it was. We kept getting bumped into by wasted people and it was only around 1AM...Decided to check out the upstairs. You can't get anywhere close to the viewing area up there unless you have a table (which will run you several thousand $$). No screens, no experience, nothing. It was so incredibly packed, we decided to leave after only around 45 min. SO BUMMED. We went to Vegas just to listen to Tiesto drop some beats, which he is amazing at, but the club is having trouble handling the crowds. 

Just don't allow so many ppl in!! I know it's big $$ but I'm sure the club was way beyond safety capacity that night we were in. It was just nuts. You could barely stand without moving. No room to walk around, much less to dance or go get a drink.

Everyone seems to be OK with it as long as they don't purchase a table. I'm sorry but if I'm going to pay to go into a club, I'd like at least some kind of experience and for the club owners to show some respect for the clubbers.

Worst part is, I know I'll go back because of the awesome DJ line-up they have, but I'll try getting several ppl to go with me and maybe we can book a table. This last time was just miserable.

  I had a friend who comped me a table and bottle service last night, apparently the promoters forgot it was a SATURDAY night in sin city and booked way too many tables. Got there at 10 pm with my group so we could get in, but nope did not happen. I was in line until 12:15! Treated like dirt. One particular person kept contradicting himself and being a douchebag.

I basically had to shove myself in a promoters face to ask why it was taking so long and if it was even possible to get in. By the time they finally got back to me my friends were so fed up and so was I, so we left. Do not go to this club, not worth it.

We setup the booth well in advance and it was easy for us to get in.  It's a mega-nightclub in Vegas, you have to expect to wait if you don't have things setup in advance....it cracks me up to read the reviews complaining about the lines, etc.

The bottles were reasonable....Magnum of Patron & Goose for $950.  Our VIP server was very accommodating and attentive, keeping our mixers full and replenishing our bottles when they emptied.  We had 16+ people in our booth, so the alcohol was being consumed pretty fast.  I have no idea what the final damage was for the evening....well over $5000.

Now for the music....Deadmau5 was simply amazing.  He came on around 1 am and tore it up.  There wasn't a bad spot in the club....the club is engineered well and the bass\/highs\/mids were perfect throughout.  I didn't want the night to end, it was that good.

1 level below the main floor, there's a Hip Hop lounge and a Hip Hop room.  We did wander there for a little while to check it out before Deadmau5 came on.  The lounge was dead....only 5 or 6 people there.  That was strange....I bet they change the format of the music within a week or two.  The main Hip Hop room was jammed packed.  It too was well engineered for sound and lights.  I like how they put it in the center of the room and there's a walkway that goes around the perimeter...it makes for easy people watching and access to the main floor.

The light show was amazing and added so much to the energy!  I like the fact that there are places where you can stand and watch the DJ (some of the clubs here make you keep moving like cattle).  Once Nervo came on and we hit the dance floor, everyone was super cool and the vibe was great.

But it really wasn't as bad as folks have said. Just go with comfortable shoes. 

Anyways, I visited 2\/1 for Oliver Heldens. Promoter wanted us in by midnight so we arrived at 11 and walked in main room by 1130. Being locals we parked across the street at the Trop (to save on walking). Entering that side puts you right next to the door however they have you walk all the way around Centrifuge Bar to get to the Guestlist line(s). While walking around we notice a huge crowd at the GA entrance...oh no. 

Guest list is split in two next to the soon to be leaving Rainforest Cafe...staff list then general. This is where they have the mandatory coat check. While here they will check your ID stamp you, then come by with the list and give you your Comp ticket. 

From here you walk into the actual structure of Hakkasan and into one of 4 ticketing lines...yeah, just like at Disneyland. Next you're down another hallway and into the elevators.

Overall the club is nice. They have used very rich materials. I like the use of stone especially. It does feel like a cave in spots but I feel like it was probably to make the open spaces feel even bigger. 

My favorite place in the club is the mezzanine. Perfect view of the stage, not to mention video monitors so you can have an up close view of the talent. It got bonus points for no line at the bar and its own set of moving lights. 

And I guess we lucked out because we didn't have to experience the exit stairwell. After experiencing that climb at Marquee...so glad. 

Pros
- Very organized and fast moving guestlist experience 
- multiple levels open to all guests. The upstairs bar had zero line. Not sure if they allow this all the time but even if getting table reservations Id recommend it more. 
- Lighting and production is top notch. Surprised they were already shooting confetti before midnight. 
- liked how it felt like there were areas to discover. The marriage between the old school clubs with lounge areas and the festival stage. 

Cons
- I can see how on a night busier than it was it would be a cluster of a place to visit. Outside of the dance floor there are very few areas to chill and enjoy the scene that aren't a walkway. 
- as with most Vegas club, the tables take up most of the space. As with restaurants I'm sure they've calculated how many they need to make a nice profit so it is what it is. 

So after visiting, would I go back? I say, probably. But more likely if it is a DJ that isn't playing elsewhere. We have a few other clubs that I feel mesh the VIP and GA crowds in a way that doesn't piss one side off more than the other.",3,1,0

I was really excited to visit HKLV so i bought pre sale tickets online for a reasonable 35$ Thursday NERVO show for me and four friends.  I read a lot of reviews here and went with my gut-instinct that told me ""you can't base your decisions of what some people think, just go and form your opinion"".

I was disappointed in Hakkasan.  Although entry was very quick, that was probably the best part of my experience.  You ride an elevator and enter into the space, and yes, you immediately recognize that the dance floor is big.  Then you notice how dark the club is, with its weird grey alien ship like interior.  A quick stroll reveals the second floor to offer great views for those with table service, and not for general admission.  It is cool to see the main table room where you can observe from up high, but that gets old quick.
A trip to the Ling Ling Lounge reveals a very small, perfectly square room with tables on the outside and some kind of tiny common lounge dancefloor space ish in the middle and a bar at one end.  you are forced to walk in a circle around the club, and are either put back into the cycle, or are ejected out.  we were in there for 10 minutes at most.
It becomes underwhelming fast, especially when you compare it to XS or Marquee - which both offer outdoor integration, pools, lots of room to explore, and at XS, gambling!

If you absolutely HAVE to see a dj there, then go and see the club - but by no means would I ever pay the 75$ pre sales ticket price for a friday or saturday, no matter who was playing, not even dada life or deadmau5.

I thought this would really live up to the hype, but it didn't at all, and only left me loving XS more than ever, which I never would have thought possible.",0,0,0

The line was ridiculously long this night. When we finally got to the people with iPads they told us the same 40 for guys and girls free. So we were like cool that sounds good but once we got to the booth they said guys 125 and girls free .

I'm never one to complain about price in vegas but this place is ridiculous. First off this review is based on my most recent visit in November (never had time to write a review).

I gamble a lot when I'm in vegas thus hotels tend to comp me crap all the time. This weekend I just happen to win an unusually large amount so instead of having me so elsewhere to get wasted and gamble there afterwards, so my host offered me a table at Hakkasan.

It was just 4 guys so we said screw it. When we got there it was nothing like my host promised, they threw us in a dark corner instead of on the dancefloor (strike one). After i got pissed and contacted my host, 40 mins later they finally realized who i was and offered me a table next to the owners table on the main floor with 2 free bottles but they kicked out a group of ppl who probably paid a GRIP of change for that table and relocated them in the back shit hole that we were in. Eventhough I was the beneficiary of it, i cant help but imagine myself in their shoes, the table was a 5k table (strike two). Only reason I come here was bc the DJ lineup is always legit and the women are top notch but as the night went on a few of my boys got 'intimately close' with the girls while dancing. Normal vegas life right? wrong! Security kept pulling them apart like a high school chaperone. Ive seen worse shit happen in the club but thats why so much $$$$$$$ is spent as long as no trouble was started. Security acting like paranoid parents at their daughters' first dance (strike three).

Not to lie this is the best club in Vegas right now (i still prefer Marquee, XS, and now Omnia, who is owned by the same group as Hakkasan). Most likely will come back for the awesome DJ lineup they have signed and as I get comp'd by MGM but it will not be my first choice. 

Fellas, dont come here unless youre willing to spend a grip of money (ladies, if you arent getting table service, this is where you wanna be).",1,3,1

We got in within seconds. The music and vibe of the club was amazing. So here is why I gave it three stars. I had my iphone5s and cash stolen from a purse. I had my purse on me the whole time but we were in the dance floor which was elbow to elbow before I knew it someone unzipped my purse and took my items. I then informed a guard who then called the lead guard of the place. He asked me who I thought it was but I wasn't too sure because there was a lot of different people around us. He then informed me that without me being sure he couldn't search anyone because it would bring a possible lawsuit to them. I was very upset and shocked that someone stole my iphone mostly cash can be replace but my phone had a lot of information. So basically my advice to others is to be careful and cautious when attending this club. One good thing about this place is that when we arrived we received a extra stamp to come back in again later. The guard was helpful but I know they have the best cameras that he could've looked into. Oh and drinks are about $20 bucks each. Last thing they do have an elevator so you don't have to take those long long stairs.,1,0,0

Other than that, this place is chill.  If you roll with a bunch of girls, they usually comp you a table but only after you send them individual pictures of each girl.   My friends and I came a couple weeks ago and got a table behind the dj and a couple free bottles.

I have been to lots of Vegas night clubs and was initially very excited about this place.  Then a couple of things happened.  I won't focus on the standard super long lines or the $17 well rum and cokes I bought.  Or the fact that like many others here my friends cell phone was stolen.
I'm more interested in the things at this club that can cause danger to life and limb.

1.  They would not serve tap water at the bars.  We were told we would need to buy $9 bottled water.  I told them my friend was ill and they still would not serve it.  So we left the club (knowing we would not get back in - no re-entry).  I was able to get a glass of tap water at centrifuge across the way - when I asked for a second one some manager said ""while hakkasan is open we can't serve tap"".  This I extremely dangerous in a setting where there is an obligation to stay in the club given the no reentry policies in the setting of capacity overload.  There were no obvious water fountains as well. I'm currently reviewing the state statutes regarding the serving of water in restaurants and bars in Nevada and will addend this review for those who are interested.

2.  The club was way way over capacity.  This is more dangerous because this club is very poorly designed.  The dance floor especially on the main stage on floor 4 is difficult to access safely and the way the club is designed there is no question in a fire or emergency people would get trampled and die.  It's like a maze, and there are a wall of booths between the bars and the dance floor with only a few winding ramps down to dance floor on the sides of the booths.  With so few access points people get shoved.  When my friend was not feeling well I tried to exit the nearest stairwell near one of the winding ramps with an emergency exit sign, I even told the bouncer at that stairwell it was an emergency and we were leaving and he forced us to navigate through the over capacity club to the main stairwell.  Im considering emailing the fire Marshall at sfm@dps.state.nv.us

You might consider it too.

The line was an absolute breeze! Checked my UFC 213 ticket and was in the club within 5 minutes. The after party was actually in the ling ling room. I made the mistake of going to the main room(kaskade was on). I figured out I was in the wrong room and made my way Over to ling ling down the hall. Ling ling is a hip hop club so def more my style . 10$ for a beer but hey it's vegas and you're at the best club in town. My tip would be to buy the Budweiser platinum.

Admittedly, I am not one of ""the beautiful people"" who feels comfortable sporting a dress with my back end practically exposed...I AM a dancer, but I really don't know how to ""club"" dance.  
The last time I went to a club, was about six years ago, and I hated it.

This Friday night, a friend of mine invited me out with a big group to Hakkasan, saying that they could get me in for free.  

I decided to give it a go, and not be a party pooper...just because I didn't like it 6 years ago, doesn't mean I won't like it now.

We arrived, and there was a SWARM of people waiting to get in.
The friend who had the ""hookup"" went and talked to security, and apparently it wasn't completely free..to get 4 people in, it ended up costing $160.  The friend took care of it, and told us not to worry about paying her back, which...to be honest...I wouldn't have gone in had I known that she had covered THAT much money for us.  I'm sorry, but I'm not used to having to pay a cover when I want to go and dance, let alone pay $40 a person.  

So...strike one, too expensive to get in.

The place itself is beautiful.  They have candles and incense lining the halls.  Its two stories, so if you don't want to get caught up in the madness that is the dance floor downstairs, you can go upstairs, where its not quite AS busy.

The music was great.  Above and Beyond was playing that night...we actually didn't stay for them, but whoever the DJ was before them, was excellent.  I enjoy EDM and Electronica, even though I'm not super skilled at dancing to that kind of music.

The dancefloor was jam packed.  Uncomfortably so for me.  I have a tendency to be a bit introverted, and claustrophobic at times...so next time, I'll either bring money to drink so I don't care, or I'll stay upstairs and dance there.  

It was a great experience, but let me tell you, don't go to this place without PLENTY of money for alcohol if you're going to drink.  We got a vodka cranberry for $16.  That's a bit extreme, even for being downtown...

I liked it.  I'd like to go back, but only for musicians that I really know and like...if Krewella plays there I'll be back for sure....in the meantime, I'm going to put some money aside for drinks for when I do go.  ;)",5,0,2

Also a section off the side of the main area called the Pavilion were its close enough to all the craziness but far enough to breathe and have A LOT of room to move. Lastly, (my favorite)...

And a final warning, hold tight to those purses and constantly check your pockets. Pickpocketing has been and is still rampant here. My friend's two friends both noticed their purses were open and their phones were gone just this past weekend.

The only thing good about Hakkasan is that MGM has good DJs for their residencies so it's always a party if you have nothing in your pockets for some rando to steal.",3,1,0

I had an AMAZING time at Hakkasan this past weekend, especially when you were on the decks, but many of my friends did not because their cell phones and wallets were stolen right out of their purses while they were on the dance floor. Could you please speak to Hakkasan management and urge them to increase security or safety for their patrons so that cell phone theft rings don't attack good people just out trying to have a good time?  

I don't have an exact number but I spoke to at least 20 girls who were pick-pocketed this past Saturday night (6 of which were in my group of friends) and many lost such valuables as their cell phones and wallets (including their IDs), which means their Vegas hopes and dreams were pretty much sunk as soon as they were ROBBED under the watch of Hakkasan Management.

Anyways, I know this is a shot in the dark and you may never even read this, but in the off chance that you do PLEASE bring this to the attention of Hakkasan management so that this type of thing doesn't happen again. I just don't want these thieves running around Las Vegas ruining anyone's good time. 

Thanks for listening and keep making beautiful music...YOU ARE THE MAN!

Love,
Mike",41,24,19

I understand this part of the strip has been pretty dead and they've been trying to bring some life back into this part of town but they could have spent a bit more time looking at other clubs and seeing how they could have one upped them. 

Went pre-opening weekend to see Hardwell and it was awesome. Lights and sound were awesome along with the endless amount of confetti. That air thingy though sucks. I mean I can barely feel it.

Went a bit early to get in and that took forever. I mean it was SLOW and after I went in, it was still empty. Stairs weren't was bad as Marquee but dark enough for a drunk person to eat it. Dance floors are a bit bigger which is nice. Did I mention there's a large abundance of restrooms?

I'll be back depending on DJ and because of my friends but this place lacked a lot of things such as an open area to sit down. I mean other clubs offer crappy seating but at least that's something instead of nothing. Tables aren't really going to cut it especially when you can't even sell out all the tables. Oh did I mention drinks are bit pricier here?",6,1,2

The layout of this place is awesome. When the elevators door open and you walk into the main room its POPPIN'.  We ventured into the different rooms and had a blast in the hip-hop room awhile. That room was small but the music was so fun and oldschool and brought me back many memories! 

As the night progressed we met up with our friends at a table upstairs looking at the DJ. We could see the entire club dance floor and had a perfect view of Calvin Harris. Sitting at a table is nice in here because it gets super packed and I was able to rest my feet and enjoy the cocktails\/show. There was confetti and smoke blast galore! I tried to dance on the main floor once but it was too much for me...but I expected that on labor day weekend. Another big plus for me was the ventilation of this place, I never felt too hot!

Going up the stairs to the 3rd it was a dance floor the size of a standard living room with 4 VIP sections in it! Ohhh, & good luck getting a drink there. 
The 4th was a little better. Getting there you definitely feel like you're in a Indiana Jones movie. The dance floor as you enter is double the size but also 4Xs the people (did not get better\/worse and I was there 12am - 2am). To the left there are more VIP tables and a much larger room. Again, way too packed. My group ended up dancing by the bar. In all, seems like the club allows more people then they should. 

Piece of advice for girls: they may force you to check in your jacket if you're a girl-- so either don't bring one or make your group waits with you if you do. I argued but apparently jackets with zippers are not allowed (lame). Because of that I had to check in my coat and I let my group go on without me. When you leave your group and they pay ahead of you.... That is a waste of money b\/c you have to pay again bc you didn't walk in with them. They also weren't allowed to come down to get me when they were told otherwise. Thus Hakkasan staff split me and as a result they made me pay double.

my gfs and i waited in the long guest list line for about 5 mins, when a spiffy looking dude, neo (?), approached us and asked if it was just us..and walked us in. thank you lawd, the only saving grace of this weekend. like i've said before, there's some people who just have more authority than others and can make things happen.

Anyway, besides the long lines and the JAM-PACKED and OVERCROWDED space\/rooms (which I am aware of because after all, it is a club right?), I also did not like the music (before the headlining DJ came on) and the policy here.  The drinks average nearly $20 each and water is a whopping $9 for a tiny fiji bottle.  They DO NOT serve tap water so you have to buy a tiny bottle of water just to stay hydrated.

Hakkasan hosts world class DJs such as Tiësto, Steve Aoki, Hardwell, Zedd and many more. 

Hakkasan's Asian-fusion lounge and eatery will tantalize your palate on the first level. For a more private dining experience Hakkasan has designed a more private dining oasis on the second level. The Ling Ling Club on the third level is one of my favorite places that provides plush private seating for you and your guest to enjoy a more intimate time and listen to some
down temple melodies. 

On the fourth level lies the main nightclub where you will see the best world class DJs 
and experience cutting-edge technology in light and sound that will have you begging for more! The fifth mezzanine level overlooks the dance floor and providing an area for guests who desire a more private VIP environment while still having access to the energy of the main club.

HOWEVER!! My friends and I almost got kicked out because the security thought we were smoking weed!! ARE YOU SERIOUS???? WE DON'T SMOKE IN GENERAL! No weed, no cigarettes, no vape, no hookah. Picked the wrong group of people for that.

The security stepped up and said ""you guys gotta go"" we simply asked why, and he said ""you guys are smoking weed"" LMFAO we argued for a good 5 minutes. We were about to get kicked out FOR NO REASON! We were livid, it seriously killed our mood. My boyfriend told him to smell his breath and he finally said ""you're good"" but still continues to harass my friend telling him that he's the one smoking weed because he smells it. My friend hasn't even touched weed in his LIFE! All because he was dancing and moving his hands around so the security thought he was passing ""weed"" around. 

It was so ridiculous, after arguing back and forth, he finally left us alone but still made a smart remark saying ""I'll be watching you guys"" how would you feel if you got blamed for something you didn't do then have the feeling of someone watching you all night??

Let me start chronologically...We were going for my best friends bachelor party - 2 girls and 6 guys. 1 of the girls was given a hook up since she worked at MGM and knew some people. We were put on an upgrade guest list that would get us out of lines, comp the ladies and give the guys discounts. This was an absolute hassle and it seemed that every door NAZI was ruder than the next. No one knew anything and at one point when my friend mentioned she worked at MGM the door douche said, ""So?"". Eventually we got in at an increased rate. How nice...we were told it was a last minute change.

So once you get in it's a dizzying maze designed to keep you there whether you want to be or not. And the stairs you've maybe read about - yah... They are everywhere and doesn't seem well thought out for a place that's patrons are getting trashed. 

If you don't have a table, plan on walking around in circles since you are not truly allowed to stand in one place for more than a few minutes. Yes - bouncers will ultimately tell you to move on every ten minutes or so. Likely since they over-pack the crowd well well beyond the 880 capacity plaque you can view as you walk in.

We were getting tired and just needed to sit a second. Nope! Not happening.

Attempting to get onto the tiny dance floor is a nightmare and due to the overcrowding, annoying bouncers and drunk douche bags hitting you with elbows, dropping drinks on you and rubbing all over your girlfriends and friends whether they like it or not. Funny how that stuff isn't being managed like NAZIs. 

Oh and just when we were finally fed up with being booty bumped and elbowed and rubbed on for an hour we tried to leave the dance floor - NOPE! Not allowed to leave! Someone - wouldn't say who was coming down the stairs... Who cares? My friend was having a panic attack and needed to leave the hot, overcrowding punch in face-fest ASAP. They were rude and argumentative towards her. There were clearly other ways to get out but they locked us in. Who does this?? How is this professional?! So if I'm dying I got to wait first??? Not good. Experience ruined.

After 10 minutes are arguing and 5 different bouncers - one let us out the other way. Finally, but clearly much to the anger of the other assholes. God only knows why.

Once we got out, my friend needed crouch down on the hall floor against the wall and away from crowds to catch breath and calm down. Within no less than a minute another bouncer informed her there was no sitting! Are you kidding me?!?!? 

Needless to say that was it. We left and we'll never come back. I'm sure they don't care since we weren't high rollers, but most people aren't. Most people simply want to see a great DJ and have a good time. This place doesn't allow for that.

THE LINE... 

First, if you get in a ""VIP Guest List"" and are told to simply go up and tell them you are on it, they will put you in a long ass line that was at least 800 people deep.  We went on Thursday, July 3rd - it was not a Tiësto night. When we got in line (about 10:35pm), it wrapped out to one of the doors near some restrooms - total time in line to get to the people actually checking the guest list ~1 hour.... Your ID *will* be checked - depending on how young you look, maybe a few times. Saw someone kicked out of line for having an expired DL too, so make sure you have a good one!  There were people in line with tickets for the night ($30)... So, that doesn't get you in any faster FYI. 

DRESS CODE...

Guys... There is a sign that states ""dress code strictly enforced.""  I knew I was good... Figure if i can dress appropriately, everyone else should, right? WRONG! There were guys in line that got in wearing cheap solid color t-shirts, sleeveless t-shirts, and even tank tops. A few got in wearing polo shirts (borderline for a ""high end"" club if you ask me).  Guys - wear a button-down shirt for goodness sakes!  Ladies were mostly dressed appropriately for the scene - but, I haven't been to many clubs where the ladies do not know how to dress. 

GETTING INSIDE...

After you are ""checked off"" the guest list, you approach another (final) ID check. Your wrist is stamped a second time and you are ushered to the register to pay to get in. Yes, we were on the guest list and didn't have to pay that night - the people that check you off earlier in line, issue you a ""pass"" telling the cashier how many males vs. females in your party.  You turn in that paper are handed a receipt, and then ushered into a bank of elevators which they pack shoulder to shoulder... Ugh! 

ONCE INSIDE...

The elevator doors opened on the 4th floor and in you go to a hallway leading up a couple of stairs to the dance area. The first thing I noticed is the relatively small (read - packed) dance floor.  The dance area is surrounded by VIP tables\/booths. There are a few bars around the outskirts of the floor\/VIP area. As for decor, well... I think a friend put it best in reaction to a video I posted on Instagram... It looks like a black box with lights inside!

If you are not a smoker, beware - you will get smoke in your face in this place. Sometimes you are walking along and poof! you walk into a cloud of smoke thanks to another patron. 

We also explored the 5th floor, figuring one could look down on the dance floor below and see the DJ, etc. Another disappointment here... Once you get upstairs, the only way to look down on the floor and see the DJ, is if you have one of the VIP tables\/booths up there. Otherwise, you are at least 6-8' back from the overlook and can't see anything really. 

BAR...

It's Vegas, so I figured it would be around $14-16 for a drink here. Ordered 2 goose with pineapple = $40 including tip.  The ""glass"" tumbler is plastic (I've been to ""cheaper"" clubs and they serve in actual glass - guess this place ""can't afford"" the glass???  As for the alcohol to mixer content - I would say it was average. Not terrible, but not $20 worth in my book. 

BATHROOM...

You would think that a place the size of this one would have a decent restroom facility. I am sad to say that NO, it doesn't - at least the one I went to.  Once you get inside the bathroom, an attendant pretty much keeps things in check and""assigns"" you a urinal or stall based on availability... Sound great, except that there were only 3 urinals and two stall that I remember seeing. Once done, the attendants are extremely courteous and do their job really well - tip them, as it may be the only thing that actually worked well!

OVERALL...

I would NOT go again, unless there is a special event going on where I know I will see a favorite DJ. Even then, I would be hard pressed to pay for a ticket or be on a VIP guest list. The only way to do this place right is probably to get a table, and from what I understood is definitely in the thousand$. 

Can't wait to get back to Miami to go to a real nightclub!",24,4,4

Literally having the best night of my life! The only time I go to this club is when Calvin Harris is performing. (I am huge fan btw!)  
I recently went to Las Vegas this past weekend for Valentine's Day weekend and I went to this nightclub on Friday. Going inside the club was very smooth, the people who work there were very friendly and kind. My boyfriend unfortunately had to pay $110 to go inside the club. (I think that's a bit ridiculous too be honest.) I got to go inside the guest list and got in for free. When we got there it was a bit slow because people were just getting there. I have never had this issue before but that specific night my boyfriend and I went it was overwhelming. The BIGGEST complaint I have was I felt security wasn't managing the people who were going in and out on the main dance floor. There was WAY TOO MANY PEOPLE on the dance floor. Literally my boyfriend and I had to push and shove just to get to dance floor. It was way overcrowded on that dance floor. We were getting pushed and shoved, elbowed, and stepped on. I get that people wanna drink, but I feel like there should be a no drink policy on the dance floor. The reason I say this is because people now a days are so disgusting they literally just throw there empty drinks on the floor. I had to kick about 5 empty plastic glasses out of the way. Oh and some people just dance to crazy that their drink tend to spill everywhere and get on people. Last one as well, I suggest as well there should be a no cigarette policy on the dance floor as well. There was an idiot who was super close to me and smoking right next to me, flicking his cigarette all over the place and I felt that he was going to burn me. I am all about safety first and I felt that I was NOT SAFE on the dance floor. I feel that the management team needs to make some changes. I get it, its VEGAS, but I feel like no one should be at risk because security can't manage crowd control. Something to think about Hakkasan Nighclub.

Hits:
* Cool, beautiful crowd... From what I remember
* Great staff -- had a heart-to-heart with the security guard manning the entrance line while waiting for my promoter
* Spacious restaurant\/club with 5 floors -- 3 dedicated to the nightclub: Hip Hop room at floor #3, EDM room floors #4 - 5
* Don't remember this part, but I heard the CO2 effects made the lasers look really cool and blew down directly on the crowd... glad I didn't pass out from it
* Decent drink prices for Vegas nightclubs -- $16 for LC's is much better than EBC's $23 vodka red bulls
* Instant entrance for those with pre-sale tickets -- the boys waited a good 15 minutes for us while we were getting the promoter situation straightened out

Lessons Learned:
* Dance floor too small and the club had too many tables, with too much dead space between the tables -- guess the club is designed to promote booking tables... wish we had $8k to shell out for a table on the dance floor
* No sitting or leaning against the railing! Unless you wanna get yelled at by security 
* There are a million stairs -- wear sexy, but comfy shoes \/ heels

You go to check it out because it's new and some awesome DJ is there, and then you leave when you realize it's not that great. Amazing DJs, but the club itself is an ergonomic fail in design. 

Unless you've bought a VIP table, this club probably isn't for you. Guys that do, you'll have a good time. Girls that don't, not so much. And it's not like most Vegas clubs, where random people meet and start drinking together. The club is not setup for that inviting experience. 

My 4 girlfriends and I went for Tiesto last Friday -- Tiesto was amazing, one of the best sets I've heard from him! .. but we ended up leaving the club before close (which we never do) because of Hakkasan itself. Us girls live for this stuff, and I wish, I wish we could have said something good about it.  

Where it fails:

1) It's missing the experience. 
When you walk through Hakkasan, most people you walk by aren`t smiling - it's weird. The reason for this is that the experience is missing. Everyone in a club should be able to experience the ambience and atmosphere of everyone partying and having a good time. Hakkasan doesn't offer this. Unless you're at a VIP table or are willing to get smothered with sweaty bodies on the waaayyy over packed dancefloor, you will not have an enjoyable clubbing experience because you can't see anything! You can't see the DJ in the main room because of the design layout and you'll be stuck wandering in the paths, or dancing in the overflow area. 

2) You're always looking down because you can't feel comfortable walking around. 
First, there's soo many stairs at random levels. Second, the overflow room has raised platforms that are not visible in crowds. As a result, sooo many girls were taking a tumble because of the poor design\/lack of  area guards and the bouncers didn't do anything about it. It was ridiculous. Third, the floor pattern is misleading; it gives the illusion that there are white steps when there are not. My girls and I kept thinking that there were steps and we felt like we always had to be cautious. 

3) If you're not VIP, you'll feel like a second class citizen. For girls, we're usually used to being treated well at Vegas clubs, but because Hakkasan isn't designed for mingling and meeting new people, girls are left behind... without a view of the DJ (not even on a TV screen anywhere), without a single place to sit, and wandering around aimlessly. The result: they leave. Hakkasan is known for girls leaving -- the staff know it and this is why is it Vegas commuter club.

It doesn't offer us glamorous Vegas nightclub experience and it's really disappointing.  Here's some suggestions to make it better: 

TO THE HAKKASAN OWNERS: 

1) The Overflow Room. This room offers no experience. You have to remember, people come for DJs, so even if they're not in the main danceroom, you need to give them that experience. Add a massive LCD screen showing the DJ playing along the side with the balcony. Also, you can't have girls falling all over the place! Add barriers to the corner areas of the platform for safety. 

2) The Waterfall back area. You need to let girls sit here, otherwise they will leave. I get it, the idea is that people have to pay to sit at a club, but this is just ridiculous. You need to let girls rest their feet sometimes. Marqui allows it in certain areas, and so should you! 

3) Upstairs - small suggestion. If you're not VIP, there is noooo experience up here and therefore, it's a waste of space. Give people the experience. Add some small LCD TVs everywhere, so people can feel the DJ. People will create their own fun in front of the TVs.  

4) Upstairs - big suggestion. Because the openings to the VIP booths are opposite to the DJ stage, the guys in the VIP are facing the DJ stage. Therefore, when girls are walking behind, they'll never get noticed. So, I think another tier that is a few steps lower than the VIP area should be wrapped in front for non-VIPs. This way, the guys in VIP will physically""see"" girls and tell them to join them AND they'll feel more like VIP with more people seeing them. Also, regular people will actually have a view. 

5) Dancefloor. Having 2 entrances on the dancefloor at the ends of the stage is inconvenient for exiting. Add two more paths to enter the dancefloor like Marqui. 

These problems may seem petty, but for Vegas, this is exactly what it's all about. Someone(s) missed the mark here. Hakkasan needs some work, big-time. I won't be back unless something changes.",24,7,5

Yes, the stairs can get annoying but don't get so drunk to where you can't even function and you won't fall on your face ;) The main floor is pretty packed, but we stayed towards the back and found a cool room that had a bunch of VIP tables and you could dance right there next to them. Why pay 5,000+ for a table when you are literally right there anyways? For the ability to sit? Nah, I'll save my thousands for something better :) Tiesto was great there, however it was weird how he didn't even say anything when he came on. Maybe he is so used to it because of the contract?

And it's not because the drinks are expensive or something small like that. It's because I honestly had one of the worst experiences with a club EVER there and it nearly drove me to tears. Here's why:

So a group of friends and I met in Vegas to celebrate my best friend's 21st birthday. Before we got to Vegas I bought three tickets to Hakkasan which cost me close to $200. Then once we were in Vegas, I found a promoter to get the rest of the group in for free. But here's the catch: the promoter said we had to be there by 10:00 pm to get in for free, so that's what we did. Once we got inside we found out that unless you're ordering bottle service or a VIP, there isn't a single place to sit and just drink. And we found out Calvin Harris wasn't coming on till 1 am. So we asked SEVERAL of the people working inside that if we left, could we get back inside? They said there would be a re-entry line but that we would get back in eventually.

When my friends and I returned a few hours later, the people REFUSED to let us back in claiming they ""don't do that at Hakkasan."" After I told them that several people inside had told me it was okay and showed them the very expensive tickets I purchased, they said it was irrelevant and that we should move along. What made me even more pissed off was that as soon as we walked away, I saw the same bouncers let a group of girls back in that had left earlier.

I have NEVER received such poor customer service from an establishment and hope to never step foot near Hakkasan again. So I guess my advice is, if you're ready to spend hundreds of dollars on a table and bottle service, I'm sure this club is decent. But if you're an average person, stay far, far away!",13,3,3

CONS (should be first):
THERE IS NO ""WOW!"" FACTOR HERE. The design layout is poor. 
Stairs? 
Way too dark! Bathroom is even darker. 
(I don't wanna know what this place looks like when the lights go on.)
The sound system was specifically directed towards the center floor. 
Having to look up at the show for 15 minutes per hour. 
Hip hop room was too small and felt like a labyrinth to get through. 
Drinks are way over priced. XS doesn't even charge $16 for a simple drink! Vodka & water. $16??? Really?!?! 
Was too pricey to get in. Paid $100!!! 
$50 to walk in, $50 more to cut the line. Didn't realize that when I was the only guy w\/ 13 other girls. Thankfully the girls chipped in and paid $60 for me. 
I got bored. 

PROS: 
Cool light show if you're on one. 
Major headliners performing
Everyone dresses to the tea since its new right now. I hate seeing ""that guy"" wearing chucks. Really? Wear big bro's clothes!

Hakkasan tops my worst experience EVER (topping my Tao Nightclub birthday experience where it was so packed that people were spilling drinks and getting their clothes stuck on each other because they couldn't move 5inches). This was my third attempt at trying to get in. The first time, the line was outside the casino and the second time we made it all the way to the entrance only to be told it was $10 off the main price for those on the guestlist. 

My friends and I arrived early since we were on the guestlist for a promoter. We waited 3 hours to get to the coat check line, where we were notified it was MANDATORY ($5) to check in your coat. There was a huge discrepancy in regards to who thought a coat with buttons versus zippers qualified a coat check in or not (this applied to girls). We then had to get into another line to get in. When we finally make it in, the place was so packed you couldn't dance or mingle, much less stand any where remotely appropriate that didn't block traffic or get you moved because VIP tables where near by. 

If you want a fun club experience go to Marquee, XS, Tryst (even though it's small). It's too bad they have some awesome headliners for EDM. But they obviously didn't plan out the layout or considered those who aren't purchasing $500+ tables. Spend your money else where.",0,0,1

I feel like they're letting too many people in and it's nothing but a fire hazard if something were to happen. I can't tell you how bruised my toes were from constantly being stepped on because other bodies are literally on top of me. Getting a drink was brutal and exhausting: took me nearly 45 minutes. I ended up getting two drinks and just held both of them because I was never going to make it back over. The drinks were very good, pretty strong... And I wasn't complaining because of the line that I had to wait in. With the constant roped lines to get into the club, they should use the same logic in ordering a drink. Seriously...

Party-goers who downloaded the Nightinerary App received free entry and comped drinks at Hakkasan from 9PM to 10:30PM. This was my first visit to Hakkasan and to my surprise, there was a small crowd in attendance. Plenty of walking space and bubble room! The bar was sponsored by Kettle One and the drinks were tasty. The music playing was kind of weird, more like background noise.  

At 10:30PM, the main club was opened up and attendees were invited to stay and stick around. I took the opportunity to explore and found the layout to be odd. There's too many stairs and random hallways. I later found the hip-hop room, which was dreadfully tiny and playing outdated music. 

I wouldn't describe the club as ""beautiful""...instead it reminded me of a scene from Mortal Combat. I felt like Sub-Zero was going to pop out anytime (the Dragons on the wall and the foliage creeping everywhere prompted this feeling lol). 

DVBBS was launching their residency that night. I left a little after 11:30PM and I think I missed this Canadian duo. I wasn't digging the music the DJ was playing while I was there and the music was playing pretty low anyways. As I left, the lines were getting crazy and more people were pouring in.

My impression of Hakkasan was just okay. I had a way better time at GBDC. I'll probably come back though just to see what's what.

Our husbands\/bfs\/friends had a table but it took what seemed like forever to get in.  They were inside and it was 1:30am or so.  No line, just a mass of people hovering behind the velvet ropes trying to get the attention of the dude with the clipboard.  

A lot of complaints about stairs?  We took the elevator.  No problem.  

I understand it's a thing here, but people asking for Steve Aoki to ""cake me"" was...  quite the sight.  How do you continue clubbing afterwards, smothered in cream?  I guess I'm just old.  I don't see the appeal.  

The raft was pretty cool though, crowd surfing in a raft!  Yeah!

We had a table on the balcony and it was a great view of all the excitement going on down below.  We didn't get crushed by the other club-goers.  

I do have to say though, randoms would walk in and stand next to us even though it was right next to our table.  This space should've been shared with only the bottle service patrons.  A premium was paid for great service by our attractive server, but there wasn't enough security to keep the strangers on the other side.

From here, the visuals can only do so much to keep you entertained especially when there's a crowded dance floor mixed with both a live crowd and others who just stand around. There is music being played from lesser known DJ's until the famous local resident DJ performing that night (Tiesto) hits the stage but its only entertaining assuming you're into the type of music being played. Luckily for myself, I like the Indie\/house music but it got old fast.

If you're tired of this area, the bars move pretty fast so I'd recommend stocking up on drinks and exploring the other floors Hakkasan has to offer. For me and friends, The Ling Ling Club on the third floor of Hakkasan is where the fun was. Lounge areas for those paying for it and a much better variety of music ranging from 90's to current hip-hop and techno. The crowd in this area was a lot more energetic than the crowd on the main floor as well. We stayed here for hours until we tapped out from sore legs and feet.

We were urged to arrive early (11pm) because the lines get pretty hectic when a DJ such as Tiesto is set to perform. Lines did get crazy but be warned on early arrival, you will be waiting a while for a famous DJ to arrive and rock the house if that's your sole purpose for going...which will either prompt you to go exploring and lose your spot on the dance floor or just stand in a corner twiddling your fingers. 

This experience was ok. I'd come back but I'm not in a rush to do so. I feel the main floor should have been a blast in comparison to Hakkasan's secondary and third floors. Especially with tickets being expensive only because Tiesto was performing. The experience I had could have been received from any lounge or bar at a cheaper price or free. However, I still believe the place looked awesome and if anything, that's what you're paying for...the scenery.

Hakkasan is different from other Vegas clubs I have visited in the sense that as I had heard, this club really is all about the famous DJ's.

I was on a guest list to get into the club and was told to arrive between 10pm -12am. It was my own fault to arrive at 11:30pm because the line was LONG. It didn't look like we would actually get into the club, but my group waited anyway.  After a while, we were told to follow one of the club employees. He took us to a line that majority guys and we thought we were definitely not going to get in because a group of all guys does not bode well with nightclubs. Anyway, as we were walking into the second line, someone else in a different group had a jacket on and a bouncer yelled at her because she had her jacket and didn't know she had to check it in. Then he tried to make my group get out of line because he thought we were with her. Even if we were with her, why does an entire group have to get out of line if only one person needs to check in their jacket? The line wasn't going anywhere. Also why did he have to yell at her and everyone else? SO RUDE. Thankfully, a lot of people started leaving and getting out of line so my group was able to get in. Once you get in, it is packed liked sardines, so I can understand why it took so long for people to get into the club, they had to wait and let the crowd filter out, I get it. 

I'm not a huge EDM fan, so to me, I don't think it was worth the wait to stand in what felt like an overcrowded club. I didn't even bother heading to the bar because I figured it would probably take me an hour to get a drink. I got the vibe that if you didn't have a table, you're s.o.l. because you will get shoved and stepped on and will probably not be able to see anything past all the people standing on the tables and dancing. After an hour at the club, I couldn't take it anymore so I left. Finally got in an elevator with another group and one of the guys was saying it took him 30 minutes to find the exit, because he mistook the red EXIT signs as an actual exit instead of an emergency exit. The girl working the elevator rudely interrupted and said that the blue exit signs were regular exists and red meant emergency only. I understand that she just wanted to let him know but she gave him such an attitude. She seemed annoyed that anyone took the elevator at all and just had a glaring look the whole time. 

In all honesty, Hakkasan is just another exclusive club that does not live up to it's hype. Of course, the level of your enjoyment for a clubbing experience should not depend on the venue but on the people you are with. If you absolutely want to come to this club, get on a guest list and get yourself in line before you're told, unless you want to wait in line for a long time.

The only way you can really enjoy yourself is if you reserve a table which of course, is expensive. And that is the only way I would ever come back.

If you do decide to come, the guestlist is crap. So I recommend buying presale tickets instead and arrive before 11:30 because the place gets pack around 12am. 

Since this place is so packed, I suggest staying in one spot the entire night because it can easily be taken if you leave to buy a drink or take a bathroom break. Or have friends save that spot for you. 

If you plan on being on the floor, I recommend being in the front or middle with a group of friends to avoid people going in and out and getting in your way if you stay in the very back. It can be really frustrating the entire night.",5,2,1

Honestly for me, nightclubs are not much different and I think people tend to judge how good the club is with how much fun they had. But fun is too unstable of a variable, what if your friend got too drunk and threw up everywhere and got you guys kicked out?

So with that being said, I had the best time ever whoo hahaha. Lights are cool, confetti everywhere, cool crowd. 

Dance floor on 2nd floor isn't that big but still quite fun, plays EDM. There are tables that wrap around the dance floor. Upstairs, more tables, I'm going to guess they're cheaper than the ones downstairs and not as crowded since there's no dance floor, just tables and a bar.

Didn't get to check out the first floor of the nightclub, which plays hip pop.

Pretty good crowd here, met really cool people, thanks to the big group of guys that got me and my girlfriend super drunk whoo! 

If you're going to get a table, I suggest downstairs because the atmosphere is much better.

I rarely give out ""1 star"" in my Yelp reviews, but I think this situation warranted it.  My friend got us on the guest list for this nightclub, which seems to be all the rage these days in Vegas.  The club promoter who put us on the guest list assured us that we would be able to get in before midnight.  We got to the line at around 10:30pm and proceeded to stand in the line for about 1.5 hours.  Even the guest line was ridiculously long, and no one updated us on how long it might take.  We finally got to a section of the line where the promoters came over to talk to us. It was around midnight at this point and the club promoter told us that the guest list was now closed. It would have been nice know that they were going to close the guest list sometime in the 1.5 hours we were standing in line.  It was all pointless.  The club promoter said that we could still get in if we each paid $50.  And the price for guys to get in was $125.  Um, no thank you.  I can do a lot more with $50 than go to a nightclub in Vegas.  And I've always gotten into the other Vegas night clubs for free.  My friends and I assumed that getting on the guest list a day in advance would ensure that.  But nope, apparently it does not. Some of us ended up leaving and 3 of our friends decided to suck it up and stay.  They had to wait in line for an additional 1.5 hours after we left, so they didn't actually get in until around 1:30am.  They did watch some of Calvin Harris' performance there, but they were only there for about an hour or two.  Definitely not worth the $50 per person!

Glad we got tickets on line because they raised the admission price by $20 at the door. I guess that's pretty common in Vegas so always try to get your tickets in advance.
The one thing that really got me was the friendly staff. I couldn't believe how friendly and helpful everyone was. I didn't even know about the hip hop music in the lounge area or the short lines to certain restrooms.

I may even return for another visit (when I decide to have another club night) just because I know I will always be taken care of here.

The reason this club is around is they book large edm names. We thought it's a weekday and we aren't sure what will be cool, since Steve aoki is playing at hakkasan-why don't we check it out? 

That was not a great plan.  We arrived around 11 and it was an insane amount of people standing around and down another hallway tons of people in line. We bypassed the line-likely because we were all girls. It was still $20. Funny enough this is way less than a cost of a ticket of it were a ticketed event.

The decor is very nice but the main room isn't so unique that I wouldn't think it could be in another city. It certainly seems to be set up for edm sets. Pretty good DJ viewing from all around and fun lights.  

I had a great time the first hour to hour and a half. The crowd was in general pretty attractive and I had zero surprise grind from behind incidents and no creepy guys I had to swat off.  Bravo! I feel like the crowd had pretty good vibes and attitude but that might just had been the people around me. 

If only the club had stayed as it was for the first hour and half it would have been fantastic.  Unfortunately, the door must have kept letting people in because soon enough we felt like we were packed in Tokyo subway during rush hour. Even worse the dense sardine packing wasn't just on the dancefloor but everywhere, near the bar, in the hallways and pathways. Both my friends had cigarettes burn on them, not seemingly because those people are jerks but more because the club was too packed and provided no (at least obvious) smoking\/getting air area. 

If you are an edm fan, wait until the DJ comes somewhere near you since will not be able to enjoy the music with so much smoosh. If you don't like edm I thought XS was a far more beautiful club. 

For management: there is enough of a market to make the events ticketed. I would have gladly paid more ($40-60 is what they charge in DC where I live) to see top talent and have an amazing night.",2,1,0

What if they drop the cigarette or burn other people???

I've read about others getting their cellphones stolen at this club?!! I can imagine why because its so packed. I hope they realize that they need a bigger dance floor.

Tiesto didn't play until 2:30 a.m.  

I'm paying $85 for a ticket.  The least they can do is reserve a spot for people who paid money in advanced. (I am aware that this is a growing trend among clubs...which is total bullshit!!!)

Anyways, got in, realized it was way too crowded (to the point where you are almost touching hands with whoever is next to you), and walked towards the back of the club.  Even though it was a little bit better, these spots were right behind the bottle service tables.  The people who had bottle service stood on their seating area (totally reasonable as they paid for it), making it impossible for anyone near the back to see the main stage.  

Overall, pretty terrible experience as far as how the place was set up.  The sound systems weren't set up well and the sounds were piercing at times.  Visual effects were extremely mediocre. 8oz bottle of water (half of your normal water bottle) was $9.

We ended up booking a room at MGM on Thursday, July 11 to go to Tommy Trash at Hakkasan.  Here are my pros and cons about the club:

Pros:
+ Free admission when we showed up at 1:45 (yay for being girls!)
+ Spacious and lots of room to move
+ Decent sound system
+ Quick, efficient bartenders and cocktail servers
+ Our table was in the middle of the dancefloor so we were able to see everything!
+ Clean bathrooms

Cons:
- Awkward stage setup -- depending on where you were, you weren't really able to see Tommy Trash
- Cheap looking decor
- No special effects, frills, or amazing lighting
- Dress code wasn't enforced -- if I knew there would be girls in maxi dresses and flip flops, I would have probably dressed more down
- Strict ID checks (Mine was looked at up and down for a good minute)
- Long line for elevators

I would probably go back to Hakkasan if a DJ I liked was spinning, but I was definitely underwhelmed with my experience compared to other Vegas nightclubs.  For a place that's hemorrhaging money to bring in the biggest DJs, they could definitely do a lot more to their setup and decor.",8,3,4

A promoter put us on the list here and once we were inside, everything went downhill.  It was impossible to get onto the dance floor because it was so jampacked- this struck me as a serious design flaw for a place where people typically go to... you know... dance?!  We wanted water and paid $12 for a water bottle, which is outrageous but sadly not unusual in a Vegas club, so if that was the only thing wrong with this place I wouldn't complain too much.  I know this spot has different DJ's depending on when you go- but I have to say whoever was playing the night we decided to go to Hakkasan was playing nondescript repetitive untz untz untz music that made my ears want to bleed a little.  And I like untz untz untz music, but hey make it something a girl can dance to.

We located a second dance area that was a bit more manageable, and while we were in dance party mode we actually had a great time.  When we tried to leave, the proverbial crap hit the fan.

The system this club has set up for allowing guests to exit the club is a recipe for disaster.  If this place caught fire people would get trampled and die.  First off, we could not find the exit for good long time.  When we did locate the exit, we joined a herd of human cattle attempting to get into overcrowded elevators to get out.  We figured we might be able to find a staircase to exit and skip the elevator crowd, but the bouncers notified us we could not exit via the staircases and had to wait for the elevator.  We waited for what seemed like an eternity (probably 45 minutes to an hour) for our turn to ride the elevator out of the club.  I turned to my friend while waiting in the line and said ""I feel like I'm in purgatory!  What is this place?!""

When we finally got out, one of my friends burst into tears because this experience was so traumatic.  I truly do not understand how it took longer to get out than it took to get in.

As someone who came out of the rave scene only about a year and a half ago, Hakkasan was always talked about. I went with a group of about eight people and we had table reservations. Our comped table was the closest to the outside walls with super easy access to the dance floor. The host made our drinks, we hung out for a bit, and we danced. I never realized how awful it is dancing to EDM for hours... in heels. Blech. 

CONS:
-The main level is really small. I couldn't believe how small it was. 
-It is jam packed. Even without a headlining DJ and what you would think would be a slow night, they still pack the place. It looked awful to be guest list because they were all packed like sardines all over the place.
-It is wayyyyy too loud. Don't get me wrong, I can handle loud music. I grew up going to rock concerts and shows but, this was just extreme. There's no way you're having a conversation with anyone in this club. Everyone is constantly screaming into each other's ears, no matter how far away you are from the speakers. 
-If you don't keep ordering bottle service, they replace your whole table without any notice. I mean I get it, they're trying to make the most money that night. It's cool. You do you Hakkasan group. However, when we came back from dancing, and random people were at our table it was so awkward. We were confused and we had to get our stuff out of the cubbies under the benches they were sitting on. It probably made the experience a bit weird for the new guests as well. 

PROS:
-The bathrooms were nice. They had employees in the restrooms to assist drunken ladies find the next open stall, offer us towels, and the usual bowl of mints, mouthwash, perfume, etc. 
-The dance floor was a lot of fun. Whenever my group went out to dance, we surprisingly had enough room to make dance circles and made friends while we were at it. The air vents were a big plus. It gets hot in there and I appreciate them providing us with heavy bursts of air.

I echo the sentiments of many other yelpers about this place. Personally, there are far too many reasons to not go that outweigh reasons to go.

I went to Hakkasan on a Saturday night to go see Tiesto. Luckily, I purchased the tickets on Hakkasan's website so my guest and I did have to wait in the enormous line that had formed outside. We were in within 10mins. Online, men pay $30 and women pay $20. That was probably the only positive of the night.

Once inside it didn't take long to realize how poor the layout is. There is a dance floor on the first and second level that are both very small and lead to a ""sardine in a can"" feeling if you dare to venture into that hot mess. My guest and I ended up dancing off to the side because it was literally impossible to force our way in and have a iota of space. 
Even off to the side it was pretty busy. Simply put, they let in way too many people. This may have been due to the fact the this was during NBA summer league and UFC 200 just let out and some of the pro athletes were in there, which may have led to a bigger draw.

I was very excited to see this new club in Vegas when we went for the long weekend (I went memorial day weekend Saturday night) with a few friends. First off, they almost didn't let me in because I bought my ticket off of my friend's sister who couldn't make it. I had the confirmation email with my name on it. The girl checking me in rolled her eyes, stared at me dead in the face and said--with a terrible attitude I might add, all she needed was to move her neck from side to side and I was about to take off my hoops and throw down--""HOW DO I KNOW YOU DIDN'T HACK INTO THAT EMAIL TO GET INTO THE CLUB""

UMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM BIATCH please. I'm sorry to break it to you honey, but your club ain't important enough for me to be learnin how to hack into people's email just for a fuckin $40 ticket okay. BETCH IT AIN'T DAT SERRRIOUS.

So I went and complained to another girl who finally let me in. Then when they started checking IDs, they wouldn't let one of my friends in because they said he didn't look like his ID. The guy is almost 30! We asked 5 other securities if he looked like him (including cops by the way) and they all said he just looked darker in the picture. When my friends tried to reason with them, they just turned around, COMPLETELY ignored them, and started talking to eachother.

WHO RAISED YOU BOY!?!? Show some respect! 

You know, we get drunk, and we can get drunk ANYWHERE. We can see that DJ ANYWHERE. The only thing that separates one club from another, is the atmosphere and the service so F**** THIS CLUB.

All employees were helping us and they were friendly and curtesy. Bartenders were working very fast!  
The night club has round shape. I believe it has 4 levels, and all levels has 2 full bars.  Lots of seating areas, booths with tables. You can make reservation for seating and bottle service.
The dance floor is huge!
The lights and lighting system is truly state of the art! 
There are lots of stairs everywhere and almost impossible to see them in the dark. So please be careful! 
Also, for convenience,they have elevators in the club. 
Restrooms are located on the second floor! 

If you are planning to attend any of the famous djs nights, make sure you arrive early! The line to get in the club, is HUGE! Plan ahead! It is good to know some host\/hostess for faster services!",5,2,4

""Megan"" (if that's her real name) told me I was not on the guestlist.  The problem is she just kept scrolling through the guestlist on her ipad without carefully looking for my name.  At that point I got the hint. She did not want to honor the guestlist but wanted me to go into the general admission line to pay.  She was dismissive of me.  But I realize it may not be just her. So I'm gonna go ahead and point the finger at management too.  

After wasting all that time in the guestlist line, I decided to just get into the general admission line to pay my $50 to get in. Maybe the experience in here will turn things around.

I get in and I am not that impressed. Looks typical.

1) XS
2) Lights
3) Surrender
4) Marquee

Sadly enough it's based on customer service\/service and value. I've seen the ABSURDLY expensive bottle list packages that have been circulating on the internet (i'll upload a picture) that they seem to be proud of. The cheapest one starting at $12,000 on up to $500,000!! A half million dollars for 4 hours of impressing your friends, co-workers, and Vegas hotties with how wasteful you can be. The second thing I'm rating them on is service. I showed up to check out this hot new club with a group of 11 friends, 7 girls, 4 guys. First they required a $10,000 bottle service to let us in, then after over an hour of waiting they and it was getting closer to 1 am, they came down to just cover at $150 per guy + $50 per girl, + $300 to the door guys to pass the line. Sad thing is we could have easily afforded the $10k table if we wanted, but the way they treated us and demanded it of us and acted as though we were a waste of their time. We ended up grabbing a huge limo and hitting another great club on the strip. 

I was really looking forward to checking this club out and now I could care less. One of my friends is even the General Manager and when he answered his cell, he said got no time & no tables then hung up on me. I guess I'm not A list famous enough to warrant their time.

Some nights were fun but most were ok.  When both Light and Hakkasan were opening up this spring, I could tell that there was a huge buzz around Hakkasan.  It was going to be THE place to be!  I was super excited but then sadly disappointed by a few things... 

1) It is difficult to see the DJ unless you want to be sardined on the dance floor or if you have a table... actually some of the less expensive tables are pretty far from the DJ and can't see either.
2) The crowd is a little bit pretentious for me or people who go there like to act that way because they are in Hakkasan.  I got a similar vibe at Marquee.  At other clubs I feel a little more relaxed (ie. Surrender, Light, even XS). 
3) The layout and stairs are killer for heels.  The stairs from the hip hop room feel never ending.  The physical location of the club is on the opposite side of the hotel from the parking lot also!  It's almost like you need to bring a separate pair of sandals for the walk to Hakkasan... parking lot, then stores, then across the casino.

I don't hate Hakkasan, don't get me wrong.  Here is what I like about it.
1) Hakkasan is definitely a fancy club.  When guys have to pay, they might feel like they are getting more for their money with a ticket to Hakkasan because it is such a big club.  Tickets are expensive though for guys... it can get up to $75 depending on who is playing :\/
2) Huge DJs!  Tiesto, Calvin Harris, and Hardwell to name a few.   I most recently saw Nervo there a few weeks ago.  We waved at them from the dance floor and Liv waved back to us!  So cool.  This is where the superstar DJs play for sure.
3) The staff (bouncers, security guards, etc) are all realllly nice!  I think that Hakkasan did a great job training their staff :)

I definitely have to pick and choose my nights at Hakkasan.  I usually go for a certain DJ or if my friends from CA are going to Hakkasan.  I don't think my feet or heels can survive too many visits in a row haha.",6,2,3

Based off of pictures that my bachelorettes took, the lights looked incredible. 

The drinks were outrageously expensive. It is Vegas but two soda vodkas and two water bottles added up to $66. I guess that's the true price of free entry for girls. 

Two rooms played different music. I wish I knew that. I missed the first 5-10 minutes of Porter's set until one of my girls suggested ""He might be playing upstairs.""

No other options were given except paying full price even though we spend $$$ at the restaurant. Super rude and no budge or customer service at all.

The lines were disorganized and all over the place.   Though it's not hard to get in, you just have to know how to get in.

LADIES: wear comfy heels.   After walking across the whole casino, finding the right line, standing in line, then stair mastering your way up in heels.

You'll last 45min-1.5 hours MAX on your feet.

Once in, and climbing more stairs than I do on a stair master, within the first 5 minutes, on the dance floor, a guy pushed his D up my rear, I looked to see who, but I can't tell who I should mad dog amongst the sausage fest of men.  I turn around to face my friends, then my butt got squeezed.   I turn around, but I still can't tell who's the pig.

Hakkasan is smart.    They'll let you in and and the conditions of the club will spit you right out.   

With horrible conditions (seems like there would be a serious code violation from the INABILITY TO MOVE in case of a danger), I don't see why anyone would stay more than 45min-1hr AND even if you wanted to stay, your feet are tired.

The lights, the sounds, the confetti, and puffs of cool smoke made it fun for the time being.

Everywhere else was JAM PACKED, you could barely squeeze your way through, and if you had to tinkle, well good luck. Prices are $$$ as expected, being the new it spot of sin city. 

Why I give Hakkasan the 4 stars:
Security guys were awesome, they looked like they actually enjoyed being there. I mean let's face it, most security at clubs look miserable. They're so easy going. the 3 guy bartenders were chill as well, friendly and efficient..

LOOOOOOVED THE DJ at the hip hop room, i'm normally one of those girls that have songs i KNOW i want to hear, but i didn't for once have the need to feel like i should go (drunk) request a song. He played ALLLLLLLLLL the jams.. from old school Biggie and Jay-Z to Pharrell and Daft Punk.

So there you have it! No lines at the bar, and great hip hop = EPIC NIGHT!",9,4,5

My experience started off fun but once the nightclub became crowded around 12:30 it was hard to move around and many fire and safety codes were being violated. They let too many people in. Besides this error in management the VIP waitresses shove you if you are near the VIP tables, and when you tell them to not touch you they get in your face and tell you to F**k off. Then the bouncers jump in and act like you are the instigator. Overall will not be back and if you have any problems with moving around call the Las Vegas Fire Marshal and he will shut down the club and it will cost them $40,000.  (702) 455-7311",0,0,1

Its a place where you can reserve ULTRA-EXPENSIVE tables, and watch tons of people crowd their way around your table for a free spot to dance, which won't be found. The focus of this club is TABLE RESERVATIONS. Every spot that they could place a table, they did. So there are no great spots to dance because there's a table there, and of course, a corded off area for their table guests to dance, but not for you. Do not go unless you can afford a table reservation. There is no point. Want to see that DJ? Go to Wet Republic to see the DJ, at least you can dance there.

There are a couple of nice things (hence 2 stars):
The lighting is amazing in the main room (which you won't be able to see because it will be too damn crowded). The sound system is amazing (which you won't be able to enjoy because you are constantly getting stepped on by the person next to you and the large group of people that thinks they see a spot to stand at the far back of the dance floor so they have to squish through the impossibly tight crowd).",6,1,0

But the venue itself with the lights and screen, dancers, DJ booth, the tables are amazing. I went the next night and got a table for Laidback Luke, Amaris and Arthur were my handlers and the service was SO GREAT! Later in the evening our table got upgraded to a bigger and closer table to Laidback Luke for no additional charge. It was the best 30th birthday I could ask for. Do realize that there is a 40% mandatory gratuity. Expensive but the place and service is worth it if you want to do big. Still pretty good place to just go to without a table as well.

We pregamed it over at Centifuge which is next to the club (highly recommended! It's too expensive once inside the club). We purchased our tickets online so we just went to the presale line and were like 7th in line! They scanned our tickets from our phones, and then checked IDs. The guy who checked my ID made me smile because in my picture I have no glasses and long hair and now have glasses and medium length hair. Mind you my ID says corrective lenses but okay...luckily once I smiled he was like whatever and stamped my wrist. They let us in at about 10:45 (club officially opens at 10:30 on Sunday's) and were actually one of the first people in the club, so I got a good look at the club itself! You take the elevator to the main level and they let you off. Walk in and there is the DJ in the center surrounded by a dance floor and smaller booth VIP areas. It's honestly a beautiful club, and I was in awe. The DJ there looked like a fake Calvin Harris (wish it was but he is doing a show elsewhere at the moment), and played amazing tracks! They had the air blowers, confetti, and crazy lights. We were towards the front, and the people were pretty fun until about 1am! The crowds got worse and the bouncers literally blocked you in so you can only exit through the sides. Many people had pregamed too and got super thrashed. People starting buying drinks there which we avoided because they were so little, and so expensive! It's about $25 for a small shot glass sized mixed drink. Not worth it! Unless you're doing bottle service, avoid it! Bottle service ranges about $1k all the way up to $10k I believe and it depends on promotors and where you sit. Not really worth it either because unless you stand on a table you can't see. We had to go to the bathroom as well as wanted to check out the rest of the club so the only way to walk through was VIP tables on the sides. It was me and my best friend and literally so many people trying to stop us to get wasted with them. I got stopped by maybe what was a pimp...he's like join our table! I just kept walking. We finally made it to the bathroom and they have attendants in there who try to sell you flats for $25 with credit card (no debit, even though you can run a debit card as credit), and $20 in cash! They are the cheap fold up flats that usually cost about $10 from a 711 or party store, so bring your own (they don't check bags in for a coat check) or ask if they have other options! They have cheap sandals for a few bucks tip! We couldn't make it to the hip hop room, cause we couldn't find it, so we went upstairs, a side lounge that was strictly VIP with more tables, and were on the main level. 
The main reason why I'm leaving this review at 4 stars was because the bouncers! They are the least bit helpful and should've thrown the thrashed people out of just managed the crowd better. And by thrashed I mean people falling over and those looking so gone they about to puke. They actually let those people in the club like that which is a no no. It's usually okay if they get thrashed at the club, but actually allowing people in like that is crazy. These people didn't really show up until about 1am, and Above and Beyond still hadn't come on. Because it got so wild, we left by 1:30am. The bouncers weren't able to really direct us if we had a question on where something was. They just said keep moving! They also fenced us in with the ropes on the main floor so that was a pain. They were nicer when you enter the club, but inside so rude. 
We stayed for a while, and it was such a blast!!! But I recommend getting their super early! Great music overall! Would love to see Calvin Harris there honestly, and will stick it out for that!",3,0,1

Came here Grand Opening night with Deadmau5 headlining.  Bought tickets ahead of time so was in a shorter line...waited maybe 5-10 min.  

With all the competition, I have to admit that Hakkasan doesn't even measure up to Marquee, XS or Surrender.  I was so curious and hopeful that Hakkasan would be another great club.  Not this time. 

Negatives:
-There was no re-entry like all the other clubs offer
-There was no tapwater at the bars
-No outdoor patio area 
-The layout was too enclosed and there were too many sets of stairs
-Dancefloor in the Ling Ling Room was quite small
-The crowd as a whole isn't as attractive as the crowds at XS\/Marquee
-Another Asian themed club in terms of decor.  There was nothing innovative, nothing new, nothing to really talk about

It really was dissapointing that there wasn't an outdoor area.  I mean come on!  I think that's one of the best parts of XS, Surrender and Marquee.  With the warm weather coming around, the option to hang out outside would have been a considerate addition.  

Sadly, there's nothing special about Hakkasan.  The only good thing about it is that they have good DJ residencies but really, don't waste your time or money coming here.",27,5,6

In order to get to the club you have to go up multiple sets of stairs (this is difficult when you are wearing heels). From what I understand there is a lounge on one floor and a club on another. The actual venue is on the highest floor. Don't make the mistake we did and stop on the wrong floor waiting for the artist. While we waited we decided to get a drink... The prices are ridiculous !! 35$ for two vodka\/sprites. That's almost 18 $ a drink! The venue is a nightmare if you are actually trying to see the artist.

We came here with a group of 9 girls for a bachelorette party.  We were on the VIP party list and when you approach this line, it is ridiculous.  There is no organization whatsoever to talk to the host.  It's really depends whether you can squeeze through the crowd or not to talk to the host.  I can see how a lot of arguments could occur in this situation.  After waiting for 30 minutes, our club promoter came to get us.  We enter an elevator to get to the club.

The ambiance and decor is really nice here.  The main dance floor gets really crowded.  If there was more room, i think we would have had a lot of fun.  I loved that they had the confetti drop.  It felt like new years for a minute.  There was also dollar bills flying down towards me.  I don't know if this is a normal thing for this club or we had some ballin' celebrity that decided to throw dollar bills into the crowd.  It was pretty fun trying to get the dollas! We came away with a whopping $5 that went towards the tip of our drinks lol.  Most of the music played on the this dancefloor is EDM.  

This place has alot of stairs so make sure you wear somewhat comfy shoes girls!. Their hip hop room though on the other hand is pretty cool.  I just only wished it was bigger.  It's super crowded down there on the dance floor.  I only wished we had some room to dance.  We ended up dancing on a box but to be drunk and dance up there that long, it's kind of scary.

Vegas and Nighclub are inseparable and to complete our trip we had to go to one of the posh clubs. We paid 50$ for the advance entry into the club to enjoy Hardwell on Labor day weekend. Even after paying the hefty fee, the wait line was long. we reached at the end of the line and informed by the guards that one of our friend cannot enter the club because he was wearing sports shoes. Luckily, he agreed to get us after we came back. But the club layout is very weird and there was hardly any space to stand let alone dance. the club was full of tables but since we couldn't afford one we had to make do with the floor. 

The starting DJ was not very impressive and we could barely stand on the lower level. It was super hard to move and people were bumping into each other trying to pass for the entrance. We decided to move to upper level and wait till 2 am (that's when Hardwell was supposed to come) and found little space near the stairs on the side of the stage but we were constantly being harassed by the servers to move away and people trying to clean floor in every 10 mins.

You cant get to the dance floor because of human traffic jams, if you make it to the dancfloor it is just a mosh pit of people squeezed together so tight that your privates are touching each other and if one person moves then the entire crowd moves in waves.

First and foremost, is it really necessary to have stairs everywhere? Even those little 2 steps that go from the bar to a table, like why couldn't you just have a little ramp there? You know you have a problem when there is security there just for the sake of flashing their lights on those stairs so people don't trip and fall on their faces. 

Also, security is another thing. I know it's standard to have guards flashing their lights on people drinking but I really do NOT appreciate looking at the end of the flashlight every 5 mins. There are times where I would literally just be standing in one spot for about 20 min with a drink in my hand (I was taking a break from dancing) and there would be a security guard, shining his flashing light in my freakin' face at least 3 times, even though I haven't moved or anything. I was just standing there trying to enjoy my music and my drank while resting my feet. Geez.  

The dance floor is small AF. I don't even bother trying to dance on the actual floor itself but instead, opt out on dancing by the tables closer to the bar. Oh yeah, you pretty much need to get a table if you want to enjoy yourself and have even the slightest chance to breathe in this place. This place gets so freaking packed you can't move an inch unless you have a table to chill at, if you're willing to sell an arm and leg to afford one. And even then, there are those bottle rats that take up all the space at and on top of the tables too. Eff that. 

The only plus sides of Hakksucks is the djs and the fact that one of my friends' bfs works here so I got walked in last weekend (I busted a mission after work and got to the club at 11pm). But even then, I left pretty early cuz Tiesto was just playing all mainstream edm and I wanted to hear his old songs. Womp womp. Save your time (and money guys) and go to Light instead. You'll have a way better time, trust me.",8,4,3

First off $18 for a vodka with sprite just sucks. Not only do you pay to get in the doors but then you have to pay a hefty price for every drink. I got 2 drinks and 2 shots and paid nearly $80. If you're going to come here, drink up before you walk in the doors. And don't expect friendly service. It just doesn't exist here. 

Next... the security. Just awful. I went to the bathroom and got stopped on my way out by security. Apparently because there was a white residue on the floor of the stall that I had used. Yep! Trust me, I was in absolute shock. I have never in my life touched drugs and I think people who do them are absolute fools. Yet somehow security decided to accuse me of it. I have no doubt that trashy girls go to clubs, snort drugs and god knows what else when on a night out in Vegas but I'm not that type of girl and it infuriated me that I was accused of it and kicked out. Never have I ever been kicked out of a club. The whole incident was a mess. They were very unprofessional, rude and cruel. I even allowed them to search my purse to prove my innocence and yet they continued to be jerks. I even spoke with an actual police officer outside of the club and he even told me that I didn't seem like the type of girl to do drugs and that I wasn't even intoxicated and he even apologized for how the security officers treated me. 

Avoid this place. Security act like they're entitled and treat people with no respect or courtesy. Why spend a lot of money on a place that treats you like crap? There's plenty of other nightclubs in Vegas to go to. Try Surrender or Drai's the music is better there anyways.",8,3,1

Hakkasan gets 5 stars this time around. Wow. Came here for the Thursday of their Anniversary Weekend and Tiesto was playing. The club is the most beautiful on the strip-I even like it just a bit more than Omnia, and that is due to the bartenders and overall service, which, after reading other reviews I'm shocked people have had such negative experiences. 

Got here around 11 to check out the talent, (so many beautiful women here looking to have a good time) establish rapport with whoever would be handling my tab, and to get a prime spot on the dance floor to see Tiesto. Stephanie was a great bartender-courteous as ever and took care of my group all night. Bouncers were friendly. I personally hate waiting in lines and will say that even the guest list and bottle service lines was ridiculously long for a Thursday. If you have a ticket they literally whisk you inside-just my opinion, but highly recommend buying one really early to avoid the ticket prices going up during the same week.

I have an idea as to why this club has gotten horrible reviews, but can tell you from my experience, it couldn't be further from the truth. Honestly, all of these reviews are probably the best thing to happen to Hakkasan in order to weed out all of the fake EDM clubbing people that only want to go to a club just for the sake of being in this city. Just to give you an example: I went to XS the next night to see Guetta (XS has a way better Yelp rating) SUCH a different vibe and was well below Hakkasan in terms of the venue, dance floor, beautiful people, and value, as well as for all of the pros I just discussed. In reality, if you're a huge EDM fan like me, you don't even need a table to have an amazing night here. Highly recommend this place for a fun group!",2,0,2

Subject: Hakkasan: Pursuit of Hapiness

Dear gatekeeper to my happiness, 

I was visiting Las Vegas for the Labor Day weekend, and came to your club Hakkasan on Saturday night to see one of my favorite DJ's, Calvin Harris. 

My excitement was soon tarnished by the misfortune of being targeted in what appeared to be a series of professional iPhone thefts (don't worry I followed Fergie's wisdom, ""Big Girls Don't Cry""). Around 12:30am, I realized the zippers on my purse had all been masterfully unzipped without my noticing. I have luckily managed to travel through some of most dangerous pick pocket areas in the world (looking at you, Barcelona) without ever having a theft before, so I know that I was not simply being careless. This craft was so ingeniously perfected that I wouldn't doubt the theft ring includes Calvin, with the thieves planning to target people when Calvin says to the audience, ""Put your hands up!"". (Just kidding Calvin, let's be friends). 

Luckily, I'm a very ""what goes around, comes around"" type of person and was able to enjoy the rest of the night to the best of my abilities (minus the creep that decided face-touching was appropriate stranger behavior). After all, this situation was not life or death, and the kind thief managed to leave my ID so I could still get into clubs the next days. I thought that was very thoughtful of him\/her! I also am not one of the many people trashing your club on Yelp for this disaster. Everyone deserves a fair chance to make recompense, right? That's me putting good Karma vibes your way. 

Everyone I spoke with (Las Vegas Police and your nice bouncer staff) on the way out of the club informed me of your contact details so that I could share my story, and hope that your desire for good Karma would be enough to help compensate me for the situation. 

My contact details are below and I am looking forward to hearing from you soon, friend. 

Kind regards,

P.S. Buying a phone out out of contract is a buzz kill, right?",16,15,1

The club itself is nice and everything, but it's Vegas, it's supposed to be over the top nice, so that alone doesn't win me over. I'll be there for Hardwell during EDC week, so maybe I'll update my review afterwords. 

First thing that is horrible is the dance floor is TINY. It's literally about the size of an average non Vegas club, but they're packing in Vegas numbers. Prices were expensive as well, most I've paid in any bar outside of LIV in Miami, including all of the other big Vegas clubs. The overall design of the place just seems like a massive failure IMO. 

I didn't wait at all in line to get in with my presale, and all of the staff was super helpful, so that's great change from the douche vibe you get from the staff at Marquee. 

Truth be told, without their summer residencies, this place would fail. If they can keep signing big talent, then it will continue to pull people in. Light has them beat in everything else though, and I expect big things there if they can reach out and grab a bit more talent.",3,0,0

I worked with a VIP host to get a reservation for a table for 10 people (5 couples).  He told me to arrive early, we did, he said to speak with one of his fellow hosts to get in, we did.  What ensued, was the worst experience I have ever endured at a club.

The area outside the club was a veritable zoo.  No clear lines, no clear signage of where to check in if you only had tickets, if you had nothing, and if you had a table.  I went to the side to speak with someone and he said he could not help me, but I needed to speak to the host.  It took me at least 45 min to get his attention (Greg I think). We spoke VERY briefly and I mentioned that we have a reservation for a table for 10 and he asked what our spend was. I told him it was $2k and he said to give him a minute.  He waled away for at least 30 minutes.  I grabbed him once again and asked what we need to do to get in. He said get in the other ""line"" which was more like an ocean of people. I asked if there was any other way and he hinted that it would take some greasing of his palm.  I collected what I thought was acceptable ($80) and offered it to him.  He looked down and asked, ""what's that?"" I said it was $80, he walked away.

From there, I finally decided to bite the bullet and get in the ""line"".  After another hour or so of madness and watching others get in randomly, we decided to leave and go to XS.  What I learned from this experience, makes me pretty sick.  First, nothing is guaranteed, no matter how much money you are planning on spending. Two, if you plan on going to this club, be prepared to pay an extra $300-$500 to bribe the host to get you in.  Now, I am all for tipping, but when you are about to spend thousands of dollars at a table to have fun for a night, there should be no need to add a bribe to that.  

I don't care if I sound naive or cheap, but that is complete BS.  People come to Vegas from all over the country and the world to experience Vegas nightlife.  If this is the norm, someone should at least tell the future guests that the only way to get in is to grease some palms with multiple Benjamins.

Lastly, to clear up any questions, they were not even letting in groups of smoking hot women.  I am at a loss.

Upon arrival, there were numerous security and bouncers, helping organized the many lines to get in the club. They let in the pre-sale ticket line first, right at 9:30PM when the club opened. Once we went through a few stops with checking IDs and tickets, we were sent on our way to the dance floors. The first two story is held off for the restaurant that wasn't opened yet. The third floor is the hip hop dance floor, thus reserving the fourth and fifth floors to the main stage, EDM (electric dance music). The stairs were difficult, especially for girls in heels. They reserved the elevators for people with table reservations.

I was blown away by how absolutely stunning the main dance floor was! It had 4 LED panel walls that was the focal point of the entire space. There were a total of 4 bars and more tables than I could count. The entire staff was so friendly and helpful. Everyone greeted us with a smile and answered any question we had. We had more than one staff member offered to take our group pictures for us. Honestly, best staff of any club I've been to. It even rivals some of the hotel staff I've encountered on the strip.

Calvin Harris was the featured DJ that night. He had Fergie opened and closed for him, and he only played for 1.5 hours from 1:30-3am. Tiesto also made a quick appearance, and did spin some songs. After paying what we did, I wished Calvin Harris played a longer set. While he was playing, he was distracted by all the commotion going on behind his DJ table. There were models, and lots of men in suits (investors I'm sure) that he had to mingle with. At one point during his set, he was making out with a model instead of spinning. It was probably the excitement of Grand Opening weekend, but it wasn't a good set by him.

There were some high points and low points. Overall, gorgeous, top notch club with great service. However, crowd needs to be more diverse (80% Asians) and the DJ sets needs to be better. They charge $9 for a small Fiji water which I thought was ridiculous. No outside area is a huge letdown too.

Perhaps it was the night we had picked (Saturday night + Tiesto's birthday bash), but the line was INSANE. Once inside, I felt like we were getting gassed from all the cigarette smoke. I had forgotten that since smoking is allowed in the casinos, it's probably allowed inside the nightclubs too.

I personally like XS a lot more because of the open area, especially for a non-smoker like myself cos it could get really stuffy and smoky in a close area like Hakkasan.

Bought tickets day of for $30 \/ guy while girls got in with a guest list.  The three of us showed up at around 10:30 and promptly got into the club.  Granted, at 10:30 it's literally only guys.  Seemed kind of sad at the time.. the DJ's doing his thing but the dance floor is empty.

This was the second time I've been to Hakkasan, and I didn't much like it the first time, mostly because there's no outdoor area in this club.  This past weekend however, that was exactly what I was looking for, after deadmau5 at XS.  The outdoor areas at XS during summer are ridiculously hot... so that pushed me towards Hakkasan personally.  If it's gonna be crowded and suffocating, at least let there be some A\/C.

Anyway the whole thing turned out to be a lot of fun.  Though all the drops sounded similar, W&W turned out to be a pleasant surprise (much like Sultan and Ned Shepard were, if you read my other reviews.  Yelp is turning out to be a vegas blog for me..)

Didn't have to pay for a single drink (which I still feel pretty guilty about), so I can't comment on the price.  One thing I will say about Hakkasan though is that the girls they have dancing on the sides really make the experience a lot more fun.  No, not the ones with the crazy lights all over their bodies (those are cool too) but the ones I'm sure they put there next to the DJs at those tables.  Every single one of them was attractive, and there were no guys at those tables.

First off, the wait was incredibly long and strenuous. My group and I got in through a promoter who had a comped table. But the Hakassan people overbooked tables that night, so we ended up not getting a table after an hour wait. Once inside, I felt as if there was nothing special about the club. The dance floor was too crowded for life. You were constantly being pushed against another person and tiesto had not even come on yet. In fact, I left before Tiesto came on because it was too crowded, the drinks were not good and too expensive ($18 for a vodka red bull), and it just really didn't seem worth it in the end. Lastly, like every other review mentioned, there are way too many stairs. I thought Marquee was bad. I definitely will not come back to this club in the future.

Came here with 3 other people. Supposedly we were put on the guest list by someone who works there. We were outside waiting for two hours in so many different lines it was ridiculous. They told us to go to the guest list line then by the time we got to the front (which took over an hour) they told us we're not on that list... Then we get sent to the ""host guest list"" but after talking to at least three different workers we find out it's the same line that we were in. Then we were sent to another long ass line. We wanted to asked the girls working at the front if our names were on there just to make sure it's the correct line before we wait another hour to get in and they said ""you have to wait in line for us to check"" with SO MUCH ATTITUDE. But we did get in that line for another 30 min and it ended up not being the right line of course. After complaining to a bunch of people on the VIP side, this guy was so annoyed with us that he just let us in...

Okay, now that we're inside the club... Don't expect to find anyone in there. It's jammed packed. At one point, we were stuck in one section (by the cabana looking tables on the right when you enter) - they didn't let people go towards the entrance or towards the opposite side. So I asked one of the workers where we CAN go so he said up to the second and third floor. But of course it was the VIP sections...

LONG STORY SHORT: for how big\/popular this club is, they really need to be more organized. None of the employees seem to know anything, or at least they didn't know the same things so we were misled every time we had a question. And why do people like this place anyway... They obviously let in WAY too many people. Isn't it a safety hazard...?",3,0,2

Being a Vegas local has its perks when visiting a nightclub is right around the corner! My promoter Dustyn always takes care of my group when I request for a table. He's always provides excellent customer service! The VIP reservations line gets crowded but my group and I never had to wait more than 20 min to get in. The way we were escorted to our table was very professional and fast. The waitress and staff are friendly and accommodating when it came down to bottle service. It includes a bottle of Absolut Vodka with the mixers (Cranberry juice, Orange juice & Soda Water). 

The club itself does get packed almost every weekend which is why I try to avoid the dance floor as much as possible. It is normal that Hakkasan gets crazy crowded before or during the time the DJ is playing.

The first night I was with a group of girls and one guy, we wanted to make sure we got in so we purchased tickets a week in advance, the pre-sold ticket line moved a little faster than the general admission, and when we got closer to the top all the girls were guided one way while the guy we were with was put in a slower line (unless you have the money to pay for tables and bottle service it can be really annoying to be a guy in Vegas). We got chatting to a really nice woman working security and she managed to pull him out of his line and into ours (which was so lucky because we never would have found him inside). 
Calvin Harris was playing and the music was amazing. We spent the entire night on the dancefloor, lost some of our group because it was so busy but we all had a great night. 

The second time we went it was just the girls and we were on the guestlist. We arrived a little late and we were looking for the guestlist line (there are so many different lines). As we walked by the line for tables we started chatting with a group of really nice (not sleazy) guys and were invited to join their table. I have no idea how much they were spending but the table we had was one of the best in the place, so I imagine a lot! The hostess we had was gorgeous and really sweet (all the hostesses here seem to be the best in Vegas, they are all so hot and really nice). 

If you do have an insane amount of money to spend then the tables are the way to go, but even without one you will have a great time. I can't wait to go back!

Will keep this somewhat short\/sweet.  Pros\/Cons are probably the same as everyone else that didn't love it.  I'm shocked that anyone gave it 4 or 5 stars, especially since they really had nothing incredible to say.  

PROS:
- Calvin Harris on 6\/8.
- I used the elevator.  I really don't understand all of the complaints about stairs.  
- People were genuinely nice.  Table minimums that night started at $6K, so the guys at tables had to buy ridiculous amounts of alcohol to meet it.  At those minimums, everyone was very happy to share since that buys you a LOT of booze.
- That's all.  Seriously.  Sooooooo underimpressed.  

CONS:
- This is an ugly venue.  Seriously.  When you have clubs out there like XS, Tryst, Surrender that are visually gorgeous and have outdoor areas (Steve Wynn, you are an effing genius), why would you create a boring, giant box of a nightclub?  Atmosphere is terrible, and it looks like it's been there forever.  Nothing modern about it.  The creators should honestly be embarrassed.  Also, lots of little ramps\/ledges throughout.  Terrible (and unsafe!) for girls in 5 inch heels.  Watch your step ladies.
- Promoters and staff at the door are awful.  As a girl, I've never had to wait.  Or pay.  At Marquee, XS, or any of the premium clubs.  By 10pm, the so called guest list line was out the door.  We didn't need to pay cover, and moved through the line at a decent clip for awhile, but reached classic ""at capacity"" 3 or 4 groups ahead of us.  For well over 30+ minutes.  We heard one of the girls in the group at the front ask how much longer the wait would be with no attitude.  The bouncer's first reply was ""Most people would kill to be standing where you are.""  Not cool dude.  Your attitude, in addition to your greasy ponytail, needs a makeover.
- Water situation - it really is nonexistent.  We managed to get a barback to sneak us some tap water while we were at the bar doing a round of shots.  Bartender was really nice, but didn't budge on the no water policy.  I highly doubt that they are counting on making profits as a result of water sales, so this is just bad service.

I cannot believe that they are positioning this as the hot new spot and that it's working so far.  If they didn't have the DJs that they have this year, this club would be a flop.  XS and Marquee are still much better options.  Don't waste your time on this one.  Go somewhere with a beautiful atmosphere that still brings in awesome talent.",6,3,0

Nothing here impressed me. Not the crowd. Not the music. Not the DJ. Sure, each individual song was nice on the night of 10\/17. But the transition between songs was sh*t.

The alcohol is ridiculously expensive. And if I come back, I will be sure to get a table.

I don't understand designers thinking sometimes. Hakkasan in the MGM has so much going for it. They are the hot new club on the strip, they have incredible resident DJ's, and people want to go there. But what they have done is ignored normal party goers and catered to the wealthy that will spend big bucks on a table. 

I'm not joking if you don't have big $$$ don't waste your time. The entire 4th floor is basically tables for VIP. For us normal folk they funnel you to the dance floor through ONE staircase that is used to enter and exit the dance floor. Good luck getting on or off once it fills up. Took me 5 minutes pushing and shoving (politely I might add) to move 20 feet. The dance floor itself feels like it is a 6 by 6 box that they try to jam 500 people on to, there is just no space for anyone. Dancing is non existent as you just try to stay upright in the hoards of people. Then, once you think you have room enough to maybe move a bit to the beat someone pushes past, and the shoving match ensues again. Also we heard that theft is an issue here, because people are jammed in so tight it would be tough to notice someone grabbing your wallet or phone. Someone next to us had their phone stolen. Needless to say before my wife and I got the chance to see Hardwell we left. 

I feel like this club really missed the mark. You can only survive on being the hit Club so long. But this club is built for a minority of people willing to spend thousands on tables not those of us willing to shell out hundreds just to stand, there is no where to sit and rest your feet BTW. And don't think you can stand anywhere outside the main floor and see the DJ as there are no such places. Non that they let you stand in anyway, they have people that will tell you to move if you try. Won't be long before they have people out on the street begging you to come in here. 

Oh and they wanted to charge me $23 for a Red Bull and vodka. I laughed and walked away as I value my money a bit more than that.  

It's a shame because it really is a beautiful club, really nicely built and awesome lights but there is just no room. Big missed opportunity.

This is a review on the main dance floor on the 4th level (Hardwell, Tiesto, Calvin Harris) so don't let this review dissuade you from going and trying something else there.  

UPDATE: Hakkasan to their credit contacted me and asked me to come back and try the club again. I declined as I don't feel a return trip will bring a different experience for me unless the layout has changed. Plus we live in Utah. I'd like to say we found the staff we interacted with to be mostly friendly other than the bouncers.",13,2,3

1.  A billion stair-steps everywhere.  I had fun watching drunk girls trip and fall all over the place.  TROLOLOLOL, loads of laughter.  Someone is going to fall and die and they will get sued and eventually shut down.  You would think being built by Asians, this place would have better engineered walk-ways and lighted staircases, but NOPE.  Instead they hire a bouncer to hold a flashlight to shine each and every staircase.  Kids, this is why you go to college.

2.  Do we really need an Asian themed club?  AS IF THERE AREN""T ENOUGH ASIANS IN VEGAS CLUBS.  Yeah I said it, I'm Asian too, UMAD?  Can we have some diversity?  This way, we won't scare all the White girls and Hispanic girls, you know, the ones actually capable of flirting and talking to strangers instead of the circle jerk AZNs.

3.  No outside patio!!  Some times I just want to connect with a smart girl and stare at her big, beautiful eyes, and tell her my awesome stories instead of just getting bumped by Rotunda and have armpit sweat slapped on my face.  Can't beat XS' outdoor patio.

4.  They don't give out tap water!  The bottle water is 9$!  I didn't come here to drink and get stupid, I came here to flirt, and being the stingy Asian that I am, I think 9$ for water is a really bad deal.  My six pack requires a lot of babysitting and no thanks alcohol.  Asian girls: don't ask me to buy you a drink or if I have a table... especially those of you coming from LA.  It makes you sound really classless and ghetto.  You're not a princess and you're not entitled to free things.  Mommy spoiled you too much.

I showed the guy at the door my ID which I should mention is of me about 4 years ago before I colored my hair.  I'm also from hawaii so obviously they questioned it because of the horrible superbad movie ID. The first guy asked me for another form of ID and all I had was my debit card, but I told him that I had my school and state ID in my room. After handing my ID to about 4 different guys they decided to ask me questions. They asked when my birthday was, what year I graduated from high school, how old I was when I graduated from high school, and my address.  Obviously I answered every question correctly...because it really was me.  Then they handed me my ID and said ""we can't help you"". I spent so much money to come to vegas for my 21st birthday and this was such a disappointment.  I spent so much money staying at the MGM with drinking eating and gambling, how could I not get in.

Before the night my friends and I were walking along The Strip, when a promoter approached us and asked us if wanted to see DJ Fergie that night!
We said yes! It's so awesome how among The Strip there is always multiple promoters promoting events. 

Because of this we did not pay a cover.

Well, we get to the MGM it's a bit of a process to get inside. You first have to get in a line where they will ask you if you are on a guest list once they confirm that you are they will give you a ticket. Then you will get to a different line where they will take that ticket. Once you get through that line you will go through security. 

When we got inside you will go through an elevator to get to the club. It is true that there is five floors but those 5 floors are just five different floors where you can dance to the same music. 
I think that is great that there is five different spaces to dance because the first floor get's extremely packed!
The first floor is very fun because everybody is pretty pumped for a Sunday!
The only downside is that it does get so packed that there is not enough room to dance.

First, the lines. We came at around 11 and spent exactly two hours standing in the ""expedited line for guest lists"". People started to sit on the floor, ladies took off their shoes, etc - it was a pitiful picture. Prison-level humiliation and total incompetence of security. We've noticed that some people gave bribes to the guard at the entrance to sneak in faster. It was like in movies - he quickly glanced around and reached for the money like some kind of a beginner gangster every time he did it. 
When we finally got in, first thing was the stairs and the darkness. The legs hurt like hell after two hours spent in the line, and now you need to climb those stairs... As many other clubs, it's built around the dj booth, with VIP tables making a ring around it. Either you're inside the ring, standing like a pack of sardines, can't move but too afraid to leave because there's no chance you'll get back there, or you're outside, behind the VIP tables, in total darkness, standing next to bored and disappointed people from the VIP tables. 
To be clear - nobody dances. The overcrowded inner circle of people can only slightly move up and down on their feet and wave their hands with smartphone shooting pictures of the dj, to brag at home. 
The rest of the people - both from the tables and beyond them just stand and look. 
Everybody looks at the dj as if it was the messiah. Noone looks at each other. This was the weirdest atmosphere I ever experienced - people dress up in their best, but end up only looking at the dj. Frankly most of the crowd wasn't much to look at anyway - there's no face\/attire control. At all. 
Smoking is another plague of this place. People smoking cigarettes and weed as if it was some cheap bar in some God forgotten country in eastern Europe. Could hardly breath. Any self-respecting place in any other part of America doesn't allow smoking within 20 feet from the door to the club. The smell was terrible and even if I liked to hang around and jump with one fist in the air, facing the dj like Hitler Yougent, I would probably not last long because of it. 
The music was just your standard, underwhelming EDM. The dj's role is clearly overhyped. 
Periodically there was smoke and confetti bursting from the ceiling. But with the overall pitiful and pathetic ambience of the club it only added to the general boredom. 
We left after about 10 minutes and saw many others who entered at the same time we did also leaving.

The stairs are a bit annoying, but there are elevator ladies! Bottles? Is it necessary? Yes and no. It depends where you get it. If you get it in the main floor (in the back area), it looks a bit lonely if you don't have many people around you. I recommend bottles near the DJ or the hip hop room.

Always buy your pre-sales beforehand and the line moves by so easily. I had no trouble with the bouncers or getting in.

We went in June the weekend that tiesto was playing. I went with a group of 8 girls. My promoter hooked us up and we all got in for free with the guest list. Most people I know had to pay $50 at the door. So yay we had more money for drinks. 

We got 8 shots which came out to $145 which was quiet pricey but we didn't complain because we all got in for free. We first went down stairs to the hip-hop room which was pretty average size not too big. It kind of started getting crowded so we went to the main stage where Tiesto was about to play. We got there so early so we started drinking and getting out buzz on.

The main stage was huge but Tiesto was only coming on at 1 which was quiet late we expected him to go up earlier. And when he actually show up it was way passed 1. I was kinda mad because half of the girls were super tired and wanted to leave.

** Biggest down fall about this place is the amount of stairs they have. Its really not a good idea to have so many stairs in a club especially when people are drunk they would trip and get hurt. I would be extra careful just because we girls all wear such high heels. Its definitely not the safest club out there.

First off let me say that we came here about a year ago and we had a great time. Fast forward to this weekend and this place has really gone down hill.

We went when Calvin Harris was dj'ing and he was amazing ...100%. However I would say save your money and go see him at a different venue. Marquee is amazing and high class.

What made it a horrible experience? The club was jam-packed and there was zero crowd control. Most clubs are crowded and jam-packed with people but this was to a different level. It was difficult to walk around, but then on the ramps and close to the stage it was impossible to walk or walk away. We were completely trapped. First a woman started yelling at the security trying to control the crowd and when the security got in her face someone in her party threw a punch and a fight began. 

Because of the fight the security guard pushed through and made a little area to walk ...we walked the opposite way and walked down a ramp but only until we were stuck again. No way out and nowhere to go. We stood jammed right next to the stage. My legs were literally touching the platform to the tables that surround the main dance floor. Although you couldn't dance we had no where else to go but to stand there. The worst part was when everyone started pushing so bad that I was getting crushed into the stage. My legs were getting jammed and my body kept being pushed over. 

I asked the security guard to please help me and escort us to the exit. He said no the way out is that way...and he pointed to the massive crowd that was pushing me...ridiculous. There was no one there making a walkway or helping control the crowd. I am 100% sure there are fire code violations happening at this club. I asked him for his name and he said ""you don't need my name"" so I grabbed my phone and was going to take a picture of him. He grabbed my phone and pushed my hand down so that I couldn't take a picture. Disgusting...who does that?! My husband who at this time was about 4 people away from me...this was how bad the crowd pushing was...told him to not touch me. He then proceeded to smile at the picture and then again hide his face. When I put the phone away he said what do you want me to do I am doing the job of 5 people here?! More validation that even the security doesn't feel like they are equipped to do their job.

Finally about 10 security guards\/employees came out and I was sooooo very happy. I thought hey! They are going to control the crowd here. One of them who came out must have been the supervisor of the guy I took a picture of because he called him over and started to point at me. I waved and was so happy thinking I was going to get some help. NOPE! They were all there to get a cake across to a VIP table. They didn't control the crowd at all or care about the safety of anyone there. 10 security guards\/employees for one cake but 1 for the swarm of people. Again disgusting.

We walked right behind one of the security guards following the cake because it was the only way we were able to get through the pushing crowd. They were yelling at me not to follow but I was worried about my safety and walked through to get out of there. 

We finally got away from the crowd and were able to listen to Calvin. I was so incredibly disappointed at the experience though. I go to concerts and night clubs all the time and although there are swarms of people there is also crowd control. 

Overall if you want to get almost trampled and have your safety put second to the club's bottom line go ahead and go here. If you want a better experience I say go to a better club that is managed properly...there are plenty of other options in vegas.

I hope the fire and safety department really take a look at what is happening here so that there are no accidents.",7,1,0

Both times that I went I had presale tickets. Guestlist lines are loooongggggggg and if I knew I already want to see a specific dj, I will buy tickets and avoid standing in that long line when I'm drunk off my ass.

My first time here was to see Steve Aoki. We got there pretty early (11pm). The line was actually not that long for presales but they kept holding us up and not let us in! When asked why, they said it was because the fire marshals are inside checking up on some safety issues and the line will move once everything's clear. The second time around, we arrived at midnight and there was only 4 people in front of us in the presale line. We didn't get in until 1am. When asked why, the security told us the owner of Hakkasan is inside and the line will move as he leaves. Sounds familiar much?

The venue seems big only because of the different levels it has but honestly, the dance floor is TINY. I've been to clubs with bigger dance floors in LA! You're definitely gonna get all these sweaty guys slobbering up against you as you try to make your way onto the dance floor. The crowd? Old, rich geezers or high college students. Not so classy. While waiting in line, I had several people rolling and trying to talk to me.

The only pro thing this club has going on is that they house some top djs. I saw Steve Aoki here the first time and he killed it with his performance. He was crowd rafting and throwing cakes! The second time around I saw NERVO & Calvin Harris who were both amazing. I probably would not be back at this club unless there's a dj that I am dying to see here.",2,2,2

I've been in clubs where I felt like a sardine in a can, but it was beyond that. It felt like a mob with a purpose--to get on the dance floor. It's going to sound dramatic, but I literally felt like my life was in danger at some point. Picture Black Friday at Walmart, that lady who got trampled over, I thought that was going to be my fate. My friend paid for my admission, but 60 bucks for female and 100 bucks for male, to be trampled over. Biggest rip off in Las Vegas. No bueno!",6,2,1

We were a group of three girls and were asked to sign up to be on their guest list for the Calvin Harris show on June 18 2016. We went and got there kinda early. Then the trouble started in the line. One of us was pulled to the side Bc ""you're ID is questionable"" she was asked to sign her name three times and to print three times. When she graduated high school and how she was when she graduated... We are well old enough to go clubbing\/ drinking. Eventually we were allowed inside. Once inside it was mainly set up for VIP, the rest of us peasants are forced to stand the entire time we are there. And don't think about sitting or leaning on the ledges. Again, the asshole staff forces you off. We didn't even bother getting drinks Bc the bar staff couldn't stop talking about the $5,000 tip they just received. After about 45 mins of this unpleasant torture we decided to leave Bc Calvin Harris wasn't coming on till 1:30am and we couldn't endure 2 more hours of this garbage. 

Good thing** the bathroom attendant had fast flats for sale which saved my life that night. But they were $20 :\/",0,0,0

The service is excellent. The sound is great. The layout is inconvenient because of the elevator. The DJs are always awesome. I highly recommend getting a table. It's super VIP and you can see everything. They definitely have the best waitresses in Las Vegas. I always recommend coming here or XS - the only other club that compares. It's expensive. If you are cloister phobic do not come here! It gets unbelievably slammed and really hard to walk and move. If you want more space and fresh air go to XS.,0,0,0

I would give them 0 stars but they get one star because we got in free and did not have to wait in line. They need to set a maximum capacity or something. It was so crowded I started to feel anxious because I literally could not move, dance or breath. Imagine if something horrible happened we would be trampled on, stuck and their dinky elevators will not get us out on time. Yes I was literally thinking about that at the club! We were stuck going down to the dance floor and it took us forever to leave the dance floor as well. Luckily we went downstairs to the hip hop area (Ling ling?) which was less crowded and had a blast. I don't think I will be back to hakkasan if I don't need to! Not worth it!",2,0,0
