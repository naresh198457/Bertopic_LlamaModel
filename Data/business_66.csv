The Aria is such a pretty hotel with other nice places to hang out and eat and this was just less than what I expected. I should've taken my 30something bucks and just gone back to the spa and brought a pastry from Jean Phillipe with me.
I was underwhelmed - the spread is not exciting at lunch. I guess I expected something new, special. This hotel buffet could have been in Vegas 5 years ago, and this hotel just opened last year.
The saving graces for me were three things: the fried rice - that was very good and not drenched in soy sauce or greasy; the cooked to order pasta bar, which was delicious; and the dessert table which was pretty and I had two creme brulee.

Yikes! At that price, you kind of feel like you really have to eat a ton to get your money's worth. 

I will say the seafood selection was abundant, including both King and snow crab legs, several types of fish and shellfish, and dishes like pallella. 

Everything I tried was very good, and our server, Louis, worked harder than I've ever seen a buffet server work. 

At $50 a person, I might try a few other places before coming back - but if we were in the mood for seafood, we'd probably come back here. 

Tip: if you're seeing the show at Aria, it's literally immediately next door so it's very convenient to eat here before a show.",2,0,0

Price: kinda expensive ($74 for 2)
Waitress\/server: RUDE as all hell! Now, I suppose I wouldn't have been overly concerned with her jacked up attitude if she was that way with everyone but she absolutely wasn't. The white couple next to us got the pleasant voice and got checked on frequently...we were kind of left there like the red headed step-children. I am a firm believer of tipping ones wait staff (I usually drop 20% b\/c I know these people work hard and that's how I show my gratitude) but she all the way killed it as soon as she opened her mouth. She had ample time while we were eating to redeem herself but she threw herself under the bus when she was only nice to one table and not the other. 
Food: literally half of what we ate was really good, the other half horrible. We made a point to try everything to get our $74 worth lol! The cheeses in the Italiano section were ok, the mozzarella kinda melted and that made it taste weird. The roast beef seemed extra bloody. There was an open faced pork bun that tasted like sea water it was so damn salty. Pesto, Mexican section, seafood soup, seafood jambalaya, sushi, salad, beef brisket, mashed potatoes, both gravy's, banana in some butter sweet syrup, Rice Krispie treats, and ice cream were on point. Everything else was over seasoned somehow including the king crab. Meringue cookies tasted gross along with the coconut macaroons and the flan was somehow bland tasting. 
Manager: the manager stopped by our table and asked how everything was for us, we took that opportunity to let him know we were displeased with our server. He apologized for the experience and told us he would take this feedback and use it as a training tool. He was a very nice guy and I appreciate that he was checking up on folks and checking out the food area. 
He seemed diligent about his work, I can respect that. Sure enough as soon as he leaves, our server gives us the friendly voice and asked how we were doing...yea be nice in our last 5 minutes lady, sounds like a great idea =P 
Cleanliness: my spoon was dirty...turn off in my book. The table was a bit sticky as well when we were seated. 
Overall: the hotel area and the casino are very beautiful and full of abstract art pieces. As for the buffet, we won't be coming back...or taking people here; just a bit expensive for the quality of the food. I just hope my pregnant ass doesn't get some kind of stomach bacteria from the mozzerella being out in room temp for a long period of time. The little seafood cups should have been on ice as well but they weren't.",2,1,1

So we jump between Carnival World Buffet at the Rio and Bacchanal at Caesar's. But then we discovered The Buffet at Aria and just like that, we found our new favorite place to eat.

We went for brunch the day after Thanksgiving so there was no line, a BIG plus. It's still a new place and it's separated enough from the casino that the cigarette smoke doesn't reach you (a bigger plus for those of us who hate the constant cloud). The restaurant is beautiful and airy with attention to the tiniest detail, even the cups they serve juice in.

FOOD FOOD FOOD. There was a good selection and most of it was pretty high quality if you avoid the ""Asia"" section. They keep their supplies fresh and well stocked and I enjoyed watching a chef make pancakes as big as car tires. My boyfriend could not get over how good the breakfast items were. I personally am not a big dessert fan but had several helpings of cake and pie. Not too sweet and just the right size to allow you to try all their selections.

The waitress we had was super nice even though she was busy and she made the effort to swing around and check up on us when she had the chance so good service too.

They give you sub par lobster but its still lobster... 

I am Korean and the kimchi was actually really good.  So kudos for authentic sour kimchi!

Not so redeeming qualities: 

Service was horrific no fault to our waiter... he worked his ass off but he was covering a large area by himself...

I came here to try their Sunday ""Gourmet"" Brunch.  Its 32.95+ tax but the it was a huge disappointment!  In Short, don't waste your money to come here.

The line was non existent when I came.  I felt it was not a good sign.  The foods were quite mediocre.  They have alot cutbacks for their brunch.  King Crabs are gone, snow crabs instead (Like Wynn).  FYI, King Crab only available on weekend dinner so I have been told. The quality of the crab is....crap.  Soggy and soft.  Lack of flavors.

Rest of the foods were non remarkable.  The presentations weren't good so did the taste of food.   Dry steaks, dry salads. Horrible Asian stations and their Italian station didn't look too good either.

Their desserts are one of their best tasting station to save this review from having 1* only.  I like their cheese cakes and apple pie but rest of them are just ...blah.

The buffet at Aria does come with a serving of lobster and bottomless wine (between chardonnay or merlot). Yes, the Vegas drunkenness continues through dinner! Anyway, we came right around 4pm which was the start time for their gourmet dinner and there wasn't really a line. Didn't really fill up until about 6pm. Yes, I ate for over two hours and I'm damn proud of it.

The lobster seemed overcooked and tough. It was too dry which made it pretty tough to chew. Oh well. Not bad still. Prime rib was amazing. Perfectly executed.. Great outer layer of spice and nice and bloody...just how I like it. There was also a lamb roast that was also really great. It was really tender and had just the right amount seasoning on it. Crab legs were fine. Very fresh and easy to pick off its shell. The lemons suck though. You'd be lucky to get 5 drops out of them (I need my lemons!). They also had Indian dishes like Tandoori chicken and various curries, but I didn't really try it. Pizza and pasta bar, etc. etc. Nothing special. Not too many other options. 

Dessert was okay. They didn't have creme brulee :( The gelato was nice. Mixed berry was my fave. Banana creme was probably the best cake there. Other than that, nothing else worth mentioning for the dessert.

Service was decent. I think our original server was pretty good at checking in for taking plates off our table and refilling our wine. The whole plates thing got annoying though because I wanted a plate to keep my crab shells on there. Oh well. Lastly, I think after her shift was done, the person who replaced her didn't really check in with us. I guess I just ate for too long and they got tired of us lol

Overall, I'd probably still choose Bellagio over Aria. More options, better desserts, and better lemons lol. If I do come back to Aria, I'd make sure to ask my server if they could give more servings of lobster!",1,2,1

When I ate there last Sunday night, the baked salmon entree was delicious. Could-have-been-served-to-you-in-an-actual-ARIA-restaurant-and-you-would-have-been-happy delicious. I was also happy to fill up on a tasty multi-colored beet salad, still-snappy green beans, and various other practically-healthy vegetable dishes.

I thought the desserts could have been better: the sugar free panna cotta was lacking, at the very least, sugar, and the cannolis, though properly made with lemon and without chocolate chips, needed more ricotta and less unidentifiable whipped ricotta substitute.

He of the highly unrefined palate (i.e., my other half) disagreed: he was absolutely delighted with his rice crispy treats and caramel corn.

The ""big buffets"" (caesars, cosmopolitan etc) outshine this one, even the MGM is better in my opinion. However, it's not slop and it's vegas AND it's a buffet, so three stars seems sufficient. Plus, I love Aria. So beautiful.",1,1,1

It's a bit pricier than what I wanted to pay for breakfast ($23 + tip), but if you're hungry enough in the morning, it can be worth it.  They have virtually every breakfast item you can think of (omelette station, corned beef hash, eggs benedict, yogurt, fruit, crepes, etc.)  But what was surprising is that they also had food normally associated with lunch\/dinner.  They had decent-sized crab legs and the largest, peeled boiled shrimp I've seen!",1,1,1

We enjoyed the Sunday Gala dinner. Although the price is high but there is a great selection! Freshly prepared pasta dishes, Sushi and a selection of meat. Moreover, there are delicious dessert.The staff was attentive and friendly. I definitely recommend the buffet!",0,0,0

Such a pretty, pretty, empty place. A mega casino brunch buffet more than $30 with no line to get in is a sign to stay away.
We were kindly treated to Saturday brunch by our new South Bay elite friend on yelp Spring Break. 5 stars for him and his generosity. No one could have predicated that this elegant looking buffet would be this bad. 
We took a fly over to see take in the variety...or lack thereof. Nothing adventurous, exotic, luxurious. Meat, eggs, pastries, corn beef hash. I was thinking that since Aria costs as much as the Bellagio buffet, that it would be comparable as in terms of fancy foods. Nope. Aria's unadventurous variety is on par with the Circus Circus Buffet.  
The food was basic in terms of preparation There was not one wow dish. Our friend had an omelette. Eggs are a test of a chef's technique. Will the egg be bright yellow, or burned and browned? The egg was brown....severely overcooked. 
Service was impersonal and not friendly. They were kind of like robots. We opted in for the $6 bottomless bloody mary's. The drinks were clearly printed on our receipt that was placed on the table for our server. After we came back from our first trek for food, we had no drinks. Our server had to ask us what we wanted. Let us unlock the mystery....Bloody Marys?
For this $32 price point ,the Aria has to provide more in terms of variety, technique, quality, and service. The one saving grace from 1 star is the fancy architecture and decor and we were treated by our new friend. 
I am a buffet aficionado and I know I will not be coming back here. Save your $32 brunch buffets for Bellagio, Wynn, and M Resort.",5,4,4

Some of the featured items are;

Fish Market - LOVED the unlimited crab. Certainly a favorite with my fam.
Asian - They had a really tasty chicken and broccoli dish I tried.
Italian -didn't try their Made-to-Order Pasta section but glad they had the option.
Pizza - Gluten free pizza dough available!
Mediterranean - The hummus in this section was basic  nothing really fancy. 
Tandoori -Naan was decent
and a host of other stations I didn't try like Latin ,Carvery,and a Diner section with burgers. 

I did like the breakfast items such as the hash browns. I did find a hair in my food so that wasn't appealing. 

They are sort of expensive especially during the holidays. Regularly brunch is $29.99 but during the holidays its $34.99 and they don't even offer any holiday-ish items....

The line is always pretty long unless you have a pass from the hotel (basically I wouldn't consider it worth standing in the regular line, with how long it generally looks...), and it's really not very cheap. The service is pretty nice, though. The waiters and waitresses are pretty attentive with refilling drinks, which is nice. Drinks like soda are included in the price, and the price of alcohol isn't too bad. 

Walking into the buffet, the first thing that's noticeable is the decor - it's a stunning room, with a gorgeous view of the pool. Plenty of natural light comes in during the day, and you can still see outside at night. It's a really lovely view, especially if you're seated by the window. 

The food isn't bad, but it's ""quantity over quality"" for sure. Most things are good, with a few exceptions that are great. Very few of the options I've tried have every really been bad, necessarily, just not amazing. Unfortunately very little of the lunch\/dinner foods are really exceptional. One of the great features is the variety. The buffet sets up different stations, including Asian, Mediterranean, Indian, Italian, seafood, and traditional American fare. There are areas with cheeses and olives and meats, and you can find sushi and crab legs and all sorts of other things. Basically if you try one food and don't like it, there's bound to be something else you'll enjoy. It's a great chance to try some new things, and it makes for a fun meal if you've got adventurous tastes. 

On one of our trips we were there for Christmas, and the buffet had a special where they offered a lobster with the meal for a small added fee. That was definitely a mistake - it was very dry and chewy, and not even worth the small amount extra. 

Where the buffet shines is in the fact that the desserts are absolutely fantastic. My one regret every time I've gone is that it would be ridiculous to try everything, so my friend and I got in the habit of getting different ones and sharing so that we could try as much as possible. They're beautifully presented, with decorated plates, cute dishes, and stunning designs, and they always taste absolutely wonderful. They also have gelato options. The sweets are definitely on par with the other bakeries and dessert shops in the building.",2,0,0

The prime rib was also very good!

You got your standard omelette line, fresh fruit, oatmeal, scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, French toast, pancakes, etc.  All that good stuff.  Nothing really stood out for me, EXCEPT for the desserts.

The DESSERTS are another topic.  All their desserts come from Jean Philippe (downstairs), so you know it's got to be good.  The Oreo cream cake, and the raspberry cheesecake are delish!  They also have the gelato out during breakfast, which made me happy :)

We were told about the brunch by a good friend so we thought that we'd wait until Sunday before we left to indulge. We had checked out brunch pricing on Friday but didn't realize that there was such a significant price difference between Fridays brunch and Sunday's.  I am willing to pay a good amount for bottomless mimosas, but the bottomless mimosas were only $6 each.  Two brunch buffets $72?  Wow, shame on me for paying that.  What I will say is that we made sure to get our monies worth of that buffet and those mimosas!
The buffet was well stocked but nothing too irresistible.  They had a little of everything... an omelet bar (a brunch staple), pancakes, waffles and French toast, all the eggs, bacon and sausage one could ask for.  The buffet had a salad bar, a little Mexican food, a little Chinese food, some sushi, and a touch of Italian.  The dessert bar was adorned with beautiful confections and various types of gelato.  The real star of the show were the crab legs.  Mounded high like fresh picked corn at a farmer's market, the crab was plentiful.  Served with drawn butter and lemon wedges, it was chilled and delicious.  The only thing lacking... a little crab fork.
Our plates were cleared quickly and our server was friendly and generous with the mimosa refills.  We ate our weight in crab legs and drank as many mimosas as we could put away.  A solid 3 1\/2 stars is what I'd give the buffet.  I may be back some day!",5,3,4

like most vegas buffets, they had an assortment of cuisines, but nothing really stood out...they had king crab legs, prime rib, steak, turkey and sushi stations...sure it SOUNDS good, but don't let your eyes and ears trick you...everything tasted a little off, i feel like nothing was fresh! and i would DEFINITELY avoid the sushi and i'm pretty sure the shrimp was the thaw and serve kind...also, each person get's HALF a lobster with their meal...but again, didn't taste that fresh and they don't clean them very well so it wasn't a very appetizing presentation...and when i mean not clean them very well, lobster poo was still all up in there...i know for some folks out there, they just eat that sh*t up, but for me, no thanks because seriously, do you serve kobe beef with a side of poo, no!

so overall review, either their food had been sitting out for awhile, or it was thaw and serve...blech blech blech...i mean, for it to be in the ARIA hotel and have TROPICANA quality buffet, i would totally skip

desserts were AWFUL...the selection was limited and again, nothing tasted quite right...i would go with the creme brulee, i mean seriously, you have to be tastebudless to get that classic dessert wrong

not to sound like a lush, but the only saving grace is the fact they had unlimited wine included in the $35...i'm sure it's boxed wine, but compared to the tasteless slop they were serving, the wine tasted like rainbows

This is probably my least favorite buffet on the strip :( After tax and tip, dinner was $47.99. Please just go eat at Wicked Spoon for this price.

While I love the Aria, their buffet is rather mediocre and generic compared to other places on the strip. For a Sunday night, the only ""fancy"" offerings were:

Prime rib
Cornish game hen
Crab legs and stone crab legs - very overcooked :(
Unpeeled shrimp with feet on
Mussels

I'm restaurant and bar industry myself, and I guess the part that confuses me is how nothing was fresh. Everything had a sauce had a thick film or skin on top of it, no matter how much product they are moving during dinner service. I get that places that do mass production have to cook food way ahead of time, but nothing tasted fresh on a busy Sunday night, and ingredient quality is very pedestrian. You can definitely see the difference in food quality between here and Bacchanal. 

If you're a drinker, they've got a great $10 bottomless drinks deal, so that might be worth your time. Definitely make a reservation if you end up here; you don't want to end up waiting in line for an hour.",5,1,3

The first thing I didn't like about the buffet was that even though they list menu items on a touch-screen outside the restaurant, the list is not a clear reflection of what they serve that day. We were drawn in by the promise of dumplings, shumai, and other dim sum goodies, but when we went in, all they had were veggie dumplings, sesame balls and pork baos. I struggled with the sesame ball because even though they were bite-sized, they were really tough. 

Another interesting station was their noodle bar which allows you to do your own noodle combination of pho, ramen or soba noodles. I got excited because a bowl of tonkatsu ramen sounded like it would hit the spot. But it didn't. The lady behind the counter misheard me and gave me soba noodles instead. The broth was really salty. The pork pieces were decent, but I've had better. There was just a lot of flavor missing besides salt. My fiance went back to get noodles but this time with the proper ramen noodles and it wasn't bad, but we were still disappointed with the salty broth which we fixed a bit ourselves by adding water to it. 

The bad items: taquitos, empanadas, veggie dumpling

The good items: beef sliders, naan and the dips in the Greek\/Mediterranean section.

There's definitely a variety at this buffet, but I've had better. For example, last year I went to Wicked Spoon and even though the food wasn't that great, it was still better than the food at The Buffet at ARIA.",4,1,1

After reading these reviews I was surprised to have the nicest waitress.  She was so kind and constantly checked up on us to make sure we had enough champagne.  She was such a sweetheart.  I wish I knew her name.  The champagne was good, and one friend got the bloody Mary and she seemed to enjoy it.

The food selection was much better than I thought it would be.  To start off they had crab legs, which I didn't think they would for a Friday brunch.  They were a good size and very delicious.  They also had bagels made to order where you could get smoked salmon along with some other spreads.  They had a carving station that had ham and brisket.  Some of my favorite dishes were the lentil curry, carrot ginger soup, pad tai, and spicy shrimp cups.  The desert selection was also very nice.  I'm not much of a dessert person but they had lots of gelato, cookies, bananas foster, cakes, and anything you could think of.  I was really happy with their ethnic food selection as well.  

Overall I would definitely returns because of the reasonable price, great service, and quality of food.",3,0,1

Seafood section: crab legs were good (snow crab) hot or cold. Had peel and eat shrimp, mussels, clams, fish, fish tacos. Nothing exciting. Sushi was Chinese buffet quality.

Chinese food section: Golden Corral quality. I was excited to try it but underwhelmed. It appeared that they had condiments for Pho out, but I could never figure out the station as I never saw any Pho or a person manning that station. Maybe just for dinner?

They had a good cheese selection and salad bar, but I don't eat salad at buffets.

Carving station had roast beef, sausage, pork belly, chicken...maybe a few other things. I tried the beef and it was good.

Indian station- no.

Mexican station- average Tex-Mex.

Tons of desserts. Nothing spectacular but not disappointing either.

We mostly went for the unlimited wine (chardonnay or merlot) and lobster. No line at 5PM and our party of 11 was seated right away. We were also made to go back to the line and pay a separate 18% gratuity charge when they realized we were all in the same group. Sure, we are served wine, and we probably would have left something anyway, but a forced gratuity for a BUFFET is just ridiculous in principle. That meant we had no intention to leave anything else. 

Our waiter, who turned out to be awesome, started by bringing small carafes of whatever wine we wanted. He ended up bringing 4 or 4 at a time and just leaving them on the table. You definitely won't go thirsty here. 

The food was not as much of a selection as most other buffets I've been to. Not many desserts and they weren't as good as other buffets. The rest of the food consisted of carved meats (including salmon), sushi, crab legs, peeled shrimp, some Asian stir fries, salad, pasta, and a few others. Nothing was spectacular enough for me to want to go back for more, and they seemed to be missing most of the basics. The crab legs were pre-cut in half, which I liked (I'm lazy). 

Each person got 1\/2 a lobster, which I really enjoyed. If you like lobster, crab legs, shrimp, and as much wine as your heart desires, this is the place to you. But the other food left us all disappointed for what we paid and for the expectations of this hotel.",4,0,0

That said, when I go to  relatively new buffet at a premium hotel like Aria, I have certain expecations.  They are:
1) Clean and organized
2) better quality ingredients and preparation.
3) good service from the staff.
4) Variety

Sadly, the Aria buffet falls short on 3 of the 4 characteristics.  
1) To begin, Aria is clean and organized although it uses the space poorly.  The food is categorized by food type with a round seafood section and wall hugging American, Italian and Asian sections. The Asian Section and Seafood are the focus of this buffet with several dim sum options in Asian and multiple types of mussels, both raw and drowned in broth or sauce.  

2) I was very disappointed with the food quality and preparation.  The crab legs were tinier than those at asian buffets and not really worth the effort.  The muscles were varied and good and were actually the highlight but the cooked muscles were drowned in sauce and did not taste like they were properly cleaned.  The carving station had a lot of options including game hen, prime rib, flat iron steak and sausages however the prime rib was bland and the flat iron steak dried out from the heat lamps. The game hen was actually the best of the meats as the leg and thigh were most and well seasoned.   The shrimp were small, probably 41-50 count and did not taste very fresh.  There was only a small sample of very basic sushi.  The baked fish was overcooked and unpalatable.   The charcuterie was a poor comparison to Bacchanal as it contained only three types of meats to go with dry crumbly cheeses.  The meats were tough and fatty and definitely not premium quality.  I couldn't even sample the mac and cheese which was a liquid mess with the oil separating from the cheese.  The buttermilk mashed potatoes were ok.  Deserts were very good and possibly saved the evening but the gelato bar did not get adventurous in flavors.

3) The staff took forever to take my drink order, clear my plate, and refill my drink. I was able to get up, get a second plate and return and eat half the second plate before the first plate was removed.  my tea was never refilled.

4)  Very disappointing variety.  First, they bill the buffet as ""a new way to buffet"" but there is nothing new about it.  I was excited to see so many steam bins for the asian section but turned out they were doubled up and just americanized favorites such as dumplings, pork buns, shumai and the best of the bunch, the leek pancake.  They were not well cooked either.  Other than the dim sum, there were very few asian options. The fried rice was highly disappointing   The Italian section was also disappointing as it contained only pizza and spaghetti and meatballs. Other than the meatballs, which were nothing special, you could have had a better meal at Cici's.  The seafood section was great if you like muscles but lacking everywhere else.  I didn't expect 500 items but I did expect something to set it apart which I didn't find.",7,4,2

I showed up at 3:30PM the day after it opened on purpose to be able to sample their lunch and their dinner dishes.  The cost was $21.99 per person and included the usual drink offerings of soda, iced and\/or hot tea, coffee, and juices.

The first action station you see is a skimpy, made-to-order salad bar where any one of three+ servers place a small variety of incredients into a mixing bowl, add the dressing for you, and place it on a plate or bowl.  It's a neat idea to have a salad action station, but this one falls short.  Do they really need to portion out romaine and shredded carrots? I asked myself.

Moving along the line, you begin to see real food, including 3 carving stations, one with turkey, one with leg of lamb, and one with prime rib--all were of acceptable quality and well seasoned.

BEWARE THE SUSHI:  the sushi was terrible!  It's essentially of the same caliber as what you would get from a low-end local supermarket and they go way to heavy on the rice and the fish is barely visible, dull and dry instead of shinny and moist..  Skip the sushi!

BEWARE THE ASIAN DISHES:  They also have about half a dozen Asian dishes laid out, including Chinese brocolli with beef in hoisin sauce, orange chicken, noodles with veggies, egg rolls, etc.  First the hoisin sauce, which might as well be called hoisin salt at this buffet becuase it was way too salty and not well stirred.  I would avoid it unless you like to have your soy sauce in a shot-glass.  The eggrolls had way too much dough and not enough veggies, and they were under-cooked.  The noodles were overcooked and the flavor was uneven from one bite to the next.

They did have some interesting Indian dishes which were well seasoned and I could even detect several layers of flavor, which does take some skill to pull off even in Indian cuisine.  They also had fresh baked garlic nam bread that they brushed with butter that I highly recommend.

The dessert station was average and included the usual tiny cakes, cheesecake, cookies, but the chocolate dipped strawberries tasted like wax, etc. 

So, to sum it up, if you find yourself at this buffet, skip all but the carving stations, the Indian food, and the dessert bar.  Perhaps they're in the process of learning from their mistakes, but at this point you could take a 10-minute walk in just about any direction and have a 4-5 star buffet experience at another hotel.  I highly recommend the buffets at The Bellagio, Planet Hollywood, and The Mirage over the one at Aria and they are competitively priced.  In fact, even if they cleaned up their act and got the Asian foods right at the Aria's buffet, their cafeteria-line set up is ill-equiped to effectively compete with the competition nearby.  At its best, this could potentially become a 3-star buffet in my opinion.",3,0,0

I don't fault Aria but any mass produced Buffett item that sits under heat lamps for awhile. As for the employees there, one was quite rude to me when I asked if they were still serving breakfast. The guy basically lectured me to open my eyes and look around. Pathetic excuse for a hospitality worker. As for the price, $300.00 was a lot to pay for 6 persons. I feel the service and quality of food is better at the Aria Cafe to which we are there twice on my trip. My personal recommendation is to dine at the Aria Cafe instead. Fresher and better quality food and the service there is better with nicer servers!",0,0,0

Only thing I was disappointed with are the Egg Rolls, they're terrible! I loved the seafood. However, they don't have a sushi selection. I saw one type of sushi and it looked like california rolls. It actaully looks like their menu changes periodically, so I won't comment on what I ate. 

Their waiter did a great job waiting on us. Kept our drinks filled, which was quite important for a group of hungover guys.

Pretty small selections, seems as if there werent a lot of selections. I mostly ate the clams\/mussels and they were DELICIOUS! They had the mini salad cup things next to the mussels and they were GOOD! well the one with the crumble cheese. The crab wasnt bad it was split in half so less hassle for us. Sushi was normal. Smoked salmon tasted like ham. The prime rib was pretty good. The custom made pasta need something im not sure what, but its cool how you can customize your own pasta.

Not because I ate too much, because I honestly have never eaten so little at a buffet before. I am in my room because the food at the Buffet at Aria is so bad that it made me sick.

For starters they sat me at a table under a light that kept going out so I had to change tables. I should have known right then that I was in trouble. 

I started out at the Asian section for some dim sum. The shrimp dumplings and chicken and pork shu-mai wasn't bad, but the bao was hard as a rock. For those of you who may not know what bao is, it's a steamed bun with chicken or pork instead. The steamed bun is supposed to be soft but these were so hard I didn't even attempt to eat it.

Then it was on to the carving station for some ham. I loves me some ham, but this ham was drier than my napkin. Two bites and I was done with that. I did have some garlic mashed potatoes which were actually very good. Hands down the best thing on the entire buffet.

Over to the Mediterranean  section where they were making fresh naan. Certainly they couldn't screw that up? Wrong. One bite and I was done. It was salty as hell and tasted like that made it with soy sauce, and a lot of it. The falafel was old, stale and tasteless.

Over to the Italian station for some pasta that didn't suck. They also had some decent salami and meats in the antipasto section.

Now time for the main course, CRAB LEGS!! Good size crab legs with decent amounts of meat, but they were old and the shells were impossible to navigate. Made it almost impossible to get to the meat. After a few minutes I stopped trying.

Walked around and checked out some other stuff. The pizza looked decent, but I had pizza in Five50 the day before so I wasn't really into pizza again. There was a sushi section, but it didn't look fresh or appealing at all so I decided to pass.

The one redeeming part was the dessert area. They had gelato which was actually quite good. The other desserts looked good as well, but my stomach was starting to not be happy because of how bad everything else was.

The waitress asked me if everything was okay. I told her the food was not good, she said sorry and walked away. That's good for your tip. And speaking of tips, they had a sign at the front suggesting you tip18%. Seriously? 18% at a Buffet where they just bring you a drink and clear your plates? I usually tip 20% at restaurants, but buffets get 10% tops. Less if I tell you the food sucks and you just walk away.

BTW, did I mention they charge $35 for this atrocity?!?! Wow.

My boyfriend and I came here for Lunch on a weekday. There was a small line outside at the entrance but the line moved fairly fast. We were in line for less than 10 min. Upon seating, our Server Linda came to the table right away and took our drink orders. Unlike other buffets in town, if you are drinking any soft drinks, water, juice, coffee, they are already included in the price. For alcohol, there is an extra $12.99 which is also a good deal for all-you-can-drink beer and wine. 

They have different stations at the buffet area for different cuisines, anything from Italian, French, American, Mexican,Asian, to seafood and desert. We started from the Beef Brisket, they give you a huge piece (good for the gentleman) and it is so tender and juicy. The fat and the lean meat are at a perfect ratio. One thing I was surprised that they didn't have is lamp chop, hopefully they can add that onto the menu soon. 

Their salad bar is very extensive. A friendly staff is behind the counter and mix your salad right there for you with the fresh ingredients of your choice, and salad dressing of your choice of course. I am very impressed by this because you know it is not some old salad they premade and let it sit there overnight. 

As for the Asian station, one thing I am not so satisfied is the sushi they offer. It is very simple cucumber roll and sushi with no-real-fish stuffing. But they do have sashimi and shrimp ceviche in a small cup to make it up :-) The Chinese food they offer is ok I will say, I had congee which is yummy and delicious but the dim sum is a little bit too dry. I dont think they made it themselves, probably from the box. 

Seafood is my personal favourite, they have snow crab legs, clams, mussles (both on ice and in soup). I love it! 

Last but not the least they have a great desert bar! 7 different kinds of icecream and all kind of different sweets! Perfect for the ones who have sweet tooth.

The pesto pasta was good, but it was the only pasta available besides some kind of Chinese noodle pasta. The pizza was also good but unless you get a slice right as they brought it out, it would get cold really fast (the heating plates didn't seem to work very well).

Its like they randomly selected a bunch of different food and hoped it was diverse enough to attract more people.

Aria is on the expensive side even by Vegas standards.   Better selection than most.  Appreciated the Indian food options and healthy portions of pre-cut crab legs that I didn't see at other buffets.  Their sushi was also pretty good but a bit annoying that there was far more sushi rice than fish.

All in all, I'd give the Aria 4 stars as far as buffets go so far as the food is concerned.  However, I feel compelled to ding them a star for their lack of a child rate.

I rarely buffet and went to Bacchanal a few days before this, but found it was good for $22.

Best things was the snow crab was quality and just as good as the Bacchanal was. The carving station had a roast pork and a beef brisket that were tender and flavorful.  A few of the dumplings from the Asian section was pretty good. I've never seen Indian station at a buffet before, but this had a decent chicken curry. Nice charcuterie selection, the ceviche and my white anchovy\/boquerones salad was good. There were a few misses, but minor like the pork belly steam bun was really dried out, I didn't like the satay chicken stick and one of my sushi pieces had crunchy rice. 

 Dessert wise, the buttscotch budino was really good. I had a few cookies and brownies and whoopie pies that were good as well, but that was the standout item.

Four of us ate an $80 meal for free.  That's good enough for me.

I was a bit leary also because I had read others' reviews, and I wasn't so sure it was going to be anything decent.  The Rio's World buffet was decent enough (for what I wanted), but there was just so much other BS that it was pretty unenjoyable for us.  Here, at the Aria buffet, we were pleasantly surprised.  I pretty much got cold foods like various kinds of ceviche, sushi, Thai salads, cold, poached whitefish, salmon spread.  The ceviches, in particular, were quite tasty, if not spicy, but I really enjoyed them all.  I didn't participate in their halved, ready to eat crab legs.  I had enough the night before.  I also couldn't muster up the desire to eat hot foods, then ultimately stuffing myself......so I didn't.  Plus, I had to save room for Jean Phillipe's pastries.....oh, hell YAH !!!  That was a MUST.  Unfortunately, for me, a pastry snob and baker in my own right, they were good, but they were NOT amazing.  Sorry, but they weren't.  I tasted the banana caramel cake, and it was just banana cake.  Couldn't taste caramel.  The apple rum raisin pie was overpowered by the rum flavored raisins......wasn't a fan.  The bread pudding was my favorite, that, I definitely liked.  I also tasted their strawberry gelato.......quite delicious and packing a strong strawberry punch.  The chocolate brownie was laced with too many walnuts......a turn-off for me.  The pecan bar was decent, but the cappuccino dollop didn't work with it.  Here's the other thing.......downstairs from the buffet is an actual shop of Jean Phillipe's pastries, and THOSE will dazzle your eyes.  THOSE were amazing to look at, and while I didn't get to try any (too full !!!), I would like to think they were better than was presented upstairs at the buffet.  I'd like to know why ALL of those items were not offered at the buffet.  That was a bit disappointing to me.  That being said, all too many times we have all discovered the oh so great looking food item LOOKS better than it tastes, so while I know to beware of the ""looks can be deceiving"" reality, I just don't know with the store displays...........those pastries are so impressive.

I would go back to this buffet again......maybe when I'm in a mood to try hot foods, perhaps more room in my stomach.  However, I would probably hold out for the Jean Phillipe Patisserie downstairs......gotta try some of those next time !!!!!  I think this place is 3.5 worthy, but all I can only select 3 on the scale.",1,1,1

We had dinner on Sunday night.  Price was $52 per person for everyone.  $52 per person, whether adult or kid!!!!  Only the 3-year old was free.  The remaining 5 kids, ages 4-7, each cost $52.   

The cashier, Paul, had a bad attitude and messed up our billing.   He originally charged $52 per person (gratuity already included per person for our large party).   After he charged 2 of our credit cards for the group, we asked him about the kids prices.   When he found out one of them was 3 years and should've been free, he gave us an attitude like it was our fault for not telling him up front. 

Then the bad attitude continued as he tried to figure out how to give $52 back.  The whole line got held up because of his mistake, yet people were looking my family like it was our fault. 

So then we get to our table, and we get a waiter who was pretty inattentive.   We weren't eating and drinking at a very fast rate at all.  But we still had to wait for extended times to get drink refills and plates cleared.  

The food was OK, not worth $52.   Dim sum containers had nothing in them.  The available tuna sushi looked old and dry.  The warm steamed crab legs were a pile of broken unappetizing looking legs.   

Good news is the oysters were good.  So was the prime rib.   Otherwise, hit and miss on the dishes offered at Aria. 

As far as I'm concerned, it's better to pay up more and get amazing food and service upstairs at Carbone, or else get the overpriced pizza at Slaters or $10-12 burgers at the burger place.  

The crazy thing is that you would think the $52 buffet price point would weed out some of the jackass patrons.  But it didn't.  There were idiot diners who took serving tongs and spoons from one dish to scoop out food from other nearby dishes.   There were also gluttons who did things like hoard oysters and crab legs on multiple plates at a time, leaving nothing for anyone else.  

I'm not dinging Aria for the idiot eaters.   But as far as the price, value, cashier and waiter service, $52 is not worth it all.

SERVICE\/FOOD
perhapes the SMALLEST buffet selection i've ever had in my 4 years living in Vegas.   there is nothing on the menu that you can't find with a larger selection at other buffets...   and the limit of ONE small lobster tail per customer to substantiate the inflated price is seriously insulting...

They had the basics covered, Asian, Italian, Mexican, American, and a good variety of desserts. 

The servers were friendly and I see them moving quick trying to maintain their section. The prices are fair as well. 

I do suggest playing those M Life app games that they offer for special deals and discounts. Its free to play and the points can be used towards real deals.

Specifically, the cashier who checked in me and rang up my sale was really horribly rude to me. I was lined up to redeem my myvegas reward for myself, however I had another person at my party who was in a different line. As soon as I walked up she barked ""How many people in your party"" in a bored yet aggravated tone, as if I was inconveniencing her. Wanting to sit with my friend but not wanting to be charged for two buffets, I started to explain: ""Well, I am redeeming a reward from Myvegas but...""  That's when she cut me off by saying ""NO, I asked you HOW MANY PEOPLE IN YOUR PARTY?"".  I was speechless for a second then decided to reply lest I incur more of her wrath. ""OK, I have two"". She quickly rang me up for two buffets although I could see my friend across the other line already paying for hers. Then she asked ""How are you paying?"" like some angry robot. I replied that i am using a Myvegas reward - this is true. She then asked me ""NO, how are you paying for the difference""? ""Well, I am NOT paying for the difference. There are two people in my party but I am paying for myself only. I was trying to tell you."" She just looked at me like I had bananas coming out of my ears, then said "" You know you can redeem both rewards here"" and proceeded to ring up the meal silently (but still with attitude) handing me the folio with my receipt.  That's nice lady but that's not what's happening. If you didn't cut me off mid-sentence,  you'd know what's going on. 

So, this unfortunately ruined the lunch for me. It's very disappointing considering the reputation of Aria as a 4-star resort.

The setting is beautiful, with a view of the pool complex and a lot of natural light. I love the trend towards using natural light that is in the newer Vegas properties. 

Both of my experiences have been with the lunch selections. I love that for an extra ten dollars, you can add on bottomless Mimosas or Blood Marys. This is a bargain and the servers keep your glasses full. Services is great here.

The food is high quality and I although I felt like it had a smaller selection that other similar buffets (Wynn\/Bellagio), I still found plenty to enjoy. Aria, like other high end buffets, has crab leg already cracked. As far as I am concerned, this is the only way to eat crab legs. I don't like fighting with my food! My boyfriend's mom found plenty of vegetarian options that she enjoyed. 
 
My only complaint is the that the shrimp cocktail comes in little cups of two. At most buffets, this is my favorite item and I can eat a bunch. Granted, you can technically take as many cups as you want, but it seems that the demand is higher than they can keep up with. The presentation is nice in the cups, but they should just put it on a platter and let people help themselves.

A MAJOR warning: if you are a group of 8 or more, they add a MANDATORY 18% gratuity. I strongly disagree with this since it is a BUFFET. I realize a large group requires extra attention but since table service is basically busing plates and beverage service, 18% is excessive.

We were not holding out much hope. I have to say we were very pleasantly surprised! The value for money was exceptional (around ¬£12-15) for a really decent standard of food and well cooked to boot. 
The selection on offer ranged from sushi to roasts, to french and Indian, all pretty authentically cooked (a bit of a revelation for vegas!). We were having a day off the booze so cannot comment on the wine - but the wine inclusive deal was very reasonable.
The surroundings were pleasant, the selection of food utterly enourmous and there were not too many people. Probably the most decent meal we ate in Vegas, all in all. It must be very heavily subsidised by the casino - it is a fairly new, modern 5 star, so I think they need to get people in the casino.

They have a wide range of ethnic food-Chinese, Mediterranean, Italian, and American.  I usually get my usual Chinese, pizza, cheese bites, eggs, bacon, and chicken garlic sausages. Next I go back to see what I missed and noticed fried chicken which was crunchy and moist and small little waffles.  I also noticed they have lobster claws next to the shrimp.  The claws had plenty of meat inside.  After eating 2 plates of food, I like to look at the desserts. I love their chocolate croissants, gelato, and coffee cake.  iThe food are fresh and plentiful to anyone who likes to eat buffet.

Without a doubt, I can say this: The really good food like the snow crab legs, the bone marrow, and the fish and chips during dinner was exceptional. It is almost made to order since food turns rather quickly.  The prime rib was also on point. 

However, not everything is great here.  What used to be good, it is not anymore. The Ethnic stations like the Chinese, Mexican, and Italian doesn't taste authentic and doesn't taste fresh.  The Chinese stir fry meat to vegetable ratio proportion could be better. Also it could be that most people ignore these over popular ethnic foods and freshness goes downhill over time. 

In addition, service here for us during dinner a few weeks ago was slightly unappealing.  When the waitress with the drinks asked me for what to drink, I mentioned the four drinks for our party. But when I was about to order the 5th drink, she had stopped me and told me to wait until the second round. During the whole time at dinner, we've only seen her once.  I purposely stacked my plates about 10 high just to get her attention.  But unfortunately, that didn't work. 

I will say the desserts here are excellent as well, especially the Gelato Bar. So in short, get the good stuff that there's a line for and pass on the usual ""buffet"" food. 

Anyways, for $38.99 for dinner yes it's a bit steep. However, the saving grace to this place is Kids from 5-12 eat free with a paying adult. No buffet I know currently has kids eat free and this place allows four kids to eat free with one paying adult! Total steal if you're stuck with the kids.

My wife and I where here in October 2012 and we visited the buffet one night for dinner. The price was about the $35 mark and we also brought the drinks package for the $12. 

We found the food was a great selection and the waitress was always filling our wine glass up each 5 minutes. 
 
So under $100 we had a great value dinner with drinks and found the food was fresh and lots of flavours

The waitress also told us that in a few months that the buffet was going to be upgraded. 

On the 4\/4\/2013 we returned back to Vegas and booked back in with Aria, we had a long flight from Miami and we're starving. So we made our way back to the Buffet for dinner. 

To our shock the price that night just to eat was $43 each, with taxes our and NO drinks our cost wad $97. But with a new seafood bar we thought it should be worth it. 

We started at the Chinese section and found the food well below par. 

We moved onto the ""Fresh Seafood bar"", I had the prawns, crab legs. I took one bite of the prawns and they had no taste, I then started on the Crab legs and they too had no taste. The taste was like they had been defrosted and left in cold water for hours before been placed in the bar. 

I left a entire plate of seafood on my table that I was unable to eat. 

The only saving grace at the buffet is the Red meat section, the beef was full of flavour and had a great pink centre to it. 

For a price of $100, we were left with a huge disappointment not only from the buffet, but also from the waitress that because we decided not to buy the drinks package we had to ask for water at each time. 

I doubt that I will every return to the buffet on our next return to Aria.",5,0,0

The upside is that I think they spent all the time and effort on the dessert section.  The dessert offerings were plated individually and they were beautiful!  They also tasted good.  My favorites were the Nutella cake and the caramel flan.  Ice cream, cookies, biscotti, and brownies were also offered.

Our server was very attentive and nice.  I cannot say the same for the people manning the different food areas.  No one could tell me what veggie was in the chicken curry (I figured out it was spinach).

The pasta tasted cheap and unflavorful. They had mexican and asian food that didn't look good at all. My husband loaded up on the crab legs that he said were good but the crawfish he didn't enjoy. He also had a slice of prime rib that he said was 'meh'.

The dessert selection and taste were dissapointing as well. We were thankful that we paid the lunch price of $25.99 per person and not the Holiday dinner price of $43.99.

service:
service was really good, and the staff was very nice.  our whole group was pretty drunk and they were still very nice to us and explained all the stuff for the buffet.  at the table they were fast bringing more drinks and they were fast at taking away plates but were not always there and getting in your way

value:
i think the buffet was pretty good value at $35.  selection was more than bellagio, but the food itself was not quite as good.  about the same amount, maybe a little less selection than wicked spoon but there were different choices.  you get half a lobster per person too, but it wasn't really that big so i didn't think much of it, and i also am not a huge lobster person.  the thing that i think puts the aria up there is that you get unlimited merlot or chardonnay with dinner which is cool.  i am not a huge wine person, but free booze is free booze

food:
there was a large selection, and for the most part there was not anything i didn't like.  sushi was better than wicked spoon, but not as good as bellagio.  they had a cool little greek section which i really liked between the salads lamb and other offerings.  the crab was really good (didn't taste like salt water, it actually tasted pretty good), the lobster was kinda rubbery and not too much flavor, but i always feel that lobster is like that which is why i am not a huge lobster fan as said earlier.  the shrimps by the crab with the shells still on were very good, along with the already prepared shrimp cocktales.  the pizza was decent, along with the fish and chips.  the only thing i don't think i liked was the baby back ribs.  they were just so fatty that it was not enjoyable to eat them.  dessert was a small section, but the choices all tasted pretty good, and they had butterfinger gelato which was absolutely amazing.

overall, I would probably come back, but i wouldn't make it a priority as i love going to different buffets all the time",2,0,0

International food selection okay although the wide array is not as much as The Vikings in my home country (PH) which is our favorite. Loved their desserts, chowders and pastas. The fruit shakes we got were also quite good and our very friendly and warm server (a Filipina compatriot) was prompt to offer and refill our drinks. She even cheerfully took our photos. 
In my country, seafood is plentiful and can be found really fresh, so I detected a hint of lack of freshness in the crab legs which is still understandable. But am amazed at the quantity available. And many I saw actually were very happy with them. People had to queue for the crab legs because of so many wanting to get them over and over again. 
Saw a long line outside wanting to come in. Grateful we didn't have to wait in line as our host made a reservation. 44sh degrees celsius outside so thumbs up too for their powerful a\/c.

No, they have servers to bring you drinks. Why? It's a buffet. Seriously, I can carry my own drink over to my table. I understand if you had ordered alcohol, but they should have a section for people that order the drink-add on option. This appears to be an excuse to add gratuity to every bill despite making it appear like something you can choose to do.

I went to see  the newly renovated buffet at the Aria last week. They did a good job with the remodel. The place is more friendly but also more upscale. The food is easier to access.

The menu is not dramatically different from before but there are some new additions. It appeared to me that they were doing their best to copy the buffet at the Cosmopolitan Hotel. 

There was a nice wide selection. The problem? 50% of the things I selected were either downright cold or lukewarm - maybe tepid. The other 50% ranged from warm to almost hot.

It appears it's not possible (at least at the Aria) to serve hot food on a buffet. 

The prices are in line with other upscale buffets in the area. The food while cold, did have very nice flavors. The chef knows what he\/she is doing. There were some very nuanced dishes - very sophisticated for a buffet.

Glad we went. The buffet wasn't as diverse as Bachannal at Caesars but the prime rib and crab were delicious!!!! They had snow crab legs, stone crab claws, as well as king crab legs!!!! I loved how they were served cracked and sliced in half for easy access to the succulent crab meat. So good!!!!!!!

Make sure you try the prime rib as the serve it bone-in which gives such a great rich flavor to the meat and makes it very moist.

There was about a fifteen minute wait at about 11 a.m., which I thought was a little surprising.  

After having gone to Bachannal for dinner the night before, I wasn't sure my stomach would be able to handle another buffet, but I often think of brunch the way some people think about desserts - it deserves its own stomach!

There's a lot of selection here.  For $30 per person (and an additional $12 for bottomless drinks), I'd say it's a decent deal for a Vegas buffet.  I skipped over most of the Asian food since it looked mostly like reheated frozen stuff and helped myself a lot of the other things.  There's too much to name, but let me hit some of the highlights:  amazing breakfast pizza, yummy pre-made waffles (with different fillings - try the banana), decent corned beef hash, your own made-to-order eggs benedict bar,  a variety of refreshing pre-made salads, an interesting assortment of Indian foods (including naan and curried veggies and meats), etc.  They also have a made-to-order eggs and omelette station.  The ham at the carving station was delicious - lean but tender and flavorful - they have prime rib too if that's your fancy.  In other words, there's something for everyone here!

There were some foods that weren't so great.  I felt like this was much more common in the dessert department.  For example, the donut that I had tasted crusty and dry, and a lot of their cakes tasted like they'd been sitting out for a while.  I probably wouldn't get an omelette again either - they're far too big and I don't like how they don't wrap the ingredients inside but instead intersperse them throughout the egg batter.

Service:  Can't compare to the service you get at Bachannal.  They seem understaffed here (even though the restaurant wasn't at full capacity), and you have to exert some energy to flag someone down.

Bottom line:  A decent option for a brunch buffet in Vegas.  I am realizing I forgot to try the gelato so next time...",4,1,1

If you like Prime Rib and Beef Brisket you won't leave hungry, although at a buffet that's not saying much. 

Some times the crab legs are awesome, but most of the time they just look like absolute garbage. Same with the Pizza. They used to have the greatest pesto pizza ever, but not since the remodel, which is a real shame.

The overarching theme of this buffet is probably ""unrealized potential."" A lot of the food would be really good if made to order, but unfortunately they just make a ton of everything and leave it to sit and get soggy, burnt or otherwise go from great to gross.

The sushi, for example, is made using good fish, then put on a tray, covered in plastic wrap and left to sit in a fridge until the rice is hard and it's just garbage. Same with the burritos and the asian food. A lot of the issues would be solved, I think, if they just made smaller portions more often.

The guacamole, mashed potatoes, prime rib, basically anything that the quality doesn't go downhill when it sits out, are all amazing. Anything where the quality degrades though, expect it to be disgusting.

 It's our first stay here at Aria so the next thing to do would be to try the buffet. Dinner price is usual around 40 bucks per person which includes half of a lobster lol. The buffet seemed to have 50% salad items. There's about over 10 kinds of salads and not enough variety for other things. I guess the best way to get your money's worth is loading up with the crabs. The sushi is buffet quality,( not the greatest)  rice was a little hard but I am very much fond of the dessert counter. Lots to choose from, but the best one would the banana cream pie.

Breakfast Buffett at the Aria $15.95 per person includes unlimited coffee and soft drinks as well. Large square layout of food in ultra modern setting with spacious seating.  Our server was good about keeping up with our large party but I'm stunned they would not put the coffee pot down on the table. Guess to much waste is take on it.  Either way she was pretty good about it. 

Starts on one side with an impressive array of pastries, cookies and pies and every other baked good known to man.  Followed by a Asian display of various items I normally don't eat for breakfast.  Then you move around and stage 3 is blintzes and crepes and various cold cuts.   You make the turn and it's your standard breakfast fare with eggs, bacon, sausage.  Keep going Pizza 4 types including an egg breakfast pizza.  And on to pancakes and waffles. OH WAIT Mexican Station, with breakfast burriottos etc.    OK not full yet omelets station and carving station with giant fresh sausage and ham.  throw in some free range chicken being carved right there as well.  Undaunted and want more how about bagels various crazy type cr√®me cheeses and spreads followed by a large fruit display along with country biscuits and gravy YUM!


GOD HELP ME I'm about to burst.   I know I know all buffets are like this.  Well maybe so, but place was laid out nicely food was hot and fresh and tasty and service very good. For $15.00 how can you go wrong especially since a coffee and one pastry at the take out coffee shop costs about $9.00.

I don't understand the negative reviews at all. remember you are reviewing this as a buffet not comparing a $16.00 breakfast extravaganza against Smith & Wolenskis.

The food was OK and it was hot and well marked. Just seemed like a ghost town so I sat by a window near the only other human life forms there. It was fun watching a man pull the crab meat from the claws and put them on a plate for her. Turns out she had really nice nails and he was just a gentleman.

Since I had paid a lot for lunch.... I lingered at the desert station and did find some excellent hot deserts.

Honestly.... This is the most inhospitable and unwelcoming resort in Vegas. I can afford to stay anywhere so just checked out and into a suite at the MGM Grand. Better view and guaranteed vibe.

It's probably at the bottom of my top buffets and slowly moving off my top list completely!  to go to with the WYNN being at the top followed by the Cosmopolitains buffet. Here's why.. I think that for $39.99 a person the quality of meats and seafood could've been much more better. I know they can do better because I've had better here! The crab legs have two different options.. Both cold and hot.. Neither one of them were worth my time or up to par for me tonight.. The warm ones barely had any crab meat inside and the cold ones had the worse ""fishy"" taste to them which in result turned me completely off! They market these ""endless"" crab legs all over the place like they are something to write home about..more like write home and tell them how worthless they are is more like it! I headed to the meat carving station and went with the beef ribs and the center island station was preparing sirloin steaks at your request. The ribs were so dry I had to soak them in bbq sauce to save the day. The steak was Probably was the best part of my visit. I feel like there could've been more and for $86 and some change for two people I left with a bit of dissatisfaction that's for sure. Took forever for refills on drinks! And To leave an even more bitter taste in my mouth I got home to only find out that the cashier over charged me for the buffet an additional $39.99 and although yes she reversed it she could've at least told me there was an error! I had to call the next morning the find out the explanation for this charge. Manager explained she didn't see the charge but from what I explained she could only imagine that the cashier already reversed it and because it was the weekend I wouldn't see my money until Monday..smh go figure!

My initial judgement was that this was not nearly as bog of a buffet line at other price comparable hotels. They have like 8 (I know that seems like a lot but it really isn't) stations. Although I really dug that crab legs were included in the regular buffet, everything else we got was mediocre, at best. We came around 1 pm which is pretty much prime time for lunch, but everything in the trays looked like it had been there for quite some time under those heat lamps, thus making everything look old and unappetizing. I made about 4 plates trying to get something I liked but ended up leaving 80% of each uneaten. Service was ok, (and we even tipped 20% in advance, something I regret) but the drink glasses were so tiny we definitely should have been checked on more than 2 times in an hour and a half.

Exceptionally well-presented and prepaid, the mix runs from bean burritos to pizza to prime rib and a sushi selection rivaling any good restaurant. 

The desserts are very good and handled by a cut-above of staffers. We spaced and timed our consuming to go back for several plates, shared a few things just to try them and had two hours of careful sampling. The big portions went to carved prime rib and the sushi, but not all at once. Tip big; if you're half-smart, the casino will give it back and for our staffers, well-deserved.

Oh? You didn't look for incentive programs to eat here on a two-for-one or comp? That one's on YOU. Cut the cost to at least half and you've scored bragging rights. 

Las Vegas fare runs from damn awful to sublime, so how you eat is on you: bad nutrition is plentiful; cheap chow and sloppy consumers are plentiful outside, so why not dress a bit nicer and enjoy the Aria's Crystal area?

But for me, Aria's is the best! The day after I visited, I went to Bacchanal for dinner and spent the whole time wishing it was half as good as Aria

I spent an embarrassing amount of time playing and accumulating reward points on the MyVegas game so I redeemed some for a bogo offer on a breakfast or lunch buffet. 

My boyfriend and I arrived around 10:15am on a Thursday. There was about a 5 minute wait. We opted for the unlimited beverages - choices included beer, mimosas, bloody Mary's, sangria, cranberry spritzer, etc. (much nicer than Bacchanal, where I had to stick to one drink!). Our waitress was super friendly (best service we had all trip) and most importantly, kept the drinks rolling!

There were a ton of choices for breakfast - traditional  options like eggs and bacon, assorted waffles , carved meats, congee, burritos, smoked salmon, made to order eggs Benedict, omelette station, etc. 

We must've timed it very well as lunch items came out soon after. Lots of seafood options, including 2 types of mussels, crawfish, coconut shrimp, peel-and-eat shrimp, and fried fish. The best item, however, was the crab! I actually hate how some buffets split the legs and keep them chilled. Here, you could get them whole and warm! They did score some of the harder pieces to crack, like the claw, which was much appreciated.

After all of that and a scoop of green tea gelato, I was a happy camper, ready to gamble my savings away. I'm really over the hype of Vegas buffets, but I'll be sure to hit Aria every time I visit!

recap:
Management: 1 star
Service: 2 stars
Food: 4 stars
Deserts: 5 stars

We paid $23 for the Weekend Brunch (Sat & Sun 7am-4pm). It's a great food value and for another $7 you can get all-you-can-drink champagne or Bloody Mary's. 

Here's the problem with The Buffet at Aria--the management is terrible and the service is mediocre. When we paid (as we walked in) we were asked by the cashier if we wanted the champagne or Bloody Mary's and a few of us were trying to decide what mood we were in. 

The cashier said: ""You can choose now, and change your mind later."" I'm sure she was trying to keep the line going.
A problem occurred when a few of us ""changed our minds"" at the table and the waiter said ""No."" We had to stick with what we originally ordered.
What? 
We explained that the cashier told us we could change our minds and the waiter again insisted that that was ""the rule"" and there would be no exceptions. 
No exceptions. (This phrase was uttered to me six times in the next 20 minutes)
We protested until it became uncomfortable and then I asked for the manager.

Again, we just wanted to switch our drink order from Bloody Mary to champagne. 
The manager arrived and told us many people want to ""switch"" and it is not allowed. We explained that the cashier told us we could. And she insisted that we couldn't. 

We were a table of 8, and it became uncomfortable, and so many of our friends said: ""that's ok...we'll just have the Bloody Mary. Or: you can have my champagne."" At some level everyone just wanted to keep the peace. 

I informed the woman she was a very poor manager because while I understood the ""no switch rule"", she should stand by her employee's word. (The cashier said we could switch!)

Her retort was that the cashier's were part-time employees and they didn't know what they were taking about, and she wouldn't ""honor"" their word.

In the end, after an uncomfortable and lengthy confrontation, the manager let one person switch (and warned us that she couldn't switch back.) It was ridiculous and unacceptable behavior from a manager and I was shocked. Aria should be ashamed.",1,0,0

It's $30 per person and I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to get my $30 worth, but I feel pretty confident that I did. The hostesses were not very nice or welcoming. Perhaps they were overwhelmed. Our hostess put us in a both right next to the desserts, so I felt pretty forgiving.

The big buffet feature is king crab legs, nicely split up for eating. I don't eat crab, but the many people hauling plates of it looked pretty happy. Other stations included sushi, salad, fruit, comfort food, slabs of meat, Mexican dishes, Indian food, pizza, cheese cubes, Chinese food and, of course, dessert.

I wasn't impressed with the sushi, although I do appreciate the existence of the vegetarian roll. The pizza wasn't good, either. In fact, I didn't eat my entire half slice of pizza, which is highly unusual for a pizza connoisseur as myself. The Chinese food was excellent--moo goo gai pan, steamed vegetables, seaweed salad, tofu! All of the food was fresh, delicious and labeled--no mystery items. The desserts were by far the most popular. There was a sundae bar, cookies, pudding-type desserts and tiny plated pieces of creme brulee, cheesecake, chocolate pudding and something really delicious made with nutella.

Overall, I enjoyed it. I think the $15 breakfast or $20 lunch buffets might be a better deal, but I have no complaints. Actually, I take that back. I wish there was a self-service drink station.

Then again, the Golden Corral doesn't cost $40 either.  And that was the price for dinner at Aria on a Sunday night.  With that, you get the buffet, half of a small lobster and apparently limitless red or white wine (though certainly nobody seemed in a hurry to offer refills).  

The buffet did have an interesting assortment of items.  I saw one man attacking the crab legs and shrimp as if he had not eaten in months and we felt someone would come along at any moment and drag his food away.  

The bread pudding and bananas foster both seemed pretty outstanding among the desserts.  As for the food, it seemed fresh enough.  There were several options for ceviche.  Some Chinese food.  Nachos.  Pizza.  A carving station with beef, ham, turkey, and salmon.  And an actual salad bar.

There was absolutely no item in the place that made me think ""I will have to come back for this.""  Yes, you can eat a lot and get stuffed--but is being stuffed really the goal of eating?  There are so many other places from which to choose in the area that I'd much rather spend $40 a person and come away feeling pleasantly full and having a memorable meal elsewhere.  

Again, as far as buffets go, it may be great.  I have no idea.  I'm not a connoisseur of the buffet.  As far as restaurants where you'll spend a couple of hundred dollars for a small party to eat, there are many, many better options.",3,1,1

It's a buffet so I don't expect things to taste like it's from a michelin star winning restaurant but nothing tasted good here. Asian dishes were really salty and in the Latin section it had onion and cilantro and the onions were chopped in huge chunks like the chef just didn't give a shit. Soda was so flat it just tasted like sugar water and the waitress was nice but the service was so slow because the server was overworked. You would expect much more from a such nice hotel but they serve you with subpar prison cafeteria food that costs $45 a person.

There's this station that prepares fresh seafood for you or, sometimes, surf and turf, depending on the day, but this time on Father's Day, it was salmon, prawns and scallops. The salmon and prawns weren't cooked thoroughly, the core of it was still raw. I'm surprised that they didn't prepare something special for this day and at $50 per person you'd think there would be champagne included, which did occur at least one time we went there. There seems to be a lot of stations but there isn't really a great selection, we ended up eating a lot of steamed snow crab legs as that was the only thing that was adequate and a good choice for the price being paid.

I know you'll find a lot of reviews for this buffet saying that it was a great buffet and that it was amazing but those people have probably NOT had the buffets at Caesars (Bacchanal) or the Wynn buffet or etc. because those are far better in quality and overall food selection. The buffet here at Aria is okay. The selection of food was very underwhelming, not very many choices. The size of the buffet is fairly small as well. The seating area is pretty large but the buffet itself is kinda small. Aria is one of the newer and nicer hotel\/casinos on the strip and you would expect the buffet to be superb but it's really not. The selection of sushi was very limited to like 2 or 3 kinds and I'm not even a big sushi person. The meat section was terrible. The prime rib looked almost rare, which is gross and especially at a buffet. The beef ribs were also seemingly undercooked. This buffet is less than decent. If you're in vegas then chances are that you're visiting and hitting up a buffet is almost on everyones ""to do list"". Buffets are pretty expensive and honestly just spend the extra money and go to the Bacchanal at Caesars, it's totally worth it trust me. And to top it all off, my 14 year old sister got major food poisoning after eating here. My friends came with us as well and they were both vomiting after eating there also. We only came here because the line at Caesars was too long and we figured that Aria would have a good buffet given the stature of Aria but it was very disappointing. I know that the management reads these reviews so if you're looking for ways to improve your buffet then you need to add more items that are at the other top tier buffets and teach your waiters about customer service. Our waitress walked by our table at least 3 to 4 times before coming to our table to clean up, and that was after I had to ask for her. I spent more than $200 bucks here for 4 people and it was definitely not worth it. Don't come here, pay a little more and go to Caesars.",0,0,0

I was sorely disappointed. This buffet lacked selections. They tried to be different and unique, but they fail miserably. Every dish at the Aria Buffet tried to be a little bit different than your traditional Las Vegas buffet. So it sets up the expectation for more refined flavors and quality. Well, 

The Indian station is interesting, but the flavors were unauthentic. The Chinese station was terrible...I'd rather eat at Panda Express! The Sushi station...ummm, I almost missed the 4 types of very ordinary and cheap rolls (and there was so much rice in the sushi that you could hardly tell it was sushi!). The ""sage"" rotisserie chicken had no flavor. The smoked pork chop was humongous...but had very little smoke flavor.

The crab legs were good, but the melted butter had no flavor. The prime rib was good (and rare!), but the whipped horseradish was terrible...there were clumps of cream...and I had to use my fork to break up the cream and mix with the pure horseradish. Really???

The desserts really piqued my interest, and since I didn't gorge on the savory items like I usually do at buffets...I had plenty of room for dessert! So here's my rundown:

-Gelato was great, but such a limited selection.
-Creme Brulee was delicious!
-Cheesecake was not rich enough nor was the crust hearty enough.
-Sugar-free Chocolate Cake was decent...but couldn't they use some Splenda?
-Cookies were so-so...I've had better at cheaper buffets.

I waited approximately 45 minutes from the time I entered the line and was seated. The wait time was what I had expected. 

The waitress received my drink order immediately following when I was seated. The waitress came back about 7 minutes later and asked again what I would like to drink. Another 3 minutes passed until the water was served. She did however bring me two of them so this was helpful.

I tried a sample portion of each of these. Aside from the shrimp and a crab legs and claws which I had several of. 

The rest of the reviewers are correct in their description of the hot crab legs and cold ones. They were very watery and the flavor was ehhhh. The cooked chilled shrimp were perfectly cooked and the shell pre-sliced at the mud vein for easy access. Their wasn't any boil mix added to it that I could taste. 

The crawfish were on part for every single buffet I have ever been to. Bland, overcooked, dead ones cooked as well, and definitely not presoaked to make them purge. There was zero boil mix added to them for flavor. They were extremely muddy flavored. I really don't understand how so many restaurants can manage to screw up something which can so easily be made by taking an extra hour of time to prepare. They difference between what they all seem to do and the few extra steps and time it takes to prepare them properly is night and day in flavor. Oh well, I always have my people in Louisiana for excellent crawfish. The corn on the cob was overcooked and also had very little flavor. 

The chorizo sausage, and chicken jalape√±o sausage were extremely dry. 

The chicken had a decent breading on it but was also overcooked. 

The carved chicken and turkey were very moist. 

The cashew chicken was made in a style which if I hadn't known I would have said it was made by someone at their house and not a restaurant.

The broccoli beef was grisly, and one of the worst flavored I have tasted. 

The custard bun dough was perfectly cooked but very bland custard in the center. 

I am not sure how they managed to screw up an apple pie, but they did. The bread pudding as well. Both had no real flavor, definitely didn't have much cinnamon in either, not much sugar either (think diabetic bland.) This is the first place I have ever been where the apple pie was so below average I couldn't finish it. It looked like they added pine nuts into the bread pudding. 

The pot said it was chicken soup but it tasted like ground up rice in water.

The lamb ossobuco the broth was fabulous. But the lamb was not cooked properly so it was tough and chewy. 

Synopsis: Even for the slightly lower price then other casino buffet for lunch $25.99, it was no where worth the price. If you need and like foods which are prepared with no spices or few if any, like dessert which is diabetic sugar free tasting, food which is about 15%-25% overcooked, seafood which is water logged, then this will be a smash hit with you.",0,0,0

Aria Buffet is indeed overpriced, but it is good to come here right before 11am during the weekday to eat lunch for breakfast prices cause the breakfast price (~17) is too expensive for just breakfast food and the crabs and sushi comes out at 11am. 

The Good:  
Modern Chic Design and clean interiors. 
The sushi (salmon\/tuna nigiri) and several rolls are actually decent quality for a buffet.  
The crabs are served cold, but you can hand your plate of crabs to a server behind the counter and they will steam it for you. 
Garlic Naan Bread and curry dishes over jasmine rice is very good.
Cuts of meats - Prime Rib, Pork Belly have always been good. 
Desserts - Very good even though the selection may be small, I usually end up taking 3-4 cakes)
Coffee is also quite good. 
The line is usually shorter than most Buffets. 

The Bad:
Way too Expensive for Lunch, Dinners and Weekend Brunch.  
Cashiers have always been quite rude.  
Selection is small and there are no unique entrees.",0,0,0

She had trouble cancelling it. Had me waiting 20 minutes while she tried to cancel it. Finally called a manager to come fix it. She had no idea how to fix it either.

 While I was eating she came up and said she had to call the supervisor who was off site cuz he\/she the only one who knows how to fix it. Weird. You'd think the manager would know how to cancel a transaction. The manager kept me updated about how things are going but I got the feeling shr just wanted to get rid of  me. My feelings turned out to be true. 

She finally waz able to cancel it told me to sign the void and left. No offer of any compensation no coupon for  free meal just a thank you and go.

The Italian section consisted of some cheeses, deli meats, a conspicuous make-your-own-pasta station and a few vegetarian options.

I think the quality was good because there was a good number of people eating so they were turning over the food pretty quickly.

So we walked over toThe Buffet at the beautiful Aria Resort and Casino which was right across from our hotel the Vdara. 

I noticed many of the reviews listed are for the dinner buffet, keep in mind this review is for the breakfast buffet. 

The moment we arrived, i noticed quite a long lineup which lead me to believe two things, either its a very good buffet and its super busy, or the service was going to be bad. Well has it turned out (luckily) it was the first point. We waited for about 15mins before we were seated, not bad at all. You have to pay first before you can enter and the cost was 15.95! I was stunned, that is an amazing price for the breakfast experience I was about to have. 

The Buffet is an open concept and bright space. The decor was very "" vegas"" in that it was chic and the consistent elements from outside the hotel were carried inside. Since the Aria itself is quite new in Vegas it was very modern and this translated to the decor inside. The tables were spaced out well, so that i didn't have others staring at my plate to see what I got. :) 

The service was excellent. The lady that served our table was very attentive, friendly, and made some great suggestions on what to get. 

The buffet itself was laid out quite well. You had lots of room to maneuver around to get to the food you want. But with this place, trust me you will want everything. 

The food was fresh, you had your standard fare of eggs, bacon, potatoes etc, but you also had many unique dishes. Too many to list here.. The omelets are amazing...the Portuguese sausage..yum...they also had some chinese items in the buffet..the cakes..the fruit..you name it..it was amazing. 

If your in Vegas and want a great breakfast buffet..you gotta try this place...forget the Bellagio breakfast buffet..its over hyped..food not as fresh.overpriced...but that is for another review..;)",2,0,0

The regular line up to get in was PACKED, so if it wasn't for the line pass we had, it would've been bye bye to the buffet.

Been here before last year and it seems the quality has gone down. The food was okay, but there really wasn't anything to write home about. They have your standard stuff that can be found in other buffets like shrimps, prime rib, roasted chicken, etc etc. They also have the king crab legs which seem to be the main attraction as I saw many people just having piles and piles of them on their plates. I didn't try the king crab legs as I'm not fond of them in general. I found many of the food to be kinda dry and so I have to put a lot of sauce on them to taste better.

The best part I found was the dessert. They have different kinds of dessert from creme brulee to creampuffs to different flavors of ice cream, as well as brownies, banana fosters, and cookies. I tried the creme brulee and cookies and they're pretty good. Better than the main stuff honestly.

Pop and juice are included in the price, so try to take advantage of that.

Not worth the $30-something for lunch, but ok for the regular $20-something.",1,0,0

There was no line, no flies, the alcohol menu wasn't outrageously priced, and the food was decent. I had beef (it got cold and try by the time I brought it to my table), green beans, orange chicken (again, cold), basmati rice, and flan (I think the caramel was burned because the caramel sauce was bitter). I was disappointed with how quickly my food got cold but whatever, it was all edible. I didn't go back for seconds either. I wasn't really into the selection of food they had out today and I think it takes more effort to screw up the taste of flan than making it taste good.

Like the center counters, one side would be hot food and the other side would be crab legs. The set up just wasn't all that easy. Presentation was just ok.

So I made a beeline there while at Bally's for a conference. Lucky for me, I ran into a concierge who was waiting for a chef to show someone around who had celiac. I wound up getting a full tour of the buffet and learned what was safe to eat -- which was a surprising amount. Things I would not have thought of were made gluten-free, like corn fritters and tiramisu (made with a combination of almond and tapioca flour -- I need to learn how to make this!!!). 

The pho station also worked when you chose veggie miso broth and soba (buckwheat noodles). They also have gluten-free pizza and pasta cooked to order if you want, but I overstuffed myself on crab legs, tacos, veggies, carving station meats, pho, and lots of tiramisu :)

My server was very nice and as soon as some wayward crab fell off my plate (no cracking utensils readily available, so it was bound to happen), someone stopped by to clean it up. I think it helped that I was in town just before March Madness and St. Patrick's Day, so not as many people around Vegas in general. Made for a more sane experience.

The only thing that tasted off were the fish tacos -- seems like they had been sitting around for a while and tasted fishy and cold. I didn't get sick from anything I ate, however, so I was a happy camper. Props to the chef for thinking of us gluten-free folks!",3,1,1

I wouldn't have chosen to eat at this buffet, but my colleague and I were exhausted after a full day at the Aria conference center and this was the only on-site restaurant that wasn't filled to capacity.

Maybe I just don't like the Vegas buffet experience.  Everyone in the place looked so sad, even as they were piling heaps of food on their plates.  It's kind of a depressing place to be.

The food was okay and there was a lot of it.  In keeping with Aria's overall theme, the focus is mostly Asian cuisine.  Plenty of sushi, curry, noodles, dumplings and the like.  Lots of seafood options.  There was also a section for southern diner-style food like meatloaf, mashed potatoes and a carving station, but none of that looked very appetizing.  It all appeared to have been sitting out under the heat lamps for a long time.

My favorite item on the buffet was the fish n' chips presented in an adorable little frier basket.  It was actually really crispy and tasted great.  Also, I enjoyed the desserts and there was a vast selection of sweets.  The bread pudding was unexpectedly exceptional.  There were about a dozen different flavors of gelato to choose from and a large assortment of pastries and tarts.

I purchased the all-you-can-drink option for... $15?  It sounds like a decent deal, but let's be honest: most people are going to stuff themselves with food and won't really have much room for alcoholic beverages.  Plus the beer list is really bad.  The only beer that I would even consider ordering was Stella.  I had one of the bloody mary cocktails too, and it was just awful.  No flavor except for an astringent, cheap vodka.  Ick.

Rather than hitting a buffet on the strip, my preference would be to take that $50-60 and catch a cab downtown.  Around Fremont Street you can eat and drink your fill of really delicious food in a much happier atmosphere, continue the revelry all night long, and still spend less money than one trip to the buffet.  That's just a personal preference though.  If you really enjoy buffets, I guess the one at Aria is par for the course.",4,0,1

Anyway, just don't come here and waste your money.  The food was horrible.  I sampled basically everything and the only thing I liked was their gelato (I mean, if they messed that up...).  I'm not the type of person who would eat her money's worth since I'm all about quality of food.  The quality was nonexistence.

There's also soups, salad and Mexican. I think that's most of it? But probably more I'm blanking on right now. Clearly there's everything here depending on your mood. Everything I ate was solid.

Especially compared to the Bellagio next door that has the same price for lunch and dinner, the Bellagio wins without doubt.

The main reason I went was for the oysters on the half shell, but beware: the oysters were unfresh, dessicated,  and had such a strong fishy taste that I was unable to swallow them. Also they looked as if no one had touched them on the ice which made them the more unfresh. The sushi was palatable though I suspect the Aria does not hire a real sashimi chef with the sashimi being unevenly cut. 

The prime rib and the flank steak were good, although they were not seasoned particularly well to meet the standard already set by the Bellagio. As the newcomer on the block, the Aria does not make a case for itself; the Bellagio does a better job and has much more selection for the same cost. The Aria buffet resembles a cafeteria and the interior is somewhat claustrophobic.

The saving grace of this buffet is the beautiful presentation of its desserts, this could make it worth it if you are a dessert fan, although the selection is definitely less varied than that at the Bellagio. 

All in all, the Aria was digestible (apart from the oysters), but it cannot compete in the competitive buffet scene of Las Vegas.",0,0,0

The only good thing about it was our waitress who constantly brought us drinks, sometimes even when they were extra. This was one of the only positive of the night. It's bad when the best thing about a $35.99 (+18% gratuity for parties over 8 + tax) is their Indian Naan and watery hummus. 

At the start of the experience, we had to deal with the cashiers who had no idea what they were doing, with the hostess telling us to go to 1 register then the other rudely telling us we were going to the wrong one and that they needed to keep us together so we don't confuse the cashiers (even though we were the only ones in line). Another weird situation was after charging you the 18% mandatory gratuity, they hand you the cash, $12 and some change, and make you hand it to your server. Step 1, pay with credit card, step 2, receive cash, step 3, tip server. 

Once we sat, we realized there is not easy access to the rest of the buffet because we were sat in one of these stage like sections of the place, with only one exit to our pod. We were sat pretty close to the old oysters and crab legs, but the line and traffic that it came with was not worth the proximity. 

Our group pretty much came to the consensus that for that price, we'd rather eat at the Wynn or the Bellagio, or maybe go to Rio for the cheaper version. The Buffet at Aria, however, was not worth the time or money. 

If i had to give it a price, I'd say it belongs around the $15.99 price range for both the food quality as well as the overall decor and service. While our waitress was happy and attentive, it could not save the glaring problems that this buffet faces. I would probably give a few stars leniency for service only, as it was opening week\/weekend, however, food quality should not be that bad. It's not like the cooks are learning to cook on the job.

The video was recorded during the dinner rush. 

It costs 40 bucks for dinner. 

This is the only buffet I believe to have Alaskan King Crab legs on the Strip. Even Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace doesn't have King Crab Legs. They have a varieties of Sushi rolls to choose from. They even serve jumbo shrimp that I don't see at other buffets on the strip.

They even have a cool rotating Ice Cream Bar.

Overall, I have to say this Newly Renovated Buffet is definitely up to par with Wicked Spoon and Bacchanal Buffet.

The food is awful, like really awful. I will never go here and will never let my friends go either.

I tried pretty much all cuisines at their lunch buffet. EVERY SINGLE ITEM IS TERRIBLE!! including desserts (except those cake lollipops). I like the concept where you pre pay for your buffet and drinks (we can include unlimited drinks for extra charge). For table of 6, 4 of us bought unlimited (other two were already hungover from last night).
They checked our ids again at the table (I get that since two of us didn't buy they want to make sure they are not minors). They take ENOUGH time to come to the table and take drinks order (I think we had 4 almost non-alcoholic drinks (more mixers and sugar and very less alcohol) each out of 2hrs). The 1st waitress shift was over after an hour and the 2nd waitress came and checked our ids again (I get that too) and she said ""the previous waitress told me, only 3 of you on your table bought unlimited and she is checking how much time we'd left to get drinks"". I told her ""please go to the buffet frond desk, check how many of us bought and add the 20 min time you are wasting to our table for drinks"". She was like ""oh no, I trust you""!!

Chicken curry was not spicy on bit. The fresh naan and garlic naan was AWESOME! Add a little mint julep was the perfect condiment. The desserts were good. I enjoyed the cream brulee, chocolate covered strawberries and gelato. Oh and if you are a coffee drinker, order a cup of joe. My friends claim its one of the best they have tasted.

Service was slow. We had to ask for them to clear our plates and even that they took long. Selction wise its not as grand as the one in the Rio but quality wise its super good. I can't complain. I just came for the crab legs :)",0,0,0

The Buffet, along with the rest of Aria, seem immaculate. We've stayed at the Aria before and was impress with the rooms. So it would seem logical that the food was equally impressive. When I took a quick look around, the presentation of the food looked nice.

However looks can be very deceiving. I tried the orange glazed ham. It was dry with no hint of orange. The grilled vegetables were also over done. The clam chowder was ok but nothing a can of Campbell's soup cant replace. I tried the Mexican clams. It was underwhelming and the taste did not go well together. Got a couple of warm crab legs but the meat on it was rather dry. Since we came in the late afternoon we were also able to sample the dinner menu. I was actually looking forward to the King Snow Crab legs but they were equally disappointing.

The only good thing I can say about this place is that the gelato was pretty good. 

The service was a bit of a disappointment as well. Since our regular waitress couldn't be found for a good 10 minutes, I flagged down 2 passing servers asking them for the tool to crack open the crab legs. They hardly acknowledged me and as they were walking away one waiter says to the other ""Why me?"" before hesitantly coming back to get me what I needed. 

Definitely would not be back here. Living up to its name, this is THE BUFFET to avoid.",4,1,1

In general, I thought it tasted better than your average Vegas buffet.  I especially enjoyed everything from their carvery section and their whole steamed crab legs.

With the buy one get one free coupon, The Buffet at Aria is a great value and I would recommend it!

To get a free buffet pass or a 2-for-1 coupon, you need to earn points in the MyVegas app which is by MGM.  You earn gold chips for playing their games.  Once you get enough gold chips, you can use them for discounts and freebies at the MGM properties.  You need to be an Aria hotel guest to redeem anything that's completely free.  But, the 2-for-1 coupon is good for anyone to use.  Yes, even if you're not staying at Aria, you can still use the 2-for-1 coupon There are some restrictions and blackout dates so make sure you read the fineprint.  So once you redeem it, you have to go to the Total Rewards booth to get your coupon.

By the way, why does everyone name their buffet, The Buffet.
- The Buffet at Wynn
- The Buffet at Bellagio
- The Buffet at Stratosphere

Anyways, I came for their weekday dinner which was $38 a person.
With the coupon, it comes out to $19 a person, which makes it a great deal

When you pay, they give you a menu which shows you add-ons you can get
- Unlimited alcohol for $19.99
- 3lb Lobster for $55
- Fish of the Day for $35
- Or a dozen oysters for $26

I don't understand why someone would come to a buffet and fill their stomach with food you have to pay extra for, but it's here if you are craving them.

- 18% automatic gratuity for 8 or more
- There's a nice restroom inside the buffet
- And stay away from the asian food",8,3,5

The Aria is so unapologetically expensive coupled with the fact that it is actually laid-out to make money that you come to the buffet just looking for a good deal.
The reason you will pick the buffet for breakfast is bc there is no coffee makers in the rooms, no place to buy a coffee besides starbucks, and the line for starbucks EVERY MORNING is about 25-45 min. It literally wraps around the outside of the store. If you do get your coffee here its about 2 bucks more then any other starbucks. So you go looking for the buffet bc you are almost going to spend that much picking up some drinks and a few light snacks.

The buffet will have a line but its a line for food, right? The staff is not cheerful, the waitress's were talking about personal business while deciding where to sit us. Thats never bothered me before but we stood there for awhile while they chatted. The server was SHOCKED that I would ask for coffee AND a coke?! 
The Aria bills there buffet as being special ""a new kind of way to buffet"" or something? because they have international stations. THIS IS NOT NEW ARIA.

Some of the international offerings at breakfast are a huge station for dim sum, egg rolls, chinese food (same every morning) hummus, babaganoush, the cucumber sauce, flat bread - all average. Like the stuff you get at the olive bar at a grocery store, maybe even less flavorful. No one was really eating it.

There is enough breakfast options to leave you really happy the first day. But by the second day you will be trying to find something new. So like me, maybe you will try the beautiful salad bar. 3 different types of lettuce mixes, 3 choices of dressings, and a man to spin it in a bowl for you... Until you get to the topping choices, garbanzo beans? canned beets? The only thing I could find to put on my salad was carrots! No fresh cut veggies, no nuts, only blue cheese. It was so weird. The shrimp was good but the cocktail sauce was not fresh. The one mussel I got to try had an enormous barnacle inside so I passed on that. I did eat a lot of bagels and lox but I know a small part of the population are into smoked salmon for breakfast because I happen to be a chef.

Overall I used to be in charge of the buffet at a 4 star hotel in Texas and  our buffet was far better. Made to order omelets, some kind of roast with a sauce (they have roasted chicken with brown gravy that was dry), a bunch of different premade mixed salads with fresh veggies and marinades. 

But again, if you dont come to the breakfast buffet you will spend as much or more at the Aria Cafe\/room service\/ or the hellacious starbucks with the 25 min line and spiked prices. 

So enjoy the buffet!",2,3,1

Most dishes are well prepared and of good quality with flavors well balanced and the selection is a bit differentiated from standard buffet fare (e.g. garlic and herb naan and pepperoni pizza bagels). We were there for the brunch buffet and my husband says the cured and carved meat selections were quite tasty and the food stations are done in a visually appealing manner.

The room is spacious and open with plenty of filtered light and view of the pool area and trees; it's part of the Aria's ""promenade venues"" and continues the theme of plentiful filtered light, modern decor and open space. Thing is though, the buffet room gets a bit too loud (compared to other buffets, such as the Wynn) which takes away a bit from the upscale ambiance the place is supposed to have.

Hint for Vdara guests: don't take the tram and try to get there via the Crystals & Aria's main entrance. There's no need to trek through the smokey Aria casino, you can just walk out the Vdara lobby, across Harmon on the walk way over the street and into the Aria lobby.

As far as the breakfast went, they had everything I can think of just about with the exception of grits( I'm not complaining though). I went to the station where you can have your own omelet made, that was very good. I love the selection of breakfast meats, bacon, sausage, ham, etc. The waffles were actually THE BOMB!!!!.  

I made it a point to try every station they had, which meant I had to pace myself, and not clear my plate :0(   I did enjoy the bay scallops service.

The prices aren't low (but what IS cheap in Vegas :D?) - $20 for breakfast, $30 for lunch and $35 for dinner buffet. And if you like to get drunk in the morning, for bottomless alcoholic beverages you must add another $13. The staff is really good in managing guest, as there is always a lot of people there, but lines are up to 10 minutes at most. Breakfast selection is great - a lot of eggs in different forms (the omelet guy is a wizard, I tell you!), pizza, asian rolls, toast, sausages, cereals, skillets, make-your-own-salad station and many many other things. Even crab legs and other seafood, I never knew people eat that for breakfast. Everything was warm and tasty. Dinner there was a bit worse. I imagine it's a mix of breakfast and lunch food. It was good but nothing special. I tried some meats and different kinds of fish and there always was something slightly wrong with it. But the pasta guy is awesome (i think it's the same person that makes omelets!). His dishes are simply wonderful, especially with Alfredo sauce. Mmm. There is also a corner with beautifully made desserts and pastries. I tried a few and they were good, but nothing above average. However, I simply adored the Peanut Butter Gellato. I have eaten it every single day after breakfast or dinner or both :). 

All in all, I would recommend this place for breakfast, especially with the family, as I imagine even the most choosy kid will find something to eat there. As for dinner or lunch, I suppose there is a lot of better places to try, even in the ARIA alone.",4,0,3

Several reviews and sites state that on Sunday, the Aria offers a champagne brunch. This is partially true. When you arrive, you pay the $30.99 plus tax for the buffet. After seated, you are offered the ""opportunity"" to add the champagne - $16.99 plus tax for unlimited. So if expecting a champagne buffet, this one will set you back $48 plus tax and tip.

We arrived at 2:15 and asked FOR A SEAT NEAR A WINDOW WITH A POOL VIEW.

The food was average. The prime rib was good. The shrimp was victim to sitting too long at room temp - mushy. The paella was simply dreadful. I took 3 bites - all 3 included shells from crab. Definitely skip this! The gelato was decent - however, the oreo-type cookie I also had was quite tasteless, although it looked like it should be great.

Then came the worst part of the experience. After being there 30 minutes or so, the blinds were lowered so there was no longer a view outside. We asked it be raised as we specifically asked for a table with an outside view. It was raised a couple of feet. A few minutes later, it was again lowered to the sill. I asked for a manager. She ""explained"" someone complained that they were bothered by the sun. I asked that it be raised to just above eye level so we could enjoy our view. The manager declined. She told us we could move. ???????????? Why not ask the guests that came in after we did, and who do not want an outside view to move???????? 

ok - so we moved so we could continue to enjoy the outside view. While finishing our dessert, we were brought our bill and asked to pay at that time for our champagne. No - we could not finish our dessert first, we needed to produce our credit card and pay-up.

I am convinced this was age-discrimination on the part of the manager. She felt we, as seniors, should ""go quietly into the night"". That was quite apparent during our conversation and her ""talking down"" to us.

Well - guess what - that's not going to happen. I will do whatever I can to share our unpleasant experience with the Aria.

(Note that we stayed at the Aria in July - 2 months prior to this visit. We had a terrific experience at that time.)

There are many buffet options in Las Vegas. My strong suggestion is to find one elsewhere.

You can have any kinda pasta made which is a delicious carb nightmare. The desserts always seem so fancy but they also have an ice cream and gelato bar! That with homemade cookies or either bread pudding and cobbler hits it home. 

Service:
This is hit and miss. Sometimes you can be seated in an area where the waitress is cool and attentive. There are other times when you have to go on a search and rescue mission just to get a drink refill.

It was very buttery.  Some of the other dishes tasted fine just not quite what you would expect them to taste like.  There was certainly a large selection with stations from Asian to Pizza to Indian to Diner.

Before last night, I had never left a buffet hungry.  The quality of the food is the reason for my rating.  Not one single dish was worth a second taste.  It was more on par with Golden Corral than a high end Vegas buffet.

My specific issues:

-The king crab legs were still partially frozen.  Any thick part was a solid crabsicle.
-The snow crab legs must have been salted after they were cut open.  It was like eating a salt lick.
-The crawfish were completely unseasoned - just boiled.  Do you know what unseasoned crawfish taste like?  Mud!  That's why southerners Cajun them up!
-The paella, one of my favorite dishes, was a complete disaster.  It was both overcooked AND cold, they didn't rinse the clams ahead of time so there was a sandy grit to it, and I'm fairly certain the rice was dyed yellow with food coloring, because there was zero taste of saffron.
-The lamb was very dry
-The grilled prawns were burnt. This was not just a one-off mistake, I waited for 2 other batches to be taken by others before actually taking one myself, and it was exactly as rubbery as I had feared.
-The sushi rice was very old and dry
-The dim sum, while edible, was a far cry from authentic

I would say the dessert station is the best feature of this buffet, but it's nothing special.  All the desserts are adequate, but nothing I couldn't make myself and certainly nothing memorable or worth the extravagant price charged.

The only redeeming factor was the service.  My waitress refilled my drinks with the speed and stealth of a ninja, and the bus staff was also very prompt in removing used plates.  I wish I could have taken my $43 back from the register and given it to them.

Bottom line - if you want high end buffet and want to pay a lot for it, both Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon are orders of magnitude better than Aria.  If you want a low quality feed trough, the food here is right but the price is not.",0,0,0

For me, this was probably the best buffet I have ever been to. A little pricey but you get what you pay for. And what you get are RIDICULOUS options for your evening of buffeting and phenomenal customer service. We came in for a late dinner on Saturday night and were pleasantly surprised. First off, the decor and ambiance is modern and sleek, with a touch of home-cooked feel throughout. For example, the plates at each station were in fun home-cooked\/already used looking pans and plates which made it feel as if you were grabbing some food from your mom's pots and pans back at home. The place didn't feel or look snooty or too fancy at all. One of the best parts of our experience here was the customer service. Our server was so attentive, clearing plates AS SOON as we were done and bringing us refills when we were half done with our current drinks. And our section was completely packed too! We were very impressed. The food was delicious. Macaroni and cheese was one of my top eats of the night! I went back for seconds and thirds for sure. Same with the mozzarella\/spinach pizza. WOW, I've never had pizza that good at a buffet before. I thoroughly enjoyed the Indian cuisine. The chicken Masala was as good as I've had it at an Indian restaurant, but the naan was a little dry and tasteless. The Chow Fun was delicious, and the chicken potstickers were good too. On my last round, I realized that they had a sandwich bar that I completely missed with delicious looking options. The dessert bar was AMAZING! They had delicious gelato\/icecream that was to die for! The red velvet whoopie was good! I got a pudding pie of some sort that was the best thing I had from the desserts.

First time a couple months ago..I had dining credits so I decided to take my mum here for a meal. The most memorable was the curry tri-tip.. mmm. 

Recent experience... ECK! 
This time I had two comped buffets that came with the room. 
We went for brunch and found a bug in my noodle salad!! Although tiny.. a BUG with little wings and legs! 

So we notified our server and he supposedly in turn notified the manager and got the chefs to throw the dish out. 

About 10 minutes pass and the server came back to tell us that the dish had been thrown out. OK. 

Now sitting there disgusted, with an appetite that had ran 1000 miles away and only 1\/2 a dish into the buffet we waited expecting a manager to come apologize at the very least. Nope. 

We ask to speak with the manager and the server responded with ""You want to see the manager? Is there a problem? Was it that LITTLE bug? (making a tiny gesture with his thumb and forefinger)"" -- YES THERE IS A PROBLEM! Just because I didn't technically pay for the brunch- because it was comped - doesn't mean that I don't want a ""refund"" for a meal I didn't eat! Thinking of the people who paid $25 for a brunch and get treated poorly. (They had no reason to believe my buffet was comped since it was charged to the room.. for all they know I'm paying for it) 

So I politely although agitated said ""Yes I would like to see your manager and yes because of that LITTLE bug"". So seriously, am I only granted an apology from the manager if the bug were over an inch big or what is the rule??!! 

Another 10 minutes pass and the server returns with the manager who totally ignores us and speaks to the server right in-front of our table ""Where's the bug? In the trash? Did you see the bug? so there was a bug? It was a TINY bug? What dish was it on? Are you sure so-and-so saw it?"" 
WOW! 
1- I thought he showed the manager about 20 minutes ago when he took my napkin in which was a noodle piece where the bug had rested. 
2- I said I wanted to speak to the manager and by her actions she had no intention of speaking to me! 

I interrupt their little banter of whether we were telling the truth or trying to scam them out of $25 worth of bacon and eggs. She doesn't even ask me what I wanted to speak with her about and reaches for the receipt on our table. She then says ""I don't know what I can do. It's been one hour since you started your meal"" (Yeah I spent 40 minutes waiting for your slow ass!!). But also said reluctantly that ""ok I will issue you a refund for one of your meals."" ONE. 

Although we were both only half dish into our buffet and had both lost our appetites now not only due to the little pesky bug that I had to unfortunately notice and not blindly ingest as the manager would have rathered. She would like to issue a refund of ONE meal because apparently my companion- who in his hunger finished his noodles before I saw the bug in mine - would have an appetite to continue with his meal. 

I pointed out that we had both lost our appetites and hardly hate 1\/2 a plate of anything and she blankly said no, she'll only refund one and walked away to process it. She came back and placed the receipt back on our table with a ""It has been refunded back to your room"", turned and walked off. 

In examining the receipt.... she had refunded the full amount! WTF..... 
Whatever... so we stood up, walked out and got her name at the cashier. Dree. 

Honestly, it's not a bad buffet. They serve snow crab legs for brunch\/lunch and king crab legs with multiple meats for dinner. Just pray that you won't have to deal with their nonexistent customer service!! 

Verdict: 
- Only for dinner.. their gourmet dinner also comes with 1\/2 a lobster tail 
- Bringing my magnifying spectacles (seriously... it will never be a comfortable meal here ever again)",3,2,2

I go back to what I usually say about LV strip buffets... some people aren't going to agree... but... if you're thinking about eating at one...head to the Bellagio, and EAT THERE.

Aria buffet is OK.  But we had dinner on a Sat Nite which was about $40 per person with tax & tip (YES you still tip at the LV buffets) and was NOT worth it.  We don't drink, so the unlimited wine didn't come into play.  The lobster was downright bad, tasteless and dry.  Crab legs were fresh, decent enough...some poeple were just eating those and nothing else.

We had the displeasure of butting heads with the seedier element of Vegas right there in the crab line.  Some hill-billy woman was holding things up, just standing there with no one in front of her.  We politely asked if she was in fact in line - and she got all bent out of shape.  You know the type - fat with the K-Mart shorts exposing legs no one should see, clumps of greasy dirt-blond strands for hair and big, dull neo-biker tattoos on her arms.  How these people get in places like the Aria, who knows.  The buffet probably needs the business.  Anyway...

I gave Buffet at Aria 3 stars for its OK quality.  Plus, the people who work there DO work hard.  I won't  deny them that.  I say that, despite the fact that the cashier was, well, sort of abrasive we felt and the hostesses didn't really seem to have it together.  People were being seated from 2 lines (not the VIP line) and there seemed to be no order to it.  People were getting upset.

GOOD (my favs): Lobster tails, prime rib, chocolate covered strawberries

BAD: Service

- I notice that none of the reviews mention the LOBSTER so i assume that's new, but that made it all worthwhile.  Without it, I'd probably agree that this buffet might not be the best bang for your buck in vegas. They also had crab legs, shrimp, and mussels.

- Prime rib was really good. They had flavored skirt steak as well along with several other meats (pork, roast beef... don't remember all)

- Took FOREVER for our server to take away the plates.  They just had ONE person waiting on our table so it would take a while for her to get around to all the tables.  They should just have anyone passing by take away the dirty plates but they only had our ONE server do it. That was our only complaint. My husband also thought the lighting was too bright (like a cafeteria) but i didn't mind it.

- True that they don't have a bunch of different pastas or ""filler"" dishes that many other buffets may have but they have the important stuff (meats & seafood) that I look for.

For the past 5 years as a resident of Vegas, I've tried nearly all of the buffets in town, including during the holidays.

Dinner tonight, 12\/22\/15, was priced at $48.99 a person for the holidays. Not a single entree dish was palatable. From lamb to pork belly, poutine to pho, every dish was lukewarm. All the meats were tough & the dishes were flavorless. I don't eat shellfish, but my mil does. She didn't eat some on her plate because she said it tasted off.

Service was spotty - I was consistently out of water & I piled our dirty plates on an empty table because they didn't come by often.

Bathroom in buffet was horrendous. Overflowing trash, empty soap dispenser, sanitary bin in stall so stuffed that the lid couldn't shut, no paper seat liners & a terrible smell was the icing on the cake.

There was a short line when we got there and it was moving slooooooow, but then we found it was due to a big party ahead of us and they were just in that slow moving zone.  Once they dispersed to their table, the line went quick.  We got seated and there were still a lot of tables empty so it had to have been that family that was holding up the line.  Anyway, i digress...

It must be great to be a brand new state-of-the-art casino\/hotel designer and have an open budget to design to your heart's content.  I would love to have that job.  The decor was very nice but I could see it being a little dated in a few years.  It was pretty chic but wasn't cutting edge to me.  Oh well, it was nice and it had the new car smell still.

Once you get a load of the spread here, you will be wondering how they can afford to only charge $15.  You can't get that price unless you go to smaller or more remote hotels.   There are better buffets with way more selection but for more money.  Don't get me wrong, I don't mind paying more for quality, but for breakfast, I'd rather pay less for a smaller buffet with quality items and not feel like I had to eat more to cover the cost of a more expensive joint.    Really, who wants to pay $25 for breakfast in LV.

The few items that stood out for me were the selection of sausages that they had and the array of salame, olives, and cheeses they offered.  Also, their desserts looked pretty tasty and they offered a lot of sugar free options, which is good for any diabetics in the house.

One thing I would improve is the omelet bar area.  They need to provide a better area or something because the people didn't know which was the line started and they were clogging up the aisles and blocking some food areas.

The service was great.  My drinks were never empty and if they were, they always asked if we needed more juice\/coffee\/milk\/water.  

I would try this place out again, especially if I decide to stay at the Aria next time.  Seems like a nice place to crash and give my money to.  It's right in the middle of everything and there's a shuttle to the Monte Carlo\/NYNY.    Worth a try.",2,0,1

From sushi and Asian dishes, to Mexican favorites and seafood, you really can sample food offerings from across the globe. Your typical American faire is here too, with sandwiches, cheeseburgers, etc. But why eat that when you can have crab legs?! They have a plentiful fruit selection, and a great dessert area complete with ice cream by the scoop. 

I left this buffet feeling completely satisfied, and would come back in a heartbeat. I would point out that the line can be a drag, especially when you can see large sections of tables available. We got in line and were maybe 40 people back, and it seemed to take about 30 minutes. So come early, and be patient :)

I'm also a fan of the simple decor here, and the layout. Its multilevel, which is more interesting and deflects the sound better than one big room with table after table. There are also huge windows nearby that look to the pool, which gives the buffet welcome ambient light.

Also if you don't intend on drinking more than 2 beverages from the bottomless well, just go ahead and pass on that. Not worth the extra 12 bucks in my opinion.

This is far from accessible. You have to walk all the way through Bally's casino floor to the front entrance where we were greeted with 120 degree heat and escalators that didn't work. Then up and across the street to the Bellagio, then all the way through the Bellagio casino floor to the opposite side to the tram that takes you to Crystals.

Saw the dim sum first, so got a sui mai and two har gow. Sui mai was a little dense, but the har gow was pretty good. The shrimp inside very plump. Got a piece of proscuitto and some mini mozzerella balls, both were good. There was a bowl of olives (and I love olives) but they were all too hard.

Then I turned and saw all this seafood! Snow crab legs were cut open for easy eating. The leg sections were actually pretty sweet. The body sections were more bland and watery. Peel and eat shrimp small but nice and plump. Green lipped mussels and smaller black mussels (green ones were better), and some crawfish (bland).

2nd plate:
I didn't realize they had warm crab, crawfish, and other shellfish just on the other side, so I got those as well. I actually preferred the cold crab legs bc the warm ones were dried out. Same with the crawfish. They had green mussels in a lemongrass broth that was pretty good.

Then there were the standard CA roll type sushi. Not bad. The only one that had fish in it was the Philly roll.

On the other side of this island they have soups that they serve in Le Creuset cookware--fancy! I tried the clam chowder. Tasted good, but the problem is the pots don't heat up the soup as well as the traditional soup pots they use in buffets.

3rd plate:
This was what I was waiting for at this buffet. The Indian food! The naan was really good; thin and chewy at the ""point"", and soft and fluffy at the ""crust"". The curries were pretty good but I could have liked them a bit more spicy. The chicken was my favorite. The basmati rice was nice and firm. I hate mushy rice. I'd pass on the dolmades and falafel. Dolmades was mushy, and falafel was too hard and dry.

4th plate:
Finally I get to the carving station! The Portuguese sausage was my favorite. Probably all time favorite sausage, ever. It has a nice texture, with thin casing, and not too salty. The pork belly was very soft, but the skin was not crunchy. I didn't try the beef, but it was a huge hunk of beef and they called it a beef steamship.

I thought I needed some salad, so over to the salad bar. My favorite was the persimmon and pomegranate salad. I always thought I hated persimmon, so I decided to try it again. It's good! It's like a cross between an apple and melon. My mom used to force me to eat over ripened persimmon when I was a child and I guess that's why I thought I hated it. Still to this day I cannot eat over ripped fruit. This persimmon had a nice light crunch to it.

They also have small sandwiches, and I chose the grilled veggie one. I love eggplant. It had grilled eggplant, avocado, and caramelized onion. I just ate the insides with the Portuguese sausage and it was a great match.

5th plate:
Now I'm about to explode.
A slice of white pizza with spinach, where I added sun dried tomatoes and proscuitto. So good! The pizza wasn't even hot but the crust was crunchy! How do they do it? Even with all the oil and cheese, and even the very first bite that is usually the softest, soggiest part of a pizza was crunchy.

And had to get another piece of naan and some more salad. Love me some naan bread.

6th plate:
Dessert
I'm not a huge sweets person, so I really appreciate when places have creme brulee, panna cotta, and similar bc they aren't too sweet. No creme brulee, but they did have panna cotta. I didn't like the berry topping, but the custard was good. Bf said the cheesecake was a lot richer than usually but still good (too rich to finish though), and the mint chocolate ice cream was as you would expect. They have a ton of ice cream flavors, but no soft serve and no cones.

Overall, food was pretty good. Staff kept the place really clean. Food was always coming out. Our server was like a ghost. Everytime we came back to our table, our glasses were refilled and our plates were taken away. Def will return when I get another BOGO voucher.",10,2,2

The selection is okay, not as much as I would have wanted for the price. They do offer a wide range of seafood though including snow crab and king crab.

The lobster was fresh and very tasty albeit small. The wine was decent as well. I opted for Chardonnay because of the seafood. 

The crab legs were decent but it was a pain to get the meat out so I highly suggest grabbing an entire plate (yes, entire plate) of just the crab legs first just to make sure you get your fill. The shrimp were fresh too but the 'sushi' was NOT good. I was definitely disappointed by that.

The other highlight was the New York Strip, quite tasty as well. The prime rib was good but nothing better than any other prime I've had, I'm not really a prime rib fan anyhow.

The major highlight for me was the deserts, they were all very good so it was a great way to cap off the meal. Oh, and my buddy swears he loves the pizza.

All-in-all I will not go back to this buffet but there's no reason I would tell someone not to eat here if you think buffets are logical choices for places to eat.

I am happy to say since the revamp, the quality has improved. I think that they took a look a whats up the road at the Bacchanal and decide to copy the quality vs quantity theory. 

We came here on a Friday night at 6. I expected the line to be insane because of the Zarkana crowd but nope, not a single person in line so there was really no need to break out the M-Life balla status card.

Updates from the previous experience:

They now offer 2 carving stations with various cuts of meat. Much improved prime rib and briskets from the last time. 

Indian\/ Middle-east station
Fresh Naan! I didn't come here for Indian curry but it was on point with most Indian lunch buffet's that surround the strip. 

Asian
Lots of dim sum selections but note, again I didn't come here for that however I did grab a set of char Siu Bao and shumai. They were decent but a little dried out since they were in the steamer racks for a while. 

Kalbi (Korean Short Ribs) were decent BUT.. Beware of bone fragments!! The meat was not cleaned well when it was cut. I ended up finding several fragments stuck on the meat.

On the first day we ate here, we got here just before dinnertime but only paid for brunch and was able to enjoy some of the dinner foods they brought out.
I was really craving some meat that day and got the prime rib. I was hugely disappointed to find that it was tough, overcooked and dry. 
My favorite item was the smoked salmon. 
The chicken sausage was also great; the frittata that comes in the mini cast iron skillet was okay but a bit salty. The mashed potato was plain. The eel sushi was good. My boyfriend was a huge fan of the crab legs. 
I didn't try any dessert due to a gluten allergy but my boyfriend liked the pistachio gelato.
When dinner came around, we heard that they had lamb leg and I got a piece of that and was disappointed yet again; it too was tough, overcooked and dry.
I also got some raw oysters which were pretty good. 

The next day, the line was longer when we got there but it still moved relatively fast. I tried their scrambled eggs which were bomb-diggity. I got some more smoked salmon of course, as well as the chicken sausage. They also had some cooked veggies (zucchini, yellow squash and carrots) which were great. I tried one of their proscuitto and it tasted horrible. I think I remember telling my boyfriend it tasted like soap. It was so bad that I spit it out into a napkin.

ZERO!  Thanks to my husband's inability to wait 5 minutes once he's hungry and our friends who would rather spend their cash on beverages, rather than food.

So Aria's buffet was our Friday night dinner.  With unlimited wine and a lobster for every two people, $36 sounded like a pretty good deal.  Unfortunately, since we never made it back to our hotel room the night before, I was not at my best for eating.

The buffet had just about everything.  Multiple carving stations that included lamb, turkey, New York steak, pork tenderloin, and prime rib.  I had none of that, so I can't comment other than to say my companions were pleased.  Seafood options included crab legs, shrimp and oysters among other things.  

The ""free"" lobster was a mess.  Our order was lost, so there was a long delay, and it was NOT worth the wait.  It was so overcooked, it was like chewing on a piece of rubber.

The buffet was reasonably priced (for Vegas) at around $24 a person with the option to add unlimited alcoholic beverages for $12.99.

As I walked in, the buffet area looked pretty nice, but what really impressed me was the presentation of all the food items.  I mean, beautiful.  Unfortunately, it didn't taste the way it looked.  The food just didn't taste great.  The shrimp on ice, tasted a little funky, not sure if it was off, or just ...I don't know, but not good.  Omelet, was just ok, but they didn't have a huge selection of fillings for the omelet like at the other higher end hotels.  

Very little fresh fruit.  Chinese food portion was totally lame, over cooked, soggy.

Wait staff, was slow as well.

Oh, one thing that was very good, was the dessert section.  It looked great, and tasted great as well.  Another thing that was amazing was their sugar free chocolate cookie, amazing.

We went around 4 in the afternoon (that was already their dinner time). It was pretty dead. But we're talking about a good dozen of tables were filled at the time. But that's understandable because that's super early for dinner anyways. I have to say it's not a bad thing cause we haven't had a meal all day so we were hungry and no line up. That's already a bonus. 

The food was kinda meh even when I was super hungry. That was surprising to me. I don't know if I had high hopes or something or did it really not stand out for me. What threw me off was the shrimps. It said peeled shrimps. So, of course you expect them to be peeled already and ready to be eaten. That wasn't the case. There were still shells on them and it look like the chef just put a cut down the middle so it would make it easier to peel off the shells. Which I thought was funny. The shrimps were kinda small too. Variety of food was alright. Enough for us to choose from or sample from. The dessert is always my favourite and I love how they have a variety of gelato to choose from. 

Service was kinda meh. Our server may have been a bit old and had some hearing problems or something cause we had to repeat ourselves over and over again. Oh and we found a rotten lemon in our drink. Don't think it was the servers fault considering the lemon looked fine on the outside till you looked inside the lemon. 

I don't think this buffet would be one I would recommend to others when they are in Vegas considering there are more on the strip to try out. But if you are lazy and you live in this hotel then sure give this place a try. My friends did say their prime ribs were really good. My piece was just slightly chewy for my liking.",0,1,0

You can spend more elsewhere for less satisfying food.

I was with 4 others who also didn't want to look further, needless to stay buffet was not my first choice and especially this one, I never get my money's worth.  But when hunger strikes you'll eat anything, and we were so hungry buffet sounded good at the time.  
Located at Aria's promenade.  It was about $35 per adult for late lunch.  The place is nice, clean, modern, and staff very efficient.  They selection of food was the downfall for me.  I did a walk through before starting, looked pretty good.  Its when I actually started to select food when I thought wow this is not great, my plate was pretty empty.  
Buffets I always start with my main dishes.  I went to the craving station got a prime rib and a small slice of leg of lamb, both ok leg of lamb was dry but prime rib was good.  Other options sausages, roasted chicken, and turkey.  I added some side dishes I went to the ""Italian"" section and grabbed some antipasto.  Again nothing special.  Went back to my seat.  Started with that.  
They had salad bar, which I usually ignore at buffets but I made a small side salad just to get some veggies in. Italian with a made to order past bar,  pizza so on I skipped, small Indian section about 3 dishes, I grabbed a naan bread and topped it with butter chicken not even worth mentioning, an Asian section with not very appetizing dim sum, dry looking noddles, and the rice even looked sad I skipped this whole section.  They had a ""sushi"" section with 3 different types of roll, this was very disappointing.  The seafood section looked pretty promising crab legs, mussels, prawns so on both hot or cold.  This section is where you'd get your money's worth.  I tried some of the warm seafood salty but was good.  Warm butter was a nice touch.  The dessert bar with its many options of ice cream, cookies, pies, and cakes.  Non really made me happy left me feeling wanting more, and not a feeling you want after a buffet.  I decided to have more fruits instead, watermelon and pineapple where great.  With the many options of a buffet in Vegas this is in the bottom of my list.  And to top it all off 2 people in my group had some type of food poisoning, I guess being picky with my food selection worked out because I felt ok.",1,1,2
1458994,p1SYxTcVxwdcGMSrfrd7vg,4LB8M_WhBF-JofVNy8wXTQ,LR0qF0FEVsCOhYWUOiH26A,3,2015-03-05,"Firstly, let me begin this review by stating how I judged this establishment. I looked at it as a buffet, meaning that you can't expect stellar service and world-class dishes but at the same time it's at Aria, meaning you would expect a little more than your average $8-all-you-can-eat extravaganza. That said, going off of these rough judging ""guidelines"", I have to say that The Buffet at Aria fell a little short of what I expected. 

Now, let's start the actual review with the pricing. So we get there expecting to pay roughly $30 a head for lunch ($23-$25 +taxes). The lady asks how many of us is it and then begins ringing the first person up and it's like almost $50. Cool. There is an option to add unlimited alcoholic drinks for $12.99 so I figure she took it upon herself to imagine that we wanted that option and that once the taxes were added, that was the total. I just thought I would confirm that that's where the price came from before I paid. Nope, that wasn't the case. She explained that the base price was more because it was Chinese New Year and that there was an extra charge because there were eight of us at a table. We said ok, well we don't need to pay extra to be at one long table after paying extra for the New Year , we can just have two tables of four next to one another (the restaurant was not very busy at all). Nope, not an option. She explained that we would either be at a table of eight or be on opposite sides of the restaurant (she did all but say deliberately). Ok ma'am, you wanna play it like that, take the extra dollars and sit us together. It should be noted that we got to The Buffet after a wonderful morning at the hotel's spa which was well worth the considerable amount of money spent. That said, we had no problem spending roughly $50 a head for a buffet after the money spent at the spa but it was the principal that we took issue with. 

Nevertheless, we were starved and once we got seated at our banquet table for eight, we went straight for the food. I started at the carving station which probably wasn't my greatest move given my feelings towards the staff from my encounter with the lady on the register. The man at the carving station acted like he had been there for two days straight without food or water - he was so notably unpleasant. That was the last bad encounter that I had with staff as the wait staff were all nice. 

Ok, so about the food. As for the selection, there seemed to be no stone left unturned. There was cuisine from all corners of the globe with an assortment of dishes at each station. I really don't think there is any way to try them all, even though I would have liked to. Notable finds were the chicken in the Chinese section, the waffles, the pizza and of course the desserts. The salad bar was also extremely extensive all on its own. I would say that the quality of the food was pretty good in general. There were a few things that were a little lackluster like the American\/ comfort food section (which is disappointing because I love that so much) but on average I would say the food was a good for buffet food. 

One positive that is worth mentioning is the physical space. It is very bright, airy and spacious. I would say it surpasses other buffets in this area because it had a much better layout and therefore atmosphere than others that I've been to. A lot of time there are people bumping into one another and the place itself just feels like a jambalaya of people and food scents but this was not like that at all. I would go as far as to say that the physical space and atmosphere was the best part of the experience for me. 

Overall, it was ok for what it was. I would suggest it if you're with a large group of people who all have different tastes and you happen to be at Aria, but I wouldn't go out of my way as I understand that most of the hotels have a buffet. If you're at Aria with a smaller group, I'd suggest trying one of their other restaurants as I know the hotel has better food offerings.",2,4,2

Good: 
- No wait (although this was on a Monday)
- Breakfast choices were surprisingly good - large variety of sausages and meats and such.  Bonus points for having chorizo burritos. 
- Prime rib was perfectly done.
- Fresh crab, shrimp, and oysters. 
- Great tasting (and rich) desserts. 

Bad: 
- Service was pretty lousy.  It took forever to get our drinks (coffee and sodas) and even that got messed up.  I think our waiter was more hung over than we were.

Waitstaff was arguing about who had which table, no one took our drinks for over ten minutes, and when they did they forgot what we ordered. The pork loin at the carving station tasted like little smokies, the carne asada was dry and didn't have any seasoning, the sushi rolls were sticky and had some unidentifiable mushy fish product, the tortellini tasted like spagetti o's ,  the crab (how can anyone mess up crab!?!?)  was so soggy that when gently squeezed water poured onto the plate, and the shrimp cocktail was old and mushy.

In general, none of the food really wowed me; even the brunch items like eggs benedict looked uncooked and unappetizing. Saving grace for the Aria buffet? One word: GELATO. The other desserts were ok, but I could have eaten 10 cups of gelato. A coworker told me the gelato they serve at the Aria buffet is the same at Jean Philippe's, I don't know if it's true, but the gelato was the best part of the buffet. I tried pistachio, coffee, some triple berry thing, and one more fruit one I forget now. All good. 

After this last trip to Vegas, I think I have come to realize that I do not like the buffets, and I'd rather go to a sit-down venue and eat\/savor my food. Granted, some buffets are good, but oftentimes, I come out feeling like I just stuffed my face for the sake of stuffing my face, and that's never a good feeling.

Came in for dinner on Sunday and expecting a WOW experience since the price tag was ~$39.  This was NOT worth it.  I thought a buffet was all about dining debauchery with vast selections of food bound to please the most discriminating palate.  I did not find one item I went back for a second helping.  Food was served on the warm side.

The selections were so limited I memorized what THE BUFFET had:

Chinese:  veggie chow mein (so bland), mongolian beef-ish item, spare rib, siu mai and pork bun.  A few cold chinese-ish salads.  (Seriously?? that's all you can come up with?)

Italian:  2 pasta dishes, a pasta bar, and 3 types of pizza.  WTH?

Indian:  Naan, paneer, bland and spice-less tandoori chicken, chicken curry.

Carving station:  Salmon, beef\/pork ribs, lamb, prime rib

Chilled Seafood:  King Crab, jumbo shrimp.  

The only 2 things that I gave a star for was the desserts and the prime rib.  The food here was very bland, few choices, and way to expensive.  If you're paying close to $40 for a buffet, may I suggest:  Wicked Spoon or Wynn's buffet.

One unique thing about this buffet is that they have a section of middle eastern cuisine with curry, hummus, and naan. I don't really like that kind of food though... Especially not in the morning.

There is a custom omelet bar. What I thought was weird was that there were dollar bills\/tips laying on the counter. Uh shouldn't they be in a jar or something to keep it sanitary? And why are people tipping the omelet man when we already paid for our meal and that's his job...? Idk.

For under $30 for dinner, you have access to UNLIMITED crab legs. Both snow AND king. That alone makes it worth it. I had four plates of it, and could have gone on but 1) exerted control; 2) decided that I was not a pig despite appearances; 3) wanted to have a taste of something else.
The meat carving section is impressive and offers prime rib, chicken, turkey, lamb and what not. I was not in a meat-y mood and just gave it a quick look but if you are a serious carnivore - that's your place.

The salads are phenomenal. Really.",4,2,2

Well, we were disappointed to say the least. There werent a lot of choices. What was out on the floor wasnt that great. 

It wasnt all bad. The dessert was super delish and the presentation was out of a 5 star restaurant. And the staff for the most was very attentive and super nice. And we found the Naan to be superb! 

Price point was alright. Except for their fancy Dinner on Thur-Sun. About $46 bucks gets you lobster for two and unlimited wine. They can keep their wine and lobster should have been thrown back into the sea. Bc it looked small, over cooked, and just downright tasteless. I didnt have it as I feared for Poseidon's wrath for eating too much of his sea family already throughout our stay. Sorry little shrimpies but you are too yummy. 

But we came for the food. The food was blah at best. So sad for a hotel that screams ""opulence, i has it"" as you walk through the front doors!",3,2,0

Here's a few pointers from this buffet expert:
1. Potstickers are great, rest of the Asian hot dishes can be skipped.
2. Sushi is good, somehow the smoked salmon next to it isn't.
3. Carving station: the ham and turkey are the big winners, ro.ast beef leaves a lot to be desired
4. Skip the Mexican section, surprisingly bland.
5. NO PIZZA IF YOU ARE PAST PUBERTY! Except you may take a slice of the green pizza with the egg to satisfy your curiosity.
6. Crab legs are conveniently pre-cut, so its okay to load up on them since you won't be wasting time trying to crack them.
7. Salads are for chicks.
8. The desserts are served in tiny portions, that can only mean they intend for you to try as many of them as possible!",5,4,3

The Buffet at Aria is my second favorite buffet behind The Buffet at Bellagio (which BTW, is a short tram ride from Aria). The Buffet at Aria is smaller than Bellagio with fewer choices, but (and it is a BIG BUT), the selections of food are great! They have exactly what I like to eat and I'm happy to eat everything they have. The merits of Aria's buffet are: a quick elevator ride from your room (rather than a 25 minute walk, ride, walk to Bellagio), shorter lines than Bellagio and quicker to fill your plate. So one strategy would be to do breakfast at Aria's buffet (a breakfast is a breakfast so no advantage to Bellagio buffet) then do dinner at one of Aria or Bellagio buffet.

Much like any other buffet, the options are endless, there were quite a few highlights and quite a few disappointments. That is the way of a buffet.

FATTY TIPS:
1. Save ~$7 by going in at 2:45 PM for a mid-day brunch\/dinner and continue eating into the afternoon as they bring out the crab and other dinner specific offerings
2. Wear leggings or vv loose pants

TRY THIS:
- Crawfish\/mussels\/clams from fisherman's stew
- Steamed snow crab 
- Salmon
- Blue cheese salad dressing
- California rolls
- Oatmeal raisin cookie (v crispy)
- Chocolate drizzled caramel corn 

DISGUSTING, do yourself a favor and skip this:
- guacamole
- ""paella"" (my friend says ""but put it in quotes, because THAT isn't paella"")
- lamb (my other friend says, ""if you enjoy eating your wildlife raw, get this"")
- white chocolate mousse ""cake pop""
- pistachio gelato (so artificial)
- butter pecan gelato

PS. Desserts are one of my favorite parts of Vegas buffers. Although the cakes were very pretty, they were all quite underwhelming (I tried 6). I wish the cake servings were even smaller, like bite size or something, so that I could try more. And also if you must indulge yourself at the gelato wheel, try the Cinnamon Toast Crunch gelato.",4,0,0

If you are looking to get a five-star meal at a casino buffet well then that's your fault for being disappointed. It is a buffet, and the food is mass produced. But of all the casinos on the strip, the aria buffet is by far the best quality of food. It is by far, the cleanest buffet on the strip.

For all those people who were not satisfied with the aria buffet,  stroll over to the buffet at the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino.....Awful. Now the buffet is a bit pricey.

* Ambiance = beautiful...new...very resort like...  The layout of the buffet is not customer friendly.  It's just a line of food from one end to another...if your favorite food is on the other side of the line, you gotta work for it.  

*  Food = VERY healthy....gluten free options available...  My main thing is crabs so I was happy to see the snow crabs.  The problem is...it is cold\/frozen, and they have such small portions displayed that people line up in line...it's kinda uncomfortable.  The dessert was pretty good.  Not as good as Paris buffet desserts but I liked them.

We decided to come back for dinner ($39.95) at the suggestion of the manager who said since it was their ""holiday dinner"" we would have options of expensive fish, lamb, and other delicacies. Our group was expecting a dinner on par with the Bellagio or at least Planet Hollywood or the Mirage. We returned later that night only to have been lied to and left disappointed. 

The only ""high end"" item other than crab legs were raw oysters, which smelled terrible. I would not have chanced eating them if you payed me. This buffet had no variety. For the price inflated ""holiday dinner"" instead of giving more food options it seems they may have taken roughly half away. So much space not used or filled. There were maybe two types of sushi rolls and two or three ""Italian"" dishes, one of which was noodles with red sauce which was probably from a can. There were about 10 options for sauce in the ""Indian"" section however there were no real dishes which would have needed them. 

Highlights: The king crab legs were decent,  the (overcooked) lobster bisque had decent flavor, and the overcooked prime-rib was tender. Their ""pork"" fried rice (labeled), which was actually shrimp fried rice, was actually pretty good. Creme brulee was great and some of the other desserts were not bad. The gelato was good however we ended up with options of vanilla, chocolate, mango, or lemon. Nice boring flavors to encourage you to pay $5 downstairs to get something interesting. 

Failures: The  sushi was inedible. The sushi rice they used was not fully cooked. The curry tri-tip was the texture of leather. Worst miso soup I have ever had. It tasted similar to the way gym socks smell and I seemed to have inconvenienced the guy who had to serve it, as he glared at me for making him work. The asian station in general was terrible. Some of the dessert combination were very strange, which is saying a lot because I love a good gourmet flavor combination or interesting parings. The chocolate covered strawberries were tiny, had no flavor, and the chocolate was the texture of wax. 

In addition to all of the food failures the actual buffet area reminded me of a cross between my junior high and a hospital cafeteria. Incorrect labels were written in black marker above the dishes and the only way to tell where certain types of food were located was is to walk around the unimpressive buffet area. 

Then we have the poor planning of the actual buffet's location. Our group was seated at a booth near the buffet line and ended up with a mild case motion sickness. We noticed that the ground and chairs were shaking constantly. The table next to us took out their iphone and used an ap which measures earthquakes. This shaking was enough to register on their phone. It turns out that the constantly running tram from the Aria to the Monte Carlo\/Bellagio is causing the shaking (according to our server), it did not stop for our entire meal. We ate less than normal due to the motion sickness. 

Maybe this, in addition to hiking up the price for a ""holiday dinner"", removing the majority of food items, and telling guests about all these non-existent gourmet food items, is the Aria's plan to make back the money spent on building the hotel? Who knows. 

Save your money and check out  Spice Market at Planet Hollywood or Cravings at the Mirage. Both are far superior for the same price. We will not be going back to the Buffet at Aria.",5,0,1

And by price, I mean the fact that our party of 4 paid $5 each, since we had two complimentary passes and my magic roulette fingers paid for a significant portion of the other two buffets (you do the math!).

I think if we had paid the full $38.95 for dinner, I would have been much pickier about this review.

That said, we had bottomless wine (of which I only drank a sip because of the heavy caloric intake*) and a 1 lb steamed lobster.

My cousins loaded up on all sorts of fancy meats (think, prime rib, steak, king crab, snow crab) and swore that the prime rib was the best they've had. I, however, had my life changed by one thing that night: the creme brulee. 

I devoured six of those suckers. Best creme brulee of my life! 

Anywho, if you have some sort of complimentary pass or discount, I'd go for it. If not, you might be disappointed just because of the competition from other buffets.

* ""this doesn't make sense"" , you're probably thinking. why are you complaining about calories at a buffet? Well, I tell you, the more you fill your belly with woozy wine the less space there is for the king crab. Duhhhh.",2,1,0

We came here specifically for the seafood, it's probably a hit or miss with it though. There are times when I found the crab meat to be super salty, not sure why but then the next day it was just fine so I don't know who it is that's adding the salt, but stop it! 

The rest of the food is alright, nothing too spectacular to note. They have a decent selection of dessert but I'll probably only stick to the gelato as the rest of it isn't THAT great at least to me. 

So really if you love seafood and don't want to venture down to the M for their weekend seafood buffet, then the one here is just as good! Might cost a bit more, but it's all the time so can't really complain and considering it's on the strip too? I think it came out to $27 per person with tax and maybe tip? I forgot if that was including tip or not but definitely tax. So really it's not a bad price at all. 

The service is pretty consistent, it's not bad but if they're slammed it's going to take a bit for you to get their attention. I, for one, drink a lot of water when I'm eating so I usually ask for two or three glasses so I know I'll have something before they get back to our table when it's busy.

The waiter  was attentive- dishes were cleared quickly;  and he checked on us frequently. 

Overall, the food was good based on buffet food standards.  
- The popular  snow crab legs were meaty and slightly salted.  As with most buffet items, once you taste more than five pieces of the same item, the taste gets progressively worse.  
- The best items were the fresh selection of sweet watermelon, cantaloupes, melons; and the delicious mini mint chocolate cupcakes- just perfect size and not too sweet
-As with most buffet meats, the meat items (ham, sausage) were dry; however,  the BBQ chicken was quite tasty and only a tad dry.
-The beef for the make-it-yourself tasty tacos was well seasoned.

I wasn't very impressed with the service or the food.  The place was very nice with some background music that wasn't too loud.  There was plenty of room to maneuver around. 

The presentation of the food in general didn't seem very appetizing.  We came at noon and I expected that the food would be ""fresh"".  Much of the food I got and tried was dried out, either sitting out for a while or over cooked.  For example, General Tsao's Chicken, chicken parmesan sliders, the Grilled Cobia, the country fried steak, the hash Browns,  sweet honey roasted chicken, pork at the taco bar, chicken & jalape√±o sausage, and even the meatballs.  I didn't try other stuff because it didn't look very appetizing, especially the food in the Asian section.  The stuff just seemed like it was just slopped there.

The best things I had were the spring mix salad with thousand island dressing and the clam chowder.  The cold snow crab legs were fine because they were cut in half;  why can't the cut the boiled snow crab legs.  Also, the cold peel and eat shrimp was also fine.  

The service was just so-so.  You have to pretty much ask for everything because when your drinks run down from tiny glasses, they do not automatically refill them, not once.  I saw quite a few of the workers gathered together just shooting the breeze.  The atmosphere was decent and I liked that there are bathrooms inside the buffet so you wash your hands after eating the shrimp and crab.  

I don't eat desserts too often and was told it was just okay.  Just average, nothing special and not much to chose from.  There were quite a few flavor sod ice cream to chose from from their rotating wheel.

I was very disappointed with my food and service experience.",1,0,0

We ended up eating at the Aria buffet for lunch the day we landed in Vegas, with anticipation to eat at the Bellagio buffet the following day. I was blow away by the selection at Aria. On any given day you can find, at least five types of dim-sum, fried rice, lo mein,  general tso chicken, assortment of sushi, piles of snow crab legs (already split for convenience), steamed crawfish, assortment of pizzas, Indian food, Israeli type mezze, a carving station, and finally a selection of comfort food. 

We were pleasantly overwhelmed with all the options, considering it was only lunch. Quite a few items are still a bit bland and will need salt, but that is typical with a buffet and hoping to satisfy many palettes. I think the lunch buffet was around $26 (plus tax\/tip), which I made up for with just the crab legs I ate. I kept flocking to the chicken shumai dim sum and shrimp dumplings. The curry chicken and tabouleh were also surprisingly good, but these items won't always be available. I completely over looked the soups, but I was informed there was also lobster bisque. 

My only complaint is that the cashier wanted 18% gratuity for our party of 8 to sit together, which perhaps we should have just paid. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at Aria buffet, which had a shorter line and was miles better than Bellagio's rendering. Eat here, especially if you're hungover.",3,0,1

We did the Friday lunch buffet - which was $25 per person. It was a good mix of sea food, BBQ, and throw in some decent selection for Asian dishes. There was a pizza station, Italian pastas, creo, plenty a salad stations, lots of baked breads etc. I am honestly not a buffet person but once in a while I can test my gluttonous tendencies. So I gave this a shot. 

I didn't go near BBQ because I was not ready for a meat fest at 12:30pm in the Vegas heat. But it looked good and I saw quite a decent sized peeps feasting on all the proteins. So it was mostly sea food for me. Mussels (including New Zealand), shrimp, crab legs, crawfish. I took a sampling of the 3 different kinds of Chinese dumplings they were serving. Not bad. Some sea food jambalaya, and as I approached the Mexican table - I could only manage to pick 2 tiny pieces of carnitas. 

3 pots of Indian dishes did not look worth trying at all. And sushi was absolutely run of the mill looking. Since we have been spellbound by ""Yama Sushi"" off the strip - I would have killed myself if I went near sushi of any kind. Yama sushi is the best sushi in Vegas. 

Coming back to aria. The desserts were super fabulous. And had it not been the decent sea food and the good selection of deserts - I would have given 2 stars. These 2 things are all worth the 25 bucks well spent and I didn't eat a single portion of food till the next day. 

Don't fill up yourself with alcohol. Instead have a good scoop of rum raisin ice cream and don't forget the raspberry chocolate moose pop on the stick. I had 3 and they were to die for!! This was my 1st buffet in Vegas and I am glad I tried. Somehow - I will pick all you can eat sushi at Yama over anything else.

aria buffet... it's just alright. nothing too special! you would think that in such a fancy hotel such as aria the food would be great. i came here for dinner with my boyfriend. there wasn't a line. we got seated right away.

they gave 1 complimentary lobster for the boyfriend & i. the lobster was not that great to be honest. but i guess since it's a buffet and its complimentary i can't exactly complain. don't be greedy with the crab legs like i did, because i didn't want to waste food and made myself stuff it down. it wasn't that great either. i squeezed so much lemon on those suckers but still the lemon just didn't want to be on those crab legs.

snickers cheesecake wasn't good. i liked that they had gelato however it was limited in flavors. the cranberry juice here is like one of the best i've had! so i would highly recommend that! 

gosh i grabbed a little of everything and i would have to say the chicken noodle soup and prime rib was the best. thank goodness the meal was free. i'm really glad we didn't have to pay for this meal because it so wasn't worth it.

i tried the sushi section. it was just okay. i can't complain because its a buffet. buffet sushi isn't ever truly that great. fish wasn't exactly fresh but wasn't exactly nasty. just tolerable.

I am a huge advocate for good customer service and I had read several reviews on here that rated this buffet poor in customer service.  I told the person I had the buffet with to keep in mind that this place is not known for their customer service so don't expect much.  I highly recommend giving this buffet a try. Our server was oustanding.. Her name is Catalina.  She greeted us with a smile, brought drinks and refills very quickly.  She cleared down our dirty plates in a timely fashion. She offered coffee at the end of the meal. She gave top notch service from beginning to end.
        Now for the food review,  we came specifically to eat breakfast since the place we regularly used to enjoy breakfast,  the M resort,  no longer serves breakfast as a buffet.
The food was great.  They offer bacon like all places, but also turkey bacon which you don't usually see.  What I had, I enjoyed.  I had an egg white omelet with mushrooms and cheese, bacon, hash browns and some French Toast sticks. By the time I finished my plate, the buffet turned over for lunch.  They had a lot of appetizing dishes. I look forward to my next visit.",3,1,2

Then I moved onto the seafood items.  The king crab legs obviously frozen, boiled shrimp, and even crawfish.  They did have a nice selection of mussels, seafood stew, and chowders.
Lots of hot items, pizzas, carving meats, some ok pasta dishes including butternut ravioli and veggie lasagna.  Fair meatballs and broccoli Rabe.
They had a middle Eastern bar, including hummus and baba gannoush.
The Chinese food was worse than Chinese takeout at home.  Dumplings looked mushy.
Desserts were the best items.  Bananas foster, gourmet cupcakes, pecan pie, flan.....all high quality. Cookies, muffins, pastries as well

He made our experience there that much more enjoyable and wonderful. The food was Amazing. Hot crab legs on the dinner buffet and already cracked for you so all you had to do was scoop out the meat. A variety of shrimp and so much more to choose from. Their labeling system was a little different for foods. Instead of being on the glass over the food it was on chalkboards on that strip of the bar above all the foods. Very inventive and cute. Dessert bar was amazing.

Although the place is very clean and there are a lot of stations, it just did not impress me.  Things are not really labeled well (off the actual spot or not labeled at all) and some of the offerings are less than spectacular (dry white rice with crappy soy - not Kikkoman, lackluster breakfast pastries).  Our server was super nice and entertained my need for many beverages, but I just didn't feel like this lived-up to the $19 price tag for me.  There were some Mexican and Mediterranean offerings that also seemed really odd for 7 in the morning (curried cauliflower? full chips and salsa bar?)  I ended up just eating a bunch of the Asian stuff (shrimp dumplings, potstickrets, fried rice, noodles, rice)  and calling it a day.  I really had hoped they would have had miso soup on that table or more than like 3 dry cereals .  Where is the shrimp and grits or biscuits and gravy??

We rolled the dice and decided to take a short walk from our New York New York hotel room and make an attempt to eat our monies worth at the Aria hotel buffet. The total came to over $50 for two people and we crapped out. 

Aria won as we did not find a buffet fit for a king or my queen. There was a variety of global flavors: Mexican, Mediterranean, Italian, Chinese and a pitiful spread labeled American. I have to admit, I'm a bit of a picky eater and typically stick with the simple things--pizza, burgers, chicken--you know, steak and potatoes kinda guy. The pizza was dry and there was only two slices left as I approached the Italian section. There were no burgers or burger making station, that would've been neat but maybe too big an ask. The fried chicken was the highlight as it was crunchy and had a nice flavor. As good as the chicken were the mashed potatoes, problem is--I had to hold up the line scraping the last bits of potatoes from the bottom of the pot. O well, at least I should be able to find a nicely charred stake to go with my tea spoon of potatoes. NOPE. There was no steak on the buffet. No steak, that's right folks, no steak on a $20 plus\/per person buffet. I had to settle for honey glazed ham--another positive element--and under cooked roast beef. 

Hey, there was a great salad bar...O, no French dressing. Yes I know, I'm picky...why would I expect some odd request like French dressing. 

The dessert station was quite an impressive presentation. Too bad the taste didn't quite match the looks.

Also it's only 16$ to add bottomless mimosas or beer to your buffet experience and this is the cheapest compared to all the other buffets in Las Vegas, well according to my research anyway...lol

After finishing my first plate, I got up and asked one of the hostesses if she could send a waiter\/waitress over to get our drinks, as ourselves and the other three tables around us were still waiting on that. 

She could have been polite. Instead, she literally told me that I was being impatient (no water or any other drinks after 20-25 minutes), and basically told me to sit down and be quiet, and that they'd get me drinks when they were ready to. 

We should have left then, and asked for a refund. The manager did very little to help, though she did say she would have a talk with her staff and see what happened. We got our drinks more than a half hour after being seated at our table, and the food was mediocre at best.

The seafood that they do have is delicious and the bean salads that they have are nice, but after serving two small plates of cold seafood, I felt bored and unsatisfied.

That means that my friend and I had a $68 credit for the Buffet for 4 days. This is FAT BOY status...::grinch smile =). Aria also has a $12.99 Bottomless Wine, Mimosa, Beer, Heineken, Peach Bellini, Sangria, Mimosa, list is endless, drinky drink thing you can add on to any buffet. That itself is worth it's weight in gold!The flippin desserts!! They are world class! I'm pretty sure the people that make the dessert at Jean Phillipe downstairs make the desserts for the buffet. Just when you thought it couldn't get any better they add the new gelato ""wheel of fortune"" machine. I loved the Mandarin Yuzu flavor, it was a citrus explosion! Not too sour, not too sweet, and Yuzu has such a unique flavor. I destroyed the Vanilla Dulche Brownie flavor as well. Ahhh...so many flavors, so little time. Red Velvet Cupcakes, Strawberry Cheesecake with the little Aria chocolate square stuck in the middle like a ninja star, the Blood Orange Panna Cotta, The Carrot Cake, The Flan with the Raspberry on top...Raspberry plus Flan = Fireworks! My absolute favorite is the Pecan Pie. My friend's mom makes it every new year and I tell her that I will pay her for racks of this stuff, but she never believes me! Aria does not play they add a dollop of espresso, then they stack a little chocolate surfboard on top that with some gold specks. On the side of the plate is a streaky blob of caramel sauce. Heaven on earth! My slogan was Pecan Pie? Das Eriday! The Espresso takes it from great to amazazing! That is just some of desserts!

Remember there's still food! I always hit up the carving station. I just get the juicy wings off the roasted chicken and a couple pieces of brisket with some bbq sauce. Hits the spot everytime. Then I hit up the crab legs, not just crab legs. Aria knows better than that! They are pre-split in half!  So you just grab your mountain of crab and just pick out the meat. Everytime I eat crablegs, I get mad because they are not split this way. I liked the little fish and chips that came in a little fryer basket too. 

I kept it simple and rotated everything that I mentioned for 3 days, the 4th day we ate at Sage. Lunch is only $23 with the bottomless drink $13. You seriously cannot beat that! Having it included with your stay is just stupid good.

We also came a little bit before dinner, so we could pay the brunch price and get both brunch AND dinner foods. Gotta love beating the system :)

Immediately, the buffet pleased me. Why, you ask? There was no line! I'm so used to waiting in huge lines whenever I eat at the buffets in Vegas (especially Paris&Bellagio, those buffets ALWAYS have at least a 45 minute wait). We were seated pretty quickly, even though we were a large group, and we were immediately chowing down. For the weekend brunch, they had a good amount of food items. Snow crab legs, sushi, eggs benedict, caprese salad, sliced bacon, pancakes, breakfast burritos... I could go on forever. Most of the food was decent, but nothing really blew me out of the water. Once the menu changed to dinner, there were king crab legs, lobster ravioli, freshly baked naan, prime rib, refried beans, etc etc. Some of the food was delicious and some was just meh. The refried beans were INCREDIBLY salty to the point where I couldn't eat anymore after the first bite. I was also pretty disappointed with the king crab legs. I LOVE crab and I've had king crab legs at a buffet before (the wynn) but these didn't taste as good; they tasted exactly the same as the snow crab legs, which was really disappointing.

This buffet really shined in the dessert area. All of the desserts looked beautiful and I was really happy with their spread; plenty of cakes, cookies, and even a serving station for gelato. I tried the nutella cake (DELICIOUS), pot de creme (freaking amazing!!!), and of course, the creme brulee. Everything I tried from the dessert bar was orgasmic-tasting. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

As for the service, ours was pretty decent. There were portions of time where they wouldn't come and plates would be stacking, but we always had liquid to drink and I was pretty content.

Overall, it's a decent buffet. Food is average & the desserts are GREAT. The price is definitely better than some of the other buffets in Vegas, but I think if you want some quality food, I'd go for the Wynn or Bellagio buffets.

I had brunch at The Buffet twice during my stay.  The space is clean and well-kept and the layout is much more straightforward than many other buffets on The Strip.  The selection, though, is relatively underwhelming compared to almost all other buffets I have been to (the lone exception being the smaller scale Cafe Lago in Caesar's Palace).  The taste of the food is about average--definitely a step above Wynn (the worst of the buffets I have visited) but not quite as good as Bellagio and Paris.  I would note, however, that the Eggs Benedict were a major disappointment, and I can't figure out how their ""only Tandoor Oven in a Las Vegas buffet"" comes into play.

Service was about par for the course--meaning too few servers trying to staff too many tables.",1,2,1

During my trip to vegas I went to the buffets at M, Aria, and Planet Hollywood and surprisingly this was my favorite. While it isn't perfect, as long as you are selective with what you eat I believe this makes for a pleasant dining experience. I came here for lunch and while $20 isn't cheap, I easily got my money's worth stuffing myself with crab legs, jumbo shrimp, and raw shellfish. The prime rib was the best I had among the 3 buffets, although that wasn't saying much as none were as good as the prime rib at even an average sit down restaurant.  Pizza, which in most buffets doesn't even look like food, actually looked edible here, though I didn't try it. The asian food was entirely forgettable, but again, I don't go to buffets to eat those kinds of things.They also had an excellent selection of desserts which were nicely presented. Most of the desserts were good but avoid the fruity sauce thats on the side of the cakes because they're way too sweet.

Perhaps the thing that stood out the most at this place is the service. I was very thirsty that day and was downing my coke every 5-10 mintues, but I never had to go more than a couple minutes without a drink before our waiter came by and refilled my drinks. He also cleared our plates with great efficiency, as every time I got up to get more food the dirty plates were all gone by the time I got back. I also loved that there was no wait as well. Some people would interpret that to mean the buffet is no good, but cmon is any buffet really worth standing an hour in line for? 

Probably the weakest aspect of this buffet would be the design and decor of the place. The buffet is a bit on the small side, so it was occasionally difficult to navigate past people at different stations. They had a custom salad station where they make your salad to order, and put it and the seafood section at the front, which caused an unnecessary bottleneck. The overall design of the buffet was fairly plain as well, although they do have some window seats.

I can understand why people who came here for dinner would be underwhelmed, assuming the food is mostly the same. I too probably would be hesitant to come for dinner, but for lunch this place is worth it.",1,1,1

I never find any buffet food up to standard as it's just a place to gorge yourself. This was pretty much the same. We wanted to try it because everyone says the buffets in Vegas are the best. The hot foods were mediocre-good, but the desserts were really tasty. Whomever is making those desserts can do with a raise because I went back for seconds.

The tandoori chicken at the Indian station sat too long and was dry. The curry was good. Everyone goes mental for pre-cracked crab legs, I never really understood that. They feel as if they are getting one-up on the man if they shove 40 crab legs down their throat. The cioppino was being stored at a very dangerous temperature. I had one sip and realized it wouldn't be wise to continue eating it. The asian station was a step-up mainly because it was busy so the food was being made fresh. The carvery was good as well, the roast chicken was juicy and tasty. The sushi wasn't bad although it wasn't freshly rolled and the choices were limited.

Generally, food is Super salty.  Prime rib was Salty, Oyster was not so fresh, over all food quality is somewhat equal to Hometown Buffet quality.  I think, they should charge around $15 for it.

Well, the tomato bisque and the BBQ brisket were standout items for me, and I don't think I could have gotten much better at an a la carte restaurant. Most of the food was in general very good, and felt fresh and the right temperature by the time it reached my table.

The buffet is easy to get to from the strip; just follow the signs through the hotel and go up the escalator. We came right at 5pm and there was only one group ahead of us in line. This past weekend I liked that they had lots of decorations for Easter and a whole table of kid friendly foods. The buffet is nicely laid out with lots of signage. 

Aria's buffet has one of the best salad bars that I've ever seen for a buffet. All of the ingredients are very fresh and they have a wide assortment of vegetables and salad toppings. If your goal was to ""eat the rainbow"", you can definitely achieve that here. In addition to make your own salad they had pre-made petite wedge salads, quinoa salad, warm spinach salad, lots of fresh fruits, and guacamole. In addition to the salad bar they had a wide arrangement of seafood including baked oysters, paella, Thai curry mussels, crawfish boil, cajun crab legs, salmon, ahi tuna, warm steamed crab legs and also cold king and snow crab legs, cocktail shrimp, and more! They also had a wide assortment of dishes from around the world including lamb osso buco, aloo chat, menudo, sushi, dim sum, and pizza to name a few. Other highlights included a made to order pasta station, carved meats, and a rotating wheel of ice cream at the dessert station. I was incredibly surprised to see mochi ice cream and got one of every flavor to try. My favorites were definitely the red bean\/chocolate and mango. The green tea was a little too strong for my taste, and the coconut and vanilla were pretty basic. According to our server they only have mochi ice cream on holidays. 

During our time at the buffet we had two servers. The first one was very attentive and had our drinks refilled before we even had the chance to notice they were low. Unfortunately the second server wasn't that great and we ended up waiting for refills that never came. I'm giving this buffet 3 stars because I think that taste wise other buffets are better and the food is more fresh. Several of the dishes that I saw at Aria looked like they had been sitting under the heat lamp for a long time.

He moved it all the way down to 1 star because of badly made sushi rice?  Out of the 30 or whatever courses they served, 1 hard rice ball and he freaks out...  I'd have to say that's a bit harsh.  

Anyway, I was quite happy about the food here, having eaten buffets the day before too (seems like a vegas ritual for me).  I had the Wynn buffet before, and it was almost 10 bucks more and didn't have the king crab legs with less selection (slightly, and lunch).  

My visit was for lunch on the weekend, and it wasn't too crowded, but it was full.  The wait wasn't too bad though.  They have it all, or most of what I would want in a buffet.  King crab legs (no snow crab!), coctail shrimp (I think it's only half cooked for max crispness, and when I told my coworker he said it's ceviche style but it was still coctail shrimp), prime rib was very tender and you can choose between well done or med rare.  I tried the lamb too but the guy sliced a end cut for me and I hate well done meats (except for pork of course).  The tomato bisque was good, the chinese congee was very tasty, even the apple crepe was good.  The dessert is awesome because they are all served on individual plates, and taste pretty decent.  The icecream was great though.  It was very creamy and tasty.  

It was I think 24 a person on a weekend, so the price was excellent for what you get, and the server was very friendly.  I think the decor is ok, as the bankers really started to save money on the decorations, but it wasn't terrible.  But you can see cheap touches if you look closely.  

My only complaint was it was missing lobster, but I guess you get that for dinner, and you pay more too.  But that's nitpicking.  It's pretty good for what you pay for in a buffet.  After this it feels like the 40 dollar (or 30 dollar for lunch) ones are really overcharging people.",1,1,1

The Aria buffet isn't bad. It's definitely good in some spots but not good in others. I don't go out of my way for buffets but Cosmo, Aria, and Wynn get a pass in my book. 

I had a myvegas reward and ended up getting two lunches for 29$. They have a lot of other drinks besides soda so I ordered pineapple juice. They have an all you can drink menu to add for 16$ but who can really drink all of that? Especially when copious amounts of food are involved. 

The steamed crab, mussel bake, and Asian food are some of the best. In my opinion the dessert fall flat except the gelato and some sugar free items. The elote needed more seasoning but the pork and leek cake had amazing flavor. They also have congee\/ porridge and a variety of soups. They have mini pho and ramen in addition to a carving station. The beef Colorado has good flavor  and was tender. Pizza was just okay and the charcuterie was not quite as good as last time. I would maybe try dinner to see if it's any better but I'd stick to Asian dishes and seafood. The split crab is good but the steamed is even better and more flavorful. Interestingly enough this has become a stop, but I'd definitely try wicked spoon first. 

No service complaints and plates didn't pile up.  A diverse selection of food including Mediterranean and Indian.",7,2,2

They never have fresh mimosas. I never know where they come from, but no bottles of champagne in sight.

Tips:
-Go for the warm\/hot snow crab legs (much better than the cold ones)
-Clam chowder was great and you can put in some freshly cooked clams from another section of the buffet too.  They're in a big pot.

The night we visited  the soups were lukewarm and not kept hot. The noodle station was left unmanned. We had to get someone's attention to serve us.

We were pleasantly surprised that it lived up to what the sites were saying with some caveats. Everything was well prepared and there were a lot of items that were good, unlike most of the other places around where there is a large variety of items but each is mediocre. On the other hand, if you want variety, there are limited options, compared to places like Bacchanal at Caesar's Palace.

The buffet here is more seafood focused and the warm snow crab legs here were very good, better than the other places we've been to including Bacchanal, Wynn and Bellagio. The cold crab legs were less flavorful, so we ended up sticking with the warm snow crab legs. The prime rib was also very good, again on par or better than the other places we've tried. Other good items included the sliders, and all the desserts we tried were very good. The desserts are larger than the typical offerings elsewhere. They also had a gelato section, which was also very good. 

While the spicy tuna hand roll was good, the sushi section was limited compared to other places. There was a small Chinese section with several steamed bun\/dim sum options, but we didn't sample these. In addition, they also had a pho section, which we also skipped since we've had disappointing results elsewhere. There was a section on Indian food, including a tandoori oven which made tandoori chicken for dinner. We tried a piece of this, as it was interesting to have this option. Alas, while it looked like tandoori chicken, it was missing much of the flavor in authentic tandoori chicken.

As an interesting aside, they score the warm snow crab legs in the middle which makes it very easy to crack in half without any crab eating tools, then you can pull the crab meat out very easily.

All in all, if you go in knowing that the options will be a bit more limited than some place like Bacchanal, then you will be pleasantly surprised at how many items are actually very delicious, with the seafood, prime rib and desserts all being very strong. This has become my wife's favorite buffet in Las Vegas, with Wynn and Bacchanal to follow in that order, though we understand that things may change in the future.",0,0,0

The Buffet at ARIA was very good for a buffet. After seeing Zarkana and having been starving all day, I was feeling a bit nauseous and felt as though I was going to throw up all over (though I'm not sure how, having not eaten much at all). I wound up getting two full plates of food and dessert at ARIA and felt A-OK. So hey, at least I didn't get food poisoning! Always a plus after having food from a buffet.

This buffet is the biggest I've ever eaten at... there's an insane amount of options from a bunch of different cuisines. Chinese, Mexican, Japanese, American, and Indian that I can think of off the bat. I didn't have any of the Chines food, but the Mexican was good, the sushi was decent, the American food above average, and the Indian food also really tasty.

The best part about my visit? Probably when my girlfriend's dad asked for peanut butter gelato with chocolate and nuts on top, but was given mango gelato with chocolate and nuts on top. That just about made my night.

Sure, the service is a bit slow (as seems to be a theme at Vegas buffets), but it's adequate enough. I appreciated that our foreign waitress was late to our table because she said she had to pee. Most people would probably be grossed out by that, but I appreciated the honesty!",2,2,2

While you can start with Korean hot buns, you could also choose to go for the tamales, Indian curries, or even try out their large seafood section. Myself, well I chose a bit of everything.

Pros: The dining area was simply but tastefully designed. Access to food choices was ample. There were a number of food choices. The wait staff was friendly.

Cons: The attempt at ethnic foods fell flat, as the food choices per ethnic station were extremely limited (want Mediterranean? Hummus or tabouhlea (so)). The focus seemed to be on providing large amounts of seafood over any other line of food, and the sushi which I chose wasn't very good. Much of the food wasn't hot or even barely warm. Quite frankly, the salad was about the tastiest item I chose. I could get a larger food selection at Ryan's or other buffet food location.

We got there 10 mins before dinner time so we paid the lunch price...we also had no wait in line and the amount of people in the buffet was comfortable.  No running into people with ur plate or waiting to serve yourself!

I'm a BIG buffet person and normally I only like 30-50% of foods at a buffet, but this buffet was just delicious to me!  There's just something about having different types of edibles all around you as far as eyes can see that puts a smile on a face.  Its a very clean restaurant.  Decor was really modern and light colored which made for a better appetite in my opinion.  Their food presentation was on point, made it real inviting and appetizing, there was no mess anywhere.  Items were constantly being refilled with fresh replacements.  

Prime Rib - the piece i got was very rare and fatty.  A+  however it wasn't as juicy 
                      as i was hoping, easily fixed with some au jus and salt\/pepper.
Crab Legs - legs\/claws were served cold and sliced open for convenience..they
                      gladly steamed mine and it was delicious, moist and sweet + some
                      drawn butter, i was 100% satisfied!
Beef Stroganoff - Kind of a rare dish for me to see at a Vegas buffet but i was        
                               happy nonetheless.  It had great flavor and was loaded with 
                               mushrooms. 
Parmesan Asparagus - served cold and was cooked perfectly, had a slight 
                                           crunch and was delightful.  I also really don't see too
                                           much asparagus at buffets so it was a very nice surprise.
Creamed spinach - was AWESOME!  
Loaded MashedTatos - AWESOME as well.  It had lots of green onions and 
                                           cheese.

There were a bunch of other little items that were really great.

The only items i felt needed a little work on was getting more of an asian selection.  I mean it wasn't the best, but was better than other chinese food at other hotel buffets.  They're mussels pasta could've been really good, but was just WAY too salty i had to take a swig after each bite, i gave up after the 3rd.  Wasn't impressed with their sushi just cuz it looked like there was more rice ratio than anything.  And lastly their salads looked real appetizing but lacked good flavor on the 2 that i tried, the Caesar and Chinese Chicken salad.  

The one thing i was very disappointed in was me and the hubby not receiving any complimentary champagne\/wine\/lobster as other reviewers were saying they received...  Maybe because we got there right before dinner time but still disappointing..

Lastly, their desserts.  Im not a dessert person but i tried some bread pudding and my eyes rolled back!  Had 2 plates of that.  Also had Tiramisu and their Snickers cake which was awesome!

Get some crab meat and put in your chowdah. Eat with a side of fresh naan bread. It's good. Or do what gf does and get a half and half bowl. Half clam chowder and half lemongrass soup.

I am comparing this to other buffets I have had. We used to come to Vegas for the fabulous buffets , 99 cent shrimp cocktails, and the free drinks on the tables. Well at least the drinks are still ""theoretically free""   haha. Now no one comes just for the buffets ,but rather the 5 star chefs restaurants located in the many ritzy hotels!
  Ok every hotel has a buffet, some are really really big and others specialize in a few things like ""seafood"" or lobster .This buffet is not too big and offers a good selection of quality items. I don't need food from all over the world and a sample of every dish, however what i do want is quality dishes for what is put out. I found that the beef , prime rib, and the seafood (crab legs) were very good.  Aria even had an omelet bar for breakfast... a real plus!  I did try a little spanish rice and some pasta.... just for a taste and they were good too. I always have a little vegetables, salads, and various greens, and those were all quite exceptional. Now don't expect to get some fantastic service besides a few big  drinks, it is well worth the brunch price......champagne doesn't hurt either",0,0,0

The staff is very friendly but when it gets busy they ignore you a bit.

Unlike what a previous review said you start off with king crab legs\/shrimp now (I went a day before and the crab\/shrimp were at the end)... the shrimp is what I expect it to be for paying $30 and the crab is just alright.  Ask them to steam the crab!!! Important! It tastes much better + the butter.

There's sushi... avoid the nigiri (or rice + very little sashimi).  The fish isnt really what I expected.  Some of the sushi is alright.  I really liked the spider rolls.

There is a carvery station with turkey, flank steak, and prime rib (depending on the hour\/day) they mix it up.  An Indian section with goat\/curry\/hummus\/etc.  Then there is an Asian section where you can get won-ton noodles upon request (not too bad but I could get one near my house for 5 bucks).  They have a good asian carvery (One night was good peking duck and the next day was cantonese BBQ Pork).  

There isnt really much of a fruit selection.

Then there's the dessert section.  The best part, honestly.  TRY THE CARROT CAKE! It's pretty good, not too sweet and well presented.  The Gelato and Macaroons are pretty good too!

Definitely an above average buffet but nothing about it jumps out and says I AM THE END OF HUNGER FOR YOU'RE ENTIRE STAY IN VEGAS! ALL OTHER BUFFETS KNEEL BEFORE ME! PREPARE YOUR PIE-HOLE FOR PIE!

The glasses for drinks are laughably small, i think the coffee mugs hold more liquid. Drink service was a bit on the sorry side as well. Here's an idea maybe if we increase the capacity of the glasses our guests would shut up less about refills! Yeah how bout that! Also heard something about the 'bottomless drinks' being limited to three, didnt cash in on that offer so i cant really verify.

So everything was your average buffet experience. You got Europeans who just love to cut in line or stand in the middle of the damn place or walk and suddenly stop causing you to dodge them or risk bumping them with loaded plates. You got chinese tourists with every square inch of their plate filled with snow crab legs. You got staff looking miserable as they refresh the station that's been refreshed a mere 15 min ago. And the busers who some way some how mange to balance a tray full of your BS while putting up with your BS. Tip these people well...

Meal highlighs include anything cooked in the tandoor. The tandoori chicken was a bit under-seasoned but the tandoor gave it much more flavor. The nan is semi made to order, if you'd like a fresh one someone at hte station would be able to reheat a premade one and even garlic that SOB up for you. 

The garlic asparagus in the Italian section as well as the garlic green beans by the dinner section were quite enjoyable and cooked perfectly. Lots of freshness and garlic. Side note, i spent a few years eating in military messing facilities which are set up like buffets but considerably crappier and loads more depressing, unless it's an Air Force chow hall. Due to this, when ever is see fresh veggies that arent part of the salad bar i get all giddy and usually grab a hefty portion. 

The dessert section was a bit of a hit or miss for me. The Panna cotta was quite enjoyable where as the red velvet whoopie pies were just bombed out and depleted. The gelato wasnt too bad but there were way too many chunks of ice that added to the texture. 

I would go back if they had some kind of special promotion going on but wouldn't go out of my way to get some.

Pros:
-Very clean, ample light, new 
-Unlimited crab legs and smoked salmon (I think I could have just eaten an entire lunch of these). Although the crab legs were a tad salty in my opinion
-DESERTS, where do I start? Every desert, aside from the Creme Brule was spectacular. I especially enjoyed the extra strong mocha icecream and the strawberry cheese cake. My sister had the German chocolate cake which she said was equally as good. 
-The tofu spinach soup was really good, too bad I added too much Sriracha for my tastebuds to handle
-Make your own pasta bar: say your combination of sauce and toppings and they whip you up a fresh bowl of hot pasta
-The lines inside were nonexistent even though we came it at 12:30
-Waitress bussing the drinks was very polite and quick at clearing out unwanted dishes

Cons:
-Drink selection is sort of limited or not properly advertised

The prime rib and salmon weren't so good. And actually the one who served the prime rib was not courteous and I ended up complaining to the manager for that. I saw the chef cooking up a piece of prime rib for another customer but was reluctant to do so for me and my husband. I felt that his service wasn't consistent and impolite to us (while we were requesting nicely) so I had to complain to the manager. I understand it's a buffet, not a steak house, but service is still a matter regardless what kind of cuisine a restaurant is serving. So that's a big minus for us. The manager was very nice to help us out to get our prime rib grilled. We had to have the prime rib grilled because we don't eat rare or medium rare meat, and the prime rib was at most medium rare at the time we were eating there. And I think we got compensated by being charged for 1 person instead of 2 due to the unpleasant experience. So it's well resolved that way.

The desserts are great though regardless the unpleasant experience with the prime rib chef. The desserts are great and I had a lot of them. The buffet description said they have the desserts from Jean Philippe Patisserie. So I ate alot of the desserts that seemed to be from Jean Philippe Patisserie (but I really couldn't tell which one was and which one wasn't).

Anyway, it's good to at least try it once and see if we wanna go again. And we probably might not go there again for full price. I do like the dessert but I think I would rather just get them from Jean Philippe Patisserie downstairs, probably cost less that way and still satisfy my craving for Jean Philippe Patisserie desserts.",0,0,0

They've added two new stations: Fish Market and Latin to bring a total of 11 stations. Of course, it's always a wiser choice to eat buffets during lunch on a weekday, and it's even better when your mom has free passes because she likes to gamble. But if I had to pay that day, it would have been $22.99 for a Friday lunch buffet. I really didn't think this buffet was that far off from Bacchanal at Caesar's Palace. I paid over $50, albeit dinner, for Bacchanal a few months ago, and I left just as satisfied.

Their Asian section is not as good as Bacchanal's, but they do have a few dim sum goodies. I was surprised that their chicken & waffles were really good. Waffles were moist and the chicken was tender and juicy. Another surprise I found were dried mangoes in their cheese section. I've never seen dried mango at a buffet before, and you can bet I snagged a few in my purse for the road. Dried mangoes - my weakness. They also had really fresh smoked salmon, which I made a lox bagel with their assortment of cream cheese. 

Dessert was amazing, although I am biased because I have a sweet tooth. I pretty much love all pastries. On average, I spend close to half my time at the dessert bar, unless it's just terrible. The dessert bar here is comparable to Bacchanal's. They had a large assortment of pastries from chocolate and almond croissants, to blueberry crumble muffins. Their coconut macaroons were so moist and decadent. The only disappointing thing would be their ice cream. They have a good variety, but it just didn't taste very creamy. It was a bit puffy, like a little too airy or something. Overall, I really liked this buffet and would recommend this over Bacchanal; it's just a better deal.",6,3,4

Some of our favorites included the red velvet stuffed pancakes, the steamed crab legs with hot butter, the eggs Benedict station, the chocolate chip with walnut cookies (kind of tastes like the Double Tree cookies..

They do not have an overwhelming amount of options, and the presentation is okay. Personally I think other buffets like the Wicked Spoon at Cosmo has cuter presentation for some of their dishes, and they might have a few more options. However, still not a bad deal. Prices are average for a ""nice"" vegas buffet. $24.95 for breakfast Monday-Friday. No breakfast buffet options on the weekends, just brunch for $29.95. Not sure how much lunch or dinner runs; I've been here twice and both times were weekend brunches.

Secondly: quality. Best quality crab around at buffets, period. Easily better than Bellagio, with warm clarified butter along side, a glaring absence in the Bellagio crab presentation  easy. Plus (this is a secret!) they'll steam your crab legs if you ask!  The shrimp for shrimp cocktails are huge! Way plumper than I have seen at any other buffet  The prime rib was was perfect, braised short rib ragu was for tender, mashed potatos tasted real, rotisserie chicken was juicy, pizza was edible, even their attempt at indian food was pretty good.  
Not to mention the dessert was much better than Bellagio.  They have REAL cheesecake and great carrot cake, plus some flambe banana thing that was amazing.
1 thing Bellagio has is rack of lamb (at least on fridays saturdays), but considering all this quality stuff and the price difference, The Buffet is definitely a better choice.  Oh and my waiter was great; fast and polite!

They have a special oven that cooks Indian Naan bread which was very good and the tandoori chicken was very moist. I've been to many Las Vegas buffets n Aria does not make my top 5 list.

Even when the crowds have 'creased.  
Each day when the lights go on it can be found by the pound all around
Oh what a lovely feast.

This appetizing yarn of mine is true.  But, it's probably more of a qualified truth since the food you'll find at The Buffet at ARIA is decent but will become increasingly unappetizing as you consume more.  Nonetheless, this is a place where you can glut glut glut glut!

It's been several years since I've been to a buffet of this caliber, so needless to say, I was starved for the variety of options available at a smorgasbord like the one at ARIA.  My initial plan was to stay at the buffet from lunch to dinner so that I wouldn't have to worry about eating multiple meals.  After all, buffets aren't cheap!  (Weekend brunch is $29.99 \/ Weekend dinner $39.99.)  But, as I sat with a dystopian novel in hand, I found that my eyes wandered from the text to the serving area, which was in my direct line of sight - a foolish maneuver.  The more my eyes wandered, the more I wanted to eat.  And, eat I did!  Thus, my glorious plan to stay at the buffet from 2:30PM to 6:30PM was foiled, and I left after only two hours.

Like most buffets, you pay when you enter the buffet.  You're given the option to tip, and I would recommend doing so since there are friendly and helpful waiters\/waitresses who will bring you drinks and clear your plates.  Once you've paid, you will be ushered to a table, asked for your drink order, and then are free to roam around the buffet.  The buffet itself has various stations that serve a range of cuisines (Asian, Indian, Italian, Latin, and Mediterranean) as well as various types of meat (fish, seafood, beef, ham, turkey), salad, and dessert.  Sorry vegans; there didn't appear to be any dessert that was free of animal products (or at the very least dairy-free)!

Part of the reason why I chose to dine at The Buffet at ARIA was because my friend had recommended their buffet as a decent, cheap-ish alternative to some of the fancier (read: more expensive) buffets like Bacchanal. In general, I found that assessment to be accurate, but your dining experience will probably be dictated by how much you eat \/ how terrible you feel after X number of servings.  Most of my pieces of prime rib were perfectly cooked (medium), but my last piece was tough, dry, and unappetizing (well).  Definitely specify what slice you want; otherwise, the carver will just give you something undesirable.  The ham was good, but not comparable to what you could get at Honeybaked Ham.  I would definitely not recommend eating any of the dim sum if you are at all accustomed to good Chinese food, as I found the charsiu bao and har gow both mushy and strange.  Some of the vegetable options in the Asian station were all right, but were drenched in sauce.  The seafood station had various types of crab legs, shrimp, oysters, smoked salmon, and the like.  Most of these items were tasty, though you could tell they had been previously frozen.  The salad station had ample fruit and vegetables that I would have happily eaten all day.  But, if you're a vegetarian, it's probably not worth coming to this buffet.  

Although I generally enjoyed dining at this buffet, I probably should have stopped after my third plate of food, as my final serving made me hate myself and the food I had just eaten. Moral of the story: if you want to enjoy your dining experience, it might not be the best idea to try to get your money's worth.",5,3,4

Food: The crab legs were good and the prime rib decent but there was a real lack of selection! The entire Mediterranean section was basically hummus. And there were a lot of things that repeated. The desserts LOOKED good but were for the most part uninspiring. The gelato was delicious (and fun to look at as its display case rotated) but was too soft probably due to the case opening and closing too many times.

Service: Service was excellent and we had the friendliest waitress ever. Kudos to her!

So all in all, I can't recommend the Aria buffet. It's a shame as the hotel is great and one of our favorites. Is it that hard to make a better buffet to match the rest of the hotel, especially when they're charging more than Bellagio? Skip this and take the monorail to Bellagio for a more satisfying experience.

Tip: If you MUST eat here, lunch\/dinner swaps out around 3:30pm so come a little before that and pay the lunch price ($22.99 on M-F) but get the dinner selections saving you about $11 per person ($17 on Friday!). Just make sure you don't cut it too close on time as the line can get pretty long, especially on weekends. (If you have a pearl or higher Mlife card, you can go to the VIP line.)",1,0,0

My last Vegas buffet was at the Wynn and I was blown away. Their selection was good but everything tasted amazing. They had a wide variety of items. 

Here at Aria, I didn't see that. Their selection seemed limited and whatever was there, was rather basic and lacked in flavor. They literally had like two to three kinds of sushi, how disappointing. A lot of their food didn't have the flavor that hooked me.

The service was also not up to par. Our waitress\/server lagged in cleaning up our used plates, etc. It was a really busy night so I understood how she must've had many tables, but I took note that she kept going to two specific tables more often than ours.

The only thing that redeems Aria's buffet is the fact that they sliced the crab legs for you. Other than that.. nothing. Maybe the creme brulee, but their dessert selection was horrible. No macarons.. For $35, no macarons? Really? Bread pudding looked dry, I heard the gelato was no good. 

Initially they had nigiri in their sushi section, but when I went for seconds, they only had California rolls and other cheap rolls. Their prime rib was good. They had naan and vegetable masala; both were good, but I can eat that stuff at an Indian buffet for like 8 bucks. Didn't have much variety at the Mexican, Italian, or Asian stations. 

I was really excited to try this buffet since it's at one of the top hotels\/casino in Vegas, but I was very let down. Also, their service is horrible. I never once got a refill on my ice tea, couldn't even find the waitress to ask.

Oh, we also had a huge party like at least 40 people or so. So the person organizing it had spoken to them previously and we had a reservation for 6pm and they would only give us 2 hours to eat and charged us 20% gratuity. Then they totally forgot about the reservation, so the whole crowd of us just stood outside for a good 30 minutes for them to clear up tables for us. Um, thanks. And 20% gratuity? It's a buffet!  15% or 18%, I can understand. And as I've mentioned before, their service sucked.

Should have been a first sign that maybe we should have gone somewhere else. However, for $42.99\/person on a weeknight and $37.99 on a weekday, this is one of the more reasonably priced buffets in Vegas. 

Before I get anything, I like to take a lap around the place to see what options I have to not overeat a particular type of food. This buffet offers so much variety as it doesn't just specialize in one cuisine. There are separate sections for all types of international cuisines. Having said that though, with experience I have noticed that when a restaurant tries to do so much the food ends up being mediocre but never anything great. And the buffet at the ARIA did just that. 

Here are some notable things I had throughout the meal. 
-There was a pho station, which was pretty unique. I don't see those often in buffets.
-In the back corner, there was a carving station for meat that was nicely sitting under a heat lamp. It kept the meat was nice and tender.
-The Italian section was definitely lacking as was the Japanese sushi section. The pasta was dry and overcooked and there were literally three sushi rolls in the Japanese section, a cucumber roll being one of them. Would definitely skip over this.
-They have crab legs here! Most of them were pretty meatless but hey they're still pretty expensive so its totally worth it. 
-Everything came in small bowls already so it was perfectly portioned controlled so you could leave room in your stomach for everything else!
-The dessert section was probably the best thing here. They have beautiful displayed desserts and a rotating gelato stand. So many different flavors to choose from!

Another gripe I have is that you have to pay for parking in the ARIA. When most hotels offer free parking for customers who want to go to the casino or eat at one of the many restaurants in their hotel, this is not an appealing way to attract customers. 

Overall, a pretty average Vegas buffet with quality and pricing. I think they are trying to do too much. As much as they are giving customers variety, they are giving up on quality. Definitely come for the crab legs and gelato.",1,1,1

So, I would have rated it one star.  The food and service was as ugly as it gets.  Food tasted a day old.  The server couldn't do a simple task of refilling beverages.  Luckily, the manager was kind enough to refund my thirty-eight dollars.  I told myself that I would come back after a good amount of time, so they could take their one star ratings, and turn them into fives.

And now, I am back a year later.  The service is the same. Surprisingly, the food improved just enough to give them an extra star difference!  Come on, Aria.  Do you really want to market yourself as the center of Las Vegas, when you can't do a buffet correctly?  Yeah you have crab legs, but even the Mcdonalds of buffets have them these days.

It was pretty terrible, I don't really have a way to say it nicely.  Service was slow to respond on clearing and refills,  hamburgers and meat section were lacking flavor and dry, crab section was small and not refilled adequately or timely, Asian and Mediterranean section kind of just seems like a waste. The small plates were okay I enjoyed the braised beef on Mash, but I was really just shocked at the overall low quality and undesirable dishes served. 

There's little to zero chance I'd come back. The dessert section was cute but I don't really go to buffets for the desserts. I also appreciate that the bathroom was in side the restaurant.",2,1,1

It can be the most disgusting place in the world and i'd still find something great about it. Giving a 3 star rating is kind of a stretch but it wasn't 2 star bad so there you go. 

Came in for the lunch buffet my last day in vegas, a bit sad to go and a heck of a lot sadder I couldnt hit up several more buffets but girls gotta party and full stomachs + clubbing dress dont really mix. For $25 per, this place wasnt so bad, with food ranging from japanese, mexican, italian.. etc. Im assuming one has been to a buffet before. 

Things to skip:
-sushi rolls .. with very little emphasis on the sushi part.. actually, scratch that.. no sushi in sight, just a couple of rice rolled in seaweed with vegetable stuffings. blaaaand. dry. stuck together. disgusting
-ceviche .. smelly little cups of ""seafood"" and vegetables in vinegar
-kimchi .. next to the chinese food section, the only korean thing there. disappointing. bland. and just plain wrong
-some type of nacho .. cheese, beef, salsa.. sitting on top of some corn chips which by the way turned soggy by the time I scooped some up

Things to try:
-omelets .. they make them on the spot for you so you really can't go wrong
-waffles .. hated the other breakfast items but the waffles were perfect!!
-roast meats .. selection of beef, turkey, pork. I got the roast beef with aju and horseradish which was the best thing there
-dessert .. at first glance, I thought they had a huge selection but there were maybe 6 cakes and the rest were cookies and danish. Loved the apple pie, banana cream pie, and strawberry cheesecake 
-gelato .. the lemon sorbet!!

Things that were eh:
-crab legs .. it wasn't bad.. it wasn't good.. it was just meh
-chinese food .. 
-soups

Overall, the place wasn't horrible but wish i'd gone to the buffet at the bellagio or mandalay bay. Should've just stuck around for the dinner at another buffet anyway since the drive back took 7 freaking hours due to serious traffic!!

Also, after trying Bacchanal (Caesar's Palace) and Wicked Spoon (Cosmopolitan), everything else is also-rans. They have to create an amazing experience or a dish that would match or better the two that I mentioned. 

Don't get me wrong here, the place is nice, clean, spacious and bright and the dishes are nicely prepared with their own sections. 

But it lacks that umph. Yes, they have every kind of similar food items served at other buffet places, and one would expect something elegant, especially located inside the Aria.

It made the whole experience cheap.  Like he was a street vendor trying to sell me food.. omg..

Nothing stood out except the dessert macaroons. The dessert section is good, however not enough to warrant a repeat visit. Word of mouth is important and the words that will be coming out of my mouth regarding this buffet are not good.

Crab was good, Sushi was dry and tasteless (for tourists) and don't touch the Raw, dry salmon, get the root word here, SALMON-ella. Salad bar, boring, Meats? undercooked, Indian, OK, Pizza? The same junk like other buffets, how could this be at a nice fancy place? The pasta, chesses, grilled veggies, again boring and some where dry. Chinese food? a few acceptable items, but mostly bland and nothing special. Bread, cheese, this that...nothing great. Desserts looked impressive, but none being noteworthy. Please get rid of that fancy curved plate! It's not functional in a buffet setting and some of the corners were chipped. There are other reviews here beaming about the dessert, but surely we didn't see what was so special about it.
Service was barely acceptable. A dessert fork would have been nice since you only get a single fork the entire meal. I used my teaspoon. We noticed some people got up to get some dessert and when they returned to their seat the table was cleared and new customers sitting it their place. So the seating system needs some practice. I had to ask for a drink refill and the bussing of the tables were good and bad. Also when a patron is eating crab legs, maybe offer a extra plate for the shells?

The food was amazinig! Everything was fresh and the meats,fish, pasta, chicken, and some other entrees were cooked to order. The sushi selection was amazing, and the grilled salmon was like butter in my mouth! Ahhhhh I wish I there was something comparable in Los Angeles!

Filet mignon, New York steak, roasted lamb, and grilled chicken....oh my....my mouth waters at the recollection.
Dessert selection is truly endless! They carry the tasiest cakes, pies, chocolate mousse, and ice cream any sweet-toothed person can enjoy.

Especially considering they charged almost double ($38.99 for just breakfast) for Easter weekend but woefully lack the quality to warrant that price, they seriously need to get their shit together. 

It makes me furious that the scrambled eggs at their diner station is MADE OF EGG POWDER. Sure, there's an omelet station nearby so you probably wouldn't be getting your eggs from there anyway, but just the sheer fact that they had the nerve to put an atrocity even a self-respecting $15 buffet won't commit on display really makes me question how they think they deserve their ""exclusively excessive"" slogan. The yogurt they serve is also some genuinely low-quality sugary crap, that I had to spit it out after tasting just one spoonful. 

As for their claim to serving ""world wide cuisine""... it's not wrong, if a small selection of pizza counts as Italian, some lo mien in carry out paper cartons and fried rice that looks like it's been fried for 2 weeks counts as Asian, and half cooked plantains caramelized in syrup instead of brown sugar (which tastes disgusting, btw) plus a taco bar counts as Latin. 

The only thing that might help the Buffet justify its price tag is how they serve large shrimps, but even those are hidden beneath piles and piles of mussels and are quite a hassle to dig out.

Came here at 3:15pm for dinner food at the lunch price because that's how I fly.

PROS:
+Better quality prime rib than most buffets that advertise ""Prime Rib"". 

+Pretty good King Crab (not the twice frozen junk at Bellagio where you are biting into a king crab popsicle)

+Fresh salmon nigiri (rice under it was cold and hard so I had no problem turning it into sashimi)

+Excellent coffee

+Good service

CONS: 
-Some items they just didn't rotate out. Not that I'd eat pizza at a ""higher-end"" buffet but having the same pizza with the cold hard cheese sitting there for almost 2 hours didn't present well (The pizza at Bachannal buffet is REALLY good, however).

-Desserts. 
From the small selection that they had, it seemed like anything that looked good was made in a way to appeal to a small amount of people. Either ""Gluten Free"" or ""Sugar Free""...but I just want it to taste good...that's why I came here in the first place...don't need sweetener substitutes that make this thing less than it could be. 

Also, I'm tired of buffets putting out cupcakes to fill an entire area of the desert section ( I'm looking at you, Planet Hollywood!). I love cupcakes, but if you've ever had a buffet cupcake, you'll know it wasn't made that day or even the day before. It's not moist and it's just a mistake to put on your plate. Well, the whole top row here was cupcakes. 

The ice cream ""wheel of flavors"" didn't come near to the quality they have at Bachannal which is really top notch...another dessert disappointment.

Unfortunately, the quality (of both the Asian and non-Asian food) was not that good. They do have a lot of different options, but for the price, I expect higher quality food in addition to the variety. Most of their entrees were forgettable. A few things make it 3 stars vs 2.

The good: 
+ The crab was good, but steamed crab is pretty common at this type of buffets. 
+ The made-to-order pasta. My husband liked the (red) sauce and the sun dried tomatoes.
+ The french toast was tasty. Fluffy and with the right amount of sweet and syrup - not overpowering.
+ The sesame balls! Cute sized, good texture and taste.
+ The nachos. Not really paying for an all-you-can-eat nacho bar though.

The meh:
- Oily stir fry. I liked that they used wood ear mushrooms, but it was too greasy to enjoy.
- The leaf-wrapped rice & chicken. While a unique offering, it tasted bland. 
- The Indian food. Back home, we can get all-you-can-eat Indian buffets for $12 that taste better, so I didn't bother filling up on stuff that wasn't at least equal.
- Non-distinct seafood dishes. It seemed like they put out two different clam\/mussel entrees to look like they offered more, but in reality, the sauces didn't taste that much different.
- Not that many interesting vegetarian dishes. All I can remember is a broccoli and cheese dish. Maybe some snap peas too.
- Unsatisfying desserts. Neither my husband or I wanted to finish the ice cream. We tried a couple other things (flan, cookies, cannoli) but nothing did it for us. (I was excited about the flan too!) It sucks to spend a lot of money and leave still wanting to buy something else.

Bathrooms were nice. Hostesses were kinda meh. Overall, I'd come back if I was in the ARIA and I wanted to gain five or six pounds.",3,1,0

For $45 a person I was expecting the same experience, but it was more like a food court with a few highlights.  I was really surprised at how small it was although I'm not sure more food would have necessarily been better.  The dessert selection was great and it took up about 1\/3 of the whole place.  There were a few stations with about 5 foods at each station.  The Asian stop had some decent gyoza, a leak cake, some dumplings, and other fare that looked like low quality take out.  The seafood stand was the highlight with king crab legs that were already sliced in half.  You could easily just pull out the meat.  There were four different types of sushi which were okay and the rest of the fish was overcooked and low quality.  There was a salad buffet, Mediterranean, Latin, and American section.  One star for the crab legs and another for the servers who were very friendly.  Nothing else was really all that impressive.  I definitely wouldn't go back.",1,0,0

It was ""gourmet dinner"" night which was $38.99 so my friend I decided to go back downstairs and gamble a little and come right before they did their lunch-dinner swap(lunch=19.99).  Upon entering you see the seafood selection and got giddy. it loooked Amazing: oysters, raw clams HUGE shrimp(wynn doesn't even serve shrimp at lunch anymore) crablegs etc.  Walked around and saw prime rib,   Leg of lamb and all tht good stuff. I figured heck, this is just the normal lunch, I should wait till they change it up for gourmet dinner. So from 3:45-4:30 I made a huge mistake, selfish I guess.. I only had me a plate of seafood thinking by the time I was done everything woul be swapped. So while I waited I realized that everyhing here only looks nice, and looks can be decieving. The oysters and clams were unfresh and had that very unpleasant seafood taste, the sashimi was sliced paper thin( unlike bellagio generous portions). Things started to go downhill from there. I got up to get a slice of prime rib and wth! They took it away and replaced it with 2 turkeys, the leg of lamb was gone and replaced by skirt steak. Reallly really overcooked and tough skirt steak. ( even though he said he was giving me the more rare piece).  I walked around the buffet to see what else had changed from normal lunch to "" gourmet dinner"" and was suprised to see that everything pretty much stayed the same. I n√©ed to stop my rant now, i'm still at Aria but figured i should do my yelping duties and warn others of this overyhyped, overpriced buffet. I mean, $19.99 isn't bad but don't spend almost $40 for dinner. you're pretty much getting the same food you would have gotten at MGM at double the price :( if you want buffet  go to Wynn or Bellagio.

Food:
+Excellent variety of foods. You got your pizzas (I wanted to try the Margherita pizza, but no room!), your Indian foods (tandoori chicken and curry and basmati rice and such), your Chinese foods(which I think were done quite well! I guiltily enjoyed my chow fun and friend rice, even knowing how cheaply filling they were), little noodle cups(the green tea soba noodles with peanut chicken was my fave), sushi(not an awesome selection, but it's there), sliced and carved meats, king and snow crab legs already sliced in their shell(though they were just average), a selection of cold meats and cheeses, etc...
+DESSERTS. I have an insatiable sweet tooth, so this really was the cherry on the cake for me. The chocolate-covered puff cereal\/marshmallow clusters were simple and delicious, the creme brulee wasn't fancy but I still loved me some runny custard, and the Grand Marnier creme puff was beautifully decorated and awesomely edible, every part. What else...they had bananas foster, fancy schmancy whoopie pies, blondies, cobblers, cheesecakes...soooo many options!
+Free red wine? I think I heard that right. It was offered to me, but I declined, so I can't say much about that.

Service:
-Not great. Sat there for a little while after we were seated, and no one came so we just went to get our food. We were probably halfway through our first plates when we finally got our waters.

Other:
+\/- They automatically bring lobster to your table, even if you don't ask for it. Good if you like lobster(it's nothing exceptional, though. I found it to be dry, but not terrible), bad if you're already full by that time or not a lobster fan and then you feel sorry letting lobster go to waste.
- Plan to get there a little early if you think you'll be hungry. This is not a walk-up-and-get-your-food buffet. There is a line, and you wait to be seated. They will also seat people who are behind you in line if they have tables for parties of that size.
- $40 a person. In this case, buffet != cheap eats. I think the variety of food offered made it worth the price, but just be aware of this going in.

Overall:
Expensive but probably justifiably so. Service not great. Variety was awesome, but quality of food varied. Not all great, but there were some gems in there, and if you're a foodie, it's pretty fun to try everything and find some delicious stuff.",0,0,0

The ham and pork belly at the carving station were tender and not salty. I recommend the pork belly it's guaranteed to make you as fat as you desire. Red velvet pancakes were delicious and the Nutella was warm and flowing decadently.

This past weekend might not be the best indicator as I paid a $10 premium ($47.95) because it was Labor day weekend.  However, with the 37.95 price in mind, I'll do this review.

This really has only one competitor, and that is the Wynn Buffet.  Let's do a head to head with that.  Definitely a notch below bacchanal and Wicked spoons like others have mentioned.

Seafood - 

The Wynn was lacking in this department.  Please see my other review.  Basically, cold king crab legs, not-so-fresh oysters, so-so sushi.
The Aria did not do much better; however, they offered two types of crab legs including a cold and hot selection.  Match that with the cocktail shrimp and muscles... this round is by far in favor of the Aria.  There was a few other things but it escapes me right now.
winner - Aria

Carvery -

The Wynn wins hands down - but with a catch.  They were able to serve the best prime rib i've had on the strip.  Of course, it is a little hit or miss, but the piece I received was perfect.  
The Aria was terrible.  All the meats, sausages, chicken, ""new york steak,""  and lamp were overcooked.  The cook, who i talked to, explained that the prime rib isn't cooked at the same kitchen and is kept warm under a heat lamp before being rolled out.  It explains the overcooked prime rib.  However, there was a surf and turf station so unique to the Vegas strip that it nearly pulls this one out of the gutter.  The sirloin steak is prepped separately and was THE BEST steak i've had on the strip.  Easily comparable to restaurant steak I've eaten in SF or downtown LA.   The dish alone, with the lobster topping is probably worth $15 alone.  If the prime rib was half as good as this, I'd be telling you to go to the Aria right now.  WIth that said, I don't think it was enough to pull a win over the wynn.
Winner - Wynn

Variety -

Wynn had a decent variety.  I liked its unique salad creations, its variety of meats and of course its desserts.  However, it was still limited in uniqueness.

The aria had variety indeed.  It showcases indian cuisines which is pretty unique.  Their Nan bread is good and so is the humus.  There wasn't an abundance of things for indian food though.  The aria also displayed lobster bisque, tomato basil, and new england clam chowder.  I've had better clam chowder, but that's a different topic.  I would say it was on par with the wynn.  As mentioned in the carvery, the surf and turf station stands out prominently.  So for that reason, i'll give this round to the Aria.
winner - aria

dessert -

Just go to the wynn.  Nothing really special at the Aria.  
winner - dessert

VALUE-

Ok, so if I had 37.95 to spend... this is tough.  I would say the aria because I just expect so much more when I go to the wynn.  The service and decor is better at the Aria.  Everytime I left the table, my seat was cleared of all my previous plates.  That's impressive.  I'm also asked if I would like another ""drink"" every so often, at which point I am able to change my orange juice to a soda.  I don't often really like to keep drinking orange juice throughout the meal.

Is this really a 4 star place?  Not really, but there's enough people leaving 1 star on here that if I gave it a 4 it wouldn't hurt.  They're definitely not an AVERAGE (3 star) buffet.

Some stuff had clearly been sitting out too long, I saw some salami that looked like it was beginning to grow some new vegetation for the restaurant. The crab legs were good, the curries were a little bland, the sushi was basic rolls that you would find at a low end Chinese buffet.

The prime rib was good, as were some of the pasta selections. The crab legs were dry...

However, considering how much I like Aria, I figured that their buffet would have to be on my list of spots to check out.  After all, if their buffet can match the hotel, then it must be pretty decent right?  So, after checking out their menu and being decently satisfied, some of my friends and I ended up coming on a Thursday night to give them a shot.  

After paying and making our way in, I already started to get an ominous feeling though.  Now, I don't know about you...but I generally get worried when I start having doubts before I even make it to my seat.  Why so worried?  Well, although the spaciousness of the dining area might have had something to do with it, the buffet seemed pretty empty to me.  Though I didn't expect it to be a madhouse like how it is at some Asian buffets, I figured there would at least be a steady stream of people shuttling back and forth between the food and their tables.  In this case, not so much.   Refreshing as it was to be able to reach for the serving utensil without someone right on my ass waiting for me to finish, it made me wonder if all those missing people knew something I didn't.  

Like most Vegas buffets, they have a decent variety of selections to cover just about every diner that should pass through the place.  From the usual buffet staples to Asian selections to Mexican food, they cover a lot of territory.  The question isn't so much what you want, but what is worth eating - like your choices, the quality varies as well.  For the most part, the food is fine - nothing terrible, but nothing that drives you back up there for seconds or thirds.  The Mexican food was pretty bad, though I like the chips and guacamole\/salsa bar.  Then again, at a Vegas buffet, that's probably not the sort of thing you want to be chasing.  

Among the few things that were of note, I thought that the prime rib was better than average for a buffet.  The seasoning on the outside was pretty good, and it was still juicy and tender.  The star though, if you're a fan, is the fresh crab legs they have.  Haven't seen all of the buffets in Vegas, but it's one of the few that I recall seeing crab legs at, and it's certainly the best that comes to mind.  They were very fresh and tasted great, and it's always handy when they slice it all the way through so it's easier to pick the meat out.  Hassle free crab legs?  Sign me up please!

All in all, the buffet isn't terrible, and it's definitely worth checking out if you like crab legs.  Just that in Vegas, with so many other choices (relatively) close, you're probably better off heading over to Cosmopolitan or Wynn.",9,6,9

What I Had: Weekend Brunch ($41 total) 

Food Review:  Was unimpressed. I am convinced that the $41 price tag is mostly due to a premium to avoid the wait. The $35 (before tax) buffet at the Wynn trumped Aria by a long shot. Their asian food was gross: the chow mein was soo salty, the dumplings were strangely chewy\/rubbery on the edges, and their fried rice had too much soy sauce. The breakfast food was average. The sushi was maybe TroGro level sushi or similar to Safeway sushi. I was disappointed with their breakfast burrito as well, which was so saturated with hot sauce that I couldn't taste any of the components like egg or sausage. 

I will say that the desserts here, solely in terms of taste, were for the most part just as good as the buffet at the Wynn. I had their strawberry cheesecake with white chocolate, and it was delish. 

Service Review: Self serve. 

Venue Review: Although there was no line whatsoever and plenty of seating (chairs and booths), the buffet had to be at least half the size (or maybe even a third or quarter the size!) of the buffet at the Wynn. They also didn't have much unique selection (e.g., the buffet at the Wynn has croquettes and other cool and normally high-value items). 

Overall Impression: Unsatisfactory! Aside from the clean and classy decor in the Aria, the buffet had little to offer, especially compared to that of the top buffets on the strip, and especially at that price.",0,0,0

However, we were a little shocked when the price was $39.95 for dinner, especially when our Wicked Spoon Buffet (in the Cosmopolitan), the night before, was $34. Shortly after being seated, we did not hesitate the price. Every person got their own lobster tail (already pre-sliced in half) and unlimited wine! The buffet was great and offered snow and king crab legs (also pre-sliced in half). They had plenty to choose from, even for me, who was on a pretty strict diet of no carbs and no sweets. We found out shortly after that the lobster and unlimited wine was only a Saturday night (or weekends, I don't remember) special. So, I definitely recommend trying to go around that time.

We did end up going to The Buffet at Aria for breakfast for $17. It wasn't bad, just not worth the $17. However, we did get to breakfast late and they started changing up the food for lunch, which meant we also got to fill up on lunch food for the price of a breakfast buffet!

I only found out two days later the Aria self parking is near the entrance to Crystals SMH. So cool how both buffets I went to this past weekend were orange in decor.

points on their player's card, which can be redeemed for a buffet meal. $10 off for NV\/Vegas residents!
Our waitress, Luz, is super friendly AND hardworking-- she was the only one working in our area, constantly taking away used plates, busing her tables, wiping them down, placing new cloth napkins & silverware, warm smile never faltering. 

Food! A variety of stations, the usual American, seafood on ice (crab legs, shrimp, crab claws, 2 kinds of mussels, clams), a bit of pasta, Mexican & Asian fare, surprisingly had Indian and Mediterranean options. I saw a few curries and basmati rice. The dessert bar had a spinning ice cream display. Most buffets I've visited have linguica sausage and hand carved meats. Wedge salads! Blue cheese dressing tho. 

My plates had:

Mushroom & truffle pizza
New England clam bake-- have never eaten that many clams before!
Shrimp & grits
Paella-- Latin rice dish with mixed shellfish, sausage
Saut√©ed string beans
Carnitas
Creamed spinach cheese? Dip with crunchy chips!!
Freshly baked naan! I added garlic hummus & tzatziki.

*Thai tea and watermelon lime strawberry juice were offered at the buffet the day I went! Just missing honey boba pearls for the Thai tea.

Serving King Crab and Roast Beef (usually reserved for a dinner buffet) isn't what makes it special.  They have (or had then) one of the top 10 Chocolatiers in the world.  

Usually at a buffet the dessert island looks like it was set up through a production line process.  Not this place.  EVERYTHING looked awesome, and (what I tried) tasted even better than it looked.

My wife had a chocolate shooter and exclaimed ""this is so good that they should require a prescription for it.""

We had to limit ourselves because something that damn tasty cannot be good for you.  I am not normally a dessert person but it was phenomenal.  

Due to the fact that too much sugar is not healthy. I usually (if ever) do not eat dessert, and if I do it wouldn't be more than 1 dessert servings at any one meal. It was so good I had 2 & 1\/2 servings (I had to taste to see if it was as delicious as it looked [and it was]).

I basically stuck around the section with all the crab legs. Now you know what I eat the most. Lol. They were fresh as it was packed around ice. The beauty of these crab legs wasn't about its size, but how they're already cut in half for you to easily consume. Delicious! 

Other items I've tried was the roasted beef (not prime rib), roasted chicken, smoked salmon,  spicy tuna sushi roll, broccoli, pepperoni pizza, their dim sum sieu mais (dumping), the tossed green Cesar Salad, and finally their fresh fruits.

I don't know why they call their beef ""roasted beef"" rather than using the fancy prime rib. Maybe it was a different area of the cow? But that huge roasted slab of meat did look wonderful.  But I think they should have let the meat absorb the marinated flavor a bit longer since it wasn't too flavorful in the mid cut. 

Believe it or not, aside from the crab legs, I probably enjoyed the salad and the fresh fruits the most. It look so fresh that I had to indulge. Yep, I need my greens and vitamin C. 

It kind of sounds like I'm an oinker for eating so much which I actually am, but really I only took a small proportion of everything to try out. Yes, I was stuffed from the variety.

The buffet is well kept and very clean. I wouldn't worry too much about getting food poisoning since they deal with huge volumes. So the probability of something getting spoiled is rare.

My only complaint was that we dined on a Friday morning (August 29th) for Brunch, and they had already upped the price for the 'holiday' - Labor Day was Monday, September 1st.  $39 for a Brunch is a bit steep, considering most buffets on the Strip charge this much for a Dinner. But once we sat down to eat, I comforted myself with the fact that I would soon be indulging in delightful delicacies for brekky.

Which is exactly what I did. Orange juice and coffee flowed forth on a constantly refilled basis and we had a view of the pool area and greenery which was beautiful. My first course consisted of bagels with butter and cream cheese, croissants and smoked salmon. I moved on to the eggs, bacon, sausages, carnitas (yes, for breakfast), then I dived head first into the dessert section of the brunch offerings. Waffles with bowls of freshly whipped cream, caramel flan, chocolate and vanilla gelato, chocolate and almond croissants. I bellied up to the buffet one last time for another piece of smoked salmon but they had already taken it away to prepare for the lunch items which starts at 11am.

Dazed and confused, I finally made my way back to our table with a look on my face of utter satisfaction...sugar, fat, protein and caffeine induced food coma. 

I also saw congee and all manner of accompaniments, dim sum, lo-mein, egg rolls, fish, a whole table dedicated to Mexican food, Italian section of pizza and pasta and I was so sad I couldn't eat another thing. 

This restaurant is supremely clean, inviting, modern, neat and organized, and being inside the Aria hotel made it even more spectacular. The line was not too long even for a Friday. Since we stayed at the Aria, coming down from our room to have breakfast was a wonderful treat, instead of hiking it halfway down the Strip without so much as a drop of coffee and a parched feeling upon arrival.

The facility is beautiful and they have a very wide selection. If you are a crab legs person, then this place is for you!!! I LOVE crab legs and whenever I see them, I tend to eat several plates. So to elaborate on these legs.... they are very fresh and warm. There is no water that leaks out of them when you crack them open. In fact, there is hardly anything that drips out. All you get is the nice warm, soft, crab meat on the inside which is not typical of the lower end crab leg buffets. They also help you out by cutting part of the crab leg shell so that it is very easy to break apart to get to the meat. This made it really easy for me to down a bunch of awesome legs before getting full. I know, I know.. I'm biased but if I had to recommend ANY buffet for crab leg lovers, it would be this one HANDS DOWN

As for the other stuff... they are decent. Just decent. I think that is why the rating dropped a little bit here. The dessert is good but not amazing. They have gelato though. However, this is probably the only buffet where my technique to get the best flavor failed. I like to ask the server for their favorite flavor or the most popular flavor. The answer I got was ""Oh... I like them all!"" My follow up question of the most popular flavor by customers from what he has seen was ""they are all good!""...... USELESS! LOL

We're Las Vegas locals and try and hit most of the Strip and off Strip restaurants, buffets included. We gave it a whirl for Saturday night dinner buffet. 
First stop  ..the centrally located Seafood island. We got a sampling of crab legs, oysters on the half shell, yellowtail sushi etc. The crab was mushy, I also got a few bad oysters (mushy too), the sushi was passable. 
Next we hit the rest of the lines offerings. 
Skipping most to try a few items I normally like. Tried the obligatory Prime Rib, which was fine, but certainly not as good as a stand alone Prime Rib restaurant. Tandoori chicken was next.  The chicken was ok, but very dry. I then got a few slices of deli salami.  All were overly chewy and had a funny taste. At that point I went on to some melon , all of which were totally unripe and tasted like cardboard. 
I finally went to the desert station and got a small sampling of baked goods. They were ok, but I have to say I was disappointed that they had no ice cream to complement the Bananas Foster. In all fairness they told me the machine was broken. 
All in all, I would say the meal was mediocre.

Not dry and actually has a nice piece of Rare to offer, which is not common at most buffet joints. Crab legs are decent not the best grade, but again buffet,  Service was good, plates are cleaned off and drinks are brought to us constantly.  

Carvery station: Prime Rib Roast, Ribs, Sausage, Chicken, Leg of Lamb and basic sides of creme spinach, corn, mac and cheese, mash and baked potatoes

Asian station: Chow mein, fried rice, Pho, dumplings, har gow (shrimp dumpling), and asian server

Mexican station: tacos, tortilla and some carne 

Indian station: they have a roti machine,  so they serve up some curry, masala, tandoori chick and some garlic nan (by the way pretty good). 

Italian station: just opt for the fresh pasta and bypass everything else, unless you want to grab a slice of pizza. Don't use your hands please, the server will yell at you. 

Seafood station: two side bar, so one side serves hot crab, mussels and vice versa on the other side, they do offer oysters as well (i made it w\/out being sick) so even if it doesn't look good, consume at your own risk.  Spanish seafood rice didn't try, but looks good. 

Desert station: gelato, but melts quick, macaroons, cheescake etc.

I am not one to moan and complain about something but being in the industry I feel I need to give feedback about my buffet experience since Aria takes so much pride in it.

Granite the buffet was free, this was a horrible experience.  I am not complaining because I want anything free or I am trying to down your casino\/buffet.  You have a wonderful casino, from gambling options to hotel, to awesome guest relations but your buffet needs improvement, a lot!

When I came into Vegas all I have been seeing on advertisement is how good your buffet is.  I don't have a really high standard for buffets but when I visited Wicked Spoon last year at the Cosmo, the bar went through the roof.  I never try to compare buffets but when one hits the fan such as your I want to notify your establishment.  I always wanted to check out Aria's buffet because how you acclaim that it is amazing, so I decided to give it a try.

To start me off, how you list your food options on the chalkboard is definitely creative but hard to digest.  Digest being the board sometimes is in the middle of the option food bar and trying to distinguish which item is which becomes a little tough especially when there is a line of people behind you and you don't want to hold them up.

The choices were not neaten and seemed a little trashy like a Home Buffet.  The food at best was par and the lady cutting the prime rib told me my piece of meat was med\/rare when clearly it was medwell+.  I wasn't going to argue with her because there was a line behind me and I am easy going but that is the first time I didn't finish a piece of A1-Prime rib.  It was dry and not appealing.

Your Asian selection was definitely below par.  Half the food didn't taste fresh and the steam pork bun was super dry.

The only plus side was your seafood selection.  I mean it is hard to mess up cold seafood but it was the only and the best part of dinner.

The worst part of about the experience was the server Victoria.  She seems like a nice lady but if she was doing full service she would crash.  I don't know if she was overwhelmed or was behind but it is not that hard to grab a spoon or listen to a specific drink request which she both botched. My guest and I asked her for a spoon two separate times and she did not return with one.  She didn't get the drink request right and she barely came by to clear done items off the table.  I still left her a good tip because it was a free buffet but that left a sour taste in my mouth.  I served before and it is almost an insult that she fails at a buffet which is the easiest serving job in a world.

If someone was to ask me to recommend a buffet to them in Las Vegas I would not say yours until it improves.

Came around 4pm and there was no line. Make sure to bring your M-life card...I forgot mine, you could get the points. 

The first thing I head for was the prime rib. I loved it. Juicy, moist, tender, flavorful...it can't get any better than that. Our waiter was really awesome she was quick on clearing plates and letting us know that each person gets half a lobster. Great lobster. It was really small though but half a lobster is good for one person. The crab legs were my next pit stop. There were two kinds: snow crab legs and king crab legs. I personally liked the king crab legs because they were bigger and they were sliced in half, so we didn't have to use any tools but our fingers to take the meat out. The legs were juicy and it had a good amount of flavor. If it's too much spray some lemon it. Another great part of the buffet is dessert! So delicious. I wanted to get everything. I had the bananas foster, bread pudding, flan, and some cheesecake. Bread pudding was good but not what I expected. I truly loved the egg part of the flan but not the sauce paired with it. Why couldn't it just be a normal caramel sauce? But instead it had an orange-y flavor. They also have gelato I can't even remember what flavor I got.

From our hotel, you can either walk outside and use the sidewalk or to avoid the hot temperatures you can use the Tram (air conditioned every step of the way).

We were hungry and decided to stop by for brunch.  Personally, brunch gives you more bang for your buck.  The price can seem steep but they have a huge display of food from just about every country for lunch and made to order omelets and breakfast items in case you wanted both lunch and dinner.  We paid $28.99 per person.  Breakfast is $20.99 and Dinner is $38.99 during the week.  Prices increase during the weekend and during the holidays.

They also offer an unlimited drink option for $19.99 for 2 people.  This covers a selection of mixed drinks and sodas.

As far as service goes, the lines are a little long and if you plan to eat during the normal times then you can expect a wait so try to arrive early.  We waited in line for about 20-25 minutes.  Their service was great.  For each section you're assigned a server and ours was very attentive.  I tried just about every item from each country and all tasted pretty good.  I was a little disappointed about the crab legs (I'm extremely picky about my seafood) but they were bland and dry.

The buffet is known for its international buffet stations and has all cuisines you can think of including Greek, Mexican, American, Italian, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Indian, and Mediterranean. I'm pretty sure I'm missing some cuisines but bear with me lol.

I was impressed with their seafood station. They have a huge selection of crab legs, several different types of shellfish, shrimp, fish, crawfish. I know I got my money's worth on just the seafood alone. The seafood is what makes this place shine!

They had a carving station but I was not a fan of their meat. Their steak was dry but flavorful. Other meat they had including the sausage, short rib, and ham were decent though.

The dessert station will satisfy any sweet tooth. It was one of the most expansive dessert selections I've seen at a buffet. I wanted to get one of each but won't fit on one plate! The dessert selection is on par with Bacchanal Buffet I'd say.

My review is based on what I inhaled or tasted.. lol...there is so much food it's overwhelming!  But what else can you expect at a buffet.  

I'm a seafood fan, and they had a good variety of seafood, such as reg crab legs (hot or cold), king crab!!!!, large shrimp, mussels, scallop ceviche, shrimp cocktail (large shrimp too!), and clams.  (During my first visit they also had oysters and lobster.)  I spent most of my time around the crab legs.. With clarified butter..yum!  The shrimp cocktails were also good, the sauce is just right, and not over-powered by horseradish.

I love Sushi!  However, the selection they had today was sub-par and not even tempting enough to taste.  Rolls I can remember: masago, California, vegetable...

As for the meat selection they had.. pork shoulder, bbq beef brisket, rotisserie chicken,  prime rib.. (I couple of other items i cant remember). I tried the BBQ beef brisket and pork shoulder.  Out of both the BBQ brisket was delish, tender, and juicy!  

Other memorable items, freshly made pita bread, cheese station, Asian food station which included chow mein, beef broccoli, Mexican, salad bar...and that about it.

Love the dessert station, bananas foster had just the right amount of rum, they have a good selection of gelato, similar to M buffet.  The carrot cake was slightly dry, coconut cream cake was too sweet, and the cheesecake was just right (fora buffet cheesecake).

I heard good things about the nearby Bellagii buffet, but there was an hour wait. I decided to take the tram to the beautiful new Aria to check out the buffet. The fact that there was no wait with a half empty restaurant should have been a warning sign.

The only thing about this meal that alluded to the fact that I was in a fine hotel was the unnecessarily heavy silverware and glass stemware for the water. After that, everything else was largely unimpressive. From the food to service, this could be a run of the mill buffet anywhere. It certainly does not fit the image that Aria is trying to convey. 

King crab legs - how could you go wrong? They were chilled and had an unappealing smell to them. The shrimp were set in a glass with what looked to be cocktail sauce, but it only tasted like ketchup. The buffet is long but rather boring. 

I'm chewing through valuable phone battery with this review, but if it keeps someone from spending $40 on a boring, sub par buffet, it's worth it. 

This has to be up there with one of most disappointing Vegas meals. 

Even if this meal had been comped, I would have still felt ripped off.

We had friends visiting and wanted to try out the Aria buffet. My boyfriend and I had never been there so we decided to give it a try. I was a bit embarrassed as you would think that for the price paid (it's WAY overpriced for the quality of food), the ambiance and the flair of Aria, the buffet would be dazzling and I pictured walking into a buffet that was over the top. It was far from. It looked like any buffet that you would go to downtown Fremont Street, namely, the Golden Nugget. The food looked as though it had been sitting for quite a while, not fresh and the serving stations were not very clean. 

The waitress that had our table was very nice as were the greeters at the front door. I will definitely give a thumbs up. However, had I known that the buffet was less than desirable, we would have taken them to the M Resort (which has an EXCELLENT buffet for half the price! and has an outstanding seafood night), or to the Red Rock Hotel\/Casino. Granted they are off the beaten path for tourists, but well worth the drive. The sad part is that tourists do not know the myriad of wonderful buffets that surround them... off the strip but yet, not a far driving distance. 

The desserts were good... there was a chocolate\/peanut butter dessert that was delish. So, for the dessert, I would say it was decent. 

We entertain friends visiting out of town quite often and we take them away from the strip and they are amazed at how many restaurants Las Vegas has. Sadly, those that are stuck on the strip end up paying outrageous prices for food that is not the quality they pay for. So, when we pick them up, or they meet up, it's away from the strip to some great local restaurants! 

Aria was a bit disappointing and hoping that the quality will get better. However, now we know, and in recommending food spots, that will not be one. NOT WORTH THE PRICE.",0,0,0

We were seated quickly, but unfortunately right below an air conditioning vent which froze me and cooled the food. . 

Our server Kyle brought drinks while we got food. He kept our dirty plates cleared and our glasses full. He had many tables to care for. 

Lots of fresh salad items--pears, goat cheese, roasted pumpkin, beets, wheat berries, melons, several dressings, etc. 

My favorite entree was the pot roast with mashed potatoes and carrots; it was cooked perfectly with lots of flavor. The masala and chicken curry with basmati rice were also delicious with naan bread, hummus and cucumber sauce (I can't spell the correct name). 

Creamed corn was a good side. 

My husband loved the tomato bisque soup, prime rib, crab legs and steamed clams with melted butter, Brussels sprouts, rotisserie chicken and sushi. 

The chicken taquitos and cheese lasagna were bland. 

They had a nice selections of desserts, including gluten free and sugar free pies, cakes, gelato, cookies, flan, pudding, cannoli, etc.

Once for brunch on Saturday and the following day for brunch again.  It was $28 a person plus an additional $6 for all you can drink mimosas.

Food was your standard Las Vegas brunch fare.  Crab legs, shrimp, breakfast foods, Asian dishes, made to order omelets, and a carving station.  The eggs benedict was a hit and miss for me.  The first batch had perfectly poached eggs, while the other batch I had was a bit overcooked.  Could have been the result of sitting out under a heat lamp.  The top round was mediocre.  I enjoyed the french toast with white chocolate creme anglaise.  The only dessert I tried was the strawberry cheesecake which I found to be okay.

Because honestly, I eat, and I want to know. The M is on my list...any others? Seriously, I only eat in Vegas, so I need more to do.

But the Aria buffet, compared to the other major casino's buffet along the strip is the best one that I've had - taking into account price and quality (better and cheaper than Wynn). It was around $32 per person for dinner on a weeknight.

There's something nice about the fact that it's not just food piled on top of food, you know? Because some buffets just do that. HERE'S A BUNCH OF FOOD and it looks great for feasting with your eyes, but taste wise...eeeeeeeh.

Aria's is clean and arranged in a way where food looks delicious (and sanitary), but not in the NOW GO STUFF YOURSELF sort of way. Though, okay, the crab legs are done as such, but did you guys see the chickens? LINED UP FOR YOU! The cocktail shrimp even comes in little glass cups - but only one to a glass (wish it was at least three).

Okay, and you know how Vegas buffet sushi usually sucks? The rice is hard and cold (why would you even allow yourself to serve that?), the Aria one is actually pretty decent. I actually contemplated getting more.

The salads were creative tasted fresh. The build your own pasta was decent (if you want to try but save space for other buffet-type things, ask for half the usual amount). The seafood ravioli looks pretty average and gross, and I would have skipped it had the lady next to me not ooze about how good it was yesterday and just HAD to come back. So I tried it, and it actually tasted...fresh? Not fresh out of ocean fresh, but it was good.

I tried the Indian. They had a nice (I believe) Cantonese lady making the Indian, so while one of the dishes was great and spicy (and completely unauthentic), the chick peas were watery. Also, the garlic na'an, while delicious, did not have the consistency of na'an...more like the Chinese\/Taiwanese green onion pancakes.

And the dessert. *sigh* the best part. What an amazing presentation. I wanted to try all of it. I actually did get about 8 desserts (not exaggerating) for my table of 4, and I personally did major work on all of them. They're fantastic. Great flavors, not too sweet, and not overly heavy. I LOVE creme brulee and would always get it at buffets and order it at restaurants. Until I found out how to make it. Then I just realized it wasn't worth it. But somehow, the dessert masters at Aria made it taste incredibly light for a creme brulee. My favorite, though, is the bread pudding. I just thought of it a few minutes ago, leading me to write this review. Love it! The apple crumble was not my favorite. But what I appreciated was that you can taste the real honey they used in it (probably from France, because they provided a small jar of honey from France for our tea). You can easily remedy the over powering honey in the crumble with a scoop of gelato =)

Since no food is worth waiting 3 Hours for, we immediately called the buffet at Aria and were told that there was less than a 15 minute wait time.

1) Our waitress was super nice. There was no high chair for Ian, so she kept on looking and informing us every couple of minutes that she was still looking. She finally managed to nab a high chair and bring it to us. (+1)

The menu looked promising and we had moderate expectations given that this was a new hotel of the MGM Mirage group that would likely have some experience with pushing food at buffets - but we were sadly, sadly disappointed.

THE BAD:

First off, there the buffet line and stations are very utilitarian and remind you of a cafeteria - not a whole lot of good interior design went into designing this space and they wanted to seat us literally a yard away from the the entrance\/exit with no barriers between the oncoming traffic. We requested another table and they were kind enough to oblige us.

However, getting to the food - there were long lines for the ""seafood"" section - in which case only shrimp and crab legs were served. Just as we were approaching to serve ourselves - the trays were refilled with literally ROCK HARD FROZEN seafood - inedible, crusty with ice crystals. Even once you let it defrost - it was waterlogged, soggy, mushy and tasteless. 

There were two or three carving stations. One with an Indian-style (tandoori?) tri tip or a flatter-style steak where they'd carve you a single small strip and expect you to go on your merry way. The prime rib was cooked beyond well-done. The asian dishes were sub-par as well (wonton soup - the won tons were doughy, undercooked, and the kind with the super thick wrappers that you know no real establishment that caters to the Chinese would serve)

THE GOOD:

My highlight of the night was taking the tikka masala sauce (and passing on the dry sinewy chicken that soaking in it) and mixing it into bowls of basmati rice... mmm so good!!!! This literally saved my meal and stopped me from good-flavor-starvation. But definitely not what I should've paid for. The flank steak was wonderful with the garlicy\/oniony topping.

About the food, they have several stations for international food, salads, desserts, etc. They had big sea food option with crab legs, Louisiana boil, sushi, ceviche etc.

Some of the stations were not open until dinner time, I believe they open them for dinner around 3:40pm.

- Beautiful area with refreshing colors and a view of the pool
- A diverse selection of food:
    +The areas were roughly divided into JAPANESE, CHINESE, MEDITERRANEAN and ITALIAN. 
- Other features include a bread\/carving\/dessert\/vegetable\/seafood section. 
    + There were mussels, shrimp, crab-legs and clams available 
    + I reconmand the SALMON STEAK, which is piece of salmon cooked through open fire, leaving it with a pink center
    + Vegetable section had beautifully vegetable appetizers and also some classic salads like goat cheese with pumpkin and candied pecans 
    + Carving section was not labeled very clearly, making the ordering process rather difficult.",0,0,0

I personally really enjoyed my experience here. The food was fresh and hot. They dont put out large portions. So its being constantly changed. Although I only had 3 crab legs the chef didn't give me the eye when I asked could he steam them please LOL

It wasnt a lot of variety, but enough of everything. Ur not over or underwhelmed by the selections. My friend thought the dessert plates were the coolest thing ever. And the desserts themselves were really good. And u can tell they put a lot of tlc into these mini desserts they were all good. 

They weren't that good about refilling drinks or removing used plates, but everything I ate was good. So I wont really complain.",3,3,2

Compared to other buffets in Vegas, this one for lunch was good. Yeah, and so most of them also strive to keep the guys on ""Deadliest Catch"" going for another season by serving the king crab legs, sliced in half, with drawn butter and lemon. Aria's were sweet and tasty!

The boiled prawns, on the other hand, were watery and devoid of flavor. The shrimp cocktails were awesome while the scallop and mussel ones were kinda rubbery. 

Loved the ham but the roast beef was one of the TOUGHEST and least flavored pieces of meat I've ever tasted. Was I at Arby's?! They also had no visible condiments available like mustard, horseradish, au jus, etc

Pros: 
Unlimited wine (I had some 8 plus glasses! cheap but yummy, and unlimited, so who cares??), super friendly service (everyone was so sweet) and delicious food. Also, as a vegetarian, I had no trouble finding anything to eat! I even feel like I got my money's worth (35 something pp for dinner). 

Cons: 
While there were veggie options, I had to ask about a bunch of things (like soup) to find out if there was any broth or anything in it. And no one knew! Not only that, they didn't really offer to find out. I just skipped them all, but it was a little strange that they didn't know! Also, dessert was a little lame. Granted, we didn't get to dessert until they were almost closing the buffet, but there was only one kind of ice cream out (butterfinger...bleh!) and none of the plates we tried tasted worth the calories. The cobbler was good, but sort of the tail ends. 

All in all, I loved it, but it would have been nice if they had more than two options for wine selections (i.e. substitute beer\/champagne).

I can't wait for the Ivy League players to get into the mix.

Anyway, back to food: as with many buffets, you have to know what to select and what to avoid. Unfortunately some of the most appealing-on-paper choices are also the worst here: the crab legs, the Asian station, and the tandoori oven cooked naan bread should be avoided at all costs. What I personally liked the most were some of least popular options: the grilled vegetables, the quinoa and tabouli salads. The prime rib and steamed clams in a tomato base were also good.

My wife got the surf & turf which was cold lobster paired with a quality rib eye in a bernaise sauce. However, the majority of things we tried here were just not up to snuff. The service was very friendly & efficient, and we never had to wait long for anything.

I decided to use up some of my resort credit on this place and the only positive thing that I can say is that I was definitely not hungry after.

First of all, I am a huge crab fan. I can sit for hours eating crab. However, Aria, much like other buffet places on the strip, have found a way to totally ruin the crab experience for me. How? They cut the crab legs in half! Now some of you are probably thinking, ""this makes it easier to eat"". For a crab eating veteran, all this does is to frustrate me. Over the years, I have honed my skillz at cracking, pulling out the 'crab tendons' and then freeing huge chunks of crab that provide a great melt in your mouth feeling experience. When the crab is cut in half, the tendon is still in there and you have to scrape it off. The result is shredded crab. In addition, since they were sliced in this fashion, the meat tends to dry out....but you didn't start reading this review about my pet peeves of buffet crab, you want to know about the Aria Buffet.

The buffet is not as pretty looking as some of the other high end buffets on the strip. Someone else had mentioned cafeteria feeling, and they are right. The intent was supposed to be a high end feel, but it ended up feeling sterile, like hospital sterile.

The food was a mixed bag of foods from all over the world. Asian, Mexican, Indian (they have a tandoor oven), American.....along with some cut cheeses and meats. All the food was executed poorly. The brisket was shoe leather tough. I come from brisket country and I know that the brisket presented there was several hours undercooked. The prime rib was tender, but not very flavorful. I also would have preferred it to be more on the rare side. You already know my stance on the crab legs. The tandori chicken was forgettable (bad thing for Indian food). The desserts were pretty poor too (I will give them a pass on the ice cream\/gelato\/sorbet)

The whole experience made me think about the buffets on cruise ships. Cruise ship buffets can be hit or miss, but there is always something tasty to eat. I once read that the food budget for one of the mass market cruise lines is around $7 per person per day (pastries, breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Considering I just forked over $35 for this meal, I was even more depressed (I know it was resort credit, but I could have eaten at another venue for that credit).

Don't get me started on the service. All I can say is that I felt like I was an annoyance to the server. Cmon people, smiles are free and they go a long way!

Not the worst strip buffet (that goes to the Riviera), but not too far off.

You can't be shy here.  There was a mountain of crab legs, but I did my best to pry out my own hill, and get to work with the drawn butter, and jumbo shrimp.  Good thing, because this was seriously the best part of the meal.  There was a spinach salad to accompany the crab, which I followed with a good chicken curry and garlic naan.  My carnivorous boyfriend did serious damage with a slab of prime rib, and had creamed spinach as a side dish.  Pizzas, mexican food, and Chinese food were also features, which could be good for kids.
I did enjoy the miniature salads in shot glasses, tomato and mozerella, and greens.  They were a great variation on the usual.  The tiny deserts were also appreciated, since we could try several, and enjoyed the creme brulee.  Cookies rounded off the meal.
The ambience needs tuning.  I appreciate mid-century modern, and while it is sophisticated modern minimalism in the shopping, and casino areas of Aria, it does take on a done to death cafeteria patina in the buffet.

The types of food they offered were: Diner- American far, Salad, Seafood, Mediterranean, Italian, Asian,  a carving station and dessert. Honestly not one dish stood out. The prime rib was dry and tough, the beef rib was pretty much pure fat, the asian food was just sad.

Just tell her ""you love Tap out shirts"" and slip her a $10 tip in the palm of your hand and you don't have to waiting in line any more.

We had kind of a terrible experience because we were short on time and stupidly chose to eat there despite that, so by the time we paid and were seated, we had 30 minutes before our Cirque du Soleil show. I mean, yeah we're idiots. 
However, the quality of food was overall really excellent (and not in a ""for a buffet"" sort of way - it was just really fresh). I sampled food from the Asian section (rivaled Chinese restaurant quality except for the fried rice), almost all of the seafood (wow - so much good seafood, prepared well, and super fresh, unlike other buffets I've eaten at), a little Indian food (the Dal Lentils were as good as my favorite Indian restaurant at home, but the basmati rice and Chicken Curry were only average), and just a bit of the salad bar (I grabbed one wedge salad). 
I know, I know, you're wondering how I managed to try so much in so short a period of time, but when I've spent $90 on a meal for my husband and me, I want it to count. 
The desserts were really good and plentiful - I tried the key lime pie, which was really good, and stole three macarons (WE HAD TO GO I'M SORRY I'LL NEVER DO IT AGAIN). I ate them the following day, and they were pretty good, albeit a little stale. 
My only complaint was the extreme lack of service. Our server came by once, maybe twice right before we left, so we were thirsty most of the 30 mins we were there. Because we were there pretty early, it wasn't particularly busy, so I was quite dismayed that we were basically ignored.

I waited far too long for them to ring me up because of computer issues -- shutting down, rebooting. I feel like there has to be a more efficient way. Then, no one seemed interested in seating me. Two women were chatting in a very intense -- and loud -- conversation while two other workers were trying to get their attention. It was awkward and definitely unprofessional on their part.

The buffet has such variety that it's overwhelming. How about I have some Latin with a side of Chinese and Mediterranean, then feast some more on Italian. I guess I liked the variety, but nothing really stood out. 

A few highlights were the guacamole: chunky avocado and tomatoes with some kick. I was expecting it to taste store bought, but it's definitely made from scratch. The tabbouleh was also very good, and I was surprised they even had Korean kimbap rolls.

The desserts were the best part. I indulged in the coffee ice cream (scooped by someone via a giant ice cream wheel), cheesecake and red velvet whoopie pie. It was far too much but all really good. I liked that all of their offerings were mini-sized rather than a full-sized cooke or dessert shot.

There are ""international"" stations to choose from for different dining options. I tried their pepperoni and veggie pizzas, which were very bland. I also wanted to try the Middle Eastern\/Mediterranean food, as I am Chaldean, but was sadly disappointed. The hummus was too ""rough"" and the tabbouleh was more brown than green. I tried a curry chicken dish which was pretty good, but ran out quickly and was never put out again in the time I was there. I had the same experience with the mac and cheese...which was delicious.

The flow pattern was odd, which made it confusing for everyone walking around. There was no order, just people aimlessly walking up to stations and in your way the entire time.

There is a long line at all times, but the wait isn't worth what you're getting. Our ""waitress"" Danielle brought us water and coke then disappeared for about 20 minutes.

While I don't think the food is fantastic there are a few things about it that keep me coming back.  The first thing I really appreciate is the fresh fruit on the Salad Bar.  I also love their Crab Legs.  They use King Crab instead of tiny Snow Crab like many other Buffets these days.  I also like the fact that their Crab Legs are served warm with drawn Butter instead of Cold with Cocktail Sauce!  If I am going to a Buffet the main thing I like to eat are Crab Legs and Shrimp.  The Prime Rib was fine but not great.  The other thing I love about the Aria Buffet is the desserts!  I guess Jean Philippe make their desserts and they are fantastic!!!  I love French Macarons!!!

The prices are the norm for a Las Vegas buffet but the food was reminiscent of something you'd find in Hometown. I found that the problem was they tried to cover too much ground. There was mexican, asian, seafood, pizza, etc but only a small tiny section of each. 

Mexican: I think I saw 4 things in their section. Enchiladas and Mexican rice were what I remembered. 

Asian: Decently sized but incredibly random. They had a platter of kimchi with chilled tofu\/cucumber salad on one side and purposely cold chicken noodles on the other.

A few steps down from the asian section were cut up chunks of cheese and deli meat placed on a carving board. 

Pizza: I never bother with buffet pizza but my boyfriend said it was really bad. 

Seafood: Cocktail Shrimp and Crab Legs period. 

Dessert: I picked up a cookie labeled chocolate chip only to find that it had nuts in it. Disappointed look for me but imagine if someone with a nut allergy had picked that one up. But even besides that, the cookies were pretty gross. I'd have to say i've tasted better from the bakeries at Ralph's or Safeway.

The desserts were very, very good with unique designs. You almost have to see them, but they are all wonderful bite size desserts. These unique desserts included the Aria take on carrot cake, strawberry shortcake, and even the Oreo Cakester!!!

With good reason, I'm not usually much of a fan of Vegas buffets.  However, it was lunchtime, the gf and I were hungry, we had a $100 resort credit to use, and the ARIA is an upscale casino-resort.  So we figured the Buffet at ARIA would be a safe bet.  Unlike most other casinos, the Buffet at ARIA is not located just off or even near the casino floor.  Instead, it's on the second floor\/Promenade level with several of the casino's fine dining restaurants.  The dining room is smaller than other buffets, yet open, well-lit by natural light coming in from floor to ceiling windows, airy, but with a weird, almost IKEA design aesthetic.  I could be very wrong about that last comment, but it was what came to mind when I entered the restaurant.  

The Buffet at ARIA offered culinary representation from many of the more popular international cuisines. The buffet's major draw seemed to be the Snow Crab legs as evidenced by the crowd of diners that were picking over the crab leg offerings like vultures over a rotting carcass.  Sadly, the crab legs were spindly, with little meat, and mealy for what little meat was present.  The selection of sushi rolls also failed to inspire much faith in the kitchen as the rice lacked moisture and the fillings were largely flavorless, relying on wasabi and soy sauce to provide the entire flavor profile.  Despite these and several other misses, all was not lost on the buffet.  The Indian chicken curry was actually one of the best tasting chicken curries that I've ever had.  It seemed to possess with all of the hoped for Indian spice and didn't taste ""dumbed down"" for Western palates.  The Chili Verde was a successful offering as the chunks of pork were nicely tender and bathing in a flavorful roasted green chili and tomatillo stew.  The lunch buffet with tax for two was $53.  Unfortunately, the food wasn't quite up to the price tag.  Fortunately, even though the food was largely lackluster, service was spot on.  Our water glasses were filled with frequency and dirty plates never lingered on our table for more than a minute or two.  

In the end, I only give the Buffet at ARIA 2 stars for food and value received, but added 1 star for the solid service.  Next time, I'll just stick to the Bellagio buffet or skip buffets altogether.",2,1,0

We used a 2 for 1 comp here, so this made the whole experience a bit easier all around. Knowing we did not spend $35 each helped us not feel cheated. We did purchase the $12.99 all you can drink sangria, wine, and beer. I stayed with the weak Sangria as I did not want to get drunk, I wanted to enjoy the food. 

I should have opted for drunk as the food was not good . There were stews (Chinese), stews (Indian) and more stews (fish, shellfish); boring, ugly and lazy for a buffet. Why have a tandoor if you are not going to cook nan to order? The nan was cold, and crisp and no one was there, at any time, to cook some up fresh. (And it appeared and tasted like the tandoori chicken was NOT cooked in the tandoor...perhaps baked?!) Sushi was stale and sloppy looking. Clams gritty. Cold prawn pasty and muddy tasting. Crab...well it was so small it was not worth the effort. Most certainly the cheapest they could find. Prime rib: flavorless (but at least there was both cream and grated horseradish). Sure there were lots of roasted meats offered on the carving stations so for some, this is a big plus, I am sure. 

Other than the flirty gentleman serving ice cream everyone there seemed angry and short. No one smiled, no one was pleasant. Our waitress scored a big tip because she at least kept the sangria coming, but even she seemed ready to go home (we got there at 8:15pm for a buffet that closes at 10pm). We tried to leave with a glass of sangria, and the woman at the front almost jumped down our throats and told us we needed to drink it there. ( I have half a mind to say ""Fine, but you know what, we were told at 9:50 it was the last we could get as the bar was closing yet the ""rules"" of the unlimited says two hours. So I will sit here, and BTW, I have another 25 minutes I could be drinking."" Mind you. we were being rushed out of the place because they were closing. yet this abrupt woman was telling us to sit and drink it. I felt sorry for those customers who were rushing to get food and did not seem happy about the closing of the buffet before being able to enjoy it. If you want everyone out at 10...then don't close at 10!!!) 

Back to the sangria. We pounded it and then promptly went back to our hotel which was NOT the Aria. If I cannot take a glass of sangria I paid for,(and was being rush, in my seat, to finish before 10pm) to the casino floor to gamble, then I leave.  Bad move Aria, you lost my evening gambling money.

When I booked our room at the Aria, I let the saleslady talk me into upgrading the room with a free breakfast buffet for the length of our stay. After all, it's the Aria -- a brand new hotel with top-notch ratings for service and quality. Plus, The Buffet at Aria is #5 on the Top 10 Vegas Buffet ratings at LasVegasDirect.com. So I came here with high hopes. 

It started bad right away. They have 2 cashier's stations for this place, and one of them is often clogged with ""VIPs"" with line-passes, so the line gets long and goes slow. Once you pay, you're held up until they get several tables to seat, and the maitre'd dispatches you with a hostess to drop you at your various tables like a UPS driver on a tight schedule. 

The buffet itself is constructed with a wall limiting access to it to a handful of entry\/exit points, and also serves to constrict traffic so that you are constantly in the way of or impeded by someone else. The overall sensation is of a herd of cattle being shunted down a chute to the feeding pens or holding floor. 

The bakery section is partitioned by glass that goes all the way to the ceiling, so when you try to talk to the buffet worker about what sort of bread or bagel you'd like toasted, it's like talking to a prisoner in ""Midnight Express."" You can barely hear each other though the glass, and leads to fun miscommunications (e.g.: ""May I have an onion bagel please?"" ""You want an Everything bagel?"" ""Uh, no, ONION please!"" ""Ok, white toast, coming up!"" ""Okay, fine, give it to me."") 

For those lucky enough to get seated near the windows, as another Yelper wrote, you will get sunlight and verdant views of the pool. The rest of you will get exiled to the low-roofed oppressive dungeon, with test-tube lights dangling from the ceiling like Superman's Fortress of Solitude. 

The food was uninspired but serviceable. The waitress, when she showed up, was friendly and efficient.

Now this review was during Saturday Brunch on Valentine's Day\/President's Day weekend. The regular brunch price is $29.99 per person but they decided to increase the price to $35.99 due to the holiday weekend. This was sneaky on their part to raise prices just for the weekend, but I realized $5 wasn't a big deal in Vegas (especially when you have a $50 room credit). It's also convenient for those staying at the ARIA. The line was nonexistent at 9:30a but grew after we left. Still, the line was not ridiculously long.

The Buffet is modern as you would expect walking into the ARIA. There are windows all around so it's quite bright. The d√©cor & furniture also help make the entire restaurant bright. The waiter service was just okay. My orange juice order was forgotten but plates were removed at a reasonable amount of time. I do love that they give you a large pitcher of coffee instead of having to flag the waiter down for a refill.

Overall, they have a good selection of foods. You can find Chinese, Indian, Korean, American, Mexican, Italian, French, and even Filipino food here. Their Asian foods were probably my favorite as they had Filipino longanisa (sausage) and their kimchi fried rice was delicious! They also have a legit tandoori oven to bake the naan. I really appreciate the gluten free options but I did find those dishes to be a bit bland. Most will appreciate that their snow crab legs are already cut in half. Although this saves the mess and time, I definitely feel more satisfied cracking open a crab leg myself. I also think that this dries out the crab meat. Speaking of dry, I found that a lot of their dishes were a bit dry possibly due to overcooking. Their desserts are quite good. I especially loved their revolving gelato machine.

I've read online how aria has one of the best buffets in vegas.  Sadly after attending I learned that is not the case. 

The wait to eat on new years eve was not terrible. Maybe 30-45 min.
We went around brunch time and the service was better than many people gave them credit for.

The food selection seemed very limited compared to the wynn and bellagio.  But that wasn't even what I was most disappointed with,  the food quality lacked majorly in flavor.  I think the only meat worth eating there was their kilbasa sausage. Pork was over cooked and skin was hard to even cut with their huge bulky dull knife, tri tip was very over done, and their chorizo sausage had no spice.

This is our first try at Aria so we don't know what to expect.  We had to wait in line for 75 minutes and the restaurant was only 3\/4 full with some sections closed off at 3:30 pm.  I noticed that our waitress had to cover 2 big sections and she's not even fit physically (250 lbs +).  I'm nothing against overweight waitresses but she moved really slow and didn't even notice that our glasses were empty for half an hour or so.  Moving on to the food, the only thing worth eating is their brisket and rack of lamb.  Their prime rib is too dry and the king crab is nothing special.  I don't care about the Indian and Mexican food because they're so cheap to eat elsewhere.  This is probably the worst $33 we've spent on any buffet.  If you're thinking about trying this buffet, please don't waste your money.  Just go to Wynn buffet for LUNCH and you'll be glad you listen to me.  Finally, we went to Wynn for lunch the next day and their lunch was way bigger than Aria dinner buffet at only $25.   Wynn had more cheeses than just 3 cheap selection of cheeses at Aria.  Wynn had parmegiano reggiano cheeses (expensive), more gourmet salad selections, more italian station, better sushi and way better dessert and gelato.  Even our kids didn't like Aria gelatos.  Their selection is poor and taste awkward.  If you go to Wynn, don't forget to try their bread pudding with anglaise sauce next to it...it's the best I've ever had.  Their gelato taste like real gelato and not some cheap ice cream.  I'm glad we came back to Wynn and after so many years trying Wynn, it never disappoint us.

Okay, let's be serious here, Aria: you can't slap the label ""GELATO"" on tubs of generic ice cream. Don't you dare put nuts in apple pie, either! BLASPHEMY!

I visited the Aria buffet this monday (march 21st) and I was so excited because I love the hotel and had the best service all 3 days that I stayed there! I had never been to a buffet in Las Vegas but made sure to make a point to visit one this time around. I really wish I would've gone to the buffet at the Wynn beause the reviews for it are stellar!

My girlfriends and I arrived at the buffet around 130pm for lunch the price was great about $23 and the cashier was friendly. There were maybe four people ahead of us so there was no wait and there were tons of open tables. After paying they had us wait there at the register for the Hotess to come and take us to our table. After about 10-15minutes of waiting there were about 10-15 people lined up behind us all paid and waiting on the Hostess. By this time we are asking the cashier 'what's the hold up?"" and ""why is it taking so long to be seated?"" The sweet lady (shikieko) who took our proof of payment was getting flustered because we weren't the only customers questioning the wait. Another man in line offered to go and find the Host for her because she expressed that she couldn't leave her post. After a few minutes more of complaining from all the customers waiting Shikieko ran off to find the Host who were no where in site. They came strolling out in a pair (one was named Kirly, she was especially RUDE) without any sense of urgency and still chatting to one another as they approached us. At this point a friend of mine was was pissed and requested to speak to the manager. The manager took a minute to come out as well so when she came we were all already at the buffet rushing to get food because we were on our way to the airport. Once we got to our table the manager (Brittany) was standing there. She started by saying ""Did you all want to speak with a manager?"" We replied ""yes we did we are not satisfied with the service we recieved at the front counter! The Host are not friendly and have no sense of customer service or urgency we have been waiting for nearly 15 minutes to be seated and there are several tables available"" Before I could finish she replied ""oh well they came as soon as they could they were busy clearing tables, but ill talk to them"". Before I blurted out BITCH what fuck is your problem you owe us a damn apology!!!!! My gf stepped in and said ""Tthey were no where in site and a 15 minute wait is just unacceptable when there are several free tables. It's not busy in here and they could have thanked us for waiting, apologized or something!"" Brittany replied ""oh ok well ya I will talk to them."" We also brought in a cake with us. We had no intentions of cutting the cake there our plan was to grab a cocktail at a lounge in the Aria and cut the cake there. Brittany made sure as she walked away from the table to say ""oh by the way you all can't cut that cake in here!"" We were extremely pissed at this point.

So we conitued to eat, but the food was nothing spectactular. They had a a few dishes from several different cuisines (Italian, Mexican, Japanese, American, seafood, roast beef, and a pasta bar) Im a vegetarian so I wasn't impressed. I had a a few avacado rolls, vegetable rolls, mixed green salad, corn on the cob, french toast and tofu salad. Believe it or not the best thing was the damn french toast everything else I tried was so mediocre. So after we ate we decided to cut our cake and offer our sweet server Shikieko some she decilened; but wecontinued to nibble and left the rest there in hopes the manger would see!!!!

DON'T GO HERE THE MANAGER IS BEYOND RUDE SO WHAT CAN EXPECT FROM HER RAGEDY ASS EMPLOYEES!!!!!!

Really sad my stay at the Aria ended this way!",5,3,1

So when my sister kept raving about this place and how good it was, I decided to give this buffet a try. Thankfully, there was NO line. The cool part was that for every two people, we get to share a maine lobster. The lobster was GOOD! However, the KING CRAB LEGS, were NOT. It was sooooo salty!! I even dipped it in butter to take away the saltiness, but I gave up after ONE plate. C'mon...I usually plates and plates of this! 

Not only was the king crab legs salty, their weren't many choices for other types of food. I love all types of mash potatoes, and you can't really go wrong with that. However, their mash potatoes were still uncooked and also LOOKED uncooked. UGH. The only good thing about this place were their desserts.

For the same price as the Bellagio buffet, this place is very subpar. Yes, there's a fair variety of seafood, which is probably the only good thing about this place. However, the food here lacks quality. The soup tasted bland, fish tasted funky and the cuisine selections are very limited. The prime rib and lamb chop here is so overdone (old), it looks so brown on the inside. The turkey cut was also dry. Foods are portioned on small bowls like it is being rationed. I definitely would rather spend the $45 at Bellagio or Wynn for much better taste, QUALITY, service and selection.

Friend who walked in on me as I was voiding my stomach contents into the guest room toilet: ""Ew.""

Not a doctor, so I can't say if it was because I had a spoiled sushi roll, or if some piece of prime rib I ate had gone bad...or if in true Vegas fashion, I just really did overeat and my stomach just could not hang.

To be fair, it wasn't garbage whatsoever.  Descent upscale buffet with better than average ingredients.  The selection didn't seem as varied or plenty as Bellagio's or The Mirage's buffet though.

The dining area is well decorated...nice and contemporary --- in line with the rest of the Resort's styling.  One really weird thing I have to mention! While eating at a banquette seat, you WILL feel a rattling vibration as you dine which I'm guessing comes from the CityCenter tram.  Terrible design flaw.  We could actually see the surface of the wine in our glasses shiver like the way in the first Jurassic Park film when the terrified kids helplessly watched the water in the plastic cup moving when the T-Rex was stomping towards them.

Other notes: Aria comp'd half our bill (thanks Players Club) and we went when they were serving unlimited red wine and lobster tail (only available Friday & Saturday for Dinner).  Best thing there aside from the lobster tail is the lobster stuffed ravioli. Mmmm.",2,4,1

So many buffets to choose from, and at a comparable price ($40) to Como's (Wicked Spoon) and Encore's -- this one pales in comparison. 

- The line to get in seems to always be really long, except at random hours that aren't usually when people eat
- We went after reading all about the crab, but this is where we were most disappointed (and entire Yelp Star off) for the crab (snow, king):  they served it cut in half (length wise) which means you're getting little shards of meat, not those heavenly huge chunks you can get when you crack it yourself. They also serve it cold (read: it's completely frozen) and steamed (limp, soggy, gross)
- Huge selection, so if your goal is to stuff your face you're all set and you'll be in heaven -- but if your goal is to taste really well-done versions of international foods-- then this is not your place

I also appreciated  how Chef Kreg asked how we were enjoying our meal. The little things like that help enhance your experience and make you feel valued.

The food was absolutely phenomenal! I almost wish I didn't get full so fast so I could try more. My favorite part was the endless amount of fresh seafood. They never ran low on anything and every item I picked seemed like it was in the ocean the day before. I also would like to rave about the lamb chops. I am picky with lamb, so it says a lot if they got my approval with that one. It was cooked to perfection along with their other meat choices. I had the prime rib as well and wish I had saved room for the cowboy steak. I didn't have it, but my friend said it was her favorite.

My favorite dessert was the pistachio gelato. I have this odd obsession with pistachios so I when I saw it in the gelato form, I had to indulge. It was the perfect way to end my perfect dinner.

The best way I could describe this experience is it truly is fine dining cuisine in a buffet setting. Kudos to Chef Kreg, our server Kelly, and the rest of the staff. Keep up the good work, guys! I'll be back soon!",0,0,1

Slow... slow... slow.... S...L...O...W.... Oh, and did I mention slow?  

Full:

We decided to try this buffet since so many people hyped it up to be something it really wasn't. But we stayed at Aria so we though might as well right? We came on a Saturday night and got the two maine lobsters (which weren't great and big at all, more like prawns) and unlimited wine. We paid around $37 per person and I don't feel like it was anything special. The waitress was nice, but very slow even though the place wasn't even packed. It was amazing how slow they were and it was pretty stupid since another waitress passing by could not serve us, she had to hunt down our waitress to refer our request to her. Even for just a simple refill. Talk about inefficient and slow! 

The food wasn't really unique or tasty, nothing really stood out. I would go to the Belagio buffet for better stuff and seafood. There were however a good selection of meats (prime rib, ny steak, lamb, etc). The thing that turned me off was the food manager who was throwing an absolute piss fit. Yea, sure the table was messy, but he was yelling at the chef right in front of the customers in line. Talk about total humiliation and making yourself look like a jerk. When you're pissed it shows and people tend to avoid pissed off people or think differently about them.

The dinner experience at The Buffett at Aria left me wanting more. It costs more $ to eat here than it does at the Bellagio, but the Aria offers a smaller collection of food and dessert. I enjoyed the King Crab legs and the Prime Rib here but the sushi, chinese and dessert sections were lackluster. I saw a whole aisle of Chinese dim sum steamers but was disappointed to find that they were all filled with buns and some yucky potstickers, no other dim sum. The sushi rice was also really dry too. There were not a lot of patrons eating at 3pm on Sunday, but the servers were very slow in taking away used plates and refilling drinks. 

 I like that the buffet space is very spacious and the interior looks beautiful. Unfortunately, I rather go back to the Buffet at Bellagio or Bacchanal Buffet because they offer much more in terms of selection at a comparable cost.

I came to Vegas and we were starving and went to the buffet since we were staying at the Aria. Dinner on a Saturday night was $35 per person. Ouch!

They did have lobster which I'm told isn't served at most buffets and since lobster goes for about 10 bucks per tail, I could see why people were loading up on lobster getting 3-4 a plate. 

For a buffet, they do have a decent selection of meats (prime rib, steak, roasted pig, chicken, etcetera. No ham). They had pork chops as well but I can't remember how it was made. 

They do have a good selection of seafood, pastas, and desserts and the Aria buffet seems to strive for quality over quantity but I think most of buffets have similar items. The items at Aria are slightly better but I never go to buffets for desserts and a creme brulee is a creme brulee no matter where you go. The desserts look pretty and come in their own plates and they do have a decent selection.

The oddest thing about the restaurant is that it actually shakes. We all thought it was because we all had a long flight and had been starving all day. But it seems either their sound system isn't setup right or they forgot to install some insulation when they built the place. It actually felt like eating during a mild earthquake (around 3.0 on the Richter scale for us Californians :) ).

Service was slow. Our server was nice but we could tell she was really busy despite the fact we arrived really early for dinner (4pm) and the place was not packed. It took awhile before she could back to our table for refills and clear our plates. My opinion on that is that they need to hire more servers because they can't handle the load at the moment.

It has a lot of the same food that the Bacchanal buffet has at Caesars but it's not as pricey. Caesar's has the fresh juice and the crepes made to order but if you don't care about those items I think the food is similar.  If you are a local there is a locals discount during the week which is about $30.00 a person . The good news about going during the week is they still serve crab legs during dinner and it isn't as crowded as the weekend. 

I liked the fact that during dinner you not only get the crab legs but they can make you Pan Roast (seafood cooked in a red broth served with rice) to order. They only sprinkle a little rice in it but you can add more white rice it is near the Pho. Yes there is also Pho (Vietnamese soup) for those who love soup like I do especially in this chilly weather. The Pan Roast had a nice kick to it and it was super tasty but I think it could do without this pink and white seafood block they put in it though.  They also have a Cajun type of stew with corn ,sausage , shrimp that is pretty good too. Dinner and brunch both have creative salads to choose from.

I said ""it has no shrimp in it!""  So onto the next one...that must be a mistake of course. Har gow #2....what....?!!  I spit it out....less surreptitiously. This time I poked at it and tried to assess what was going on. It tasted like shrimp and seafood...but not completely like shrimp and it seemed mealy. Well these two must have been overcooked I surmised. Onto #3.....gag. What? This time I dissected this thing and the only thing I could think is that they have mashed up shrimp with fish cake or fish ball? #4 was the same...I couldn't even go to #5. By the way, the har gow was not disappearing off the buffett like last time. Aria, you definitely saved money by preparing it this way...please don't call it har gow!

The seafood saves this buffet though. We chowed down on snow crab legs which were surprisingly tasty for as small as they were...not too salty and seemingly fresh. We also feasted on well prepared shrimp, clams and mussels. They even have crawfish or ""mudbugs"" like they say down in Louisiana. We splurged on the all you can drink package for 13 bucks....quite a deal but it does take a little while to get your beverages.   While I still think they have one of the better seafood selections, not sure I would return knowing that they cheapened the har gow.",1,0,1

If you want a fine dining experience - go to Scarpetta or Guy Savoy. If you want an amazing buffet - it's at Aria. 

I first went to the Aria buffet in October 2012 and by the time of my next visit in October 2013, it had been revamped. I liked it originally, but the re-do makes the experience even better. My friend and I visited for lunch, and the price was very reasonable - maybe $22? Complimentary beverages are served in classy stemless wine glasses and our cheerful server was all about making sure we stayed hydrated. 

Of all the things I ate, the only bite I wasn't crazy about was a lone potsticker. That means I found the following things delicious: chicken salad, ham, macaroni & cheese, mashed potatoes, sushi (albeit the rice was a tad dry), antipasti, mushroom bruschetta, French onion soup, corned beef hash, gazpacho, crab legs, mussels, pecan tart, chocolate cake, coconut macaroons...and probably more things I can't remember.",6,1,3

It is unfortunate that a property such as the Aria would fail to have a buffet that matched it's elegance and stature.

Expect to pay around 37 dollars for  Sunday night's special gourmet dinner (I'm assuming the price is the same for Friday and Saturday nights as well).  I found the selection to be rather limited ... for this price I expected much much more.  Prime rib was decent ... though it was immediately canceled out by the second-rate lamb sharing it's carving station with.  Crab legs were decent but certainly nothing to write home about ... the rest of the selection were pretty mediocre at best.  Certainly not enough fresh fish selection the likes you would expect at say the Bellagio.

The gourmet dinner also included wine which is a nice touch ... unfortunately the only red available is a Merlot (and as you guess ... I'm not really a huge fan of the Merlot ... but I'm  not holding that against them - it's the thought that counts).  The dinner also provides for ""one Maine lobster"" per person .... however, I was not told that this ""Maine lobster"" would be a teenage lobster at best.  In fact, I'm pretty certain that this lobster had just got done asking it's parents for it's first iPod Touch before being plucked from the ocean's floor and served at my table.  Had I known in advance I would have spared his life and came back for him a year later.

The buffet did have some delightful naan bread (Aria boasts the only tandoori oven available at a Vegas buffet) ... however the curry that accompanied it was a bit pedestrian.  The lone bright spot for me was the dessert - it was certainly the highlight of the entire meal.

I feel horrible writing such a scathing review for a meal that I didn't even pay for (it was comped by the hotel ... though later returned to the casino via the craps table).  However, for the price they are charging I feel that there are certainly much better options available.  Picking this buffet is like getting two face cards in black jack only for the dealer to beat you by having 21 - you expected to win ... but in the end ... reality kicks in.",1,1,0

I gave it a try because I earned the free buffet reward with the myVEGAS app.  It cost around $30 per person for lunch.  They have a big selection of food from different cultures, however, the quality is just not great.  Most of the food I can only give 70\/100.  Such as the sushi and sashimi were not refresh at all and not even in good presentation.  Nothing really attracted me except they have a nice salad bar.  Well salad is simple right, just different raw ingredients to be put together.  So I did a simple salad and added a piece of roasted chicken. My husband didn't even feel like eating most of the food.

I'll go down on an avalanche with this one and say that seafood and exotic food - mediteranean & indian - lovers, you will love this place. Baba Ghanoush, lamb curry, king crab legs, mussels, clams etc. are scattered along the recently renovated buffet area and you have the whole left portion of the aisle for dessert. This is where I come in.

Over the years, I've trained myself two disciplines at the buffet 1) eat a small portion of everything 2) get cookies and flan for appetizers, salad for first main course and the carbs for second main! I mean it's not all the time we go to a buffet so number 2 happens more often than I'd want it to. What I'm trying to say is, you do not want to miss out on dessert at the strip buffets, aria is no exception.

On top of getting fancy with the food names, aria offers a good round of high quality sweets for comparatively less than what you'd pay for it you got them individually outside. I wasn't too crazy about the salads though, and the fact that there was a lonely toaster by the bread area.  Mommy thought it was an artistic touch - take it from someone who loves being in the kitchen. Papa stuck to getting some crab legs in every round. I got cookies for appetizers, he got crabs. We're almost always this way. 

Thankfully, I'm bent on keeping my cookie cravings to 2013. Next trip here, I may actually try the salad. Mmm actually, let me give this place a 3.6, pretty much because I kept wishing they had more variety of sushi - maybe salmon, sweet egg etc. Next one to try is the Paris buffet but that's probably set for later this year.",4,1,2

I was just surprisingly excited to see how the Hotel was decorated. When my friends and I got to the Buffet line, at first I was bummed of how long the line was and that it might take forever to go through. But it went though pretty fast considering that there was 14 or 16 of us and they really accommodated us so we could seat together. 

My Friends and I were there for brunch and they had great selection. There were Crab legs, sushi, lamb\/ roast beef\/ and another choice of meat, egg Benedict's, Mexican breakfast burritos, pizza, and alot of other food choice to get. Also their dessert was really good choices, the only dessert that I thought that was just okay was the Oreo cream dessert. I thought the way that they made the oreo dessert could of been better but there were alot of other choices of dessert that I was able to eat. 

Now with the service was wonderful. The line to get though the paying and getting seated was really fast especially since there was 14 or 16 of us to be seated in the same area. The Cost of the type of food and choice was amazing. The totally that everyone paid was $30.30 per person; that included the tax and also tip ( you could get alcohol but it will cost a bit more). So I thought that was great, especially since we arrived there around 1ish and left around 3 pm. SO we were consuming food for roughly 2 hours and we got well over our moneys worth of food.

I would recommend this buffet to people that wants there money worth of good food.  YOu really can not pass up a buffet style food for $30.30 (inculding tax and tip), especially for the quality of the food.

Because I don't feel like paying full price, I've never come here on a Friday night or a weekend. I've read that they have lobster on the menu then? Not sure.
I always start with the prime rib, grab maybe some turkey, and get some soup.
Afterwards I go around for my second round and get crab legs with melted butter, take a look at their Latin foods, and Asian foods.
In the middle area they usually have something sort of fancy looking, so I get some of that.
The Pho noodles and soup isn't great, but if you add sauces you can alter the taste a bit.

The Aria Hotel in City Centre is very un Vegas. Think clean, cool lines and textures. The Buffet carries the theme. Due new on the strip no huge, stomach rumbling lines at dinner. Nope walk right in on weekday visit and weekend visit. If you are a supersize me kinda of diner well this will not be the place for you.  Here the buffett doesnot carry the huge selection of the Bellagio, not even close. But what it has here is well done and for the most part tasty. There is an Indian station that one night had tikka massala chicken and another fish jalfrazie and would you beleive a naan oven right in front. Roast Beef, Lamb, Turkey, Pork. A smattering of pastas. A fish or two.
Weekend as with hotel rooms and buffets means higher prices. Aria does it different in that they offer each person paying the Friday and Saturday ransom gets table service of a lobster tail plus a glass or your choice red or white.   The tail is not your New England crustacean but more like Naw 'leans crayfish.   Aria gets good marks for trying.

The deserts, though small in  variety compared to the massive sweets of say, the Bellagio's, is actually better tasting and visually more appealing.

I love Aria buffet and after eating here at least a good dozen times, I can honestly recommend it to everybody. Unlike a lot of the buffets, here, it has a feeling of airiness. It's bright, inviting, and has a view of the Aria pools (which may or may not be good news).  When I'm getting down and stuffing my mouth, I don't want to feel claustrophobic or think the ceilings are about to cave in.

Every time I go it's packed, which is a good sign because food is constantly being replaced and made. I love the crab legs and if I had my way, I would be there all day. 

The downside is that it's pricey for the amount of food available. Good thing MGM resorts always have those free buffet vouchers available!

Boy, I kind of regret it. I came here after walking eons on the strip just for the buffet and the line should've been the first indication that this place wasn't that great. For a Sunday afternoon, the line for brunch was short. So short that it made me feel silly for rushing to get to the buffet in case there was a long wait (like Bellagio, for instance.) I guess we should be thankful that the line was so short so we could promptly be seated, but the problem was, we want to get seated quickly for buffets that exceeded expectations. For a mediocre brunch buffet here, it didn't surprise us that the line was short. 

First, let me discuss the selection of food. Yes, there is a variety of cuisine available, from Asian to Italian to Mexican to anything. Breakfast food was also an option, like danishes, muffins, french toast, etc. But the problem was, the selection was small and the quality average! You can basically see everything they had to offer with one glance. The meat, steaks, etc were tough and dry and some foods were plain bad (chow foon - too salty). We were not impressed with the quality of options there. Everything just tasted okay-to-acceptable, with only a few that were exceptionally great (if you were to go, I suggest eating the cracked crab legs with the clarified butter, the seamen's stew, the sugar-free coconut cake & coconut gelato.) It's not what I would pay good money for - though to be fair, this is probably one of the cheapest brunch buffets around. You get what you pay for, I guess, but I didn't come here because of the cheaper price (~30 pp.) I wanted to be wowed, dazzled and impressed by an authentic Las Vegas Sin City type of buffet experience that would forever change and rival my meaning of good food. I read great recommendations for this place and thought this would be it and even condescendingly judged those who gave this place bad reviews as chumps. Well, guess I'm the chump now.

On the other hand, the service was spectacular. Our section's waitress did a fantastic job taking away plates when needed and being so considerate and attentive to our needs. She had some really cute hair clips in the front, which made her easily identifiable, not that we needed it since she was so attentive so we made sure to give extra tips. She made the experience a lot easier to swallow, but average food is average. Can't lie about that.

Mostly this is due to the high cost of eating there when I would rather spend that money on a single entree at a regular restaurant.  Last night I had the pleasure of attending the pre-opening of Aria with all meals and casino play comp'd.  We had the choice of either the cafe or the buffet.  Since there was a huge line to the cafe, we chose to head upstairs and see what was offered.

The buffet is very attractive physically with different levels to the seating area as you move through the room.  The serving area surrounds the room, starting with salad and seafood and moving through the typical, yet sophisticated buffet faire.  It ends with the dessert area which is less substantial than many buffets but did have some good treats.

The food ranges from crab legs and shrimp to veal bollanaise (at least on this particular night), from hummus to asian noodles.  Again, much of the same stuff I've found at the Palms buffet or Wynn's.  Compared to Wynn's buffet, the Aria does not compare in choice for dinner or selection in desserts.  The food was of high quality at Aria but not worth the $30 after taxes it will cost for a dinner here.

Perhaps after the grand opening the selections will change.  There are some issues with people lining up for the seafood when they may not realize you don't have to wait to move around the rest of the room; a bottleneck that almost ends up having people lining up near the entryway.

I would probably come here again only if the meal was comp'd.  If I were a guest at the Aria this would be a good choice for a buffet as there is nothing else within walking distance from the casino (perhaps Bellagio but I've never eaten there) that would be any better, but maybe the walk will build up an appetite that any food can resolve.",5,0,0

Since Aria was new and we were staying at this hotel, we opted to try out its buffet.  It turned out that the buffet was average and somewhat disappointing.  Given the buffet price is the same as the buffet at Wynn, Wynn buffet has better food quality.  We may or may not return to the Buffet at Aria for our next visit.

Service:  Friendly
The staff was efficient and friendly.  There was no line on a Saturday night, which was surprising since it was a new buffet - this was a good hint to the value of this buffet (overprice for the food quality).

Food:  Average
One of the food items that other buffets did not have was the whole lobster tail.  The lobster tail was quite big; however, it was also quite chewy.  All the beef items, kobe beef steak, prime ribs, baby back ribs were all too dry and well done.  The Indian fare (tandoori beef, garlic naan) was quite good.  The dessert was great.  We loved the pistachio biscotti.",1,0,0

The king crab legs tasted like salt licks and a large number of other dishes were too scary looking to try. The prime rib and desert section was Aria's only saving grace. The gelato was housed in a revolving freezer that sort of reminded my of a Ice Cream Pistol LOL.  Avoid eating here as this is no longer a good buffet.  There is an all you can drink option for beer and wine for $12.99.  I suppose if you drink enough the food might taste better LMAO

Seafood: King crab legs were a bit salty depending if you got them at the bottom of the bowl or at the top. I loved the way they had them prepared. They are split in half so you don't have to be picking at it. Makes it efficient. The quality of crab legs are pretty good. Yes, they may be slightly on the frozen side, but it also means you wont go home with a sick stomach.

Meats: Yum! Lamb galore and the prime rib was juicy too. There is also chicken enchiladas... the sauce is yummy, but then again, I like it mild.

I saved my stomach for dessert. I tried almost everything in the dessert isle (except for their mint cake)... the colour was a bit scary. It was well worth it. I hear their desserts are catered by Jean Philipe... don't quote me on it. They are so tasty... I particularly liked the cream puff... it has custard and fresh cream (not the cheap stuff) sandwiched in the centre. I went back for more...",2,0,1

 Everyone on staff was miserable. The only guy that was happy to serve me was the guy at the carving station,  African American gentlemen. Can't remember his name.

Waitress asked us what we wanted to drink.  Doesn't grab us silverware. I had to ask for it. She then says, ""Oh! It's suppose to be set already"".  She didn't refill our drinks.

The food was okay at best.  They had ""portuguese sausages"", I asked the carver is it Chorizo or Linguica? He said to me,  ""the first one"". Lol. It was not as spicy as I expected. It was okay, edible. The only thing I liked was pleased with was the mash potatoes had garlic in them.  I ate the mash & tried everything.  It was all cold & old sitting out.  The chicken pot stickers were awfully bland.

The desserts were pretty good but the Asian man serving gelato was a prick. He had something up his butt. He sees me waiting behind the girl he was serving.

WHAT I LOVE:
I love that this place is so bright!  It wakes me up from my groggy mornings in Vegas haha!  Also, they have some YUMMY select breakfast foods which I haven't seen anywhere else.  They serve breakfast burritos which are delicious!  And *drum roll please*, HASH BROWNS!  I love me some hash browns!  Not only that, but I indulged like crazy on the crab legs.  Mountains of crab legs on my plate, dipped with melted butter and lemon...yum!  My mouth is watering already.  Service here is also amazing.  Our waitress kept coming by with refills and was just on top of everything!

WHY ONLY 4 STARS:
Well, although Aria had endless crab legs for me to indulge on and some delicious breakfast items, I still felt that the variety of food offered here did not compare to say the Wynn or the Cosmopolitan.  We also came here thinking that our lunch buffet was going to be $20 from the yelp reviews, but it turned out to be around $34 each =(

They do have some small portions (ramaken size) pasta, pho, and other dishes.  I stayed away from the bread, potatoes, and filling Mexican food to focus on the seafood.  The weak spot was the Asian food - was only so so.

It was just alright... We came here on a Sunday around 11 AM. And while waiting in the regular line, patrons told us that if we are M life pearl card holders, we needn't wait in the regular line, we can join the ""express line"" instead. Which turned out to be a mistake. 

As soon as we switched the line, all we saw was the people standing in the regular line moving along and being seated. Meanwhile M life pearl or higher members just stood there browsing through our phones, or debating whether or not if we're gonna continue the wait. Just right before we were ready to leave, we were finally seated. 

To be fair, they do have better food quality than ""wicked spoon."" And for those looking for crab legs, unpeeled shrimps, or crawfish? This is the right spot! The dessert selections here were a bit underwhelming, and quite truthfully, generic. They served typical buffet style cakes and desserts, even the gelato were quite blend (other than the overpowering sweetness, of course.) And at $46 each person for brunch (tax, tips included,) I thought they can try a little harder.

I honestly cannot fathom why they were holding the M life members while letting regular line people in continuously, wouldn't it be fair to rotate? Overall, I'd say it's your typical Vegas style brunch buffet.",1,1,1

Ages 3 and below are free, every age above that pays the same price. Otherwise, I'm so happy that we payed the pretty penny to be able to eat here for dinner. The complementary lobster was amazing and all the adults had complementary merlot as well. 

I personally enjoyed the freshly made naan (Indian sort of ""tortilla""), the American side dishes including gluten-free baby carrots and roasted asparagus, and the Margarita pizza. Lastly, their dessert selection with their cakes aren't like most buffets I've been to - the presentation was gorgeous for each cake or pie. On top of that, the buffet in general had a wide selection of international foods which I really enjoyed. One thing though - fix up your sushi selection for us sushi lovers, please :) I only had one piece of a california roll and even that didn't even really suffice. I was a little disappointed but everything else made up for it!

Glad they had the crab legs, plump prime rib, and the mash potatoes, but that's about the best part.  There was congee and sushi, but didn't dare touch that.

Meat and seafood were super dry. I never knew you could make steamed crab leg jerky but they managed to here. Even the lamb curry was dry and its braised in liquid.

I was surprised when some trashed it so much, so I was glad when MGM Resorts announced they were closing the buffet and re-doing it.  Yesterday I had the chance to try it since the redo.

It's basically the same place with a few modest changes and perhaps the addition of a few stations.  First the good--the prime rib was cooked nicely with it being a nice red rare.  The vegetable korma in the Tandoori section was quite good.  The chicken tikka masala was OK, but it needed more spice.  The seafood gumbo was quite nice.  I wish I had noticed the basmati rice in the tandoori section first.  I would have put some rice in the bowl and then added the gumbo.  The cheese bar was very nice with some dried fruit with the cheese.  The desserts were outstanding!!

A few lesser dishes.  The bao sandwich was not good at all.  The lovely steamed roll had dried hard from sitting warming for however long it was there.  The pork in the bun was kind of bland making this a fail choice.  There were some different bread selections but not a wide range to choose from.  The chicken satay was merely OK.  The peanut sauce was way too runny and didn't have a lot of flavor.  When you're paying $36.74 for dinner buffet, the shrimp should be PEELED.  I didn't have any because this is an onerous task for me.

Now the desserts.  While there was nothing exotic or earth shaking, they had some very nice small desserts.  I'm a sucker for meringue cookies and they had a fruit flavored one.  It was delightful!  I also had two of their mini whoopie cookies--one a snowball (chocolate cake with coconut) and one made from red velvet.  The cream filling was very good.  The gelato selection is good and I had the Oreo gelato.  Nice and creamy.

This isn't a buffet to which I'd likely return.  For the price, there are better buffets on the Strip with some very good selections.  Also for the price, I think I'd pay a little more and eat at one of Aria's fine selection of restaurants!",9,1,8

But overall, little to complain about in service. 

The food selection is rather limited when compared to the bounty of the Bacchanal feast. However, no matter what you get, it's all very delicious. The food quality is probably on a higher standard than the one that we got on ill-advised trip to Caesar's Palace; we actually enjoyed even the salad. The standard fare was included, with brisket, prime rib, sausages, desserts, Chinese\/Latino\/French\/Japanese\/Mediterranean fare all included. However, I actually enjoyed everything that I ate here and I don't really have much to say in regards to things that you should avoid. I would say that this is a safe buffet - you can come and not be disappointed b\/c there is plenty to enjoy and you would like whatever you picked up.

(Of note to vegetarians and vegans or those on a low carb regime.).  Salad was a pathetic little station with small bowls like you'd see at Carl's Junior - in fact Carl's may have a bigger selection at their salad bar.  There's no way you could build a salad meal here.  If you want only a side salad, you're in business.

Grilled vegetables were way across the room on a small dish perhaps 4"" in length at best, next to some cured olives at the ""Mediterranean"" station.  Somewhat pathetic.

A strange orphan station with salsa and guacamole plus sour cream were standing alone on one side of a small kiosk (with sushi and soups) without any appropriate foods that they might actually accompany nearby.... Huh?

Eggs Benedict didn't just have runny yolk, the whites were uncooked. Yuck!

The cocktail shrimp was soggy, the hashbrown was really really dry and flavorless, and so was this bread that had sun-dried tomatoes on it.

The food that was good were the egg benedict, prime rib, and crab legs, and the desserts. So you should just ignore everything and just stick with those three and have dessert. 

The desserts that I had were chocolate cake, flan, and creme puff. They were all really good, but I think I like the chocolate cake the best. My boyfriend liked the flan and he also got himself oreo ice cream with m&ms, which was really good too.

I wouldn't mind coming back here, because some of the food here are really good, you just need to know what to stay away from....",1,1,1

I went to the omelette station and ordered a vegetable omelette with fresh eggs. I noticed Leopold put egg beaters in there, so I told him that I wanted fresh eggs. He gave me the stink eye and said ""it's the same"". I said I didn't want egg beaters, so he dumped it out and put some vegetables in the pan again, but this time he didn't let it cook, resulting in a very runny omelette. Also the eggs were undercooked, salmonella anyone?

I think we had a server, but it could have been the abominable snowman cause I never saw them. We didn't have spoons to stir our coffee with, so made do with the handles of our knives.

I was really not impressed with the selection of food, the ones that I did try were disgusting. I thought, I'll just have a bagel. It was a brick!

My wife and I had only taken a few bites and decided to leave and go somewhere else to eat.

The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is because I complained to the manager on the way out and she was genuinely concerned about the experience and refunded our money.",0,2,0

they have a decent selection of food. your typical meats, veggies, and ethnic dishes. i saw that they had prepared a bowl or rice with a piece of kimchi and galbi. haha i thought it was funny since koreans typically dont eat it like that. the king crab was ok for a buffet. there were a lot of small prepared dishes you could take instead of a spoon and take as much as you want. i like that better since dirty grubby hands arent all over the spoons. there was even a tandoori oven. i was impressed but didnt feel like eating indian. 

their desserts section was pretty nice. ice cream, gelato, and a less than happy desserts station guy to give me a small scoop of cookies and cream.

my parents pointed out that a lot of the employees seem to be ""hiding"" or not really manning their stations. i dont know if its due to the ""shelf"" or ""wall"" that pretty much separates you from them. i have to look through holes to see them or get their attention. but i did notice a lot of them on their phones. hey, candy crush is addicting...

the most impressive part of the buffet i found to be were the sliced cured meats. i forgot the names but one was similar to prosciutto, another was more fatty marbleized, salami, and some kind of bologna. i didnt care for the bologna but i ate a whole mess of the other slices.

i dont understand why people goto expensive buffets to eat pizza, pasta, and drink a whole mess of soda... at that point seems like you should just goto an $8.99 buffet (which gold coast has an excellent buffet for the price).

other than the king crab and cured meats, i wouldnt come back here to eat at the price even with my parents senior citizen discount. i also clenched my butt cheeks as i pulled out into las vegas blvd making sure i dont see any range rovers and maseratis. i hate driving down to the strip...",0,1,0

Unsuccessful because these guys were staying at Vdara, so they had the resort credit.  Fine, whatever, I'll give it a shot.

I can say...pretty good.  Not quite Wynn, but up there.  Before I get to the food, it's important to note how spacious and clean this place is.  There are those buffets that look so ghetto that you really can't feel comfortable pigging out.  This is not one of those buffets, so rest assured that's not a problem.

They space out the food by various kinds of cuisine: Chinese, seafood, meat section, sushi, etc.  Here's the important stuff: king crab legs, rack of lamb, prime rib.  As long as you have those big three, then I'm sold immediately.  Just grab a plate of king crab legs, grab some warm butter, and go to town!  They also have a BBQ beef and pork ribs too, which are a nice change-up from the big three.  

Aside from that, don't waste your time on sushi.  It's just standard fare and quite unappetizing if you ask me.  The dim sum here was pretty bleh, but the roasted duck leg and Peking duck was pretty damn awesome.  Raw oysters were also ftw.  And their truffle mac and cheese...this is probably the best thing in this place for real.  I typically stay away from carbs when I come to a buffet, but for truffle anything, I'll always make the exception.  My only gripe is that the shrimp wasn't already shelled, and that's why I can't give it a 5.  Come on, I don't have the time to waste on shucking the shrimp!

Barely made it to dessert, but their cheesecake is pretty good.  They have a pretty nice assortment of desserts as well as gelato.  Of course if you actually make it to dessert, I commend you.  Also have fruits, which has a purpose that I don't really have to make further mention of.

They have a quaint selection of deli and a fair amount of MEAT in the back. Towards the center is seafood and salad and though there wasn't much of a selection for sushi, the rolls that were there were pretty good. You can also make your own salad and they even have blue cheese. (YUCK).

The thing I like the best is that that they have a great menu of drinks you can order for a single price. You're not pinned down to mimosas. You can order anything off of the list! Rum punch is delicious.

I love that they have steamed crab legs + clarified butter. 

I like that they have lots of things I want to try a little bit of, but...

I don't like that there's nothing (besides crab legs, of course) that I just think is amazing and want to keep eating more of that single item. Nothing stands out.

Their dessert area, while plentiful, still falls short of the gorgeous, decadent desserts that Wicked Spoon offers. 

And in the neutral zone: staff. Very hit or miss. Some of the line staff is wonderful and kind, while others give you rude looks if you try to get their attention. Same thing with your dedicated server; sometimes there, sometimes not.

And here the variety is better. It hit all the requisite stations, but it did so in different ways than at traditional buffets. 

Two downsides, though: The signage for the food was poor, leaving you to guess what some items were; and the price at 3:30pm was just about $50, including tax\/tip.

The decor is not over the top. It is just a nice place to dine. I was surprised to find that on Friday to Sunday evenings your buffet also includes a whole Maine Lobster for two and all you can drink house wine.

When we first sat down it took over ten minutes before anyone came by to take our drink order. Our server seemed to not be in a good mood and we thought we might have problems, but that didn't seem to last very long and she provided very good service after our first encounter. For my wine selection I chose the Buffet's house red, which is a Merlot. I am sometimes hesitant about ordering house wines. They can tend to be watery, acidic, and have not much flavor. I was very pleased with the Buffet's house Merlot. It had a pleasant aroma, nice legs, and the flavor was acidic to the point of just giving it a little kick. The after taste was quite pleasing as well. The wine was a pleasant addition to my dining experience.

The floor of the Buffet is spread out with many live-action stations and a large selection to choose from. The selection includes what you might find in many buffets in Las Vegas, Sushi, Mexican, Italian, Prime Meats, Soups, and Deserts. But, all the selections have more of a gourmet feel to them. The salad bar is not very large, but it provides all you need to make a very nice salad. There is no iceberg lettuce to be found, only romaine and spring greens. There are many toppings for your salad as well as about a dozen dressings to choose from. They have a made to order pasta station with many pastas and toppings. The carving station has several meats including lamb, turkey and prime rib. I had a slice of the prime rib. I was surprised that I was given a thin English Cut and not a thicker slice, but the flavor was very good. Not as high quality as I would expect from a high end steak house, but the meat was tender and tasty.

One thing you don't find at all the buffets in Las Vegas is a deli station. This station has several meats, cheeses, breads, and condiments to make a quite tasty sandwich. Another item on the deli station I was pleased to find was an olive tray. There were several types of olives to delight in. Each having it's own unique flavor and texture. the Buffet at Aria is the only buffet in Las Vegas to showcase a Tandoor oven. Out of this oven comes kabobs, freshly baked naan, and one of my favorite items at the Buffet, a chicken & cheese quesadilla. Out of a Tandoor oven you may ask, yes, it was wonderful.

The last items for most people are the items in the dessert station. This station is not very large, but it does not need to be. There is a lot in this station including cookies, pastries, and freshly made ice cream. Many items are also prepared without sugar. This station is the work of World Pastry Champion Chef Jean-Philippe Maury. I had a chocolate chip cookie which was very rich. I could not finish it. I also had a scoop of their freshly made Butterfingers Ice Cream. It was very creamy and had a wonderful taste.

Its buffet is on the 2nd floor (which is hard to find) and there's no restroom near by the buffet. You need to walk to the Viva Elvis theater for it (which is hard to find too). The line was long, but since it's on the 25th, we were ready to wait.

We came in at a large group of 12 and we understand it may be hard to find a table for 12 at a busy time like this, so we decided to split our group into 2 six-people groups and hope it would be easier. The hostess took the first six-people group and then gave us a four people seat! WTH?! When we asked she insisted that she just asked for four people to come in while we actually asked for six, and claimed ""there is no other seat available at this time"" while we can clearly see some other tables for two or four available for combining them and making it six. She even insisted two of us should go back to the front cashier and start all over again. How frustrating it is for staying in the line 2 hrs and cannot get seated in? I immediately asked for speaking to the manager. He responsed very quick and politely provided resolutions, trying to resolve the seating problem. We ended up getting another two seat table separated from the table of four. Although it's not the best solution, I think I could accept that partly because the manager's attitude is nice, but mainly because I was so hungry and exhausted standing in the line. Let me have my food rather than the seating crap.

Originally I assume the Holiday dinner should have lots of selections; however Aria let me down because they only have few selection - Chinese, Italian and Indian. They served crab lag and shrimp cocktail, which is good because I paid more than $40 bucks and expect to see those. They served lamb, which is great because not every buffet served it. But the mint was a bit odd. I would hope it was like the jelly, not the green-looking sauce. As for Chinese dish, it looks like the all-you-can-eat Samwoo (place that sells roast ducks, BBQ porks, shumais etc.) with much less choices. I was not very impressed.

Their dessert looks gorgeous partly because of the glass plate they use. The Yule log is great, while another weird dessert with an tiny oreo on the top tastes like a weird combination of chocolate syrup and Robitussin. They have gelato but I am not a big fan. Not too much fruit to choose. 

Overall this buffet is so overpriced especially for its dinner. Not too many food choices here. If you come in with a large group, be prepared because hostesses don't seem to know how to handle large group seatings. If you choose to stay at Aria and wanna have a buffet, do yourself a favor by walking to Bellagio.",3,1,1

After paying I asked our host if she could have a chef walk me through as I had some dietary restrictions, she was super sweet and said one would be by shortly. A minute later a chef walked over and introduced himself, after explaining that I was vegan Chef Craig jumped right in to all the selections that were available for me to eat, even going as far as to remake any that I wanted without the butter. There was so much food, I was so happy!! After gorging I asked Chef Craig if there was any dessert or ice creams, there weren't. But he was so fantastic to go and grab me a few scoops of sorbet from the ice cream shop outside the buffet restaurant (the sorbet made at the buffet have butter in it) the flavors happened to be mango and raspberry, my favorite. It was the best sorbet I've ever had!!! So soft and silky, full of fresh fruit flavor. My bf eats meat and had a grand ol time. Server was on top of cleanliness and attentiveness, she was such a doll, was there right whenever you needed anything. Hats off to Chef Craig and his fellow chefs!! I will continue to bring my business here.",0,0,0

After reading reviews for both, I chose the dinner buffet at Aria, and I was not disappointed.

First, let me say this: I did not go to this buffet to eat gluttonously. Instead, I took small portions of several items (6 trips, which I will explain in a bit) so I could sample more items.

I added on the bottomless alcohol package for $12.99 and paired different drinks with different ""rounds"" of food. I will notate which drink I had. I had one beer, one Pinot Noir, and one Champagne. I also had a glass of club soda, which I used to cleanse my palate between items.

And yes, I took notes while eating dinner!

Round 1 - Stella Artois Beer
-----------
* Truffle Mac & Cheese - I'd never had truffles before and I love mac & cheese. This was delicious. The sauce was light, and not overpowering, and the truffles were tasty!
* Jasmine rice - This was from the Asian section. It was good - not dry at all.
* Prime Rib w\/ Creamy Horseradish - a bit dry for my liking.
* Meatball w\/ Marinara and Parmesean - I had two of these - and they were so good. The marinara sauce was a bit spicy, which was a nice and welcomed surprise.
* Multigrain roll with cranberries - I thought this was a standard multigrain roll. When I bit into it, I saw there were cranberries. Bonus! 

Round 2 - Stella Artois Beer 
-----------
* Carnivore Pizza slice (pepperoni, sausage, bacon) - It had been sitting out for a bit, and was a bit cold.
* Pineapple Sausage - This was from the Asian section - quite tasty, I liked the fact the pineapple was mixed in with the sausage. I'd never tried anything like it before.
* Chicken Pot Stickers - Cold, hard, and stuck together. Very disappointed.
* Vegetable Pad Thai - Good, but not a lot of spice\/flavor. But good.
* Beef w\/ Veggies - Similar to a Mongolian beef, w\/o peppers. Was a bit cold.
* Provolone Cheese - Wow, these were pungent!

Round 3 - Stella Artois Beer
-----------
* Beef Steamship - Like the Prime Rib, this was a bit dry. Perhaps I should have tried the au jus (in retrospect).
* Lentil Orzo - Cold pasta salad - orzo, lentil, and tomatoes. Freaking delicious!
* Portugese Sausage - One of my most favorite items all night - spicy, tender, and delicious.

Round 4 - Pinot Noir - Parducci, Mendocino City
-----------
* Clams - I tried clams for the first time....and I liked them!!
* Sirloin Oscar - Served with crab meat, bernaise sauce, and asparagus. This was grilled to order and was the highlight of my meal. Great char and flavor on the steak. I got mine Mid Rare+ (between MR and M). The Bernaise sauce was phenomenal. The crab was delicious as well!

Round 5 - Pinot Noir - Parducci, Mendocino City
-----------
* Pork Belly - Nice crispy skin, very tender meat.
* Chorizo Rope Sausage - Hello flavor explosion! Spicy and tasty!
* Au Gratin Potatoes - Very good - mild flavor, not overly cheesy.

Round 6 - Prosecco Champagne - La Marca, Veneto, Italy
-----------
* Red Velvet Whoopie Pie - Nice tender cake, great cream filling. Nuts on top.
* Creme Brule - nice glaze, but too creamy inside for my liking.
* Coconut Macaroon - Nice toasted outside. I could've eaten so many of these!
* Brownie - Rich, chocolatey - it's a brownie! But seriously, this was wonderful.
* Oreo Gelato - One word: divine.
* Cinnamon Crunch Gelato - The show stealer of the desserts. Oh. My. Gosh.

Regarding drinks, the Pinot Noir was really good for being, what I assume, to be their house Pinot. The champagne was delicious as well. In fact, I will be looking to purchase a bottle of both the Pinot Noir, and the Champagne later this week if I can find them.

While some of the carved items were dry, I will admit I did not use Au Jus, and I can only imagine the difference that would have made. There are so many choices here: Italian, Latin, Indian, Asian, Deli, Seafood, Carvery, Desserts, and much more. I did not even remotely try everything on the buffet, nor could I, as I would not have been able to eat it all. But I will try more items the next time I go back.

Do yourself a favor, and have dinner at the Aria buffet the next time you are in Vegas. Despite some of the items being cold, the service was outstanding. This place gets a solid 4.5 stars from me.",13,1,2

Thank you for including a buffet promotion with my recent stay. Overall, I do and have enjoyed your buffet during my past and current stays. The buffet is moderately priced, has a variety of culinary options (in particular a great pick for seafood lovers), and is extremely convenient. What takes away from your buffet and will impact if I return is the buffet line. For lunch, we waited over 40 minutes to get into the restaurant. Per the wait, I can only assume that all of the other patrons had a promo too. Waiting in that sort of line without a promotion is nonesense.

We declined the inexpensive addition of all you drink alcohol with our dinner. We wanna survive and remember this trip!

We were expecting more for how popular the Aria buffet lines are during the weekends, (we came on a Thursday). 

The crabs that were warm weren't cut in half, the ones that were cut in half very obviously were just barely thawed.

I was very excited to see they had one of my favorite sushi rolls, which has cream cheese and isn't that common.

The nacho cheese sauce they had gets dry and hard really fast.

Not a good selection of premade salads. I thought I saw a picture of kale salad on Yelp, but I must have been mistaken. That definitely wasn't here.

Their jalapeno sausage was just ok, more of shock taste than actually yummy.

My boyfriend liked the rib eye, though a bit fatty.

They had this cool mini cup with colorful miscellaneous vegetables in a veggie dip. Except.... the veggie dip wasn't really a dip, it was a thin liquid consistency. Yuck.

The pork dumplings and fried rice were alright.

The desserts were ok, but nothing special compared to other buffets. I liked the oreo whoopie pie the most.

Servers were pretty attentive about our waters.

AWESOME!  One of the top ones was Aria, and in the description, it sang of how eclectic it is.  My fiance loves seafood, my mom is a foodie, and I get really bored easily.  This place sounded PERFECT!  

The location is beautiful inside... extremely modern.  I was pleased to find an array of cultural dishes for my mom, a great deal of variety for me, king crab legs and snow crab legs for my fiance.  I read a lot of the bad reviews on here and disagree, but maybe I got lucky on the night I came, apparently you just shouldn't come here for brunch.

I enjoyed the Tandoori and the Carving Station.  They had garlic Na'an, it calls to me like the mothership.  The server was really sweet and attentive, and their coffee was even delicious.  I loved the dessert bar the most because it has miniature pies. cheesecakes, Grand Marnier cream puffs, and GELATO!

The thing about the Aria buffet is that it really is a destination... due to its location in Aria, most people wouldn't just happen across it while perusing the casino.  The lack of lines may be due to that.  I've seen an hour wait for Bellagio's buffet and I was not particularly impressed.",3,2,1

They had two types of crab legs- cold king crab, which was already split, and hot snow crab, which was not. I had the snow crab, but with one major issue- no crab crackers!

The hot and sour soup was just weird. The flavors were just a bit strange overall with the Asian food. I will say I loved the prime rib. I went back a couple of times for this. They cut it thicker than other buffets too. The pizza sitting out looked old so I didn't try it. I tried to tuna steaks, not bad. The crab legs were pretty tasty and already cracked for you.

Breakfast options were out in full force, with stars being the smoked eggs benedict available made to order by the omelet station- very tasty! Also memorable were the smoked trout and lox, and I'm a big fan of peel-and-eat shrimp and the ones here were large and meaty

Appreciated that there were many healthy options available, including the salad bar, lots of fresh fruit, and various oatmeal\/parfait\/grits stations with additional toppings.  The charcuterie area was quite nice, too, with a variety of sausages and all of the components for an amazing cheese plate- three cheeses, two dried meats, dried fruits, candied walnuts and roasted cashews. Very classy!

Cool to see dim sum available- haven't seen this at other places but wish the selection was a little larger. Was able to have lamb shu mai, and two other mislabelled items, but there seemed to be quite a few baskets out but only a few different items.

Was a little surprised to see the carving station available at brunch- BF took advantage of the prime rib, lamb leg, and rotisserie chicken, all of which he said were great. I tried the Yukon gold mashed potatoes, which were like heaven. No exaggeration, they were amazing!

Dessert was also impressive- all made by Jean Phillipe, super tasty and beautiful presentation. Chocolate raspberry cake pop was the favorite, would have preferred other cake pop flavors rather than so many plated cake slices. Cookies were dry and crunchy, and I prefer warm and chewy, so I did not sample any. The round, spinning ice cream case was a hit with kids and adults alike.

I'm a firm believer in quality and would rather have fewer options that are better-executed than a lot of mediocre dishes out for the sake of variety, so this is a place I prefer over some others.",6,2,3

Initially, our experience was good, our server was on top of her job; refilling our drinks, constantly checking on us, ensuring that we have all that we need until I was ready for my dessert. I went to the ice cream section, I was excited looking at all the flavors, some I want to try but I'm not sure what the flavors were. Then, suddenly the pastry guy named WILLIAM asked me what I want (at this time he was doing something, while talking to me). I responded that I want some ice cream(I answered him nicely). Then he replied with a sarcastic tone saying, ""I want to know what flavor you would like, that's what I want to know(with a sarcastic grin)"" he said. Then I answered, ""I'm actually, waiting for you to finish what you're doing so I can ask you.""(I didn't feel comfortable talking to him from afar hence, I didn't want to sound screaming, I was actually being polite to wait for him until he was finished what he was doing). And this is the response I got from him: ""Well, IF YOU KNOW HOW TO READ ENGLISH THEN YOU WOULD KNOW WHAT FLAVOR YOU LIKE(with a very sarcastic tone)."" And he just kept on talking, saying, ""And if you don't know how to read English then that's a problem."" He just didn't know when to stop talking. It was too late for me to realize that there were labels on each flavor. I honestly did not see them since my full attention was on the ice cream, deciding on what I want. I was so upset upon hearing his response. I could not contain my emotion. And he had the guts to tell me to have a Great day? Was he serious? I was offended, degraded and humiliated. He had no remorse at all. He never apologized. I was in tears when I reached our table. My husband asked me what happened, as well as the server. Immediately, the server called the manager after seeing how upset I was.

The General Manager, Grit Koppetz came and talked to me. She took the time to listen to my concern. She was very professional, respectful and pleasant the whole time. She definitely provided an utmost, quality customer service. And she did apologize for him. A very sad reality. Mr. William should have apologized. I wonder where William was when they had training on how to provide a quality customer service?

To answer your very judgmental comment Mr. William, Yes, I do speak, read, write and understand English. I do have a bachelor's degree and currently practicing my degree here. I'm a Filipina by the way. Maybe that's where the source of your judgment came from. Because I look somewhat different to you? You judged me of my ability to read English over an ice cream. 

When you send a customer home crying, something must be very wrong. I hope this will be looked into. I give 5 stars to our server and the manager. I salute you both.

Moreover, I have been a regular customer of Aria buffet. However, after this incident, I'm dubious of coming back.",6,2,0

What a disappointment!!! The food was sub par and the variety was limited. The best thing on the menu were crap legs and sushi, and that is not saying much. There was also a beef section with prime rib and beef fajitas, an Indian section, a pizza section and a Chinese food section. I use the word section very lightly because these sections had maybe 3-4 different items tops. But the taste and quality was crap! The sushi was rubbery (and the tuna was black, something I have never seen). I went with 4 other people and everybody felt like they just got ripped off. Even I will generally stuff myself at a buffet to get the proper value, but I wasn't interested. 

It might be worth mentioning that one of the people I went with got the squirts later on that night, but it may be hard to pin that on the restaurant. But the image that it provides is the right one.

I would recommend going to the buffet at the M resort. It has better quality, more items and is a few bucks cheaper.

The buffet at Aria is a solid buffet option and should be checked out if you're staying at the hotel. 

My girlfriend, parents and I checked out this buffet for the Sunday champagne brunch. The food is good, the service we had wasn't so good, though. Our waiter enjoyed talking to my flight attendant mother about the recent Steven Slater incident but he didn't see much of a need to refill our drinks. It came to a point where I gave my Dad the cup of coffee he gave me that I didn't order so my Dad could have a second cup. We're happy to socialize and discuss the issues of the day with the staff, part of the fun of Vegas is interacting with anyone and everyone around, but you still have a job to do. 

Things I enjoyed: breakfast burritos, ice cream, biscuits, cheese blintzes, Grand Marnier Creme Puff dessert, all very yummy. I thought it was very cool how the desserts were so artfully presented. And to the other people who couldn't find the crab legs? How couldn't you? There were stacks and stacks of them around. The champagne was decent, too. 

The atmosphere of the place is not unlike the buffet at the Mirage (my personal favorite). It has bright colors and an open design. The walls did feel somewhat sparse, but I thought the color scheme was well done.

This is basically, a cheap buffet with crab legs and shrimp. 
The only reason I gave it a 2 star because the deserts are better than dishes.

We had 10 in our group and didn't have to wait very long for a seat, which was a blessing after a long night of clubbing\/drinking, etc. 

The king crab legs were plentiful and meaty and the salad bar had fresh blueberries and blackberries along with all the other veggie goodies.  The belgian waffles were soft and fluffy and the breakfast burrito was surprisingly tasty (i think it was chorizo and egg).  The prime rib was delicious and the garlic naan was good too.  An entire side of asian dishes wasn't what I expected for brunch, but they had a lot of options.  I only tried the chinese broccoli, peking duck and the dim-sum.  I made the mistake of putting plum sauce on my peking duck, and it was horribly salty.  The duck in the steamed bun would have been okay by themselves.  The dim sum wasn't bad.  Good chicken noodle soup too.   

Their desserts were so pretty it's almost hard to eat them...almost.  The strawberry shortcake was delicious, as was the caramel flan.  The strawberry bread pudding was decent, and when mixed with the bananas foster, it was really good.

One of my friends asked for tea, and the server brought him a wonderful lavender Earl Grey tea....yet, when another friend in our group asked for tea, he was brought an herbal tea that tasted like bad potpourri and perfume. :(  If you ask for tea, make sure to ask what your options are.

The crawfish was pretty gross but the other cold seafood dishes were decent. I preferred the cooked fish dishes.

Next the food seemed to get saltier as the night went on. We got crab legs few at a time at various times and they started to get saltier. Are they leaving all the legs in a salt bath and not take them out at a set time? The tandoori chicken used to be really good where I'd go there and have a plate of chicken. This time is was dry. The lamb stew was flavorful but lamb was dry as can be. Also swordfish, don't get me started. It should have been let go and swam free to save a life not kill it and then kill it again with over cooked fish. Hargow dumplings, mind you I grew up eating them so I'm very particular and know plenty about them since I grew up helping my mom make them, so these were very bad. Like I refuse to swallow bad.

This isn't really a buffet to go out of your way for in Vegas, but is a nice option if you're already there.

It's only $21 for lunch. If you want all-you-can-drink wine, then try the $37 dinner. The good stuff (aka Gourmet with Lobster) is only served Friday and Saturday dinner. If you are used to Las Vegas buffets, then the pile of crab legs, small selection of sushi, meats, pastas, and salads will seem very familiar. Nothing really stood out or sucked. I liked the pasta with alfredo sauce for some reason and a simple salad. Maybe it was because we were towards the end of our stay. Of course, desserts are a highlight of any Vegas buffet and the same is true at Aria with little cakes, pastries, and ice cream.",23,23,22

The first roadblock to someone attending a Vegas buffet is cost. The Aria Buffet is reasonably priced at $32 for a non-alcoholic buffet and $36 for a bottomless champagne or bloody mary attachment. Um, if you're wincing at the $4 dollar difference, than you're probably not a drinker or have been hit hard by the gambling bug and do not want to open your wallet further than it already has been.

The 2nd part of a buffet equation is the quality and amount of choices given to a diner. Now, it is most certainly a form of gluttony and excess (what Vegas does in abundance...). The Buffet at The Aria gives you plenty of choices from bahn mi and soba noodles to the quintessential crab legs. There is a glorious carving station that offers mahi mahi, prime rib, ham, and turkey. You can also brunch it up with a French toast and pancake section. You want warm fruit nestled in sauce for your pancakes or French toast? No problem! Scrambled eggs w\/o gluten more your thing, well, they have that as well!

The standout of this trip to the buffet, though, is the bottomless champagne. My friends and I made sure we were always with flutes of mimosas. The waitress was ever-so-generous and she was as attentive w\/o being overtly pressuring. She kept the birthday weekend going and she deserved every bit of the generous tip we left her.

After nom nom noming our way through copious amounts of food items, we settled and conquered the dessert section. This place is immaculate! From cherry cheesecake to a bounty of cookies, this dessert section is one of the brighter sides of the buffet.

From attentive service to reasonably priced Vegas buffet, the Aria houses a great option for those staying and for those looking for an alternative to the long lines @ Wicket Spoon or Bacchanal. I recommend it for all those looking for a buffet to conclude or begin one's Vegas trip.",4,2,1

I like a good buffet every now and then.  I redeemed a few MyVegas vouchers for my friend and I.  Buy 1 get one free buffet, and two unlimited beverage passes.  I DO recommend the buffet, I do not recommend the additional $12.99 beverage pass, unless maybe you're going with options like beer, or sangria...options I didn't try during my brunch.  I guess I'll start with that part of the experience.  My friend and I tried a bloody mary - when I asked what the difference was between the two kinds, it was just one was spicier than the other, and they ARE pre-mixed, so nothing special.  We weren't thrilled with them so we got the mimosas...which weren't any better.  The orange juice seemed ""fresh"" with a tad of pulp, but not sure about the rest...it wasn't light or bubbly or anything.

As for the food... we stopped in for brunch.  There weren't a whole lot of breakfast options, but what they had was good...as for the rest, they had EVERYTHING! Italian, seafood, sushi, salad bar, asian, you name it!!! And I can't say enough NICE things about the dessert options, along with a tasty gelato section which had flavors like peanut butter pretzel, and cinnamon toast crunch.

I will say, if you're in a bit of a hurry...and have the drink pass, you do have a 3 hour time limit.  We didn't plan on having a 3 hour brunch anyway, but the service was a bit slow on the beverages so I'd keep that in mind if that was an option you were considering.

Overall, the Aria is wonderful...the buffet is as well, lots of options and very clean!",8,3,3

For $48 dollars each, you get unlimited food, wine, and they also serve lobster tail. But after being seated, we realized there was a lack of staff, and we were getting pretty thirsty. We flag down a person who looks to be ranked higher, and explain that we'd like our server so we can get some soda or water, or wine even.

Finally, I take my receipt and I go to walk to the front to complain, because according to my receipt, I have been sitting here for 20 mins with no drink, no ""hi i'm so and so"" no nothing.

As i'm about to instigate, I notice a lady with what looks to be our drinks on her tray. So I went back and didn't complain. We got our drinks and then we went to get our plates for the buffet.

Everything looked really really good - presentation gets an A to A+ for the most part, however the 20 min wait for drinks should have been our first indication...

I placed a few items on my plate: tamale, white Indian rice, tandoori chicken, asparagus, potatoes, pineapple and cantaloupe, a slice of steak meat, and some pita bread.

All of it tasted either bland, bad, nasty, awful, or worse.

Round 2: pita bread, indian white rice, curry vegetables on top.

I want my $48 dollars back. I should have kept walking past the waitress lady and complained like I was doing, but I backed out because I didn't want to be the asshole in my group who complained.

Well, realize you need ""bad guys"" sometimes, who will point the finger and hold others accountable: This place took over 20mins to get us soda, and their food was so bad we all almost had to get McDonalds or something to cover up the nasty food we just ate.

The servers behind the food counters are disengaged and surly. If they answer a question, it's in clipped tones  without meeting your eyes. Our waitress only picked up our empty dishes twice. 

The food was so mediocre that it should have sold at a discount, not at $33 for breakfast \/brunch. How can they get cut fruit wrong? They all tasted like they were soaked in water before being brought out. 

I have some advice for the management. If you want to keep the price that you currently have, you need some serious upgrades.

1. Don't hire the cheapest staff. 
2. Train them in the basics of customer service or make them work behind the scenes. 
3. Don't use canned soups. People can tell. 
4. Don't use frozen dimsum. It's really bad. 
5. Don't up charge for seafood then serve C grade product. Your shrimps were the size of a babies pinky finger.

I had everything from their hummus and pita chips, to their crab legs, their chorizo breakfast burrito and their cinammon bun. Their hashbrowns were surprisingly great! Crispy and not too oily. Their fruit salad (banana and strawberry) was kinda bland. They had a few kinds of meats, cheeses, an omelette station, some crazy giant three layer pancake and a good handful of flavors of ice cream to end your meal. They also had dumplings, oysters, crayfish and pizza. Good range of foods, alright tasting but service lacked.

During our most recent stay, Jan 8-13, 2017, we decided the late morning was a great fit for the plans we'd made on 2 days.

We were greeted warmly at the front check-in and our servers were wonderfully attentive on both on both occasions, this trip AND previously.  

I am a big fan of hot tea, and it's the caffeine I just really must have to get my day off to a great start.  I know hot tea is a pain for a server because there is a separate pot of water, tea bags, etc. On both visits, our servers NEVER let my hot tea pot become empty!  Both were ahead of my requests when I'd finish a pot of tea, and had a new hot water and tea bag ready to serve.  This may sound very minimal, but to me, it's HUGE.  In some restaurants, this is not the case and I am lucky to see another pot of tea; but at the Aria,  my tea never ran dry. Thank you for feeding my caffeine needs!

The buffet was lovely.  I don't go to a buffet to eat a ton of food; I go to get a 'little of this' and 'a little of that' and Aria buffet has such a great selection of lovely fresh prepared foods from all over the world, so my little of this and that became a world food event.  For me, it's about QUALITY and SELECTION, not the quantity of food I can eat to just stuff myself for the day ahead.

My favorite thing on the buffet at Aria is the butternut squash bisque.  It is to die for!  Rich, creamy and the taste....INCREDIBLE!  Most people don't eat soup at a buffet; in my opinion, the butternut squash is an absolute MUST TRY for everyone. It is excellent.

The 'beef steamship' is really tasty.  Craved fresh and the taste is amazing.

While the buffet has an enormous selection, as I said, I just want a little of this and that, so I could not try everything.  My husband had the Chili Verde and said it was the best he'd ever had, anywhere, ever.  We've been all over the world, and he's a real taste-master when it comes to Chili Verde, so for him to give it that review, it must be great. If you are into Chili Verde, this one is a must to try.

I tried a few items from the Asian style buffet and everything was tasty and served hot. The Shu Mai was delicious and worth each bite.  The pork buns were great, too, as was the rice, but the rice not quite as sticky as Chinese rice.  

The station with foods of India was nice, but I don't go for that curry flavor too often, so that one I skipped, though it smelled and looked delicious.

The seafood station featured mounds piled high of fresh shrimp and crab legs!  Beautifully displayed and great tasting. 

The fresh green beans were excellent and cooked  to perfection.

I've made eggs Benedict at home for my hubby, but never had tried it until Buffet at Aria.  I loved it!!!  Cooked to perfection!

There were so many other choices at other stations, but as I said, I just could not eat that much and I know I missed a lot of great tasting foods.

The dessert station is ridiculous!!!  So many choices, all of them amazing.  I know my daughter loves the gellato bar.  I saw it, but just could not fit in another bite.  There is a lovely layered chocolate mousse bar which I found absolutely delicious and the perfect ending to my meal.

Here's a tip that is for everyone.  If you want to just linger over coffee\/tea and you know you just don't want to chow-down and rush off, we find it good to give a nice gratuity to your server at a buffet PRIOR to eating.  This practice has always served us well at any buffet.  Many times customers overlook the server, which I think is very wrong.  We tip our server when our drinks arrive and then explain that we will be there to enjoy our coffee and talk a bit, providing there are not lines of people waiting to be seated.  Our servers have ALWAYS been delighted and also accommodate us in every possible way.  Sure, you go to Vegas to have fun and win, right?  Well, we see winning over a very busy server to be a big win.  It makes the server's day better and it's a nice enjoyable time for us.  I know the mindset of some is 'well, I am serving myself so why tip?'  That thinking is WRONG.  The servers are there refilling your drinks, taking empty plates and making your experience the best it can be.  A meal is an event; part of your Vegas experience!  Tip your server well AHEAD of when you leave and you will enjoy a lovely, unhurried meal.  Trust me, if there are 2 in your party, a $20 pre-meal tip will go further than you can imagine.  Try it and you'll see what I mean.  When there are more in your party, that amount should be more.  Yes, it's like a 50% gratuity, but it's totally worth it.

* Price: $42 for 2 for breakfast.. not cheap but cheaper than Jean Phillips or any restaurants in this area. 4 star.

* Ambiance: clean, simple decor. Farmer market feels. 4 star. 

* Location:  on the promenade level, by the pool area. Convenient to stop by here before or after hanging out at the pool. Far away from the casino... so you don't have to eat with cigarette smokes. 4 star. 

* Meals: fresh.  There are plenty of choices from bagels, oatmeals,  salads to dim sum, roasted beef, omelet... There are a sort of pastries but not much of desert for breakfast.  Food quality is good but not very exciting nor inventive like Wicked Spoon or the Bellagio 's buffet.  4 star. 

* Service: friendly waitress. 4 star.

Thus, it is averaged to 4 star based on my PALMS rating! 
 
We did enjoy the seafood station with cocktail shrimps,  crawfish, crab legs, clams and muscles.  The sushi station is very simple with veggie rolls and spicy tuna rolls.

i've tried nearly all the buffets in vegas (that are worth trying): wynn, bellagio, carnival, mandalay bay, paris, orleans, mgm, monte carlo. and this was definitely one of the top. i personally liked wynn and mandalay bay the most, but it was a while ago so i don't know how they compare exactly with this one. but so far, i am pretty impressed with the buffet at aria.

upon entering, i noticed the hefty tag of  $35 on fri\/sat for dinner. ouch! but i've never been so i'll check it out. thinking i won't come back again.

Yes the buffet is pricey. service is a little slow, they're short on servers, but she was friendly.

But for an extra $5 you get half a lobster. 
Also it's unlimited wine!
And for the extra $5 you get lamb, ny steak AND prime rib. as well as turkey and pork.
crab legs and HUGE and pretty fresh cocktail shrimps!

they even had salmon nigiri sushi! it didn't look appetizing, but at least it wasn't just california rolls!

honestly, those are the things you pay for a buffet anyways. everything else is filler food. and i actually got SO FULL from all that, i could barely have any filler food.

THEY ALSO HAD MACAROONS!!! it was strawberry flavoured. a little sweet, but not bad nonetheless. 

unfortunately they don't have a crepe maker like wynn does. i didn't really get to try the dessert either becasue i was so full o_O

I tried:
Half lobster - only one per person. it was alright. a little small, but it's worth $5. a little too creamy for my liking, but hey, it's a lobster!

Crab leg - salted, not bad, not stale or anything, didn't make me feel sick. so i think it's relatively fresh

Shrimp cocktail - my goodness, these are huge and pretty fresh! the best shrimp cocktail i've had from any buffet!

Prime rib - a little fatty, I got the middle part and it was cooked medium

ny steak - i got a pretty thick piece. it was pretty good

lamb - a little dry i think, but it was alright. wish it was a little rarer.

they even had kebabs, which was a little dry. i also tried the salmon salad which was pretty good too.

after all that i was SO STUFFED that i couldn't try anything else. but i think i ate my money's worth. and that's the most important thing to me in a buffet.

so yes, it may be a little steeper, but at least you get your money's worth unlike most buffets where you pay $30 and the only thing worth eating is the shrimp, prime rib and crab legs.

everything looked nicely put together and appetizing, which i realized is pretty important to me after experiencing the wynn buffet. paris, for example, was way too messy, and the food just didn't seem that great.

I'm sad i didn't get to try much of the dessert, so i can't really comment on that. 

they also had a made to order pasta, and some of their soup didn't look half bad either.

tip: $35 for fri\/sat nights. $22\/24? for lunch. so decide what you want to pay for.

favourites: GOOD variety! lamb, prime rib AND ny steak! fresh shrimp cocktail and crab legs PLUS half a lobster! hell yea!!! and unlimited wine ;)

do not want: yes a little steep. you have no option but go for the $35. service is slow

last words: it's definitely one of the top vegas buffets i think. fresh, good variety (not lacking, and worthy of the steep cost) i'll definitely come back again! probably only one time though! then i am officially quitting vegas buffets =p",6,5,5

I did a lot of research on multiple sites. I was with 2 companions who are gluten free, so wanted to make sure that they had enough choices. Many Yelp (and other) reviews mentioned this buffet as one that had a lot of gf options; general consensus was that the food was good. Neither was true.  

First of all, if you're going within the next couple of weeks, beware - the price is NOT what's listed on the website, dinner Mon-Thurs $36.99.  Yes, there's an asterisk that says that prices may vary during holiday weeks - maybe it was there last week and I just missed it, but I sure missed it. So it was quite a shock to hear that 3 buffets with the ""unlimited pour"" (alcohol) came to about $215. Of course we could have left, but it was after 9:30 at night, we were very hungry, and my elderly relative just could not walk any more (you have to walk through what feels like a mile of Aria to get to the buffet).  So okay, it will be our big splurge meal.

Wow, what a mistake.  There were a few items that were good, one or two that were okay, and quite a few that were not good at all. Nothing outstanding.The service was good, our server was attentive and friendly, but it didn't come close to making up for the food.
- Beef (steamship) and shrimp were good
- Clams (tiny manila clams) were fine, mussels were not so good. Crab legs were, well, buffet crab legs.
- Salad bar wasn't huge, but was fine. Pre-made salads looked great but were mostly pretty bad.
- Vegetables - tasteless
- Salmon and baked chicken - dry and tasteless
- Leg of lamb - grey and hard, not a great flavor
- Mashed potatoes - how do you mess up mashed potatoes? By putting in WAY too much salt (and we are a group that likes salt!); they also looked dried out, like they'd been sitting there all night
- Crawfish - horrible. Inedible. I spit it out. 
- Desserts: meh. Nothing particularly great. Creme brulee was okay. Gelato was okay, but it's not self serve so you can't take tiny amounts of several to see what you like.
- Gluten free options: My mistake perhaps, but when I hear that a place has gluten free options I don't think that means they have rice and salad. Of course those are gluten free, duh, but I expected more. There is gluten free pizza, if you ask for it; the pizza guy seemed quite taken aback by the request but made one for us. It was fine. Woo hoo. Gluten free desserts were gelato (some flavors, others had pretzels or cookies or whatever), creme brulee, and I think a chocolate mousse. That's it. We asked the lady serving gelato if any desserts were gluten free. She was clearly trying to help us but clearly English was not her first, second or any number language. Her response was ""spoons on table.""

I'm subtracting 1 star because there was a large group of us eating there (about 12 adults, plus I think 3 kids), & they said they'd have to charge an extra $100 bucks to seat us together. My cousin voluntarily paid - through the nose. Never in my life had I heard of an extra $100 charge to seat a big group together. Maybe that's Aria's version of 'Welcome to Vegas'. I'm not sure the place was full, but yeah.

Apart from the annoying $100 charge & the ""the buffet"" logo with its awful kerning (sorry), there really was nothing to complain about. Vegas really does have amazing chefs, & a bunch of them are at Aria. The place has a young, modern feel to it; the food selection was diverse (there was pizza amongst all the sushi & lobster -- or was that crawfish? no idea, hehe); the seafood was fresh & clean but flavorful; the desserts were adventurous & artistic.

For my other friend and myself the sushi and fish dishes were good, but not outstanding. I thought the Chicken Parmesan to be very good, we both loved the baby beets and lamb with mint jelly.

Desserts were ok, the pistachio ice cream was a hit with all three of us. With tax and tip the cost for all 3 was just shy of $150. We decided that was a bit steep - perhaps brunch or a weekday dinner if we were in the neighborhood. For this cost I'd rather be at the Wynn.

two other things i love , and i don't see it at any other buffet, were

- their chicken curry w\/ freshly made garlic naan: i know, who eats naan at buffet? i didn't want to but it was so good that i had to go back and get more and more!!! their naan was freshly made, and the curry has a little spice to it which makes it PERFECT!

prime ribs and chickens were good too... so does their desert bar... one thing though: we couldn't find the fruits, ANYWHERE? no fruits?!?!?!

i like that they have the restrooms inside the buffet so you don't have to go out to wash your hand (or you know... so you can eat more after you.... you know... LOL)

The food here has always been bland, and the selection less than mediocre. 
The one standout was their brisket; but alas, I just found out that it has been eliminated. 
Also note that although lunch PRICING starts at 11am, they don't put out any beef until 1pm. So enjoy your sausage in the meantime :(
I actually only ever came here to have the brisket. 
My advice:
For the same price, head to Bellagio, or Wynn. For $10 more, and infinitely better quality and selection, go to Caesar's Palace. I think the line there (and lack of line at Aria) speaks for itself. 
Want to eat at Bellagio, but don't want to stand in the long line? MLife and Hyatt are partners. Since MLife stays also count as Hyatt stays, 5 stays at MLife hotels (including the cheap Excalibur) will earn you Platinum status with Hyatt.

The worst part was that the dining room was only about three quarters full and if they had filled the entire room there would only be a line about half as long.  (And you would think that they would want to run at capacity as it was a Saturday afternoon.)  Another bad thing that they did was to not even have the table set when they sat us.  So our hostess showed us to our table which had no glasses, no cutlery, nothing at all really on it.  So we decided to go check out the buffet line and even after getting our food we arrived back to find the table as we had left it.  And this was about 10mins after we had first been seated, still no way to eat our food.  So we went to an unoccupied table and took the cutlery off of there.

Well now on to the food.  This food was not spectacular at all, and you think it would be from this beautiful upscale hotel but it was just a letdown.  The crab had no taste and was just bland.  Even adding salt and butter didn't help this crab.  It tasted like they may have killed it three times over.  It is hard to even remember anything spectacular on the buffet line.

I didn't try their other carved meats like their chicken, brisket, ham etc however they all looked delicious.  The mac and cheese and other sides were amazing.

Reason i only give it a 3 is because for a buffet to get anything higher i think the food should not taste like ""buffet"" food.   Especially when your dropping 40 to 50 bucks including tax and tip.   Some buffets do this.   Aria doesn't.   I think for less money you could go to any of the lower end hotels and still get the same buffet and same food.  Aside from the carved meat station and the seafood (crab legs and peeled shrimp) everything else wasn't even good it was average at best.   Mexican food stale.  Asian food stale and horrible.   The rest were standard things like fried chicken breasts potato wedges etc.

If your gonna come here go straight to the carved meats (rotisserie chicken, prime rib, brisket, etc).  Otherwise if your looking for the same quality but save some money go to planet hollywood or anywhere else its cheaper.

Then I tried the crab legs which are chilled.  They are snow crab legs halved.  It was more difficult to extract the meat than expected and what's worse, they were too salty.  Other food groups including smattering of Chinese offerings all looked pretty unappetizing.

I usually have a great appetite but I stopped after one serving.

In summary, this is a truly mediocre and disappointing effort from Aria.  I am not sure if I would try this even if I get comped again",0,0,0

In fact, for the price you pay, I'd rather go to ""those"" kinda buffets for half the price....at least, you're not expecting much.

I went for brunch. And maybe, I'm an idiot but, they should serve BRUNCH. All the brunch I really saw was the breakfast foods, eggs benedict, and mimosas.

The Chinese food was HORRIBLE. Might as well go to Panda Express but, the difference is Panda's beef broccoli tastes good. The broccoli wasn't fully cooked and the beef was cooked too much....practically fried.

Sushi sucked. Although what can you really expect from buffet sushi, right. 
Pizza sucked. I'd rather have those frozen pizzas you make at home!

Even the desert bar wasn't too crackin'...I mean, you have all the flavors of ice cream\/yogurt\/whatevs BUT, CHOCOLATE. Ughhh, fail. You gotta have chocolate...it's a staple!

Not so boring with an ever present omelet station but there were lots of great selections of soup, Asian, Mediterranean, Tandoori, south of the border, sandwich, salad, seafood and carving station (with baked potatoes!) to name just a few.

After days of super rich food that Vegas fine dining offers, it was refreshing to have some feel good food like cabbage with stuffed veggie and taste bud awaking cuisine from tandoori grill. And the steamed crab legs were actually really sweet, succulent and not so salty (unlike in many high end Vegas buffets)!!

And it was good to see that there were some vegan, gluten free and sugar free options as well.

Some misses were -

* At check in: despite being on express lane with mLife pearl and up status, hostess seated non-express line first, twice. 

* Grilled veggies looked really good but there were actually not cooked thoroughly.

I don't usually eat crab legs, but since I payed so much for the buffet I thought I might as well give it a shot.

I'm glad I gave it a chance.

Had to pay around $36 for the Holiday Dinner price since I came here on Thanksgiving. Pricey. But way more worth it the Cafe Vettro located in Aria also. 

I think the server for my table sucked. She brought us our drinks and everyone else at my table had a straw for their drink except for me. I asked her kindly for a straw and she handed me a straw that was in a Coke.... she handed it to me while it was still dripping with Coke and I just looked really disgusted as I grabbed it.

Umm, not really :\/ the tandoori section (which was just alright, nothing special Indian food) has a rice pilaf, couple curried and overcooked chicken tandoori. Other vegetarian dishes included quinoa salad, Asian soup, made to order veggie pasta, bread and cheese selection, Mac and cheese and salad and corn on Cobb. So, not worth the $28. If you enjoy sea food and meats in general, then maybe this place would be 7\/10. The problem wasn't only the selection of food, but also the taste.

Lots of good desserts and our favorites were key lime pie, the chocolate cake, carrot cake, ice creams and the star was the pomegranate meringue which was absolutely yum!!!

First off the Pros: 
Bottomless wine, lobster(although limited to half a lobster\/ person), clean, wait service was real good, and the desserts. 

Cons: 
Food was par at best, bland and greasy, a bit pricy for the food that was served. 

Straight forward, the food was ok.. nothing special although they had crab legs, lamb, and prime rib. There were both pretty dry and I'm not usually the biggest fan of au jus. I had a plate and a half of random foods and nothing that especially peaked my interest including their crab legs. So I decided to go straight to dessert, I mean truthfully no one can screw up anything with sugar in it right? Because of my huge sweet tooth, the desserts definitely hit the spot after a standard meal. 

The banana foster was yummy, some chocolate cake was also really good, I also got some of the ice cream or gelato (don't seem to remember), and a number of their cookies. If what you need is dessert, than this place will indeed suffice. 

I would rather make the drive to M resort where prices are cheap and food is better than Aria and the desserts are also bomb!

I was in complete disarray of how horrible Bellagio was this time, compared to the last time I went there.  From a large walkway to accommodate lots of people searching for what they want to pile on their plates, to the modern decor, the Aria buffet was definitely a breath of fresh air.  Of course getting in for free does help quite a bit, thanks to myVegas.  

There is a lot of selection to choose from.  Some of the food is already pre-portioned, allowing ease for people to just grab what they desire.  They have types of cuisine which are typical at any buffet.  The dessert selection is also a delight, which features gelato, cakes, pastries, and an assortment of tarts.

The service was good, the restaurant was very nice in appearance, and the hygiene was excellent.

The price tag was quite frightful, $78 for 2. They charge extra during ""holiday"" season =December. The ""holiday"" extra charge is for having holiday items which means they have pumpkin gelato and cheesecake...seriously.

We went for brunch.

Meats were flavorless, seafood plain, waffles and crepes dry, eggs nice and creamy, yogurt was yummy, the Indian food was worth returning for, chinese looked very unappealing and tasted generic, the majority of dessert were muffins, croissants, donuts, but they had gelato- best coffee ice cream I've had, and 4 cake options- carrot was dry but the vanilla cupcake was delightful.

Yes I sampled pretty much everything. For that price I was going to make sure I at least gained 10 lbs by the time I waddled out.

We decided to go to the Aria buffet because we were staying the Vdara and there are no restaurants at the Vdara.  We went on a Friday night and got scammed on the price.  For 2 people the buffet cost over $90.  They told us it was the gourmet buffet.  Evidently gourmet means king crab legs and oysters even when the everyday buffet has snow crab legs.  Serious disappointment.  All buffets on the strip are the same; same food, same prices.  Go to Freemont Street to get a buffet at a better price.",0,0,0

The decor was more like a high school cafeteria.  Quite a let down for such a high end casino.  The service at the table was alright, but the waittress appeared overwhelmed at times.  Thus, service was intermittent.  The service at the stations, especially grilled meats, was horrendous.  The server was condensing and obnoxious.  We were afterall paying for the food (actually too much!)... just serve it over already.  

The food selection was quite skimpy. Quality of the grill meat was satisfactory.  Otherwise, there was nothing else worth checking out, except for the sweets.

The lobster, small as it was, was tasty, but missing one of its claws.  We had two lobsters at our table and they were each missing a claw.  Someone at our table thought that the missing claws most likely ended up in the lobster ravioli's they were serving that night.  The red wine was mediocre but the white wine was decent.  

I would recommend going to the Bellagio buffet instead eventhough that has also diminished in quality over the years.  You get more bang for your buck, nicer service, and better decor.",0,0,0

I wasn't a fan of the sushi because the rice wasn't cooked all of the way. They also have a deal for bottomless mimosas that are mostly champagne and a splash of oj (we are okay with that).
They have tons of fresh fruit, breakfast foods, sea food, pizza, cheese platter and salami (my weakness), a area where they can make you crepes. I'm not a sweets type of person, but my boyfriend said it was very good with the chocolate Nutella on it. They also had carrot pancakes which he said were really good too.

I had brunch\/lunch here and it was mediocre at best. It was about $40 a person because there's a 18% gratuity charge for parties over 6 or 8 (I can't remember). If you wanted to do bottomless mimosas\/wine\/champagne, then that's an additional $16.99 from what I can remember. 

Although the buffet itself has a wide variety of cuisines, the selection felt a bit limited and repetitive. 

The wonton soup here is good! The wontons it self are delicious, and they don't skimp on the filling like regular buffets, however the broth itself was FAR TOOO SALTY. I felt like I was just gulping down spoonfuls of salt...so I just finished the wontons and left it at that. 

I also really enjoyed the pizza, because the crust was thin, and the cheese to dough ratio was perfect. However, everything else didn't really stand out. 

The best part of this buffet would probably have to be its desserts section. There is a rotating gelato\/ice cream thing and my friends and I were so mesmerized by it. And the pistachio, carmel macchiato, and citrus flavors were sooooo good. I also liked that they had Thai Tea in cute little bottles and specialty juices like strawberry lemonade and pom juice. 

Other than that, there's really nothing exceptional about this buffet. I have no point of reference to compare it to the other buffets in Vegas, but from what my friends who were there told me, they preferred the Wicked Spoon over this.",1,0,0

I tried the lunch buffet at Caesars, Cosmo, Aria, and M Resort.  This was, by far, the worst buffet I've ever visited.  Every dish was overcooked.  The steak was impossible to cut.  Bland flavors.  They did have Indian food... which was ok, but man... I couldn't get out of here fast enough.  Even the desserts were crappy... which is usually pretty hard to mess up.

The high price and the whole lining up for an hour even though it's empty inside is a bit of downer! I went early, around 4pm and didn't expect to be stuck in a 30 person queue for so long and to my dismay it was less than a third full when I got seated so I'm not sure what the holdup is for ? Make it look busy to passer by's ?

The food is pretty good though, crab legs were plentiful and there were plenty of hot seafood choices like boiled clams, fish and chips and jambalaya. They had an authentic tandoor oven which they were making fresh naan and tandoori chicken which was great, the chicken well marinated, moist and having the smokey oven scent. The roasts were nicely done and they even had slider burgers which were a nice touch.

The Chinese selection is a little bit small but decent, the satay chicken skewers were popular and the peanut sauce was nicely done. There were the usual fares of pizza, pastas and cold meats which I didn't indulge in.

Like most buffets, there was a large selection of desserts but the thing that stands out at the Aria buffet was the large selection of sorbet. Heaps of flavours to choose from stored in a rotating freezer which was pretty cool.

Service was great and efficient from the waiter but the fact that my waiter moved to a different section halfway through my meal made it hard to justify my tip as the second waiter had less to do by the time he took over with my table.

The night we went we had a choose of Merlot or Chardonnay, I think it may change from time to time. 
For the price, I wasn't supper happy with the food. 
The lobster was quite delicious and the they had both snow crabs and dungeness (but they were cold). Other than that nothing else in the buffet was memorable or worth really having seconds.

Buffets in Vegas are not cheap like you would think. It was $70 for two (not including tip) and that is without ordering any drinks.

We got the bottomless deal from a lady cashier at the door. But she forgot to give us wrist bands( they can't serve us drinks without the wrist bands). When I waited at the table, our waitress informed us about the wrist bands. Then I went to the front again to ask for 2 wrist bands with the receipt in my hands. The lady cashier was gone at the time, and it was that jerk who was on duty. So I showed him the receipts, and told him what happened. He looked at the receipt and said: I can only give you one wrist band, you have to bring the other party to the front to get his. I told him we started eating 30 mins ago and didn't even get any drinks, and now you want me to bring the other party to the front when you guys forgot to give them to us in the first place?! His answer to me was hey I didn't sell the ticket to you, it was not my problem. 


Umm I thought in Vegas is all about service. I understand it was you didn't sell me the ticket and it wasn't your fault, but you work here. You supposed to solve the problem, not make it worse just because it wasn't your fault. I probably would made my company to come to the front to get the wrist band had he said anything other than what was said to us. 

I am a business owner myself, and I know if my employees ever make such comments, he or she will be the first one to let go when the annual evaluation comes up. It is not about making the mistakes, it's about the mentality\/attitude after the mistake occurs. 

To sum up, 2 things will not make me to come back. 1, the food quality does not worth the price, even with the crab legs and lobsters(you can get better quality seafood at Costco with the same price  you pay here, and steaks\/lamb rack as well, or just go try Bacchanal at Caesar). Noted, I said food quality. The restaurant made me feel messy and unclean. I guess it was the presentation of the food, and the quality of the seafood and meat. The table at the seafood section appeared to be very dirty and messy. Compare to all other buffets in Vegas, I think they did a bad job at presentation and clean up. The soup is always luke warm, or may be because I was placed at the further end of the table and I walk slow. Who knows?

What I didn't like: Their turkey from the carving station was dry. The salad bar was lacking ingredients (corn, croutons, tomato). The bread rolls were dry almost completely hard.

The wait staff is second to none. They were super attentive and friendly and collectively made the best service experience I've ever had in Vegas.

So here's the bad part. Two days in to our voucher deal they nearly doubled the price per person for the buffet. They called it ""Holiday Brunch"" or something like that. Nothing changed (food or service) except for the price which went up $20 dollars per person. The ""free"" buffet deal turned out to be anything but. The place wasn't even more crowded than usual.

I understand Vegas exists to vacuum the cash out of your bank account but the gimmick pulled by Aria's management over the buffet price amounted to cheating their customers.

Actually we both loved ourselves some bacon so it was no surprised we picked up platefuls for the breakfast here.  It was golden, crispy and just perfectly seasoned.

Service was nice and the d√©cor was pretty good too.  While the selection was nice, it wasn't as big as some of its counterparts.  Aside from the bacon, some of the other dishes were just ok.

Cost: 38$ for lunch
When: Monday (1:05 PM)

Cons: long line wait (1 hour wait, so started eating at 2PM) and bad service originally (our server Mary Ann messed up drink orders, showed up only twice the entire time we were there (but we spotted her chatting with other servers on the side), etc. Other waitress rudely told us she won't help us because ""it's not my section"" when I asked if she could get us something to drink after we waited 16 minutes from first being seated).

Pro: cool food setup (gelato dessert rotating wheel and stone oven cooked tortilla), new server (Yugasov?) extremely hard working, decent variety of food, AMAZING tastes (nothing was overpoweringly seasoned or sauced, etc. It tasted like restaurant quality cuisine), and aesthetically pleasing layout.

Bathroom layout and cleanliness: 3.5 out of 5.

Overall: think it's worth a trip on a less busy day (use MyVegas or discounts). As other reviewers say, it's no Bacchanal Buffet, but it's still a delicious visit. So 7 out of 10 for me (due to wait and initial service).",9,0,0

Saturday afternoon, no wait, no line, no problem! As soon as we were seated, we went straight for the food! The Buffet has an array of foods from around the world and a chef at every station. I got a little but of everything and I loved it!
My favorite though, being a seafood foodie, were the crab legs! They were steamed to perfection! Absolutely amazing! Highly recommend those. You should just grab a plate specifically only for crab legs. They do have a salad bar and a dessert bar! The new York cheesecake was really good and the Gelato tasted so fresh! Yum!

Lots of bad reviews before the revamp -- I never tried the buffet back then. But I've eaten here after the remodel (both food and decor), and I actually enjoyed this buffet. It doesn't have the variety and flashiness like with Bellagio, Wynn, or Wicked Spoon, but it'll satisfy the belly if you stick with the hot crab legs and meat station.

My overall opinion for the variety of food offered was hopeful at first, but disappointed as I walked around to scope things out. It does have your customary dessert area, asian area, mexican area, salad area, a tandoor area, and carving area. At one point I saw Area 51, but that was the only thing out of this world here unfortunately!

The food itself missed many marks as it was to the point where I only had 1 plate and refused to go back for anything further..I tried a vegetable egg roll, pineapple sausage,  and orange chicken from the Asian station. I did find the egg roll to be cooked quite well and not too crispy like it was swimming in a day pool of grease. The orange chicken was hit or miss piece to piece. I had some that were soft and flavorful and a majority that well were more geared towards being a jawbreaker than a delight of the orient.

My highlight of the meal was the prime rib from the carving station, but that didn't totally ""meat"" the mark (pardon the pun)..The gentleman who manned the station was very pleasant and did seem to take to me being respectful as a rarity which made me wonder how people are normally..I give kudos to him and certainly people deserve to be treated as equals..THAT could be a whole other review in itself..The prime rib itself was very tender, BUT it did lack quite a bit of flavor..I drenched it in au jus, but still some bold flavor would've been appreciated

Another notable was the peel and eat shrimp and steamed snow crab..The shrimp itself was a high point and I did enjoy that the crab was cut in half so that you could just essentially skin the crab for the meat vs. getting carpal tunnel cracking all day..I probably could've eaten much more of that and from looking around it did seem like these were a crowd pleaser of patrons above anything else.

I have to say in closing this was a let down for me as there are clearly better and well accepted buffets in Vegas (seems like a dying breed of what once was), but I really hope that Aria takes notice and conducts a serious revamp of things in the near future..The staff was warm and inviting which is a saving grace, but an empty dining room during the pre Zarkana hours does kind of paint a very disturbing picture right?",2,2,2

The buffet at Aria actually made me want to write me first review ever! My friend and I happened to get there at brunch and that couldn't have been better timing! FIRST of all, this place was immaculate. Everything was really clean, which I love, obviously. I love food, but I'm not really a buffet person because they have kind of a grimy vibe to me. Aria was completely different. 

So brunch consisted of an omelette station, fresh biscuits and gravy, eggs, bacon, sausage etc. DO not skip the waffles they are HEAVENLY. I was determined to do a buffet right this time and try everything but I stuffed myself with three or four of those babies. They also have crablegs for DAYS which I also went back to a few times. I've never eaten so much crab on my life. It tasted so fresh. Another thing I never do is eat sushi at a buffet but given the clean environment I went for it. Delicious! They did not disappoint. They also have Chinese food which was absolutely fantastic and not super greasy. They had these huge cuts of BBQ'd pork, tri-tip, all different cuts and flavors of meat and they're steaming hot and savory. I still salivate at the thought hah. Another thing I really liked is that they have some Indian curries and chickpea marsala that was incredible. The dessert bar is to die for. They have many desserts to chose from and they are all delightful.

Grilled jumbo shrimp and scallop on the half shell: I didn't like how you have to wait in line to be served one serving. It's not like it was custom made or anything. For them to not just ""put it out there"" makes them look stingy. 

Bone-in prime rib: They won't serve you the cut near the bone or even the the rib itself until after a certain time, like 6 or 7 pm. What's that about?!

Sashimi: I think they had this, or at least it was on display, but it was hard to figure out how to get it.

The breakfast buffet offered a lot with the options of fresh eggs, already cooked eggs, bacon, waffles, etc. The Asian station at the buffet had dim sum available along with some rice and beef with broccoli. The Italian station provided you with a variety of pizza and the carving station had chicken and steak available. While I felt this was to accommodate the international visitors, I wasn't sure whether the food was kept out until the buffet served at night and was just re-steamed. 

I wasn't crazy about the buffet for breakfast or for dinner. The French toast sticks were very hard and some of the breakfast potatoes Weren't cooked all the way through. The coffee, however, was very smooth and tasted amazing. 

although I'd like to give this place a 5 star, I can't because of the lack of variety in their food and the quality of some of their food. The carving station had steaks but we're either cooked medium rare or overly cooked to where it was just chewy.

Stations were distinctly set apart to separate genres of food, such as Indian, American, Asian, etc. The newness of the buffet is comforting. Unfortunately, I got the overall impression that the food did not quite compare to the decor and vibe of the restaurant. Not that there was anything faulty with the food, but it simply did not leave a lasting impression as one would expect from The Buffet at Aria.

The layout seems smaller and more compact than at some buffets which means I think they slightly less variety of food options, but what they do offer was top notch. The carving station BBQ pork shoulder was excellent and the brisket was good as well but a little fatty. I really enjoyed the Mexican fajita bar, with the barbacoa being one of the most tasty buffet meats I've enjoyed in quite a while. If you enjoy like I do you'll like their seafood station. They feature king and snow crab legs which are served hot and cold and were tasty and fresh without being stringy. One older guy who was sucking down crab legs when we arrived and still going strong as we left so he apparently approved of them. The chilled shrimp cocktail shrimp were tasty and the scampi had one of the largest shrimp I've seen anywhere. The desserts were tasty and featured an enjoyable pecan pie and large ice cream selection among other items.

This buffet is a little lacking in selection compared to some others but I enjoyed everything and will return. I'd say this is a 4 star buffet if you like seafood and 3 starts if you're not a fan. With the 2 for 1 special through My Vegas this was an even better deal!",3,0,0

My favorite buffet is probably Le Village Buffet at Paris and Aria's buffet came pretty close.  The decor is clean and simple, they have nice lights hanging from the ceiling that reminded me of floating glass candles or something.  If you get seated by the windows, you can see the hotel pool.  This buffet was also not as crowded as more of the popular ones (like Paris, MGM, and Wynn).

It took a while for our waitress to come and take our drink orders, but she was pretty thorough with clearing our plates as we ate.  We came just in time for lunch pricing and right before dinner started.  Unlike most buffets, they had crab legs available during lunch so we didn't need to wait for them to be brought out.  They also had a nice quantity compared to other buffets and the crab was really sweet, I loved it.  They had a good variety of food - from what I can recall they had crab, shrimp, sushi, salmon salad, sandwiches, pizza, made-to-order pasta, roast beef, prime rib, fried chicken, corn cobs, mashed potatoes, Mexican food, and Asian food.  I really liked most of the food that I got and the servers were nice.

I am all about desserts when it comes to buffets and I was excited to try Aria's.  Unfortunately, I wasn't too impressed.  A lot of the desserts had nuts in them, which I don't like.  Their sugar-free chocolate cake was really good though and so was their strawberry gelato.  I was hoping for a larger variety of desserts to choose from but the selection seemed small.  I'd probably recommend this for a lunch buffet stop, I didn't really notice any new dishes being brought out for dinner so you don't really need to pay the difference in price.

I came here Saturday evening around 6pm and paid for the gourmet dinner ($39.99 plus tax). So, oh so many options...from the split crab legs to the mini pizzas...freshly carved brisket to the freshly made pasta selections...let's just say the best thing about the buffet is that no matter how much food you think you have on a plate, there will be someone that will have more.

I mostly gravitated towards to the seafood but some of my other faves were on the dessert section...the mini triple chocolate cake pops and mocha flavored cupcakes were stand outs for me. They also had several varieties of pies and several flavors of ice cream\/gelato available.

I came here during the Memorial Day weekend and there was a premium price ($38.99) for lunch. After tax and tip, we were $100 in ($50.00 per person). It's slightly cheaper on non busy time (non holiday) so I guess you get more value then.

The food was just okay. The Flan tasted like it was bad (I never spit out food but this was my first time). The egg Benedict was cold and didn't taste very pleasing. The selection is small, and you don't really see this before you get in. We were very hungry and jumped at the first thing that didn't have a very long line--now I can see why. There is better out there (eg. we will be going to Caesar's for better buffet tomorrow and their price is comparable to this but with much better food.

We only liked the sausage and Mexican rice. Their sweets section is largely good. But the other food was just bad. I'm giving this three stars because it could have been worse.

Now it is a sad imitation of the Bachcanal buffet at Ceasars. They have a few different meats at the carving station. They are serving things in their own little cooking containers. Just like the Bacchanal. They even use the same tyoe of music. Yet the food quality and service isn't as good as the Bacchanal.

My wife had a bagel that was hard. Our waitress went on break so our table stopped being served. When I went to get ice cream the server gave it to me. Then remembered he was supposed to be wearing rubber gloves. It didn't replace my ice cream that he used his fingers to help serve, he just went on to the next person. 

The price is not impressive either. We paid $32 each today for brunch. Yesterday we paid the same at the Bacchanal for lunch.

The bad thing about catching a 7am flight to Las Vegas is I'm SO tired. (I'm NOT a morning person!)

The good thing? breakfast buffet at Aria. (maybe I could be a morning person?)

After taking care of hotel stuff, we headed over to the buffet at 10am.  There was a long line of folks waiting to get in, all curious to see what Vegas' newest buffet has to offer. Breakfast buffet is priced at $14.95 (lunch is $30 and starts at 11am)  Despite having an ambiance of a modern day cafeteria, Aria wins extra points for: omelette station made to order, great selection of charcuterie and cheeses, fruit filled crepes (sadly, already pre-made) and a carving station (yes, breakfast!)

Since we timed it right, lunch items were being put out fresh. Mountains of crab legs and shrimp that will tease the eyes and satisfy your taste buds! Definitely the sweetest crab legs I've had in a while. It was nice to see the chef making fresh naan with a traditional oven right in front of you. The Chinese food selection is dismal, the sushi limited and the dessert choices weren't as plentiful as the Wynn Buffet. But the flan has a really pretty presentation and the cream puff with the raspberry sauce perfect. 

Contrary to other yelper's experiences, service was prompt and our server worked hard -- he literally had sweat beads on his forehead from running around.

Aria buffet is a must try especially if you pay the breakfast price and stay for lunch!",27,22,26

SEAFOOD\/ASIAN: Came here for brunch -- and disclaimer: I skipped all of the meat portion, it didn't look appetizing to me. The seafood was amazing! Their alaskan crab was delicious. They had a great variety of mussels too. Their hacau and shumai in the Asian section was delicious! Not too soggy, and the shrimp and other meat were cooked beautifully. Definitely did not taste like buffet Chinese food. 

DESSERT: Their gelato was so rich and creamy. The freezer spins around so you can see all the selections. I loved their cookies & cream. Highly recommend. Their macarons were amazing.

I ate here both for lunch and dinner and while the menus were nearly identical, the food was great both times. Aria served a mix of Indian food, Chinese food, fresh sushi, steamed and cold crab legs, scallops, fish, pork shoulder, prime rib and carved ham and chicken.

I'd still say that Caesar's buffet is still the better of the two, but Aria's at least will not leave you disappointed. There's some standout food items like the dim sum tray and the indian food selection. One sore spot for the buffet would be the lack of fruit choices for brunch- watermelon, cantaloupe, and honeydew shouldn't be the only fruit choices at a high end buffet.

It wasn't super crowded when we got there which kind of worried me.  But since the dining room looked remarkably pretty for a buffet, I decided to hold off judgement until after I taste the food.

First thing I noticed...crab legs.  Pre-cut crab legs!  Less fuss, more yummy!  Points for that for sure!  I initially lined up for an omelette but the line got super long.  So I bypassed it and went with a meat theme. I tried the prime rib, bbq brisket, turkey, and roast pork, all fresh cut for me on demand.  In general, the meat was the star of this brunch today...something I did not expect for a weekend brunch meal.  I did eventually get the omelette later in the meal and it was worth the wait.

I liked how most or all of the buffet items were prepared gluten-free which is a very proud thing to boast.  However, in my attempt to avoid tummy filling carbs, I looked past the different unique flavored cream cheeses and bagels, pancakes, waffles, and wrapped fruit blintzes.  Even the eggs benedict looked tempting as well.

One thing that baffled me were the Asian hot dishes...like noodles and stir fried beef.  I wasn't sure how they fit in with the brunch theme...I didn't see sushi\/sashimi which I would had gladly tried.  The price point of $35 in comparison to the regular weekday breakfast\/lunch is quite steep.

I am usually pretty skeptical about buffets, but wow do I love the higher end variants that appear to be rather sanitary.

Since I am a hefty fellow, I do not take the task of adequately preparing for a buffet lightly.  You have to know what I am talking about when you fill up after eating only two, two and a half heaping plates.  It's very dissapoining.  Think about how much you are leaving on the table (look at me, droppin a pun).

Meanwhile, think about a lighter dinner the night before, and even if you drink, resist the urge of a big 3AM meal.  I did just this, and woke up around 8AM and mentally prepared myself for a 10AM feast.  Meditation, some slots, USA today, perhaps some of you more fit folks might get an early morning workout in (me, not so much, that's just silly talk).  

If you are famished by the time you check in with the cashier for the buffet line, congrats, you have properly prepared for your breakfast.

The service was very good - friendly and attentive.  The food selection is quite overwhelming, with different ethnic stations surely adding to the experience.

While I won't put the experience quite on par with the Wynn buffet, it will absolutly get the job done.  I dont need to list every station, but I think my plates consisted of various concoctions of eggs, belgian waffles, pizza, yogurt parfaits, donuts, Indian naan, latin style eggs and tortillas, gellato, asian dumplings, and all kinds of other fun stuff.  Lots of different seafood offerings as well.

So overall, it's a great comped breakfast, but at thirty something dollars a person, I'd probably consider taking a walk to Denny's if I had to pay for it.  That said, if I was feeling lazy, I'm sure the thirty something dollars is relatively cheap compared to regularly priced restaruants at the hotels.

So go on, grab that special someone, and treat them to the romantic meal of a lifetime.

**Bonus 2** Just to show you how serious I am about my buffet eating:  Upon returning to my table I found my table cleared..I asked the waitress and she apologized and said, that I had finished a few plates and a couple of dessert plates so she thought i was done.  i said it was understandable and put my next round of two plates on the table to continue my meal.  I had such a smile inside, because even for a buffet waitress, who probably has witnessed gluttony like you can't possibly imagine, I somehow baffled her.

We might as well give ourselves the whole Aria experience since we were already staying there for the weekend, had a nice 3am meal at their Cafe Vettro upon arriving and had some of the best desserts at Jean Philippe... might as well start off another great day devouring Aria's buffet. =) 

For the price they charge, and for the experience that people expect from City Center, I expect better. A lot better. The buffet line started off with jumbo shrimp cocktails and king crab legs, what a great first impression. Definitely got me all excited to see what else was waiting for me to devour. However, it was just a continuous let down. The selections they had were mediocre. Only thing that kept my stomach from complaining was their shrimp cocktails. Everything else was just deceiving. Great looking but the taste just wasn't there. 

I have this second stomach for dessert and the presentation of the desserts was quite impressive! So I skipped right to it. I just felt horrible after getting it. I ended up wasting food because more than half of the desserts I got did not even taste good. I just sat there poking them with my sad panda face.

Maybe the creme brulee - but it was a little too sweet and the top could've been a little crunchier. 

Food was not served hot - by the time I start eating my plate they were barely warm. 

Garlic naan was pretty good, but a little greasy. Shrimp and crab legs were okay. They're having a lobster promotion now, but you only get half a lobster and it's pretty small. It didn't taste that great either.

The meat station was pretty good. The usual suspects; Prime Rib, Ham, Roasted Chicken, Smoked Sausage and a Beef Brisket or Roast maybe. They called it Steamship. It was all really good, juicy and tender. We went on Sat night so they also had a Steak Station. The were grilling custom ordered Sirloins. While I usually don't care for a Sirloin, I gave it a try and it was good! Tender, juicy, flavorful and cooked perfectly! 

The salad bar and the vegetable selection was a little lacking but what they had was good. I tried the Mac and Cheese, excellent! For a buffet especially. The Tamales were also very good and tasted fresh made. I'll say this, it's the first buffet I've been to in Las Vegas where everything tastes fresh made. I didn't taste anything that was bland or dried out. 

They also served seafood! Cold Alaskan King Crab, split and oysters and such. Warm sweet Snow Crab, cracked and a few fish dishes and muscles dishes. I only tried the crab but it was delicious! The Snow Crab was super sweet and came out of the shell easily. They come cracked so that helps. The bins were always full, no lines.

And the best part was the dessert!! Let me say again, buffet desserts are usually bland and dry bits of cardboard but this buffet....holy smokes! Every single thing I tried tasted moist, delicious and fresh made. 

I posted pics, check them out. Over all, great meal worth $30 for sure. We'll be back!",5,0,2

The managers name was Geraldine and she was respectful and was kind as well. We told her that we just had an amazing experience ate the Aria Buffet and our waitress, Kelly, was a really pleasant waitress. Kelly, aside from doing her duties, is such a gem to the restaurant. Her personality is exceptional and went past my expectations as a customer.
In a short period of time, Kelly had built a rapport with us and made us feel extra comfortable. We exchanged small talks and we found out that aside from her working full time, she fosters kids,feeds the homeless and cooks for them on top of her medical challenges. 
I hope that one day, she would get some type of help doing what she's doing or get some type of appraisal for her work ethic. She's a perfect example of a dream employee who leaves her personal challenges outside of work and perform very well at work till the last second of her shift.

Their deserts are fabulous too - lots of items in bite size portions so you have the opportunity to try a lot.

1- she yelled at us for slightly moving the table to create some space.

2- we purchase bottomless drinks but it was on a separate receipt so she was giving me a hard time. 

3- after 1 round of drinks for 4 people she said we should go to the bar instead ""you go to bar get your own drinks"" when I clearly see her pick up drink orders for other tables with parties of 4-6 people. And even though our table had 8 people only 4 was drinking so I don't get why she treated us like that. 

4- she timed us. Once the 2 hour mark hit she told us we can no longer drink or eat and our time was up. She even held up the receipt and pointed the 2 hour time limit to myself. I felt so angry because I still had my drink and I want to finish but I felt so uncomfortable so I went up to the bartender to ask if it's true, that we need to leave.... he said no we do not kick our patrons out.

First dinner was on a Monday night.  Awesome thing is they had raw oysters on the half shell (love raw oysters).  The buffet however was dead.  This meant the turnover for the food wasn't that great.  The seafood stews had shriveled up shrimps and clams from sitting out too long.  Even the cheese tasted bad like it's been there since lunch.  The piece of blue cheese I had was hard for a soft cheese.  Dried up!  So I stuck to an oyster and crab leg dinner this night.  I had also tried the corn on the cob but the corn was so extremely mushy and gross with the caked on mayo I couldn't eat it.  

We came again for dinner and I guess because it was a Thursday before Xmas week there were a lot more people at the buffet which meant the food was a lot fresher.  The crab, crawfish, mussels and seafood stews were really good.  But no oysters.  That was a disappointment.  I asked the seafood chef and was told oysters are only served on weekends but any leftovers are served Monday nights.  

The Aria dinner buffet is I think $1-2 more than the Bellagio buffet.  If that's the case, Bellagio is much much better.  Fresh food and tastier.  I will complete a review on that buffet as well.  

When we came for lunch the menu looked identical to the dinner menu.  We came during CES week so turnover was high and everything was fresh.  With the same buffet menu for lunch and dinner (incl crab legs) lunch is obv better value.  

Before you eat just see how busy the buffet is first.  Higher turnover means fresher food.",0,0,0

Despite declaring that some 5 of us were senior citizens and four locals, We were pleasantly surprised our bill came to less than $300 including tax and required tip.

It took a while for the servers to prepare a table for nine closer to the food service area. A female at table next to us was throwing up (perhaps, too much drinking) so we asked to move elsewhere. When the rest of our party arrived, we were all seated comfortably, hungry and ready to eat. Ruby was our server. She and the rest of crew were kind, polite and attentive. BEST OF ALL, THE FOOD SELECTION WAS AS GOOD AS CAN BE from several food stations:
The stations within The Buffet include:

Fish Market: Seafood, unlimited Crab Legs, Fish & Chips

Asian: Dim Sum, Chinese, Japanese and Thai dishes

Italian: Pasta, Cured Meats, Cheeses & Mozzarella

Wicked Spoon at the Cosmo

The Buffet at the Wynn

Studio B at the M

are the top 3 in my book. Now Aria isn't a bad buffet place great service nice selection of foods. But I wouldn't really consider anything very gourmet here. All the food are staple foods the cocktail shrimp are not the highest grade compared to the above 3 but it's better than your hosh posh mix of janky buffets. The nice thing about the Aria that I did enjoy was that after the nice meal the walk around the mall next door was perfect to walk it off sorta speak.

The desserts in here as well were a-ok but nothing spectacular compared to the above 3. I got comped 2 buffets for staying at the signature so it wasn't really terrible considering I didn't pay. It's the same price nearly as the other buffets as well so consider this before actually making it out here.

If I'm near here I guess I'd hit this up since it's not terrible and meets the standard of buffets in Vegas!",2,0,0

The ""Indian"" section consisted of some naan and 3-4 different types of curries. The dishes lacked even a hint of the spicy fragrances that Indian dishes are known for. The ""Chinese"" section had some steaming baskets filled with ""dimsum,"" but the wrappers and dough were all mushy and unappealing. 

The meat carving area offered a large variety of meats, including turkey, beef, and barbeque brisket. The brisket was dry and tasteless, even though we were there at just past 11AM. I shudder to think of what it tasted like at noon. Although we were there for lunch, they had a lot of breakfast options left, including cereal (Why?? I'm not paying $40 for cereal), bagels, waffles, french toast, and a custom omelet counter. 

The desserts were lackluster and unimaginative. They had typical desserts you'd find in any normal buffet outside of Las Vegas, like chocolate cupcakes and plain cheesecake. 

Service was mediocre, too. Our server took away my mom's bowl of soup that was still over halfway full without asking if she was done with it, and it took 3 requests until she brought us 2 (for the 4 of us) crab crackers. She was pretty much absent through much of the meal and we always had empty plates piled up on our table.

Came here on a Sunday night and they were way understaffed. People were confused as to where to sit and the hostesses didn't know which tables were open. Out drinks weren't refilled as the poor waitresses was running around trying to take too many tables on. 

Food: It is allright. You obviously can't compare it to the Bellagio or the Wynn but it's decent. The garlic naan was SO GOOD! It has to be good since it was actually made in those cool stone clay pans and made fresh right on the spot. The shrimp is very large and fresh. The crab labs weren't bad. 

Dessert: Ok well you know it has to be good since it was designed by Pastry Champion Jean-Philippe Maury. I literally tried everything! Not too sweet and not too decadent.

It showed a picture of Alaskan King Crab and shows breakfast for $15, lunch for $20 and dinner for $28.  

So we take a taxi to the hotel and by the time we get there, it was late morning.  Low and behold they charged us $25 each for BRUNCH.  We didn't think much about it until after I sat down and started eating.  I then remembered that they advertised Alaskan King Crab and that was one of the main reasons why I wanted to eat here.  When I approached the buffet line, they had SNOW CRAB LEGS-which is a anorexic, cheap version and very different.  I looked at the receipt and noticed that we not only were overcharged, but they falsely advertised their shit.  Not only did they charge us MORE for brunch than breakfast, even lunch, but they didn't have what they advertised at all.

I approached the manager and her response was that the Alaskan King Crab is for dinner only.  Look at the ad I uploaded and you tell me if it says that.  HELL NO.  I asked her to show me where the fuck it says that the crab is ""during dinner only"".  She said, ""Oh, I'll talk to marketing about that"".  Are you freaking kidding me?  I'm not falling for that BS line.  Not only that, but why is her brunch prices higher than lunch?  She couldn't answer.  She then said, ""Well, let me check with the chefs in the back and see if we have any Alaskan King Crab.  Uh...that's great, but I'm actually DONE eating and it's more about the issue more than anything now.  She brought me a plate of the crab legs, but I wasn't into it anymore.  I didn't like how she tried to pull the sheets over my eyes and mislead me, along with all the other people that didn't bother speaking up.  As a compromise, she refunded me 1 meal ($25).  I was satisfied, but wonder how many other people caught this.  

The food was good, not spectacular.  One of my favorites was the thick-cut smoked bacon.  The pre-made breakfast burrito was yummy as well.  Oh...the absolute BEST thing they had was (drum roll) the COFFEE!  OMG...it was the absolute best coffee I've ever had in Vegas.  Starbucks\/Peets can't touch this stuff.  The only other time I had coffee like this was in Portland Oregon in a coffee house there.

My partner and I have dined here on several dozen occasions over the past 2+ years, and we've seen it slowly go downhill. We are MLife Platinum members and frequent the Aria Casino regularly. Recently, it's been just hit-or-miss.

What a disappointment on Easter Sunday dinner at 7:30pm, when they do an extra surcharge at $47.99 per person, plus tax. I was expecting they could do a little better on a ""holiday"".
Foremost in our minds was the decision to remove the made-to-order pasta station, which my partner enjoyed on almost every occasion previously. Now, in its place, there's just a lonely Pho station, which does not look appetizing and from which no one orders. It's confusing what exactly it even is.

The deli meats used to include high end selections- delicious salami and prosciutto. Now, it looks like thin slices of turkey, ham, and roast beef. They have even cut down on the cheese selection, no longer serving mozzarella, dried apricots, various nuts, or the flatbreads and breadsticks which used to accompany the spread on a daily basis.

The carving station used to have roasted vegetables- carrots, onion, purple cauliflower, butternut squash, and zucchini. This time-ONLY yellow zucchini. 

In addition, some of our favorite classic selections have been ruined--Mac and Cheese is now Lobster Mac and cheese, Plain vegetable fried rice is now Shrimp fried rice. Not for vegetarians...

The Aria Buffet used to be amazing- a great and vast selection of food. I used to rave about it and recommend it left and right.
We loved the Raspberry and Apricot Rugelach from the dessert station, which is unfortunately never served anymore.

Also, during our most recent visit, my partner went to the dessert station for a chocolate chip cookie. He returned for another one and saw an employee taking about 10 remaining cookies and packing them up. If there's only ten left, why not allow customers to finish them? Very perplexing.

My partner actually left hungry because he couldn't find anything appetizing. At $200 for a party of four, we truly felt we did not get our money's worth, and do not plan on returning any time in the near future.",0,0,0

This trip however was with a first timer friend and we went for a mid week lunch. 

There were expectingly no line at all at the cashier, very friendly, helpful ladies. There were a buy one get one bottomless drink offer going on so we took advantage of that plus I had a 2 for 1 voucher for the buffet as well. So price wise it was unbeatable for us at least.

What I loved the most about the Buffet? It felt spacious and the pool view and extra light was a bonus. The food variety was acceptable. Enough options that anyone can find at least few favorites to go back to. Mine was the mushroom cheese pizza and dolma. The Mediterranean section in general was my favorite. 

Just had an issues with our server, it felt like he was deliberately avoiding to notice us! Had to flag him down every time we needed something. Before we leave asked for a beer refill and he rather aggressively ordered me to show him my receipt. He took it and came back with my beer (that was my 3rd glass, not that it matters) . And told me again with a very aggressive tone that this is your last drink you can't get anymore! We were done anyways and were almost about to leave but I asked why is that? And he told  me ""there is a 2 hour limit no more drinks!"" 
It's not a big deal I'm sure he was having a bad day or something, and I calmly told him first of all if I want more drinks I will get more drinks and second, we were there for exactly 1 hour 10 minutes! So this was a little bit odd. 

Bottomline this was a solid 3.5 star experience. To be honest , I would rather go to wicked spoon next door at Cosmo or buffet at Wynn if I have to pay the full price.

The desserts are okay if you like them American-style.

What stood out the most were the dumplings. There was plenty of stuffing inside! You don't get that often, since they usually try to minimize the stuffing to keep costs down.

The sticky rice was also good.

Bottom line is, if you're okay with just snow crab legs but want the best meat, go to Le Village Buffet in Paris. If you want to have a variety of crab legs, curry, and Asian food, it is better to go here.

This is why I gave it at least 2 stars.  If the service was poor, I would have given none (1).  So why the poor rating? THE FOOD!  They pride themselves on all you can eat crab legs.  And they had both hot and cold to select from.  I tried both.  Both were very dry and little on the meat.  The legs are cut length wise down the middle, so you get one really thin side of meat to eat, which takes a lot of work to get a small dry and flaky reward.  They have several stations to sample different parts of styles; Asian, Mediterranean, American, Mexican and a couple others.  The Asian sucked.  Noodles were bland and the Korean ribs fat and greasy.  The Prime rib (which was actually Ribeye roast, not Prime) was dark throughout.  There is a cold cut section which was tasty, but all the cheeses next to it were cubed.  So if you wanted to make a little sandwich, you were out of luck.  I tried a pepperoni pizza bagel and waited until a fresh one came out of the oven.  When I got back to my table to eat, it was soggy in the middle, disgusting.  I tried a few other things and overall wasn't impressed.  The dessert section had a lot of variety and I sampled several items.  All were pretty good, except for a lollipop cake.  It was gross.

All four of us had high hopes for this buffet.  The Aria hotel is super nice and has an upscale look inside and out.  So to pay $35 and for this meal was a huge let down.  I'm not trying to be overly critical, just accurate.  Trying the one at Caesar's next... I hear it is amazing.  Hopefully I will remember to post a review",1,0,0

- Blatantly Bad

Even for a buffet, this crew was just obnoxious.  

* Establishment
- Ordinary

It's a buffet.  It feels like a buffet.  It looks like a buffet. Nothing worth mentioning here.  

* Service
- Ordinary

Our server was prompt, friendly and attentive.   

* Food Quantity \/ Quality \/ Presentation
- Somewhat Encouraging (it's a buffet!)

I don't know should I write a review of buffet food or tell you how the food was at this buffet?  Ok I'll do both...

Buffet food: Ambitious!  They are innovative and are trying to do cool things!  Exotic(ish) entrees appear throughout the sectioned-off buffet and new ideas seem to be welcome here as they have small bites and cool combinations available.  For example...

A charcuterie section was a good try.  Tillamook cheddar and cheap lunchmeat slices made it a miss.  

Small bites glasses full of various salads was a cool idea.  I tried Thai beef and it was just ok.  (A piece of cheap roast-beef lunchmeat in a glass with some dressing and greens.)

Stunning (looking) desserts will please the eye but disappoint the taste buds (IMHO.) 

The food if it were not a buffet:  No good!  For the novelty of a buffet, variety and quantity, this place is your spot.  For good food you need to find another dining experience elsewhere.  

* What I'll remember

- The Mecca of glistening desserts - I SO WISH my mouth's experience matched my eyes'!

What I can't wait to forget

The dried out brisket.  The sawdust rice.  The decaying Shu Mai.  The velveeta Mac and cheese.",3,1,1

Some of the points mentioned by the other reviewers while true, don't equate to a 1 or 2 star rating.  Yes, the shrimp was located a long way from the crab legs, the Asian items at this buffet are not the greatest, etc.  buth this place serves quality food.

I found the atmosphere to be dependent on where you are sitting.  The middle area is most pleasant with the dimmed lighting.  Sitting on some of the edges may make the place seem more cafeteria like.

The Food:  I ate the weeked gourmet buffet (which costs a bit more).  They had rack of lamb, leg of lamb, sucking pig, and many more great tasting  rare items.  Even the taste and quality of the none entree items (rice, potatoes etc.) was high.  The deserts here are exceptional.  They are exquisitely prepared on small desert trays.  I tried 5-6 different items, and they were all excellent.  They also had some gelato although the selection was not as great as at the Rio seafood buffet.  

I'm only giving this four stars because I have not tried  the Bellagio.  I'd say the overall quality, value, and taste is  a bit higher than the Mandalay Bay buffet (which is also very good).

I returned to the weekend dinner buffet in January 2011.  The prices seem a bit higher, but they now give you half a lobster ($5 extra for a whole lobster) and house wines with your dinner.  The various entrees and side dishes (great garlic naan) are still excellent as was the service.  The desert selections were not as large as when they first opened.",1,0,0

Is it knock your socks off? Absolutely not. But for $20 for breakfast and $24 for lunch it is a good value.
What did I like?
They will toss your salad and it is good choices. This won me over.
The smoked salmon (lox) was pretty good quality.
The fresh fruit was decent.
The roasted beets for lunch were delicious.

Buffets and Smoke filled casinos and the newest is Aria.  So of course we had to at least try it right?  

$19.99 for lunch. Ok it's new and bright and all pretty looking, but at 1pm the place was only about 1\/2 filled. Strange for the newest buffet on the strip.  

Onto the food. Salty. Bland. Salty. Bland. Salty. I couldn't even finish the piece of prime rib cause it was way too salty...plus the whole thing was cooked to what looked like medium-well and by the time they cut the piece off, the little bit of pink disappeared and it was a nice well done. blah.  I had to laugh at the chinese bbq pork...they had a carver cutting little pieces for people. Really? 

The only thing I enjoyed was the hot & sour soup. Cause it had flavor and wasn't salty.  Saving grace for bad buffets is usually dessert. Not here. Again. No flavor in anything. Oh and most of the desserts are served on these pretty plates that are really bulky so you can carry maybe three of them at the most if you stack them right. It's a buffet for crying out loud, I want to be able to load up a plate will 20 desserts to sample :o)

Ok maybe I'm being harsh. I mean I did stay out until 5:30am drinking so maybe my taste buds were dead or something.  Of our group of 7, three thought the food was good. But they were eating things like chow mein and pizza and chicken.

Food was okay do not under any circumstances order the ramen soup at the Asian station it tastes like it was made from the same ramen college students eat. It was watered down to boot. So foul. My slice of prime rib was blue which is not my preference. The ribs were good though as were the deserts I tried except the flan which tasted like egg and the creme br√ªl√©e which was sloppy.

It's about $5 for a small cup of gelato outside, but you can get unlimited amounts in the buffet. Three scoops is already about $15! The sushi selections are meh.. not too great. Basically Asian food is not gonna be that great. The pizza was tasted alright though! 

The service is pretty nice. I had a few problems with my server this weekend though. I asked for OJ, and she forgot. I asked her again and she gave me grapefruit juice. It was bitter, but that's sort of expected since its fresh. I asked her for a coffee and she forgot again. Personally, I think she was attending too many tables that she forgets what people ask her for. So -1 star for that.

Personally I would give this a 3star rating for the price\/quality ratio but it's Vegas. It's hard to find great cheap food that you would normally find in LA. I've tried many buffets in the city, but this one seems to stand out from the rest.",0,0,0

The $19.99 weekday lunch buffet at the Aria was my favorite buffet in Vegas, ever.  Yes, somehow the wifey and I ended up in Vegas, again, after my bro.i.l.'s (ie my wife's brother, not the husband of my sister) wedding in SoCal.  We stayed at the Aria and ate at the lunch buffet on a whim and because we didn't feel like walking around in 100+ degree weather outside (38C for all you metric people).   

King Crab legs, prime rib, pasta and omelette stations, sushi (rolls and a few pieces of nigiri), desserts by Jean Phillipe, and more- FOR LUNCH.  But the station that put this buffet experience over the top was the Chinese station.  Yes, believe it or not, the Chinese food station at Aria's buffet was excellent.  So fresh, not salty, no taste\/aftertaste of madison square garden, and not too oily.  The best Chinese I've had at a buffet- bar none.

Not sure it was worth 32.95 per person but that's the comparable rate for brunch buffets. For an extra $6, you can add bottomless mimosas or bloody mary's to your brunch.

There is something for everyone here. There are even delicious roasted on the grill veggies at the carving station. Chips and dip. Little mini salads. Many foods from around the world.

Like most buffets, it is not super amazing. Like the Naan bread was heavy. The dim-sum taste was mediocre at best. I wished they had a steamed pork bun and they didn't have it. The tandoori chicken was adequate. 

The desert section was great. I should have saved more room for this. I wanted to try them all. I almost did but not the pink meringue which supposedly was do die for. The gelato was great and I tried 5 flavors. I wish I had some of the apple pie. Bread pudding isn't my thing so no for that.

My expectations of this place from last time were average so I was hoping that it was gonna be better. Far from it.

I was hoping to have a decent dinner experience since my last buffet trip at Bacchanal last year was really disappointing.

Where do I begin? Almost all the food I tried tonight really missed their mark. Cold crab legs were salty. Hot ones were ok when my parents brought some but when I went they were barely warm then became cold real quick. Sushi was terrible. Korean short ribs were burnt and had lots of fat on it. Pork ribs had decent flavor but was tough to eat. Pizza was awful and I usually don't have any problems with buffet pizza but the pepperoni slice was off. The only thing I tried from the Asian section was the sesame seed balls with red bean inside and those were tough to eat.

The only decent things I had here tonight were the shrimp and grits and mac & cheese.

But what gets me is the lack of variety in some of the sections. Mediterranean, Italian and Indian sections were poor with selections.

The saving point was the dessert. The rotating ice cream flavors tonight were a huge letdown. Not all the containers were used and some were repeats like vanilla. Dessert section was poor as well.

Service was not that great since our server took a while to get our drinks. And they still use the same tiny glasses.

Overall this trip was a letdown. Doubt I'll eat here again even if it's comped.",0,0,0

The buffet offered selections from hand tossed salads, various types of breads and cheeses, fresh seafood, and different types of meat cooked in every way possible. It's really hard to describe the whole dining experience in detail because of the overwhelming choices at this buffet but one thing I can say is that Aria did not spare on the quality of ingredients.

Highlights of the Meal:
Diner- Mac and Cheese with Truffles and the Grilled Cheese with Tomato Bisque
Seafood- Alaskan King Crab Legs
Poultry: BBQ Braised Pork 
Dessert: Lemon Bar and the Gelato!

Quite pricey compared to usual buffets at $45 per person for dinner but the two complementary meals for hotel guests make the bill a bit more reasonable. 

Also, if you're planning to come here for dinner I suggest you wait until around 6pm so that the leftovers from the lunch menu are already replaced by freshly cooked ones.

However they broke my #1 rule of rules.  One rule to rule them all! Keep my cup full.  Since we are not permitted to fill our own cups like we are at some buffets, this left me rather thirsty for most of the meal, which sucks.

To be fair though, the server did recognize the issue after 30 minutes or so and apologized profusely for forgetting me. It was probably my fault anyways, messing up her groove by requesting a move to another table.

BTW, buffet decor, great! I love the modern, artsy feel to the place.  Plenty of good food and presentation was good. Didn't see any stations go near empty.

Boy, were we wrong. OK, know it's only their second day in operation, but how can you screw up bacon and eggs? My wife and I were shown our table, and immediately went to get our food. The food area was quite long, but not a great selection. Usually I walk and look at the food and figure out the few things that look best so I can fit them onto my plate, but here, it was a struggle to find enough things appealing enough to eat. Their eggs benedict looked very weird; the eggs were freakishly white. Hard to find just regular breakfast fare. There were two omelet stations with many people waiting at each ( you know a buffet is bad when people opt for the 'ol standby omelet) I got in line behind Mr. Picky who had to have a special egg white only omelet with veeeery light Cheddar cheese and was also behind some punk kid who was eating off his plate in line. Idiot. The chef manning the station seemed overwhelmed by the special order so I moved on. A huge slice of ham (not bad), some Chinese egg concoction and a slice of pizza later I went back to eat. Started eating and no server yet. Half way through and still no server. Finally when I was almost done, a server asked if I wanted anything to drink. I barely chocked out, ""orange juice"". Finally, when I was on my second to last bite, my drink came, all six ounces of it. I asked for two more. 
For 15 bucks, this should have been much better. I have gotten just a good breakfast at Terribles for half the price. Also, since this place should be one of the elite, what I found totally tacky was at each of the foods, instead of having a nice plaque with what the food is, it was written on the sneeze windows with grease pencil.

The layout and design of the restaurant give it a high class vibe. The general food and quality was very similar to Bellagio with more of a focus on Indian food. They have fresh made naan which was quite delicious.

Theres the standard crab legs and shrimp, but for some reason the weekend I went it had unpeeled shrimp and the crab legs were smaller then I remembered seeing before. They also gave half a lobster to each guest after you sat down, but you were not allowed to have refills on the lobster. Lobster was very delicious.

I mainly enjoyed the carved meats. They had a lot of options such as brisket, prime rib, pork ribs, beef ribs, skirt steak, mahi mahi, etc. I of which we very good. The chinese food and sushi was okay, but not real memorable. I didnt try the pastas, they had a pasta station, but didnt use it.

The desert area is sorta hit or miss. I didnt like it, but I know others who have liked it. Its more of a crap shoot on whether or not the stuff they had was the stuff you liked.

They make the kind of pasta you want. The drinks (soda, raspberry tea, etc) are for FREE (well, with your meal, but free refills!.

Our hotel stay at the Aria gave us access to the The Buffet daily during our stay. I'm thinking, I have dinner plans, why would I come to an AYCE buffet? Our first day was a travel day and we had no dinner plans. We decided to hit up the The Buffet at ARIA. 

We walk up to the register and ask for a table, no reservation needed. Once we're settled and place our drink order, now its on. I walk around the entire facility and scan each station very carefully. My wife starts making a salad. That's great. I come back with a hunk of prime rib with a dash of horseradish as well as a kielbasa link.

That's it. (For the first plate)

My wife pushes her salad to the side. Ooooh! That looks good, can I taste? Sure! What's that, I tell her horseradish and she dips in. Now she's abandoned the salad and ran over to the carving station. 

After the meats, we hit up the crab legs. I don't like to get too crazy with crab legs, its a lot of work for little yield. They were pretty good regardless. There are many great items, from the Tandoori Chicken to the Italian station, The Buffet at ARIA has dinner down pat.

I was so full, I skipped breakfast the next day! The following day? Back to The Buffet at ARIA but this time for Breakfast. Fresh Salmon and cream cheese is how I started this buffet. Next, they make a Huuuuuuuuuuge pancake that is cooked perfectly. They cut off a square and serve it to the guests. Pretty ingenuous Aria. Then I had Eggs Benedict, a yogurt parfait and some coffee. I'm feeling pretty good! My wife had an egg white omelet with a bunch of healthy stuff mixed in. We both left stuffed but more importantly, the food being served was high quality. I didn't see any brown gravy with the skin on it. Everything was fresh and tasted great.

My second grouse....food labeling....it is terrible! They have food sections and in a particular food section there will be a plaque telling you all the dishes that are available there. The problem is sometimes I don't know what dish is what....how about putting the label in front of the particular dish!!! Ain't that a brilliant idea!! Example....I picked up a type of salad thinking it was a potato salad....nope turned out it was tuna salad....now if they had just put the label in front of each dish...would have made my life much easier! 

Also I am not vegetarian but I noticed that the labeling made it very hard to tell, which dish was vegetarian or not. Example, it says vegetable fried rice....but its full of pork and beef...fabulous Aria!! You just ruined some poor vegetarian's day!!

My third grouse....food taste...overall not impressed. Yes I know its a buffet and I should not expect Michelin star rated food and to be honest I am not. But I do expect there to be flavor in the dishes and for them to taste different! I tried almost everything they had there and the best thing was the ""vegetable fried rice"" and the Parmesan bread....all of which I don't need to pay $25 bucks for!

My last grouse....variety....Las Vegas buffets are famous for their lavish spreads and variety in food. I felt a distinct lack of ""lavishness"" here. If you are going to do less than you had better make sure that the quality of the food is high. Unfortunately, Aria fails in both the variety and the taste department!

The servers were nice and the dessert bar was decent...but that's about it. So if you're looking for a Vegas buffet, don't come here, save your time, money and energy and walk yourself over to the Bellagio or Wynn yes it costs more but at least you leave feeling full, satisfied and happy!",2,3,0

With that, I surmise that its open floor-plan buffet dining room is aptly designed, resembling a mid-sized Silicon Valley tech company cafeteria or a strip mall's Todai.  This is not a compliment.

The food here mirrors the aesthetic; nothing stands out.  Everything is rigidly assembled without any artful flair similar to lesser off-strip buffets.  The seafood and meat selections here are dry, while the salad bar is just average.  This is made exponentially worse by the fact that the buffet items are limited.  

The stand-out section, however, is their dessert bar and gelato.  Though half of the pickings here are highly flawed to inedible, the other half may satisfy your sweet tooth to some extent.

 I loved the curry chicken ! Really really good, flavor was perfect along with the Nann and Biryan rice

They have all types of food from the seafood section to like a wheel of fortune ice-crew, the sliced beef was so juicy as well and always ask for an extra slice.

I honestly can't comment on the price, as a friend paid for the dinner.

I was very impressed with the cleanliness of the place.  It was bright, and open, and very appealing.  

The server was polite when taking drink orders and clearing plates.

The selection was very impressive.  Curries, sushi, pizza, meats, and LOTS of seafood.

The quality of the food was standard buffet quality, except for the seafood.  I really didn't care for any of it.  The mahi mahi was cold...not even lukewarm, but cold.  The New Zealand mussels were chewy, and the seafood jambalaya was REALLY fishy.

I was very impressed with the fact that they have so many gluten free options.  Everything is well labeled, so there really isn't much guesswork.

My favorites of the night were the salad, the risotto, all the food at the Tandoori station (curries, etc), the chicken pot stickers, and the mac n cheese.
Now, I have to tell you..the pasta was WAY overcooked and it was kind of mushy, but that's how I like my ""comfort food"" style mac n cheese.  I actually went back for seconds.  

The desert station was huge, and beautiful.  I only had room for a bite or two of cheesecake but that was good too.

As far as Vegas buffets, and I've been to ALOT of them, this ranks very high IMO for quality.  The price reflects that ($37), its about as expensive as they get.  But if you get comped, or a 2-for-1, or MyVegas reward then yeehaw, score!

I thought the asian stir fry dishes, compared to other buffets, were outstanding.  Ingredients like wood ear and gai lan, and several dim sum.  The hot\/sour soup was right on.  If you want REALLY good asian food then get your butt down to Spring Mountain Road, otherwise, its decent.

Some may say you 'cant screw up crab' but I disagree.  You surely can.  Go try the Paradise Seafood buffet and let me know, assuming you survive.  Aria serves whole legs (instead of ruining the meat by slicing them in half), and the legs were fairly meaty.  Theyre tasty.  And I had a bunch. I piled on a bunch of steamed clams and a few mussels.

The Prime Rib was fantastic.  Medium rare and tender.

Salad bar - check, good, lots of decisions to make.  

I'll admit I passed on the Indian fare and the pasta.  I filled up with crab and prime rib :)

Our server, from Nigeria, was friendly and attentive, took good care of our drink needs.  Coffee nice and strong.

While other reviewers poo-poo the dessert array, I thought it was one of the best I've seen at a Vegas buffet, reminded me of the old Palatium Buffet at Caesars.  EVERYTHING i tried was delicious.  Burnt cream, cheese cake, black forest cake, a scrumptious white choc chip cookie, coconut ice cream (or was it gelato? I dont know).  

The clientele here, generally well dressed - so I wouldnt show up in gym shorts\/t-shirts.

They had this ice cream wheel, yes I know let me explain! Think wheel of fortune but with flavors. Pick your flavor and the lady scooping will spin the wheel until it comes to your ice cream. They also had mini cupcakes, whoppie pies, cake pops, and the regular stuff like cakes and cookies.

This buffet is pretty big and has a wide variety of foods (Asian, Mediterranean, Carvery, Mexican, Italian, etc.). There is also a tiny section categorized as a Children's Table. 

The Carvery section has lamb chops!! Other buffets at this price usually just have 2-3 types of meat to offer. They sometimes only give you 2 pieces at a time though, depending on how busy they are.

They have a large section for their seafood - sushi, baked seafood, shrimp, mussels, etc. The crab legs taste amazing and the cold crab legs are usually already broken in half so it's easy to get the meat. Unfortunately, the crawfish wasn't that good and didn't taste fresh. I have yet to find a buffet in Vegas that has quality oysters - this buffet is a hit or miss with their oysters. Tonight, it was a miss.

If you're going to make your own pho, definitely take advantage of the extra toppings that they have right next to it. The broth is very bland.

I am also not the type of person that can eat enough to make the price of a buffet worth while.  Despite this, my husband and I ate at the Aria buffet when we stayed with them a few years ago and it has been the only time I've felt like the food was worth the price of admission, so to speak. I returned to the Aria again, in fact I'm still here, and I visited the buffet again today for lunch around 2pm (they close for lunch at 3pm although they were still seating people around that time). I do not know why it has such a low rating, but I can only assume that the negative comments are the result of circumstances that are the exception rather than the rule. 

The restaurant is very clean, the rest rooms were also clean. If you eat here when there's a 1\/2 hour wait or more, I'm sure you will find things a bit less put together simply because of volume and the nature of a buffet. Our server, whose name I regretfully forget, was wonderful and attentive even at the end of her shift.  She even offered to make me a cherry coke and it was perfect.  Everything was available, it was all fresh and tasted quite good. Crab legs were refilled often and continued to be filled until we left around 3pm even though they are supposed to be turning over for dinner. The fresh fruit is also great quality and delicious right now. They continue to have a nice selection of deserts and the cr√®me br√ªl√©e was good, perhaps not quite as delicate as a gourmet pastry chef might prepare it but the flavor was lovely.  No, they do not have the biggest selection I've ever seen, but bigger selections don't necessarily mean better. There's something for everyone here and I know I'd rather have them focus on quality over quantity.  

Prices vary depending on time of day (breakfast\/lunch vs dinner) and day of the week (mon-thurs vs fri-sun).  The best price available will be for breakfast\/lunch mon-thurs, but you can earn 2 for 1 buffet vouchers by playing MGM's My Vegas apps and earning loyalty points towards rewards such as this one. You can also redeem these points for a single free buffet. So, I heartily recommend this buffet and I look forward to going back for dinner before we leave.",0,0,0

Perfectly portioned and cute to boot. Did I mention the dessert station?

Despite the horrific reviews for The Buffet at Aria, our group had to test out this new buffet for ourselves.  We walked in with virtually little to no expectations and were pleasantly surprised.

Because it was lunch (about $18) on a Monday, the buffet was not crowded, and we were seated prompty.  Everything was spic and span clean, and service was very friendly and welcoming.  The food choices, although not as plentiful as, say, the buffets at Wynn or Bellago, were not bad at all.  And the desserts were especially appealing in presentation and the majority also in taste.

Parking - MGM properties rolled out their paid parking. It's annoying but I guess there's not much I can do about it. I wish they could validate for eating there or something but anyway..

Came here on a Fri night around 6:30pm, there was no line to get in but the place was only around 40-50% capacity which was actually kind of surprising - as it's usually even less than that during peak hours. 

Our server was Maryann, she was wonderful to deal with. She always came by every several minutes to check on us and was very friendly. 

As far as food selection\/quality compared to the other resorts, this place is probably closer to a 3.5 star. The other 0.5 star they earned from me is from the good service we've consistently had. 

The good-if you come fri-sun for dinner, they usually have king crab legs and oysters. Quality is generally acceptable as long as you don't come too late in the day. The meat carving section is also usually pretty good - definitely get the prime rib if you're a fan. 

Worth a try-I always find myself eating the Indian food- the naan bread, tandoori chicken and the curries always find their way to my plate. Their dessert section is small compared other buffets but still acceptable. They have their famous spinning wheel of gelato\/ice cream as well as little different cakes and such. I usually find myself ending the meal with a cake pop and some coffee. 

The not so good-the Asian food is a joke. I'm sorry. The ""sushi"".. Is very sad looking. The fruit selection is almost non existent. The cheeses look like they've been out for too long and the pizzas are always kinda dried up.  They used to grill large shrimps and scallops in the middle but I think they pulled the plug on that. 

In summary, come here for the king crab legs and oysters on the weekend if that's what you're into.  Or if you like to sample little bits of each kind of cuisine.  If it's not your thing then I suggest you go somewhere else.",2,0,1

Damn. While heading back to the strip, we found out that Wicked Spoon was also closed between 2:30 - 5 pm and we passed on spending $60 each for Bacchanal. Instead we found ourselves back at Aria and decided to give the Buffet at Aria a try.

We missed the lunch cut-off at 3 pm by 20 minutes, so we paid the dinner price at $37.99 per head. The buffet's food area is not as comprehensive as Bacchanal, but still offered plenty of selection for indulging. If looking from left to right, they have Sweets, Asian, Italian, Pizza, Mediterranean, Tandoori, Latin, Carvery, and Diner. Two islands in the middle of it all have the Fish Market and Salad. I was pleasantly surprised with the seafood variety available: steamed crab legs, peelable shrimp, clams, mussels, seared ahi tuna, cooked salmon, seafood paella, sushi, and more. I was also pleasantly surprised that they have Coke Zero available from their offerings of Coke drink products!

Other than the seafood, I filled up on prime rib (so yummy with fresh horseradish too!), creamed corn, mac and cheese, and spinach dip. If you stop by the Salad area, they have fresh fruit juice and thai tea ready for dispensing. At the end of the meal, I was slightly disappointed with their desserts. While I enjoyed the oreo whoopie pie, tiramisu cup, cookies and Merlyn Monroe popcorn (white chocolate drizzled popcorn), their gelato and ice cream flavors were just okay. I usually like to end with a fruit sorbet, but they only had coconut and mandarin yuzu. Coconut - I'm allergic to, and mandarin yuzu - super tart.

They have a large selection of seafood, from crab legs, clams, prawns, mussels, and much more. They even have the options of hot and cold, where you get the traditional seafood cold on ice or cooked in awesome sauces, still warm. Either way, both are fresh and delicious. 

They had a lot of different stations:
-meat carving station with selections of chicken, prime rib, and sausage
-a make your own taco and nacho station with choice of cheese, sour cream, pico de gallo, guacamole, salsa roja, salsa verde, etc
-Asian station with fried rice, soups, dim sum, general tsao's chicken, and more

It's 38 a person for dinner which is pretty cheap for what they advertised, unlimited wine and a whole Maine lobster. First off the wine was blah. And they were super strict on the serving of the Maine lobster. It was 1 per person and they triple check to make sure you haven't already gotten one. With all of the scrutiny I figure it would be a decent presentation of the lobster. NOPE! Just boiled. It had no flavor. Also it didn't arrive until almost the end of the meal even though we requested it at as soon as we sat down. I started down the buffet line and first things first it was king crab legs, pre split. Which was a definite plus since the spines on the king crab legs are a pain to fight through. They were always low on them and I didn't feel like waiting for more in that terribly long line. I tasted almost all of the other items and it was nothing amazing. The best dish was the lobster ravioli. I did have 2 plates of that. 

The service was terrible, the waitress looked pissed off and barely ever cleared our plates and instead of refilling drinks she just brought out new ones, but she only did that once. 

Recommendation, come for an early dinner to avoid the crowds, stick to the king crab legs and lobster ravioli.",5,0,2

I have a hard time paying $40-50 for a dinner buffet when I mainly just want unlimited crab legs.  Found out Aria puts out crab legs for lunch which sold us.  Why pay $40-50 when you can pay $25 instead.  We got there at 2:30 and the menu didn't change when they had dinner switch over so we saved some money by going a little early.  The prime rib was excellent as well. The shrimp and grits was the surprise hit with me.  If looking for a nice buffet I recommend Aria but I also hear there are a couple other good ones as well.  The only thing I would say that should be better is the desserts.  They all look great but just wasn't super impressed with that section.

Food is not presented well, served from ""windows"" cut out of a wall.. very cafeteria like.  Many tables are empty.. which I take means Aria staff pace the line vs. over-stuffing the buffet line.

Biggest line was for the crab legs.  I am not a crab connosseir but I enjoyed them.  They are served cold\/ice with lime\/lemons vs. hot\/steamed.  Breakfast burrito, believe it or not, was very good.  So was the thick sliced bacon (a very nice touch).  Hash browns were bland, dry, bricks.  Omelette station was there.  Eggs benedict too too buttery, but otherwise nicely done.  Desserts were very good.  I wish i tried to eat more in retrospect.   I was offput by the presentation I guess..

There was no line, but now we know why. In the hopes of making the buffet look modern\/minimalistic, they have made the whole place look cheap and nasty with orange color everywhere, making the overall look similar to a school cafeteria. The food was less than desirable, aside maybe from the roast beef. The dim sum was a very poor rendition of the real Chinese treat and the Indian chicken Korma was rather lacking in spice and taste. The sushi suffered from lack of any particular taste, along with the smoked salmon and prawns. My Husband tried the sausages and said these were tough and fatty. The pizza was little better than a flatbread with a few pepperoni slices as topping. Desserts were okay I suppose, although I was looking for some sugar free varieties but found there were just 2 types of muffin on display. Ice cream looked okay with a good selection. On the plus side, our waitress was very pleasant and supplied our ice teas very quickly.

First off, they advertise themselves as being the Crab Leg central of Las Vegas. If by ""crab leg,"" they mean ""cold small crab fingers\/slivers,"" then yes, this is your place. 

Second, the rest of the buffet was mismatched, random and clearly lacking in any menu planning whatsoever.  You would have a carving station with lamb (no prime rib on the Sunday Brunch Menu, go figure), then next to it, you would have enchiladas, then scrambled eggs. Nothing made sense.

It has all the standard stations that you'd expect from a Vegas buffet, just without the premier foods. 

I got my money's worth from eating endless snow crab that was already cut in half so it was time efficient! They have normal crab claws, but it takes too much time to open it. If you're one of those people who say "" but there's more meat in the claws"" think again. Although you might be right, you can eat the crab meat a lot faster from the ones that are already cut open than taking time to open the crab claws. Thus resulting in more meat! 

The service here seemed to have died.. I remember having great service last year with constant refills and check ups. Now you have to chase down someone just for more napkins.. 

Despite the fall in service and quality of food, I would probably come back again just for the crab and the flan.

How could such an exceptional hotel like Aria have such a mediocre buffet? It just doesn't match up. I'm 50 years old, and I've probably been to over 50 buffets. I just don't understand how could anyone give this place 4 or 5 stars?

If you want details, here's what I did and did not like:

1. Crab Legs - Lots of snow crab, cold & steamed. But, no claws, and the small legs had NO flavor. They must be overboiled or old.

2. Mexican Food - Poor selection and odd choices for dishes. I love Mexican food, but found nothing here I wanted seconds on. 

3. Meat Station - Prime Rib was just ok, Ham was undercooked, brisket was good, Salmon was good.

4. Sushi - If you want some vegatables or cream cheese wrapped in rice and seaweed I guess you'll be ok. If you want actual sushi with real fish and seafood, you'll have to go somewhere else. 

5. Breakfast Food - Eggs, eggs, everywhere! If you just want freshly cooked eggs and omelets,  you will love it here. But then, why not just go to Dennys? Its a lot cheaper!  Oh, and the hashbrowns here are mediocre to bad. 

6. Drinks - I bought the $13 drink package. If you want a mimosa with your brunch, you'll have it in a small round glass and it will taste bad.  Want Sangria? You'll have it in a small round glass and it will be mediocre. Want a glass of wine? It will be bad wine served in a small round glass. Want beer? YES get the beer!! Its brand name and on tap. But of course, it will be served in a small round glass!! For $13 though, how can you go wrong?

6. Deserts - Bland, bland, bland...  Gelato - good, good, good!! But why did you take my favorite - Pistachio and make it fat free? Just give me the good stuff!! Afterall, I'm eating at a buffet!!

7. Service - Table wait staff - Good!  Wait staff at service stations - Poor!

Overall - Not something I expected at Aria. I thought it would be much higher quality. I spent the whole time trying something else, hoping I'd find at least one item that I wanted seconds on. Other than the gelato, it didn't happen.",1,1,0

I came here for dinner with my friends on a Friday and it wasn't really packed at all.  We found out it was unlimited wine after we paid which was like ~$40 (just like any other buffet place in Vegas or prob cheaper).  So definitely worth it!  They had all kinds of food here from Italian to Indian to American to Asian.  The list felt like it went on and on.  Again, I am not a dessert kind of guy, but wow the thing I remembered most was their dessert...(sadly I know...)  Their strawberry shortcake...OUT OF THIS WORLD! It was so flaky and delicious.  Wasn't super sweet like most places.  Just RIGHT!  Next on the list...I know I'm weird...the marshmallow! Marshmallow...really?  YES REALLY!  By far the best tasting marshmallow ever!  It's located next to the chocolate dipped strawberries...(IMO sucked balls).

You have to take into consideration at a buffet you're paying for at least 3 meals, dessert & multiple drinks per person so $50 + tip is great!

The food: Theres SO many choices here! mexican, fish market, asian (sushi, build your own pho, etc), indian, italian, a salad bar, soul food (fried chicken, mac and cheese) various meats and an array of desserts (key lime, gelato, caramel popcorn, popcorn with chocolate drizzling, etc).

It was a Wednesday night at 7:30 PM. An hour later, my prayers to the food gods were answered and we were finally seated. We were a party of 3 and paid $34.99 each. Feel like getting drunk? Get the bottomless drinks for $12.99 each. 

The place itself was clean and service was efficient after being seated. I wasted no time. I swiftly ran to the bathroom to wash my hands and went straight to the first station I saw: Asian. 

The first plate I got was cashew chicken with fried rice and some Italian chicken along with beef and broccoli. The cashew chicken and beef and broccoli and fried rice were pretty decent but the Italian chicken tasted too much like wine so I didn't finish it. The cashew chicken was too nutty for my taste. 

My second plate was crab legs and sushi. The sushi wasn't any greater than other sushi I have tasted (it was spicy salmon) and the snow crab legs were good too. I don't really know how to open crab legs so I probably would've had a better experience if I knew how to open them, haha. 

My third plate was spaghetti with marinara and alfredo sauce, shrimp, onions, tomatoes, and mushrooms. I actually finished all of this but it wasn't the best pasta I have had (check out Carmine's in NYC). 

My fourth plate was actually dessert because I was waiting for my beef ribs to cook. So instead of just waiting and wasting time, I decided to continue eating. My favorite dessert was the flan; it was absolutely phenomenal. The tiramisu cake sucked so I didn't finish it (way too much espresso). The cheesecake was alright. The cupcakes, yogurt, macaron, and brownie on the stick was ok too. I got chocolate gelato as well...it was meh.

My fifth plate was finally my beef ribs, macaroni and cheese, and mashed potatoes. This was probably my best plate. The mac n cheese and mashed potatoes were delicious. However, the beef ribs could have been cooked more and had more flavor. 

Besides all of the stuff I ate, they had a salad bar, pizza, an Indian station, etc. 

After consuming all this food, I could not get up and entered into food coma. It took me 2-3 hours to recover. 

Overall, I think buffets value quantity over quality but this was one of the better buffets I have been to. However, the food was not particularly phenomenal and didn't get my taste buds dancing. If you're really hungry and what OK food, check it out. I didn't get to check out the Bacchanal Buffet but I know it is also more expensive at $50.

This gets 3 stars because the food wasn't that great and the line was too long, but it was a fair price. They say what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, but the memory of this bland food will stay with me forever.",7,5,1

The buffet at Aria was average. It was unimpressive for what i thought would be a buffet equal to that of other 5-star hotels like Bellagio or Wynn. 

In terms of variety, I felt the aria buffet tried to accomplish that by offering a number of different international cuisines such as indian, chinese, japanese, etc. However, i still felt that WITHIN each cuisine, there just wasn't much. For example, sure they had japanese food, but specifically they only had 3 types of rolls and some nigiri. No other types of sashimi, no unique rolls, no tempura, etc etc. 
In terms of seafood, they had the usual king crab legs, shrimp scampi, and oysters, but it wasn't any different from what you would find in any other decent buffet. 
In terms of how they serve you the food, it's a little strange: they have their food on smallerl serving plates. While this may give an impression that the dishes are more fresh and replenished more frequently, this also causes an inconvenience to the customer when dishes are constantly running out and staff members have to refill it. This means customers waste more time waiting for their food than eating it. 
On a more positive note, the service was excellent. This is strange just because no one really notices the service or remembers their waiter in a buffet, but mine was so good that i certainly did remember. She was always refilling our drinks, asking if we needed anything, and never late in clearing our used plates.

Perhaps it was the king crab legs and oyster bar, but those didn't even taste fresh. 

I've got a few bones to pick with this buffet:
1. I wasn't impressed with the selection of food they had.
2. Items weren't filled up when empty and counters weren't wiped down. 
3. Instead of placards that indicate what dish it is, they used a sharpie to write on the glass.

The restaurant is located on the 2nd floor and brilliantly withholds the contemporary theme of the hotel itself.  Upon arrival in the late afternoon, we were greeted by the absence of the line of people in front, but with a warm joyful welcome of the energetic restaurant host.  The pricing is actually excellent compared to any other buffets within the proximity of the strip. (Less than $40\/person, depending on lunch or dinner and the day of the week)

The layout of the buffet is nice and simple.  The beginning of the linear path starts off with seafood and sushi, and as you work your way down, there are vast food selections yielding cuisine of different ethnic cultures. 
~ The crab legs were freshly chilled and sliced in half for easy access to the succulent crab meat.  The cocktail shrimp had a great texture, not too firm and not too tender. The sushi quality and selection were good but not amazing.  
~ I also enjoyed the worldly choices of entrees:  The chicken curry was well-prepared and simmered in a rich plethora of exotic herbs.  It complemented the soft and toasty naan bread, immediately making it one of my favorite dishes.  I also enjoyed the tender slice of prime rib, which was rich in flavor.  The selections of the Chinese and Italian dishes were also delicious and enjoyable.
~The assortment of desserts made a great impression the end of our little feast.  Some of the cakes were a little too sweet (such as the Snickers cake), while others were at its optimum level of sweetness.  The macaroons served to please the taste buds with the correct level of coconutiness.  The gelato was also rich, irresistible, and kept calling for our attention even when our stomachs were filled of the hot savory food from right before. The choco-chip cookies were scrumptious...

My wife and I heard all the raves about The Buffet at Aria so decided to cashed in on the comp dinner buffet from Myvegas.

Food - 0\/5

We did the typical routine, walking around getting a little of each to try so we know which one to come back for seconds. On the outside, all foods look very picture perfect, but boy were we wrong.  The food tasted like the chefs had extra salt laying around so they decided to add a few extra table spoons to each dish. I finished 2 glasses of coke before I could finish what was on my plate. After ""the sample"" dish, we bolted for the desert and didn't bother coming back for seconds. 

Desert was just ok. Nothing exceptional.

Service - 5\/5

Our server was great. Bring our second glass of drink right when we finish our first one. That's attention to detail. Keep up the good work.

Not sure if I am being fair with this as I generally do not enjoy buffets...any place that I have have to wait in line or watch people mull around with plates of food in their hands while they ""sample and eat"" at various food stations does not appeal to me.

Needless to say The Buffet at Aria has vastly improved from its original days.  Clean, open dining area seen from the hallway makes it feel spacious.  The individual food stations were small while the portions were also small...nice!  Better than a huge stainless steel tray and a spoon where you scoop up your portion size. I think this is better so that you will eat smaller portions and more variety.

It was nice to see a seafood station that is part of their regular menu...nit some special Only on Friday or the weekend.

The steamed crab legs were delicious and salted just right and the iced crab claws were delicious as well. Besides attacking the crab legs and claws (which constituted the majority of my meal) I also tried the osso bucco, which was delicious and resulted in me coming back for seconds.

Caramel macchiato and chocolate gelato with caramel syrup, Oreo cookies, and banana flamb√©. The flan was good too, but a little too sweet for my taste.

I took my practiced hand to ""The Buffet"" at Aria last weekend when I was in sin city. It's a good choice though not the best buffet I've visited. It features a few stand-outs -- and a few misses -- among otherwise average food.

I'll get to what I liked and didn't like in a moment, but first allow me to share my philosophy on smart buffet dining.

To get the full dining experience at any buffet you need to go in with a plan. There is no wrong plan, it's all a matter of personality.

For example, the Scouters will tell you to do a walk-thru of all the counters before even picking up a plate. The Meat Heads go straight for the carving table to satisfy their carnivorous cravings and get their ""money's worth"". The Aristocrats start with courses -- maybe a hearty salad and soup for round 1, followed by the protein and carbs in round 2, and finished off nicely with a dessert and coffee for round 3.

But for me, I personally fall firmly into the Forager camp. I am curious and I like variety. I need to try as many tastes as I can in order to feel my trip to the buffet has been a success.

Therefore, I start at one end with one plate and literally take just a spoonful of each item that remotely catches my interest. I'll sit down  with a plate that looks something like this:

A small helping of a greens and typical salad toppings, two pieces of sushi, a spoonful of garlic mashed potatoes, a beef enchilada, two small spoonfuls of lamb curry, a spoon of basmati rice, some blueberries, a spoon of Mediteranean pasta salad, and a slice of lamb with some mint jelly.

To the untrained eye, my plate looks like the mess of a buffet novice, however there is order to my chaos. It's all about portion control. I get one, maybe two bites of everything. Then I can go back and try other things, or get more of the items I loved from the first round.

I'd say I got to sample at least 80% of Aria's buffet this way. Here are my favorites:

1) Leg of lamb at the carving station
2) NY Strip at the carving station
3) Shrimp Cocktail
4) Freshly made garlic naan (they even have a tandoori oven at the counter!)
5) Lychee, scallop coconut salad
6) Crab Legs (I can't eat them, but everyone at my table said they were great)
7) Creme Brulee

Things I didn't like:
1) sub-par sushi
2) beef enchilada
3) dulce leche dessert
4) not enough labels on food (was I eating lamb curry, or beef curry?)

Another part of the plan: make sure you go for brunch -- it was $26 (with tax) before 4 p.m. The prices rises to $30+ for dinner.",1,0,1

I took my husband here for Father's Day because he wanted to try this place out - this buffet ruined our holiday, single handed. As an avid buffet adventurer, I have been to 90% of the buffets offered on the Strip - and, congratulations, you are by far the WORST one yet. Before you start defending your so-called gourmet delicacies, I'd like to say that I am not a buffet expert, a chef, or anyone who knows culinary art. However, I have eaten at a LOT of buffets, more than I care to count, mainly because I enjoy variety in my food and the endless possibilities, and I'd like to think that I have at least somewhat of an idea of what food is supposed to taste like. But, let me make my case:

1. The food..MEDIOCRE, at best. For a very expensive buffet ($50\/person), it lacked everything that an expensive buffet had. Let me start with the selection - limited, bland, and everything was just all wrong. 
ASIAN - they had vegetable dumplings, vegetable potstickers, vegetable everything (more on veggies later). There were only 2 choices of soup there, fried rice, chow mein, and crab legs. ITALIAN - spaghetti, some kind of veggies (again), veggie lasagna, a bowl of banana chips and a bowl of cranberries (WTF?). 
CARVING STATION - meats were cold...they just sat there under a heat lamp, but once it hit your plate, it went cold quick. 
TANDOORI - I'm sorry, I'm not Indian, but I swear the ""tandoori chicken"" looks\/tasted exactly like baked chicken. Not sure why they even tried to pass that off as anything tandoori. The rest of the curry tasted like melted mustard.
DELI - didn't even try this station, it just looked like a large collection of Lunchables meats and cheese. 
FISH MARKET (seafood station) - The station was full of duplicate foods just too make it look like it was filled. Two buckets of crab legs, 2 buckets of crawfish, 2 buckets of mussels, and 1 bucket of oysters. The oysters looked like they were picked from the bottom of the reject buckets from other, better, buffets. The oysters were stale tasting, and they sat in a pile on the ice...the ones on top were warm and the ones on bottom were still frozen. Pretty sure they're not supposed to be like that at all - something about food regulations, I'm sure. 
DESSERT - this is by far the only dessert station on the Strip that pales in comparison to the dessert bar at my local 9.99 Chinese buffet. The desserts aren't even made there - they came from a box, and all your ""chefs"" did was pull it out of the box and plop it on a plate. And seriously, who serves chocolate chip cookies and boxed pies? At a $50\/person buffet? I expected this from the $9.99\/person Chinese buffet down the street from my house, but not from YOU, fancy-hotel&buffet-on-the-strip. I was really, really disappointed. 

2. Did I mention the customer service? The ""chef"" at the seafood station was rude and nasty. I was standing next to a young girl waiting for the prawns. She obviously didn't know ENglish because the chef asked what she wanted and she just pointed at the grill. He proceeded to YELL at her at least a half dozen times with things like ""WHAT?"" WHAT DO YOU WANT?"" ""YOU WANT ONE? TWO? WHAT DO YOU WANT???"" It got to the point that the girl hung her head down, shook her head and walked away. It was the worst type of customer service I had ever experienced. And this asshole of a chef just looked at me and asked me what I wanted, ""WHAT YOU WANT?"" and I just walked away. It was despicable. The second instance of poor customer service was when I had to ask for a water refill...TWICE. On a day where the facility was not even half full...there were empty tables around us. Why did I have to keep asking for water when we are literally 1 out of only 4 tables for you? Seriously.

To be quite frank, the food did not deserve the $110.00 I spent for my husband and I that day. What really made me bad was the poor customer service; I was embarrassed for the hotel more than anything. I work really hard for my money - and I don't mind paying a lot of money for good food (Bacchanal's price is even lower than this dump) - but seriously, the food did NOT justify the price. Furthermore, the customer service left a bad taste in my mouth. I have already started telling my friends, family, and co-workers not to waste their money on such a poor excuse of a ""buffet"" - you're better off sticking with your mom & pop Chinese buffet down the street - you'll get the same food, but you'll save $40\/per person.",5,2,0

Thought I died and went to heaven. I was able to try out some Mediteranian food which I'd never had before. The list goes on and on.

Our waitress was quick to replenish drinks and wisk away dirty plates. She was also very good natured which can make or break any dining experience.

The dessert portion was meh but I'm not a huge dessert person. 

We had a 2 for 1 coupon which helped keep costs down. We ended up paying just under $20 each. It is a costly buffet but well worth it. I'm dreaming about the day we can go back.",0,0,0

Coming here I was super excited to try the crab legs. The best part was that they had some that were warm. One thing I did love  were the shrimp in little cocktail glasses. Adorable. They were pretty darn good but overall I would not come back to this buffet just for that factor.

I wouldn't even call it a buffet. It has about half as many options as bellagio, wicked spoon, and bacchanal. The Latin section had maybe four options. Rice, green chile verde, asada burritos and these weird quesadilla things. 

All the food was hard and disappointing. You could tell that it had been sitting under the lamps for way too long. The scallop potatoes were dry, not creamy and cold. The BBQ brisket slider was dry, the BBQ sauce disappeared into the bun and had hardly any meat. The mash potatoes were lacking something. Maybe salt? The max and cheese was good but def nothing special. I could whip something up similar in my own kitchen for my toddler.

The prime rib was very good though. Not too fatty and it was cooked just the way I enjoy it.. Medium rare. I actually went back for seconds. Another item that I thought was cool, was a pick your salad and they toss\/make it for you. I liked that. I haven't seen that at other buffets. But honestly that was the only special item. 

The desserts were blah, nothing special yet again except one item.. The lemon bars! Yum. Got to get the cope for those. The carrot cake was dry, had no raisins and had a pineapple salsa on the me plate that didn't pair well at all with it. 

Overall a little disappointing but on a happy note they have unlimited drinks for 12.99. You can mix and change it up from sangria to white wint to beer to special drinks. That's a good deal and something to keep in mind.",3,0,1

Had the shrimp cocktail - two big shrimps in a small shot glass- pretty presentation and good since the size of shrimp was big. Everything else was cold. We went on to dessert and was not impressed. I had the flan and it was ok. Our waitress was just ok- we had to wait awhile to get drinks. Btw, you pay at first and then get seated. The cashier asked if we wanted unlimited alcohol for $12.99 and based on what I saw I declined.

The waitress said because I didn't order at beginning, it would cost an extra $1- what's up with that? Not like the buffet was cheap.

Last week, on a random trip to Vegas, the BF and I stopped by Aria to check it out.  After scoping out the interior and playing at the tables\/slots for a bit (they have the COOLEST slot machines!), we decided that we should probably eat.

Neither of us were very hungry, so we didn't want to check out a steakhouse or anything... In fact, we didn't even want to check out a buffet.

So why we ended up at The Buffet, I've no idea.  What matters is, we did.

At 9:30pm on a Monday night, the place was pretty dead.  Apparently, last seating is at 10pm, so we weren't surprised by the near-empty restaurant.  But whatever.  We weren't in the mood for anything special anyway.

The cashier at the front was lame.  She wasn't rude, but she was totally disinterested.  Then again, 30 minutes before closing on a Monday night, her blah attitude was understandable.

But the hostess and the servers?  Super nice and friendly!  All throughout the meal, they were very attentive, refilling our every glass, even going so far as to bring me a box of tissues (I couldn't stop sneezing for some reason).

The servers behind the buffet were just as friendly, taking care to explain all the various dishes they had out and making their recommendations.  Again, 30 minutes before closing on a Monday night, we didn't expect excellent food choices.

To be fair, the food choices were mediocre.  There was an Asian section (most of it was just whatevers), an Indian section (I didn't try it, but the BF thought it was pretty stellar), an Italian section (I didn't bother), a full-service pasta station, a seafood station (I didn't go near here, but I assume they had crab, bc I saw people eating crab legs), a meat carving station, a kebab station, yadda yadda.

Admittedly, the ""choices"" were plentiful.  However, not everything was available.  For example, they were out of kebabs for the night.  Completely understandable.

I got myself a giant hunk of prime rib.  I debated on the turkey and the lamb, but thought better of it and stuff to my beef.  They had everything to go with it (mint jelly, horseradish, blah blah blah), and all the yummy sides.

The salad bar was pretty decent, too.

Here's the thing.  It's a typical buffet.  BUT!!!  The QUALITY is amazing!  Everything was SO FRESH!!!

Again, I have to note that it was 30 minutes before closing on a Monday night.  How fresh could the food be?  I was sure it had been lying around all night, and the ""cooks"" probably didn't even bother to put their hearts and souls into the food.

However, everything was crisp, cold, hot, fresh, etc.

I don't normally like buffets because the food tastes old, but The Buffet had food that practically tasted made-to-order!

As if that wasn't satisfying enough...

THE DESSERT.

I only recently became a fan of desserts.  Even with my newfound appreciation for the sweet concoctions, however, I can't exactly say that I love to gorge on desserts after every meal.  I'm more of a ""few bites"" type of gal.

Well... The Buffet's dessert selection was SO AMAZING.  Everything was plated so beautifully on modern frosted glass plates, each bit of dessert complimented by some sort of accent ""side.""

After a second of browsing, the BF and I decided... We had to try EVERYTHING.

Yep.

Key lime pie with a homemade marshmallow stick - I don't even LIKE key lime pie, but this was great!  Not too tart, not too sweet... and the marshmallow stick was AWESOME!

Strawberry Shortcake - Hands down MY FAVORITE.  The marscapone cream was so light and perfect, and the cake itself was FANTASMO!

Nutella Cake - I expected this one to be weird, but it was a great mix of hazelnut chocolate and coffee.  Holy cow.  I think this one had some sort of orange marmalade looking thing on the side.

Bananas Foster - This was the only thing I was MEH about.  I thought it was good, but much too sweet.

Creme Brulee - I've NEVER had a creme brulee at a buffet and thought it tasty.  This was PERFECT!  The consistency wasn't all super-curdled.  It was light and not too yolk-y.  I don't remember what this was paired with.

Cream Puffs - Cream puffs at buffets are usually gross.  THESE WERE NOT.  Little puffs of HEAVEN, dude!

There were a bunch of other desserts, like rice crispies (totally good!), cookies (a great variety), bread pudding (steaming!), and whatnot.  Each plated dessert came with some sort of pairing.  I can't remember which dessert it was, but there was one with some pineapple marmalade sort of thing, and that was GOOOOOOOOOOOOD.

They also have a gelato bar.

Anyway.  Seriously.  Five stars just for the dessert alone.  FAN TAS TIC!

I swear, I'm going back again and again and again and again.",5,3,6

We decided to check out the Buffet at Aria.  My mister's iPhone had run out of juice, so I didn't know what rating this place was getting...so I tried it without and bias.  They were serving brunch and the price wasn't too bad, $23, but you can add $5 for bottomless champagne\/mimosa...of course I added the bubbly.  The place was spacious and well lit since it had huge windows with views of the pool area.  They had a lot of food choices, but I always judge the buffet based on the seafood selection.  Here's the breakdown:

GOOD: 
-touch screen menus in the front (cool factor)
-king crab legs (which you can request them to steam them for you...a must!) 
-oysters
-shrimps (cocktail style and chinese style (fried with skin on)
-lamb chops
-gelato
-macarons
-strawberries (sweet just like it was freshly picked from the Oxnard farm)

OKAY
-prime rib was decent, nothing to die for
-champagne was ok, didn't really pair well with the OJ, or maybe the OJ wasn't freshly squeezed. 
-crepes, eggs benedict, omelette station

UGLY
-Although our waitress was nice, she was slow to come around to get our drink order and get check on us.
-Sauces were located in wierd spots, gravy was next to the asian food.
-limited sushi selection

Overall, the buffet wasn't bad for the price, but I've had better.",6,2,3

Got in with minimal waiting. I'm a red wine snob, so tried both red and white and opted for the Chardonnay, as the Malbec served was weaker in flavor. The lobster came quickly was served hot, tender and moist. The salads were fantastic... watermelon with jicama, tomatoes with figs, marinated mushrooms with garlic & peppers, and a medley of olives, cornichons, garlic & rosemary. Nice sushi selection for apps, but basic rolls, nothing unusual. Massive amts of crab legs with fresh lemon and drawn butter. The Asian green bean and beef entree was seasoned well and veggies crisp and flavorful. The lobster ravioli was delicious and very  gourmet. The tandoori chicken, naan and curry were great! The roasted veggies had pitty-pans (baby squash) which are pretty pricey at the market.The lamb was overcooked for my taste and difficult to get a rare slice. All in all very well done with minimal disappointments. Not  a huge selection for dessert, but all we tried was light and tasty. Service was ok... seemed understaffed for as pricey as it is!

I spent a good chunk of time exploring City Center last week, and I hoped to cap off an amazing personal tour by enjoying a buffet that was going to set the bar and contend with the Wynn buffet.  The Aria hotel and casino as a whole, with so much beauty and attention to detail from floor to ceiling, left me captivated and wide-eyed... kinda like watching Avatar in 3D for the first time. 

And then came the buffet... ugh...booooooooring.  The wall finishes were tacky and makes you dizzy\/nauseous... not good for a meal.  The layout is confusing, with the shrimp located all the way across the dining area from the crab?  How does that make sense?  Trying to control the crowds to make up for the fact the walkway has so little space???

I haven't even gotten to the food yet.  Came between the brunch and dinner to save $.  The food was subpar for what the place advertises.  Prime rib is quality as long as you get the new batch, anorexic king crab legs and pretty plump shrimp.  The breakfast items include a variety of sausages which weren't so tasty.  Sushi (Salmon Nigiri) and Chilean Sea Bass (aka ugly Patagonian Tootfish) came out for dinner.  The only thing that really stands out is that they had a fresh naan & curry food area... something that sounds like a rip-off at a buffet however.

The woman on the phone told me it's the best buffet with the best prime rib and huge king crab legs. We were sold. We live on the opposite side of town so it took us about 30 min to get there. Get to the buffet around 5:30 and it's pretty empty. There was a large party in front of us of about 9 and they were busy getting their table ready. Meanwhile the hostess was just standing there. She could have sat my party of 3 while they were getting their table ready. So we finally get seated and go to get our food. First, there was no prime rib. Half of the food there is Indian themed, and to top it off. There was NO KING CRAB LEGS. They were snow crabs!! They were seriously so small that it was almost a joke. This buffet cost us about $140 for 3. I was furious. We drove 30 minutes for KING crab legs that they specified they had, and they didn't. So we get back to the table and we're waiting for the waitress to come and take our drink order. And we're waiting, and waiting. About 15 min later she comes by to take our drink order. I was so fed up I looked at my parents and I said stop eating. This isn't worth $40 a person. So I asked the waitress for the manager. Which took her a good while to track her down. The manager comes over and I tell her this buffet is not worth the money and you guys are falsely advertising KING crab legs when they are in fact snow crabs. I told her we wanted our money back. She didn't even hesitate. She just said sure follow me. By her not hesitating to give us a refund makes me wonder how many other people complained. She must have been used to it. We should have known by how empty the buffet was. We were obviously mad, and starving at this point. So we get our car that we valeted and we're told we had to pay $13 for parking! We weren't even in there for 30 min and had to pay. They should have had a sign out saying this is how much parking is. Overall this buffet is horrible.

Went here on a friday to check the place out (only looked outside). And the family decided to check this place out the next day(saturday). Then came Saturday and was super excited to check this buffet out because of how Aria portrayed itself, and the pricing being $35\/person(approx?), we were hoping the best of the best. If anyone of you have seen Aria, you know what I'm talking about. You enter into the casino and it's extremely modern, just the way I like it and the atmosphere is like none other casino. 

Anywho, back to the The Buffet @ Aria. We were greeted and seated really quickly with no line on a saturday(which was something I found really odd). They offered us each 1\/2 a lobster(why not a full?) and I was a bit disappointed in that, but the taste of the lobster was AAA quality! It was really sweet and cooked perfectly(at least mine was)...

THE FOOD: King crab legs and Alaskan king crab legs were a bit too much on the salty side. Taste was really plain and I was a bit disappointed to say that I HAVE HAD BETTER AT THE RIO AT RENO.. RENO? yea, RENO!!! The roast beef was delish and as well as garlic steamed clams+mussels. I believe these are the only things that were actually good IMO.

The GOOD: Free Chardonnay\/Merlot Wine (unlimited refills) on the weekends!

The BAD: 1\/2 a lobster? SERIOUSLY? Only good thing mentioned has been mentioned..

OVERALL: Not the crappiest buffet I ever been to, but definitely not the best. Better than average so I give it a 3.75 stars!

WOULD I COME BACK? NOPE. I'm sure I like MGM's buffet better... SAD, I know.",1,0,0

Went to this buffet two days in a row during a trip in Vegas. It drips with mediocrity. You'll notice they have SO MANY choices but none of them are executed well.  This buffet leaves you with a full belly but little satisfaction.

The mini donuts were fab. 2 stars.

I've tried all the dishes at the Mexican section and none of them were good. Maybe its just me...but I would just skip it! The chinese section is definitely accurate, it's not just some asian fusion thing, but real chinese food. The pasta is also great! You choose what you want in your pasta, and they make it for you! It was very delicious..and the portion is huge.So I would recommend sharing the pasta with someone else so that you have more room for other food.

I really don't have a lot to elaborate on this place... they've really got to step up their food selection! Had I known that the flavor would be bland across the board I wouldve just stuck with crab legs and dessert... those were the only things that I was actually excited about. Everything else could have been served at a Golden Corral and I wouldn't have known the difference. Bland...and\/or dry... and\/or folks trying to be clever with cooking foods that are better left keeping it simple. 
The turkey wasn't too horrible... but it wasn't good enough that I felt the need to try the other meats they had to offer..which wasn't much if I recall correctly. The mashed potatoes were bland. I had been craving pots mashed, too... so that really got me down. They had some fancy macaroni that just didn't do it for me. Perhaps I'm too country for Aria's buffet... but come on... what's a buffet without good ol' macaroni and cheese?!
If you want crab legs mid week...swing through here.. if you don't mind dropping about $40. We had a comp for a BOGO free dinner buffet (MyVegas game on Facebook) so that's what got us in...but I think that after leaving there...we will not be returning.",4,2,2

This is probably the best buffet on the strip for me. With good value $22-27 for brunch daily, you can't beat it with the good food. They have a lot of vegetables which is a plus. I am impressed, however, the sorbet selection isn't as good. I won't give a minus for this one though.

We came here around 3pm, not as packed, seated right away. Server takes sooo long to bring drinks and refills, she also takes long to pick up plates. 

The food is not great. The dim sum soggy, the bbq pork bun quickly turns cold and hard. 

The Italian station only consist of meatballs in tomato sauce and boiled noodles on the side, very bland. The chicken parmigiana is dry and salty. Looks good but doesn't taste good.

The sushi\/seafood bar, typical crab legs, crawfish, clams, and oysters. Clams and oysters not cleaned very well, sandy. The crab legs and crawfish bland no seasonings at all. Even the butter didn't taste like butter. There were only three different kind of rolls not a lot of variety and not very good. Very chewy.

Carving station is usually my favorite!!!! But nope. They had a cart of fresh prime rib, when the guest in front of me asked if he can get the meat that came out fresh and was sitting in the cart, the chef said no. He said they were not going to serve it until about 5:30pm and the time was about 4pm then. The prime rib left on the carving station was well done about two carvings left and we had to take it. I asked if I may have a piece that was medium rare but the chef acted like he couldn't hear me. 

Salad bar is the usual and last but not least I had high expectations for their dessert bar. Disgusting. Creme br√ªl√©e salty. Cookies were hard as rocks. Everything tastes so dry. The only thing good they've got going is probably the gelato which I didn't even bother to try by then.

First and last time. The hype is not real. Food is not worth $41.99 per person. Oh and my party waited until 5:30pm still no beef bone but they finally put out a new slab of meat. Wow... Not so fancy after all.",0,2,0

I am a huge seafood fan and I was excited that I can finally try stone crab claws, but these claws were frozen. They were basically crab pops. Not a fan. I loved the fresh fruits and the desserts. The vanilla gelato is to die for.

We ate here on a weekday and not a weekend (where they have lobster) and my oh my was it ever disappointing.  $30 for a weeknight buffet, knowing what I know now, we would have went to M buffet or even RIO for half off local special.  BUT now we know, and knowing is half the battle (G.I. JOE!).
You'd expect a lot more from a place like ARIA. 

SUSTENANCE: Food was okay.  The problem was the selection, not a very large buffet. The night we went they had 2 slabs of meat , prime rib and beef brisket at the carving station.  The Prime Rib was a little dry and not as good as other buffets that serve that cut.  The brisket was a bit better and was very tender and delicious. They had a plethora of salads, i enjoyed the spicy shrimp and the orzo salad, not too bland and good flavor.  Crab legs were chilled and pre-sliced leaving you to do little work to get that oh so succulent crab meat.  
TIP: You can have them steam your crab legs if you ask!

They had the typical fare for the rest of the buffet and though the selection wasn't that large to begin with you can tell they were at least TRYING to be a good buffet. There was a trio of Indian fare (chicken in curry and an eggplant dish were pretty decent), some Italian selections (pasta station w\/ choice of 3 sauces - pomodoro, alfredo, and i forget the 3rd), Mexican station (gauc, shredded beef, umm I couldn't find tortilla shells), and a Chinese area (typical Chinese food - chow mein, orange chicken, etc).

Dessert was good.   Cinnamon bread pudding, red velvet whoopee pies, and carrot cake with a strawberry sauce were my fav's.  
but still... 
You'd expect a lot more from a place like ARIA. 

AMBIANCE: Modern decor with bright colors and tiles on the wall.  A little plain and one person in our group even mentioned that it felt like we were eating at a hospital cafeteria. We all agreed. 
You'd expect a lot more from a place like ARIA. 

For $30, I would rather walk across the bridge to cosmopolitan and eat at Wicked Spoon Buffet for $5 more.

Before deciding on staying we asked the very friendly cashier if we could ""view"" the buffet. They kindly obliged. We skimmed our way down the buffet, crab legs, shrimp, prime rib, pizza, chinese food and oooo dessert! They had us with the crab legs and dessert =) 

They have all the basic offering of most buffets but I felt that they had a pretty nice variety of meats at their carving stations- Prime Rib, Ham, Chicken, Turkey, Lamb and I think Bison? A good variety and it definitely silenced my hunger. A couple of my favorites were the sauteed red snapper, the szechwan beef and dessert bar! Great selection for desserts ranging from fluffy pink marshmallows, chocolate dipped strawberries, brownie pudding, key lime pie, nutella tarts and assorted cookies. 

Overall a good experience! Our server was friendly, kept our drinks full and didn't leave us with piled plates on our table. The food while not excellent was good and I felt offered a pretty good variety and quality. 

With SO many great restaurants in Vegas it's hard to say I'll definitely be back, but I'm not against it.",0,0,0

The buffet is very pricey just like all other buffets in 5 star hotels but not all live up to the hype such as this buffet. Although it looked very nice and chic, it didn't have large selection compared to Bellagio and Bachannel Buffet. My shrimp cocktail only came in small cups with one shrimp inside. They didn't have a a shrimp pile like most buffets just a small dessert size cup with one shrimp and some cocktail sauce. The king crab legs were very good and so was the rest of the food, I just wished they had a wider selection of food but the dessert section kinda made up for it.

They had a lot of different kinds of cakes with my favorite the key lime pie and the occasional cheesecake, gelato, fresh fruit and warm baked cookies. Restroom is located right behind the dessert section so it beats walking outside of the buffet.

The buffet is located in the 2nd level of the casino right next to the Zarkana theater, Gold Lounge, pool and the hotel elevators. Buffet overall was not bad but I had better.",6,0,2

I almost asked for a refund because the food items were not appealing and I couldn't eat it if you paid me to, but I thought I'd get my money's worth with dessert...

Food: I am not a picky eater as my wife will attest, but the Aria buffet was inedible even for me. The crab legs were thawing out and were soggy. The lobster was rubbery. Curry chicken dry. Everything else tasted salty or bland. 

Service: there was unlimited wine and despite ordering the wine when we sat down, we were halfway through our meal before we were served the first round, The dirty plates were not cleared from our table and were stacked up high before they came by (we were with a party of 8). 

Seating: Our table and chairs were constantly vibrating and shaking. When we asked what was causing the vibrations, we were told that it had something to do with the air conditioning system below. The constant vibration along with the horrible food made all of us feel like we were sea sick.

We ate at Caesars first because it had better reviews. It was out of this world amazing. Then a few weeks later we tried the Aria. It was awful in comparison. Not even close.
The selection is limited, crab legs were over done and tiny, sushi was so old looking, salad bar was just tired and weak looking. Didn't even bother.
Meat carving station looked great but I tried the turkey and it had a weird flavor. My husband had the prime rib and it was dry.
When it came time for dessert they are smaller which is fine so we usually each get 3. I got 3 and my husband got 3 different ones. My daughter opted for the Gelato. All of our deserts were gross!! Just a waste of calories and waste of time for whomever is preparing them. Just so disappointing because they looked really good. The best one was the key lime pie tart thing but everything else was not good at all. Service was decent. Nothing too much to report on that.
We spent a lot of money here and were very disappointed because we wanted to love it so much!!! Our daughters name is even Aria!

Breakfast has lots of options. I tried almost everything. I really liked the chilaquiles (sort of like fried, chopped up enchiladas for those of you who have yet to try this deliciousness). The waffles, plantains, pizza, bagel and many cream cheese options were also good. There are many meat options too. 

The omelets made to order were just alright. The cooks who make them are very friendly though. The corn-beef hash was not that good. Note: their yogurt is more European (sour) in my opinion. 

What I really loved about this buffet was dinner. Save sixteen bucks and go to McDonald's for breakfast and come here for lunch or dinner. Lots of options (American, Korean, Chinese, Mexican, Italian, Indian) and everything tasted great. The standouts were the stuffed shells and Indian fare (chicken curry, rice, and garlic naan).

I'm sure it was not because it was full but because the lack of efficiency of the staff set up. They either didn't have enough hosts or they don't have a good system.

The place is very nice, I love the atmosphere and the low tones lighting blends really well with the natural light coming in from the windows, obviously this was in the day time, I came at 9AM to get some breakfast. 

Host was nice and greeted me with a smile, and she asked how I was doing and seemed pretty sincere when she asked me. She sat me at the table and just told me that I can go ahead and help myself, which makes sense... its a buffet.

As soon as I go to the main area looking for eggs, I asked one of the cooks that serve food in the islands, where I could find the eggs and seemed a little bothered that I asked him.

He did tell me that if I wanted an omelette it was in one direction but if I wanted just eggs hey were in the opposite direction. But he said it in a way like if I was supposed to know.

I got my food and sat at the table. The server came asking if I needed anything and she was very nice and smiling all the time. She actually made up for the cool that made me feel bad for asking where the food was at.

She looked stressed out but regardless she managed to keep a smile. Her name is Alicia. Kudos to her.

Now let's talk about the food, the meat and potatoes of a restaurant.

First of all I'm pretty health conscious and always want to make sure to ask a fee questions about he food.

So I grabbed a bowl of oatmeal, I added raisins and a banana to slice it up and put it in my oatmeal along with eggs.

First if all, I'm sure the eggs were not cracked there, it was probably egg batter, they didn't look like fresh cracked eggs at all.
I asked the waitress if they had coconut or almond milk which they didn't. I don't like to consume too many dairy products, and specially cow milk.

Then I asked if the orange juice they had was fresh squeezed and she said that it was all from concentrate. 

So as far as the quality of the food, it was about a 3 star. Of course I only had a small sample of the variety if food thy have available, but just by those 2 things I already know that the quality of food is not in the top of their priority list.

So here's what I say about my first visit here:

Staff Service - 4 Stars
Food Quality - 3 Stars
Variety of Food - 4 1\/2 stars.",1,3,0

I am on the My Vegas (slot game app) Facebook group and everyone raves about this place there.  I'm not very particular especially with buffets, but I was not very impressed for $42 a person.  

The sushi was nothing impressive the rice was a little dry the rolls weren't wrapped nicely.  They had spicy tuna roll and I think some sort of Philly roll.  I didn't even want to touch the salmon sashimi they had out.  Not sure if it even was salmon sushi.  Could have been cold smoked salmon.  

I thought oh I'm headed to the Prime Rib since you can't go wrong there.  I assumed there would be prime rib.  There was no prime rib.  Not sure what beef I got.  It tasted okay. 

The snow crabs were the star of the show.  If it wasn't for the snow crabs I would have been upset.  They were easy to snap open and remove the crab meat, weren't too salty and tasted delish!  King crab was meh.  They split it open for you so it's easy to access but it dried out the meat and it wasn't tasty at all.  

I tried three of their mini dishes.  I tried some braised beef over mash and it was super salty.   I then tried their clams and most of the clams were dried out sitting under the heat lamp.  And I tried the salmon.  That one was pretty good.  Not as dry as I thought it would be. 

I was so confused about their asian noodles.  They had pho noodles and ramen noodles.  The noodles were without their broth in a small bowl.  There were two broths but one was all the way in the back and looked like it was hard to access.  I thought oh well maybe it isn't pho and there is just one broth for both noodles.  That was not the case.  I accidentally poured pho broth in my ramen noodles.  

I had some of their dim sum items.  They were pretty decent but about the quality of any other cheap Chinese buffet anywhere.  

Our favorite dessert at our local casino buffets are the creme brulee.  They had it here and we were so excited.  My son got his and said, ""where's the brulee?"".  There was no candied sugar on top.  It still tasted good but come on now!  

The best part about this buffet was that kids 5-12 were free.  If it had just been my husband and I eating here I think I might have flipped out.  But since our family of five ate for less than $100.  I was okay with it.  

This made me appreciate my local casino buffet so much more!  I might update that review soon.",1,0,0

Most of the foods looked dried out.  Appears that the Buffet can't turn around the food fast enough so they just leave it under the hot lights to dry out.  The naan is pretty good.  I noticed that they had the garlic naan under the plain sign and the plain under the garlic sign.  I told the chef twice they were in the wrong place and he didn't care and didn't move them to the correct place.  The best thing in the buffet is the key lime shooter.

The amount of food is not as numerous as other buffets... but the food they had was good. I also had clam chowder - very tasty and creamy. The curry from the Mediterranean station with the basmati rice was delicious.  The prime rib was well cooked (other places it was medium rare) and very tender and tasty. The thing I did not like was the BBQ pork bun... I'm Vietnamese and we are big on dim sum... and this did not hit the spot. It tasted weird to me. They also had har gow (shrimp dumplings)... average tasting. Dessert selection was a bit dismal compared to other buffets...not a big selection and nothing really stood out. They do have waffle cones for your ice cream!

Lunch was $22. A good deal actually since it includes seafood!! I left at 2:30pm, dinner starts at 3pm and did not see a line really... maybe because today is Tuesday? 

In the end, a BIG improvement over the old buffet here... for the price, it's a pretty good deal, especially if you want more seafood stuff during lunch! But if you are looking for the vast selection at some other places, it's not really here. Service was good and my drink was always filled.",3,0,1

I know it's late but it was our last night in Vegas and we HAD to do a buffet before coming back home.  My sister who lives in Vegas suggested Aria.  

Maybe it was the timing since this buffet closes at 10 pm but most of the items didn't taste great.  Perhaps it was because it was sitting there for a while.  We did get wine with our meals though so that was a bonus (or star if I may add).  

The $42 also came with 1\/2 a lobster per person.  The lobster came at the end, when my group of 6 were already full.  Since almost everyone except me were full, I scored on a full lobster!!  So I guess I may have gotten my $42 worth with 1.5 lobsters.  

The lobster was small though.  It was cooked good, but SMALL.  I had a few plates of crab legs.  Did you know you can have your crab legs steamed up and warm?  I didn't know until I saw someone request their legs to be warmed.  I wish I knew that before eating my plate of cold crab legs.  The temperature made a difference!

A friend and I had ""brunch"" here at the Aria buffet while visiting on a trip this October (2016).  The buffet promised a brunch style but was definitely a miss on several levels.

Although we were one of the first customers, many of the food items were already ""old"" and inedible.  They had already been sitting out too long or were reused from the previous day.  The selection was lacking, especially breakfast items like such basics as scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausage links, etc.  You won't find any of that here.  For the lunch side of the menu, basics that were missing were mashed potatoes, gravies and a variety of carved meats.
Perhaps this buffet is trying too hard to cater to many different global societies, which is great, but most of the folks here were looking for the basics.

The best things here were the made to order omelets and the gelato.

Honestly, my review might have been about 3 stars maybe if it wasn't for the fact that I found a piece of HAIR in my food! It was a very short, kind of curly hair, which I'm pretty sure we all know what that would remind us of if we saw it in our food. YUCK!! It completely ruined my appetite and I wasn't able to eat any of the main entrees after that. I found it in my medium rare brisket, which I thought AT FIRST was really good, but after seeing that hair I could barely keep it down. The other food I was able to eat before I got the brisket was average. Nothing I'd go crazy for and tell my friends to pay $25. But I wasn't able to try out everything since I got the brisket in the beginning of my meal.

After a while I decided to try out the desserts. They all looked appetizing, as does most buffets with desserts, but they tasted average. Except for the strawberry shortcakes OMG heaven!! As far as from my experience, that is the only thing I'd go back there for to eat.

My friends and I were having trouble deciding on whether to go this buffet or Cosmopolitan's Wicked Spoon. But since we've already been to Wicked Spoon we decided to try this place.

I took off two stars for the horrible service my group of eight had to deal with. Sure, the person ordering drinks has a thick Chinese accent that may be difficult to understand but that should be no justification for the waitress being completely rude. It takes time for a large group to consider what drinks it wants to order. A waitress should NEVER sarcastically comment, ""Thanks for the long break."" We are not imbeciles, we understand a sarcastic comment when we hear one even though everyone at the table is speaking Chinese. Not only that, she was rude the entire time we were under her care. In fact, we didn't even get the iced tea that someone in our group had ordered.

Sadly enough, someone in our group got sick right after eating at the Aria Buffet. I'm not going to push all the blame onto the buffet but when the first thing that any of us had eaten was at the buffet, I really don't know what to think.

We've been to almost all the buffets on the strip and have been going for years. Aria's buffet received two stars not because of the food quality, but because of the disappointment factor. We expected a Wynn or Bellagio quality Buffet for the price and location, but it was well below par. The other reviews are very appropriate, it is very drab and boring inside, someone said it looked like a cafeteria, they were about right. If you went for the lobster, don't set your hopes too high.

Our group decided to give Aria buffet a try since we had already eaten at Bellagio which we knew would never disappoint. Aria did not disappoint us at all. It apparently is the only buffet in Vegas that comes with a whole Maine lobster per person! The lobster isn't small either....you get one big peice and it's good. I'd have to say the best part of the buffet for me (and I'm more of an entree person) was the desserts!!!! YUM!!!!! Save room for the desserts cuz they won't disappoint. I guess the variety of the entrees\/side dishes was good, but something was just missing for me and I can't quite figure it out - it just wasn't enough to satisfy my appetite which I consider huge. Other than the desserts, do try the garlic naan breads - YUM! Other than that.....ambience\/service is great. It's different than the other buffets also where the food is presented in a cafeteria-style lineup. It's been 5yrs since returned to Vegas so to be fair, I can't quite compare Bellagio's buffet to Aria's although I wish I had if the distance wasn't the issue since we were hanging out at Aria afterwards. After all the walking you do on the strip, anymore walking must be deemed absolutely necessary!!!

We decided to go to only one buffet. I usually go to the The Buffet at the Bellagio, but we thought to give Aria a shot since it was a new hotel and all.

Like everything else at Aria, it was beautifully decorated with modern touches.  Our waitress was attentive and the crowds weren't too bad.

Now to get into the ONE and ONLY reason why this is a two star review:  
- Holy s**t balls about the sushi.  It was like if a first grader was making sushi rice for the first time.  It was hard, under-cooked, and not sticky at all that sushi rice is suppose to be.  No one should be forced to eat things that can make your bowels run like Niagara Falls after rain.  And no good restaurant should even have the audacity to serve something like that.

On to why it's not a one star review:
- Prime Rib cooked to perfection
- Pasta bar that has a super nice chef ready to take your order.  (He also makes good basic pastas.)
- Dessert bar to die for: Creme Brulee, Ice Cream Bar, Crisp-on-the-outside soft-on-the-inside cookies. more Creme Brulee, Oreo Pudding Shooters, Tropical Carrot Cake, and did I mention the Creme Brulee.

I don't care for Alaskan King Crab legs, but they have those as well.  I didn't have any of their Mexican or Indian wares, since I know I can get those on the cheap when I go home.  I mean chips, salsa, and guac is what you have for Mexican.  Really?  For a weekday dinner where I spend thirty dollars for a good meal, that money should have just gone to a sit down restaurant with a prix fixe meal.  That probably would have been more satisfying.",1,1,1

My favorites were definitely the breakfast selections .. cute little baskets with waffles & french toast!! I thought some of the other delicious items were the blueberry blintz, the side of mashed potatoes & gravy, and general so's chicken & fried rice. The dessert selections were delicious as well, especially the panna cotta!

The services was spot on during the time we were eating. We got drink refills in a timely manner, our plates were cleared off our table while we got up to get another plate, and for what we received, we thought the buffet was very fairly priced.

This is the king of buffets. I've never seen such a big buffet in my life. 
We came here on Monday for brunch. The fee was $22.99  for two hours of unlimited food. If you wanted unlimited mimosas, bloody marys, and champagne for extra $16.99 extra, though.
 
Honestly, it was worth every penny.

I think you need to go on an empty stomach in order to enjoy everything lol.

It's so amazing how they have multiple sections for different foods all over the world. Some of the sections are Mediterranean, Asian, Latin and Italian. They also have seafood, desserts....honestly, anything you can think of they had it. 

The craziest thing I saw that made me label them the king of buffets was that they had two specific items one was corn- Mexican style with mayo and cheese. I honestly never seen a buffet have something so specific and authentic. Another was red velvet pancakes- with nutella. 

What I also like about the buffet that it is very spacious and you never had to wait to get anything! 

Our server was also very sweet and attentive.

What I saw was something spectacularly presented. The price was out of my range at the time, but I had budgeted to attend for this year's visit. Unfortunately, the presentation wasn't nearly as good. What happened? Not only were the dishes plain, but there were crumbs and sauces spilled everywhere. Many of the nameplates above the food weren't there and some were mislabeled. I had to ask a few times to figure out what something was. Another disappointment was when I frequented the Chinese section's ""Dim Sum"" area, many of the bamboo steamers were empty. I checked about 5 times during the span of an hour, and they were out each time. What can make this worse was that a lady behind the dessert section, who was having a bad day, snapped at me for waiting for her to put the food out. At this point, Aria deserved a 1 star from me.

Fortunately, the dishes I sampled were outstanding. The chow fun and fried rice in the Chinese section were very authentic and had great ""wok-hay."" This translates from Chinese as ""captured flavor by the high-heat from a seasoned wok."" The tender roast beef was cooked perfectly with small sections of fat attached for flavor. One my favorite items I indulged were Italian large shrimps meant as a pasta topping. I just ate them by themselves. The shrimp was cleaned well, cooked to the right temperature, contained lots of meat, and smothered in a heavenly butter sauce. I had a good waitress and the few dishes I had made it worth coming. In the future, I will probably not return since there are other good buffets to try in Vegas for approximately the same price.",0,0,0

Over fried and probably double fried since they were hard as a rock and not juicy and tender. Mexican? Another meh... Prime Rib was decent. Having lived in the Midwest.

First of all, they don't have a wide variety of foods at all compared to some of the other better Vegas buffets... All of the food is categorized, which made it easy to find everything, but there wasn't a big selection in each category. I found the foods I tried to be OK, but nothing amazing. I had the Indian, Mexican, Japanese, and ""American"" foods (sweet potatoes, casserole), but nothing really stood out. The dim sum was dried out, and the Indian food wasn't very authentic tasting. Some of the foods weren't even hot, just warm. The desserts were pretty good, but the ""gelato"" was really just regular ice cream that you can buy in the supermarket. The worst part was the service... our server brought us each one drink and when we immediately finished them (they give you TINY glasses!!) she avoided eye contact and rushed by us many times, until I literally had to grab her sleeve to ask for another drink. She seemed annoyed that I was asking for a refill. They also didn't come by often enough to take our plates, which is a given at a buffet! We paid $45 each (with taxes and tip) which did not seem worth it... the taste and quality just did not measure up. I don't know how this buffet stays in business.

I agree with the others who have said that Aria is a 5 star resort and this buffet is very disappointing. It is NOT what you'd expect after spending time in the rest of Aria.

You'd expect a brand new, snazzy hotel to wow you with a marvelous buffet...it was mediocre at best.

My worst experience was getting burned by a VERY hot metal serving spoon right in front of a server, dropping it, and him giving me a condescending look. Really? 

The waitress tried to get us drunk by putting 3\/4 champagne in our mimosas...it's not bad, but I'd like to also taste the orange juice.

Food included Asian, Mexican, breakfast and roast beef with the works. There were no tags or signs, since they hand write it on the glass covers...hope you can read their writing. 

And as for the dessert? 3 kinds of oatmeal cookies, chocolate whoopie (tasteless) pie, flan, and ice cream. I read the desserts were amazing.........where have people been comparing these to, hometown buffet? They were, at most, subpar.

Going in at the tail end of breakfast into lunch is the best, Thurs\/Fri brunch would still be an acceptable price.  Anything beyond the $24.95 they charge for that, and it's not worth it.  That's mostly because the variety of food isn't nearly as impressive as the other big buffets - it's completely dwarfed by Studio B at the M Resort, and probably the Wynn and Bellagio buffets as well (but I've been to neither of those and can't say for sure).

We got in towards the tail end of breakfast.  For some reason, the switchover was extremely late, I don't think it started flipping until past noon.  That turned out to be a blessing, as some of their breakfast items were pretty nice - eggs benedict and omelette bar were my favorites.  The brisket at lunch was pretty dang good too.  Avoid most of the Asian food and especially the sushi, I remember those seeming like they were lifted right out of a $10 asian buffet.  Remember to save room for dessert, those were not bad. 

The designers did a great job with the dining room - the lighter colors and big windows really help the airy atmosphere,  It's much nicer than the Wicked Spoon's totally enclosed, black and orange motif.
