This time I took advantage of the suite upgrade promotion.  For $104 I got a suite.  The room was nice and spacious.  The bathroom was nicely appointed, and quite large.  My only issue with the room was the couch in the living space was an odd shape that made sitting on it awkward.

I made a reservation from 2\/21 to 2\/23 for my sister's bachelorette weekend. Reservations were easy to make and the person I spoke with was great. Unfortunately, there was a death in the family and we were unable to go on this trip :( :( :(

BUT, when I called the hotel and explained to them this madness, they were very understanding and gave me my full refund back on my deposit, despite the 48 hour cancellation notice requirement. I told the person I spoke with on the phone how deeply grateful I was for this understanding and would return when I come out next time. Now this is great customer service!!

The $15 resort fee is ridiculous .

The check-in lobby is very bright and airy, the dealers are friendly, and the rooms are nice.  On the few occasions that I have been invited to check-in at the VIP lounge behind the double doors, it is by far the nicest check-in area that I have been to.  The service reps are dressed in jacket and skirts, and they are super polite.

The big draw in the summer is the pool, and here's something worth mentioning: not even the Four Seasons guests get pool privileges at Mandalay Bay.  The wave pool definitely seems to be the most crowded.  If you time it right and swim hard, you definitely can get a free push down 1\/2 the length of the pool.  Or, you can swim in the lazy river and feel like you are as fast as an Olympic swimmer.  

The one weakness at Mandalay Bay is the food.  I've eaten at Raffles, the Noodle Shop, Red White & Blue, and the buffet, and none of those meals were particularly memorable.  The Strip Steak restaurant is kind of a splurge place for me at nearly $90-$100 per head, but it was quite good.

Parking is quite a bit better now that they installed those clever escalators in the structure.  If you're driving from Los Angeles, the Frank Sinatra exit practically brings you to the doorstep of Mandalay Bay without making unnecessary turns towards the Strip.

Boy what a nightmare. We paid over $600 dollors for two nights and expected great service, but we got motel 6 type service or worse. First our room was dirty, the bedstand the table and the phone was sticky, and never cleaned. We didn't complain thinking they will come and clean it the next day. We politely asked them to clean the sticky stuff and bring us new towels and do general housecleaning. When we got to our room, the new towels were on the dirty unmade bed. The old towels were still on the floor. So basically they just threw new towels on our bed and left. We still didn't complain. What really made me mad was that the room that cost $600 dollors was nothing more than a junky ass room. When I flushed the toilet it made jet airplane sound letting everyone know in the building that I'm taking a dump. How classy. On top of that I couldn't sleep due to wind noises. Everytime a wind blew you can hear it loudly inside. With all this we still didn't complain. What broke the camels back was at the pool restraunt. We ordered our food to go but decided to stay and eat. We were told by the hostess that we were not allowed to eat in the restraunt even though we paid for the food. My wife politely said we will order more food. She said I understand but this is our policy. You can't eat to go food in the restraunt. We said but we bought the food from your restraunt. She said sorry that's hotel policy. So we bought food from their restraunt, and offered to buy more food, but was told that we couln't eat in the restraunt. So here we are, tired and hungry standing near the restraunt arguing with the rude hostess.  
  Finally at checkout the they asked us about our stay. We said we were very disappointed. She replied ""oh"" .  Why ask when you don't care.  
 The next night we went to LA. And stayed at a hotel for the same price as Mandalay Bay. Guess what, we got clean rooms, the beds were made, the towels clean, and the staff was excellent., and they actually let us eat in the restraunt.

We booked through Southwest Airlines and their vacation package, and it was a pretty good price for what you got.

Check in was easy. We got to our room - it's a king room. We booked a double queen.

We got moved, to the infamous room 11111. (I had to put that in there)

Sweet, everything's good now. Room was decent. There is a minibar with snacks in the room, which, like every other hotel, is ridiculously expensive.

On-site Starbucks (rather the 3 of them on site) charges about $5 for a cup of coffee, so that's cool.

It's a HUGE complex, with a large gaming floor and you'll get lost real quick. I got my bearings after the first night. It gets easy later on.

If you have an M life card, that'll get you a discount at their restaurants (and the other MGM restaurants throughout Vegas), and it's a fairly significant discount, so get that.

There's a tram that takes you between here, the Luxor, and the Excalibur, and from the Excalibur there's a skywalk that can take you to NY NY, MGM Grand, and Tropicana.

Staff was nice, and everything was great.

4 stars, however, because the pool was ridiculously busy at literally every time of day. It's full of kids. I never used it.

I would probably recommend staying more center strip, somewhere in between Planet Hollywood and Wynn. That's where all the shopping and ""fun"" stuff happens.

So of course, my last memories of Vegas included playing at the arcade in Excalibur and seeing the tigers at the Mirage. I figured that I should go big after such a long hiatus and take full advantage of my 21+ status. Searched through Yelp, of course, and found this hotel to be the safest bet. Fairly priced rooms, nothing cheesy or corny, close enough to the Strip to walk to but far enough to get away from the craziness if needed.

Check-in was a little rough because I had to ask about the tickets that I booked in my reservations (note: AFTER they finished everything and gave me all the information and assumed they were done with me). Apparently, I had to go to the Box Office to find out about my tickets. A little unsettling not knowing if I even had tickets. Didn't realize I got a room upgrade until we walked into our room. Yay! Surprises!

Overall, I personally enjoyed my stay in Vegas and in the hotel. Lost some money, drank a little, sight-see'd (is that a word?). I found myself wanting to just explore the hotel more than the Strip. Why? Maybe it's the cheapskate in me that wants to make sure I get my money's worth. Maybe the hotel actually had things worth checking out.

Upon arrival we were greeted with a ridiculous line where we waited for over 30 minutes to get checked in.  It looked like there was a convention that week that we weren't aware of.  

The receptionist was friendly and we had a quick check-in. She even upgraded my room to the Sky Suite which made my trip even sweeter!!  The suite was very spacious with a guest restroom, kitchen with a wet bar, coffee maker and fridge overlooking a large living room which had nice modern furnishings. The bedroom was spacious as well with a comfortable king size bed and the bathroom came with a large tub, walk-in shower, and a double sink vanity with an embedded TV.  This was a luxurious moment for me.

Only thing that didn't work was one of the lamps next to my bed.

The casino area seemed very empty, hardly anyone was gambling or on the floor.  MB could really update their main public area for a nicer user experience with the interior environment.

My sister and I stayed here for convenience because our friends were getting married at the chapel. It has been over 3 weeks since our stay and I would have posted sooner, but I wanted to give Mandalay Bay a chance to respond, but I have yet to hear from them. Let me give you my back story and you'll understand why I'm so upset. 

We check in and we are given a room on the 13th floor. BOOM, I should have known to ask for a different floor right off the bat! I've been told stories about avoiding the 13th and even 12th and 14th floors in hotels because of all the bad luck associated with the number 13. Unfortunately, I didn't feel like being picky (which is completely unlike me!) and decided to go with the flow. #1 rule - always stick to your gut feeling!!! I'm still kicking myself over it. Anyway...

After checking in, my sis and I head down to the pool area, super excited because everyone we spoke to gave such rave reviews about their lazy river. We were thoroughly disappointed as the lazy river seemed much smaller than expected. To our dismay, we had to pay for the inner tubes at $20 a pop! It's hard to relax when you and 50 other kids\/guests are trying to do the same thing and all getting elbows to the face. We spent an hour at the pool and headed back to our room. 

We ate a late dinner, again at MB (we just kept giving them our money!), and my sis opens her purse to pay and sees none of her cash that she brought for the trip and wedding gift to her best friend, the bride. I remain calm and am convinced my sis misplaced it in our room so we hurry back and comb the place three times, but didn't find it. I still remained calm and said it must be in the car so we go there and comb it several times and still NO CASH anywhere. We go back to the room and check it again and again and my sis starts retracing her steps. She did not open her purse at all that day until we were paying dinner. She left her purse in our room while we went to the pool and we were only gone for an hour. We thought, maybe she got pick-pocketed? But the cash was in a zippered pocket and covered by the front flap of her purse with a magnetic closure so she would have definitely felt someone reach into her bag. The only other logical explanation is that someone came into our room while we were at the pool and stole it.

We go to the front desk and report the incident to security who said that Risk Management will investigate (who, BTW, is closed on weekends - I DON'T KNOW WHY this dept. is closed on weekends when I'm assuming a lot of stuff gets stolen during this time more so than during the week). Security tells us that it should take about 2-3 days and we should call Risk Management for an update. The Security Guard also mentioned that often the hotel will provide some sort of compensation or etc. to help with these kinds of situations. It was already almost 2am by the time we were done so I waited until the morning. I go back to the front desk and explain what happened to a manager, who although was very nice, only offered to change our rooms. I repeated that this was our first time staying here, our friends are getting married here, we definitely do not feel safe staying here, etc. Look, I wasn't trying to take advantage of this horrible situation. All I was trying to get across was it's difficult to have a great time after our money gets stolen on the first night of what was supposed to be a weekend of celebrating our friends' wedding. We would have appreciated more customer service being that it was our first time staying here. Really, anything would have made us feel better. A dinner to one of the restaurants within MB, tickets to a show...come on, MB! You could have done a much better job taking care of your customers!

I called Risk Management the Wednesday after our stay and it seems like only ONE person works there and she's always away from her desk! I left a couple voicemails asking them to call me back on Wednesday and Thursday and she finally calls me back on Friday. She leaves a voicemail saying they are still investigating if anyone went into our room, but proceeds to explain that Nevada State law says that no compensation can be given because the hotel provides safes in each room. So then what is the freaking point of investigating if nothing will come out of it??? And yes, like I said, I waited over three weeks to post a review and have yet to receive a call from Risk Management with an update. 

Needless to say, I have told EVERYONE I KNOW about what happened and how poorly Mandalay Bay handled this situation and now everyone who uses Yelp knows. 

Mandalay Bay - I hope you read this review and actually respond. I got multiple emails after our stay asking me to complete a survey, which I completed 2 weeks ago asking for someone to contact me and still no one has. No response is a response. Thanks for nothing!",4,3,1

Maybe it was because the room was HUGE. Or the fact that there were two sinks in the bathroom, the deep bathtub (which my nieces loved!) or the super hot water in the shower. It was perfect for a night away from home.

The hotel was so clean and nice, it didn't smell like smoke either, like most LV hotel's do.

I also left LV with cash in my pocket, came out ahead, so that helps too. I am a bit sad that their room prices are so high next month because of spring break, because I really wanted to go back soon. My room for the night with taxes, fees and their resort fee was a total of $120. Which I thought was really great.

I was able to play the tables for a long time, the beer service was a bit slow, but that's ok. Also, there weren't a bunch of creepy guys trying to hit on me either so that was good.

Cost a ton of $$$ to take out cash, $4-6 per transaction, so be prepared when you get there.

The rooms are fine.  They're clean enough for picky hotel folks.  The housekeeping did great - I left a $10 bill every day and it seemed to do the trick, as the room was in great shape every afternoon when we returned to it.

I was upgraded to a suite, which was very nice. However, I found the contemporary styled furniture not to my taste and somewhat uncomfortable. The bed, however, was divine. I appreciated the plethora of charger options at the desk and the fact that wifi is free. The shower ran hot water only intermittently; it took a long time to warm up, then cooled as I washed up. I was pleased to find a Keurig in the room, but rankled at paying $4.00 for one K-cup, a paper cup, and some sweeteners I didn't use. I suppose this is to be expected in Las Vegas. The coffee shop downstairs offered a large cup of Delano blend for $5.00 - a much better value and a decent cup of joe.

I'm not a gambler, so cannot offer any feedback on the casino. There are a plethora of dining options and even a tattoo parlor just of the casino floor should you get the urge to get inked.

At the far end of the strip, so you have a short ride to the airport but if you want to hotel hop you'll need a cab or figure out your walking and tram rides.  They do have a bridge of shops to the Luxor which is cool as well as a tram to the Excalibur where you can walk over to NY NY or MGM Grand - where you can get the monorail to the rest of the hotels on that side of the strip.  Mandalay is a destination, they have one of the largest convention centers so they book a lot of conventions, rates jump up when there is a convention in the hotel so watch the rates before you book   You'll appreciate that they pump in pure oxygen scented with vanilla on the main casino level - very calming and hides the smoke you get hit with in most other places in Vegas.  It's a HUGE property so you'll get your walking done for sure, and with tons of rooms there are tons of people so if you want to go to their sand beach wave pool, get there early as the lounge chairs fill up quickly and they run out of lockers early for stuff.

Do not stay here IF you are planning to go clubbin at XS, Surrender, Tao, MArquee, etc. Even though it is on othe trip, it is still way too far for you ladies to walk, unless you want to spend money ($$$) on the cabs. This hotel is more like a resort.

Nice and clean and new amenities.  If you want to come and relax at the resort, this is a great place to stay!  They also have many pools, including a lazy river.  Just a note:  they charge a $15 resort fee. 

Check in time is after 3 pm but if there's room available, they will let you check in.  Check out time is 11 am but you can request to check out later at noon if desired.


There's also a tram from Mandalay Bay that goes through Luxor and to Excalibur. (save you the walk but it is nice to walk through the hotels and see all the shops and pass by some of the exhibits.

It's supposed to be one of the higher-end hotel on the Strip, but this was my second stay there in a few months, and wow...not good. I will say a lot of this wasn't addressed because I was there only for a night, but had I stayed longer, I would have taken housekeeping and management to task over what I found lacking.

However, that shouldn't deter from the fact that these were problems that weren't addressed before I checked into the room.

At check-in, though the gal was efficient, rude and cold much? Barely looking up from the computer, she barely exuded the ""welcome"" Mandalay Bay prides itself on.

Getting to the room, and wow, I was kinda disgusted. Housekeeping is apparently not a priority for the hotel anymore. Why are there rust stains around the fixtures? Why were the bulbs flickering on and off like they were about to die and not replaced immediately? Why were there stray hairs from the previous guests in the sink and shower? The best part? The water didn't drain in the shower. Gross.

I checked out the next morning, a long line of people waiting to check out. Despite the fact that the line was growing, the number of people at the front desk didn't change.

So then, my turn. I was not asked how my stay was, how my room was and if I was satisfied - which I found weird, considering every 3-star plus hotel front desk staff ask. Sure, he might have been harried because of the number of people trying to check out, but how is that my fault? I had to tell him the problems I encountered in my room. His response? ""Oh, thanks for letting me know."" Not even an apology on behalf of the hotel.

Definitely not what I expect when staying at a high-end hotel. Believe me, I didn't expect free night or a discount or anything, I did however, expect (at a minimum) ""I'm so sorry about that. I hope you'll come visit us again soon and experience something better."" But, no.

What's funny is that I got a survey a few days later asking about my experience. I debated filling it out, since I know they're rarely looked at and only want to highlight the positive things said about their properties. So, instead, decided to vent about it here.

Needless to say, there are plenty of other high-end hotels along the Strip, and I will most likely stay there from now on unless forced to stay at Mandalay. Also, as the head hotel coordinator for various trade shows and events for work? Mandalay Bay won't be on my list.",9,1,1

It's definitely one of the nicer hotels on the strip and compares to other fancy resorts such as the Bellagio and Wynn.  If you're looking to take it up a notch, you can book a room at THE Hotel.  Attached to the resort, THE Hotel offers an all-suites hotel with upgraded amenities and separate luxury spa called ""The Bathhouse.""  Want to take it up another notch above that? The Four Seasons Hotel is located on the top four floors of the Mandalay Bay, with a separate entrance and pool.

The rooms are nice and well appointed with huge bathrooms and nice amenities. There's a wide range of rooms available from the normal deluxe rooms to the Four Seasons Presidential Suite so it really caters to a wide variety of clientele.  The casino floor is extensive with more tables and slot machine than you can throw money at.  It's a nicer hotel so don't expect any $5 minimum tables here.

By far the best thing about this place is the pool area, or as they call it, ""The Beach.""  It's called the beach because it comes complete with sand, a wave pool, lazy river and plenty of separate pools for adults and kids. They even hold outdoor concerts at the Beach during the summer season and it's really an experience not to be missed.  Where else can you see a concert on the beach for $30?  The Beach is massive and there's plenty of room to lay out, gamble, drink and socialize with your friends.  Other things to do at the Mandalay Bay include the Shark Reef Aquarium and the Michael Jackson ONE show (powered by Cirque Du Soleil).

The Mandalay Bay is one of my favorite resorts on the strip.  Most hotels in Vegas charge a resort fee nowadays and the Mandalay Bay is not exempt from that.  The $25\/day fee gives you internet and access to the resort gym. The only negative about this place is the location.  It's located on the far south end of the strip so you basically have to drive everywhere. If you don't have a car, be prepared to fork out plenty of money for cab fare.  But other than that, I love this place.

First of al this place is ENORMOUS and, as I've been to several different events there, know that it does get easier to find your way every time .

The food is great anywhere you eat - since I was there for 4 nights I mixed it up and was never displeased. There also seems to be many traps on any given attempt to leave the hotel....but they were great, lively spots to stop for a drink or just some entertainment.  

A must, should you have the opportunity, is the Foundation Room.  The food - mmmm...my event was completely catered with incredible delicacies from Asian delectables, ribs, shrimp, and more to a the most lavish spread of goodies waiting to be dunked in the towering chocolate fountain.  Then there is the view......that's all that needs to be said...the view.  Comfortable nooks and rooms of historical enchantment suck you in and forbid you to leave.

For the VH1 Rock Honors Awards, the convention area was perfect.  But it was a bit of a hike so wear comfy shoes.

It was a great place for my corporate convention, save the ventilation system just outside the meeting room which failed to absorb the tons of smoke expelled by my jonsing colleagues on break.  The smoke seeped into the rooms and clung on dearly, giving me a major allergic reaction typically void in even the densest of cigar smoke ridden lounges.  They didn't do much with the meeting rooms even during award dinners - which kind of surprised me but I suppose they want bore you into the casino!

We only came to Mandala to look at the shark reef. My mom has congestive heart failure and can't walk far. Our cab attempted to bring us to the closest door. On listening to the reason, 3 parking attendants let us through. Then we encountered Michael - dirty yellow hoody, bad attitude. He continued to yell at our cab driver and refused to listen to any of us. We ended up at the normal taxi drop off. My mom made it about 1\/2 way to the reef, then we were forced to leave her on a bench and go on without her. Disappointing since a bit of compassion on Michael's part would have created a whole different ending.",3,3,3

I've stayed at both The Hotel and the Spa Suites on their good deals they offer. The Hotel could be a little bigger in space even though they're suites. It's a small living room but a spacious room and restroom. The Spa Suites were to me bigger and nice for the price we paid. The hotel itself is nice with having their own sports betting area and shopping. The ventilation in this hotel is good especially when you don't smell a lot of cigarettes around. Definitely not dirty and clean here in both the rooms and the casino area. Downsides are it being far from the main strip area so taking a taxi can be quite more expensive than other hotels and the swimming area isn't as big and can get crowded during the weekends.,1,0,1

They already force a ""resort fee"" which whether you use those amenities or not, you're charged the fee as a mandatory cost, which is odd in that if that's the case, why don't they just roll that price into the room rate (I know why 'tho, it's for marketing and perception of a lower rate that ends up increasing).

Here's my rundown 


GOOD 1:  the valet is awesome.  They're fast and professional.  I've always used the valet here and never had as much as a scratch on my car or a dime missing from my change pocket. 

GOOD 2:  the rooms are nice and clean.   They're average sized but setup well.  Housekeeping does a great job ""resetting"" the room so it's always exactly the same and always clean. 

GOOD 3:  The casino is decent sized.  It's not massive but it's not small either.  The dealers are very friendly and helpful.  Your luck is what it is so don't expect anything more than average payouts. Drink , relax , and have a good time. 

GOOD 4:  The pools are great.  The all ages pool has a real beach and a lazy river for floating.  The adult pool ""Light Day Club"" is really fun.  We saw Krewella there twice. 

BAD 1:  There's only one club on the property and it's a little small.  

Overall it's a great place to stay and the rates are reasonable.   It's not as party party as some others but it's still fun just in a more mellow way.",2,0,0

You walk out of the elevators to your hallway and don't get that awful smoke stench. The room is a good size with a large bathroom which is great when traveling with the ladies, specially when you're all trying to get ready at the same time.

I liked that this hotel breaks up the elevators by floors. If I remember correctly they're broken up by twenty floors and each section has eight elevators. You never find yourself waiting very long for one like you do at other hotels. 

If you're looking to just stay, relax and never leave your hotel you can do it here. The Mandalay is just like a little city with two Starbucks on the books. Buffets, restaurants, clubs and a free tram to neighboring Luxor and Excalibur which you can also get there on foot via the connecting bridge ways.

More then anything this place is clean. The room gets services and you can tell it's been serviced. Nice clean, and crisp towels, that don't gross you out.

Sure, this is after a one night stay at the 4 Seasons, which is technically the same building, but the condition of the rooms is drastically different.

The first room we had at Mandalay had an impressive view. We later had to change rooms because there was a distinct smell of smoke in the bathroom which is covered by the smell of a ""baby powder"" scent of perfume. I'm highly allergic, so we made a call to the front desk to change rooms.

The second room was on the 4th floor and we lost the view we originally had. Furniture layout in this room was a little weird, in that they had a desk pulled over to these low couch, so it's not exactly a coffee table. Nevermind though. We still smelled a bit of smoke in the bathroom, but honestly, I didn't want to through the ordeal of changing rooms again. Maybe it's their ventilation system?

Bathroom amenities are ok. Decent shower. I could really do without the window to the bathroom.

Otherwise, hotel amenities are ok. We visited the pool but didn't get a chance to use it, but the entire pool\/beach area was impressive.

I did partake in the spa services which wasn't bad. This might have been one of my favorite parts of the trip. I only wish I had more time in the steam room and sauna before my massage. Spa services are a bit expensive. Overall, if I had to rate the spa area on cleanliness on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being low, 5 being high), I'd give it a 4. The spa hosts are friendly and helpful.

Despite the location of the hotel being on the south side of the strip, there was still a lot of hotel guests. This kinda drove me nuts, but it could also be that most people were there for March Madness. Honestly, the location doesn't really seem to make it much quieter, so I might opt to stay somewhere more North which is more within walking distance. 

Overall, this hotel was ok. It's starting to seem a bit dated but it's not old like Luxor or Excalibur. I think I'm going to stay elsewhere in the future.",1,0,0

The second day, we were moved to a 'better' room after making this request of the front desk when we took a look at our first room.

The cabana staff are wonderful. 

Monday through Wednesday the pools were remarkably uncrowded. 

Breakfasts at the Veranda were quite good. 

The housekeeping staff left the gross nylon bedspread and shams in the closet, where we had stowed them, instead of putting them back on the bed each morning.   Yay. 

The hotel contacted me through Yelp regarding my initial review. 

The Bad
The food in the restaurants we tried (except the Veranda) was mediocre to bad; Border Grill, Raffles, pool side cafe. 

The first night there was no hot water flowing from any of the faucets in the bathroom.  

The mattress transfers the slightest movement to the other person.  It makes me wish I had settled for the 2 queens they tried to make us take when we checked in, even though we made reservations for a King size bed months ago.  The pillows are lumpy, synthetic poly-fill.  

The Ugly
After contacting me through my Yelp review and asking me to reply, the hotel made no attempt to respond to my follow up reply.  This makes me wonder if their first response was not sincere and instead was intended just for show to Yelp readers.  What do you think?  

Life guards allow people to block the access and egress from the pools.  Anyone needing to use the handrail is simply out of luck.  Isn't this a safety violation?  It is so disrespectful of people with mobility issues. The only option is to ask people to move to the other side of the stairs or to move their chairs back from the edge of the pool deck. Guests should not be put in this uncomfortable position.  The hotel staff bear the responsibility to ensure safe access and egress, not the guests. 

The Just Plain Disgusting
 I know Las Vegas has a live and let live approach and I appreciate this.  Should there be health standards though?  Here's what I mean:

The life guards let people eat and drink in the pools and lazy river. Yuck. 

There don't appear to be any rules restricting babies wearing diapers in the pools. Triple yuck.",4,2,1

Other then the great food we had at the cafe, this place is a must miss. The rooms were old and outdated. I upgraded to a suite being that it was our anniversary and it was no better then a regular room. Old furniture, In room safe that was broken, hard stiff beds and sheets, lights that didn't work and that were missing knobs to turn them on. Bathroom trim around vanity was coming apart. There was a huge rip in the carpet outside our room. The front desk staff was rude and not much help of any kind.

I just wish the rooms were on the same level of beauty. I felt like I was staying at an average hotel but paying 5x the price!

CONS
-It took an hour to check in because only two people were working. I would think more than two employee's would have been on shift in the afternoon.

- The room (regular with two queen beds) was small and dirty. There appeared to be a small amount of blood on the wall next to the bed that ran up to the ceiling. It looked like it had not been dusted in a long time. Light switches, counters, doors, door knobs, mirrors were all dirty. The tub had hairs in it. The beds\/ pillows obviously hadn't been changed because there were hairs on the pillow and bed sheets! The comfoter sheet also had many stains and what looked like blood on it as well (it was reddish but it could have been anything)

- Whenever the AC was turned on it emitted a very high pitched squeaky noise from it for about 10 minutes.

- I was surprised that no hand soap was provided... I did get a facial soap bar and just used that.

- The doors to the bathroom were REALLY hard to close and were VERY loud when opening\/closing.

- There was no in room fridge or coffee maker. (I understand you can pay extra for a fridge, I was just disappointed it didn't have one)

- The internet sucked after the first day because I didn't realize until my 2nd to last day there that you had to re log in every time you disconnect from the WiFi.

- There was a VERY loud fire alarm that went off around 8am....Called guest services to inquire and was put on hold for 10 minutes and then told ""It was just a test.""

- Make sure not to EVER open the mini fridge. Everything sits on a sensor so if you move something (even if you put it back and don't use it) you WILL be charged. They do mention this in their pamphlet but still it sucks.

- The sink would make random gurgling noises at night sometimes. It was really annoying and disturbing.

-The toilet was CRAZY powerful. Make sure you close the lid or you WILL get sprayed (but even with it closed it still sprays so try not to stand too close).

-I was there to attend an outside wedding and apparently the hotel had booked a private party with band and they decided to rehearse when the couple was saying their vows. :(

-The $25 resort fee per day was ridiculous.


PROS
-The view which overlooked the pools. That was gorgeous.

- The Monorail was convenient to go between hotels and gain access to the strip.

-They gave us a bottle of water as we were standing in line waiting to check in.

- The inside of the hotel was very, very beautiful. They even had an exotic fish tank near the check in desk. (I just wished the rooms exhibited the same amount of beauty that the hotel lobby does.)

-The employees were friendly (with the exception of the lady who answered about the fire alarm. She had a bit of an attitude but she probably had everyone in the hotel calling about the alarm...) Concierge helped with some questions I had and were friendly. 

-The included sewing kit in the bathroom was a nice touch! Very handy.

-The mini TV in the bathroom was cool. You could watch TV while taking a bath.

Overall one star for the nice employees and one star for the great view. However, I would not recommend this hotel to future guests unless you get a REALLY good deal. For the price (normally) you could stay at a nicer hotel.",4,0,0

I'm one of those who is here from the northwest to get some warmth and let my kiddo have a weekend at the poolthis summer before she is back to school. Pools are her kryptonite. She loves wave pools,but ouch - we get here and find out she is 2"" short to even go in it!  The waves are strong but come SO far apart I don't see the issue if a parent is present and we stay shallow. 

OUCH!  Getting to the pool was an issue, we parked our stuff on what may have been the last chair and my Kiddo took off to run to the pool. She got about 8 feet and screamed bloody murder - and my kid doesn't scream.  I ran to Her and scooped her up in my arms and realized why, the sand is like fire. Literally!!!  Our feet were in such pain we had to sit awhile with a towel on the sand to let our feet rest until it feel better enough to walk. It caused my feet to crack badly which now means I'm basically limping around for our vacation weekend.  There should be signs or some information right when you walk in about NOT walking in the sand barefoot in the summer unless it's night time.   

We had a hard time finding chairs not in the sand... Lots of unused cabanas but they aren't in this single moms budget, but if you have a large group -get one!  Im trying to give my daughter a wonderful weekend but her complaining her feet hurt when she walks (and she's not a complainer) wasn't on the agenda  Was planning on doing the shark reef but since my newly burned blistered cracked feet make it hard to walk i think we need to change plans.

They probably have the  most pools aside from Caesar but unlike MB, Caesar just has a bunch of pools over a large area. MB has different pool areas over the entire property, some of which include a wave pool, lazy river, and a topless area. 
Aside from all their pools, they have many restaurants to choose from and to be honest, it gets a little tiring to walk from one area of MB to another because there's so many restaurants and pools on the property. However, they have dozens to choose including Aureole, Citizens, Fleur, and the House of Blues, just to name a few. 
MB isn't really the place the place to shop but I do believe they have a shopping mall. Why spend any more money when you can roll over to the Shark Reef Aquarium. From what I recall, hours run from 10 am to 10 pm.

For the amount of rooms and towers they have, there is only one set of elevators that ride up and down the center of the hotel. These elevators go from pool level all the way to the top of the hotel. It's really annoying when you stay at the pool til closing time and have to wait 30+ minutes in line for the elevator. Sundays are the worst when you wait for an elevator after check-out and realize that every one that stops is already full of people and their luggage. If you're on a lower level, you're screwed.

On the bright side, the pool is pretty amazing (except for the $20 inner tube rental). I suggest hitting walmart beforehand and buying a cheap tube and just bringing it in. I like that Mandalay is attached to a shopping area. The stores aren't bad. Def not as fancy as the forum shops at CP, and not as hip as the miracle mile shops at PH.

This is actually my first time staying at the Mandalay Bay. i have only been here once since it is at the end of the strip. i remember coming here for the -5 degree ice bar once and for sushi. LOL 

this hotel is such a huge maze! since i have a bad sense of direction i tend to get lost. the convention center is FAR from the hotel! every day that i was there i had to walk a long walk from and to the convention center. and since there was 3 conferences happening that weekend, the lines to starbucks every morning extended out the door (there's no door...). 

i seriously did not step out of Mandalay Bay at all. i had everything right in front of me. there was the mini mall if i walk to the other side of the convention center. There was a buffet if i wanted to eat a buffet. mini lounges that everyone goes to right after the conference. 

my room was alright. i was in there for less than 24 hours. barley stayed in my room. Free Wi-fi is always a plus! the mini bar prices are super ridiculous! tv channels were lame. the room and bathroom was clean which i like a lot. when i requested for an early check out because i didn't know i had the room for an extra day -- they didn't tell me over the phone when i called them that i would like a late check out. so i'm rushing down in the morning to move my stuff downstairs to check out before i head to the conference. and right when i got to the desk -- the guy tells me that i had the room for another night. GREAT! so i had to move my stuff back to my room and run to the conference. SHEESH!

great place for conventions and everything is super pricey. a bottle of water is $3 -- then again.. its VEGAS!!",1,0,0

It is located at the south edge of the Strip. We rented a car, so it was not a problem. If you don't have a car, it may be.

Still, this hotel offers lots of fun. The restaurants are decent and Lion King was very good, though you don't have to stay in the hotel to take advantage of them. But among all, I love their pools and that is the reason why I always come back to this hotel!

This was my first time staying at a hotel in Vegas so I don't have much to base my opinion on.  I travel a lot for a living and do spend a lot of time in hotels.

I thought Mandalay Bay was beautiful.  My room had flat screen TV's in the sleeping portion and bathroom.  The showers are gorgeous and relaxing.  There is a small fridge but you can't put stuff in it because it is stocked with 'for sale' bottles of drinks, in fact we were warned that if you as so touch a bottle in the fridge you may get charged as they have sensors on them that detect if you move any of the items, and of course all items in the fridge were expensive, just like the rest of Vegas.  Since it is towards the end of the Strip there are places where you can get a nice view.  The pool is beautiful to look at but I didn't get a chance to swim in it so I'm not sure of anything beyond the asthetics of it.

The lobby is really gorgeous, and there are good places to eat here such as Wolfgang Puck's restaurant and a nice French cafe.  I have no complaints about anything, but nothing really amazing and special jumps out at me either.  It is a very nice, expensive Vegas hotel.",1,0,1

The casino was a casino but the cocktail waitresses were really friendly and brought me lots of free drinks.  I left with an extra $100 in my pocket (from just slots) so I can't complain!

First, the love:

It's a beautiful resort - it's spacious and smells nice (so you don't feel like you're developing emphysema while walking through the casino). The pool area, Mandalay Beach, is by-far the best in Vegas. The guestrooms are quite spacious as well. The bathroom is huge with a separate toilet room, glass shower stall and large bathtub. The vanity area contained 2 sinks, name brand lotions and such, and a mini sewing kit (how awesome is that!?)! Also, the room's window is not just a window, it's a wall. Great if you want your room sun-kissed during the day or want to check out a great view of the lights at night. Downstairs there's House of Blues and Rum Jungle, two great spots for dining and drinking. Also, if you're into shopping (which I am!) there are a few stores to choose from such as Urban Outfitters and MetroPark. Oh and I can't forget the Starbucks....always a good thing, especially when you're hungover or simply just a feen like me.    

Ok, here's the hate part: 

I frequent vegas a bit too much for my own good (4 times last year, twice this year already). However, each experience is different because I try to go with different people. This time I went with co-workers who got a suite at the adjacent THE Hotel, while I got my own room at Mandalay Bay. So  if all went as planned I would have been checking into my room a little before 3:00pm. However, due to a delayed flight and a much needed meal stop I didn't get to check in until around 6pm, which by that time i was completely exhausted. So I checked in and got my key for my room on the 26th floor. I thought, wow that's great, too bad i'm going to be enjoying it by myself! So I finally get to my room on the 26th floor and lo-and-behold...it's a COMPLETE MESS! The bed is not done, the bathroom has towels all over the floor, and the lights are all on! I was FURIOUS! Here i was at this fancy place and the room they gave me was not ready! I immediately used the room phone to call the front desk. They were very apologetic and said that I can either wait for the room to be done or move to another room on the 6th floor. I told them i'd take the other room, losing the nice view is no big deal. So I asked them if i needed to go back downstairs to pick up my new key, and they said no, that someone would be bringing it to my new room and to just wait there. I thought ok, again, no big deal. Boy was i wrong!  I got to the door of my new room, and since i was SO exhausted by then, I just plopped on the carpet right outside. I waited, and waited and waited and no one came! I called the desk 3 times from my cell phone! Each time they said 'it's on it's way!'..by the 4th time I asked to speak to the manager and told her I had been waiting almost 45 minutes for my damn key for my new room because the stupid hotel gave me a room that wasn't ready. In that time I could've walked down 26 floors to the front desk to get the damn key myself! So..the manager apologized and offered me $100 in credit to use towards any service in the hotel (which i just asked to deduct from my bill) and my key arrived in less than 3 minutes. Whew...

So..yes it's love\/hate..but I'll probably visit again soon. The pool is awesome..and I completely forgot to take the mini-sewing kit with me so I have to go back =)  hah!",0,0,0

The ambiance was nice, sprawling and very easy to walk through.  Definitely did not feel as dense as NYNY and not the low ceilings of Bellagio or Wynn (big dislike).  We've gotten comp room offers here before, but never opted to due to the distance from the rest of the hotels, but I think our August trip will definitely include a few nights here.  It was very nice, didn't pay too bad, and the drinks were delicious.  There wasn't a time the cocktail waitress came by that I didn't order another pina colada.

Great variety for machines, denominations and tables.  We were very pleased and got to play here quite a bit.

We also did some walking around.  Saw the vino tower and definitely put it on our checklist of places to eat next time (I just want to see them scale up\/down).

Will definitely be staying here soon, so hopefully the guest rooms are as 5\/5 as the rest of the place.",1,0,0

Excited that we get a somehow discounted fee as a healthcare employee from work and since I'm aware that hotels like this in Vegas gets booked quickly so i went ahead and booked EARLY, to be specific it was Sep. 13, 2016 and received my confirmation and already took out the total fee from my bank account. On Sept. 19,2016 our employee benefits team emailed me another confirmation number, the one Mandalay Bay use specifically. I thought ok we're good to go.

Oct. 26,2016 the day of our checkin.....the front desk clerk informed me that they RAN OUT OF THE ROOM I BOOKED MORE THAN A MONTH AGO.....which was a King Bedroom.....being it was also my husband's exact birthday i don't want to create a commotion BUT THIS SITUATION REALLY UPSETS ME......I was offered a room with two queen beds.....I composed myself and took a deep breath and told the clerk that i want a room with a great view.....Instead of requesting the Manager's presence and discuss this very irritating experience and maybe demand for two hot chocolates every night until we check out. My husband and I drove 4.5hrs from San Diego, we're tired, we're hungry, and we didn't get the room I booked ahead of time. They didn't even waived our $10\/day parking fee and\/or the $35\/day resort fee that we never used.

So why two stars instead of one? The room they gave us was at the 28th floor giving me the view that could melt my angering and hating heart: The Strip View. City night lights gives this relaxing feeling and yes it's my weakness. Every night we shut off the lights, open the curtains, and view the city lights, that i was not even sure if we'll get from my initially booked room. But the hotel could have supplemented their mess up with more incentives other than a 28th floor room.

I get to the hotel and was told that they sold out of them, but I could pay an additional $70 a night to get a different suite with a view (a view? who cares??). I was given some attitude when I pointed out that my husband and myself were a little disappointed and was told ""sorry, nothing I can do"" by the man at check-in as he handed us the room keys to the room we didn't want. Given that it was a holiday weekend, I figured and it was really busy and everyone is a little on edge, so I didn't stick around to argue with the man. So the weekend goes by with no further issues. *Side note, this hotel was cheap, but not worth paying for the cab rides back and forth to be in the ""action"". I should have stayed somewhere else, but I was with a group and they chose this hotel.* So, when I arrived home I receive an email asking for my review of the hotel. Gladly! I was going to email a complaint anyways! I tell them honestly what had happened and that I was overall a little disappointed with the lack of customer service with my issue. Here is where it gets super annoying. I receive and email back saying I would receive a credit of $325. I am thinking ""WOW this hotel has totally changed my mind! I cannot believe they were going to comp my room! I will definitely stay there again!"" ya...I was thinking that they actually care about their customers' opinions and were legitimately sorry for screwing up our reservation. Maybe they were just busy and the staff was having a bad night when I arrived and it isn't usually so unorganized!  So today I check my credit card balance online and see that I was given a credit of $56. So I call to ask what was going on. 20 minute hold time for disputes. woman transfers me to the hotel guest services. I talk to 2 different people in guest services. 40 minutes later they tell me ""Oops we actually only wanted to credit you $56. Sorry."" The supervisor then hung up on me as I was mid sentence.   I don't know about anyone else, but when it is mid December (holiday season!) and I think am going to be receiving $325 and I only get $56, I am pissed! So now for the moral of this story.

It has good restaurants and entertainment on site and the pool area is incredible. It's a sandy beach which is unique to the strip. I also recommend a trip through the aquarium.

It's the southernmost property on the strip and a bit of a walk to some venues - most cab fares are $10+.

We arrived around noon on Friday July 19th.  Valet parked our vehicle & were able to flag down a bell hop for our luggage.  Check in was a breeze as we only waited in line for maybe 15-20 minutes tops.  While waiting we were greeted with the yummiest little mango flavored cocktails that had a red pepper in the bottom which gave the drink a nice little kick.  Once we got to our room I called Vallet & had our luggage brought up within 5 minutes.  The bell hop was very nice & personable. 
  Unfortunately, our concert was rained out the following night by thunderstorms but I actually enjoyed watching the storm from our room on the 26th floor which had an awesome view of the pool areas & stage.  

 Our room decor was a bit bland and on the contemporary side.  The sofa had a large black stain, possibly shoe shine?  I wasn't too impressed for the price & the AC decided to quit working after only a day so I had to blast the fan for the remainder of our 3 day stay.  Fortunately, we don't spend much time in our room.   Room service was okay to say the least.  My boyfriends breakfast was perfect.  I ordered a simple plain croissant with a side of scrambled eggs & an avocado with olive oil as I have dietary restrictions.  When my food arrived I saw that it was a croissant slathered in cheese, eggs & bacon (gross) and no olive oil for my avocado.  Needless to say I wasn't able to eat much.  I'm not sure what the problem was as I carefully explained to the woman that took our order exactly what I wanted.  We ordered room service again Saturday night & it never even showed up!  Big disappointment there.  

 The shopping is decent if you have $$$ to spend, the pool closes at odd times but is quite nice otherwise.  I would skip Lupo unless you like stale croutons in your Caesar Salad & a server who could care less.  I recommend Aureole, hands down the BEST restaurant there.  Service & food was 100%.  Alfredo (our server) was great!  No complaints what so ever.  

 I would also skip the nightclub scene unless you like that sort of clusterfuckery & check out the House of Blues instead.  They had a great metal show with local bands who were all surprisingly talented.  Whiskey Southern Band was a favorite with us.  

 Make sure to hit up the little Irish Pub upstairs in the shopping area for lunch, great friendly service, great food & appetizers.  
  Checked out Sunday around noon, bell hops & valet were super nice.  Only real negative I have is that upon leaving my bf noticed he had been bitten on the arm by a bed bug (definitive line pattern of 6 bites).  That completely freaked us out & our luggage is still sitting outside.  I had to heat treat all of our belongings when we got home which wasn't fun after traveling for 2 days.",0,0,0

We called down to the desk and asked to be switched rooms only to receive a shrewd ""NO we have nothing available"" No apologies, nothing. They offered to send up an air freshener. AN AIR FRESHENER? Really? Absolutely not. We asked to speak to a manager and got the most short, to the point, almost robotic answers from the most unhelpful and unapologetic manager I have ever come into contact with. We were told ""you can either down grade or deal with it"" um its Vegas there are plenty of rooms, upgrade us... ""no way not a chance"" after going  back and forth with this lady she offered for us to switch rooms the next day but couldn't guarantee a non-smoking room.... THAT WAS THE WHOLE POINT. Then she said they could send someone up to ""purify the air"" but we would have to leave the room for an hour and a half. Grrrrrr..... so we obliged. I can't sleep in a smoke haze. No drink comps while we waited, no pro-rating our room for our time missed, still no apology. All this after an 11 hour drive there.

there was a problem with the shower the first day, then another problem with the shower the next day. i called the following day because the toilet was ALSO having a problem and they sent someone out almost immediately each time, and the person taking the call comped all of our room service for the inconveniences. maybe it wasn't a big deal for them but it was certainly a nice gesture. 

room service was varied, good options for vegetarians, and the belgian waffles were fantastic! i didn't get a chance to hit the pool or the lazy river, much to my dismay...but they were well-kept and i'm bummed i didn't get to indulge. 

we ate at the border grille one night, and i usually find hotel restaurants overpriced and not impressive but i was surprised pleasantly. the menu didn't have anything veg that appealed to me, but the waitress hooked it up and i ended up loving my meal and the drink she suggested-she was great. 

the spa: holy crap! seriously, one of the most beautiful i have been to. there's a hot plunge pool, a cold plunge pool, a giant jacuzzi with like...fish fountains spitting out water, a sauna and a steam room. i got a one hour swedish massage and it was delightful...when you pay for a service you get use of the spa for a few hours and that was really great and relaxing. there's a little waiting room with couches and tons of magazines, and some refreshing fruity water stuff that was nice. 

the hotel is pretty much the end of the strip, so you have a bit of walking to do to get to the middle of stuff, but it's not impossible. the deuce buses stop right at mandalay though and it's a pretty good deal. it's connected to the luxor (which is so cool looking) and the excalibur by tram which will save you a few steps if you want. 

my ONLY complaint-i got a manicure and it was definitely the most i've ever spent on one, and it had one chip in less than a day, and a second chip in less than two days. by day three it pretty much looked like crap and i regretted spending so much on a manicure that didn't last. the nail salon part was the least inviting...not a lot of colors, only opi to choose from, and pretty steep for the finished product. i've gotten better $10 manicures!

We had the 'Great Room Suite' and the room was fantastic. Very large and a nice view. All the staff (Front desk, Bellman, Concierge and Maids) were very friendly, helpful and respectful. The swimming pools were a lot of fun also as was the casino except for the fact I left there with fewer $ than I started with.

We ate at several restaraunts on site including Wolfgang Puck's 'Lupo' restaraunt and the 'Border Grille' (both were very good and the staff was friendly) as well as Citizen's (which I was disappointed in both their service and overpriced food). We reserved a table Saturday night at the '1923 Bourbon & Burlesque' club and my wife said this was one of her favorite parts of the trip. The music and dancers were very entertaining and the bartenders were great. It was a fun crowd.

We visited several other hotels while we were there to catch some shows and most did not compare to Mandalay. The only downside is that Mandalay is at the end of the strip so you eiether have to take the tram (which is not bad), take a taxi, or walk a long way. We would definitely stay at Mandalay again as it was upscale and very clean but based upon our observations our second choice would be the Cosmopolitan or Caesars Palace as they were both very nice and more towards the center of the strip.",1,3,0

use whatever phrase you want - but Mandalay really needs to be revamped. When I was in college c. 2001, this was the hot spot...bellagio was for the stuffed shirts but the cool kids went to Mandalay to stay and party at Foundation Room and Rum Jungle

Mandalay obviously caters to a different crowd now. Here are my experiences:

- Jan 2010 - Mandalay Bay loses my reservation and tells another person that even though they had a reservation the hotel is sold out. After an hour of arguing they find us a reservation at the Mirage. Very uncool

- Jan 2011 - Thinking last year was a fluke, stay at MB again. This time after a night of drinking, about to crash we find a blood stain on our sheets. Again very very uncool...call housekeeping and ask them to come and change the sheets...say coming right up. 

45 minutes later, still no one. Call again and they say ""sorry really busy, will send someone right up""

additional 20 minutes later - Call again, this time I'm livid and start yelling at the front desk manager, he says he'll give me a $75 credit and send someone right up. someone comes up 15 minutes later and changes the sheets. 

After checking out - I am reviewing my bill and see:
- no $75 credit
- they double charged for a meal

I have to spend 45 minutes on the phone with Mandalay Bay after my trip to get my credit and the food charge reversed...

Also the crowd has changed significantly - my guess is that the affluent crowd has shifted to the Wynn properties as well as the Palms and HR. Seems Mandalay has become the discount family crowd.

I stayed 3 nights.

Night 1) Sheet came off the bed. Really??? Why are your sheets so small. We didn't even do anything but sleep and they just came off.

Morning 1) Hubby woke up with 2 bug bites..I just shrugged it off. Maybe he got bit ""outside"". Even though we didnt even leave the hotel. Whatever Mandalay.

Night 2) At 3 am the pipes in the bathroom errupt and sound like a whale is trying to escape the Pacific. What the heck. 

Morning 2) Hubby woke up with 3 DIFFERENT bites. This is weird. But he's still excited about his conference so he doesn't mind. I put some cream on it and give it a finger-to-bruise-kiss.

Night 3) Water comes on from the shower and guess what color it is... just guess.. PURPLE. yes. Sounds like a movie right?? wrong. its this stupid place. So after like 5 seconds its goes away and yes you guessed it, the creepy whale returned early in the morning. 

Morning 3 (check out day)- i wake up with 2 bites - one on my leg, and one on my back. Oh heck no. So glad this is over.

the bites itch bad & now I am feeling really bad for my husband because i didnt take him seriously. I call the front desk and here is a break down of what happened. 

Me: We have a problem.
Lady 1: Whats going on?
Me: Bites, Whales, Blah
Lady 1: I'm sorry that happened. We will check the rooms for pests. Let me take your number so my manager can call you back.
Me: Okay fine.


3 days later nobody calls...

I call back on day 4 to see a status update after no one called me. Lady 2 claimed they left a message on day 3......no they didnt & sshe claimed the room didnt have bugs.. yes they did.

-What we loved:
-Our spacious strip view room. 
-The TVs! My husband had never stayed at a hotel with a TV in the bathroom and he was very impressed. When we got home from our honeymoon we used some of our wedding money to upgrade our TV to LCD, because we were spoiled!
-The pool area was great. Unfortunately it was pretty chilly and windy most of the time we were there, so we didn't get to use it much. 
-The whole hotel just smells nice. A mixture of suntan oil and vanilla. 
-The casinos were well lit and not terribly crowded. 

What we weren't crazy about:
-It was far down the strip and kind of a pain to get around. We'd take the tram or walk to Excalibur, then cross over to MGM and catch the monorail. 
-Some of the dining at the hotel was pretty meh. Their buffet and Red White and Blue restaurants should be avoided. They're overpriced and the quality is only okay. 

Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at Mandalay. I'd say we'd stay there again, but I'd be lying. When we go back we'll probably stay somewhere else, as it's fun to check out all the hotels.",1,0,1

Although it said no one under 21 was allowed, there were still a few kids. The hotel also has some nice restaurants, though they are not my favorites in Vegas and I would probably head elsewhere to eat in the future. 

The hotel is well-located in case you want to escape the Strip quickly (located on the south end). It also connects to The Hotel at Mandalay Bay, which was great as I had my spa treatment there.

I lost count on how many times we have stayed there.  It has been about a year since our last stay.  On this stay I have to unfortunately say that the hotel has gone down hill.  I thought the stay was starting out pretty good.  Pre registered and was told we would receive an email when our room was ready for check-in.  We landed around 10:30am and we had a text saying room ready.  Great.  Arrived at hotel and found the mobile check in area machines that said out of service.  Had to stand in a mobile check in line with only one person working that line.  Needless to say, as we watched, the regular check in line moved faster because multiple people working that line.  Finally got up to person and given keys.  No comments made about our room from her.  OK, on our way.  Like I said, been here numerous times and had one of our nights comped.  By the way, even with a comped room you still get to pay that ridiculous money making resort fee of $35 per night plus tax.  Luckily we did not have a car because MGM now charges a $10 parking fee per night.  To continue.  Got to our room and looked out the window.  Great view of air conditioning unit.  That's all I want to see from my room in Las Vegas.  Obviously this was not a prime room and that is why it was available at 10:30am.  Back into line and wait.  Told them the room was unacceptable.  Told we had to wait until 3pm for another room since that was normal check-in.  We did get a room at 1:30.  We always have breakfast in the hotel.  The old restaurant was Raffles.  A little pricy but always good.  Raffles was replaced with a new restaurant called Seabreeze Cafe.  The hostess said just a name change.  Had to wait about 10 minutes for a table which is not too bad.  However, there were plenty of open tables when we were seated.  It looked like they were short of help.  Finally served and have to say the food was so sub par.  No taste to it.  We both ate less than half our breakfast.  Asked to speak to manager which we did.  We told him how we felt and he said he would talk to the chef.  He did nothing for us about the bill.  As a matter of fact he really did not seem very interested in our comments.  Other cutbacks in the hotel that we noticed.  They seemed short staffed at front desk and in the restaurant as I said.  Elevator out of service all day.  Escalator out of service part of the day.  Staircase carpet to beach pool was dirty.  Understand this is a highly traveled area.  Casino not very clean.  Noticed lots of dirty ashtrays near the slot machines.  In the room no shower cap.  We asked housekeeping for one and she said we would have to go to front desk.  Did not do that.  Shower door did not stay clsed all the way.  I would think housekeeping would tell the maintenance folks.The thinest toilet paper in the world.  Been to other countries with thicker toilet paper than this place.  The only redeeming value for staying at this hotel now is the pool area.  It is by far the best pool in Las Vegas.  Otherwise, we will not be staying at this MGM property anymore.",0,0,0

The artificial beach and the opulent decor and surroundings truly looked enticing. However, there were three aspects that prevented me from being able to enjoy my visit. Contrary to the promotional video on the Mandalay Bay website which features night concerts and people roasting marshmallows on the beach at night, Mandalay Bay Beach closes at 8 PM. For a city known for its night life, this seems ridiculously early. We booked Mandalay Bay for this feature but only spent 45 minutes at the pool during our entire four night stay. It was simply closed whenever we wanted to go. 
    The second aspect was that the room had the most uncomfortable giant pillows that I was told had been recently purchased for them. They were so uncomfortable that I felt as though I were sleeping on a staircase. Combine this with the fact that the curtains don't blackout the sun that begins hitting you in the face at 5:30 in the morning, and it's easy to see why this is not a comfortable resort in which to sleep. Not to mention the fact that the maid attempted to do maid service at 8:30 in the morning.  It's as if this place expects everyone to go to bed at 9:30 and hit the ground running at 7:30 every morning. In Las Vegas, this is just simply not most people's schedule. 
    The one thing that I will say that did make our stay enjoyable was the bartender at the main casino bar. His name was Gerad and he was very friendly and hospitable. We actually spent much more time and money in the Mandalay casino and bar because he was such a pleasant host. 
So, with that said, if they would replace their pillows, install heavier blackout curtains, and keep the pool open past the time that most retirement homes close theirs, this place would be an excellent choice. However, it is difficult for me to recommend a place where sleeping in was uncomfortable.",0,0,0

I really don't have many complaints regarding the hotel at all. The casino was kept very clean and had a nice open feel that kept you from feeling like you were a sardine. The only thing sucked about the casino was the smell of smoke, but that's not something you can avoid. The pools that I did see were awesome, but I didn't get a chance to go to the ""toptional"" pool ($30 admission to ""toptional"" pool). 

The rooms were amazing. Huge windows overlooked different parts of Vegas and the rooms were kept very clean and fresh. The bathrooms were very spacious and sported a huge soaker tub and a large glass shower. The biggest selling point for the bathrooms were the (slightly-outdated) TV's they had mounted that you could see from the tub. One small drawback to the room is that all the doors make a ton of noise, so there is no way to quietly move around the room without waking up the other people in your room. Also, the toilets make as much noise as those found on an airplane, so make sure you use the toilet prior to anyone going to sleep.

The part that almost made them give me give them a 3 star review is the way they handled the business conference I was part of. Our first meetings were at 7:45am (not that early) and all 200 of us had to eat and be seated between 7:30 and 7:45. Well the hotel only has one restaurant and a Starbucks that are open before 7:00am and the hotel apparently didn't warn the restaurant that we were coming because they were only staffed with 2 waitresses. My company completely overwhelmed the starbucks because the restaurant wasn't moving fast enough. 

Conferences aren't anything special and they really need to figure out how to handle that kind of capacity. Besides the business conference side of things, the hotel is overall wonderful and a great place in Vegas.

Tip: Go to their House of Blues restaurant. It's delicious!!! See my review :)",2,0,0

Mandalay Bay Beach is great, however it gets super crowded, so go early.

Downsides would be the ridiculous price points in the complex's restaurants - I know it's Vegas, but come ON - and the complete scam at the bellhop desk of checking your luggage through to your flight for you. We had the privilege of paying extra $$ for that honor, only to have our luggage miss the flight despite a five hour lead time. Skip that part for SURE.

As a side note, the constant marketing of the MGM monopoly (seems like half the strip is now owned by MGM, including Mandalay Bay) is pretty dreary. Even some of the casino games are branded with the M Life crap.",1,0,0

All the complaints about the wait time to check in, the parking fess, resort fees etc. However, to me, resort and parking fees were not a big deal since most places have such fees. 

I requested early check-in which was an additional $35 and I must say so worth it!!! We arrived Saturday morning, check in took less than 5 minutes. No line, no hassle from the receptionist. When we went down to the lobby later on during the day, the line to check in was ridiculous. So I was beyond glad I had requested early check in.  They gave me a beautiful room on the 28th floor. The room was really nice and spacious. The beds were comfy, pillows, beautiful vanity mirrors. Our bags were delivered to our room in a decent amount of time. So far so good!

We checked out Daylight which was fun!!! The bar was super packed. I must give the bartenders a pat on their backs for taking care of everyone. Both girls that helped us were super chill and nice. I would of died if I worked there. So kudos to them! Not an easy job to do. 

The only thing I must say was a bit absurd was that our last night there we got a noise complaint. Three security guards knocked on the door stating there had been a complaint about us being too loud. Mind you all we were doing that night was watching TV and talking amongst ourselves. We didn't have any music playing. So we asked the guard what do you recommend we do as we are just hanging out. They said ""maybe talk a bit lower."" LOL Not to mention it was only 930ish at night. It felt as though the people next door were too sensitive. It's Vegas. What do you expect for people to sleep before 10. Hmm. 

Moving on to the pools. The wave pool and lazy river= AWESOME. I did get stuck under the waterfall at the lazy river which was pretty hilarious. I couldn't get my tube to move away from the waterfall.  My friends just laughed at me. Kinda bummed we didn't get a chance to check out all the other pools since we did other things. 

We went to Border Grill for dinner. The food is delicious. I had their chicken enchiladas in salsa verde which was so yummy. I am Mexican so my expectations are always high when it comes to Mexican food. I will definitely be eating there next time I am in Vegas. The black cherry mojito so good. The restaurant was simply amazing. And our server was also amazing. I don't remember her name. It was Monday night around 8-9, blonde  pretty girl. 

All in all, I am glad we stayed here. The resort is beautiful, the rooms are spacious, the food and pools are amazing. I will definitely be staying here again. =)",0,0,1

Stayed at Mandalay Bay for a work conference\/trade show, my coworkers and I booked through the conference early so our rates were pretty reasonable.  
It's on the south end of the strip closest to the airport so it was like a 10 minute cab ride.  

As most of the big resort hotels on the strip, Mandalay is massive when pulling up to the front. I do enjoy how orderly things are when it comes to drop off area, taxi line, baggage area, check-in etc. Line seemed super long as i approached the check-in,  but it actually took about 10 minutes before I got to the front desk associate.  

Check-in was pretty quick, asked for my particulars,  asked if I wanted a higher or lower floor, explained some amenities they offer and then directed me to the elevators. 

Room is larger than I thought, I got 2 beds, pretty good view, bathroom with shower and a separate tub, not sure how they knew I loved bubble baths. Was quite happy with the room I got and would stay here again.

Casino is just passed the elevators walking to the convention area and the nice restaurants. Casino staff was nice & friendly when playing, wasnt too busy as I played roulette so it was fun just chatting with others and having a little fun.  

Restaurant selections were great, from quick grab & go to sit down places and from super casual to fancy schmancy. We tried a few places and really enjoyed the food. Also, there is a food court near the convention center area.

Glad I stayed here, since my stay here was for work I didn't get much free time to enjoy the resort part, go to the pool or get married at the chapel.  

Will most likely be back next year for work again, will recommend others to stay here as well whether its for leisure or business.",7,3,7

In the past twelve months  I have stayed at Caesars and the Wynn, and would choose either of these two for the next time I visit.

Why? Let me list the many reasons...

As others mentioned, it's way too far away from everything else on the strip. 

Ridiculously long check in. The average time per guest on a Friday afternoon was 10 minutes. 

EVERY morning at 9 a.m. the maid was chomping to get in the room. That's a bit early in Vegas, people.

1 towel per guest at the pool? Towels were grayish or brownish and thin. The Wynn had thick and fluffly and sparkly white ones...

Lounges at the pool were neighborhood pool quality with plastic slats. I chose not to pay $25 per chair + $50 for an umbrella. The Wynn has comfy padded chairs.

I'm not visiting a water park, I'm a guest at a hotel. Therefore I find it ridiculous that you have to buy tubes for the lazy river. Really poorly made tubes.  Both of ours mysteriously popped in the water the second day.

In four days, I  was never approached at any point while gambling and offered a players card. Compared to the other two hotels, which sent a rep to me in the first hour I was in the casino...

Also waited 30+ minutes for a server to offer or bring drinks while gambling. Again, compared to the other two which had supremely quick service.

Furniture in the room was chipped, battered, worn. 

When we checked in, there was not a single beer in the mini fridge. It took three phone calls and three days before they stocked beer for us. 

They've downgraded the products they offer (shampoo\/soap) since the last time we visited. They used to offer name brand stuff, now it is cheap! 

Elevator hallway area on our floor always HOT - like the air didn't work.
Our AC in the room never budged either, no matter what we did to the settings.

I had extremely fond memories from the last time but they were all wiped away after this visit.",1,0,0

I wish I had gotten one of the newly renovated rooms. The restaurants and drinks at pool are so overpriced. $23 + $2 tip for a Bloody Mary in a souvenir cup (I was not asked if I wanted another option). At least it's BPA free... but still a rip off... considering I only used it once during my 1 night stay. The chairs at the pool were so grimy and dirty, looks like they haven't been wiped down in years... make sure to grab a few extra towels. Next time I'll check out one of the newer hotels.",0,0,0

Couldn't have one available until 7:00pm!!  So, apparently, if one doesn't feel like checking out until 5pm it's completely acceptable to screw to screw up another ones family vacation time! We made our reservations in January for our June trip. There is no excuse for a room not to be available by atleast the 3pm check-in time. We had reservation for dinner and tickets for a show that we missed because after 7 hours of flying the 5 of us wanted showers before going anywhere.  We were told ""O-well"" by the registration ""manager"" Tony. He could not have been anymore rude and unhelpful towards us. I was appalled at his lack of caring. Nothing they could do! I asked to speak to his manager.  We thought they would Atleast give us a temporary room to get cleaned up so we wouldn't miss our reservation.  However, then we would have to forfeit our booked suite that we $3,000 for the 4 day weekend and instead someone sleep on a cot!!!! For over $800 a night this kind of service is unacceptable. When we did eventually get our room that evening the bathrooms weren't even cleaned and bedroom wasn't swept. Their was hair all over the shower floor and walls. And crumbs in the floors. Had they agreed to give me a full refund I would have went elsewhere. NEVER will I come back or reccomend this hotel. They wouldn't even comp us tickets to a show or shark reef.

Television, of which I was stoked to see in the bathroom, did not function. The room on the fifth floor of the resort had a horrible view of the tar grey casino roof. 

I mentioned above as I checked out for future hoteliers, and they thanked me though offered no discount.

I personally think that Mandalay Bay is kid friendly because it has a shark aquarium and a pool suitable for children along with one that accommodates the younger and older adults. Every time my family and I would come here for a vacation we always stayed here until this day. 
The rooms are very nice, updated, spacious and clean which is a plus. One thing that disappointed my family and I recently was that the hot water wasn't working in both of our rooms and it was difficult for us to use the bathroom without being inconvenienced. Staff and employees treated us well and helped us with our every need despite our room issues. Mandalay Bay gave us free passes to use their spa all day due to the bathrooms in our rooms not working and also gave us a 4 night free stay as well.

The suite itself was really spacious. It has two restrooms, a separate standing shower and jacuzzi bathtub. There's two mini fridges in the kitchen\/minibar area with a TV there and another TV in the living room, bedroom, and bathroom.

Things we dislike:
-Parking is far from the room entrance
-the room has REALLY REALLY POOR sound insulation.  Around 2 AM, we heard the next door kid talking to his mom.  Then the mom was yelling to the kid.  Kid was crying........ We could hear ""every single word"" in the room next to ours.  I was glad it was just kid vs mom, you know....

Sunday rolls around and after lunch, we go back to our room and of course, the key doesn't work.  So we have to go all the way back down to the front desk and wait in their long ass line to get it fixed.  Brandy, our ""front desk helper"" was so incredibly rude I couldn't look at her when I left.  After telling her  I MADE sure we had a 4 pm checkout she still probed me as if I was CHEATING her, as if I didn't really have a late check out and i was trying to weasle my way into more time at their crappy ass hotel.  She even asked "" did you take your luggage out?"" and AFTER I said no she proceeded to tell me ""sometimes the cleaning ladies see its clear and then assumed you checked out"" so I said, ""That's impossible"" Any idiot can take one step into that room and see there were two big luggages and my stuff was everywhere.  Even so, does that mean..oh okay lets deactivate your card even though you paid for the late checkout?  Brandy did not even apologize for the inconvenience or the mixup.  She took her sweet time interrogating me and making me wait.  And then to top it off, when i went back upstairs the cleaning lady pulled me aside to ask me when I was checking out and I said 4pm and she said "" AY YI YI, did u tell front desk!?!""  umm.....yes because I paid for it! At this time I just wanted to leave because they were all breathing down my neck.

I wish I could say that was an isolated even of rudeness.  But no, the bad service was even on the phone.  I was given a letter saying ""please check ur balance on the TV so you can take care of it before you leave"" So as a obedient patron, I did as such.  Of course the TV doesnt have that option and it say ""call front desk"" So i call front desk and explain the situation and she goes ""you do it on the TV"" and I say the TV doesnt work and she says "" Well thats the only way"" okay.....well thats why I am calling you .....(just doing what Im told!) she tells me she will reset it, but nope nop this never gets done.  

Mandalay Bay is getting old.  It once was a nice place to stay but no longer.  The spa is really showing its age as well.  Their jets werent working, the robes had big ol holes in them, they even ran out of clean towels,,,cmon people you are a SPA you need plenty of clean towels.  
The pool is looking run down too. It was way too crowded to feel liek a relaxing getaway, and this was when it was cloudy and 60-70 degrees.

Suffice to say I didn't want to wait even longer for food that should not take that long to correct.  They do not know how to treat their guests.  There are plenty of hotels here to choose from so relying on poor service will not win them more customers.  I should have stayed at the Four Seasons like I originally planned - lesson learned.

I was promised a room with a King size bed and they ended up putting us in a room with 2 Queens. A little unnecessary and awkward. Also, we were told that with the room change, we'd be on a higher floor with a better view. Not so. The view was of a parking lot and rooftops (not pretty ones).

The restaurants were just ok.  I was bummed there wasn't really anywhere to grab something to go unless you were out by the pool.  The Asian noodle place was just terrible.  The 24 hour cafe was good.  Rum Jungle was overrated.  

The casinos were fun.  They were less crowded than in other places on the strip, so we were able to learn to play craps on a slow-ish Sunday night.  

If you want to stay in the center of the strip, dont stay here.  It's a looooong walk down Las Vegas Boulevard.

First thing we were greeted with was the 10 minute wait to get into the valet. Then the great news the they would be charging $18 per day. Acceptable? Maybe, if they actually now had better service. It is almost like they are on purpose trying to get people not to valet. We checked in on a Sunday with no events and waited over 10 minutes. On Sunday at 11PM us and 3 other cars were made to sit and wait about 15 minutes for no apparent reason to park get out of our car. There appears to be 1 valet now? How do you go from providing fast free parking to now charging $18 and have the worst valet on the strip? We waited 22 minutes to retrieve our car on a Monday at 10AM. I couldn't even imagine going here on a Friday or Saturday.

I read a previous post about MB saying they increased their security and that being the reason for these additional fees. I saw not one security person.

Then once finally inside BAM! The 1 1\/2 hour wait to check in on a Sunday. When we came back at 11PM there was an even larger line with people laying all over the lobby. I have no idea what they are doing. Last trip we raved about how fast check in was an that was on Saturday at noon. I would never come here on a weekend without expecting to wait a few hours to just check in.

The rooms are decent although our shower was backed up and created a dirty smelly mess that was in all honestly fixed an cleaned by two very polite staff members.

I have been to many resorts that charge parking. I get it, but don't degrade your service once you start charging. It makes the fee total unacceptable.

If you have a family it is one of the few casinos on the strip with a family friendly pool. Is it the cleanest pool? No, but I guess with that volume of people it is what it is.

At the back of the large room was a queen bed, chair and a wall of windows.
A door led to a separate bedroom with yet another queen size bed, small table with two chairs and a single bathroom. 
The large bathroom was my dream. I could stay in there and never leave.
Double sinks, huge jacuzzi tub, open shower are made of rock and a separate toilet area. My friend said that the restrooms are like that in all the rooms? And people complain? 
I have traveled around the world and stayed in some very very nice hotels. I am always ready to pay for a nice place to sleep. The room we had was one of the nicest rooms I have seen! The cost was very low for what we got and the service was outstanding! We had one little hiccup, which was really no big deal (batteries died in our remote control)...we called down to the front just to have someone bring batteries and we were comped for breakfast the next morning for the inconvenience. 
That is going above and beyond! I had the eggs benedict, which were not notch! Room service is usually just ok, but I think the breakfast was above par. The hot chocolate was thick and creamy, the eggs were perfectly poached and the hollandaise sauce was not separated like in coffee shops!

If I ever get dragged to LV again, I will only stay here.",2,0,0

We reserved a room here for non-smoking.  Upon arrival- they were out of non-smoking rooms and we got this DISGUSTING smoking room.  We even had them spray the room and it still made me sick.  Despite telling the front desk about my allergies, they refused to move me to another room or upgrade me OR COMP ME.  WTF!? So I'm supposed to suffer all night?  My horrible night doesn't even end there.  The iron was crappy and the room is so poorly designed that it's impossible to plug in your iron and iron your clothes without pulling the iron out of the socket.  I made the mistake of requesting extra towels at 1130pm.  I waited and waited and waited...nobody came.  So I went to bed.  At 2am in the freaking morning somebody knocks on the door.  Are you serious?!  I refused to get out of bed since I was so darn tired.  2 minutes later they knock again.  Excuse me, it's 2am in the morning and I need sleep, will you go away?!  Anyways, you'd think they'd leave me alone after not answering after the 3rd time.  Instead they CALL my room to get me to answer the door.  No apologies for waking me up.  Seriously- the towels could have been left outside the room or if i wanted them, I would have called again the next morning UGH!!!

Continuing on, the next day they finally were able to move me to another room.  It still didn't make my stay any better- the rooms are just dated and old and honestly I should have just stayed at Luxor since you have to walk like 2 miles to get to the convention center.  So many other things here really made my stay in Vegas the worst stay ever and I come here at least a few times a year.  I would gladly pay so much more to stay at a different hotel since the service was horrible and the amenities are just sad.

I will admit the pool is nice and the drinks are pretty good but I did have a waitress that ripped me off bigtime.

We chose to stay in the ""Bay Suite"" which had one king bed, a smaller couch and a pretty large bathroom with a tub, shower and tv to watch in the tub (along side the much larger tv in the living room). We didn't spend a lot of time in the room but what we got from it- it was perfect for a couples getaway and the bed was VERY comfortable. 

We attended a boxing match at the Mandalay Bay events center which was pretty big! The rest of the hotel has many restaurants but unfortunately we did not try any (we ate at other hotels). We did, however, visit the ""beach"" at Mandalay which was nice. Since we stayed until Tuesday there weren't a lot of people and we were able to easily find pool chairs and some space to hang out. After doing so, we hit the casino at Mandalay. Many options for tables but pretty high buy-ins. You can definitely find much less expensive at surrounding hotels. Plus the casino staff was not very pleasant (give or a take a few two).

After a 5 1\/2 hour flight from Boston, when I entered the lobby, there were approximately 400 people (yes, you read that right) in line waiting to check-in\/check-out. Now, casinos are pretty sophisticated these days, so why did the folks at MB not figure out that this many people would be arriving\/departing? The staff seemed a bit overwhelmed. After a conversation with the person in front of me, I did mobile check-in, but still had to wait 1\/2 hour for confirmation. An hour of waiting was not a good start. The room was very nice, especially the bathroom, very clean and during my stay, the floor was very quiet. The next day, I wanted breakfast and visited the restaurant. After seeing the $17 price tag for two slices of bacon, two eggs and a piece of toast, I passed. Are you serious? I visited the McDonalds across the street and got an egg mcmuffin and OJ for $3.68, delish and probably a lot better than the $17 breakfast. Everything in the hotel was pricey, including tickets to Michael Jackson One. The $250 price tag is outrageous. For that kind of money, Michael Jackson would have to rise from his grave. The hotel also charges $12 a day for parking. When I asked if a guest could use my parking pass, I was told ""no."" After vehemently complaining about being nickled and dimed, 3 days of resort fees were refunded, which I thought was great. And don't get me started on resort fees. I was told that the fees were for wifi and pool and gym use. Well, I did not use the pool or gym while I was there and my Verizon wifi fees are $50 a month. This is a RIPOFF.

I don't usually stay on the Strip because it's too crowded and expensive. I will never stay at Mandalay Bay or any other hotel on the Strip again. I will return to the Golden Nugget downtown where I feel more welcome. They charge a resort fee too but at least they throw in a couple of bottles of water, parking is FREE, gambling is much better and there's easy access to the freeway.",0,1,1

Whenever family or friends are in town and want to come down to the strip to hang out and do some quick gambling we head over to Mandalay Bay. I love how they have spruced up the center bar. 

My husband and I have come to Mandalay Bay two years in a row for New Years Eve and enjoyed the atmosphere and the size of the crowd was not too crazy, so during NYE, this is a good place to be!

I had the pleasure of staying at the hotel for my bachelorette party in April of 2010. The room was pretty nice and the bathroom was huge! I think we had a suite, not just a standard room...hard to remember with all that alcohol in our systems. At 3:30 am when we stumbled in from a night of dancing in painful high-heels, the spa tub was perfect for soaking our feet and having a champagne night cap!

None were broken, the hotel is just cheap.  10-15 or more minutes to get an elevators most of the time.  Or the pool - which isn't actually a pool one could relax in - it was over 104 degrees every single day yet NO SHADE.  you could ""rent"" an umbrella - for $300 PER DAY.  I am not making this up.  The Cabanas were for rent also, $675-$995 PER DAY, depending on if it was the weekend.  But $300 per day for the shade umbrella???  Please!!!!!

Absolutely no chairs or benches anywhere on the property, inside or out; no place whatsoever to just sit and relax and read or anything.  Enormous empty sprawling space insdie and out - with nothing.  Apparently they want to force you to stay in Casino or one of the several horrifically expensive restaurants.  

No prices on ANYTHING.  This includes the couple of ""gift shops"" selling toiletries, soda, water, candy, cards, magazines, all the usual stuff.  Not a price on a single thing, not even a pack of gum.  You had to ASK price of every single thing.  Of course, when a $2.99 bottle of water costs $5.50, it's  small wonder.

Which brings us to the Mini Bar.  It was MAGNETIZED, so that if you even moved something aside, you'd be charged.  So could not use the refrigerator at all.  

Location is AWFUL as well. It's not only at the end of the ""strip"" - the next place is more than a mile away.  You are stuck in the middle of nowhere with absolutely nothing to do, no place to sit, unless you pay the $300 daily fee for the pool since  shade is pretty important when it's 105+ degrees.

Signage is unbelivably bad.  Almost impossible to find your way around.

Granted it was supremely busy because of the holiday, paired with the ""Lion King"" and nearing the end of the Michael Jackson, ""Immortal"" tour, it wasn't too bad.

One thing I love about the MB is that their rooms are always consistent.  I can always expect a nice, bigger than typical hotel room, sporting modern decor withi it's dark woods and beige contrasts, along with a small couch to lounge on, floor to ceiling windows, comfy bed with crisp sheets, and two closets, one of which had a wall safe.  The bathroom was huge and featured dual vanities, large soaking tub, standing shower and a toilet in it's own room.

About the bathroom, if you're sharing the room with family or friends and are quite shy, be forewarned that there is a window into the bathroom that's partially frosted.  Standing at the right angle, you can see right through it.  Regardless of hotel, I honestly wouldn't share a room with my family while in Vegas just because.  But with friends, we've honestly seen worse things.

On the flipside, there are some negatives, such as the walls are pretty thin that you can hear what's going on in the room next to you and I literally mean, what's going on!  Also, be sure to request a room without a connecting door, otherwise they'll check in some ""Woo Girls"" (You need to watch HIMYM to get it.) which their noisy, wooing will make you think they're wooing right inside your room.  When a neighboring door slams, oh it slams hard and shut that you'll feel it and hear it, even at 4am.  Lastly, they charge this $20 resort fee, which includes wireless internet (Which SUCKS so bad, the longest I'm stay connected is maybe 10-minutes.), access to the Cardio room only (There's an extra fee for spa access), local calls (Really?  Ever heard of a cell phone?) and daily newspaper (Which you have to pick up at the gift shop, but wait, the USA Today is always complimentary at every hotel?).

The rooms have kept up well but they're going to need some renovation in the next couple years as their carpet is showing it's age, furniture is getting dinged and frankly, the newer properties such as the Aria and even the Wynn are raising the bar quite high.

Unfortunately, I don't care for any of the restos featured inside the MB, although I did eat at the Burger Bar located in their shopping mall, Mandalay Place.  A plus is that there's not one, but two Starbucks on the main level, but of course their prices are inflated than your typical Sbux location.  If you're anti-Sbux, just walk down the hall towards THEhotel and there's a coffee spot in their lobby.

Gaming is pretty decent and they offer all the usual slots and table games with decent limits.

We watched the MJ ""Immortal"" show here and the Events Center was bigger than your typical Cirque du Soleil stage.  If you're watching a similar show, I'd suggest picking seats that face forward, rather than from the sides.

Location, well, you're literally on the south end near the airport so you're pretty far from the heart of the Strip.  If you're a walker, then no biggie as there's a hallway that connects to the Luxor and a tram that connects to Excalibur and so forth.  You can always do the ""Deuce"" bus which is $2 a ride and the stop is located acrosst he street.  Otherwise, you need to cab it or get a car.  Also, since you're near the airport you can hear mild flight noise if your window faces the airport.  Although you can see the runway, you can barely hear it unless you're standing by the window.

Overall, I'd stay at the MB again, but it's not necessarily my first pick anymore.",1,1,1

Mandalay is at the end of the strip though, away from all of the hustle and bustle that MGM would offer. However, it might be a good change of pace and getaway if you go to Vegas frequently. Everything was so good about this place! The only bad thing I can think of is how the room service lady was still cleaning when we had already checked in and arrived to our door.. the bathroom has a see through glass in the middle of the wall the separates bathroom from room, and huge gaps in between their bathroom french doors, so that basically equals zero degree privacy. and umm.. no Q-tips!

But my last visit has me questioning should I ever stay at his hotel again. First of all, when I'm in Vegas I love to sleep in past noon. Especially if I was out all night and didn't hit the bed til 3 or 4am. 

Every morning I have the maid knocking or coming into my bedroom around 9AM while I'm sleeping, even with the privacy card hanging outside my door! They apologize and told me that they got a note that my room was not vacant or it was the day to be checked out. 

Okay, even if it's my checkout date it's still early! Check out time isn't until 11AM.

I hear people outside the hallway screaming and talking really loud around 5 or 6AM. Mandalay Bay needs some security to be to be roaming the hallway to take care of these drunkies. 

The carpet had stains, smells funny and my bed smell like cigarette which didn't make any sense unless they didn't change my bedsheet! 

Plus I was told that all the rooms are NON smoking rooms. So why does my bedsheet smell like cigarette? The rooms were pretty outdated which was fine to me as long as they were clean. But it wasn't, and the drawer under the TV was creepy! Every time I close it and I turn around its cracked open a little bit. 

I'm starting to think my room was haunted. I always choose to stay at Mandalay Bay because I love the pool, the beach and the shark reef! But that's not enough to make me overlook how dirty and smelly my rooms was.  

I always thought of Mandalay Bay as one of the nicer hotel\/resort. I would recommend my family and friends to this hotel even if it's a little bit far from the strip. I also asked to be upgraded to the the remodeled room but was rejected. After seeing their huge poster that was promoting their new updated rooms. 

But the person next to me got to get a remodeled room but I didn't? I booked a room with you guys months ago! At least 3 months ahead...

Why have a poster asking your customers to ask for a updated\/upgraded\/remodel room just to turn us down?? I booked the hotel months ahead and got an email about the updated\/remodeling their doing. But some other guest next to me was offered a new remodel room but I wasn't and was rejected. That's fine, I'll take my money elsewhere. 

As I'm writing this review at the airport I can't help but wonder what happened to Mandalay Bay? After the last visit I don't even think I wanna go back even if they finish their all their updated\/remodeled rooms. 

The resort itself is beautiful to bad the room is gross and dirty. Plus the person in the front desk seems uninterested in checking me in.

Thanks Mandalay Bay, I will definitely be canceling my reservation I have with you in a few months! Nope, I won't be staying here again!


I always help my family with booking hotels in Vegas, I'm definitely sending them elsewhere. With the $$$ you charge us at least give me a clean smelling bed to sleep in. Worst thing in the world is a non smoker sleeping on a bed that smelled like a cigarette tray!",22,14,9

*** Original Post ***:  So, Booked a 1500 Sq Ft, 2 room suite expecting it to be bomb.com and it was more like meh.com. These suites need a freshening badly. The furniture was pretty shabby. The stains on the little day bed lounger in my bedroom gave me the creeps. Most of the tables were noticably chipped and worn, light bulbs burned out in several lamps and stains on everything fabric and carpeted. Oh and for that other Yelper comment regarding ""Greeted by that signature ""Mandaly Bay scent"" Ya, that'd be OG Kush! Freakin' halls reaked of it! WTF! At 5 bills a night on an off winter weekend you'd expect a lot more! I stayed at The Encore over NYE and the accomodations were full on swanky compared to this dump. Only reason for me to ever stay here again is because the HOB\/Foundation room are here and I'm a member of the F-Room and like to party there and don't need to drive around. I know, I know lot's of reviews say otherwise and well, I'm a non-drinker so my vision isn't skewed or blurred and I've stayed at a bunch of properties (minus the real new ones) here in Vegas and there are much better values out there. Encore is one of them. Just my humble opinion.",1,1,1

Maybe mandalay bay is really so old that they sent out a tellagraph by pony express to fix there gaspowered computer system?

Cons: The thermostat was right underneath the only vent in the room, so it was pretty cold and took all night to warm up. The bed was sub-par and not all that comfortable. The walls were pretty thin, evidenced by the fact that I can hear conversations going on in the next room over. And I could hear the gurgling noises of the pipes in the rooms above and next to us. It was pretty crowded, it took almost 30 minutes on the day that I left to get my car back from the valet service.

I ventured from the parking garage and was a little sad to see the Rum Jungle is no longer apart of their vast array of restaurants. The water and fur walls were a favorite of mine. I pointed out to my husband the Red Square (were I once was promised a free meal for 2 there from the owner or manager for solving a riddle while employed at red, white and blue. Come to think of it I never even picked up my first and only paycheck either.) I pointed out that Red Square had an ice bar to keep your vodka the perfect ice cold temperature without watering it down with ice. I showed him the shelves for which you could pay to store your beloved vodka in ice cold temps for you to enjoy when you come for your next visit.

We walked by Red, White and Blue formerly Bleu Blanc Rouge where I left employment for a management opportunity at another Mandalay Bay restaurant, the Border Grill. (see that review for more insight)

Aureole for the reknown Wine Fairies that are harnessed in to retrieve wine from a tower to high for my comfort.

China Grill with interesting outhouses for restrooms.

Starbucks, the main event and then were off to my favorite the Border Grill for lunch outside while overlooking the lazy river and pool area.

First the good things:  Loved the entertainment.  Wow - of course - it was amazing.  The choice of restaurants also did not disappoint. Everyone who worked there was beyond thoughtful and kind.  Every single person who worked there went out of their way to say hello with a smile.  I felt welcomed and at ease.  My hotel room was roomy with a gorgeous marbled bathroom, soaking tub, beautiful shower.  Mandalay is within view of the airport.  A shuttle is needed but is very quick.
Now the not so good stuff:  You have to pay to do anything.  At all.  No coffee, no coffee pot,  no bottled water (unless you pay $5.00), no refrigerator that you can use, nothing.  A refrigerator is in your room: stocked with the typical alcohol and sodas that they want you to purchase.  If you use the refrigerator at all you will be charged a $50.00 re-stocking fee.  You can order a refrigerator for $35.00.  So I used an ice bucket to keep anything cool.  I was traveling across three time zones and was looking for tea or coffee at their 0300, my 0600.  My only option was to order room service.  Excuse me?  I am sorry, but if I go to a typical hotel and pay half the price I get free coffee, free breakfast, a newspaper etc.  Thankfully I was there for a conference so didn't have to pay for all of my meals.

I have never felt more like royalty than I did during our stay.

First let me say that the Hotel is beautiful and the rooms were very comfortable (I would know as I spent my time there in 3 different rooms due to wedding arrangements. The staff was friendly and attentive, and really made us feel at home. The wedding area ""Valley of the Falls"" was BEAUTIFUL and looks even more amazing in our pictures. Wow! What a hidden gem.

On the wedding side of things, our experience was magical. Elizabeth in Weddings, was like a family member to us. She remained in constant contact with us during the planning of our ceremony and showed genuine interest in our wedding being perfect. She made things happen that seemed unlikely and by the time our stay in Vegas was over and we were ready to go back home to LA, we tearfully shared hugs and best wishes for each other.

Shout out to our wedding photographer Gilbert also, who was fantastic.

Leaving Mandalay Bay which we had stayed at for 5 days and gotten married at was difficult for us. It felt like leaving a second home. We are excited to visit them many times in the future as they are now a part of our life and history.

But first, the few things that were great about my time there: 1. My interaction with the staff -- everyone was lovely and helpful. 2. The pools. I enjoyed the wave pool and lazy river, and the crowd at the pool was diverse and family friendly. 3. The Michael Jackson One show is spectacular. If there's any reason to come to the Mandalay, this is it.

As for what was just fine:

* The rooms are nice, but they are loud. Between the bathroom doors that are noisy to open and close, the air unit that makes a rhythmic din at random hours, and the thin walls that enable you to hear bathroom doors opening and closing and toilets flushing, I found it difficult to get a decent night sleep. Also, the air unit seems to work great during the day, but at night, the rooms are suspiciously warm.

* The bathroom amenities are basic at best. Shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and a hairdryer. That's it. No q-tips, no shoe-shine cloth, no shower cap, no mouthwash, no sewing kit. Plush robes are available upon request. Also, the towels are scratchy and there is no coffee in the rooms. There are multiple Starbucks though where you will be fleeced. Prices are at least double the normal. ""Casino prices"" I was told, whatever that means.

* The food is average. I dined at a variety of restaurants in the hotel and in the Shoppes, and, with the exception of the seafood spot at the front of the Shoppes, nothing was particularly great. Friends ate at one of the upscale restaurants and they said it wasn't worth the prices. Don't go here for the food. I even ordered room service and the meal was delivered not on a tray or cart but in a brown bag with plastic utensils.

* The Shoppes leave much to be desired. Definitely don't come here to go shopping unless you need to buy Lush products.

Ultimately, I wouldn't willingly stay at the Mandalay again. The Wynn and Venetian hotels are worth the price difference. I would, though, stay at The Four Seasons. Friends and I wandered through there this morning and not only is it beautiful, but they have a wonderful looking buffet, too.",1,0,0

The tub was welcoming although I wish they included some bath bubbles for us to use! The casino itself was nice but the minimum table amount was $15 so we found ourselves heading to Luxor for the $10 tables. After a certain time security checked our room cards in order to access our rooms so that was cool.

The Good:
-$65\/night for 5 days (online summer special found on slickdeals.net)
-Great pool area.
-The casino design is great, one of my favorites.  The tables are spread out and you aren't choked to death with slot machines like most casinos.  Sports Book and Poker Room are within 20 second walking distance.
-Polite front desk.
-Polite housekeeping.
-Good vibe from everyone.
-The tram that brings you from the last major resort (Mandalay Bay) to Tropicana Ave\/Strip.
-Good selection of restruants and shops.
-Awesome bed.
-Awesome view.
-Great hook-up from staff, got upgraded to the jacuzzi spa suite for no additional cost.  (COUGH, COUGH, thanks to a certain Yelper!)

The Alright:
-Signs need to be checked.  Some of the signs showing locations would throw you for a loop.  Trying to locate Border Grille, Rumjungle and Red Square wasn't too easy without some help.
-Furniture.  The yellow square sofa in our room was covered with stains and there was painters tape still left on the window rails from previous work.  It didn't bother me much, but it would bother alot of other people.

The Bad:
-Dumb Mini-Bar staff.  I explained to the front desk how I wanted the mini fridge and goodies removed from the room.  This was taken care of immediately.  From Sunday to Wednesday it was empty.  Thursday morning after breakfast we return to find it half full.  Everything is on sensors and just moving the items will get you charged.  Luckily I didn't get too drunk to forget the pricey stuff. $$$$
-Crowded pool.  They squeezed so many chairs together and almost all were occupied.  We managed to grab two chairs @ noon infront of the wave pool.  The hot swedish lady next to me was like 3 inches away.  Good for me, but damn I would like some room to put my stuff under my chair.
-Distance.  It takes time to get to where you need to go. Do not rely on taxis.  We rented a car for three days and it came in handy.  
-Tram.  Closes pretty early.  Us drunks don't like wandering through Excalibur or Luxor just to get back to the room.  Whatever though, I'll still hit up your craps tables.
-Kids.  More children here than at Excalibur, NY-NY, Monte Carlo, Bellagio etc.  It has to be the awesome pool area attracting families.
-Elevators.  I hate Kathy Griffin, DO NOT PLAY HER STUPID COMMERCIALS!  I also love how it's eight elevators for the first 17 floors and then eight elevators for the next 17 floors.  How many operate at a time?  Maybe three or four if you're lucky.  Either sleep in or sneak our early, using an elevator around 10am-11am will suck.  Everyone is checking in or checking out and you will be stuck waiting 15 mins for an elevator you can actually get on.

All in all, it's worthy of four stars.  Some small fixes could get it to five.  I would stay here again on a special rate.  The new Mandalay Bay ""special"" is $99.99\/night.  Meh, I'll wait till it drops back down alot......",1,0,0

I called Guest Services and my hair dryer came to the room when my hair was already dry..from waiting. Thanks a lot.

Checking in was a pain too. There were only 3 people working the long line of people.

Location wise: Never again. Too far away from all the fun on the strip. There's a tram but the tram shuts down at 11pm. Taking a cab from the hotel is an option...but keep the cash and spend it elsewhere. 

WARNING: Do not touch anything from the fridge. they have a super smart fridge that charges you if you pull their overpriced drinks out to chill your own beverage and alcohol.

We could see the valet guys all running around, but none of them seemed to pay any attention to the line of cars getting longer.

Once we were checked in though, the hotel was awesome! The shark reef aquarium was my favorite part. My least favorite part of the weekend was the air conditioner set to 65, but not actually going below 80. Other than that, I will be back!",0,1,0

Rooms: okay, not huge, but not small. No robes in the rooms (like at Venetian and Palazzo),the mirrors for putting on your makeup are below average, the cleaning people didn't restock everything daily like they are supposed to, and if you want in room coffee you have to pay $4, yes, $4 for a crappy, gross cup of joe. Not up to my standards. Who wants to go downstairs for a cup of coffee across the casino at Starbucks in your pi's at 8am?! So all in all the rooms are just okay.

Gym\/Spa: They have a crappy, tiny, hot, crowded gym you can use for free OR you can pay $30 to use the legit, nice, spacious, uncrowded other gym. RIP OFF! Again, when we stay at Venetian\/Palazzo we get to use the super legit Canyon Ranch Gym\/Spa for FREE! Spa is so-so, it's small, the treatment rooms open up to the outer area of the walk ways in the spa to the gym area, not making if very private if you are walking around in your robe. 

Pool: it's okay, NO shade anywhere and if you want an umbrella to relax under, prevent sun damage and sun burns you have to pay $50! Yes, $50\/day\/umbrella for shade! CRAZY! You also have to pay $20\/raft if you want to float on a raft or go around the lazy river. RIP OFF! The pool itself is just so-so, nothing amazing.

Restaurants: Kumi the Sushi Place is AMAZING! Great food, drinks and service. RM Seafood is great, Charlie Palmer at the Four Seasons is a standard steakhouse and good. Foundation Room for drinks is cool b\/c of the view of the strip, but drinks are over priced (although I got free drink cards which was nice, but my hubby had to pay (standard Vegas)), patio to view the strip is tiny and crowded. We had a drink, took a pic and left, wasn't much to it. Other random bars in the hotel are standard and okay, nothing to write home about. 

Hotel: pretty clean, but freezing anywhere you go. Abnormally cold! 

Aquarium: it was pretty, fish and sharks were cool. I feel like it could be nicer, more colorful and cleaner, especially since I am a scuba diver (have dove all over the world) and love the underwater life. It's much more colorful and vibrant in the wild, so they need to redo and revamp the aquarium, big time. The poor Alligator and Kumono Dragon looked very sad, their habitats could be a 100 times nicer and bigger for them, especially considering it cost $20\/person to get in the place and these poor animals are stuck here for life. They need a major, major overhaul and remodel. Those gorgeous animals deserve WAY BETTER! PETA should go check it out and raise some major hell b\/c it seems unfair to me. I am a huge animal lover and to see those two animals look depressed was heartbreaking and maddening. The beautiful fish also deserve better. Their needs to be more educational information pipping through the speakers, a guide or info on the animals and how we could all do a better job of helping take care of our wild life and planet. It's not like the MGM company doesn't have the $$$.

Michael Jackson show is AMAZING! Probably hands down the Best thing about the entire hotel. If you are an MJ fan go see it, if you aren't-go see it, you will be after. They do him justice, it's a very entertaining and awesome show!!

All in all: Stay somewhere else, but if you want to see a show, journey here for dinner-recommend Kumi (if you like sushi) and go see the Michael Jackson show. Then go back to your hotel or somewhere else to enjoy your night.",7,6,6

I am a AA male, a M life member, & a director within a major medical research site. I possess a MBA from a top 25, a second masters in clinical psychology, and have been accepted to transition to medical school. I state these credentials to say if I can have the following interaction at M. Bay, then anyone of color might can. I visited M. Bay on the evening of 5\/3\/15. My thought was that in the 13 years of visiting Vegas while living in Cali, I had not had the pleasure of spending time there. Upon arriving, my cigar, my drink, and I proceeded to the craps table. Well, at some point I guess it was deemed that my end of the table was too rambunctious, which was quite tame for craps in comparison to MGM and others. As a result, a staff at the table comes up to me only and states, ""This is not the ghetto. Watch your language"". Ridiculous! I presume that he'd thought that I'd used the word ""mfer"", which was not the case. One of the Caucasian gents next to me admitted to using the wording but nevertheless. Upon the staff's statement, I immediately proclaimed, ""Did you just use the word ghetto in referencing me? I'm pretty sure I'm the most educated one at this table!"" And I proceeded to inform him just how my conclusion was pretty accurate. The Caucasian party next to me expressed their disapproval of his approach at which he gave a half-hearted apology. The game continued. Ten minutes later, I responded ""S**t"" at an unsettling 7 being rolled and a new staff member, presumably the pit manager named Anthony, then comes to me and says, ""You've been warned of your language already. The next time, I'll need to restrict you from the table."" Since when has ""s**t"" been off limits at a craps table? Interesting to say the least. At one point, I move a couple steps back from the table to check my texts and the Anthony again approaches and states that I can't text by the table. I turn to him and respond, ""Anthony, what's the deal? I'm away from the table, minding my business."" He then responds, ""yeah, but you're close to the pit"". I respond, ""But that's not what you said. If you'd simply asked that I move more to my left then that would've been understandable"". His response, ""That's what I was saying. Why be so angry?"" What's funny is that I was most calm at the moment, but before he actually felt my anger I chose to move on to another casino. Could it be that the staff were overwhelmed with Mayweather fight weekend? Maybe. In my experience never are these isolated incidents, especially this blatant. Nevertheless, good customer service should be a requirement not an option no matter who I may or may not be. I won't ever visit M. Bay again in my lifetime and have expressed such to the doctors\/staff I work with, as well as family and friends.",5,1,1

I walked over to play poker because they had a few 1\/2 NL games going. Got to a pretty good table, everybody was getting along pretty well. 

During one hand, a guy went all in and the guy sitting next to me quizzically looked at him and said ""all-in?"" The dealer who referred to herself as a ""stickler for rules"" announced that he had just announced he was all in - it was clear to the entire table that this was not his intention. However, if that's he rule, that's the rule and I'm fine with that. 

What I'm not ok with is how the floor manager handled it. He backed the ruling of the dealer (which is fine, if that's the rule, that's the rule) however, everybody, including the guy on the OTHER end of the all-in was complaining about the ruling (oh by the way, he won the hand) the floor manager announced that this was not up for discussion and that if the players didn't show their hands, their hands would be folded. (First the guy that was called and subsequently the caller) I can't remember his name, but he was very rude and dismissive. 

I picked up my chips and left the game. He was rude and dismissive to me as well when I told him why. I explained that even though there are hard and fast rules, he still owes an explanation to the players, who are his customers. He had no interest in hearing what I had to say and told me to take his ""bosses card."" I told him it didn't matter, I would just take my money elsewhere. I took $500 off that table, which isn't a lot of money, but it's not a small amount for a 1\/2 game either.",12,5,8

I'll admit that for every time I've stayed at this resort it's been a result of a complimentary night, but in the last 3 years of staying here I can certainly tell that things have changed (and not necessarily in a good way either.)

* AMENITIES *
One of my favorite perks of staying at Mandalay Bay is their amenities. I'm not sure when they stopped offering it, but for a while they were the only resort to offer L'Occitane bathroom amenities along with dental kits! Now they've reverted to Kuer, a branded soap by MGM resorts. Slightly disappointed but I guess it's not a dealbreaker. 

* SKY VIEW SUITE *
On my first ever trip to Vegas, my friends and I decided to go big and stayed at this 1050sq ft room with 2 queens and 1.5 bathrooms. We loved it because we were at about 56 floors high and it also had a wet bar with a full refrigerator! 

* DELUXE QUEEN WITH POOL VIEW *
On my second stay, we stayed here and were still relatively impressed with the room. I do love the whirlpool tub and his and her sinks. 

* DELUXE KING WITH STRIP VIEW*
On my most recent stay, we got the strip view and, considering it was a holiday weekend, were pleasantly surprised that we were able to score this room. For some odd reason it felt much smaller in comparison to the other times I've stayed here, which I will admit has played a part in my being disappointed, but the stay was still a rather pleasant one. In this room, unfortunately, they did NOT have a whirlpool tub. 

* SHOPPING & DINING *
Like all resorts, you'll find your local Starbucks here alongside the resort's house buffet and a plethora of other dining options. Mandalay Bay also has its own shopping center called The Shoppes, which is attached to the Luxor hotel and offers high-end retail stores and several other full-service restaurants. 
I distinctly remember ordering takeout at the pizza restaurant which was conveniently placed next to the Fat Tuesday counter!

* GETTING AROUND *
Mandalay Bay marks the end of the South strip and as such, is the most painful to get to and back. They do offer a free tram that runs through Luxor and Excalibur, but on your way from Excalibur they feature an express tram that goes straight back to Mandalay Bay. These trams DO NOT stay open all night. I was fortunate enough to check online before making the trek back here via tram after a night of clubbing, so make sure to look!

--
Overall, Mandalay Bay is still a great hotel to stay in, but not the first one I would choose. You get wonderful amenities and square footage here, but you could argue that other resorts could offer similar things as well.

Mandalay Bay is pretty casino\/hotel. I've never stayed in the hotel here and my review is mainly for the way in which the events were handled. I booked a trip to Vegas in December 2011 to see the Michael Jackson Immortal World Tour by Cirque Du Soleil which was playing here. I stopped by the ticket pick up area (convention center) a day before the show in order to make sure I had our tickets in advance. After standing in line and getting up to the desk, the woman at the counter stated that I didn't need to pick up any tickets and that my computer generated receipt that I had printed out when purchasing the tickets would act as our tickets. So my bf and I went on to party & gamble in Vegas until the next day when we arrived a little early for the show. As to be expected there were literally hundreds of people in line for the show and after waiting 40 minutes we had finally made it to the security checkpoint where I we had to go through metal detectors & have my purse checked. After waiting some more we finally got to the ticket scanner and were informed that the computer confirmations were NOT our tickets and that we had to go to the ticket booth to pick them up. So once again we got at the END of the line (which was still as long as it was when we first started) and waited to get to the ticket booth (which I visited in advance the previous day) Another 30 minutes go by and the show was scheduled to start. Only after complaining to the Mandalay bay security gaurds did anyone acknowledge the hotels mistake. They said we wouldn't miss ""that much"" of the show :\/ after getting the correct tickets, going through security, and finding our seats, the $200 per person show was ten minutes into their routine. We were late at no fault of our own. The hotel needs to communicate and educate their staff more appropriately. People like me save up for trips like this and don't have time to waste for someone else's mistakes!",2,2,0

Finally checked in for our two rooms, 25-215 & 25-217, I tried to upgrade to the two bedroom suites but they were not available. It was my daughters 25th and fathers' 65th b-day vacation. I was informed by the man who checked me in that my dad can get free parking for both cars if he gets a M-life card, so we did. My father is a Vietnam veteran and has PTSD and is a paranoid schizophrenic so it is hard to get him to leave the house, but he decided he wanted to go to Vegas.  When we exited the elevator on the 25th floor there was an overwhelming odor of marijuana. Didn't think too much of it and thought it would dissipate. I had my 16 year old daughter with me. When we opened the door to room 25-215 it was almost completely filled with smoke from the ""pot"". We went to the other room 25-217, and it wasn't as bad but still smokey. I immediately went back to check-in. Waited again in the 1  1\/2 hour line to switch rooms. I informed by the lady that they should make sure the room is ok for the next guest and she said they will put in a ""bomb"" to allow for the smoke and smell to leave, before they put in any guests. I was moved to 22-203 & 22-217 (way to far apart.) I was given ""temporary keys"" for the rooms on the 25th floor to retrieve our luggage. Before I was able to get back up to the 25th floor my 16 year old daughter meet me in the hallway on floor 25 and said that another guest just walked into room 25-215, they had a key, as she was changing and getting her luggage. HOW CAN YOU CHECK IN ANOTHER GUEST WHILE THE ROOM IS STILL OCCUPIED? We managed to get our luggage from both rooms and went to our new rooms. Still way far apart. Again, I went back to the check in line, only about an hour wait this time, and told the same lady who switched our rooms what had happened. She then got a manager and I was comped two nights. Not good enough but by this time we were all exhausted and just wanted to relax. I kept my dad in 22-203 since it was closer to the elevator. He was complaining that the AC was barely working and it was hot, so he just wet towels to cool off. We put a do not disturb sign on the door, and still the house keeper came  in and made the beds.  Loved the pool, too hot for my dad and the cabana rental was too expensive, so he was basically in the room the entire trip. Stayed our two nights, and as we were leaving Saturday morning, we had to pay $24 per car to leave. DID NOT HAVE THE FREE PARKING LIKE WE WERE TOLD.

My television didn't work.  I called the front desk and explained that it wasn't working.  Maintenance called me back and came up to repair.  I told him I didn't have much time because we had dinner reservations.  He said it would be quick.  It ended up being a significant problem and we missed our dinner reservations.  The worst part that was that I walked out of the room to go into the bathroom.  When I came back in there were 3 people having sex on the TV.  My little girls (8 and 11) were laying there on the bed in shock!  I went to the front desk and asked to speak to a manager.  She gave me a free dinner credit for missing my reservations, which was nice, but really didn't seem to care about what happened on the TV.  She was young and clearly didn't realize the impact something like this has on children.  To make a long story short, we spent the night with our children explaining the details of sex and why it should only be two people, a man and a woman...  It was not a fun night and not how we anticipated spending our family trip.  

The manager didn't seem to understand why it was a problem.  She was very young and while many adults may not have a major issue with it, these things stick in kid's minds and they couldn't stop talking about it all trip and were upset.

The rooms are great and you can usually get great deals online. They always have great concerts going on and in the summer they have concerts out at the pool which is like a beach. They have stuff for the kiddos to do like the Shark Reef. 

The restaurants are straight up awesome! My favorite restaurant at Mandalay Bay is Red Square. I love all of the Vodka and just the Russian feel. 

The service in this hotel is always on point. Everyone is helpful and it is also very easy to get around. it is a big hotel but you do not feel like you are lost in space.

Oh and it smells nice in there. It does not smell of old nasty smokes, even though it is an old casino for Vegas standards.",4,1,3

As some of you already know, MGM is now taking advantage of customers on parking. For this location, it is now $10 a day (or a 24 hour period). Local Vegas residents will have a grace period until the end of the year.  If by chance you had booked your trip prior to early May's announcement on parking, your parking fee will be waived. Your room key will serve as your pass to get through the gates at the hotel, as well as other MGM hotels during your stay. 

For the newer remodeled rooms, the decor is modern and minimalistic. The TV on the wall is clear, the wireless internet is decent at 10Mbit sec, and the cardio room (which is literallyi a bunch of threadmills, exercycles, and a few free weights) are all okay and what your $33.60 resort fees go into.  Oh, there is a water machine there, a must need for hydration. 

The elevator doors that close here is slow, you can literally count 10 seconds until it closes. I do recommend hitting the close button if you're semi-impatient like me. 

The pool here is the best thing if traveling with children. The lazy river is simple, takes about 3 minutes per lap with a small waterfall in between. The wave pool is 48 inches minimum. There is no reserving chairs, as I found out putting my towels out early in the day but there is plenty of open chairs during the weekday. Cabanas can run you somewhere between 250-450 per day, which I thought was a little crazy since it costs more than the cost of a daily room.  Oh, and there are 2 water dispensers by the restaurants which is awesome so you can refill your bottles.

We utilized the MLife booth for some freebies. If you want to use the rewards for buffet (see my other review for Bayside), you'll have to use it the same day. 

Overall, a stay here was great. For the most part it was quiet in the halls until 3am. There is a closed door to the bathroom, a shower, a tub, 2 sinks, 2 closets in a room over 500 sq. feet. I would totally stay here again even though we have to pay the redonculous resort charges and parking the next time I stay here.",10,3,4

One of the main reasons we wanted to stay here was because their pool area has a lazy river. Well, it was extra lazy on our trip and wasn't open. The pool attendants weren't giving straight answers as to if it would be open the next day either. We were only in town for two full days so that was a wash.

* Beach Towels
* Flip Flops
* Comfy sundress or shorts & a lite shirt
* Lite jacket (desert weather permitting)
* $
* swimwear  (optional)

Totally chill venue when it's an older crowd such as Huey Lewis or the Beach Boys, John Stamos guest appears.  I also went to Steel Pulse which was a chill, younger crowd so I'd like to do more reggae concerts in the future!  

If it's your first time, kick off your shoes & walk in the sand.  Pick a spot you want to dance from or place your beach towel so you can see the stage.  The stage is in the middle area of the water.  
It's always a great atmosphere for a bucket of beer, which they no longer do.  The drinks are good, expensive & they serve frozen margaritas & food. 

I like walking around the joint & mingling.  Chit chatting w\/ locals & tourists, singing together & dancing.  If your feeling adventurous, get in the water.  There were kids there swimming when we went.  

The event lasted about an hour & a half or so.  If you can't find a parking at Mandalay, head to the new convention parking garage that you can access from the main registration entrance & follow the signs.  Easy!  I actually like it more than my usual parking around the hotel to the Delano & MB valet\/parking.

I called the guest services to make sure we weren't billed for anything but she scorned us as well, saying ""you really aren't supposed to park there."" We didn't know. The sign says ""valet registration"" to the left, so we parked there and went to check in at the desk.

I understand policy, rules, signs. But is a small misunderstanding worth towing our car while we are checking in at the front desk? They were so paranoid about a strange car parked in their zone that they yelled at paying customers who aren't privy to the staff's particularities.

Elevators: The elevator service was horrible. The doors would not close in a timely manner without having to depress the door-close button. There were 8 elevators servicing the 2-16 floor, and I never saw more than 2 elevators running at a given time. And finally, there were 4-5 times when we entered the elevator and it did nothing. We were standing in the open elevator for several minutes before realizing that it was probably out of service. Seems like a trivial gripe, but it was very irritating for us (and other guests)

Fitness: In all my travels, I've NEVER had to pay to work out. At Mandalay Bay, I had to pay $25 per day just to lift for 45 minutes. Heck, I can work out every day for a month and a half at Golds Gym for $25. And on top of the $25, I STILL had to pay the 15% ""resort"" fee. What a joke!! And the daytime manager (I will refrain from mentioning his name), didn't even credit me the stupid $25 bucks. He said he couldn't refund that (of course his non-verbal facial blushing let me to believe he was lying). You would think that after dumping more than $3K at the tables, he would have showed me a little relief...I didn't need the $25 bucks, but just on principal and courtesy.

The television was a flatscreen and it was sweet to just be in the room. We had a view of the street below on the 32nd floor, along with the view of the Mandalay Bay logo on the building.  The bathroom was nice too, separated toilet and shower. This is luxury living right here.

The hotel itself was grand, as all Las Vegas Strip properties seem to be. Loving the Starbucks location within the property, although there were multiple properties with the exact same thing. Yay for Starbucks!! I didn't play at the casino, as I was trying to do Vegas on a budget. The casino was clean and civil, although I have heard some screams of victory from some tables, but all in all, it was a well kept establishment.

I would have liked to stay here longer, even though I don't gamble.  I liked the fact that the Mandalay Bay was gold. Makes it really stand out, versus the other properties along the Strip.

It's beautifully gold leafed windows makes it stick out and it's an incredible sight for sure. When flying into or out of Mccarran Airport, Mandalay Bay (and Luxor) are the most prominent Hotels you will see. Mandalay Bay is located on the far south end of the Strip almost directly across from McCarran Airport. This is absolutely a luxury resort.

The Mandalay Bay sits on the site where the Hacienda Hotel and Casino once stood. I use to like the Hacienda. At one time the Hacienda even had its own airline. But it had run its Las Vegas course and was being over taken by all the new mega resorts and casinos being built on the strip including the recently opened Luxor next door. So it was time for this 40 year old legend to go. 

In 1995 Circus Circus Enterprises our purchased the Hacienda and closed it in December 1996 and finally in January 1997 the Hacienda was imploded after 40 years in business. But it refused to die (See pictures), part of the Hacienda didn't come down when imploded. 

The Mandalay Bay opened in March of 1999. The Mandalay Bay Convention Center opened in January 2003 and at the time was the 5th largest convention center in the United States and one of the largest privately own convention centers in the world. 

Ok pay attention now because all this gets a little complex. In 1999 Circus Circus changed its name to Mandalay Resort Group and then in 2005 Mandalay Resort Group was sold to MGM Mirage and then eventually MGM Resorts International. 

So then as we go on, in 2002 a second tower began construction. At the time of its opening in December 2003 the second Tower was called the Hotel at Mandalay Bay and look just like the Mandalay Bay but just a single tower and in fact it said ""Mandalay Bay'' on it just like the main Hotel. Then in 2006 the tower changed it name to ""The Hotel"" and one more name change for you, in 2012 the second tower to Delano. All of the room here are suites. The smallest suites are 750 Square feet. Penthouses run between 1,500 to 2,500 square feet. It had a 4,500 sq. Ft. Presidential Suite.

Let's go back the the main Mandalay Bay Hotel. 5 floors within the Mandalay Bay building, floors 35-39 are occupied by the 5 star and AAA 5 Diamond Four Seasons Hotel. Yep a hotel within a hotel. 

There are 24 restaurants in the hotel I've eaten at several of them and this trip we ate at the Bayside Buffet here (See my review). I like the Burger Bar and the Beach Bar and Grill. Red Square is good and they have a kool statue with no head out front. (See my pictures). 

There is a monorail\/ tram that connects the Mandalay Bay to the Luxor and the Excalibur. There is a long walkway bridge going towards the Luxor that leads to the Shoppes at Mandalay Place. Lots of very nice stores and restaurants. This is where some of those 24 restaurants are located. 

The shark reef here is kool with over 1,000 species there and it's HUGE. Don't worry about the other fish and aquatic life is safe from being eaten by the sharks because they are feed more than in the wild. So, they don't munch on the other fish and stuff. Prices are $20 for adults, $18 for seniors and $14 for kids. Kids are 4-12 so teens pay adult price. Under 4 are free. 

My favorite part of the Mandalay Bay is the pool or Mandalay Beach. I think this is in my opinion the best pool in Las Vegas and I've seen them all. I have been to many pool parties here and they are amazing. The pool area is 11 acres HUGE HUGE HUGE. Some of the pool are heated and one of them is open all year. There is a big wave pool that has waves of two to four feet, really nice. There is a lazy river and a pool for children. There is also an over 21 pool that is separated from the other pools by smoked glass where women can go topless if they want. You haven't been to  ""Vegas"" party until you've been to a pool party here.

The gaming floor is huge too with plenty of table games and lots. It has a decent sports book too. This hotel has been kept up better than some of the other strip hotels of the same age. It's very clean and nice. I've never had an issue with customer service it always been above average since it opened. It's just a really nice place throughout and very safe. I like it a lot and I will definitely be back again.

For me the only downside is it's location on the strip, it's at the far south end and is a bit of a hike to get to say the Bellagio Fountains for example. If you don't want to walk a lot, you can take the tram to the Excalibur then cross over Tropicana Blvd which will bring you to the New York New York Hotel and  Casino and walk from there.",56,26,42

However, after booking a weekend package through Expedia for this resort & airfare, I was pleasantly surprised. For starters, I was only there two nights in the winter, with the beach area and pool closed, so can't speak to many of the amenities or the comfort of a lengthier stay. For a weekend, it's completely fine. It seems a bit less chaotic than some neighboring resorts and while it is located on the far end of the strip, it's a quick & easy Uber ride to anywhere else you need to go nearby. They have a dedicated pick up\/drop off site downstairs for taxis and car services. 
At the time I arrived (around 3 on a Friday,) check in went pretty smooth and was fast. The lobby was clean and bright and everything seemed pretty modern compared to other resorts on that part of Las Vegas Blvd. The main issue I had with my room was the overwhelming scent of air freshener. It was heavy in the air and not exactly pleasant to breathe in. While it got better over the course of our stay, I wasn't sure if it because I got used to it or the scent dissipated. 
Bathroom was clean, spacious and bed was comfy. The staff was friendly and check out also a breeze. The resort, at least in Winter, seemed a bit more low key and less chaotic which for me, was right up my alley. I also got to use the Cardio Center which had a good number of treadmills, elliptical machines, bikes and an array of free weights. I was able to squeeze in a decent workout with plenty of room to navigate and not feel rushed on my machines.

Overall everything was well but I think staying here once will be enough for us. The reason? There were WAY too many lifeguards. The problem with this is you can't dive, you can't run or walk along the wave action pool, you can't stand by the wave to get hit in the face with a wave, which I actually wanted, you can't take a raft to the lazy river. FFS! Tubes only in the lazy river and good luck finding a chair after noon because you probably won't. The pools also close at 7pm so no sexy time in the jacuzzi late night. We opted out on the cabanas but found a couple of chairs our first and 3rd day but our 2nd day, we had to lay on the sand. If you only want a jacuzzi minus the kids, I suggest you walk to the south lagoon for the jacuzzi hot tub there. You can relax there if you don't have kids. Anyways, this place still gets a 4 star from me. Safety is important and they can't help the crowds. It's a very fun resort and another wonderful casino floor plan from this company.",1,0,1

My husband and I did a staycation here in August for Fri\/Sat night. The check in process was a bit slow, as to why, I wasn't sure because they had plenty of people working.

We were placed on the 18th floor with a view of the pool area. I hadn't requested a specific view, and it cost extra anyway so meh. 

The room we had was a King Deluxe, I believe. It had a large shower and a separate tub. The bed was extremely comfy, and had many pillow and a nice fluffy comforter. Everything was cleaned up nicely on the days we stayed.

I have zero complaints about the room, honestly, it was one of the nicest places I have ever stayed period. We also ordered room service which was so quick I couldn't believe it. And although the prices are what you would expect, the food was quite good.

On our second morning there I went down to a small cafe that is located just outside the guest elevators for coffees and bagels. These were decent as well, although put quite a dent in my pocket book! Ugh, Strip prices!

Overall I really enjoyed our staycation here. I will certainly recommend Mandalay Bay to anyone looking for a nice place to stay in Vegas.",2,3,2

I know she must have been hearing the frustration from everyone. Guess what we all had to wait in line for 3 hours in line we are tired and frustrated and it's almost 10:30. Missed our dinner reservation. When I asked about the room she said its all we have you will have to take it.  What's most upsetting is that there where only 6 people checking people in.

For me its good that it sits so far from the center strip chaos... but for others it may be too quiet. It does connect to Luxor and Excaliber which I found really multiplied the food and shopping options...I liked all the choices!
One thing I hated was all the plastic greenery through MB...many other hotels use real plants...yuck.
Another negative...the pool area looks like a crowded nightmare with children racing all over the place...yuck.
Shark reef....really needs updating...
We did alright in the casino...one some, lost some...its above average in its size and selection.

The wave pool is a lot of fun.  I can only do so much laying by the pool reading and drinking...So this pool provides the activity I need.  The sand is a nice added touch too.  

Decent selection of restaurants on site and in the connected Mandalay Place.  There are 2 Starbucks and a decently priced burger place - Burger Bar.  

Another added plus - There is a Lush store in Mandalay Place.  Go there, buy a 5 dollar bath bomb and enjoy your soaking tub!!

Check in was a little slow moving, but the staff at check in was very friendly and wanted to make sure that you were aware of everything that they offered and wanted to make sure that all your questions were answered. It was nice, but did make check in take a little bit of extra time

The room was pretty comfortable size for the base room, but the view was meh as we just had a view of the airport and a very small view of the Luxor and MGM. The beds were pretty comfortable and the bathroom was nice and spacious.

The casino was nice and it looked good walking around and gambling. I couldnt win anything on any machines or tables, but my friends did pretty well.

The shoppes inside were great! The shoppes connect to the Luxor Hotel (FYI the Luxor has the worst smell ever!!). The hotel is located at the southern end of the Las Vegas Strip. I found it to be a nice part of the strip, considering there were no homeless, cartoon characters, naked showgirls or people passing out prostitution cards in front of the hotel. It is within walking distance of everything on the strip, depending on how much you are willing to walk. From the Mandalay to the Ventian and Treausre Island is about a 3 mile walk each way.

My bf and I stayed here the week of Memorial Day week. We were so excited about the Mandalay Bay and had high expectations. We booked the room that included a $75 meal credit which we thought was awesome. At check-in we were told to just charge it to the room to get the meal credit. I received the statement after check-out and the credit was not given to us. It got charged to my credit card. The next day I contacted their accounting department to fix this mistake, and it's been 2 weeks and it still hasn't been resolved. What a headache. I'm not sure why it's so difficult and taking so long.

The room:
I asked for a non-smoking room on the 9th floor (which is supposed to be all non-smoking). But as soon as we opened the door it smelled like smoke. I immediately called and asked to change rooms. The customer service representative wasn't nice, kinda moody. I expect more from Mandalay Bay. When we finally switched rooms I was so excited to try out the king bed. It was just eh. It felt old, not comfy, there was a noticeable dip in the middle, the comforter and bedding seemed low quality, the decorative pillows smelled funky, and they didn't provide an assortment of pillows to chose from like other hotels. So that was a let down. (The bed at TI is heavenly). In the bathroom there's a separate shower and tub, which is nice. The shower stall itself seemed a little small though. And, there's a see-through window next to the tub that looks out into the hall. I'm not sure what the purpose of that is, and there aren't any blinds to close it. I prefer more privacy in the bathroom, especially if there are other guests in the room and you don't want them to see you naked in the bathroom.  The toilet is located in a separate room, which is nice. Watch out when you flush the toilet, it's loud and powerful and will wake people up. Speaking of noise, you can hear every noise coming from the  bathroom, even with the doors closed. The doors are similar to closet doors that you have to pull hard to close shut and it's so loud when you shut the doors. There's a huge gap under the doors and between the doors. And EVERY door in that room creaked, they all needed WD40.

The pools:
Lots of kids running around. Crowded. Seemed hectic. No 'beach bodies' anywhere.  Lazy river seemed fast, not very lazy, and very crowded. I was excited to try it out, until I saw it. The river at MGM is wayyyy better.

The Restaurant:
Red Light was AWESOME! excellent food (although small portions), very cool decor, very expensive, but had a great time.

Light nightclub:
Very impressed by the venue and the dancers. They put on a good show. Music was good, but just techno beat and then after a while gets kinda old, but it was still good.

I come to Las Vegas every year and have stayed in almost all of the higher end hotels on the strip and My family and I decided to try the Mandalay Bay. First, we went to breakfast at the Sea Breeze Cafe (big mistake). My mom and I both had things with lobster in them, I had the lobster sliders and my mom had the lobster omelet. We were planning on checking out that morning but we were struck with terrible food poisoning a half an hour after our meal. Next, we called the front desk, or tried, we were on hold for a half and hour and got hung up on twice. When we finally reached someone they told us they couldn't do anything and just told us to file a security report. Then we called the restaurant and the manager (Anthony) was the coldest, rudest, and most unhelpful person we've come in contact with in a higher end hotel. We asked to refund the meal AT LEAST and he said, and I quote ""well that not gonna happen."" Unapologetic and very unprofessional. THEN we asked to have an extended stay comped because we could no longer drive home (which was 7 hours away) and they refused and were not kind. The only one who was kind was the operator, Barbra.

The manager (Edward) was the coldest and most unapologetic manager I've ever come in contact with. Not only did he not provide a resolution, but he was condescending and acted uninterested in even listening to my complaint. I'm not sure who Edward's manager is, but he needs thorough training on customer service. 

The room was nice aside from the several random hairs that were strewn throughout the sheets once I pulled them back. I did have issues with the cable constantly having signal issues also.

Based on the horrible customer service alone I don't think I'd ever stay at this property again. I only gave it two stars because of the room (besides the hair).",4,2,1

As a 40-ish guy, its on the verge of what I'm looking for in Vegas.  Then again, all of Vegas is heading that way.  Generally, I'd say the Mandalay Bay is perfect for folks between their mid-20's and mid-30's with money in their pocket.

Pools are great, although packed when it's a good pool day.  I got the feeling that there were plenty of folks there who weren't necessarily guests--but I could be wrong.  Overall, though, this place is perfect if you are looking for pools.  Were I one of those mid-20's to mid-30's guys with a better body, I'd feel like i fit in more--but such is life.

Plenty of restaurants abound inside--most of which are pretty overpriced. That said, having eaten at just about all of them, I've never had what I would call a bad experience by Vegas standards.  Quality foods, upscale atmosphere, and you can't beat the easy walk.  

Casino is upscale and with higher mins as you would expect with the decor\/atmosphere.  Table play was fun and a bit classier than MGM Grand.  Totally worthwhile atmosphere if you are able to afford the higher mins, otherwise I'd head further down the strip--which is easy to do with the monorail going between Mandalay, Luxor (next door) and down to Excalibur (past Luxor and down the street). 

In the MGM empire (which Mandalay is a part of), this rates just below MGM-Grand (perhaps on par), yet above Luxor, and far above Excalibur.  For my money, I think I'll stay at MGM-Grand next time around unless Mandalay Bay makes it worth my while in comps via the Players Club (which is excellent, by the way!)",1,0,0

Bathroom has double vanity, a bathtub, a shower with a separate door to the toilet.  There is a tray with drinks and snacks for purchase (even coffee which is usually complimentary was $4). Wifi worked fine.

There is a great variety of restaurants in the lobby including a more upscale Aureole, to Hubert Kelly's Fleur, to a more casual House of Blues...

Hillary at the Front Desk checked me in and was very helpful and friendly. 

Unfortunately, the big mandalay beach and pool were closed for the season.

Make sure to check out the Foundation Room on their top floor for great views of the strip at night!

I'm not sure if it was part of the Mandalay or just in the connector section but it has a bunch of really cool restaurants and lounges (eyecandy, bayside buffet, shanghai lilly, j-pop, etc). There was this really cool wine bar\/restaurant that had a wine elevator made of glass. Very snazzy.

My brother and I shared a one bedroom with 2 Queen sized beds. We didn't actually come up to our room until 3:30 AM. The bathroom had no towels, no shampoo, there was a used floss pick stuck to the mirror. Housekeeping did not do a very good job at cleaning. Also, there was poop on the wall. I was thoroughly disgusted and wanted to change rooms, but unfortunately it was really late, I was tired and my brother was already asleep in the bed. 

In the morning, I asked him if he had used the glass cup that was sitting on the table next to the tv because there was water in it. He said that it was already there when he came into the room. I then realized the room had never been cleaned at all. I called to the front desk to ask for a new room and to complain about the messy room. The lady said our room wouldn't be ready until after 3pm. Luckily, we had family staying in a suite and moved our stuff up to their room until our room was ready. The lady at the front desk said she  would waive the resort fees for the day. Pretty upset because I realized I had been sleeping in sheets that someone else had stayed in and who knows what was done in those sheets!!! Ick!

We rented a cabana at the pool and spent the day there. The pool was nice and the service was great. The hotel called us around 3:30 to let us know that our room was ready. In the morning, my brother woke up to bites on his body and actually killed a bug on the floor.

We rented a cabana, spent about $2k at RM Seafood, and gambled in their casino. At check out, we reported what had happened in our room and so they waived one night's stay. After this experience, we won't be back.",7,0,0

Clearly, you can imagine my surprise at experiencing the upgrade.  But luckily for me, I think the review is fairly justified.  Service was great (on a Tuesday) with kind customer service from beginning to end.  The elevators were prompt, the room was clean, the view was gorgeous (looking over the awesome pools of Mandalay Bay) and there's a good amount of things to do in the actual hotel from the fairly nice\/spacious casino to the good shows (Lion King isn't there anymore unfortunately but I hear alright things about the new Michael Jackson show) and good food (China Bistro...although we didn't pay for it, was extraordinary). 

The double bed room included a TV, ironing board, phones in the restroom and bedroom, and a bathtub\/shower along with hairdryer and supposedly the DVD player is free (although something must've been off since we never got it).  There's an aquarium downstairs that looks amazing and again, the pools seem like some of the best on the strip. 

The worst part about the whole experience is simply that it's at the very end of the Strip, yet compared to Circus Circus (ha ha, I know), the walk isn't that far and does connect easily with Luxor.

I've had a few days since returning home from Vegas, so I've had some time to cool off. I took this trip with girlfriends, and it wasn't exactly my thing, but I can go with the flow and drink and gamble a night a way! It was 4 AM and we were meeting back up and heading back to our room. I had a different little handbag for the evening, with only my wallet and new iPhone 4 in it. Since this bag doesn't close well, I'm thinking my phone slipped out at the last slot machine I was at - good thing it wasn't my wallet. 

Anyway, this nice older man gave my husband a call. He was funny and seemed so proud to have found this phone! I'm sure they made fun of me, and I'm SO NOT that stupid drunk girl - I never lose stuff like this. Anyway, he said, he was going to leave my phone at the front desk.

Long story short - next day, I go by the front desk. I believe I spoke with Randy, who was uber-rude that I was not there to check in. I told him the situation, and he said, if he were in my shoes, he would go to lost and found. Fine, I said - sounds logical - can you tell me where that is? Rolling his eyes, he explains that I can't go there, I have to go back to the casino, to the security desk and have them call L&F. If you've never been to Vegas, these hotels are ginormous! I don't know where to go exactly - thanks for being a friend Randy! So, I go find said security desk - no love there. I ask to use their phone to call my phone, and the guy starts asking me where I'm calling. Its freakin' Mandalay Bay, in a casino, where I can literally hear them making $$!! Worry, about my little call - re-damn-diculous! 

I'm now convinced that the nice old guy, who could've taken my phone and not called my husband, took my phone to the front desk - where it was somehow stolen by a MB employee on its way to the Lost & Found.

Isn't the North strip home to the boarded up Sahara? The Fontainebleau Las Vegas that never even opened? And lest we forget the opulent Circus Circus? The South Strip is where the action is! And it has fewer of those nasty card peddlers!

The crown gem of the South Strip is obviously Mandalay Bay Resort! Just walking in you can smell your in a different world. Marble and other expensive building materials are everywhere! And the outside of the building is acres and acres of exotic waterfalls, sculpture gardens and trees! And unlike Wynn (NICE but North Strip) Mandalay Bay has real grass and plants. Even the Palazzo is using fake plants these days. What's with that? Anyway - the grounds look and feel expensive because it cost a fortune to build. And it's comfortable and quiet in most of the public spaces except the pool area (second to none) and the exciting casino.

This resort underwent a room renovation a few years ago to kill off the beach bungalow look and removed any trace of of a tropical theme. The new room decor is bright, modern and welcoming! Sound-proofing is good and the bathroom is massive and includes two sinks and an HDTV.

Some people say that visitors to Las Vegas don't spend time in thier room. WRONG again! Why do you think the rooms and suites keep getting bigger and more plush? Because people do spend time in their rooms relaxing and entertaining or maybe even kicked back on the bed watching a high-def movie. Ask anyone who has spent a lot of time at the nicer resorts and they will tell you that the floor to ceiling glass curtain wall provides the most spectacular views of the strip. The whole strip just unfolds in front of you at night.

The resort is also home to one of the worlds largest convention centers and it's own event\/concert center. And every food choice imaginable is available either at the resort, at Mandalay Place or a quick tram-ride to Luxor, Excalibur, NYNY and the MGM Grand. And unlike the Las Vegas monorail the tram is free and better located. You have to walk miles to catch the monorail.

The only thing I noticed on my last trip that needed some attention was the parking garage. It used to be kept cleaner but I noticed empty beer and other liquor bottles scattered around. Guess I wasn't invited to the party!

I've only seen the massive pool area a few times, but it includes a lazy river, a wave pool, beach, and numerous pools including a more adult one. The pool complex would be awesome if they could just nix the children completely (especially the loud ones) but some resorts must bear the burden of accommodating children. But Las Vegas is NOT a family destination. 

I've enjoyed this resort for many years and plan on returning again soon. Be sure to see the photos.

Room Tip: High floor room facing the strip!

Side Note: I have not been in a year and refused to go, until they do an early cancellation of a Michael Jackson show. He frightens children and most adults and is dead.",3,3,5

However, a work conference was held at the Mandalay Bay convention center, so it made sense to stay at the same hotel and minimize traveling around.

I must give the hotel credit for being quite well-run.  The room was large enough and had plenty of closet space, and the view of the strip and the airport from the 26th floor was quite impressive.  

To give on example of being well-run, let me point to check-in.  I arrived at 11 AM on a Saturday morning to find a very long line for check-in.  Those early morning flights from the East Coast arrive around that time, so I should not have been surprised.  I thought that I would wait in line for an hour and find out that no rooms were available until the 3 PM check-in time.  Then I would have to check my bags with the valet and wander around for a few hours.

Well, I was wrong on all accounts.  The wait was maybe 30 minutes.  They had rooms available and were able to put me on the side away from the pool and the loud Sunday night pool parties.  And the hotel was not really any louder than other ones I have stayed in.  So, I wouild stay here again and recommend it to anyone else.",4,1,1

Let me say that this place is classy and it has a more older appeal but that doesn't mean that its boring.  The hotel is large, its clean and it has everything you could want in a Vegas Resort.  I came here for a convention for work but that didn't stop me from having a little fun.  The Casino is large and they have an awesome Sports book area.  You can walk over to the Luxor, which is right next door, in a connected walkway.  They have shops, pool area, and anything else you can imagine.  

Now I hear some people on here gripe about the monitoring of food and drinks and what not in your room and its true...they have sensors on the items and if you remove it then it charges that item to your room.  Now if you didn't use the item and put it back it will still be charged to your room if you didn't put it back quick enough....I learned that the first day. 

But if you gave this resort 1 star because of this, you are a complete F-ing moron.  If you are not smart enough to call down to guest services to inquire about any charges or when checking out to review your bill then you deserve to get charged for your own stupidity.  I asked about any charges to my room because my company was paying for it and I didn't want any erroneous charges to be put on the company account.  I picked up a few items in the room to read what they were and it showed up, but I told them that I did not use any of them and they immediately removed the charges.  They want you to gamble, they could care less about an in room soda or liquor.  They give that shit away when you are gambling anyways.

All in all this place was great.  I loved it.  I probably will stay closer to all the action of the strip next time, but if you want a place that is a little quieter but still within walking distance, then this is the place for you.",1,0,0

The check in\/check out process was a bit frustrating. Upon check in, the type of room I initially reserved wasn't available; however, for only $20 extra per night, I was able to stay in a premier view room. Check out was easy (at 3am) but the computers were going through daily backup so I wasn't able to receive my folio before I left.

My room on the 29th floor was extremely spacious and comfortable and the view was worth the upcharge. I loved the bathroom -- great vanity, deep tub, and nice shower -- and found the bed to be heavenly. 

The casino is really easy to get around and not that big. The shopping and restaurant areas are also convenient and not terribly confusing to navigate at all. I spent most of my time in the Convention Center, which wasn't a bad walk from the elevators (10 minutes). In addition to eating at Citizens, I also frequented the food court at the Convention Center. These quick, easy, and relatively inexpensive meals, paired with room service and a conveniently-located Starbucks made my down time enjoyable and stress free.

On a side note, room service at Mandalay Bay is fantastic. I ordered my breakfast each night. There's a time span option but I asked for my meal to be delivered at a prompt time - and you'd better believe they stood by it. My 6am breakfast arrived at 6am on the dot. 

In regards to location, Mandalay Bay is the farthest away on the Strip (southern edge) but it's connected to the Luxor by indoor walkway or tram to the Luxor or Excalibur.

For a little under $150\/night for a March trip, and the amount of money I spent on meals and drinks, I'm very happy with my stay at Mandalay and would definitely consider it for a subsequent trip - especially to check out the pool and lazy river, the shopping, and more of the restaurants.",2,0,0

There was a 72 hour special on their website so we booked for 2 nights.  The parking is a bit confusing.  Parking is in the back of the casino.  Check in was pretty fast at 10 pm.  

The Wave Pool and Lazy Pool was pretty cool but not as impressive as I hope to be.  Mandalay have many top notch restaurants here that I will have to try in the future.

What I didn't like was that Resort Fee was mandatory even though you don't use any of their features.  It was only $15 but it shouldn't be mandatory.  The furnitures were a bit outdated and the linens appear old and drabby.  The restroom was decent.  It did have the 2 vanity mirrors, pretty big bath tub, separate toilet room, and shower but it wasn't as impressive as others I've been to.  The only word that would describe it would be ""old.""  Everything was old.

In addition, there was some cleaning guy walking around going into people's room with a spray bottle.  Even with our do not disturb sign, the dude still tried to open the door.  That was pretty creepy.

Another big con for this place is that it was pretty far from the center of the Vegas Strip.  I'm not sure if I'll stay here again.

FYI:  Although they say you can't bring a guest to the Mandalay Beach without them each having their own guest card, you can as long as one person has the guest card.  It depends on who you ask.  Several Mandalay people say you have to be a guest. One of them was nice enough to tell me you didn't have to.  I saved $60 for extra guest cards.",1,1,1

First, restaurant wise, Mandalay bay is packed with so much good food. They have three Michelin star recipient restaurants and although some of them were over-hyped, most are quite delicious. The variety is astonishing for one little hotel \/ casino. The casino area is also very large and has everything from $10 tables and $0.01 slots to $100 tables. If anything, you can always take the tram to the nearby Luxor and Excalibur to find even cheaper tables since its so convenient to do so.

The interior is nice, and the atmosphere is pleasant. They have an awesome pool area \/ Mandalay Beach and THEhotel is posh and overflowing with understated elegance.

Then we come to find out that they charge hotel guests $18 a day for valet parking (something that started recently) and no longer give guests free cold bottled water at the valet desk.  In addition we were told by the valet that Mandalay contracts the valet parking out so if you lose your ticket and you're a hotel guest, they start the $18 a day all over again.

There were some odd things I wouldn't expect in a 4-star resort such as upholstery stains on some of the furniture in the room (is that chocolate?...), a dirty bathtub with hair in it, the previous guest's toiletries in the bathroom, not a single wastebasket in our room, and the general sense of a lack of caring on the part of the staff when we brought these things to their attention.

The novelty of a beach was neat, but the deep end was blocked off since they claimed they didn't have enough lifeguards on hand. Amenities like the cardio room were satisfactory, but to be honest on par with a business hotel.

Room rates vary wildly week by week. To be honest, if we didn't manage to find an excellent rate on Kayak, I doubt we would have stayed here.",2,1,0

The towels are well past their prime and are totally rough and threadbare.

If you want any shade a $100 umbrella rental or $350 Cabana rental are your only options.  Pool towels are nasty and appear that they were purchased used from a local YMCA.

Room- 4 stars.  Nice, clean, comfortable, good view.  Downside, we requested a fridge.. hard to get someone to answer the phone and then they wanted to charge us $35 per night to bring the fridge.  

Workout- 1 Star. We paid an extra resort fee to include our workout.  We then discovered this only includes a cardio room which was busy and included no weights.  They wanted us to pay 25$ extra to visit the weight room located near the spa.  They should tell you this when you make reservations.

Sometimes you just need a vacation where all you plan to do is relax. Visit a spa, read a book, meet up with friends, have another spa treatment, sleep in, shop a little, and not worry about a thing.

Mandalay Bay is the hotel for this! Mandalay has everything under one LARGE roof! You don't have to leave the property and everything you need is there. Celebrity Chef restaurants, sushi, shopping, great entertainment, gambling if you like, & yes... a SPA! 

Check-in
I got the room I reserved near the elevator (the corridors are loooong here!) right away, and early because I was flying in from the East Coast, and was up in my room within an hour. I think, for Vegas, that's great!

Room
I've stayed here before & loved the Great Room Suite because of the jetted spa tub in the bathroom with a flat screen TV! It's a lovely big room with floor to ceiling windows, with a better view than the Bay Suite but I gotta say I don't really like the new layout compared to the old one. You can still see the old one in the virtual tour even though the new configuration is shown in the pictures and floor plan. Why don't I like it? The headboard is against the windows! So you can't lay in bed & look out over either the canyon or strip views! Who thought of that?

SPA - The Good
I had 3 lovely days of 3 different amazing treatments at the @mandalaybay_LV SPA - one of the coolest things is that if you have a spa treatment you can use all the facilities. Adjacent to the  Relaxation Lounge they have a Redwood Sauna, Eucalyptus Steam Room,  Heated Whirlpools (warm & hot) with lovely waterfalls that make the most relaxing sound and a refreshing Cold Plunge. They also have complimentary juices, tea and coffee.

SPA - The Bad
The only thing negative I saw a poorly handled cellphone incident by a teen in the ladies clothing opt. SPA pool area :-(  I guess what happens in Vegas stays on Facebook, Flickr, Twitter, or Snapchat. Sheesh! Keep your phones in the lockers ladies, and I guess your robes on, too! LOL They also supply fruit, muffins, juices, tea and coffee through out the day.

Dining
I really enjoy lunches. Sometimes on vacations I only eat breakfast & lunch. If you sleep in & have a small breakfast (the Cafe to get a latte is right by the elevators) and a good late lunch - who needs a dinner? It's also a great way to try some of the high demand restaurants that are crazy busy for the dinner rush. I'll be submitting reviews for the Four Seasons and Fleur....so I invite you to check those out! 

Shopping
There are lots of shops! I really liked this one that had bath products and I did buy a bath bomb to take back to the jetted tub. Prices also didn't seem super touristy or exorbitant!  

Final Thoughts
All in all, I had a great relaxing stay, got to meet up with some local friends for a few drinks & a pub dinner at Rí Rá Irish Pub, several SPA treatments, and basically just relaxed. Ahhh!",4,3,0

I had no idea what the Media Suite was, however I replied thank you and went on to our room. Wow, what a room! Definitely a once in a lifetime experience, we felt like high rollers.

The mini bar prices were outrageous so we asked to have it locked which the front desk did without any hassle. 

The restaurants were good, big portions of food without a long wait. The pool\/beach area was fantastic but I wish they had more room between the chairs.

Now for the downside of the hotel. There are 8 elevators in two sections, one set for floors up to 16 the second set from 17 and up. Each day we had to wait 5-15 minutes for an elevator!! Not to mention the fact that people crowd the hallway waiting for them so its hard to get on and off.",0,0,0

This time I must say I was a bit disappointed. The day I checked in (June 13th) I was told that I would be required to pay for parking in their newly designed parking garage. I asked where it stated that there was now a charge for parking. She told me that it was in real small writing when making the reservation. Honestly it wasn't the charge for parking it was the point how sneaky Mandalay Bay was about this.

Then I went to the pool on day 2 and asked for 2 towels from the lady at the ""towel counter"". She told me that I was only entitled to 1 towel. I told her that they gave me three towels the day prior.  she proceeded to tell me that they were short on towels (this is my problem why). After going back and forth several times she finally handed me two towels but rolled her eyes and was rude about it. 

Really I paid for my room + resort fee's + parking and they only wanted to give me 1 towel. Give me a break! I am a guest in your hotel and don't expect to be treated this way especially by a 17 year old girl.

2 stars if you want to party. lol.
so 3.5 stars but the Mandalay Beach saves this and makes it a 4

If you want to party on the strip, this hotel is not for you. It's on the edge of the strip and walking anywhere is a pain. There are no clubs in this hotel, just lounges. We drove everywhere.

At first I was bummed to hear we got Mandalay Bay as our hotel through Priceline. I was in Vegas to party for my birthday. But booking last minute on St. Patrick's Day weekend, this place was a Godsend for the cheap price we paid $90 a night + that stupid $25 resort fee.

LOCATION
PROS+++
-At the south end of the strip so easy to get to from the freeway and onto the freeway.
-If you are going anywhere on the strip, there is a back road you can take after exiting the parking structure. I think it's called Frank Sinatra road? It runs along the strip and you never have to sit through traffic. That made me super happy!
-Parking is super easy. TIP! The higher up you go, the more parking spots and you can be close to the elevator. Also you can enter to park from that back road and park on the first floor if you make a right immediately once you enter. It's easy to miss that little pocket of parking spots.
CONS+++
-At the south end of the strip so you'd better take a taxi or have a DD. It will be a pain to walk and the tram doesn't run that late.
-taxi line is a clusterf*** but that's expected at any vegas hotel

ROOM
PRO+++
-Bathroom was amazing with his and her sinks and a stone shower. The bathtub was huge. I could've lived in the bathroom lol.
-The room was clean.
-bed was sooo comfortable
CONS+++
-kind of dated
-we stayed on the 16th floor with a lovely view of the airport :\/ lol

RESORT
PRO+++
-BEACH was awesome! Never had a hard time finding a spot to tan and the Pina Colada was one of the best I've ever had. It was RELAXING. Not somewhere you go to meet someone hot. I was a happy camper relaxing on the sand and enjoying the sun and breeze.
-Older crowd and definitely more family oriented. I enjoyed it and had a nice vacation. I didn't appreciate this until I went over to MGM grand and felt eye violated by everyone
-friendly staff
CON 
-NO LATE NIGHT FOOD OPTIONS! BIG CON. And Raffle Cafe is gross blegh. Thank goodness this place has easy parking and is easy to get in and out of so late night munchies were easy to fix
-$25 resort fee
-Not a party resort and not the best looking crowd (con for some lol)

The A\/C was really cold, when it worked, and there were times, always during the night, where the A\/C would not cool.

I know that food bourne illnesses happen but it is the way it was handled that I am not happy about.  I did file a report and that was it.

Pre-baby trips to Las Vegas changed our viewpoints about where to stay while in town and we often found ourselves staying in T.I (not that that's a bad thing at all) but since we were in town with our little tyke we decided to splurge a bit and stay here for a couple of days after already staying a couple of day prior in another resort at little to no cost. Shhh, I'll fill you in on that in a minute.

From the moment of check-in throughout  our entire stay the services they provided had me very impressed-as I should be right? Sure it's a pain to weave your way through downstair's to pick up your car from valet but that's a miniscule oddity. On the upside they work miracles on expediting.

It would also be sufficient to say that thanks to the many deals Karey R. comes across,  we are able to squeeze our way into hotels we would otherwise never be able to afford. On this particular trip, Karey R. found a good deal from Mandalay Bay, and so, because we just needed to get away and my freaking GMAT hell was finally over, we went.

Our trips have always swayed on the crazy side of things and barely touched on the relaxing side of things, so when we were able to find a place with a fancy pool and tub-tv-filled bathroom, we were ready to try something new. The actual casino has a more relaxed vibe to it than any other casinos in which I've gambled my earnings. There are a few bars and lounges, but nothing that seems to pull the massive groups of alcohol filled partiers. The rooms are standard, but with a no-where near standard huge flat screen tv. Then there's the bathroom: big tub and a little flat screen to pass the time away. Why have I never experienced this before?! Word to the vegas relaxers of the future: go get yourself some bath bombs from the local bath-type store and spend some time in Mandalay Bay's bath tub. Last, and one of the highlights of this trip, are the pools. I spent my time in front of the wave pool and in the lazy river. Their summer hours had them opening and 8 am and you better bet your bottom that we were down there by 8:06 am. You have to plan on doing the same if you want a spot on a lounge chair. Because of our on-timeness, we scored the front row lounge chairs by the wave pool on the sand. Karey and Cecilia were brave enough to put down the cash for some inner tubes, and so I did experience the lazy river, which should be renamed to the ""lazy river until you get to the two high powered waterfalls which take a lot of effort to avoid.""

They've designed the pool area to look like a beach, they have a lazy river [inner tubes could be rented for an arm and a leg], and they have nice areas for you to sunbathe. The cardio center really came in handy my most recent stay at the Mandalay Bay because I paid for the buffet of buffets deal that Harrah's has going on. I hopped on the exercise bike and\/or treadmill in between every meal to hedge against the damage.

The Mandalay Bay has one of the best sportsbooks in Las Vegas. The fact that they have The Lion King playing there definitely brings in a lot of guests. There are a number of nice restaurants opened up by celebrity chefs like Hubert Keller, Susan Fenniger, Rick Moonen, and Wolfgang Puck.

Items were stolen from our room, the hotel switched out room. The front desk proceeded to tell us it was our fault for leaving our door open but wouldn't show records of the lock transactions from the time we had left to the time we returned to our room to find our keys wouldn't open our door and minutes later we watched a man exit our room with our belongings. The new room we were moved to burnt out light bulbs so we were not able to see into our room, the front desk said we will fix it tomorrow (this was at 1am), 10 minutes we turned on our bathroom sink and the entire sink fell apart and water went all over. We had the Maintenance man in our room till past 1am fixing these issues.
The hotel did not make this situation right. We were told this doesn't happen very often but it happens and they did NOTHING to compensate for the massive safety violation and inconveniences of this happening. Will not stay here again.",0,0,0

Fun hotel, unique amenities, lots to do....but be prepared to pay through the nose for EVERYTHING. If you want to sit in the shade by the pool, it's $75 per chair plus another $100 for an umbrella...otherwise you can expect to fry. If you want to relax on the lazy river, you must use an inner tube   --  which has to be rented. If you want a cabana...it's over $300. Also, be prepared to double check your bill and don't rely on the hotel to take care of you. For example, we bought  show tickets (Cirque de Soleil-love) for over $100 each through the Mandalay's concierge. Imagine our surprise when we sat down in the theater to find a pole right in front of us. They were ""limited view"" seats and we were not told! (The show was great by the way...just not the seats). Also, on the morning of our check out day we received a knock on our room door by the cleaners at 9:00 AM. I told them that we would be checking out so they should come back later. The house cleaning staff then asked me ""when"" I would be leaving. I told them that we would be leaving at 11 which is the check out time. Her face fell and she was clearly disappointed. Five minutes later they knocked on the door of our adjacent room, but before we had a chance to answer the door they barged in and walked straight in the room while my husband was changing. I guess they were in a hurry for us to leave!
It's not a terrible hotel...most of the staff were friendly and the rooms were clean enough....but expect to pay a lot more if you want to enjoy the hotel's offerings.... even if you get a good room rate.  Personally, I was a little insulted by all of the extra fees and I would not stay there again. Even a huge wave pool doesn't justify the fees.",0,0,0

We went to a concert in their club downstairs where Metro Boomin was performing. Paid $35 for tickets. I got rather drunk but was minding my own business when they kicked me out of the club. I snuck back in a few times just to get kicked out again and escorted out of the hotel. I snuck back into the hotel to go back to my room. I was sleeping in my bed when security barged in and started yanking me out of my bed. I was passed out sleeping when they did so. I started yelling asking them to stop touching me and they would not. SECURITY not cops handcuffed me and made me walk in a 90 degree angle all the way to the elevator where they slammed my head against the wall. My hips are bruised along with other minor injuries from the ridiculous handling of this hotel. They tried to have me arrested but failed to due so as I was not causing anyone any harm. I ended up staying at another hotel that night. I cannot believe the manner in which this hotel thinks is okay to treat its guests. I understand when someone is too intoxicated having to save your own ass and keep them from causing problems. but they PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED me when I was not causing any harm to anyone.

She didn't mind our room as much as she minded the location of the Hotel (with regard to it's proximity to anything else). This place is just too damn far from anything cool (even the Vegas Monorail).

I didn't think our room was worth the money we paid either, the room was at the very end of the hall completely opposite the elevator, so it took AGES to get to the door, especially when we were trashed. On top of that the furniture was beat up and the curtains were stuck part way open.

The beach is awesome, the lazy river wasn't exactly lazy (what with all the kids and pool toys), the wave pool was nice and warm, but the life guards are overbearing (""Get behind the blue line!!!"" Ugh! Shutup!), and I got sick from the fried chicken at the To-Go Grill. The Shark-Reef is pretty great, which is a significant compliment, especially since I've been to the Monterey Bay Aquarium and Academy of Sciences.

Most of our time was spent walking away from here because there wasn't any other entertainment at our hotel while we were there, which is stupid considering they have a giant convention center complex attached. The Mandalay Place shops are pretty weak too.

If you stay here, check out the Reef, Minus5 bar, and the beach. They are all pretty cool. Bring extra money for cabs, this place is at the VERY END of the strip; or if you have an aversion to cabs bring comfy shoes, take the free tram to Excalibur, then walk across Tropicana Ave. to New York New York, then across LV Blvd. to MGM Grand and then take the Monorail ($5 a passenger). 

I will mention, my wife got sick on the carpet and they didn't charge us to clean up. That was cool and probably their saving grace.",0,0,1

About 6 weeks ago, my friend and I visited the hotel.  We got to the hotel at around 330am, dropped off the car with valet and checked in.  When we woke up and went to valet to get the car, we waited nearly 30minutes until the valet manager asked us to come with him because there was a situation with the car.  To our shock, the car was broken into and vandalized.  There were broken items in my car (valued at $2K) and lost of $50 in cash.  When I told them I had about $50 in cash, they (hotel security) pretty much just scuffled at me making me feel foolish for mentioning that I was missing $50. 

I've never experienced this before, so I relied on the directions of security and the valet manager.  They suggested I fill out an incident report and to go and get an estimate.  We spent our Saturday going to the dealership, to get our estimate (about $2K worth of damage) and submitted it to hotel security and asked them to include it in our incident report file.  Mind you, the hotel did not give me a copy of the incident report nor did they give me an incident report number.  Luckily, I took a picture of the report myself so that I can reference it.  Since it was a Saturday, they told me that I will be contacted by Racquel with RISK MANAGEMENT on Tuesday \/ Wednesday.  

I did not get a call from RISK MANAGEMENT as I was told I would get, so, I followed up with RISK MANAGEMENT on Thursday and she said she had not had a chance to review the security video and had a few days off since it was during the holidays.  She requested I call Metro to get information on the incident knowing that metro cannot provide me with any information since a direct police report from was not filed.  So, I called her back on a weekly basis and she kept on telling me to contact everyone else but risk management.  She kept on giving me the run around to call security, metro, anyone to get me off of her back.  

To this day I do not know where I stand with Mandalay and am very disappointed as to how they have handled this situation.  They ruined my vacation as I had to spend the day on Saturday getting an estimate for their mishap.  I got zero compensation from this situation besides agony and stress.  I expect a lot more from this establishment as my friend and I are frequent visitors of the Mandalay Hotel.  

After this terrible experience, I will never stay at this hotel again.  They keep your car keys, windows rolled down, and car near the garage entrance \/ exit which makes your valuable property vulnerable for any criminal to access.  I wished I had known this before dropping the car off.",5,0,0

Anyhoo, the rooms themselves are starting to feel bypassed by all the bigger-and-better that's opened over the last 15 years. They're still fairly spacious and our room in July 2014 was well-kept (carpet\/linens in good repair and no chips on the furniture), but those once-vaunted bathrooms feel plain now (and the showers small) next to Mandarin Oriental\/Cosmopolitan\/Aria\/Encore\/Palazzo and the like and the room decor that was put in a few years ago is feeling pretty plain.

All that aside, this place is all about the public areas if any resort ever was. They've recently spiffed up the casino carpet with an elegant deep blue\/maroon\/beige design that replaces the dated-looking tropical flower design it used to have. And the chandeliers in the casino are still very cool and the layout is far less maze-like than most. It's very easy to navigate. The drinks at the tables aren't watered-down and the cocktail service is more frequent than at many other large properties. 

Of course, the mega-pool is a huge draw for many. It's always crowded and it's hard to find lounges sometimes, but the different environments are still pretty special. There's the sandy beach with the wave pool, plus a few other smaller pools spread around. Generally, you can find a spot to park even though it may be a bit of a hunt. There's also the Moorea ""European"" pool area (""Toptional!"" say the posters advertising it throughout the property.) There's also a casino and a beach bar\/grill added within the past few years.

My favorite here is the restaurant collection. Just about every conceivable food genre has been covered and many of the restaurants have been here since day one, which says they're doing something right. Decor is important and ranges from the dark ice bar at Red Square to the cool modernism of Aureole to the trickling stream of Shanghai Lily to the awesome lattice woodwork of StripSteak. Of particular note for a casual meal is Burger Bar in the Mandalay Place shopping arcade, which should be a mandatory stop. For something higher in price and altitude, don't miss miX atop the adjoing THEHotel (soon to be Delano) tower. It has the absolute best lounge view in all of Vegas (forget GhostBar). And guys, you can drain the lizard while overlooking the pool area from the window-side urinals. And this summer at least, the lounge gave out free glasses of champagne at sunset. Just about every restaurant in the place has either an early or a late happy hour special, so you can spend from 3pm to midnight crawling from happy hour to happy hour (I've done it, so I know it's possible). 

The spa isn't as much of a wow as many of the other newer ones, but the plunge pool area does have a cool jungle decor. 

Service-wise, it's never been especially polished, but I've never had a real issue in all my visits either. To me, this is a reliable, all-around property that at least succeeds in all the Vegas elements and excels in some.",2,2,0

Yes, you can hear the air traffic from the rooms. The hotel is about a $10+ cab ride to other hotels & entertainment spots on the Vegas strip. Women if you covet your feet, don't try to walk the really lengthy strip blocks, especially in heals. You'll get enough exercise through shopping and dancing later.

Rooms in general were spacious with large sized bathrooms, good for two people sharing. Cleanliness was alright.  I would give Mandalay Bay an overall three rating, nothing over the top where quality customer service was concerned. The staff didn't provide excellent customer service but fair to say, around average. They receive a three for hospitality and for overall enjoyable hotel experience.

Mandalay Bay is popular with business travellers and the twenty to forty something clientele. The casino is really nothing spectacular and cannot be compared to other more opulent ones on the strip; like the Bellagio, Cosmopolitan, or Wynn & Encore Resort.  It hosts a couple of nice lounges, Mix, Eyecandy, Red Square Bar, and House of Blues. 

What the hotel management doesn't offer to tell their guests is House of Blues Foundation is private and only open to Vegas residents. Would have been nice to check out the site and view from atop the strip as the hotel advertises on their website.

Pool which is touted as one of the hotel's highlights was closed for cleaning during our stay, a huge disappointment. Had we known in advance while booking, we would have opted to stay at another hotel. Many amazing hotels to choose from in Vegas.

There are plenty of really good restaurants to dine at in Vegas, you can choose from an array of fine dining establishments. Having said that I didn't get to try Charlie Palmer's Steak Lounge at Mandalay.  Somehow, I envision lounging over drinks, not steaks as advertised by the hotel! 

If you're a business traveller, Mandalay hosts the convention centers, you might want to opt to stay for that specific reason. As for leisure travel, I would prefer to check out what the rest of Vegas has to offer in way of hotels.  If you want an average hotel experience with $$$$ room rates, Mandalay Bay would be the place to stay.

One star: we asked for two rooms both with two beds and instead got 2 rooms with two kings. After yelling at the manager did they change one of them to two queens. They said they had more but on group was too lazy to move and we're fine with it. 
So while there were plenty of 2 bed rooms, and the reservation was made for a 2 bed room, only the manager was able to give us a two bed room. 

One star: we needed a fridge for some stuff and they had to be asked 3 times for a fridge. On the third time they brought it to the correct room. Trust me, we were enunciating.

The rooms are rather nice and spacious. The beds are great and the bathroom could house 2 more people if you really need it. 

This review is written in the winter, but I hear the pool and spa are to die for.

2 stars: customer service is constantly an issue. You try to give them some information and instead of listening they ask you point blank ""why are you telling me this?"" Which is either preceeded or followed by the question asking for the information. Tell them your name and what you reserved they mutter under their breath why are you telling me.... of wait, what did you reserve again?

The beach \/ pool \/ river area was mostly closed for construction. I would like to come back in the summer and see how this place compares to the excellent pool area at the Mirage. 

I didn't  care for the room. It had so many doors it made for an awkward layout . Double doors for the two closets, the bathroom, toilet and shower. They all opened up against a bed or wall or something equally  unmovable, restricting getting around if any door was open. Most doors had wood slats for the pseudo - cabana look. The towels had the consistency of sandpaper. The other room our group had seemed a bit more normal  and functional.

The hotel is a Little bit off the strip and maybe that helps, that it is quick and easy to catch a cab, even on the weekends. The line was fairly short and moved quickly.

The casino was friendly to half our group. Jeff won a $1,500 slots jackpot after swearing how stingy the Mandalay's machines were and  Robert made a few hundred every time he stepped out of the room.

The casino has a few theme attractions, one for Russian food, which I can't understand and one for 70;s disco. They also have live music in the casino bar.

On Thursday we had to swim a sea of trailer park hookers to get to the elevators to our room. They congregated at the slots near the elevator and threw themselves at any man going by. On Friday Security was out in force and the area  was clear.",0,0,0

This hotel is perfect for guests who don't care to be near the ""chaos"" in the center of the strip, as this hotel is on the south end of the strip (close the airport).  There is a monorail that runs thru Luxor and Excalibur, so getting to the center of the strip is not difficult, albeit a longer walk.

The rooms are clean, bright, and fairly large.  The bathrooms also have a glass shower\/separate tub and large double vanity, so there's plenty of room for 2 ppl.

Mandalay's casino is also pretty large, so there's no need to venture to other casinos for gambling.  There are also lots of dining options to satisfy all palettes.  A favorite thing is that this place always seems to smell like coconuts and sun block, which reminds me of vacation.  Despite the # of smokers, the ventiliation here is great so you don't leave smelling like an ash tray.  Also check out the spa if you have time - it was fab!!!

You can really get your money's worth during the winter months.  Staff and service were friendly and helpful.  I did not think this level of service existed in Las Vegas anymore.  Big props to management for ensuring this level of service is consistently experienced at every turn throughout such a large resort.  


Check-in\/out: (grade: A)  Minimal waiting, friendly and accomodating staff, great lobby ambiance.  What more can you ask for?  Unless you are coming at a peak time, or a completely unreasonable guest, I can't imagine one having negative experience.

Room (grade: A-)   Overall very consistent with a 3.5\/4 start hotel room.  I was placed in a 28th floor room with a pool view.  I found it to be nicely appointed overal.  It was clean, had no funny smells,  or stains.  I think the TV in the bathroom sticks out like a sore thumb, and in this day of age, is not so much of a novelty anymore.  I wish the provided tollietries were a bit more high end, and I would have otherwise  given an A grade for the room.  If you are a light sleeper, you will be able to hear the jets taking off in the mornings.  You are probably fine if you ask for a room away from the airport.
Be aware there is a resort fee.  My guess is they have to have it to normalize their hotel margins with all those casino room comps and resort credits being offered to Mlife players.  But at least they did a great job of being up front about it.  I was probably notified it three times during the booking process, twice more at check-in.   I can't imagine anyone getting all their money's worth out of the items and services offered through the resort fee.  I partook of only the wifi, and the connection speed was acceptable.  

Food:  (grade: B+)  At the Bayside Buffet, the food was a dissapointment.  Service was great though, and we did not have to wait too long in line.  Weekend pricing was in effect.  Seafood was second tier.   Considering the regular the weekday price, the food quality is on par.   But if Mandalay needs to charge more during the weekends, there has to be more value provided to the guest.  I would have been very dissapointed if I did not have a food and beverage credit as part of my stay to offset the price.  Set your expectations higher than Sizzler, and Golden Corral, but lower than Wynn or Wicked Spoon buffets.

Noodle Company salvaged the food grade for my stay.  Great food here.  A bit pricey though.  I think they were a little understaffed so the service was a little slow.  But an overall great experience at the Noodle Company.  

The place is huge.  Many other things to experience at the resort.  Yes the big pool is closed during the winter.  I want to come back and experience Shark Reef and perhaps the nightlife options.",1,0,0

We just knew we were going to wait until 3pm to check in, since we arrived at 11 a.m., so in this sense we were prepared, but Mandalay made sure we were settled in by 11:15!

We ate at the buffet (not my first choice anywhere), and again were pleasantly surprised from the decor of the hotel, to the choice of food selection, not your everyday buffet.

I paid $14 to get wifi in our room and when I booked cirque du soleil tickets online, I had to print off the voucher. If the lady hadn't let me do it for free (which was probably good for her safety--as I was getting angry at the ridiculous prices of things) it seriously would have cost me $21 to print 3 pages ($15 to access the net on their computer and then another $2 a page). 

The pools were great, but of course, they were packed. If you didn't get out there as soon as they opened, you were hard pressed to find anywhere to sit. But we usually found lounge chairs within the first few minutes of walking around. You just had to claim lounges musical chairs style. By the third day we had moved on from the wave pool and lazy river area to the regular pools because they were less over-run with kids and you can bring drinks into the regular pools but not into the wave pool or lazy river. The lazy river isn't very lazy anyways, there are kids screaming and splashing and two waterfalls that are so strong you come back up in fighting mode. If you do plan on going in though, bring your own tube (lots of people do) because it costs $20 a day to rent one. 

We had a normal room, and it was really nice. The bed was sooo comfortable thanks to some sort of fluffy feather pad on top of the mattress and there was a big plasma TV on the wall. There are floor to ceiling windows that you can see out, but no one can see in, which is nice for...well, whatever you want to do in your room. The bathroom has a separate toilet room, glass shower, big soaking tub, and a small flat screen TV facing the tub. 

Overall, I think this place is great. The location sucks a little, being at the end of the strip, but there is a tram from the hotel to the Exalibur and you can cross the street to MGM Grande tram which goes down the strip a ways (although be warned: they make you walk through every square inch of the casino\/hotel to get to the tram entrance and now it costs $5 to ride).

I wish there was a drape that would cover the peep-hole.

I definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.

Regardless, being a Four Seasons Hotel should say enough in that this hotel is all about high class and luxury.   The rooms are spacious and filled with all the high quality amenities you would expect from a hotel of this caliber but for me, that's not the best part.  

Mandalay Bay has a whole host of clubs and bar areas with a variety of live music. On any given night, there are many (3 or 4) different live music venues within the hotel and don't forget about House of Blues as well.  When I want to hang out, have a few drinks and relax in a safe, upscale environment (without hundreds of 20 somethings jumping around to techno music), Mandalay Bay becomes my sanctuary.

On the morning of our checkout around 7-8 am while we were all sleeping, my friend woke up to a man standing in our room. He ran out the door when he realized she was awake and she followed him and saw that he used a towel to keep the door open so it would not make any noise. She told us after what had happened, but we were all confused and thought it was a mistake by one of the employees of Mandalay bay. As we were packing we realized that my boyfriends iPhone and money from my friends purse was missing and searched the whole room and found nothing. That is when we knew for sure that the man my friend saw came in here to steal from us because clothes were moved around and there is no other explanation we could think of. We had the two keys to the room the hotel provided for us so we know that we didn't accidentally drop one of our keys, which means it had to be an employee that had access to keys and the shirt he was wearing was worn by other employees we saw walking around. We reported the incident immediately and the hotel made us fill out a form writing down everything that happened and told us it would take 7-10 business days to investigate till they would get back to us. They also said that they could do nothing else for us even though we feel like our safety and privacy was broken. It has been over 3 weeks now and I called asking for an update which they passed me around to a bunch of numbers. The last number they transferred me to, they gave me a number in case it got disconnected. There was a problem so I called the number back that they gave me to which Verizon told me this number is not a working number..     If they looked at the security cameras in the hall way they could clearly see a man walking into our room and using a key, but I doubt they even investigated this incident. 

I do not care about the stolen items at this point, but I do care about the fact that they did not take us seriously or do a little more for us because having a man enter your hotel room without your consent while you are sleeping is not something you would expect from a hotel like this and no longer feel safe to ever stay at this hotel again.",7,1,1

This is probably just fine if you know the layout of the property and parking garage and don't have a problem with self-park ($10\/day). If not or if you're a bit weary after a day of travel it might be a major pain. Either way, from the moment we turned into the Mandalay Bay entrance off the strip it took us an hour to get to the lobby. Not cool after a long drive and day of work. We also tried to expedite our check-in by using the mobile scan check-in option...but it didn't work.  We ended up having to wait in line.  Same deal when we checked out.  Mobile check-out kept bringing up an error so we had to deal with a Sunday late-morning check-out line.  

Once we actually made it up to our room we were impressed with the desk set-up (great for a morning of work), high floor, and the general ambiance of the room.  After unpacking we made our way down for a late dinner and found that our only option for a decent sit-down dinner and drink was the new Libertine Social space.  This did the (expensive) trick (shared salad + pretzel + two drinks for $57 + tip).  Played some poker for a couple hours and then decided to call it an ""early"" night and enjoy a shower and decent night of rest after a long day. This is really, really hard to do when the water in your room is shut off.  We tested toilet, sinks, and shower.  Nada.  We called down, connected after about 7-8 minutes and our options were:  1)  you can have the water in the mini-bar complimentary or 2) you can change rooms.  Given the options we opted for #2.  We were *not* happy about packing everything up and changing rooms at 2:15am after such a long day.  They comped our resort fee but the whole ordeal left us annoyed.  By the time we settled in our new room (21 floors below) with a parking lot view it was after 3:00.  F-that.  

TL;DR  Rooms nice enough but everything else went wrong and\/or too expensive.

Lizzie at check in made the process better than could have been hoped for. Two queen beds were perfect for our family of four. The view of the strip was unbeatable. Unfortunately, we lost power to most of the bathroom one night and didn't get it back in time for us to finish preparing for our one big night out. We had to improvise but we got it done. We didn't have any issues with hearing our neighbors and we were surrounded by other families. 

The kids would have lived in the pools except they ended up with a weird rash; I'm assuming the result of chemicals considering this has not happened to my water babies before. The service at the pool was also less than optimal with long waits between visits. 

The restaurants at the Mandalay Bay could have been all we visited because the selection was so great. But we had a great time checking out places at the Luxor and New York, New York each of which were so easy to get to with the free tram. 

We wrapped up the trip at Shark Reef - a perfect ending to a great getaway. 

Tips:
- View room was totally worth it. 
- Get to the pool within an hour of opening (it was 8 for us). Chairs go fast and the cabanas are ridiculously priced. Shade, however, is pretty non existent. There can be a little found around the lazy river. Those are the least popular as well. And the servers seem to know because they hardly come by. 
- Be prepared for a line at check in. It moves fast but can be surprising when you first see it. We got there at 3:30 on a Saturday and the line was nearly past the ropes. We were at the front in about 20 mins. 
- Careful about how you get charged online. Apparently, kids should not be an extra person charge. 
- The free tram is AWSOME. Had no problem getting to everywhere we wanted to go. We only needed one taxi ride for when we went downtown. Everything else we wanted was accessible with the tram and a short walk.",0,0,0

My wife and I decided to stay at the Mandalay bay hotel for the Rock and Roll Marathon in which my wife was running in. We had heard alot of great things about this place, its a shame none of it was true.
Let's start off with Check in. We go there at around noon and were told that our room wasn't currently ready, that was fine i understood that part. They gave us some keys and told us they would call us to let us know the room number in an hour. Which never happened. We finally just went back up to the front desk and asked and sure enough they had our room ready they had just neglected to call us to let us know. So they gave us a room number wrote it down and everything. The Room number was located in their new all suite "" the Hotel""  we got to the room and our keys didd't work and the maid was still there cleaning. Getting to the Hotel was quite the walk since we didn't know exactly where it was. I decided to call to make sure they gave us the correct room number which they hadn't, it was actually a room back in Mandalay Bay part of the hotel. GREAT! now we get to make the hike back to the other hotel. They told us that because of the problem that was their fault they would give us a 50.00 credit to use on room service or food in one of the resturants. I guess i should have looked at the menu because 50.00 could maybe get my wife and i 1 entree, 1 drink and 1 desert. Its pretty expensive.
Other parts of the hotel , our sheets had stains on them and they were pretty cheap linen. maybe 60 count sheets , it was like sandpaper along with the bath towels. They were very good for exfoliating. The walls were quite thin we could hear the people that were loacated on either side of us talking. Best of all my wife wanted to grab a shower after her run but she couldnt cause the water pressure and heat didn't work. It was very cold in Las vegas for the run in the 30's and 40's with wind and rain , yea!!!
When we left today we made sure to check our bill and were suprised to see that they hadnt given us the 50.00 credit so we had to fight them about that on the way out.

My first time here we had a pool view on a high floor and everything was perfect. My recent visit, not so much.

I requested a room far from the elevator and was told that the one we had was the only one currently ready. We had a long drive and wanted to sleep, so didn't want to wait for another room. I didn't know it would be the first room after the elevator. I don't mind the loud people walking down the hall, it's a given in Vegas, but the room next to us had loud children that were slamming the door all day and the room on the other side was a service room that was constantly being slammed. I kept waking up from my sleep thinking someone was trying to get into our room and didn't feel like I was in a nice end hotel, but a cheapy ass motel.

The plumbing in the other rooms can also be heard through this one. When someone was bathing next door it sounded like a waterfall and like it was in our own room and was extremely loud for the morning. We also had plumbing issues with our left sink and it didn't run any cold water, just dripped when we turned it in. We ended up just using that to store our drink with ice. The mini bar was broken shut, so we couldn't get that open and the coffee machine didn't drip hot beverage, just cold coffee. Thankfully I brought my own k-cups and didn't waste the $4 for their coffee, or else I would have been deeply disappointed.

The view was pretty crappy as well. We got a mountain view, which was nice and all but because we were a corner room half the window was a wall instead. We ordered to have to robes and slippers sent up, so we can relax and they forgot the slippers. I didn't want to deal with calling again for them, so I let it go. The TV kept freezing in the middle of shows and movies and that was annoying.

We got no sleep because of all the surrounding noise, so in the morning i called the front desk and explained everything that happened and asked to at least be given an addition hour to check out and they were not helpful at all. I understand it's their policy, but on a Sunday and when you gave us such a POS room I would think as a courtesy they would extend an hour for us.

So every day, I had to spend at least 30 minutes waiting, to simply access my room. The hotel promised they would ""send engineers"" to fix my room, but that obviously didn't work. 

Moreover, the TV did not work. And, when attending a casino area serving food & drinks, it took approximately 35 minutes to get my first drink. It took over 40 minutes to simply get a menu.

What a disappointment, we were celebrating a Birthday weekend and.... Oh well. 

Hotel: Beautiful, lush, tropical, marble, fountains, lovely. Well maintained.


Room: We stayed on the 32nd floor with a pool view (airport and parking lot view as well). As other reviewers have disclosed the rooms show signs of wear and the walls are thin. We heard the people in the room next-door, their phone ringing and their television. In the evening we heard thumping from music in the clubs. Airplane traffic was persistent and combined with helicopter noise, annoying! 

Casino: No matter what you like to play... you can find it here! The overall feeling in the casino was buoyant, even-though we did not witness much winning. It's obvious that the staff on the casino floor are few and the employees working are doing so much! At one point I sat for over Twenty minutes at a machine with its lights flashing and buzzer sounding. A gentleman that was cleaning (Jesus) found someone to help me. The attendant (Luz) was apologetic and remedied the situation. The beverage servers were amazing, one in particular (Wyonna) was spectacular! 

Pools\/Beach\/Cabana: We rented cabana number Five. When we first arrived, I picked up trash that was left behind by the last occupants. We rented the cabana thinking we would have some semblance of privacy. Privacy = Nonexistent, in fact someone walked right through it while we were on our lounge chairs! (It was so windy we had to leave the curtains open). In front of the cabana there is not a clear division of space, with the exception of cabanas having red lounge chairs. We had people right next (and I mean RIGHT NEXT) to our ""red"" chairs, smoking, sun bathing, partying and having a great time. The food and beverage servers were terrific, yet another hard working group of employees. The lifeguards were friendly and observant. The pool and beach areas were clean and inviting. Restrooms in the pool area could be improved upon. 

Dining: There are scores of dining options most were fairly pricey and nothing we had is worth mentioning. 

Service: The Staff at Mandalay Bay = STELLAR! Every employee that we encountered was friendly, helpful and efficient (Michael at the VIP Card service desk was simply wonderful).The employees' make this hotel extraordinary and would be the reason we return...If we visit Mandalay Bay again, we will book a suite as far away from the airport as possible.

Here is what I love about Mandalay:  the spacious layout of the resort with House of Blues, Foundation Room, great restaurants, the arena and not having to drive too far in to the main part of the Strip where the cars get jammed up and it can take 5 min to get a couple blocks. 

Here is what I don't like:   paying for parking.   Been in Vegas for 20 years and prior to a couple years ago we did not pay for parking so that kinda rubs me the wrong way every time I go. Plus paying (the actual payment) for the parking is a little confusing.

Restaurants: 5\/5 (but pricey)

So the rooms are actually quite nice, and can be quite relaxing - unless you're staying with a bunch of guys for a bachelor party like I did this weekend. However I stayed before alone (for a conference) and it was really nice.

I had some issues with the front desk both times - it seems like they hire people who are untrained, unexperienced in customer service, and I'm assuming low paid.

I complained about this and the hotel was extremely slow to respond. The first time this past January, they basically said they were sorry and that was the end of it. 

So when I went this time I asked if they'd make amends another way. I asked them the Friday I came out - they didn't get me a full response until the coming Tuesday, so I missed out on any opportunity to capitalize on their offer while there.

They offered me a discount on a future stay, I had requested passes for one of their clubs as amends. I think that's a half assed response, personally. I don't care for a 10% discount or whatever the discount is, give me something of value. Club comps are not a huge deal in my opinion. 

The restaurants are good though, good options. The pool is also great. But I have to say, it seems like NO ONE is happy to work in Vegas, it seems like no one likes being there. I have this theory that Vegas is an incredibly unhappy place, and I think it's probably true due to the absurdly shallow nature of the place. Also the fact that everyone's on the hustle. Vegas is sort of like a human circus in my opinion.

But Mandalay Bay is a bit of a respite from that, it's got some luxury, and it's relatively quiet. 

I stopped by the pool party this past Friday for it's debut and it's pretty solid.

I'd give the hotel 4 stars if it weren't for the terrible service. It's a shame because it's quite nice, the restaurants, the pool, all that.  But the people really matter and this is something Vegas just doesn't get right, and I think it has to do with the fact the Vegas is rotten at it's core. But don't get me wrong, I love the pool parties...",4,4,2

The room was large and the bathroom had a large soaking tub with a television in the mirror. We didn't get a great view (the back side of the Luxor\/freeway) but we didn't get a ""strip view"" room so I didn't expect much. They put a random $200 charge on our debit card, so beware of that.

And it might have been 5 years ago, maybe not so much today.  Certainly not a bad hotel, but I expected more from one of the mega hotels.

On the plus side, the resort as a whole presents well on the surface.  They have several pools and a wave pool with a sandy beach, although the beach-side casino that was to open at 11 had still not opened by 11:15.  Their loss in this case.  There's an aquarium which is pretty cool, but that and the beach make Mandalay Bay more ""family friendly"" than I would prefer.  

Although the resort is on the far end of the strip, there's a tram that runs to Luxor and Excalibur, and it's not far from there to pick up another that runs all the way to Bellagio.  These are free, but they don't run all night, so expect to take a cab if you don't feel like walking through a sea of arms offering you ""trading cards.""  I highly recommend this experience if you have children, however, and are looking to provide them with the complete Las Vegas experience. 

As for the hotel itself, the rooms are spacious, and our strip-view room actually looked down the strip, rather than across the street.  They could use some updating though.  The tub was dingy, and so was the tile of the shower floor.  There's an odd window in the bath that faces the entry to the room.  A nice peep show for room service I guess, except in my case, it would be more like a horror show.  There were double sinks, but only one was usable thanks to the disgusting gurgling and subsequent back-up we experienced on a daily\/nightly basis when it wasn't even being used!  Room service was the bright spot of the hotel.  Delivery was prompt and complete, and the server was very courteous.

At check-out, I was charged for a $30 bottle of vodka and a $30 spa tip in error.  While I may have tripped the sensor in the mini-bar, I'm pretty sure I was sober enough to remember I did not drink it.  After undergoing the interrogation about that, I was subjected to further interrogation about the spa tip.  Since I never went to the spa, I'm pretty certain I didn't tip anyone there.  And wouldn't it be odd that only the tip, and not the service, would be charged to the room?

The odd is my dog is a well trained and well behaved service dog, and I have stayed in many hotels with my dog from time to time and I have never encountered things like this.

Over the phone, when I was trying to explain to them and ask for evidence (i.e. pictures), they HANGED UP my phone call. I called again and asked the speak to manager, she couldn't provide evidence and simply asked me to appeal with my credit card company. 

This hotel is really tricky and it may come up with lots of weird charges. For example, I didn't drink the fireball in the fridge, (I don't drink alcohol), they were trying to charge me for the drink. Then I told them I didn't drink it, they removed the charge right away....

That mattress was surprisingly nice. i believe it even had a featherbed topper, which I adore. Pillows were nice as well! The standard room is not huge, but it works.

The bad:

You can hear everything in the hallways. They have the cheapest doors possible because I heard many a conversation seemingly right outside the door while I was trying to sleep.

Expensive: i get it, its vegas, its a hotel on the strip. I get that and I've stayed at other hotels and they don't charge such ridiculous prices. This applies to room service as well as the stores and restaurants inside. Insanely overpriced food in restaurants and NOT delicious. If it was pricey but good, that's fine. But it wasn't. Citizen sucked. The turkey and avocado for 19? Super bleh!

Poor housekeeping: first day, called housekeeping to request for a fridge, they charge 35$. I said ok i'll do one night... the fridge never came so oh well thats fine i'll just get ice from the vending machine to keep my kids' milk chilled. Upon checkout they charged us for the fridge for all 4 nights we were there. Another thing, so we used the water glasses so my kids can drink milk. Housekeeping came by next day to tidy up the room. I was expecting them to replace the glasses with clean ones. What I found was no doubt the same glass which the lady just wiped down. I can tell because the glass looked like someone just rinsed it once and wiped it with a towel. When i smelled it, yup smelled like milk. Housekeeping does not change the glassware with new ones.

Oh also room service does not take the trolleys or trays left out in the hallways for HOURS! We'd go pass by trolleys and trays in the hallway at say 2pm and when we get back at 8, they were still there.

We got one room with double beds, we had a view of the pool. Our bathroom had a bathtub, two sinks, standup shower- it was so nice!

**NO BED BUGS**

The price for the hotel wasn't a bad price, we paid $550 for 2 nights and then off course the $36.00 a night resort fee, and then $10.00 for parking. Good thing about parking is you can park at any of the other hotels that fall under Mlife. I think they should do away with parking for the hotel guests.( just a suggestion)

We went to the pool and was able to find seating with no problem. Drink and food service was a bit slow- oh and don't ask for water they won't bring it, I think the servers think they might not get a tip if theironly bringing water.
HINT: We were able to bring in our adult sippy cups :) 

They have a tidal wave pool, with real sand by the seating area. The only thing I didn't like was they had a pool line that they made everyone who was in the wave pool stay behind, you weren't able to sit in the water at the edge.

A few hours later I woke up to multiple hotel security personnel INSIDE MY ROOM slamming a flashlight on the mirror by the door.  They were demanding to see my ID.  They were extremely rude and had no empathy whatsoever.  They took my wallet and grabbed my ID from it while I was in bed wondering why all this was happening.  They said the room was listed as not having anyone in it, so obviously I was breaking in...  After what seemed like a 15 minute conversation between the security guards and their bosses on the other side of the radio, they forced me to pack up my stuff to move to another room.

I can normally keep calm, and it's very rare that I get mad, but I completely lost it at this point.  They didn't even tell the people on the radio that I was trying to sleep.  They didn't even attempt to see if I could change rooms when I was done sleeping.  It had to be right that second.  They just kept saying there is an ""engineering issue"" with the room and I had to leave immediately.  It was like they were expecting the room to blow up.  So I got out of bed, packed my things, and then security escorted me to the room the front desk should have put me in from the start.  They didn't even get me a working key card for the room.

So what was the issue with the room you ask?  The front desk said the room wasn't clean, but it was 100% spotless.

They comp'ed my resort fees and gave me a meal credit for the troubles, but it was nowhere near enough to give me a positive opinion of the resort.

We typically stay at Harrah's properties, mainly because of the perks, (free rooms, free play and other comps). But, we got comped for a couple nights here, with free play and considerable resort credit. (I guess it pays to play and lose, lol).

Our first impression was with the valet and it was suspect from the start. We pull up, valet asks for our room number and we tell him we don't have one cuz we are just checking in. So he asks for our reservation, we show him our confirmation and he says, ""I don't have any record of your reservation"". Now that's only a problem because often times, they will not valet you unless you have a reservation. But, in his defense, he saw our bags and realized we wouldn't be carrying all that $hit around with us unless we WERE checking in... So he gave us our ticket and we were off to the races.

The line to check in was extensive but moved very quickly and efficiently. Now here is where it gets good... While waiting in line, hotel peeps offer you drinks. Not water, DRINKS!!! Of the alcoholic variety. They sure know the way to my heart, (or should I say, liver).

We were checked in within 5 minutes and the fellow at the front desk was super coo... Even stated that the valets are ""knuckleheads"" and to pay them no mind, lol.

Our room, while a bit smaller than we are used to was really nice, with a great view of the pool area and McCarran airport. (I'm a plane geek so that $hit gives me a boinker)... A view sweet enough to to happen to catch the Boeing 777 catch fire and burst into flames on the runway \/ tarmac. Glad everyone was okay too...

As for the resort itself, it has everything you need... A great pool area, (I'm too old and fat to hang there but we've seen it up close before so we know), great eateries, nice bars, (yay for me), and floor people that are there to serve your every need, all with a nice greeting and a smile. Plenty of tables \/ machines to spend your hard earned cash on too!!!

While it is off the beaten path a bit because of its location at the absolute south end of the strip, access to the other resorts isn't very difficult and \/ or is just a short cab ride away.

I'd have to say Mandalay is our new #1, (at least for now). We'll have to try Aria next to see if all M Resorts are just as nice...",21,20,20

It has replaced the Rio as my go-to Las Vegas hotel (sorry Rio, Mandalay is just closer to the action).  Rather you are here for a Family Trip, Romantic Weekend or Guys\/Girls Trip.. Mandalay Bay has you covered.  Which I find is difficult actually.  Most hotels aren't suitable for Family, Friends and Romance all at once.  Good planning MB.

I'm not sure what the ""theme"" of the Hotel is.  But is is very luxurious without the feel of pretension.  I don't feel like I have to put on a front when I walk through the doors (I do anyway, its Vegas I can be who I want).  

The clubs, restaurants, gambling and outdoor water activities are amazing here.  You could really never leave here and be fully entertained.

But, beyond all the extras the heart of a hotel is the room.  And any room you get here is exquisite.  I hate when you are deciding on a hotel room and they give you the impression that unless you book a suite you are no good.  MB has something for every budget.  The plush beds are very comfortable, and the soaking tubs are a nice addition to a weekend trip with a romantic partner.

Also, their concierge has a few connections to VIP lists at clubs.  Party Time.  Mandalay Bay, I cant wait to see you again.  Kisses.",3,3,2

In A Sentence™
A resort -- and they will let you know (Resortist marketing campaign) -- that offers nearly everything on the south end of the world famous strip.

Quick Review™
+   Arena, beach, club venue (HOB), some restaurants -- good and shitty -- a convention centre, aquarium, festival grounds, tram, gambling stuff, et. cetera.

-   Not enough parking. Not many options beyond driving*. (*Tram starts and ends Mandalay Bay\/Excalibur: covering a couple of blocks.)


Employee[s] of Excellence™ 
+  Jason (Department: House of Blues). This guy goes above and beyond that which is required every time he works. 
+  Daniel (Department: Lost & Found). This guy went above and beyond to provide superior customer service and thus also needs to be acknowledged.

Storytime™
Look man. I've been here a couple of times. (Check the check-ins!)
The end. (Why would anyone read on?)

There may be footage of me dating back to 2006, if they actually keep that shit. My first Las Vegas show was here (Blue October, HOB - 13 October 2006). (Hey, I'm not proud of that concert choice; there was nothing better that night ....) My next Las Vegas show will be here (Steel Panther, HOB - 19 February 2016). Bruv, everything in between has been a fucking ball. I love this town! 

Parking
Mandalay Bay used to be the place! Access from Russell and one of those Rat Pack roads -- I don't know -- it was perfect to park here and take the tram or whatever to where you were going if in the south. Then, they closed the Convention\/Shark Reef parking. Then, it went to shit. Parking is a chore now. Getting out is a pain in the ass since we have to use the goddamn garage. That garage is shit. (It's only getting worse.)

Casino 
No: I don't gamble. 

Hotel
I have never stayed here. I live here, for fucks sake!

Venues
Events centre is adequate. HOB is cool. Beach is alright. Festival grounds are barely okay. The Mamma Mia\/Lion King\/Michael Jackson theatre is sweet. 

Clubs 
No: I don't burn money. 

Restaurants 
A couple are alright. Aiiiiiiiiight.

Mall 
It kinda sucks. 


I once lost a car here. I don't know what happened. The guy at the security shack stopping cars from driving into the employee area must have been taking a shit or something. I drove all the way up (onto the employee level) and couldn't find the motor vehicle afterwards since it was in the employee parking instead of regular patron parking. I asked: would you guys ever tow a vehicle? No was the answer. Nailed it! You know how many times I have moved garbage receptacles and parked in makeshift ports I thus created after that? I've said too much. 

I've lost other shit here, not as big as a motor vehicle.

I made reservations with you for the entire weekend (9\/28-10\/2) a month prior. One of your associates misinformed us on the time to submit the Price Guarantee, and I had to cancel, my schedule got out of hand and time passed and when it was time to rebook the rates rose way up for the ROUTE 91 festival. We booked elsewhere but my fiancé was set on trying out your famous Pools, we decided to book a single day to dedicate to it. 

I had previously written a 1 star review because I didn't like how I was treated when I first had to cancel and explain that I was misinformed about the price guarantee. I later found your pool closed at 6pm and check in was 3pm and we were now only staying a day. I called and explained my situation to Brittany at the front desk and she assured me she would take care of us and let us access it earlier before our room was ready.

We arrive and explain to Shawnae everything...
Not only did she let us access the pool early, she comped the resort fee for the trouble we experienced previously, that's good business (we took that money and splurged on your $22 innertubes, which we normally would have said ""C'mon guys!"" but we paid it forward) Shawnae also gave us a complementary late check out so we could give the hotel an opportunity to show it was worth the time, it was. I'm not writing this solely because I got ""freebies"" it was the gesture, most people in customer service are empowered to take care of their customers so they can leave feeling positive about their experience and she did just that, she is genuinely dedicated to Customer Service. If I had 5 of her on my team at work, we would be unstoppable. Shawnae actually cared, she made us feel welcomed again, she reminded me of the majesty that made me and my fiancé on our first date want to one day be guest here. Thank you Shawnae. 

I would have been a guest the night of the SHOOTING if not for that employee who gave me the wrong info...for that and everything else I want to let you know, regardless I would gladly take pleasure in staying with you folks again without hesitation. It will always be a lucky and happy place for us. I hope all is well with you folks. PS the room was beautiful.",18,5,8

The rate for the room we received was fair, not the lowest we could have gotten on the strip, but certainly within reason. We normally travel to LV about 3-4 times per year for fun and\/or business. 

The biggest issue this trip was at check-in: we arrived at 6:30pm and we waited in line for 45 minutes to check-in. When we did get to the desk, we were told that they were sold out of the King Suite we reserved and we would have to stay in a room with 2 Queen beds. I know that this occurs when hotels are sold-out, but generally it happens when you check-in late at night and the hotel is down to their last rooms available. Both the front desk agent and the Asst. Front Office manager I spoke with had zero concern that we were not happy with not receiving the room type we reserved. Both of them offered no compensation and our only alternative was to wait for a King room to be cleaned. The AFO mgr made it clear that he didn't know how long it would take for a room to be cleaned and, after waiting for 45 minutes, we just took the room. I did take the card of the hotel manager and sent him an e-mail that night.

The room itself was an ADA accessible room--actually not bad compared to most of them. The walk-in shower was pleasant and the accommodations were comfortable. We were on the 33rd floor and faced the airport. The noise from the planes is pretty constant, even late into the night, but neither my girlfriend nor I are sensitive sleepers, so it didn't bother us and it was fun to sit in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows and watch the planes take off and land. We slept close together in one of the two queen beds.

The hotel manager answered my e-mail the next day and was apologetic, both for the wait and the attitude of the front desk staff. He made a nice offer to move us to a King room the next day, but by then we were settled in and did not want to pack up and move. He also offered us a Food & Beverage credit which was a nice accommodation.

Overall, the stay was average. I didn't win any money, but didn't lose much either. We used the F&B credit for a nice breakfast from room service. The food was good, but not great. My chief complaint really is more for the strip casinos in general. Over the past 20 years of traveling there, it really has gotten away from being a fun place to stay, eat and gamble and has now become a corporate conveyor belt of money. I understand the economics of MGM as a publicly-traded company and the ratchet effect that has on its assets. To meet their shareholders' expectations, they have to add more to the top line and trim more in the middle to get the most optimal bottom-line--I get it. But there's absolutely no room for fun and excess in there, which was why I used to like to go to Vegas. There's no way you can quantify giant fountains set to opera music, except that it's fun and I generally can't see them anywhere else. If I wanted a corporate money factory, I can go to any city in the world and stay at a Marriott.

Bottom line: the experience at Mandalay Bay was average and we'll consider it again, but probably only if they are offering a special deal that is better than Vdara's special deal.",0,0,0

First of all, I prepaid my room in July, but they have no record of it. I did the same function for three different people in my company, but they can't find my prepay authorization.....however Ashley in registration was nice.

I hate it when the small but obvious things are missing. The toilet has no trash can next to it and no fan in that section of the bath. There is no towel floor mat for when you exit the shower. No complimentary bottle of water is just low class. The beds here are short.

I tip my maid the first night and ask for a floor mat. It arrives the next day. I tip my maid again and the tip is gone but the trash is not emptied. The new maid card is not signed. 

The convention facilities are nice but lacking some logic. They have 3 escalators going up and one going down at the wrong time of the day which makes for a bottleneck. Rooms are partitioned but not labeled in alphabetical order. Need a secret decoder ring to know which level I am supposed to be on but the directing staff are polite. Large rooms sometimes missing microphones and projectors magnified too large that text is printing on the surrounding curtains.

Convention food....They only offer 1 type of fruit, red apple, at break. The food is often luke warm or ill prepared....bacon that is leathery like jerky but labeled as crispy. Cinnamon rolls are cold and stale though give the visual fake out being gooey and warm. Funky sugary cereal selections and staff that wants to take your plate while you are still holding your silverware. One of the waitstaff tells you go on to the next section, spread out, and I comply. I arrive at the next section and they say this buffet is not open yet, you have to go back....however everything is there and it is ready to roll. And to top it off I get to now go to the end of the line due to the bad direction.

Made the mistake of going to the Orchid bar. No beer on tap. Don't bother asking the waitress what style of beer 'random no one ever heard of' beer is. She doesn't know and can't read so she brings you a bottle and shows you the label. Beers come in the bottle, not with a glass. You cannot pay cash though you held your tab open via credit card.

At the elevator bank they rope of a section of the rotunda to invite certain people up. I couldn't tell what the criteria was for the invitation up except that it seemed to be males only. Males in our group just said it was a booze and appetizer spread but not a sausage fest.

The pool is closed. You cannot even sit by it or lunch near it.

I guess I expected more in an industry that prides itself on an amazing experience.  Granted, I'm tired. What a very long night right before a very busy conference.

Many of our family members booked a mini family vacation here for a July weekend several months in advance DIRECTLY from their web site. After getting a confirmation and putting down a deposit($230\/night) for our reservation, we thought that everything was set. What else could go wrong?

When we arrived around 3pm check in time after tired 9hr drive. My heart sank after they informed me that we no longer have a room because they were overbooked(was a busy weekend, boxing event). Now why on earth would you continue to book people for the hotel rooms when you know you ran out of rooms!!! Isn't it suppose to be first come first serve?  When you don't have enough rooms to rent out for a particular day, aren't you suppose to stop booking more people! 

As I later learned, we weren't the only people that have this problem on that day. I overhear many other guests that were just as pee off  as we were after getting bump from the hotel. 

After pleading with them to provide us a room(didn't care if its down or up scale) so we can stay with the family without staying 3 miles away from the strip, they still wouldn't give us our room. All they told us was that they were sold out and the typical customer service talk. The only thing they did was give us some taxi money and transferred our stay to their sister hotel Mirage(also owned by MGM) for a complimentary stay and refunded us the deposit. 

In hindsight, I suspect that they bumped us because there were more people willing to pay for a higher rate that busy weekend. So obviously if they pay more, that'd be more $$ for the hotel. Just weeks before I went, I often checked the price of the rooms and noticed that the rate gone up by 50%+. So it sounds to me that the highest bidder wins.  

What ever happen to  business integrity? Back in the days when you get a confirmation after making a deposit, its pretty much a done deal that you'll get your room.   If you don't mind rolling the dice, book this place at your own risk because of a confirmation don't mean anything.

In the future, I'll have 2nd thought about staying at any MGM properties. Definitely Mandalay Bay is no longer a place I'd stay. 

Good luck to all that plans to stay at this place.",1,1,0

SPA:
I always stay her because the spa was fantastic, now its just like going to Burke Williams, minus the discount.  If you are going to be cheap about what provide for snacks, have it reflect in your prices as well.  I'm paying over $600 for treatments and I'm going getting an apple and lemon water?  Are you joking?  Try harder.  I was stiff walking in, I left with a permanent crick in my neck.

Business Center:
Ummm, since when do you get charged a fee to have your luggage shipped before hand?  You charged me $15 dollars for your associate to kick my box to the front?  So I paid for the shipping and bad service.  Wow.

Still roomy, but the chipped furniture is a turn off.

When I checked in I was asked if I wanted a room overlooking the pool area. I was also warned that from 3 to 11 on Saturdays there is a live band by the pool. I was totally fine with it as I was not in my room during that time. I did however return to my room on Sunday night at 11 p.m. for a good nights sleep before my early flight the next morning. Hotels are ALSO for sleeping even if you are in Vegas. I laid my head down only to experience the thump thump thump of the base, the DJ and the strobe lights emanating from The Mandalay Bay Daylight Club on the other side of the pools that were below my window. WTF??? I was never told about this when I checked in to my room and I cannot believe that a hotel would have an outdoor club open until 3 or 4 a.m.  I am by no means a curmudgeon and like to party like the next person but REALLY??? I listened to this club crap for 3 hours just waiting for it to stop. Once it did, my head was pounding and my sleep left little to be desired. 

Other issues that I experienced were the long check-in line and the lack of elevators during the day. There were 8 elevators in my lobby. I waited while only two elevators worked. When they opened they were jam packed with customers and their suitcases on the way to leave. The same elevators would go up and down only to open with the same people. I ended up walking down 13 flights of stairs (with two other people) that took us through Human Resources dept. of Mandalay Bay. Not very secure if you ask
me.

Our view was amazing the Hotel staff were more than accommodating.. One thing to take into consideration when booking here is that the Mandalay Bay is technically at the end (or beginning) of the strip, depending on how you look at it. That didn't bother me, because I love to walk and I honestly got to legit ""walk the strip"". There is a bus stop outside the Hotel if you want to ride the shuttle down the strip (Walking is better and good for you. lol). 

The Mandalay Bay has the Foundation Room (which is a club) at the Top floor. It overlooks Vegas and they were playing some decent music (top 40's, with a little Hip-Hop and R&B). Also, the Mandalay Bay house two clubs (Daylight and Light) on it's premises. When I was there they had some pretty decent parties. 

I can't forget to mention how awesome the ""Beach"" was. I enjoyed the Wave pool. I wish the Lazy River was longer and had more winds and curves, but I guess it's ideally for kids.

RM Seafood motivated me to write a horror story review.
We picked this eatery since this was open early enough before the Michael Jackson show, a major bummer; we also love anything labeled as ""sustainable,"" and this was the only Vegas eatery labeling itself as sustainable, a huge mistake. Four of us stayed in Vegas sampling various restaurants. RM Seafood was the only Big No No. Whatever definition of ""sustainable,"" it was nothing akin to it. We were in for a worst dining experience in entire Vegas.

The initial source of the problem was that the tall guy waiter was simply deaf. He did not listen to any of the things we tried quite hard to communicate. We emphatically stressed Low Sodium for all dishes, not once but a few times. The mussel tasted like salted sardine, to exaggerate a bit. The organic veggie salad was so salty smothered with thickening and sickening dressing; it had nothing to do with ""sustainable.""  Four of us plucked up courage to dig into it, but we could not finish a half of it. Same story for the papaya salad. The heavy repulsive overkill dressing and sauces and salt basically sapped the original taste of fresh ingredients, like someone with a grotesque make-up so much so that the real face is unrecognizable. We wondered what the chef learned from the culinary institute. Also, if sustainable, the management should know better not to waste scare natural resources like that. They should notice how customers cannot even finish half of it, resting trashed, squandering precious limited energy, and human and natural resources.

The waiter never even bothered to ask us how we liked food. He seemed to be totally out of it; he seems there physically, but not really there. Instead, someone self-introduced as ""manager"" guy asked us how we weer doing. We usually let it slide, but this was too much, so we grumbled about it being to salty and all. His response was ""Oh!"" That's it. It was like shrugging off, saying ""Hey,  dummy, this is for tourists and transients like you guys. We can't care less."" He appeared to be a modest decent guy, but zero follow-up or any action. Even afterwards, our tall waiter guy acted as if nothing happened. 

Everybody in my party strongly asked me to write this review.

I give 1 star, merely since oysters and sushi plate was fairly good, although nothing to go back for. 

Unless we had awesome experiences at Jardin, Encore, the next morning,  JM almost could have entirely ruined our culinary experiences in Vegas leaving an uninviting after-taste. It almost already ruined the fabulous experiences the night before at L'Atlier Robuchon.

I also like that they spend an inordinate amount of time on the very shiny and slightly uneven floors. This place always tends to look nice and as far as events, they do a very solid job, from the sporting and sports books areas to various convention events, several of which seem to occur simultaneously.

This means this place is always packed with people and the inside tends to seem a lot like a mall, with a food court, clothing stores and other assorted bullshit along those lines. Everyone else does it to and I don't know who started it, so it's a big collective incestuous me-too affair. Good for them, I guess.

I (like apparently others) will just use my personal hotspot or 3\/4G!! 

Now to the room. I've stayed in cleaner Motel 6's. There was what my wife called boogers on the shower walls and something like dried Bon Ami (or Barkeepers Friend) on the bottom of the tub. The carpet may have been vacuumed sometime since we were last here 4 1\/2 years ago. There was an empty 1L water bottle under the chair and a bottle cap under the chaise. I used the ice tongs to remove the cap and put them in the tub with the rest of the used towels expecting to get a new one (more on that later).

We come back 6 hours later to get ready for our romantic dinner (we HIGHLY recommend Mon Ami Gabi in the Paris!!!!!! The filets are OUTSTANDING!!!!!) expecting to find a room that was sparkling clean. Well.... Still disappointed. The glass I left on the desk was still there where I left it. It appeared they wiped the desk AROUND the glass!! The plastic bag was still in the ice bucket with yesterdays melted ice. The lid was on the bucket (?) and tongs on top. Now, am I to believe we got clean tongs? I think not!!!! The carpet appeared to have been vacuumed this time, BUT... I had some raisins for a snack and spilled a couple on the floor. I figured this would be a good test and left them on the floor; in plain sight under the desk. They were still there when we got back. Continuing on to the bathroom.

I was there about 10 years ago and it was 5-stars all the way. But you have to work really hard to stay on top of the Vegas hotel game as there is always something newer, bigger and flashier coming around and this time, Mandalay Bay felt tired, worn and weary. The 3-star low score is due to many small details adding up - the little things that can make or break the experience. Examples - we got just one tiny bar of shower soap over our 4 night stay. Not plausible for 2 people. Badly stained carpets in the hallways. Room service from the previous night left outside our neighbors door till at least 2PM the next day, half a pizza and beer bottles were getting smelly. Small towels, scratchy and rough from all the bleaching - not soft and fluffy like you'd expect given the price of a room. No bathrobe! For that I dropped them a full star. And there were workers with power tools out in the hallway early Saturday morning, I just wish that if they absolutely had to be there, they would have warned us. Really, these kinds of distractions are not expected at this price. Service was generally okay around the hotel but it was reactive, never proactive as a really good 5-star hotel is.  No one went out of their way except towards the very end of my stay -- I left my bag with bag check because I had a 90 minute wait after checking out and before leaving for the airport. When I went to pick it up, it was lost. A charming and very helpful valet assisted me and we walked all of the areas where it might be stored, both downstairs and upstairs. Turned out it had never been transferred to the holding area, although I was clear what time I would need it and the valet wrote that down. If it weren't for the polite, persistence employee helping me I probably would not have found my bag in time to catch my flight.  I truly appreciated that he was willing to go the extra mile. Because of that, I added a third star, but otherwise they were dangerously hovering around 2 stars, which is odd for a hotel of their reputation. My last complaint - it's very ... beige. The rooms are dull & tired looking. It's time for a face lift, but maybe the management has moved on to bigger and better properties. All in all, Mandalay Bay still a nice place but the low review is also relative to the price and value.  Sadly, this once brilliant just doesn't deliver anymore.",0,0,0

We ate at their Bayside Buffet one night which was fantastic! Everything we ate was delicious and the meal (30.00) included wine, beer and champagne in unlimited amounts.  They had two live bands in small open areas within the casino that had dancing, we had a great time there!  

THE CONS:   We were charged more than 110.00 per night in taxes which really was an irritant ! There are 2 pools that we would have had to pay $50.00 each (for gentlemen) just to enter....let alone buy  a cocktail!

Like everything else in Vegas, this place is huge and it's easy to get lost. The hotel has great pools (a wave pool, a pool pool, a lazy river pool, etc) which is pretty family friendly. I also thought the Shark Reef Aquarium in the hotel (for an extra charge, of course) was also one of the best parts of the hotel.

The suite was really nice. Two large bedrooms, one with two queens and one room with a king. The queen room had a terrific tiled huge shower stall, which had a regular shower head plus a rain shower head above. The master suite has a jetted tub.

So why only three stars? Extra charge for wireless internet. I know you're not coming to Vegas to get online, but Holiday Inn has free internet.

The casino, restaurants and shops were nice and had a wide variety of options and price ranges. There is a free tram that runs from Mandalay Bay to Excalibur and if you walk from Excalibur to MGM you can get to the Las Vegas Monorail which takes you to several stops down the strip going all the way to SLS hotel so the fact that Mandalay Bay is at the end of the strip is kind of the worst excuse not to stay here.

The gym and spa is excellent if you are in Vegas for a wellness and relaxation few days. For shows you have plenty at Mandalay music cirque  cu soleil and music concerts. Rooms are ample modern  and with bathrooms  that still look new. Some rooms are not very new but are very well kept. Plenty of pools and even a wave pool and another area with sand. There's  a VIP wet area and even a topless optional adults only area. Also there is a shark aquarium pay to enter and  adjacent mall has some art galleries free of cost.  

Their rates during high occupancy can go high but Mandalay is not afraid to let the great deals and rate apply to its property. 
On top of everything ample self parking easy in and out easy access to highway and then a stop to two free monorail trams that can take you to luxor and Excalibur from there you take another walk and get on the other this one paying  monorail that can take you all the way to Westgate hotel. 

Great sportsbook to bet on sports and horse racing. It opens early and closes late. Quite a few of the bars have big screen so you can follow football games in case you have tickets on them :)

And this was on a Saturday afternoon.  No upgrades on the room were available.  When we got up to the room, it was less than impressive (decor was a bit dated) and it was on the small side.

We decided to get something to eat and tried the Raffles cafe.  We waited literally 50 minutes to get our food.  And when we finally got it, the food was horrible and way too expensive.

The casino was nothing special, spacious but dated.

Room service was way overpriced, our room was never cleaned, and even after calling them to come and get the table from the room service from inside the room... Housekeeping never came.

So there is the wave pool and the lazy river.  They were somewhat fun but WAY too crowded.  Even Sunday night at pool closing (which was 7pm) the pool was packed.

Finally there was the bill, tons of unexpected charges including resort fees and unmentioned extra fees for the room service.

- Close to the airport.

I get Per Diem and I get paid to attend. Woot. I am glad to be exhibiting Mandalay Bay  Convention Center and stay at Mandalay Bay Hotel. 

This review may not be lengthy due to the fact that I was there for 3 days and no way I am going to do step by step, but I will do my best. My boss and I arrived at Mandalay Bay around 12:30. We had to go check in with the convention center to drop off our cargo for the show. The convention center has many floors with many ballrooms. I won't state what convention due to security reasons, but there are a lot of business people attending at various floors. There are 3 floors, but each floor has like thousands of ballrooms. 

After we checked in, our hotel agent, Jessica, was very lovely. She joked around with my boss and tried with me, but I was serious about having my boss getting a key for my room. Thank you Jessica for our stay. Both my boss and I got got separate rooms for the 11th floor. I'll upload my photos, but there are 460 reviews...I think you know its a great hotel.

The hotel overall is wonderful except when it rains with lightning. Great thing our convention and room was under one hotel. The Convention staff helped us from Day 1 to the end. Food from the Mandalay Staff was AWESOME and I swear they spent over millions of dollars for our convention. Met great staff like the Security Agent Alicia. Alicia joked with me from not having my badge to not having talked to her. Sweet lady!!

Overall...you would forget that you were in Las Vegas, except the fact that you hear people shouting and slot machines making noises every second. I'll be back in Vegas for my mother's birthday. I didn't win this time, but lets see about next month. :)

IT WAS AWESOME!! My kid, 8 and 12 LOVED IT!! We had our friends with us they brought their kids 7 and 13:)

Water - The main attraction was a hit!! The pools, the wave pool, the lazy river - packed with families and lots of kids, it was not too crowded on a Thu but got real crowded on Fri, tip, don't do Fri\/Sat.

Someone from the hotel did comment on my review immediately and asked me to email them. I did email them but never received a response. This leads me to think that maybe they comment on people'e reviews to make the appearance that they are reaching out... anyway I had a nice stay at this hotel after all.

It is kind of slow on the weekdays but picked upon Friday. It is the last hotel on the south end of the strip. The famous Las Vegas sign is within walking distance (15 minutes). Close to airport, about $16-$19 cab ride. 

Be prepared to walk a lot specially if you're here for a conference as this hotel is very long and big. It took 15 minutes to walk from room to convention center. Elevators were also quick and staff and service was courteous. There are a lot of options for food...but not any ""must-eats"" for me. Skip the buffet here. I suggest going to the restaurants for happy hour at The Shoppes at Mandalay, especially Ri Ra. 

The room was spacious. The bathroom huge! There was two sink vanity, standing shower, soaking tub, and separate toilet room. 

Be warned- don't even touch the mini bar that is on top of the table! It has a weight sensor and you will get charged immediately. I saw on the tv (shows account info) that I was charged but the charge was reversed when they saw I didn't use anything. 

Also, the beach is closed for the winter. =( sadness as I was looking forward to it. There is a winter heated pool but I did not use. 

They have a lounge called The Foundation Room. Look around for a guy handing out free tickets by the elevator (I got 10 lol). After going through the bouncer, you take an elevator up to the 63rd floor. It's a lounge\/bar\/restaurant but we only went to see the view from their deck. The deck is small but on a weekday night it wasn't that crowded and the view is worth the cold!

Overall, this hotel\/resort is nice but generic. It doesn't have the appeal of some of the other hotels with themes. At least it's not tacky though. Very classy hotel. If you want to visit the strip, take the free tram that takes you to the Luxor and Excalibur and then walk from there. 

_________________________________________________________________________

I don't like to leave negative reviews but this is my first time in Las Vegas and I'm tired (3 hour time difference) and it took me 45 minutes just to check-in to the hotel. The line even doubled while I was in line. The front desk agent told me that she has never seen a line that long before.  Luckily I was on my phone but wi-fi is only free for an hour in the lobby. 

I also booked a king deluxe because I'm by myself for a work conference but they put me in a room with 2 queens. It just feels a little awkward since I'm all alone and I'll be here for 5 days. I called guest services and got hung up on so I tried another button on the phone and asked to put through and the lady promised to stay on the line until someone picked up. The front desk agent was very polite but said they did not have any king rooms and that they could put me on the list for a room change tomorrow. I asked if I had to be there since I'll be in a conference for the whole day and won't be back to my room until night time.. They said it's not guaranteed and that I would need to be there to change rooms... So I really don't have an option. So I guess I'll just keep everything packed up just in case. 

At least I kind of have a view? I'm not sure... I am on 8th floor looking at something... I didn't pay extra for a ""view"" room though. 

I'm tired, hungry, emotional, upset... Not a great way to start my first time in Las Vegas. I know it's beyond their circumstances but it's also not guests' fault that they overbooked and do not have the adequate staffing and rooming to handle a large conference. 

I'll update review once I get through the week...

Just a note:  they charge a $15 resort fee.  We didn't know about it until we checked in.  Boo resort fees!

I had access to the entire beach and pool areas due to a friend who got tickets to the Chicago concert, which included an armband that gave us entree to those other areas.  I was really impressed with what I saw.   The concert stage was at the faux beach, out on the water.  We got there late so the entire sand area was full of people and the stuff they laid out to save their spots as they wandered into the water (many of them fully clothed). 

I stuck to the edge of the water but a couple of small waves got the cuffs of my pants wet.  When I say the ""edge""  I mean I stood on a metal grate that prevents the water from reaching the sidewalk\/path between the water and the beach. This grate area is sloped and a bit slippery, but security guards were making sure people weren't blocking the path, so it was the only place to stand.  

The sound system was great regardless of how far away we were from the stage, and we wandered throughout the place, including taking the elevator upstairs to where pools with huge, upholstered chaise lounges and furniture were located.  Very nice!  It was nighttime, so I had to warn my friend at one point not to fall into one of the small pools- we really had to watch our step to avoid falling into a pool. 

The small outdoor bar had a flat screen TV showing the concert stage, but it was also nice walking to the rail and looking down on the performance and all the people. I can't remember the price of the drinks but they were expensive. 

I don't know what this place is like in the daytime or when there's not a concert going on, but it was very attractive that night, and the great performance by Chicago (and the happy crowd) made the experience very enjoyable. I would definitely go to another concert there, but I'd get there early enough to snag a spot on the beach.",0,0,0

The room was very clean and updated... (12332) the decor was sleek and modern... the view was decent (we could see the mountains, the Delano and Luxor).  I felt very comfortable in the room (didn't hear any neighbors or club music at odd hours of the night)... The only thing I'd change - higher thread count sheets!!!!  When I'd toss and turn at night I'd get sheet burns (equivalent to rug burns) on my knees and elbows!!! 

The elevators are super fast - staff was decent (valet guys super nice, promotors - not as annoying as those at The Luxor).

We explored the casinos at the other hotels we wandered through and I can say I felt most comfortable at mandalay's casino.

Food was top notch.  Had the best steaks of our lives at StripSteak.  Excellent hamburgers and beer at Burger Bar.  Craps tables were $15 min both Sat and Sun.

Checkin: We arrived on a Friday in late September at 8pm.  Less than a 10min wait and no problems with our room.  Rooms were well appointed and clean.  

Tip:  Pick the 17th floor or as close as you can to minimize elevator transit times.  We were on floor 31 with a nice view, but most trips required multiple stops. 

Pool:  We booked the stay specifically for the pool and were not disappointed! Sand, chairs, lazy river, two pools and a fun but quickly boring wave pool. Saturday we arrived at 9am and had no trouble getting seats.  We stayed until 3pm.  It was really busy at 11am and beyond, but what do you expect.  Been to MGM Grand and Mirage and those pool ares were just as busy but not nearly as nice   Reserve chairs were $50 each, but they were always available so if you need one..

The pool was amazing.  They could do more to make the wave pool more fun, such as allowing rafts or increasing the wave frequency (currently one per minute).  They seem overly concerned with safety...I don't usually say that but wow they are careful and stringent on the rules.

Tip: The sun gets pretty intense.  If you want shady seats look for the chairs between the wave pool and the lazy river or near the West Lagoon cabanas.  

Event center:  Attended a concert.  Good clean facility.  A little dated, but did the trick.

Shopping: Marketplace has some shopping.  Connects to Luxor if you are looking for cheaper tables or a darker sadder casino experience.  Bodies was there and is worth checking out.

Kids:  The little people almost always annoy me!  Just seeing a child on a trip to Vegas makes me angry.  Still there were not that many, even at the pool, and most parents immediately corrected the children.  So not a big deal.

Overall a great trip that met expectations with none of the problems encountered by other reviewers.  The people were not old, the casino was super clean, the rooms were nice.  What's the problem?",4,1,0

Not a busy casino and plenty of parking available. No line during check in on a Tuesday. Be careful touching any food items or drinks in the room unless your prepared to pay for it. Drinks in frig have sensors, there's also a charge for the water and coffee in the room.

Customer service at registration: I give it a 1 star due to leaving customer with extra charges when room preference was requested but not given even though room was available. Booked Deluxe room with preference of nonsmoking and double beds. Came to Vegas on Tuesday 6\/14th. Registration staff first asked what preference then gave following options:
1. King size bed- no up charge
2. Two queen size beds, smoking room- no upcharge
3. Two queen beds nonsmoking-additional $25 per night. (So this was originally my preference and they had the room but now they are insisting if I want it I have to pay extra because they only have city view available. Which to me is odd because they are saying two queen beds nonsmoking  without city view is all booked up?? Lol....forcing you into a room with City view so they can do the surcharge...hmm interesting).

So, if you really  have a bed preference make sure you book ahead of time and pay during your initial booking. Because preference at a non busy hotel during check in will cost you more $$$ even if they have the room (this was for sure a first time experience, never been up charged like this before or felt cornered in all the years visiting Vegas). 

Parking: All M life (MGM) property charges for self parking with the exception of 2 of their properties ( Circus Circus and Signature towers). If your a guest staying at the hotel. $10 per day self park (unexpected, started 6\/2016, 0-60 min is free. We went to visit other hotels and parking was still free at this time.) You can check online if you want to know which properties are charging parking fees and how much on Vegas.com look under parking garages or you can just google parking fees Vegas hotels. I was just here in Vegas January 2016 for a conference so I was pleasantly surprised about MGM properties charging for parking.

Resort fee: All these fees are on top of the resort fee that is also charged $33 per day ( expected, as all hotels have been charging this fee but pricing might be different depending on the hotel). The resort fee covers gym, pool and wifi.

Called manager on duty Wednesday of my stay because it just didn't feel right. Spoke to Nicole and told them customer service is not great. I visit Vegas once a year but this is my second trip this year and I've never encountered a situation where hotel has bed preference but would not give it. Nicole states many people want double beds with city view so they can't afford to give it out without charging. I wasn't asking for city view, I was asking for nonsmoking double beds. Lol, I think with all the new hotels maybe it's slow at Mandalay Bay so registration clerks will pick and choose who they will charge extra since our package we booked was a  pretty good deal (especially since we were going Tuesday thru Thursday). I'm glad I rented a car, we decided not to eat, shop or gamble at Mandalay Bay. 

Just be aware of extra charges at this hotel. I've stayed at other properties in the past and most likely will stay at other properties than here. Don't like to be lied to and customer service is really important especially in the service industry. It was more about the way they went about charging that felt deceitful and dishonest.

6\/16\/16: Thank you Lori for your response. I never asked for room upgrade. I only asked for two queen beds nonsmoking didn't care about the view because majority of the time we are out. But staff would not give two nonsmoking double beds without the surcharge and limiting my choices knowing our preference. Most hotels if they have a room of the clients preference will give it. Other hotels have also given free upgrades if room preference is available but only difference is view vs no view. It's a customer service issue for sure. I also understand the hotel needs a lot of $$$ to run operations. But a happy customer will return and spend more $$$ and a unhappy one normally will tell as many people as they can about their experience.",4,1,3

Review #3:
Mandalay Bay = this place may be my favorite of all of them; first of all, it's huge - you can get totally lost roaming around the convention\/ballroom area; plus it is attached to The Delano (formerly THE Hotel), which is still being finished but you can already sense the chill & casually hip vibe, and attached to The Four Seasons, which is high-end without being stuffy (check out their beautiful pool\/gardens area); the casino is not overwhelming, and the focus seems to be more on the awesome restaurants & bars; plus The House of Blues lives here; Mandalay Place has fun shops and good, affordable eats & drinks; by the way, the ladies generally look smoking hot, especially those headed into Light nightclub; best craft beer bet = Burger Bar (in Mandalay Place; their selection is as good as it gets on The Strip)",4,3,4

We were able to make our reservations for a Birthday dinner at Stripsteak over the phone, which was quick and simple.

I checked in my bags for storage until 5:30 p.m.. I checked in 5 bags (one a Prada purse) with the bellman. As I walked down the hallway, he yelled out to me and asked if I needed the magazines on the floor too? I replied Yes! ... At that point, he should have changed the ticket to 6 items, but he didn't. When we picked up the bags with the bellman at 5:30 p.m., my husband picked up 5 items which included 4 bags & magazines as the 5th item.

Shortly, after we left I noticed my Prada purse was missing. We drove immediately back to the hotel and approached the bellman who gave us our bags. He stated he gave us 5 items period. I argued that we were missing a bag and that he only gave us 4 bags not 5! He said the magazines counted as the 5th item. Exactly! I checked in 5 bags total and with the magazines it should be 6. But the first bellman never changed it to 6 items! 

So, the manager comes over to talk to his staff and then talks to us. He tells us to look around the bellman storage room to see if my Prada purse is around. Then, he walks us to our car and checks to see how many bags we had, and concluded the Prada bag was missing. We filed a report with the security guard and he told us that the case will go to Risk Management. 

Several weeks later, Risk Management called and informed us that they reviewed our case and that we checked in 5 items & they gave us 5 items. Case closed. We were livid! After all that with the manager telling us he confirmed there was a mistake and a bag was missing. Our word against there's! Absolutely absurd. NOTHING from risk management, except for check with your home insurance.

So, if you check your bags in make sure you have the correct number of items, & if there are any changes make sure the bellman changes it on the ticket. I shouldn't have to double check someone else's job duties.

Something is definitely not right here. Under the circumstances, theft could be a real issue here. It isn't fair to the hotel guests that a luggage or purse is missing and there is nothing the bell desk, risk management or the hotel could do. 

Recently, there were employees arrested at LAX for stealing people's personal belongings in their luggage. I would not be surprised if this was happening at the bell desk.",5,0,0

The rooms are very specious, the receptionist was very nice and said he would give us a room in on of the top floors (30th) which meant we would have a nice view and we did.  The bathroom was really big, I mean for three women to be able to get ready (make up and hair)  in one bathroom and the same time, it had got to be pretty big.  Everything is granite and marble.

Oh.... one of my favorite parts about staying in hotels are the robes, some hotels have crappy ones and some have super nice ones, Mandalay Bay has very nice fluffy robes as well as slippers.  When I called and asked for a robe, I figured they would bring me one... nope!   They brought three, one for each person in the room.  Now that's some good service, and they threw in the nice comfy slippers.  

The only reason why I am not giving them 5 stars is because they don't lend the floating devices for the lazy river.  Some people travel from far places and the last thing that want to bring home is a floating tube as a souvenir.  And they are around $25, so don't forget to bring your own tube.  And they also have certain areas that you have to rent chairs to sit in.  Now that is a little ridicules, I have been to resorts in Mexico that are just a as nice and also rated high and they do not rent for you to sit in specific areas of the pool.  Although its a little off the strip I would highly recommend this hotel.",0,0,0

The pool complex is great but closes at 6pm. No in-room coffee maker. Had to go across the street and buy vodka to sneak into the pool like the college kids were doing. Servers and concierge staff were surly and dismissive.

I went back in the morning and again they told me that it wasn't going to be possible to change to a king room and that I shouldn't try again.

Secondly, they charge you for parking now. $10 to self park and $18 for valet. Even if you are staying at the hotel!!

Very cool dude.  He got my buddy and I rooms pretty close to each other on the same floor on a fight weekend. He just really took the time out and seemed to care.  Got there early in the morning on Friday so here's some of the stuff

Pool- Did a cabana on friday.  It was right on the lazy river.  Service was good and Mario actually brought us an Ipod radio deck to play in the cabana.  They give you inner tubes to float on which was nice.  There are a lot of kids at the pool.  So if you're not really into that than maybe the pool area isn't for you.  But if you have a cabana you are away from that at least.

Rooms- Water was hot, bed sheets were clean and had a stocked fridge. All I really care about.  

Ate at some cantina by the burger bar.  Food wasn't very good.  

Steel Panther- If you got some time around midnight on friday and only want to spend $20 to get in go check these guys out. Not only do they play their own songs, they cover sweet 80's tunes and are funny as hell.  Place was packed.  

Mix Lounge- At the top of The Hotel. If you are into hip hop and rap head up there on Friday night.  Definitely the other side of the spectrum from Steel Panther. But fun regardless.  Good dance hip hop music.  

Saturday morning ate at the cafe  downstairs.  Eh is really all I can say. But stacie our server was really nice.  

Bayside Buffet is also very good by the way.  

Like I said earlier it was fight weekend so the place was packed. Never really had the dreaded elevator problem that everybody seems to talk about on here. Only once did it take awhile to get downstairs.

Case in point was Mandalay Bay which was offering a two-night stay for less than $400 and then offered an upgrade to a junior suite for just $20 more per night. Who wouldn't go for a deal like that? Now I've been to Mandalay Bay a few times over the years and always for some kind of corporate gathering where your colleagues are uncomfortably in the next room making noises that you don't dare acknowledge.

This time, however, Jamie W. and I decided to take a quick getaway weekend and had the gumption to buy tickets to the Cirque du Soleil Michael Jackson ONE show (review: http:\/\/bit.ly\/24ND3RZ). As we tend to find better and more affordable dining options away from the Strip, I rented a car and found it pretty easy to park, at least after a bellman at the main entrance explained how I needed to maneuver the winding driveway to find the parking structure. Once parked, I shouldn't have been surprised that you have to pass a lot of their restaurants and the entirety of the casino before finding the registration desk.

A queue is a given, but it was a relatively quick wait. Once we got to our room on the 26th floor, we were thrilled how spacious the junior suite truly was and how large the bathroom was (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/1RxP5oP). I have to admit what I like the most about Mandalay Bay is its outlier location relative to all the other big hotels. The casino feels less crowded as do the ground floor restaurants. We didn't have time to enjoy the wave pool or beach this time around, but we took advantage of reasonably priced dining options like Citizens Kitchen & Bar and Crossroads at the House of Blues.

We booked Mandalay out of sheer curiosity, having seen it last year when we stayed at the amazing Mgm Signature and went to Mandalay for the Shark Reef. We saw the beach part of Mandalay and we were impressed. We got a good deal through Travelocity, so we jumped on it. We got a ""deluxe room"" which includes nothing. No spa tub, no dvd player, no coffee maker, no fridge. It was a LUMPY bed, dirty or stained linens and towels, and thats just the room... 
The pool was even worse. There is very little room near or around the pool area. You have to be out there in a chair by approximately 8, 8:30AM to get a chair. This is so ridiculous. The ""Wave"" pool was even more of a joke. Its gorgeous, but there is 1 teeny wave every 7 minutes or so. This does not a wave pool make. The ""lazy"" river, another amenity we booked for, was also awful. First of all, you have to bring a tube from home, or buy one in the Walgreens on Las Vegas blvd. Mandalay does not rent tubes, but sells them at $25 and better. No thanks. We brought out awesome $10 tubes from CVS in Staten Island. Lol. The lazy river, isnt lazy at all. Its FAST. Which would be nice, if there weren't so many road blocks in the river. Meaning, people are allowed to walk thru, swim thru, or just hang out in the river without a tube. This is retarded. There are a bunch of other pools right next to the lazy river. If you want to swim so bad, get out of the lazy river and hit a pool. What the hell? You're whipping through the lazy river on your tube unable to stop or control where you are going, and you bang into some kid or their mom in the river coz they're standing there like they're waiting for a bus and its MY fault? I don't think so. We went around once or twice and that was enough for our liking. We got out, deflated our tubes and head up to the South Lagoon pool. A fine choice if you have to stay at this hotel. Its quiet up there, there aren't many kids around (they're all at the wave pool\/lazy river), and you can get a chair anytime you get up there. There is also a jacuzzi. Oh- btw- NO ALCOHOL allowed in the pool...hello??? Isnt this Vegas where you can drink walking down the street???
Next, the elevators. OMG. You could spend your entire trip trying to get from your room to the pool in the elevators. There are only 6 elevators for floors 17-34. They are slow and ALWAYS packed!! We waited a good 35 minutes to get from the 23rd floor to the pool. Insane. 
The only saving grace of Mandalay is Burger Bar, Fantastic place! Fun, Customize your own burgers and now shakes. Love that joint. We were in Mandalay for 3 days when we decided to escape to a nicer hotel on the actual strip.We took our luggage in one hand and our burger bar take out order in the other and fled!!  This hotel is WAY TOO FAR away from EVERYTHING!!!! That is a reason in itself NOT to stay here. Yea they have the tram, but by the time you get off the tram @ Excalibur and walk all the way across to NY NY and then across again to MGM to walk thru their casino to get to the monorail, you and your feet are exhausted. Also- The Tram is NOT 24 hours!!! We were stranded on the strip, and had to take a cab back to the hotel, which was pricey, since you are way off strip, and the traffic lights in Vegas are the  longest I have ever seen. The cab meter goes up FAST!
Add on that the hotel staff was completely useless and whenever you tried to get Concierge to help you, it was like they were doing you some favor. There is no button on the phone for concierge, so when you call the front desk for help, they answer with a ""Thats not us, thats concierge"" and they transfer you.  We gave up on this hotel on day 3 of our 8 day trip and escaped to Paris!! What a difference! Omg. Please see my Paris review for more info, as I have taken up enough space here. Ps- buffet was not that good. We had salad, lamb, bad sushi, and dessert. Now that they have this ""one price, eat all day thing"", the quality of the food has suffered. This is bad, because as you can see on Yelp, most of the other restaurants in Mandalay have awful reviews. Therefore, you are almost forced to leave your hotel for decent food, and therein lies the issue of the hotels location.",2,2,2

On the surface, the facility is nice, but (like Rebecca T. said), I was offended by the nickel-and-diming of things that I expect to be free and available. For example, 1 PM checkout was $40 extra. No refrigerator. No Microwave. Food all priced at 2X ""normal"". Cigarette smoke permeates all public areas. Movies are $11. I watched a current (in the theaters) movie, which repeatedly froze and restarted.

Check-in took 2 hours and I was forced to switch from Delano to Mandalay Bay, although I must admit I don't know whether that was caused by the hotel or the ""convention"" for which I was registered and which had provided my ""confirmation"" number.

The walls MUST be thin...definitely not acoustically well insulated...Don't dare of think of doing any hanky panky here, or even inviting a few friends over in the evenings...For me that would be a No-NO!

Where's my free coffee?  No free coffee??  To use their prepacked coffee cups is $5!!  I'm so utterly disappointed. Normally these are the freebies!

OK, nagging put aside...I have to say, I enjoyed the shoppes linking the Mandalay Bay to the Luxor.  I bought me some shoes, and my hubby had the privilege of meeting Pete Rose in the Art of Music store.  For that alone, he loves his place.

The other BIG PLUS was the hotel's great pools, spas, sandy beach\/wave pool AND the lazy river!!!   There is no inner tube rental...They are only provided if you chose to rent a $350 per day cabana...The other option, which we did, was purchase the inner tubes from the surf shop - $18 for the small, $22 for the large...I thought they were cool, so I purchased one...

Is the roses I smell? I swear everytime I come into this hotel it smell so nice and refreshing!! 

One of my favorite place to eat is in this hotel, Burger bar, super yummy, I always come here when I go to Vegas. It's a must! 

Set up of casino is nice, tons of machine and tables, cocktail waitress are always walking around to serve you drinks! It's really nice and clean hotel. 

There was a sign that was given to me when I first stepped into this place, sat down to find a cocktail waitress, sat in front of a Roulette machine, put in a dollar, stupid me bet on black BUT I usually always bet on 29, why? It's my daughter's birthday! 
Do I even need to explain what happened? Hit 29 black, yay, I won freaking a dollar, verses, 36 to 1! It's a sign! 

Decided to put 20 bucks into a deal or no deal penny machine, why not, I am down so much already, going home broke, so what the hey, just leave it all in Vegas! 

Sat down for 10 mintues, hit the briefcase game and some other wild stuff which gave the highest amount of money you could of gotten was 1,000. Needless to say, I didn't really pay attention until I was offered 34,375 pennies, uhm honey, can you take out calculator for me and figure that out...uhm that's 343.75 babe. WHAT! Deal!

Hotel was nice inside, clean and most of the staff was very friendly. I knew ahead of time that there was a $25 resort fee per night per room....no big deal. What I had a problem with was the resort fee was for the pool, cardio room, newspaper and wifi. The wifi was horrible!!! It was so bad that I couldn't even check into my flight the morning I was leaving. I couldn't upload photos, send business emails etc. charging people for a service that they can't really use is terrible. Shame on them. The resort fee also included use of the pool. If you wanted to go on the lazy river you had to pay $20-$35 (depending on which tube you pick) for a tube. So your saying we pay a report fee which includes pool use but we have to pay more money to ride the lazy river? I am not cheap by any means but we dropped a lot of money in that hotel and I think it's crazy to ask your guests to pay extra to ride the lazy river. We only wanted to go in it for maybe 10 mins. Besides that its an average hotel and if you get a deal on expedia go for it. I've been to Vegas many times and its hard to compare it to the other places I have stayed because they were all high end hotels. This is not but for the deal I got its worth it. One major con is the casino is very outdated. The waitresses are nasty and take forever to give you a drink. (Don't order the champagne it's like sparkling apple juice). My husband and brother in law were playing craps and had over $1,000 on the table and I had just lost some money playing blackjack so I walked over and watched while they played. I asked for a champagne and this nasty lady told me unless I play I can't have a drink. Really? I was just playing over an hour of blackjack and got 1 drink because the waitress took forever to bring it to me. Now I'm with my husband and he is playing big money and you can't bring me a sparkling apple juice? My brother in law gives her a five dollar bill and she said ""don't think that will help, sorry"".

The dice tables were extra nice to me, but the blackjack, slots and every other game you can think of were extra mean!

I want to give this hotel a good ranking.... I just can't.  The pool situation was like some sick combination of 1930's Ellis Island and the Japanese Internment camps.  

Lets start out with a little background.  Went to Vegas for my sisters 21st birthday.  My extended family and friends always join in on a trip to Vegas.  Probably had about 30-35 people there for the festivities.  The majority of these people are a bit older and cant handle being out in the heat all day.  They needed a cabana.  

My pops and I tired to reserve a cabana when we checked in (mind you we had 5 rooms reserved under the same name, you would think they could hook us up).  No dice; can't reserve a cabana, you need to go wait in line to get one tomorrow morning.  

My dad woke up at the ass crack of dawn to grab a cabana; he was the first in line.  After 100+ people lined up for a cabana a man walked out of the reservation office and said. ""We have 2-3 cabanas left to purchase; they start at $450, then $650 and $750.  Chairs can be reserved for $75 and the umbrellas are $50"".  I couldn't believe my ears! Where do they get off making people wait in line spend almost a g-note on a cabana only to spend $100s on drinks and food!  The casinos must be hurting because they are trying to make all their cash at the pool!

With multiple pools, lots of seating (although no shade unless you pay an arm and a leg for it), and a beach, it's a great area to hang around on a sunny afternoon.

The hotel itself is decorous. It also has great food options (I enjoyed breakfast at Raffles) and bar options. Both items are very important for a Vegas hotel. 

The carpeting in the room itself was in desperate need of a good cleaning or replacement. I do not really want to be reminded of the years of partying that it has endured...

Also, as numerous reviews below have mentioned - the elevators at times took FOREVER. I thought people were exaggerating. No, they were not - and I have been in Vegas for multiple New Years Eves when there are masses of people trying to get to their rooms - this was worse.

The reason for only 2 stars, and my biggest complaint, was our check-in experience, and our overall customer service at this hotel. The woman that checked us in was very rude to us (making fun of our name!), not helpful when asking about upgrades (yes, I was trying to give them more money!), and then gave us the wrong room number!! After waiting an hour to get an elevator to go to our room to find that someone else was already in that room, we had to trek it all the way back to the desk, where she insisted we were mistaken and we should try again! Then, after looking at her computer says, ""oops, I was a number off"". And then essentially pushes us off to help the next guest. I realize people make mistakes all the time, no biggie, but a simple ""sorry for that"" would have gone a LONG way.

We experienced more rude workers at the pool, valet and our service at Raffles was beyond slow. 

All in all, I have stayed at most hotels on the strip (from the Imperial Palace to Encore), and this was the worst for customer service. Why spend the money to stay there when there are so many other options that still value customer satisfaction??",4,0,1

I work in hotel ownership so I am aware of how hard hotels are working to encourage people to book directly through the website and not on third party booking channels like Expedia. I know that people who book through Expedia get lower quality rooms. When we checked in, we let the agent know that even though we had booked a 2 queen room, if there was a king room (which was actually cheaper when we booked it) we would take that instead. What we ended up with was a 2 queen room with a view of the parking garage. Definitely an ""Expedia"" room. Our friends, who booked after us, ended up in a beautiful room on the 21st floor with a great view. Also, when they checked in, their agent told them about all of the amenities at the hotel and gave them passes to Daylight and Light. Our agent gave us nothing and no information.

After visiting Vegas for decades, this was the first time we've ever stayed at the Mandalay Bay Resort. 

We stayed in an accessible room so there was a lot more room between the beds and desks. The beds were comfy and the room temperature was ideal for great nights of sleep. 

The bathroom was large with a shower, tub, sink and toilet all in the same room. No separate toilet room. In our room we (I) accidentally tripped the lights a couple times and figured out we could reset it at the outlet. I thought I broke it!  LOL!

The pool area was amazing and our girls LOVED it! Aside from learning that they rent a $75 red umbrella and $75 red lounge chair, it was pretty good. Just FYI, there isn't any shade in the sand beach area so be prepared. 

The lazy river was small but the good thing was we weren't required to buy a tube ($18 small\/$22 large). Some people brought their own or you could just walk or float through. 

The girls loved the beach area and wave pool the most. The waves ran every 90 seconds and you had to stay behind a blue line so you wouldn't crash into the shore. It was refreshing to walk in and get a quick dip then come back out to lay out and read a book. 

Food and drinks are pretty pricy. Our $5 fries were a good deal. They were fried well and we had a large portion served in a to-go container (about half full). BUT...Beware the 8 OUNCE smoothies that are $10 each!  They were pretty yummy but I don't think I'd get it again.  I think Hubby's 20-ounce souvenir cup for $12 was actually the best deal.

Im a M life memeber so my discount was nice for the weekend! Dont open any of the snacks or alcohol if your not willing to pay for it!! Other than that no complaints!!,0,0,1

It was my first choice because we went in August and I had heard that their pool and beach were the best on the Strip. It was a bit of a disappointment. At check in, I wanted to ask about an upgrade to a larger room, but was flatly refused anything other than a standard 550 sq ft 2 queen room. All suites were booked, nothing available larger than the above. 
As soon as I got to the room, I tried to book a cabana for the next day. They had 2 options: one was $325 and the other was $500. This is significantly more than I paid for the room! We decided to take our chances on finding shade. When we went to the pool on Saturday, we could not find a place to sit. Every chair was taken and we ended up folding up our things and piling them in a corner so we could go in the pool. It was not a high-end luxury experience to say the least. Later in the afternoon, we found some chairs in a remote pool area, but it certainly wasn't anything like what I expected. Before booking, I had pictured drifting along the lazy river in a tube, but I never even went in the lazy river. It was full of rambunctious kids and little infants. No thanks. 
That evening after dinner, we went to one of the casino bars. I put money in the video poker machine, and we ordered and paid for a round of drinks. When I was ready for another drink, I asked the bartender and he refused to serve me unless I bet the maximum on the machine. I didn't even know what he was talking about. The dude was seriously rude and I was completely baffled. To this day, I don't know why he was so unfriendly. As I said, we'd already bought drinks, I had paid to play, my cute younger sister was up on the dance floor dancing with some dorky bachelor party guys. Why would he be so rude? Fortunately, there are many, many bars in Vegas, so we moved on quickly. Everywhere else we went, staff and other customers were friendly, hospitable and fun. Overall, we had a great vacation, and Mandalay Bay didn't ruin it, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it for a girls getaway. Maybe for families with kids it's fun.",1,0,0

Which when you're primary use of a place is to sleep in it, is kind of bad. The rooms are beautiful, comfortable and well laid out. The shower is roomy, has great pressure and will burn your damn flesh off if you're not careful. There was also a really nice garden style tub that I didn't get the opportunity to use. 

The beds on the other hand were very spongy and felt like they were going to tip over if you weren't laying directly in the middle. I've honestly never experienced anything like that. Also, they tacked on a $25 fee for some nonsense at the front desk that included internet. I wasn't thrilled with that. Other than that it was an enjoyable stay.

Update: Apparently they added several charges to my card that weren't supposed to go through and now getting them to remove them is becoming a hassle. Also the ""resort fee"" was explained as being $25 per room. What it really is is $25 per room, per day plus 12% tax on top of that. So besides the normal room cost, there is an additional $112 tacked on to the bill. This was the first and last time I will stay at the Mandalay Bay.

You have lived up to all of our very high expectations! (for the point of reviewing, we left Mandalay after a few nights and headed over to the ""New Trop""... and all I can tell you is that I wish we were still at Mandalay Bay, instead we'll be spending another dreadful night over here at Tropicana.... FAIL). 

From Valet to the Bellman to Check-in to the location, quality, cleanliness and view from our room... you've truly outdone yourself. 

Mandalay Bay offers an incredible value, tons of light in the floor to ceiling windows, extremely large rooms and bathrooms to die for (even in the regular rooms). The rooms, if you're into having a good one, are pretty great at Mandalay Bay!

The hotel is still beautiful, even though it's not the newest, it still shines. 

When it comes to gaming, there is something for everyone and it doesn't disappoint for every $ level of gamer. Video poker to video craps (a must, $3.00, as opposed to $10 on the floor... huge dice, tons of fun). The cocktail waitresses are quick and friendly and the drinks (at the Video Poker bars) are top shelf! We'd ask for Brenda, she was a bartender at the video poker bar, by Mizyua sushi. She's a hoot (and pours a wicked reposado and lime)! There's a lot of great gaming at this fabulous casino! High ceilings, not smokey, open and wildly fun & bright! 

Dining abounds at Mandalay Bay. We dined at several of the restaurants there... including; The Border Grill (twice), Hussong's Cantina (in Mandalay Place), Mizuya and Aureole (bad experience, see that review for more info). Overall, the caliber of dining is out of this world. If you're a celebrity chef fan... there is no shortage of exceptional choices. 

Entertainment is everywhere at Mandalay Bay! We took our 5 month old son to Shark Reef... and while it was small and expensive ($18 each, son was free), he loved seeing all the fish and lit up at the array of colors and things to look at. Us grown ups visited the House of Blues for Rockstar Karaoke (karaoke with a live band) and that too, was a great time! 

If shopping or getting a tattoo is more your thing, you can do both right on the property.. Several specialty shops, some favorites and a salon...

The pool at Mandalay wasn't open just yet... but it's clearly a highlight of the property. Lazy river, wave pool, plenty of cabana's, gaming... seems like a great place to break away from the heat and cool off (or work on your tan). 

All in all, we were VERY impressed with Mandalay Bay and will absolutely be back! 

Mandalay also has some FourSquare offers.... so check in and take advantage of those too!",4,0,1

My first two times, I stayed at Luxor (which I actually loved) but I decided to try somewhere new and with a ""better"" rating. Big mistake. We walked into the hotel to check in, only 2-3 workers checking people in, with an enormous line that only kept growing. I thought, ""Oh well, Luxor always had a line too, this shouldn't take TOO long."" I was wrong. We waited an hour and a half, (others who waited less were already complaining, by the way) and it wasn't until we got to the front of the line that they brought people from ""other departments"" to help. 

So, it's finally our turn in line and I give the lady my name, when I asked how much it would be to upgrade to a suite, she said ""they are all booked,"" (on a Monday), even though she had just given the guy in front of me an upgrade (for free I assume, based on how grateful he seemed.) No big deal, I thought. I just wanted to get checked in to put my things away and get some food. So, next she tells me I have $100 food and drink credit that I could use at ""any restaurant"" in Mandalay, and if there's ""any problem at all, tell them to call the front desk, and we'll take care of it."" She said this very confidently.  My boyfriend got excited since we only expected $75. She then told us we had two options as well, either pay $100\/day and use it as room credit, keeping the remainder at the end of our stay, OR pay for food\/drink as we went along. We chose the second option since we weren't ONLY going to be eating at Mandalay, and she said no problem. 

So we get checked in, put our things away and get ready to eat at The Buffet. Time to pay and I tell them to charge our room credit. Turns out we ""have no credit,"" so I say ""call the front desk"". When we called, the girl was SO RUDE and insisted we pay $100\/day just to get $75 credit, literally raising her voice and trying to argue with me. I told her what the other lady had told us and she did not care; she was basically calling me a liar. I got her name, which unfortunately I can't remember but I think it was Nicole Carter or something similar. We ended up paying for our food, which wasn't that great either and I was already disappointed to begin with. 
After eating, we went to the front desk to see what was happening. We got help right away, and the lady apologized and seemed sympathetic. When I told her about the phone call with the other front desk lady, she said ""Yeah, I know her, she is really rude. I'm really sorry."" I laughed. 

She did tell us that we only had $75 credit and in order to use it we had to deposit $100 but that it'd be refunded if we didn't go over. (I guess she is the only one that knew what she was doing or what she was talking about.) So we deposited $100 and she gave us $100 credit to accommodate us.
That night, we tried to buy bottled water with our room credit and again we were told we had no room credit, in a rude manner. (They treat you like you're stealing when you try to use room credit!) We were annoyed that we had to call the front desk yet AGAIN just for water. We were on the phone for about 20 minutes trying to get things cleared up. Finally, we got our water. 
The next morning, I get a phone call from a staff member and she tells me that she's sorry for all the trouble that has been occurring with my room credit. I tell her how frustrating it is, and even though it was only $100, we were getting treated really poorly for no reason. She gave us 2 Shark Reef passes to accommodate. ""Just go to the aquarium and tell them you have two comp passes under your name,"" the lady said.
This made me feel better about Mandalay and I thought, ""Well maybe the staff isn't so bad after all.""
I was wrong. We get to Shark Reef Aquarium and guess what? ""THERE'S NO COMP. PASSES HERE UNDER YOUR NAME."" We had to wait another 30 minutes while this lady contacted the front desk. Sigh. In the end, we did get in though.

All and all, the stay was not good to say the least. Staff is NOT friendly, and they are very snobby. Sorry for being an inconvenience Mandalay staff!
During check out, they also tried to charge us for the Shark Reef tickets......I just thought, ""Here we go again."" Another 30 minutes wasted.

Located at the edge of the strip. The casino\/lobby is very nice and so are the rooms. The rooms are very comfortable and I was amazed at the little tub in the bathroom with a separate stand up shower. Loved the tub :P The bathroom and the room was very modern looking and clean.

EXCEPT. I have a habit of checking sheets, pillows and everything for dirtyness. I flipped over one of the main pillows and there were TONS of dark red spots... We immediately called the lobby and complained and all they did was give us a $50 dine in gift card. Better than nothing but my ex was disgusted and they could of least waived one night's fee. But nonetheless, we wanted to show them the pillow case but they never came up to inspect it. So we just left it on the floor and continued out day.

PROS::

1] Very very nice rooms
2] Very clean (Except for our pillow case) and comfortable
3] Great view if you get the correct side of the hotel

We left The Westgate the same day we checked in we didn't spend a single night there...and we had absolutely nowhere to go.  We decided to give The Mandalay Bay a shot and see if they had any rooms available.  Not only did they have a room for 2 nights available...they upgraded our room to an Executive Suite for next to nothing.  The staff have gone out of their way to make my birthday as enjoyable as they possibly could.  The room is gorgeous...I'm sitting in it as I type this review.  The rates were extremely reasonable and I can't wait to see what the morning holds.  I will DEFINITELY come back and stay here the next time I come to Vegas...and I HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a top-notch customer service experience.,0,0,0

Start out in a room with two queen beds, and immediately notice that the beds are no larger than full.  Switch to a one-king room, and only there do you get a lounger, plus a solo couch and ottoman.  Also, if you like the look of a frosted-glass partition by the bathtub, it can be had only at the 1-king, and not the 2-queen (probably for privacy reason).

The room needs cosmetic touch-up:  lots of chips and dents on the bedside furniture, dresser and mirror frames; rusty rings around faucets; stained shower floor.

A room with pool view also means seeing the airport runways and a heli-pad, and that comes with the sound of take-off and landing.",4,0,2

It takes a lot of irritation to overcome my normal laziness and force me to actually check out of one hotel and in to another.  Vdara reached that level with me, and instead of silently suffering, I'm happy to say I got off my rear and voted with my wallet and moved to Mandalay Bar.  

And I'm equally happy to say the experience here is like night and day.

Mandalay Bay's rooms are a little older, and slightly less-trendy than the newest hotels in City Center, but they are perfectly nice, spacious and well-appointed.

But the real difference comes in the form of the hotel staff.

Here at Mandalay, the hotel is staffed by adults; people who obviously have a few years of experience in the hospitality industry.  They are courteous and attentive.  If you ask for help for a problem, they do their best to solve it immediately.  They treat you with the basic level of respect that acknowledges you are indeed a paying customer, as opposed to someone lucky just to have been let past the velvet rope.

I've only been here a day, but every person from the concierge to the check-in staff to the bell desk personnel to the folks staffing the sundries shops are pleasant and courteous.  I'm not saying they are bending over being obsequious; I'm saying they meet or exceed that basic level of civility that makes you feel like the care whether you are happy and comfortable, and that they care whether or not you return again.

So, anyway...it's nice to know I wasn't having a hallucination elsewhere...and that good service and professional staff do indeed exist in Las Vegas.  And as is the case in most of the good hotels, they do a world-class job that is competitive with any place anywhere.

And no, I'm not a paid spammer for Mandalay Bay.  I'm just so thrilled, after my prior experience elsewhere, to find that good service in Las Vegas is still alive and well.",0,0,0

Even the regular rooms are very nice (four words: TV in the bathroom).  The bed was extremely comfortable.  Housekeeping was consistently prompt and courteous.  

I particularly enjoy the casino: spacious, very elegant and well-ventilated, with very good cocktail service more often than not.  They had a free late-night rock concert in one of the bars on the casino floor which we thought was great.  

Restaurant choices abound, though many are on the pricey side.  We always make it a point to visit the Burger Bar for food (reviewed separately) and Red Square for drinks (never actually tried their food).

I had to check out the pool if just briefly, to see what the fuss is about.  The pool area was beautiful as promised, but as with many properties, it's my understanding you have to arrive early in the morning to secure a lounge chair.  In Vegas, I'm never in a condition to get up before about 11 AM, so that's out of the question.

There were some minor detractions, but not enough to reduce the five star rating for me: 
- room walls are relatively thin and hallway noise is very audible; 
- front desk clerk last time was rather curt (her greeting, verbatim: ""What's your name? I need a form of payment.  The mini bar is on weight and time sensors, so if you move anything, you'll be charged for it."")  
- Check in procedure is annoying, because there is a separate line for each clerk and people are constantly jockeying to make sure they are in the best line.  Luxor does it more logically with a single line feeding into all stations.",0,0,0

I traveled to Las Vegas as a christmas present for my brother. He needed a vacation so I drove him. I have been pretty dissapointed with this stay. My 9 year old with autism traveled with us also.

The check in experience was very quick. We are paying that resort fee plus $55 and without all the hiccups would have been okay. The lady was nice.

I got some really nice customer service with Sery, Amanda and Mark.  I did get some eye rolling from other people also.

Once up in the room it looked okay. Things are worn and stained but for the money A-Okay.  Things were a little dirty on the surface of everything.

My son takes a shower and gets ready for bed. I pull back the covers and notice glitter and hair.  Someone forgot to change the sheets.  I also noticed as I pulled down the sheets hair smack in the middle of the bed --short hair -- I shiver to think what that is from.

It is approaching 8:30 pm and I would love to get my son in bed. I called they ordered all new bedding -- waited till 9:15 pm would love to get my son to bed -- walked down stairs suggested I change rooms and took off room for the night  plus tax. Changing rooms at 9:30 ish with a 9 year old with autism was challenging to say the least.

We change rooms get my son settled and go to get on the internet and that  did not work. Called help desk and they said someone needed to come up to the room to get the internet working.  5 minutes to 11pm so still awake hotel engineer reset the internet. Talked to from desk took off resort fee for one night. 10 minutes after 11 my son feel asleep,

Go to get my car in the morning from Valet stop to get gas and noticed two small dings on the side of my car with red paint on it. I have a new car -- I filed a report just for the process --

so management deems my two dings as worth a $25,00 credit and removal of the second resort fee -- as I was talking to manager re dents he offers to call shark reef to set it up so visit to santa in shark reef is painless I just have to go to shark reef will call and give them my name.

I made the trek with my son across to shark reef go the will call to discover they have no clue who I am -- we left disappointed.  
All these little things have let up to a huge disapointment -- I would spend my money elsewhere --

We were staying here because my friend works the fashion shows that are happening this week.  The rooms at Mandalay were huge, and the beds were comfy.  The pillows were terrible, but that's to be expected from hotels.  We had a good time exploring and visiting the shark tank, even though it was 18$ per person.

HOWEVER
On our way to leave the hotel on Sunday, we realized that our tired had been slashed in the Mandalay parking garage.  We notified security, who seemed unconcerned and told us to go back to our car and wait for someone.  The person who helped us was amazing and really helpful about what to do next.  We were not the only car whose tires got slashed.  The car 2 spaces from us did as well, and we heard that cars at the Luxor also experienced the same thing.  We called AAA, and then called tire stores frantically trying to find new tires on  a Sunday.  Luckily we finally found a place that had them, but we ended up having to pay 300$ for 2 new tires and wait 3.5-4 hours to sort out the ordeal.  The Mandalay has a camera on the garage, and it was very close to our car, so I""m a little surprised that they took no responsibility for what happened.  When I called the front desk to talk about it, I was told that we would have to wait for ""risk management"" to call us back.  We have yet to hear anything, and plan to call them today.  I find it really ridiculous that after staying here for 2 nights and spending tons of money on things at their casino, they still seem unconcerned that our car got vandalized.  There are lots of nice hotels in Vegas, and if I knew that Mandalay didn't care about its patron's property, I likely would have stayed elsewhere.

If risk management chooses to do the right thing and cover some of our expenses, I will happily amend this review, because the rest of our experience was really positive.  But overall its just not worth the stress and money of having your property vandalized.",2,0,0

Brings back a lot of nice memories from back in the day.  Every time I walk back in, the smell reminds me of all the good times I've had at this resort.

From the pool (which is one of the best in Vegas), to the many awesome restaurants, (strip steak, Lupo, Burger Bar) you can't go wrong with any of them and that is to just name a few.

For the 21 and older crowd, Morea Beach is the topless optional pool and always a great time in the summer!  Especially if you want to get away from all the kids in the big pool.

The whole layout is huge and you better be ready to walk.  Things can be very spread out at this hotel!  The Michael Jackson show currently at Mandalay Bay is awesome, and I recommend it.  I've also seen the Lion King, and Mama Mia, when I've had family in town!  Great Venue!

We went to the pool, I had friends rent out rooms for birthday parties, and we loved to visit Shark Reef. This was one of my favorite hotels, but recently the more I visit it, the worse my experiences seem to be.

Their *new* parking situation is absolute chaos. It was already hectic trying to get in their parking garage, but now that it's paid parking it's just a nightmare. 

I recently visited last Saturday night, and it seemed as though the hotel scheduled at least three different concerts on one night. I wasn't aware of this, and was blindsided when I got to the parking garage and saw employees directing the flow of cars away from the parking garage, and down a side street to Frank Sinatra Blvd. without offering an explanation as to why. (One guy just came up to my car and pointed down the street, and when I told him I couldn't get across because other cars were flying by me, he just kept pointing and yelling.) So, when I reached the entrance on the other side of the building, you can imagine my surprise when they wouldn't let us enter there either. The left hand turn lane wasn't blocked off, so people were making partial turns and then getting stopped in the middle of the road by employees and obstructing traffic. It was so, so dangerous.

Was the parking garage full, on fire, or about to crumble to the ground? I'll never know, because the employees were screaming at cars to ""just leave"" instead of telling us what was happening. (There wasn't even a sign that said ""garage full"" anywhere that I could see, instead it just said ""SELF PARKING - FEES,"" or something like that.) I made a u-turn in the middle of the street, and I ended up parking at Luxor's parking garage - which I imagine a lot of other people did, too - and paid them $5 for the three hours I spent there. At this point I had been driving around for at least 30 minutes having multiple panic attacks as I was redirected every which way down Frank Sinatra Blvd. This parking situation really, really makes me not want to visit Mandalay Bay anymore because it just seems so chaotic. I might check it out in a few months - years? - when, and if, they work out the kinks in the parking system.

TL;DR Parking is a pain in the butt, and the employees don't seem to have the patience to deal with the changes. Even once I was inside I wasn't impressed with the hotel like I normally am, and would've rather spent my time somewhere else.",3,3,1

This is an MGM owned property and if you enjoy the Bellagio, you'll probably enjoy the Bay. The property is fairly run down and to put this in perspective, it's like sleeping in a smoky version of a Southwest jet. 

Here's a small tidbit of how customer service went: I checked in and was sent to the 11th floor. I call the front desk to verify I was put into a non-smoking room, they assure me it is and they'll have housekeeping put in an ""ozone machine"". The bellman brings my bag after 5-10 minutes. Inquiring as to whether I'm really on a non-smoking floor, the bellman says, ""there's only 2 smoking floors and you are just above one of these"". 

I need to leave, so I tip the guy, unpack and get out of the terrible room. 5 hours later I pop back in for a quick change. It smells the same, so I call the front desk. They ask me if the ozone machine was put in, and I have no way of knowing, but it smells the same. The x'fer me the Tina, the asst head of operations. (Tina should not be in customer service, perhaps the coroner's office is a better fit.) Anyhow, Tina says the hotel is full and basically ""better luck next time"" and she commits to get the ozone machine up. 5 hours later, I pop back in and the air is better, but the room is still old and gross. I try the front desk once more, but they say they are full and can't move me. Whateva'---I can resolve by not staying here. Back to the review:

The grounds look nice and the pools and wave pool looked like fun. The resort fee is a ""tacky ask"" and there are literally no overhead lighting in the sad, dark rooms. I guess they are trying to depress you into dropping coin in their dark, shabby casino.

If the hotel is crowded, (it was supposedly full on this trip), they aren't quite handling the capacity of tourists. People literally waited 10-15 minutes on elevators through the main elevator zone. The cab line was 20-30 minutes. The elevator piece has to be against code, but fortunately earthquakes in Vegas are rare. (It was an MGM which burned many years, ago).

The check-in\/check-out experience was better than the Bellagio, but it is really a generous stretch to call this a 2 star hotel.

Tonight, as I wrote this review a pop-up occurred advertising the Mandalay @ $89\/night. That's really cheap and given the fantastic view of the airport runways, probably a reasonable price.",3,0,0

The only thing that brought this trip down a big notch was the rowdy, loud, drunk group of people in the room next to us on our last night. We turned in around 1 am to be awoken around 230 by a loud drunk screaming laughing girl and several others. Finally around 330 we called security to have a chat with them. 

Even after security asked them to quiet down (and i think kicked out one person) they left and came back still drunker and louder after 5 am.

I wasn't staying at this hotel because it costs to much, so I walked there from NYNY. When I got there I stopped in a convenience shoppe to get a bottle of water. The lines were very long, as other concert goers had arrived and there were two registers working. As soon as I got up to the counter the employee didn't say a word, but immediately closed her register and walked away without warning. This left one cashier to manage a line of about 30. 

Next, we got to the Event Center and the crowd had grown considerably. This venue holds about 12K people, and once through security we were ushered into lines for ticket entry. The band protects themselves against scalping by requiring you to swipe the credit card you used to purchase your tickets in order to get your ticket for entry and seating. Once at the front of that line, I handed the worker my credit card and she refused to take it, telling me I was in the wrong line. I was then ushered into another line that was terribly long. I stood in that line for about 20 minutes until a staff member made an announcement that the line I was in was for people that had issues with their cards only, and that everyone else was to use the other lines (that I was already turned away from). I finally made it to the front again and was finally admitted inside. 

The employees that worked the concessions were very rude. The band required all beverages to be removed from bottles and cans and poured into plastic cups. They were cups designed for draft beer and had no lids. In order to get a lid I had to purchase a Pepsi cup for the fountain drinks, but I was charged for a bottle of water AND a fountain drink to get the cup. $10 later I finally had water. 

This venue was extremely disorganized and inefficient. It is my belief that the nasty attitudes that we endured from hotel and venue staff were discriminatory in nature. This was a heavy metal rock concert venue. Everyone was dressed according to the genre of music the band plays. I believe that the staff saw the crowd as being a class of people that were beneath them, therefore they treated us accordingly. The average age group of this even was 40+. This is a band that was popular in the early 80s, so its fan base is an older crowd. Many are even grandparents, and are professionals with educations and careers. Wearing leather and concert t-shirts certainly does not turn a 45 year old construction manager into a teenaged delinquent by any means, nor does it turned the highly educated college professor into a trashy groupie either. But that's how everyone was treated. 

Overall, the show itself was great. The support staff surrounding it just sucked. I recommend staying somewhere else, and I'm going to post on the Iron Maiden Fan Club blog and recommend they never play here again.",5,4,4

The rooms are spacious with double sinks and a glass shower and large tub.

Like others, I've found that the wait for the elevators is ridiculous. It seemed as though only 1 goes up at a time and that is not good for a hotel that big.

I waited only 10 minutes in line, but once I got to the clerk, it was an over 45 minute ordeal.  not only that, they lied to me.  Then they charged me rates that were higher than what I was supposed to get.  To their credit they fixed it AFTER I brought it to their attention.  Otherwise, I would have paid so much more money.

Everything was such a horrible ordeal.  I can't believe I've given this place thousands of dollars of my business and my company's business in the past.  After the horrible experience on my last visit there, I will never recommend this place to any other place.

Outside of that experience, this hotel is at the very south end of the strip.  In my opinion, as well as my friends and family, all the action and excitement that we're looking for is too far away from this location.  The center strip is a much better location for us.  This is way too far for us.

-the elevators: everyone here is telling the truth. The elevators are slow and packed. it's like they only have one working. the wait is maybe about 5 minutes. it's not too bad but you can anticipate being crammed with ppl and floaty tubes almost every trip up and down from your room. 

-the line to check in is RIDICULOUSLY long. they have convenient check out procedures to prevent you from going through that line twice HOWEVER, the convenient check out (express through drop box, text, through video) doesn't give you a receipt. i'm still waiting on the charges to post, hopefully they're not crazy. Also something that I wanted to note was that while we checked in the person helping us told us that she had been working til 1am and was back at 10am working. she couldn't find our reservation bc she was on the wrong day... gah. when you check in you may get your keys but not your room number. they will call you to let you know your room number once your room is ready. 

-beach area is flooded with people but still enjoyable. if you're coming with your family you  may want to rent a cabana bc it's pretty hard to find a chair let alone a bunch all in a row. 

-there's a tram that connects mandalay to luxor and excalibur, save your feet!!!!!!!!!!!!! 


those are the things that stand out to me. aside from all of that the room was very spacious. OH, room service only came ONCE out of the 4 days i was there. we didn't put a sign on the door so WTF. oh well. not a bad spot to stay at. the casino itself is clean and appealing. it is all the way at the end of the strip though (also an older crowd for nightlife) so you can guarantee you'll need a taxi if you want to get to more jumpin parties and things.

I can't think of anything else. The room rates seem to be too high to justify staying here again since you can pay about the same and stay in the Center Strip at either Bellagio\/Aria for just a little more (or in my case, sometimes less at Aria).

We checked in on a late Sunday evening.  Hubby and I waited in line for about 20 mins before we were seen.  Check in was effortless and we were soon given a room on the 8th floor.  We could see the In-And-Out burger from our room (Not so much of a good view from where we were but ok nontheless.)

Room:  Clean and very large.  We booked the spa suite and the bathroom was huge with a very large spa tub (jet tub, hot tub, whatever you wish to call it).  There was also a separate shower for our use.  Did not like how if you first walk into the room you can see into the bathroom.  Not good for the housekeeper who walks in unexpectedly.  Bathroom included television (was never used).  Room included a flat screen tv also with a few channels, not the greatest cable channels.  But hey, we weren't really in our room all that much anyways.

Ammenities:  We used the cardio room once or twice during our stay.  It is not really a big room however there are plenty of cardio machines.  The room did start to fill up after a while.  For an extra fee if I'm not mistaken you can work out in their weight room.  Casino smelled not of cigarettes but of a different scent.  I could not pinpoint it exactly, but it was a welcome feeling being able to sit at the slots and not have to inhale the God awful stench of cigar smoke.  Slot machines are well...slot machines.  You win some, you lose some.  Room service was pricey but worth it (when I was too hungover to walk to a restaurant but needed food lol).  It was about a 45-60 min wait for the food to be delivered to your room. 

Restaurants:  Only ate at the house of blues for breakfast, Aureole for our anniversary dinner and Citizens for lunch. Please see my separate review on those experiences...HOB  wasn't a very good one the second time around.  However the management has addressed the issue I am happy to report so all is well.

Overall:  Overall the hotel is nice.  I do hate that a bottle of water is $3, and we were told if you move the items in the mini bar or the convenience stand you will be charged.  This is because it uses a weight sensor to charge you for those items.  The prices were ridiculous for those services.  Yes they were convenient but no way I would be over $5 for a bag of m&m's or cookies.  We used the express check out and just dropped a card in the box and was told a bill would be emailed to us.  That was very convenient considering how long the line was for check out that day.  We unfortunately did not see any of the shows hosted at the Mandalay Bay.  It was very convenient the hotel linked to nearby hotels, and there is a monorail that will take you between the Mandalay, Luxor and Excalibur (which came in handy.  I recommend this hotel to a friend and hopefully in the future I can see myself staying at this hotel again.",4,0,2

The room was a delight as well. I'm a fan of beds that resemble that of cloud-like sensation. Our view over looking the strip was fun to watch sunrise and sunset, the atmosphere all around the hotel was that of mid-twenties and above, so  it was great to not feel like you were in a constant frat house.... just a more ""adult"" setting for crazy drunken chaos.... ha ha ha.

We kindly asked for someone to open it and it took around an hour or hour and a half to get someone to come up and open the door after I had to call 2 more times. When they did come, they wouldn't open the door without seeing my wife and her ID. Apparently there is a huge problem with guests stealing other peoples flat
irons at Mandalay Bay. So I now had to wake my wife up bc we had already been waiting for over an hour. We went to put some bottles of water that we had into the fridge in the now 3rd room and found the fridge is packed full with no room for anything else and this fridge happens to be broken. But we were to tired and frustrated to even deal with it. So, our first 3 hours and 3 rooms here haven't been very good.

(if available) We were told by the clerk that there might be ""like a $30 upgrade charge"". We loved the suite. We had another great experience at Aureole. The bartender, food and ambiance there was great as usual.

 On Sunday, we tried to checkout using the TV, but it was having issues. We went downstairs to the front desk to checkout and was greeted with a charge 10 times more than the what was quoted to us originally. The manager Takeshi said the most he could do was to discount the first night 50% since we had already used the room. I asked him to contact the original clerk to verify the price he quoted. Well sure enough he was unable to be reached. Takeshi said he would be in for his shift at 5pm and ask him then. Great, we drive home not knowing how much we are going to be charged. That was a miserable 4 hours debating when to call Mandalay or the creditcard and dispute the charges.

 When we get home and check my e-mail I see the corrected charges on a receipt from Mandalay sent 15 minutes after we left.  I'm thinkin'  a call would have made the drive home a lot more pleasant. We gave you a contact number before we left. 

 On Monday my wife called to remind them the tips for the spa were not on the corrected receipt.. She wanted to make sure the spa staff got their tips. i checked the credit card charges, I see 2 pending charges. They have not only the overcharged comped room, but the corrected charges pending also. Never got a call back from Takeshi. Thanks for making us follow up on your mistake. 

 After a call to the credit card co. it looks to be straightened out finally. 

TLDR: Free Suite\/ then $30 Suite\/ then 10x more\/ then double charge\/ finally $30\/ still no call from manager. Make sure you get a quote in writing for an upgrade or they make you pay 10x more.

Cons: The separate toilet area makes you feel claustrophobic, the lighting in the room was poor (not enough of them), and the TV in the restroom did not receive external channels.

Financials: The extra $25\/day resort fee for free wi-fi and access to the gym does not give you your money's worth.

Summary: It is too far from the things on the strip. I recommend staying no further down than the MGM to save time and swollen feet or paying a little more to be in or near the City Center properties. However, its great if you want quiet away from the action and to swim in your bathtub like I did.

Well, we love that the lobby (impossibly high ceilings; calm, gleaming with marble; and housing a large aquarium), and the other public areas really do make this seem more like an actual resort hotel than just a Vegas version of one. You don't have to walk through the casino to get to any of these public areas or the guest-room elevators, the pool area is spiffy, and the entire complex is marginally less confusing and certainly less overwhelming than some of the neighboring behemoths.
The spacious rooms may not seem as luxe when compared to newer options at places like Aria or The Cosmopolitan but they are still lovely. They are all sleek modernity, like everyone else in town, but the furnishings are cozy (love the window seats) and the fixtures fine. The bathrooms are downright large with impressive, slightly sunken tubs, glassed-in showers, double sinks, and separate water closets, plus lots of fab amenities. Rooms on higher floors have some of the best Strip views in town, but usually cost an additional fee.
There are no fewer than four pools, including the touted wave pool, which is, unfortunately, a classic example of Vegas bait-and-switch. It can't handle waves of any serious size, but bobbing in the miniwaves is delightful, as is floating happily in the lazy river (tubes are available for rental -- we say save some bucks and share a tube with friends). Though it was already the finest pool area in town, recent overhauls have given it even more style, adding in a poolside casino, restaurant, and bar. All in all, this area alone makes this resort a top choice for families. The downside of creating such an alluring pool package is that it lures lots and lots of people to its sandy shores -- so many that at times it becomes more of a pain than a pleasure. If a quiet poolside retreat is what you are looking for, you may want to go elsewhere. A well-equipped workout facility, full-service spa, and a salon complete the recreation package.",2,2,2

LUPO - Never been here, looks appealing.

Parking - It's not just here, it is all the ""M"" hotels.  Charging for parking 60 min or longer, so beware if you are visiting.  I can assume this will be adopted by every hotel soon.

I bought a package for EDC that included a hotel stay at the Mandala Bay. I have never been to Vegas so me and my friends decided getting a package was easier. 


Upon arrival we were NOT asked to be helped with Luggage while the bell people watched me walk with a handful of bags. We walked to the front desk just to be told "" oh you got a SMALL package. You have to check in over there."" A small package? We paid 1,800 after tax. NOT to mention we were NOT aware of the ""resort fee"" So we got surprised with paying almost 300.00 dollars at check-in. Because self parking was 13.00 dollars a day. Why do they not offer free parking for there guest??


I thought we were going to have a amazing experience upon arrival but it was such a disappointment. The First Lady was a bit rude. But the lady who checked us in was even ruder. I would think for such a HIGHLY rated hotel they should have friendly staff. They looked at us like if we ""didn't belong"" made us feel very uncomfortable.


We decided to stay 1 more night and went down stairs to the front desk to see if we can book another room. The LADY who attended us looked our room up. STARED at the computer hitting her lip and looked us up and down like all the other staff. Then she said ""mmmmm we don't have any double queen size bed rooms available. You would have to book a room with a King sized bed.... BUT there's non available either."" So I Asked the Lady "" there's absolutely NO rooms available?"" She said. ""Mmmmm no sorry. At that point I KNEW she was lying and I was very upset. I immediately went up to my room and decided to CALL mandala bay booking services. I asked if there was availability for TODAY JUNE 19. The lady said there is PLENTY of rooms available. I told her not even 10 min ago were we told that there was NO AVAILABILITY.  


I was so upset. I called the front desk and asked to speak to a MANAGER. I told the lady the situation over the phone and she told me she would have a ""talk"" with that employee. She doesn't understand were we had a miscommunication. I told her There was NO miscommunication she KNEW exactly what she was doing. She offered to give us a room for 75 plus resort fees. I told her that was ridiculous especially since we have been treated very POORLY since arrival. She then offered to give us the SAME room for $50.00 flat. And she waived the ""RESORT FEE"".

Originally when I booked on expedia.com, I thought I was booking a room in the actual Mandalay Bay.  I upgraded to a suite, which sent me to the attached Delano Hotel.  I was completely unaware this was a separate hotel until after I checked in.  (see my review for Delano hotel)  I checked into Mandalay Bay, but was told I had a suite in the Delano hotel which is connected, but apparently a separate hotel. Michael (Matthew?) assisted me anyway, and I was on my way!  Since the Delano side has no gaming, I parked myself in Mandalay bay for the weekend to gamble myself silly.

Gaming:
Hands down, this was the best gaming experience I've ever had. I only played craps and slots, but I was rated extremely well at the tables.
At the craps table, John, Paul, Bobby, Xia, and Andrew the pit boss made it a great weekend, and it's because of them that I'll be back to continue my gambling habit at this establishment. The drink service on the floor was also great, even at the penny slots. I usually stick with beer when getting my free drinks, but the mixed drinks were made extremely well.

Pool: It was the 4th of July weekend so it was completely insane and not really worth the walk from Delano.  Mandalay Bay has real imported sand.  They scan your card, so pool hopping with old key cards won't work.  Also, each adult must have their own working card.  (Hint, hint: Don't downplay the number of people in your room... I'm not sure if ""losing"" your key would work, since they may reset and reissue all the keycards.)

It's pretty far from the center of the strip, and if you're going to take a taxi it'll cost you about 8-12 bucks. Some drivers will take you on a roundabout trip to squeeze a few extra bucks out of the trip. (If you get the guy in the cowboy hat that starts babbling about juggling on America's Got Talent, go to the next cab)

Mandalay Bay has followed the other casinos and is now charging for parking, and no, Nevada license will not get you in free here like some of the other casinos. Grab a ticket, but tell the front desk you parked on the lot when you check in. They will give you a flat $12 rate to enter\/leave as often as you like AND park at the other MGM locations until 11:59AM check out day. Just use your room key the rest of the stay at the garage! (ALSO don't forget to keep one of your room keys when you check out to get out of parking!!!!!!) 
The rooms were simple and included a bath tub. There is a refrigerator, but it is filled and has a sensor so don't move anything or you will get charged! You can ask for a refrigerator if you have medications that need to be kept cool and they can accommodate for that. 
There is quite a bit of walking to get from the parking garage, to the front desk. Front desk and elevators to the room are fairly close. Plan ahead if you have trouble walking! 
There is a ""food court"" with restaurants, not fast food near the convention center and a few restaurants in the Mandalay bay shoppes (this shopping area is DEAD). The casino seems to have slowed down a lot in the last couple of years. You'll more than likely want to travel to the other casinos if you're looking for good food!  If you're looking for a more hip, popping crowd\/place avoid staying. If you're looking for a place to relax, smaller crowd this will be perfect. 
The pool is one of their main attractions. It's geared more for children. Lots of splashing and yelling. If you want a more quiet, adult- atmosphere head to a different casino.

They offer a mobile\/online check in prior to arriving.  After you enter all of your information and credit card, you have to wait to receive an email with your room number. Once you get that email and arrive, there's a separate, very short line for those who checked in online. Well unfortunately, we arrive at the hotel before I got the email and was told to wait in line as the safest bet. We waited in line for a good 30 minutes and shy of 5 people, I finally get the email with our room number.  Aside from that glitch, we were impressed at how friendly and accommodating the staff was. You can always tell a well run hotel when everyone from the valet to the concierge, housekeeping and casino staff are welcoming and friendly. That's not an easy management goal to maintain when you're a really big hotel like Mandalay. I forgot my wine opener at home, called the concierge and they sent someone to my room in 10 minutes, that was impressive.
 
We brought our own floaties, I bought a pink swan and a white swan at Target for $20 and it was so worth it, they were a hit! Such a hit, an elder European lady and her daughter tried to steal ours! The nerve! Don't worry, I confronted her and snatched it back!
 
Our room was very modern, spacious with two large closets, and the beds were very comfy. The bathroom was nice and big with a separate shower and tub. The kids loved bathing in there.  Please note: If you are travelling with kids, make sure you bring a cooler with water, drinks, snacks before you leave because the prices are their own financial hemorrhage. I paid $22 for a Mike's hard lemonade and a modelo. Woof.

They are like 4.75 :)  I really like it, but sometimes I think they need a few more luxuries to bump them to that 5.  At any rate, they seriously rock, I am just being a picky yelper when it comes to 5 star reviews.  

I have actually stayed at Mandalay twice.  Once in one of the spa suites this past weekend and once in their regular room a couple years ago.  What both had in common was a beautifully designed room.  Classic, but not over the top.  Great bathrooms (spa suite has a jacuzzi tub for two!), comfy beds and nice flat screen TVs.  

The spa suite was awesome since it was at the end of the hall so we had a quiet room with few neighbors.  The regular room I stayed in before had paper thin walls and you could hear everything!  If we come back (and we will) we will upgrade!  The only thing the suite was missing was robes.  It seems like other Vegas hotels provide robes at that level of service, but maybe I am being picky ;) 

I also really like the shops and restaurants in Mandalay Place (linking Mandalay and Luxor).  So this is a bonus since you can walk in and find everything you need!  Oh, and visit the spa for a real treat.  I have gone on several occasions and find it one of the nicer more relaxing spas on the strip!

The room itself was pretty big the bath had separate tub and shower it even had a tv and phone in there! Talk about fancy lol. The price of the room was pretty reasonable for being Valentines Day and a Saturday.  Everything was very clean and beautiful down the the detailing on the ceiling. The bathrooms towels were fresh and soft. Ive always wanted to stay here and am so glad i did this will definitely be my first choice when i come back to Vegas. I also loved there express check out its fast and convenient!,0,0,0

I had to choose between a 3 and 4, so I decided 4 because of the smell and general atmosphere.  It did not seem as scummy as some hotels I have seen on the strip.

Although our room was really nice as far as decor and comfort goes, the walls are paper thin which emanate constant weird noises (not sure if it the elevators squeaking or the water pipes).  Not cool!   Also, check-in is horrible and way understaffed.  We had about a 45 minute wait to check-in on a weekday at 3:30pm.

The worst part of this hotel is probably more due to the greedy nature of the MGM-Mirage company and their nickel and dime pricing structure.  What is especially ludicrous is that in addition to paying a steep $35 per night resort fee, it doesn't include a $10 per night parking fee.  Self-Parking should be free for guests staying at the hotel, so this just seems like another way to gouge the customer.  They have an in-room coffee machine, but there is a sealed disposable cup with the grounds in it that'll cost $4.50 if you use it.  All in all, it was very easy to rack up over $150 in fees for two rooms for two nights.  

This is a fairly nice hotel that feels more and more overpriced the longer you stay. For me, the parking BS really pushed things over the edge to the point that I don't want to return.",0,0,0

I recommend the room.  It's a complete drag at 6 AM when you're about as far South on the Strip as you can get and then you have to make the long walk of shame to the very end of the hallway depending on what floor you're on (these suites are the last door down the corridor\/dead center), but the room is expansive and really nice if you and two of your former college slobs want to set up camp inside one area.  Security was even nice enough to escort one of the slobs back to the room twice in a 24 hour span as he completely went down the wrong wing and beat the hell out of the door of some poor, unsuspecting hotel guest(s).

No penalty or slap on the wrist for his stupidity (I was very concerned as I spoke with them as I opened the door to this 1400 square foot palace), just the look in the eyes of all four security guards pleading for me to hog-tie him.

Anywho, two bedrooms.  One has two queen beds.  Both have expansive bathrooms with jet tubs if you're into soaking in suds.  One fridge stocked (which stunk because Andy McDrunky took a 16 ounce bottle of Pierre Lucroix Chablis and drank it...$27).  One fridge unstocked.  A CD stereo in the main quarters (bring an auxiliary cable to connect your ipod and you'll be fine.  I listened to the main theme from 'My Bodyguard' by Dave Grusin a dozen times).

I give this 3 out of 5 stars because I found two things inconceivable in this day and age.

1)  When you drop X amount of dollars on a room (in this case, X denotes a grand over two nights), you should be able to check in at 2 PM.  

I arrived at McCarran at 8:30 AM and even though the city monitors knew that I was going to be sinking their little jewel even further into recession, I waited to check in at a reasonable time.  When the trainee at the registration desk told me the room was ready but unavailable for two hours, I had steam spouting out of my ears.  I nearly went Lee Van Cleef on all of the beige coats, there.

I didn't make a scene.  I was calm, cool, collected despite being absolutely lit to the gills...but it's honestly unacceptable to drop that amount of USD on a room and not have it available in the afternoon.

2)  Not necessarily directed at the Mandalay Bay, but MGM resorts, in general.  It's flat out RIDICULOUS that their MLife Rewards Program doesn't give you an ounce of credit when you step up to the Sportsbook window, confidence seeping out of your pores and throw down a couple grand in wagers.  Say whah??  Whah happened?

You sit your conservative tooshy down at a $5 Blackjack table and give the dealer $50 for chips and they'll take your goofy little Rewards card.  You play like a man at the window, bettin' the Kent State Golden Flashes gettin' 14 @ Rutgers and they won't take it...even if you bet a measly $50, let alone a couple grand.  What the hell is that??

I should get the prettiest little Asian Pacific shorty the resort employs to come upstairs and drink some Jorge LaCroix Chablisand listen to a little dave Grusin with me for that kind of coin, but they just won't do it.

Don't think I can stay at an MGM Resort again due to these ridiculous policies.",2,2,0

These are all minor details, but at $400 a night at a pretty highly regarded hotel, you would expect more, right?

Hotel rooms are the same as they were 5 years ago.  Their furniture is scratched and worn.  Their TVS are complete dinosaurs.  Very old and hardly work half the time.  Their movies for purchase don't even work!  They have on demand but it's fuzzy and static-ey ALL the time.  I am constantly having to get a refund because their movies are terrible quality.  $15.99 for a blurry movie?  I don't THINK so!  You are telling me that after so many complaints you can't at least fix that ONE issue?  Is this hotel really that hard up?

Their room service is even worse.  They take about an hour and 15 minutes to get to the room and then the food arrives cold and tasteless, yet they charge an enormous amount.

Their beach area is the nicest thing about Mandalay.  It's fun, hip and the concerts are great.

I just really don't like staying in their rooms but we stay here because we are noir members and get free accommodations.  Since MGM falls under the same company we should try that hotel next time.

The worst part of this hotel is the gaming!  Terrible slots that I never win on.  I have to go to other hotels to win.  Why do I even bother with this hotel?!?

We stayed here on a weekend earlier this month and I swear...the elevator lines were loooooong! We had to figure out a plan and we decided on going down to go up if that makes sense? It worked and got us up to our room faster. 

Their pool is totally awesome! We got a cabana for $400...but we had a deal with the room $100 off so it was only $300, but it was more than worth it! Everyone who didn't have a cabana looked pissed off and unhappy. It was in the lazy river area and it was nice! It had sodas and water, a tv, sofa, table, chairs, lounge chairs. The only thing that sucked was it said the cabana came with an ipod dock and when we got the cabana the host said they had a limited amount and they were taken for the day...we were like wtf?! She brought us an ipod dock at like 4pm...geee thanks! lol

We chose Mandalay Bay after reading reviews of their pools because we have two kids and thought it would be a nice treat after several days of hiking in the summer heat. I've never been to Las Vegas but after an early evening walk down the Strip to see the Bellagio fountain show, we'd had enough. We just wanted to stay at the hotel and relax. Unfortunately, the pools close at 7 pm so we had to wait until the following day to swim even though the temperature was well into the 90s until late in evening. Next day, we headed to the pools as soon as they opened. By mid-morning it was easily 100 degrees and the lazy river was so packed with people in tubes that it looked like a giant bowl of cheerios. The wave pool was almost as crowded. Despite the heat, there are almost no shady areas unless you pay some ridiculous fee to rent a cabana. In addition, the lines for check-in and the shark aquarium were long and slow. Definitely not how you want to spend your vacation.

It rained all weekend so I was unable to try the pool - which leads partially why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5. Resort fees... for what? We couldn't use the pool so we paid $67 for the illusion of a pool? Irritating.

Finally, housekeeping really irked me. We forgot to put the ""do not disturb"" sign up but regardless housekeeping knocked at 7AM and again at 8AM. AGAIN at 10AM and AGAIN at 11AM. The 10 and 11 one's weren't so bad - but seriously? 7 in the morning on a Saturday in VEGAS? Not sure if this is housekeeping's issue but we requested the mini bar be emptied and the snacks removed the day we arrived. They didn't do it until the day after.

Unfortunately,  I haven't enjoyed myself today at all due to exhaustion from not sleeping. Now that does not make me happy that I have to pay for anything. We reserved 2 rooms back in November for this trip. I never received any notification that it is now $18 per day to valet our car, on top of all other fees. Our 2 day trip will cost over $1000.

The staff at check-in and concierge were fantastic and very helpful, and our room was spacious and nicely decorated. 

The overall experience, however, was mixed.

Unfortunately, we found the house keeping standards to be low, and our experience with the cleanliness of the room were not positive. One of the towels left for us had large stains all over it, and upon close inspection there were small blood stains that were not washed off on the inside of the shower glass from the previous occupant. In hindsight we probably should have complained, but not wanting to cause a fuss we remained silent on the matter thinking to be simply a case of bad luck. 

Over the next couple of days other towels seemed to have minor stains on them and were pretty rough. This probably reflects the age of the towels being used but was still a little disappointing overall. In addition, one of the nights we also found stains on the sheets as well. This led to the nightly tradition of checking all towels before we took showers.

Another fault we found with the hotel was that the walls between rooms felt a little thin. We were woken up by our neighbors in the mornings and practically able to hear every word that was being said. This was frustrating at 8am when we were trying to relax and enjoy our vacation, and all we could hear was cursing and loud voices.

Mandalay Bay, like all of Vegas' hotels, allows smoking  which can be a little bit of a shock if you come from a more clean, non-smoking environment like we do. In the state I am from smoking is not permitted indoors or within 20 feet of a building, so that came as a surprise to me. The air freshener scent used to cover up the smell of smoke wasn't the best smell either. We left Vegas with a bit of a cough and left a lot of blood on our tissues when needing to blow our noses. We understand this is not just a Mandalay Bay thing but it does impact on ones ability to enjoy the Vegas experience. This being said, we are the minority when it comes to this topic and it in no way affected our rating, it is just a note to those who are new to Sin City like we were.

Mandalay Bay also features a classy looking bar and lounge located on the top floor of one of the hotels you can usually get free admission into, but be prepared to pay a bit for drinks (around $11 for basic spirits). This club also comes with a wonderful view of the strip and an outdoor viewing deck, but don't expect to go enjoy the view or get a few pictures, this area is roped off for private parties along with the majority of the seating. You are left to lean against a wall with your $11 drink and watch the private party enjoy themselves. 

Because we got our reservations online Mandalay included a $75 gift card to the Crystal shops. All these stores are designer and carry nothing for $75. That being said, it also included the Starbucks (Also more expensive) bus this was able to buy us coffee, snacks and breakfast for the entirety of our stay. It is cool they included Starbucks, because otherwise we would not have used the card, and it saved us money. This kindness was highly appreciated. 

Lastly, The pool, which Mandalay is known for.... IS CLOSED IN WINTER. I understand that this is to save some money, and many people would not use it. However the pool was one of the main reasons I picked the hotel. They did not inform us of the closure until we checked in. Coming from a cold location, Vegas is not that cold to me and I would have liked to enjoy the beach pool.


Located at the bottom of the strip, Mandalay Bay can sometimes feel a little far away from other hotels and attractions, but the free monorail service between Luxor and Excalibur was a useful and convenient service. Overall however, we found better attractions that suited us at other hotels, and the disappointing house keeping standards left us a little underwhelmed with what appears from the outside to be a beautiful looking hotel.",1,0,0

On a purely business front, this is a great convention hotel.  Very convenient.  Lots of good restaurants to eat with coworkers or clients at.  Upscale without being over-the-top.  And in general being a pretty enjoyable place.  Beware though, that depending on which meeting rooms you are in, it may be as much as a 20 minute walk to go from your room to your meeting.  After walking through the casino, past almost all of their restaurants, some of their shops, etc. you finally get to the conference side of the building.  The closer section of meeting space isn't too far, but if you're on the far side it is definitely a schlep!

On the leisure side of things, the hotel can be a little stuffy for a purely fun vacation.  The rooms are very corporate (although I've got to give them props for a great bathroom - great showers and seperate tubs), the hallways just go on and on, and although it does have shops and clubs, they're not quite as Vegas glitzy as other hotels.  (Which can be a good thing or bad thing depending on how you feel about glitz!)

I've only been here during the winter months, so can't comment too much on the pool areas.  They look awesome, and I could definitely see wanting to lay out on their pool deck and enjoy the sun, sand, wave pool and lazy river!  Maybe someday I'll make it back during warmer months and actually have time to lay out.

I'd definitely recommend Mandalay to business travelers who have the budget for it.  It can be a little pricier than some of the alternatives in town, but a great property for business.  I'd also recommend it for families who have kids who would love the pool area during the warmer months.  There's also a cool looking aquarium that I think the kids would enjoy.

Rooms: are very clean, in great condition and very quiet to sleep in and have a very restful night.
Beds are very comfortable, and clean. 
Showers, clean and great water pressure. 

Room Service: They keep it clean and nothing was missing. The only issue was that on my stay they didn't replace the towels and when we asked for some towels and supplies, they would take 15-30min to arrive (not that cool). Waiting for them when I want to go out right away... 

Wi-fi is horrible, and very unstable... good luck be ready to use ur own phone data.

Valet parking: omg... it took almost 50min to 1hr to get through the Valet parking. 1 single line for the parking.. horrible experience.., once you get in.. can't get out..  (you are stuck) stay away.. and self park!! (free parking if you are a customer, using the room key)

Beach pool: SOOOO CROWDED, tons of kids playing around. The lifeguards are high school kids? Some of them are really rude and disrespectful... So Hit or miss with who you talk to..

The room was lovely and spacious. Then the realization that there were only two bath towels, two hand towels and two wash cloths. Hotel size which is 2\/3 the size of a normal towel. We are in Vegas, it is hot, sticky and dirty. A shower in the evening before going out results in having to use a damp and grimy towel the next morning.

The biggest irritation was that we booked this hotel because of the great pool, wave pool and lazy river. Still can't find on their website the very important notification that you have to pay to use the bigger pool, the wave pool and the lazy river. The lazy river does not have an admission fee, instead they sell you a tube for $25. I live in the desert, what am I going to do with a large $25 tube? 

Okay so I have paid a $35 resort fee plus $10 parking fee each day and you can't let me swim for free? For the two of us you are looking at up to $155 per day in fees in addition to the room charge.",4,0,0

I asked whether or not we can pick our own seats, she replied, "" i dont' know ma'am, I do not have that information."" and then she raised her voice ""ma'am, you would need to maker your reservation first, then we will know.""

Loved that wi-fi was free and we had as many access ports as we need (I run a Mac with a VM which have separate IP addresses).

I stayed in a suite with a great view and 2 bedrooms\/bathrooms so that my friend and I didn't have to share.  First night here I swear a tornado blew threw town because the wind noise was so incredibly loud on the 26th floor and the windows and floor were actually shaking.

My first ever trip to Vegas was at Mandalay Bay and you never forget your first time to Vegas.

Was a surprise trip for my wife and the biggest thing we were looking for was a nice pool.  The Mandalay Beach far exceeded our expectations.  From the wave pool to the lazy river, it was all we hoped for and more. 

The first thing you notice about this hotel is the SMELL. What a smell it is. A tropical beach smell that you wish you could bottle and bring home.  Next is the beautiful lobby, complete with an aquarium.  

The room was well maintained, updated, and clean.  Very large for a standard room as well. Loved having a TV in the bathroom and a separate soaking tub and shower. 

The casino itself is HUGE and has a lot of dining and gaming options.  This is important because of how far south on the strip the hotel is located.  We spent more money than we would have liked taking cabs further north to get to the central strip.  Be prepared to do a lot of walking, even if you are looking just to get to the City Center\/Aria area. 

Very nice sports book and the poker room is right next to it, also a nice play to gamble.

The first day we checked in the room they gave us was dirty and we had to switch rooms. My biggest complant is I called down to see if we could get a frig since were going to be there so long the front desk told me it would cost $30 a day and she didn't even care how long we where staying thats $600 for a frig you can only put a couple of pops and maybe a half gallon of milk. I asked about 4 people to see if maybe someone would understand that I could go to sears and buy a brand new huge frig and know one  would would give us a break till about two nights into our stay and I called maintenance to replace a light buld and I told my story to the lady that came and she could not belive that she said I go find you one for free!

What I love is the many things to see and do here as well as awesome restaurants and fun shopping.  I also like the easy access Mandalay Place Mall that takes you to the Luxor.  Mandalay Bay is also the home to Michael Jackson One, the Cirque show that I have not yet seen, but that everyone who I have talked to about it absolutely raves about how wonderful it is.

Some of my favorite things are the Minus 5 Ice Bar and then the mall near that.  I like that the House of Blues has made it's home here and I LOVE RM Seafood and Fleur, some really delicious restaurants with great service.

On my recent trip, I also hit up the Shark Reef Aquarium, which was small, but nicely done.

Mandalay Bay has a HUGE convention\/events center and the one place I haven't been, but dream of hanging out at:  THE POOL!  It looks so fun and I plan to spend some time there one of these days!

All of the staff there that I have interacted with have been super friendly AND I've actually won money here gambling before.  I've just never had a negative experience at the Mandalay Bay, so hopefully, I'll one day also stay here and experience the hospitality and rooms!",1,0,1

Since we were only in town for the weekend, we didn't have time to enjoy the much buzzed about wave pool or the famous aquarium, but I've heard enough good things about both to know we should check them out next time. 

Check-in: 
Check in was pretty easy, only because we utilized the mobile check-in option - highly recommend! The day you're scheduled to arrive, Mandalay will send you a confirmation email where you'll have the option to check in via your cell. Once you do, they'll reserve your room and hold the key until your arrival. You still have to go to the mobile check-in desk in the lobby for them to confirm your identity, swipe your card, and hold your room, but I have to say.. it was pretty nice being able to bypass the insanely long line of people checking-in, in real-time. 

Parking: 
We opted to valet our car since it's easy come, easy go. We were there on a busy weekend, so it got a little backed up at one point, but nothing that wasn't tolerable. They also offer a self-parking option for a few bucks less ($10\/day to self-park vs $18\/day to valet).

Proximity: 
If you're in town for a game or event at the T-Mobile Arena, this is the hotel you want to book. It's at the end of the strip (south) and sits right off the I-15. If you're planning on spending a lot of time on the strip, keep in mind that Mandalay isn't super walkable for your average person\/family. However, the hotel does provide a complimentary shuttle that will get you as close to the center of the strip as possible. You'll still have to do a little bit of walking but the shuttle will drop you off at the Luxor and Excalibur, which helps tremendously. 

Room: 
This is where the hotel could've been better for me. The room was fine, but nothing special. When you request a room, they have a comment section that lets you include anything worth noting. We let Mandalay know we were in town for a very special occasion and still managed to get probably one of the worst views on the entire property. I'm just a firm believer in making guests feel like you're in on the celebration, so that was a missed opportunity for me. That aside, the room was clean and modern in style. The bathroom is great for girls who like to get ready together. Double sinks and vanity mirrors for the prissy!

Bonuses: Casino in the hotel, which is obviously a big deal for a lot of people. I didn't spend any time at the tables but the slots and the overall casino were very well kept up and had good gambling vibes. Some nice late night restaurant choices too, including the iconic House of Blues (features live music!). Lots of shops, cafes, tattoo parlors, and bars on-site, including the famous minus5 ice bar.",0,0,0

Upon check in, the line was long but the staff at the front desk managed to move it rather quickly. The lady who checked us in was  pleasant and nice, even though she had the hardest time looking for our reservation... She misspelled my first name, and then my last name... Jonathan Gonzalez... Fairly common you might think, but she also had my driver's license... So beyond me. Anyway, for the delay she offer us complementary tickets to the house of blues for Thursday night, which I though was a nice gesture to make up for the mess up. 
We ended up upgrading to a suite for $30 more a night, which I though was a great deal. The suite was very nice and the view was great from the 25th floor.
There was a moldy smell in the toilet room, not the bathroom entirely, only inside toilet room. Just a little bothersome being that this is a top notch type of place. 

The pools were nice, a little crowded for a Wednesday and Thursday but I'm sure not as bad as the weekend. We were able to find seats and relax by the pool.
 Which brings me to the next point, the seats for most of the property are filthy, they are the old white plastic bands type of chairs, and they have seen better days I'm sure. They all had a black film residue on them, which seemed improper for the property. The only pool that offered a different type of chair was the east lagoon, with green comfy chairs to relax by the pool. 

The kicker; and this is really what prompted my to write the review, was the unbelievably rude comment that a dealer made to my wife at the casino floor. His name is Bob, and older guy running a new game by the roulette table, it was a big wheel with surf boards on it, minimum bet was $1 and it seemed pretty straight forward to play and have a good time. 
As we are getting chips, my wife puts down $20 in $1 bills, to which this Bob comments ""did you just come from the topless club?""
Comment which we both ignored. Bob, not satisfied, went to ask again, ""are you sure you didn't just come from the topless club, or thunder down under?"" At this point I'm unsure if he is assuming my wife worked at such establishment or if he is just cracking a joke... But I surely thought it was extremely inappropriate.  We took our chips and left his table. 
This in turn, obviously ruined my wife's mood and therefore mine, so we called it a night and went to the room.
So great job Mandalay Bay in training you staff to insult your clients as they get ready to thoughtlessly waste their money on your casino floor, I hope it continues to work for you, because you won't see us again.",5,2,2

Our 4 rooms were on the same floor but not close together. The rooms were all very nice, spacious and clean with nice large bathrooms, and a couple rooms had excellent views of the pool and the strip (I would request this when you check-in). On Saturday we hung out by the pool and reserved a cabana, the pool\/beach area at Mandalay Bay is huge and the service was very good. We didn't experience the crowds that I read others dealt with and the people who were there varied from young partiers to families, so I think anyone would have a good time. We also chose to stay at Mandalay Bay because we wanted to go to a club one night and Mandalay Bay has Light right in the resort - it was a great club and people could leave whenever they wanted because they could easily walk right to their rooms.

Came here for a quick weekend with a friend who was in need of a quick weekend getaway, and she loves Vegas.  She suggested that we stay at the Mandalay Bay because of the great pool areas.
We stayed here 3 days two nights with another friend of ours who flew in from Portland.  
We never left the Mandalay property all weekend long.  Didn't need to.  Everything was self contained here.  There's plenty of nice restaurants and bars to choose from.  And there's I think 4 different pool areas including a wave pool beach area, and a rapid floating pool area.  And a 21 year and older pool area which was free for the women on Saturday that we were there, and $30 for the men!  
We had an okay dinner at the Border Grill.  The weekend we were there, the B52s and Blondie performed at the Mandalay Bay beach Saturday night!  Tickets were $60, but were discounted for guests staying at the Mandalay for a discounted price of $33!  The concert was great!  Especially the B52s!  They play on the stage next to the wave pool.  They shut the waves down and clear all the lounge chairs from the beach.  We watched the concert in the pool right in front of the stage!  It was awesome!
Now for the rooms.  The rooms are spacious and so was the bathroom, with double sinks and a separate room for the toilet - nice touch - and a separate shower stall and jacuzzi tub.  They're not the newest rooms, but they're nicely maintained and decorated.

My friend and I went back to Mandalay Bay for the weekend as they promise to make things right the second time around. We had a trip to Arizona so we decided to stay in Las Vegas for one night and use the comp room they gaved us. We booked the room back in June and on Monday of the weekend we were heading out, I called in to confirm. I was garauntee that we would have the same type of room we had last time which was 2 queen size beds. When we checked in on Saturday after a 9 hour drive, they put put me in a king size room. I told the lady at the front desk that I was promised 2 queen size when I called to confirm. The only option I could have is either a 2 queen size room that was for smokers or a king size room with a roll out bed.I had no choice but to compromise and accept the king size bedroom.
We went up to floor 25 room 108. We checked the room and there was no left over food, bugs or power problem like the last time we visited. We just got back visiting antelope canyon in vegas so the first thing we did was to take a shower. While my friend was taking her shower, I turn on the tv and there was no signal. The tv is still an issue just like our last visit, only instead of it flikering from the power saving mode, it is not showing any channels at all. When my friend was done with her shower, she came out and informed me that the water in the shower wont go down and is basically flowing out of the shower. Angry, I called the front desk and told them what happened and they told me that they will send over a technician. I demanded to speak to a manager as I was really upset because nothing seems to had change from the last time I was here, even though they told me otherwise. I believe the manager I spoke to was name Susan, and I told her exactly what has happened. We were promised over the phone on Monday that we will get 2 queen size beds, the tv has no signal whatsover, and now theres a flood happening in the bathroom. While I was on the phone with her, I instructed my friends to head down first and use the $100 comp we had while I get our room issue fix. the option to use the $100 is very limited and we decided to use it on the noodle but they are way overprice and not good. $17 for wonton soup and $20ish for pad thai. the engineer came and pretty much snake into the drainage to clear up the clog. Both the engineer and the manager informed me that the tv losing signal is a known issue and would be resolved in a few hours. Like the front desk, she says the only thing she can do is to put us in a smoking optional room that has 2 queen beds. After 2 or 3 more minutes with her on the phone, she offered us to stay in a bigger suite free of charge as our current room are having issues. I agreed so long as she personally go to the suite she is moving us to and personally inspect it to make sure there is no more issues. She agreed and told me she will sent some1 to pick up our luggage. I waited by myself for 15-20 minutes before giving up and calling front desk in which they reply that some1 will be there shortly as they were delayed for a bit. the manager susan then personally came up to my room to hand me my new keys and inform me that she did do a check and everything is good to go.
Finally got the luggage at the new suite at floor 28 room 108. Did a quick inspection and everything seems to check out. Another issued I had was after I have finish getting our bags to the new room, all my friends has finished eating and came back up, so I had basically stayed behind nearly half hour+ getting this issued fix. I was hungry, I was dirty from the desert, I was tired as i only slept 3 hours the last 48 hours. I finally went and took my shower but heres the worst part. i had closed the door to the bathroom door, turned around and as I was undressing, the bathroom door does not close and therefore, everyone on the bed was able to see me naked. I had to use a tower to wedge the door shut. After the shower, we head out, but because of how crapy i felt fromt his whole ordeal, I went back after an hour to rest up while the rest of my friend's continue to party without me. I went back to the front desk to complain and this time they brought another manager name Kristen. She said she will sent another engineer up to fix the door issue.the engineer came and fix the door. I went to sleep at 12 and my friends came back at 2. While they were getting ready for bed, both sink were clog. I was too tired at that point to complain again. Next morning, I checked out and ask to speak with Kristen again but she was already off duty. The manager there got my number and informed me that he will personally give her my number so she can contact me to work something out. That was 10am and when I got back home in Los Angeles at 9pm, no one has called me. i called back and Kristen informed me that no one informed her to call me back.this trip was by far the least enjoyable",1,1,0

the room was outstanding and the view was amazing.  loved that i could lay in bed and look at the entire strip without having to stand up and go to the window.  i like having a tv in the bathroom and now really wish i had one at home as well.  maid service usually cleaned up before 11 am, except our last day they never made it so we just got some extra towels which was fine. 

the beach area was great.  we had a blast in the wave pool and the lazy river.  first day we went down was tuesday morning at 9 am, there were a ton of chairs available.  it was beyond easy to find a chair.  we would leave around 11:00 to 12:00 to go eat lunch and coming back in the afternoon we were able to get chairs every day as well.  even saturday at 9 am there were hundreds of empty chairs.  it is not nearly as bad as the flamingo in terms of needing to be down there before 9 am or being screwed on chairs.  the sand gets hotter than the pavement to walk on so bring flip flops or be prepared to run.  they do have reserved seating which is essentially just a regular lounge chair with a red pad on it for i think 50 bucks a day.  the lazy river is the fastest lazy river ive been in.  you can buy their tubes for about $25, but we opted to bring $4 tubes from target and never once were we told we could not do so.  lots of people brought in their own tubes.  the wave pool was a blast, you will hear a lot of whistle blowing as you have to move back behind a blue line before the wave comes every two minutes before you can ride it in.  it may annoy some people, but i could care less.  overall the beach was a blast.  if you hate kids running around though, you might hate this.

for restaurants we ate at stripsteak which is outstanding, burger bar, and house of blues.  have a martini at red square, and if you like bloody mary's they have a really top notch one their as well.  

there is a free tram from mandalay to luxor to excalibur as noted by others.  the tram does not start running until 9 am and it ends at 10:30 pm.  so basically don't expect to ride it back.  i remember years back it went 24 hours, then a year ago it cut off about midnight so within a couple years it should be closed by 5 pm each night.  

overall it was a good experience.  honestly im not a huge fan of the ritzy fancy hotels like the venetian or bellagio, but i liked mandalay bay.  it was the right amount of niceness without being too fancy for me.  if i had a good deal i would stay again in the summer, but i do enjoy being a little more centrally located",9,3,7

That is way too long to check in. When we got to the front of the line check in was quick. We were given a king room strip view. But I went to sit on a chair and it was filthy dirty, then I checked the bed and it was also dirty. We return to the lobby and we're giving a different room. There was no apologies made to us. We then went out to check out the pool area, where I was then puked on vacation. None of the staff seem to care, but then again neither did anyone else. 

Pool area was nice but full of kids. Hotel seemed a little outdated. It is a very large resort at the end of the strip, very long walks to anything. Lots of dining options and entertainment options. I highly suggest Michael Jackson show.

Disappointments were outweighing the good parts though.
While checking in the clerk told us that we could have complimentary late checkout=1pm! We were super excited as we wanted to sleep in! Housekeeping was banging on doors and asking to clean at 8am! We wanted to go to breakfast but I had a weird feeling about the late check out. The front desk said we must be out at 11am because they are booked! What a total bummer, but she did say we can keep our keys and use the pool. We shoved our stuff quickly into bags, took them to the car, and ate breakfast at Ri Ra. We went to the pool (beach) and were happy to sit for a while. While reentering the building three was another huge surprise. As we neared the gift shop it looked like a lady in front of us was slipping and nearly falling down. As this happened, I realized that I had also stepped into a large pile of human feces on the marble floors! It was all over the place! Really?!?!?!?! I nearly vomited. I sent Mark into the gift shop to have them call for help. I waited there trying to help people avoid the mess and trying to not make a larger mess of myself. When I finally got an employee who could radio for help he told me to take off my shoe and go wash it in the restroom. Gross! I realize that the hotel didn't poop on the floor, but this was absolutely nasty. The saving grace was a sweet little old lady in the restroom. She had several of us lined up while she sprayed disinfectant and scrubbed our shoes with a scrubber! (That woman should get a medal!) I was shocked that it took so long to get anyone to come help, and further shocked that not one employee came to check on all of the guests who had such a crappy experience! I did call customer service, but I felt it was condescending for them to just say they will pass this on to management, no one should have had to take their shoes off when they didn't  want to.

The clusters of green palms, the scent of simulated coconut, vanilla and ocean that fills your nostrils upon entering, the marble everywhere... however, the illusion is quickly shattered by the onslaught of guests walking around in bermuda shorts and flip flops, toting their bud lights and telling obnoxious jokes. Ah well... you are in Vegas, after all.  

The Mandalay is a massive complex - you could have a complete holiday here and never once leave the resort. My only complaints are purely subjective - wish they wouldn't allow smoking in the casino (simu-vanilla and ocean can only cover the scent of smoke so much), and wish everything wasn't so damned expensive... but that applies to all of Vegas. I quite liked the array of restaurants - highlights include The Border Grill for fresh and authentic tacos, Raffles for a satisfying breakfast (my husband referred to it as a glorified IHOP - not a bad thing), and the House of Blues for southern eats. Avoid the Noodle Shop if you are looking for Asian food that is not bland, safe and overly priced, and please, don't order the pizza from room service. Ick. 

Some of the attractions at the Mandalay include the beach\/pools megazone... great if you're trying to have some sort of MTV Spring Break moment, otherwise, not really my cup of tea. Again, kind of subjective - I'll take an ocean over a bunch of pools in the desert any day. We quite enjoyed the Shark Reef Aquarium... lots of interesting species to observe. Don't let them rope you into a cheesy souvenir photo though!

Overall... compared to the other casino complexes we visited, the Mandalay is your best bet - the decor isn't too over the top, but still feels luxurious, and the guests aren't exeedingly obnoxious. Rooms are lovely and comfortable - can't say no to a TV in the bathroom to enjoy while soaking in your nice big tub!

One final warning, applicable to all Vegas casino complexes - if you are planning on drinking and trying to navigate through the casino back to your room, be sure to make distinct note of landmarks when you're sober... getting back to the room without sufficient navigational skills can be a challenge indeed, even for the mildly tipsy.",0,0,0

They've outdone themselves with the pool.  It's huge and has the whole lazy river with inner tubes.  OMG some of the SEXIEST women I've seen come here.  Talk about a pleasant distraction, they even have a clothing optional area.  I've caught a glimpse of the action and it looks pretty good.  On top of that the cabanas are more private ( you know what i mean ; ) ) and have nicer amenities(plasmas) than the other casinos.  Just make sure you reserve one a day in advance on busy weekends.  

The only two places i've eaten were at the raffles cafe and the bayside buffet that overlooks the pool.  Both are good.  I would not eat all day just to do their buffet.  My friends challenged me to a alaskan crab leg eating contest once but couldn't keep up even though i had three plates.

Pro: If you get a strip facing room on a higher floor-killer view. I asked for this at check-in and I received an 18th floor strip facing room view.
Pro: Tram that takes you to Luxor & Excalibur; if you don't want to go to those hotels, you can walk from there.
Pro: Moorea\/Daylight Day Club: If you're an adult and don't want to experience the pool along with screaming children and sand everywhere, go to Moorea or Daylight.  I loved Moorea- great drinks, great music, nice adult vibe; keep in mind that this is a Top-tional pool and dudes- you might have to pay $50 to enter (ladies are free).
Now for the Cons:
Con: Far from the center of the strip and you'll have to take a cab anywhere- you dont want to walk from here people, trust me.
Con: Every time I played a slot or table game, no cocktail waitresses were around to offer me a free drink.
Con: Price is not worth value, IMO.
Con: Hotel is outdated and could use some updates\/sprucing up to compete with newer resorts (i.e. Aria\/Cosmopolitan).

It has gotten to the point where resort fees, taxes on taxes and now parking costs more than the cost of the room.   It is either time to visit non-MGM properties or stop the weekend runs to the Strip.   We noticed on this trip that the valet parking was virtually empty on Friday and Saturday nights, feel sorry for the valet staff that relied on the tips they used to get.  

There was also a very noticeable lack of drink hostesses, I played in two separate locations one night, 2 hour minimum at both, and not a single hostess came by.  I caught fleeting glances of a couple of them, or maybe it was a desert mirage?  The second night I played in one area for at least another two hours and (you guessed it) bupkiss!  

Past review below (when parking was free)

Trying to get past the stigma of being the sister property of the Delano, the Mandalay Bay's newly refurbished rooms truly hit the mark.  The property is beautiful and the service was generally exceptional.   There is an area in the valet parking area for Uber\/Lyft that was an added perk.  The restaurant food quality was very good but the overall experience varies by server, a higher level of standard service expectations would raise the property to 5 star level.  I know the restaurants are independently operated but it still reflects on Mandalay Bay.   So glad we did not stay away from the property due to past Delano experiences.

The lady says ""your in the wrong line"" ""go to that one since you paid by credit card"" and points to this huge line that goes past where security was! Then as you get back to where the ticketing line is some guy tells you "" your in the wrong line, go over to that line"" pointing at the one you just got removed from. 

The attitude of the hotel event staff is horrible. The ushers to the seats were okay. 

The seats are uncomfortable and small. The stage is small. The arena is small. The acoustics deplorable. 

Overall the experience was poor and way over priced. Iron Maiden is a great band with strong fan support. They are too big of a show for this two bit, hastily put together venue.

Thank you again, we appreciate it and can honestly say that we admire the very fast reply! 
_________________________

We had a two night stay this past week and we thought it was a so-so experience. Mandalay Bay is not a bad hotel, but it's not great either. It was a quick trip for us and our rooms were comped from the myvegas app. Check in was fast and easy, the person who checked us in was personable, and friendly after I initiated conversation (asked her how her day was going). I personally find stiffer beds more comfortable, same with my husband. Our room's bed wasn't firm, it was soft and sunk in. It wasn't horrible, just seemed old, we weren't too bothered by it. 

The bigger decor pillows on the bed smelled a little strange, so did the extra pillow from the closet. We decided not to use any of those, the regular ones were fine. 

The bathroom was nice, it was strange that there wasn't a fan switch - we weren't used to that. I thought about taking a bath, but decided not to after I turned on the faucet for a minute. When I went to drain the little water I had drawn, it smelled sort of like sewer water. Decided to stay away from the bathtub at that point. The shower floor was a little worn, not sure how to describe it but I wish it had been a tad more clean. 

The room was big, and I think we had a beach view; its too bad we were there during the winter. I think we would have enjoyed the festivities that take place in the summer. The pools looked awesome and so did the entire pool\/beach area. The little chair\/ottoman seemed like it was from the 70's but was probably from the 90's, not bad, but not the best either. 

We were comfortable in our room, and didn't have too many issues, they were all tolerable. However, on our last night the top sheet fell off the bed and some of the comforter was exposed (the comforter is in between two white sheets) and we saw some faded stains and a couple dirty spots on the blanket. We really didn't want to make a fuss on our last night, and felt we shouldn't complain, since the room was comped. So we covered the comforter back up with the two clean sheets and toughed it out (it wasn't a huge deal, we're easy going - plus we had those clean sheets, is that weird? don't judge us). 

We left early the next morning and checked out using the texting option. It was fast and easy.

I do want to mention that the casino had a crazy perfume smell. It smelled like potpouri vapors were pumping into the ventilation system there. It was that + a tobacco smell. At first we didn't mind it, but on our second day it became pretty bothersome and we both had headaches (no not due to alcohol!). My husband felt pretty sick, but whenever he got back up to the hotel or went outside, he instantly felt much better. I think it was a combo of the heat being on what seemed like full blast, the perfume smell and the cigarette smoke (he's a casual smoker so he's normally not bothered by it). We noticed that there were all sorts of weird smells in the casinos, not just Mandalay Bay. 

Room service food was okay at best. The lady who delivered it was super nice though. 

Anyway - it really was a so-so experience and we can't be upset about our experience, it was free. I wonder if there are remodeled rooms, if there are - I would probably try and stay in one of those rather than the one that I stayed in this past stay. Not sure if we will actually stay here again though.",0,0,0

The rooms are average sized with a larger bathroom than you would normally see in a hotel room.  The pool was closed when we were there but there is supposed to be a fake beach where they fly in all the sand, and there is supposedly a nude pool which has a bar by it.

The casino was nice and filled with many all-night gamblers.  I felt comfortable at this hotel and it was decently priced.  I would totally stay there again.  Travel websites have all sorts of deals for hotels in Vegas so check them our and maybe Mandalay Bay might be one of the options.

We had problems with a lack of hot water every single time we took a shower.  We called, they told us to let the water run for 5-10 minutes first. This did not help, and it's a pretty ridiculous suggestion when the hotel is certainly not cheap. For $250 a night I would certainly expect hot water for a shower.  After calling the first day they told us they'd send someone up to fix a valve.  Apparently this didn't happen because we had the same issue the next day.  I got in the lukewarm shower, put shampoo in my hair and then the water went ice cold.  On the third day they sent someone up who replaced a valve\/shower knob, but you will never have a hot shower unless you let the water run for 10 minutes.  Our uber driver told us this is a known issue at this hotel.

Our $200+ a night hotel room included zero complimentary amenities.  No mini fridge ($40 a night if you ask), no microwave, no complimentary coffee, no complimentary water, or plastic cups (to take ice to the pool).  No complimentary late check out.

We decided to pay $30 extra for late check out, and ended being locked out of our room early anyways.  This happens a lot.

We were charged $4 for coffee that we never made in the room. We didn't touch it. We paid the outrageous prices downstairs to not have to make it ourselves and still overpay.

The feel of the hotel and room were pretty nice as you'd expect (nice new furniture, carpets, cool mural wallpaper) but my only complaint is that no matter how many lights I turned on it always felt dark at the desk where I was trying to work (I know most people aren't in Vegas to work, but just in case haha).  Having two closets, and two sinks was great.  There's no fan in the toilet area so that's a little weird for privacy\/ventilation.  
The beach\/pool area was really cool. There's a cardio center, but I didn't try that out.  I liked that the ventilation in the casino was decent, so the smoke smell wasn't too overwhelming.  Everything is absolutely insanely expensive in general, but I guess that's to be expected in Las Vegas.  My favorite part about our stay was how friendly the cleaning, and the pool staff were.

I wouldn't stay here again unless it were free or steeply discounted.  There are way too many other options on The Strip.  My last trip here I stayed at The Westin and that was awesome. It even included a free happy hour.",6,4,6

Not once, but three different times they messed up the charges on our room. We were owed a credit for one room, which was processed as a charge rather than a credit, which, fine, human error. It happens to us all, and I was totaling willing to overlook it. But the next room, a suite, which we had booked for two nights for our wedding was overcharged. We were charged for things friends had left specific instructions for regarding payment, but we were still charged. We were promised a credit for room service and food, which was never added to the account, and four days later we are still trying to figure out what they did and how we were charged for things, how promised credits were not provided, and how to fix it. While Guest Services has been helpful in getting this sorted out, this shouldn't have been an issue with a hotel that charges so much in the first place! That really has been the biggest hit against what was an otherwise amazing weekend. 

I recommend Mandalay for the views and the pool (which was packed), but make sure to have a straight forward situation and not require anything fancy in order to avoid getting over-charged or double-charged for rooms and services.",1,0,0

When I returned late in the night back to my room, I decided to check if the problem of hot water and force was solved, it wasn't and I spoke to the manager right away and they decided to take care of it and first I was offered $ 50 for the problem in the morning for it and in the night I was offered half the cost of the night. I was tired and just wanted to sleep, and to my surprise I am told by engineer I have to move out of the room immediately and I called to speak to the same manager who offered me half the cost per night and she mentioned that I have to move out to another as that was my only choice. She didn't not call back or follow up after or say anything further about it at all till date. I would never want anybody to experience this kind of hospitality where I was rewarded half the rate per night for such an incident.",1,0,1

only thing i was feeling iffy about was the fact in one room our tv would not turn off. no remote or button on the tv would turn it off. so the whole night we slept through it. the other downfall is downstairs its not as lively as other hotels and not really a large selection of food to eat from so a tip for you guys is to take their tram thats in the hotel to luxor or the hotel next to luxor and its free! quick way to get closer to the strip!! also, we took that tram for food as well as to get closer and walk across to MGM Grand where we went for night clubbing. awesome tram that my friend found that saved us a lot of time and money :)",1,1,2

I have stayed at Mandalay Bay 3 times in the last 15 months and all times before were great. This visit was to celebrate my birthday on 8\/13\/15. When making the reservation, I requested a strip view and a 2 bedroom suite. Now mind you I am not getting comped rooms, I am paying full price - my room bill before ""tax, tag and title"" was $3070.00.  I know that they cannot guarantee a spefic view, it is impossible. But one can hope, especially since it was my birthday.  I called two days prior and asked if they could again please make a note about the strip view as I had a guest who had never been to Vegas. The representative said it didn't look like a problem at all. We arrived at the hotel at 4 pm to a line of check ins that took us a hour to get through becasue there was only 5 people working the front desk. Once we finally get our turn, the first thing out of the receiptionists mouth was: I see you wanted a strip view, and there is not one available. We can move you to a strip view in 3 days if you like. I said NO, I like to unpack and in 3 days it will be too much of a bother. She said that I should feel grateful because most people were getting down graded all together. I said, I'm paying full price for my room, I'm the last person to get down graded. And with that, I was given my keys and we were off.  We are night people and go to bed when the sun comes up. At 9 am on the dot, I awake in total fear that a earthquake was shaking the hotel. Only to find out, they were jackhammering two floors up, and the way the building is built, it feels like it is in your actual room. I immediately called the front desk. The nice gentlemen put me on hold and called engineering.  He said the 11th floor was being remodeled and the noise would be over in 2 hours.  2 hours of jack hammering at 9am?? They said they could move me, but it would not be a suite. I said for two hours, I would wait it out.  They gave me $100 food and beverage credit. As I go check on my friend in the other room to see if he was ok, he is drenched in sweat and his room temperature was 86 degrees. I call back down to the front desk and they said they would get someone right out. And they did show up, and he worked for about a hour on the A\/C while we kinda slept on the couch waiting for him to finish. Which he did and he left.  And we both went back to sleep. When we woke up several hours later, my friend said, I don't think my room is any cooler. I said give it time. We left for the day and night and came back about 5am to find his room again at 86 degrees. I immediately called and was told it was 5am, and she could not send anyone to the room that early. I said fine, send them at noon. Which they did, and we both ended up awake again till this time the A\/C was repaired. The next am, we are awaken to what now sounds like sanding the floors above us, and this continued all day. I didn't even waste my breath complaining. The next day we came back to the room at 4pm and they were jack hamnmering again, but we were not staying in the room long. On Sunday am, our last day there, there is banging so loud the person in guest services could hear the noise on the phone. Again they offered to move us, but we were leaving the next day. So they said they would credit my last night there. I said we were initially told it was going to be two hours, which was a obvious lie, or we would have moved. Basically, the entire stay at Mandalay Bay in the room was beyond terrible. The casino was great, as was the pool, and all the restaurants. And so was MJ's ONE!  Chester and Teresa that bartend at Eye Candy was the only good part of the stay!  But there was no excuse for what we had to tolerate in the room. The last day, I saw a engineering guy in the elevator and said, You really must be tearing up the 11th floor.  He laughed and said it was about every 4th floor in my tower. I said the front desk acted like they didn't know anything about it. He just laughed and said ""enjoy your stay"".  By the time I was back in Florida I had a email survey waiting for me from Mandalay Bay.  I repeated everything I just put here, including that I was offered $100 Food Credit and one night was taken off my 6 night bill and I felt my ""room visit"" was beyond a nightmare.   I got a some what personalized return email from my survey from Leslee-Ann Barclay. She said ""I do hope your recent stay will not prevent you from allowing Mandalay Bay another opportunity to serve you"". Well Leslee-Ann, I am only one person and got treated the way I did, you could have done more to make up for my horrible stay.  So I am letting my  fellow Yelpers know about what happened, and now you need to be worried about wether or not they will allow ""Mandalay Bay a oppurtunity to SERVE THEM""!!",0,0,0

There isn't enough wait staff anywhere in the hotel.  They are short on bell desk, valet, cocktail waitress, front desk, and help on the floor.  It took sometimes 15 minutes just for the few people they had to move the cars so we could park.  The Shortage of people seemed to show in the service.  There were some exceptions but you can tell that the staff doesn't even have a second to breathe.  They are inundated and frustrated.

The exterior always looks gorgeous. I also always go to the buffet, and I think the quality of food is better than the Bellagio's buffet even though there isn't as much of a variety. 
They removed the giant fish tank that was in their check-in lobby :( so now there are just a bunch of seats laying around.

I can't keep my eyes off of you... Haha I digress... 

Mandalay Bay is one of those classy, but comfortable hotels that sits at the front of the strip, which has multiple benefits. 

1) The strip is notorious for bad drivers and pesky pedestrians who continue to walk even though red hand is flashing - Since this hotel is right at the beginning you can by-pass this part :)
2) Because it's at pne end of the strip,  you can get a beautiful view of the city of lights without having to hear all the noise pollution
3) There's a tram that connects to Luxor\/Excalibur: The tram runs from 11:00 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. Monday through Friday, and until 12:30 on Saturday and Sunday nights, so it's very convenient.

The rooms itself was very nice and accommodating and on this most recent trip I had the opportunity to stay in a suite, which included a large tub and mini tv! Woo! The beds are incredibly comfortable and with a big screen TV I was able to relax and enjoy late night shows after a long day of eating and shopping. 

The only drawback is that the room's mini fridge. They have a motion censor so if you move anything in the fridge they'll charge you for the items. :( I like to bring home leftovers and to keep my own beverages cold, but this doesn't seem to be an option.

As far as Mandalay's casino goes, I have a hard time complaining. They offer up the usual compliment of card tables, slots, video crack (poker), craps, a huge sports book and all sorts of high-roller action. For me, it was all about penny slots and blackjack here. I discovered a unicorn-themed penny slot machine that magically granted me $30+ in winnings on my first night in the casino. I could almost smell the rainbows. 

Second night I posted up at a $15 minimum blackjack table, and while I wish these casinos would have at least one $5 minimum table I know that $15 is the new strip standard. Regardless, after three hours and at least as many dealers I walked away 150% richer and with no less than 15 Kennedy-heads in my pocket. Did I say walk? I meant stumble. And the only reason I left is that they closed down the pit for cleaning. 

Otherwise it's a pretty clean casino, nice and hidden down at the end of the strip, and there are plenty of places to fuel up for a night elsewhere on the strip.",5,5,6

Let's start with the ups. 

-The restaurant choices are excellent. You can go hear great music at House of Blues or enjoy their Gospel Brunch on Sundays. Fleur and Aureole are spectacular and you have to check out the contraption that delivers the bottles of wine to you. I can't describe it, you just have to see it for your self.
-Nice size rooms with large bathrooms. The shower is separate from the deep whirlpool bathtub and I always enjoy double sinks when traveling with my husband.
Dual closets is a plus-plenty of room to hang your nightlife attire with lots of available hangers.
-the Bath House Spa at THEHotel (connected to Mandalay Bay) was AWESOME!! I could have stayed in there all day. I have been to several spas in my life and I would say this was one of the most unique spas to visit. If you go, you need to pay a visit to the Bath House spa.
-Majority of the staff were pleasant to deal with (even when they were messing up, they remained smiling and would apologize numerous times about the inconvenience)

Now the downs and believe me, there are some major downs..

-room was dirty when we arrived. There were stains on the sheets and comforter and pistachio nut shells on the floor. eewww!
-elevators are slow so don't wait until last minute to go anywhere
-agree with other Yelpers that the casino area could use some updating
-Now I talked about how much I loved the spa but be sure to note that it is expensive. I got a basic 45 minute pedicure there and it cost $80 plus tip and that was the cheapest pedicure possible. All the other ones with coconut cream, deluxe, etc were over $100. CRAZY!! If my lil piggies weren't in such dire need of new polish, I would have said Thanks, but No Thanks!!
-Concierge staff are super nice but when I booked my tickets over the phone before coming to Vegas, the lady booked half of the tickets on the wrong date even though the itinerary they sent me had all the tickets confirmed for the correct date. Instead of giving me a $500 credit back on to my credit card, they said they could only apply a credit to my hotel bill. I wasn't thrilled with the idea but I figured that I would probably spend about that much on my room, other shows, food, spa etc so I didn't complain too much after they said twice it wasn't possible to credit my Visa back. Well.....when it was time to check out, they had only applied the credit to food and beverage at the hotel and therefore I still had almost $300 left on there. I told the lady checking me out that this was incorrect and that concierge said it could be applied to anything in the hotel (shopping, shows, the spa, etc). I stood at the Check out desk for almost an hour while that lady and her manager were trying to work it out. Their excuse was that Concierge was a different department and they didn't share the same account, yada yada yada. I told them that I was about to miss my flight now that I have been messing with this for so long. Told them to please just email me the receipt once it has been worked out so that I could leave for the airport. 

And of course, I get the receipt and view my credit card bill and GUESS WHAT..wait for it..wait for it... it is STILL incorrect... I am sure that it is going to require at least another hour long phone call to straighten it all out...",5,0,0

to a third floor handicap accessible room with a view of the parking garage, small windows and no tub.  The room had a weird smell and was completely unacceptable.

Check in is at 3:00, we arrived at 4:00. We told the room type we reserved was unavailable.  One hour after check in began, they were sold out of our type of room.

We were also told our reservation guaranteed us a room, not any specific type of room.

After voicing our displeasure with the ""upgrade"", we were offered Thursday night free and the possibility of moving to another room for Friday and Saturday, or we could change rooms immediately.  We choose to move because of the ""possibility"" qualification placed on the offer.

The second room was very nice and the staff was courteous and friendly, especially the bell hop which helped us move.  Nice view, real windows as advertised.

We were disappointed that the pool closed at 6:00 on Friday and 5:00 on Saturday, it was close to 90 degrees and beautiful, I don't know why anyone would want to stay outside by a beautiful pool in the sun rather than in a cold air conditioned hotel\/casino.  Maybe that's just me not understanding the squeeze every penny possible out of your guest mentality of resorts in Las Vegas.

Our shower and tub appeared to have something weird in the plumbing in that you would adjust the water to the desired temperature and in about 5-7 minutes the cold portion would go to hot and the water would become scalding. There was no cold available to mix with the hot, only hot and hot. After another 3-5 minutes it would go back to normal.  Also had to call and have the toilet in the half bath unplugged, it would not flush. 

Other than overpriced, dishonest staff at check in, plumbing issues, too short pool hours, it was a beautiful hotel\/casino.

Oh and by the way, the room rate quoted does not include the 
12% Room tax, Resort Fee, and12% Resort Fee Tax

This added up to another $162.84 on our three day stay, so add roughly $55 to the quoted rate and you will be close to the actual cost.",1,0,0

The room was great, we stayed on the 27th floor with a view of the strip.  The room was a nice size the bathroom was large.  The toilet was behind a seperate door from the shower, tub and sink.  The only problem there was no ventilation in the bathroom. Nice size flat screen on the wall, Ipod alarm clock hook-up and very comfortable bed.  My 1st night home, my hubby and I decided we need a new mattress;-)

The pool was great(they had several), and a beach with sand and a wave pool.  You can rent Cabanas for the day to get out of the sun , It was between 108-110 degrees all week.  The cabanas come with several amenities, like tv, celing fan and several lounge chairs and beverages.  They are pricey starting at $250, I definitely suggest if you are with a large party.

The hotel is beautiful.  I am a Vegas frequent and I can find all my needs at Mandalay Bay.  Whether it's fine dining or just casual eateries, this hotel offers it all.  We were able to check in at noon once we arrived on Thursday morning.  The room was overall clean and really nice, the bed was sooo soft and comfy and the two flat screens (one in the room and one in the bathroom) were a plus.   The bathroom was great with the marble tile, granite double sinks and separate shower and bathtub.

The beach was a lot of fun!  Summer hours are 8AM-7PM.  There were a ton of people, but we managed to find at least one chair to put all our stuff and we spent the entire time at the wave pool.  If you come around 5-6PM, most people leave to probably go to dinner or prep for clubbing, so sometimes there are groups of seats that are available.

Ok, here are the negatives which I agree with other yelpers:
- The line to check in was absurd.  There are so many windows for people to walk up to, but they only open 4 lines making the wait at least half an hour to check in.  We saw one elderly woman try to check in after standing in line for half an hour and she was told to come back later.
- There are lines for EVERYTHING, from baggage check in to taxis to elevators.  Be prepared to add an additional half an hour to wherever you are planning to go during the weekend.
- There were a couple pillows that had a musty smell, I didn't want to know why.
- Our ""recuperating"" sign was taken away from our door, not cool.

Overall the stay was awesome.  I would definitely be back to Mandalay Bay to try out more restaurants and just chill by the pool.",1,0,0

As locals we can take advantage of deals, for out of staters it's hard. This hotel is always priced right for what it delivers. Caution this hotel can get very busy due to conventions and the convention center attached. If you want a more quiet hotel I wouldn't come here. It's always packed. For conventions this hotel is mobbed. Restaurants are a massive wait if there is a convention. 

If you are looking for fun shops Mandalay place has some great spots. Like the noodle house and house of blues. Both offer different experiences. Also both have great food. House of blues is great if you like concerts and music venues. House of noodles is my favorite because I'm a food junky and noodles are in my blood :)

If you are trying to stay here make sure there isn't a convention if there isn't one stay here and make sure you pop into the aquarium. It's absolutely stunning full of beautiful sea life that you can't see many other places. Plus the ticket prices are great for not wanting to leave the hotel.

Second, when you enter Mandalay Bay whenever Light is open you have to walk through a MAZE OF SMOKE, literally its like you are in a smog tunnel to get into the hotel... WHY???  I don't like breathing in that smoke, it isn't healthy and why can't they confine it to the club and not let it bellow into the whole entrance way???  Thirdly, as it gets late in the evening say around 3AM and you are playing slots, you cannot remove your ticket and put it in another machine.  NO so don't take it out because you have to cash it and thus is the other problem, the CASH MACHINES DO NOT CASH TICKETS AT THAT TIME, so if you are playing in the back of the hotel you have to take your ticket and walk all the way to the front to the Cashier cage to get paid????? why??? then walk all the way back to play a different machine, the floor slot attendants can't cash the ticket either so they tell you to go to the cashier, like it was a few steps away when its across the whole hotel..... They certainly don't make things easy for their guests..... Lastly, why does Phoenix always play the weekend??? is there not other groups that could play there, Phoenix's music is the same old thing, and we have heard it enough.... time for some new blood, some new music and something that is danceable..... won't be back to Mandalay Bay too much hassle to get into the hotel, too much hassle to get paid or cash your ticket, too much of listening to Phoenix.... just my opinion.",1,1,0

Upon entering, I couldn't help but gaze around and take everything in. The inside looks very grand with marble everywhere and remarkable chandeliers. It's amazing how genuinely homey, familiar, and non-intimidating the atmosphere and the people were.

Once inside our room, I was immediately happy about how spacious it was. There was plenty of seating in the living room area with a table to set things down. The bedroom had tons of closet space as well as drawers for storing other belongings. The bathroom features a walk-in shower, separate toilet room, granite countertops, marble floors, two sinks, and a huge light-up mirror.

It's really more a 3.5, but Yelp doesn't let you do halves (I think it's a crime how you can't do zero).

Today, I went here for the first time in, like, 4 years (which was for the NBA All Star Game Festivities) and I barely remembered what it was like inside. 
It's huge, and very easy to get lost in. There are various water features located throughout the whole entire building and there's this weird wall next to the Aureole restaurant which has fragments of a nude female statue. 
It's a more neutral, middle of the lane place. Hooray for no desperate edginess (see: Planet Hollywood) or desperate elegance (see: Wynn).
Also, since there isn't a separate listing for the theater, I'll review it here:

The lobby for this theater is huge and beautiful. Inside the theater, there's really not a bad seat in the house and the acoustics are very good. The seats themselves sucked on the other hand. They were so uncomfortable and seem like they haven't been changed since the place originally opened. There is also so little room in the aisles that it's virtually mandatory to stand up when someone else needs to get in or out of their seat. Oh, and concessions are ridiculously overpriced.

But, I'm not that person anymore. I don't mind mostly sticking to my own hotel\/resort, as long as it's good and there's stuff to do, and the Mandalay Bay pays off in that regard. There's decent restaurants (really, go to the Border Grill), the pool is awesome (show up at the lazy river early and don't bother with renting a locker, they're a pain in the ass to get to and unnecessary), and the aquarium is actually kind of cool and worth a visit.

You can sort of get to somewhere you want to go if you take the tram to Excalibur and then walk from there, but pedestrian traffic to and from this place seems to be actively discouraged.

A girlfriend and I had chosen to stay here in may of last year and had an awful experience- rude front desk, dirty glasses, blood stains on an extra pillow we requested!  We complained and were offered a refund or a comped 2-night stay. We decided to give Mandalay bay another chance and chose the comped stay.

Well I am currently checked-in and this is not turning out to be any better. First they booked a king room, when we needed 2 queens.  There was hair on the pillows as if turned over for the next guest, a dirty sheet in the closet, and mascara on the washcloth!  ( I went here with Jillian T., if you can tell by the similarities in our reviews).  

We complained and they changed our room, but this one has nasty looking prints on the window.  At least we got a $50 credit to the noodle shop.  

NEVER staying here again. Caesar's Palace is a better deal, better location, and is an ACTUAL 4 star resort, unlike this dump.  The pool over there is way better too.

The one on purpose was way back in 2003, for a surprise trip to Vegas for my 21st birthday. The hotel was pretty new and was the fanciest, most beautiful place I had ever stayed up until then.

This review is about the time I stayed there on accident, in 2010.

My then boyfriend (now Hubs) had never been to Vegas, so I decided to surprise him with a trip to Vegas a few weeks after his birthday. To make things even more memorable, he proposed to me on HIS birthday. So, we had several things to celebrate - his 27th birthday and our engagement.

I had gotten a killer deal through Vegas.com to stay at theHotel (now you're probably seeing where the ""accident"" part of this comes in). We would be flying out of Sonoma County to Vegas and staying at theHotel for three nights, all for about $500. Total. Killer deal, right?

When we got to the front desk of theHotel the agent asked if we wanted to upgrade to a Penthouse at Mandalay for $100 extra dollars a night. I'm not afraid to admit that on this trip we had a strict budget, so we declined the upgrade. The agent, a little surprised by our decline of the penthouse, tried to talk us into the deal by showing us pictures of the room and telling us that we would have a private entrance, etc. As sweet as it sounded, it was a no-go for us. Plus I really wanted to stay at theHotel. The agent told us to hold on while he talked to his manager. He came back and offered the upgrade for $100 for all three nights. (At this point I realize that they overbooked at theHotel and are trying to avoid telling us that by trying to get us to pay for an upgrade at their sister hotel). My now fiance, in his wisdom, told them, ""No, we would really rather spend the money on gaming at Mandalay's casino."" The agent steps away again and comes back and tells us that the Penthouse upgrade will be complimentary. I say ""Sweet"" and he says, ""No, Penthouse."" 

This killer deal of ours included a $100 resort credit, which I asked our agent if it covered the resort fee. He said usually no, but that he would waive the resort fee. We were definitely feeling like some lucky SOBs at this point.

Okay, so now we have a Penthouse. And $100 resort credit, and no resort fees. Things are looking good. We find the private elevator and up we go to the second highest floor. Granted, we are facing the airport but I don't think we really cared too much at this point.

This penthouse was insane. I felt like we needed an entourage to stay there. HUGE is the only way to put it.

However, the rooms are starting to show their age. The air conditioner in the living area rattled a bit (funny story there involving the handyman who came to work on it, but it's not something I will share on Yelp). Some of the controls didn't work great. But for the price we paid it was amazing. So baller. And quiet on those top floors. Seriously, the private elevator thing was so nice.

Mandalay Bay treated us well. No one trying to sell us stuff as we walked through the casino, just staff handing out free passes and being very helpful. (Got free passes to Mix and had a lovely time looking out from that vantage point). It also helps that we won some money on Roulette at a little table we found. 

We saw The Lion King here, which was phenomenal.

Checkout was a bit of a pain in the ass with the wait, but otherwise our time here was a happy one, and perfect for our multitude of reasons to celebrate. 

I'm not usually one to stay in the same place twice, so I won't be back for a repeat stay since I've been twice already, but I will always remember the time we got to live it up in a Penthouse.",3,2,2

I went for the first time this past week for 4 days and 3 nights. The decor was sweet in the standard room and hallway with beige colors, and the bathroom was nice with both a stand-up shower and a soak-in tub. I heard it was a good hotel but I did not want to expect too much. I was blown away! For one, the slots were good to me on several occasions, as I played them every night. I put in $5 into a quarter machine and hit $400, the most epic win for me of all time thus far. To that end, MB will ALWAYS be dear to my heart. They also had a table game promo for buy-in $20 and get $30  in casino chips so that was fun. I played blackjack switch.

It's absolutely beautiful on the inside and out even more than any hotel I have seen in my past 3 trips to Vegas. It's bright and spacious with a South beach theme all throughout. Great for photo ops! The vibe is amazing and everyone at the table genuinely smiled and laughed while teaching me the difference between regular blackjack and blackjack switch. Great times.

We saw the Lion King here and it was just as ridiculously amazing here as it was when I saw it on Broadway in NY and London! It was full-length too unlike some broadway shows on the strip. I did not get to see all the wonderfully beautiful (in pics) restaurants nor did I get a chance to see Mandalay place (but my friend loved it) BUT I did see the POOL!

I have thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Mandalay Bay in the early part of December 2010.  Over the many visits I've made to Vegas, I never intended to stay at Mandalay due to its location but because the room was comped and didn't feel like paying up to stay closer to the strip, I went with Mandalay.  

First impressions:  beautiful exterior and interior architecture throughout the property.  Attributes both theme and classic Vegas styles.  

Check-In

I arrived at the resort on a Friday late afternoon right around the time when check-in generally begins.  It wasn't as crowded as I was expecting so maybe I just got lucky.   The agent clearly directed my way toward the elevators and a few great tips and onward headed toward the room.

The Room

Before heading my way toward Vegas, I took a sneak peak at oyster.com website where it shows the actual picture of the room I had reserved.  Clearly, it seemed right on so I wasn't disappointed when I entered.  Nice layout and fairly spacious.  

The Gaming Area

Pretty spacious and large.  Seemed pretty ordinary compared to the other properties.  Definitely more high limit than others but that's definitely expected.  

Restaurants

Can't say at all because I didn't dine at any of the restaurants on-site.

... now, the negative comments

I love everything about Mandalay after my first experience, HOWEVER it's pretty far from the center strip area (4 corners--Caesars\/Bellagio\/Flamingo\/Bally's-Paris) area.  I really don't spend much time in the room unless I'm with a significant other :p  but besides that, I'm usually hanging out toward the center strip area so the walk\/cab ride is a bit unfriendly.  I also wish there was some sort of direct monorail system from Mandalay to City Center or to Bellagio instead of taking the tram from Mandalay to Luxor, walk across to MGM and take the tram from thereafter.  

So the question is would I stay there again?  Perhaps if I'm able to get it comped.  Location is far more important for me than the quality of the room or hotel.  I'd have to weigh all of the options then.

The Good:  Staff was courteous, extremely friendly, helpful and accommodating.  While checking in, I requested a strip view room, and received a strip view room; bonus points for Mandalay Bay.  The room appeared to be newly renovated, and was very comfortable. More bonus points.

The Inconvenience:  Was supposed to receive a $40 buffet credit at check-in.  Issue was promptly resolved the following morning after 5 minutes at the front desk.

Overall, I have nothing terrible to write about the Mandalay Bay.  I'm not certain I would stay here again, mostly because of the location. However, the tram that runs to the Excalibur saves time when venturing out on the strip by foot.",0,0,0

It has the best pool out of all the ones we visited, consisting of a fabulous wave pool, lazy river and a regular pool, this is by far the best part of the hotel (when you have kids).  The hotel looked amazing, with great room and was clean.  To top it off, it was easy to get uber\/lyft rides which is not something you can say at all the hotels in vegas.  Also to note, the hotel has direct links to the Excalibur and Luxor hotel in which you can either walk through the mall area or take a quick tram.  This is awesome when you want to visit the other hotels as it can be hot walking.  

Now for the negatives,I feel the eating options at the hotel are not very kid friendly (when compared to the other hotels).  Having a 9 year old i did not want a fancy sit down meal, but a place that is kid friendly.  The Buffet in the hotel is ""OK"", the food court is ""OK"" with limited options. There are a lot of restaurants, but they did not seem very kid friendly.  Lastly, the aquarium in the hotel is nice.  I see that all the individual attractions at the hotels are kinda small and the aquarium is the same.  It is nice, but nothing to write home about.  

So I would definitely stay here again, though if I had a kid I may consider another place for the food options, though the pool is the best we have been to.",0,0,0

Room was nice and we had a good view of the strip as a bonus.  The only strange thing was the way the bathroom is laid out - had walk in shower and a tub and a little room with a door contained just the toilet.  Kind of felt like going to the bathroom in a closet.  Checkin was fast and friendly.  Staff from M life desk to cocktail waitress to dealers were friendly.  Lots of dining options but most are pretty pricey.  We enjoyed the Noodle shop - very good if a bit pricey, the brunch buffet was excellent and breakfast would be a much better value at the buffet compared to Raffles Cafe which we tried for breakfast one morning.  The Burger bar restaurant was a disappointment as very pricey and while the burger was ok I would expect it to be among the best I've ever had but it was not.  The shark Reef was fun.  Did feel a bit like Disney with all the kids running thru the casino at times.  Apparently there were lots of kids tournaments the weekend we were here.  The Taxi stand was a bit disorganized the day we left for the airport and took forever to get a cab.  Overall a pleasant experience and we will be back.

Friends chose this hotel as it was the best priced option on Expedia with her points or something. Self parking was ok but hard to find a space that Friday evening. What we noticed, on each day, was that many of their parking structure escalators were NOT working. Meaning, tired people like us, and many others, had to schlep their luggage down flights of non working escalators (which is kinda scary). 

Check in was easy but crowded. There could have been more staff checking in patrons that holiday weekend. They have complimentary water in self service dispensers near by so that was appreciated (NOTE: a few times the water dispensers were empty and not refilled). 

They have designated elevators for three section of floors (it 1-12, 13-x, etc). Makes for quicker access to your floor.

Our room was clean with two queen beds. The room had a nice view of Luxor and the airport (if a view of airport can be even 'nice'). The beds were comfortable but we felt the pillows were too plush and too high. The bathroom had a shower, a tub, two sinks, and a toilet with a separate door. It had basic toiletries (conditioner, shampoo, soap, lotion).

The two closet space was nice. 

Huge con: NO COMPLIMENTARY COFFEE at all. No coffee grinds. Sad. 

The show ticketing area was nice and made it easy to book Cirque shows. Be aware there's like a $15 convenience PER TICKET even if you book a cirque show that's inside their own hotel.

Self parking is $10\/day but has in and out privileges. You can also park at any MGM hotel with that $10\/day fee (just use your room key). 

We ate at Lupo and Citizens at the hotel. Lupo was alright (birthday dinner) but Citizen's breakfast was spectacular.

You can find your final hotel bill using the guide feature on your TV. Made for easy reconciliation and dividing of costs among friends. 

Overall a nice stay.",9,4,4

We stayed at the sister-hotel, the Delano, at the time and had to use the pool facilities at the Mandalay Bay since the Delano apparently could not build their own pools. 

Anyway, we recently stayed at the Mandalay Bay and our experience was quite wonderful. We went on a weekday so the room was quite reasonable. We stayed in a Bay King room which had a large tub. My wife and I enjoyed soaking in the tub after a long day of running around. The room did not have a great view but the room was large. The casino area was not smokey-smelling like some of your cheaper hotels. 

My only complaint is the extra charges, including the parking situation. I have been going to Las Vegas for over 40 years and have always enjoyed the free valet parking. Now, the self-parking in $10.00 and valet parking is $18.00 plus tips. Com'on, really?!! You don't make enough money that you now have to charge the bullsh*t ""resort fee"" and ""parking""? Remember how they would give you complimentary in-room coffee? That's gone, too. You have to pay $4.50 for one cup of crappy in-room coffee (sigh!).",4,0,1

Mandalay Bay is huge, but not devastatingly so, like MGM Grand.  Our particular check-in employee was fantastic, combining our two reservations into one, so that we didn't have to change rooms each night.  She also hooked us up with a room that had a stunning view of The Strip!  The Mandalay Bay Beach is an impressive multi-pool area - lazy river, regular pool, beach club, etc.  Great if you love to swim or sunbathe!  Lots of nightlife here, too.

Our room was ALMOST perfect. Comfy beds, two closets, large bathroom. The casino paid out a good chunk of change to one of us playing video poker here.  There are a few drawbacks to this place, however:

1) The gym is just the Cardio Center.  It's a small room with a bunch of closely positioned treadmills and ellipticals.  No windows.
2)  The doors separating rooms offer ABSOLUTELY NO SOUNDPROOFING whatsoever.  We could hear people in the adjoining room EVERY night.  Everything.  Even just speaking at a normal-to-loud volume. We could even clearly see the light from their room shining into our own.  The first night, it was some obnoxious frat guys looking to party in Vegas and get laid (thank God they didn't get lucky).  We hardly got any sleep.  The next night, we could hear the new guests, too.  Security asked them to keep it down, but that didn't do anything.  We couldn't sleep until they went to bed at 3 AM.

FYI: In order to gain access to the Mandalay Bay Beach areas, EACH member must show their key card.

If you stay at this hotel, just be sure you're 100% okay with not sleeping until 3 AM every night.  That's a guarantee at this party hotel.",2,1,1

I booked 2 nights this past weekend and it was going to be my first time staying at Mandalay Bay so my boyfriend and I were very excited. I booked our room through the actual Mandalay Bay website. At check-in, we were told that our room would have 2 queen beds when I had reserved one king. They said that they were booked and that's all they had. They didn't offer any other accommodations and that pretty much we were stuck with a room we didn't want. We were upset since they had already charged the first night on my card and we would lose that if we cancelled. I asked to speak with a Supervisor and the employee simply said, "" ok, he will just tell you what I just said.""
I spoke with the Supervisor or Manager and at first he said the same thing but I after I kept trying to make my point, they told us that we could wait a few hours and when a room would become available they would change our room. They took down my number because all of a sudden a room had just became available but they needed about 40 mins to clean it. We waited more than 45 mins and no call back. I called the desk and asked about my room, a female employee said that they could not move us now since we had already checked in! OMG! I asked to speak with the manager and she said that he was on the phone and he would call me back. We were furious! I did receive a call back from another manager and he apologized for all the trouble and moved us to another room. Besides the halls reeking of marijuana and the walls being so thin that we could hear conversations, the room was ok. After freshening up, we went down to the casino in desperate need of a drink. We started to gamble and saw two cocktail waitresses walking by in a deep conversation. My boyfriend waived to them and they said, ""oh, yeah, yeah, someone will be with you,""  they also ignored another customer after us. Another waitress went by and she didn't even stop and told us she would be back...she also ignored the other customer. That customer looked at us and said, ""is that how it works? Isn't that why we come to Vegas? To play and gamble? I'm just going to the bar and tip the bartender...I'm sure he'll appreciate my tip."" 
Really? This place had the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED! The check-in trouble, the cocktail waitresses, the bath towels were hard, hardly any tv channels available, it was mainly casino advertising. Toiletries were not stocked after cleaning the room.

The first time we were in the main tower, and the last time we were at THEhotel.  Both have their good and bad points...but first, let's talk about the property over all.

The pool is obviously the best part of staying here.  Wave pool, lazy river, good music...it can be over-run with kids sometimes, but since one of these visits included my own child, I did appreciate the family-friendly vibe.  Even on my adults-only visit, I definitely didn't feel like the kids were hindering our ability to have Vegas-style fun.  The pool area also included a ""toptional"" pool for those who are into that sort of thing...though I have yet to check it out, I'm sure it would be one way to avoid a pool full of kids ;)

The Shark Reef aquarium is great, and was a big hit with the aforementioned kiddo.  Even mom enjoyed it.

The buffet here is meh...nothing to write home about...and the casino is equally meh.  

The rooms are nice in both properties.  We stayed in a standard room in the main tower, and were upgraded to a suite in THEhotel.  The suite was beautiful, but it was more space than we needed, and even further from everything we wanted to do.  No fun having to hike across the casino in our bathing suits to get to the pool every day. Also, the bedding was sort of unpleasantly rough and not what I'd expect in such a luxurious-looking room.  I definitely preferred the main tower room, and will decline the upgrade next time.

This review is SPECIFICALLY for front desk staff member RUTHE. 

Again: Ruthe. Heavyset African American woman (with cute hair I will mention) but it didn't help the chip on her shoulder. More of that shortly. But Ruthe needs to NOT be in customer service is the review summary. 

To begin I am a gold level on Mlife which has its own check in area for gold and above levels. My goal is to be platinum by the next visit! 

Booked a visit 4\/26-29 and have stayed here multiple times so I am quite familiar with standard procedures here. Today is the 29th and I booked late check out on the 16th when I made my reservation. Now I understand that sometimes wires get crossed with key cards and check out since less people use the late check out but my front desk experience has me questioning the ethics and professionalism of the Mandalay Bay front desk staff. 

My key did not work at 12:45\/1pm

At desk (on 4\/29 - any MB staff reading I implore you to watch the video footage). 

I mention key not working and that I payed for late check out. I add that I'm concerned someone was in my room. Mind you I am irritated that I am forced to return downstairs and yes, it showed. But I wasn't rude. Just irritated. She (Ruthe) gave me some sass and I sensed her impatience so I asked for management. Again: MB staff please watch the video. I requested management several times while she instead spoke over me and told me ""not to yell at her"" which of course I was not or security would have been there in an instant. I had to DEMAND management and instead of just getting me someone she decides to convey the entire issue to whomever was on the phone. I interrupt her and say that I can handle my own complain thanks. 

She then continues to give me attitude when I tell her that her job is customer service and her ethics are skewed. I say your in the wrong job and she responds with urban tone that I'm the one in the wrong job. Uh, what? I fail to see A) the logic in that response as well as B) why I deserved that rudeness? 

Management was nice. Apologetic. But as I'm explaining things Ruthe is behind him making severe facial responses to my words. Eyebrows high. Purses lips. Head tilts. All of it. So rude. I point this out to management and Ruthe replies that she is ""just standing there"". 

Bottom line I love MB but Ruthe is in the wrong job. She has poor customer service skills as well as a terrible attitude. I sincerely hope she is the one ringing me up at check out so she can either apologize like an adult and customer service representative or at lease see if her attitude changes or if it continues. 

So RUTHE - thank you for the opportunity to create a yelp. I was on the fence since I make have positive feedback but this experience needed sharing as it was so unpleasant.",5,12,2

There was a window over the bathtub that looked into the entry with seemingly no purpose other than allowing anyone standing on the entry side to see whoever was bathing. The toilet in the bathroom had a separate door but the main bathroom door was a slatted double door that opened to the bed so anything and everything could be heard. There wasn't a coffee maker so you have to either order room service or get dressed and publicly presentable to go get some. I usually like tea in the morning before going for breakfast but this was out.
The resort itself was nice but all but one of the pools were closed which is one of the main highlights. So it was quite difficult to find a place to sit at the one pool that was open. It may also be common in Vegas but it was impossible to find any place that was quiet and relaxing.",2,0,0

The main thing to consider about staying at the Mandalay Bay is its south strip location makes rather isolated from the rest of the strip.  This means its not going to be easy to walk to other properties or to simply check out the strip.  This also means cab rides are going to be a bit longer and a bit more $$$.   

If you want to be close to the action on the strip, you should consider staying someplace near the center strip, e.g., Ceasar's, Mirage, Bellagio, TI, Planet Hollywood, The Cosmo, Aria, etc.  You will have many more choices when it comes to gambling, dining, drinking, shopping, and whatever basically.  Proximity to better shopping could even SAVE you some money.  Case in point:  There are are a number of CVS and Walgreens stores near the center strip.  There are none I am aware of near the Mandalay Bay.  Should you need some sundries, you will pay a pretty penny at the small sundries shops in Mandalay Bay.  A person ahead of me was charged $15.00 for a pack of cigarettes, for example.  I then decided I didn't need anything from that shop that bad. 

I didn't find the on-site dining choices very compelling.  For me, this further drove home the point about this property being isolated from the rest of the stip.  If the on site restaurants are not to your liking, you are faced with a cab ride come meal time.  

Is using your own wheels a solution?  Not really.  To begin with, it's a pretty long trek through the casino to get to the the parking structure if you self park.  Then you've got to navigate the parking structure and go through basically the same process in reverse at your destination and do it again when you return to the Mandalay Bay.  If you're drinkin as folks are wont to do in Vegas, this isn't an option anyway.  

The rooms are nice enough, but probably a notch below properties like Wynn\/Encore and Palazzo\/Venetian.  

Check in took too long in my opinion (about 30 minutes) due to a line of people queued up at the registration desk.  Lots of empty terminals, though.  Spare yourself a repeat of this on the backend by using the mobile check out feature explained on the folder they give you with your room key cards.  

Housekeeping was a little aggressive on check out day and entered the room about 8:30 a.m.  It was an intrusion I could have done without.  

""Resort Fees,"" taxes, and taxes on resort fees are going to run you about $45.00 a night give or take depending on the price of the room, so be prepared for that.  

Despite all of the above, Mandalay Bay was a good choice for me this trip because it is an easy walk to the MGM Resorts Village.  I made the trip specifically to see the Slipknot show, so the location was an advantage to me in this instance.    

Despite all of the above, Mandalay Bay might be a good choice if its pools or a show are your reason for staying there.",1,0,0

It's not as grand as the Bellagio or the Wynn, not as lauded as Caesar's, but it's definitely got some good things going for it, especially from this local's perspective.

First of all, it's relatively easy to get in and out of.  Backways and sidestreets make for some sneaky routes.  (From Trop heading west - Koval south to Reno to Giles and you avoid the Strip altogether.)  This is good because it seems like there's always something going on here.  Whether it be a show at the House of Blues (one of the best venues in town), Rockstar Karaoke there, too, drinks with friends in furs at the Red Square, watching the wine-retrieving acrobatics at Aureole, grabbing a bite at the Burger Bar, or shopping at Mandalay Place.  (The latter is a good alternative to the sometimes hard to get to and always crowded Forum Shops or Canal Shops.)  Their pool, of course, is legendary.  There's none other like it in town.

I can deal with the tedious check-in process and shortage of towels (2 for the 4 of us!) but the add on expenses were too much.  I paid $130 for my family's access to the hotel water park... Total rip off.  Then they wanted to charge me another $100 for the tubes for the lazy river (don't do it... The 'river' is short, lame and crowded).
What really annoyed me was the overpowering smell (stink) in all the hotel's public places.  I am guessing they spray something to cover up the cigarette smoke.  It works for that but the resulting smell is nearly as bad.

Definitely had a great stay here this past weekend and it was a busy weekend, I must admit! (My friends decided that the weekend of EDC 2015 would be a good time to go). 

Despite the half naked ravers and believers of PLUR, we had an amazing time. The rooms we had were connected and both rooms had two king size beds. Each room had a toilet, two sinks, a shower, a bath tub, and a tv. 

In Vegas, you don't spend much time in your room. But after a long night of drinking and partying, this was a nice place to come ""home"" to. 

The view we had was of the Luxor. And it was such a nice thing to look at late at night. 

One thing I should mention is that they have self-parking. If you have the patience and the strength to wait and search and fight for parking, I would suggest that you take that route instead of valet. It is free. And plus, it is a great and safe place to leave your car for the weekend. Make sure to take out anything that can possibly melt. 

We often called the front desk to accommodate us with towels and such other things. And they were prompt and courteous. I was very impressed because at The Venetian, it takes forever to just get our luggage brought up. 

One con? Maybe the fact that it is kind of far from a lot of things on the strip. But other than that? Pretty good hotel. Will definitely consider this place again.",2,0,0

The casino is huge and seems to be more well ventilated than a lot of the others in Las Vegas - it's smokey to be sure but it's not so thick I feel like I can chew it. 

There are tons and tons of places you can eat here - a Noodle Bar, the Buffet, Lupo which is a Wolfgang Puck restaurant, an Asian-inspired restaurant, a steak house, a Cafe that serves healthy to-go sandwiches, donuts, and salads, and tons more.  If you walk to the aquarium there is a large food-court and there are many other food options there.  You can also walk from the Mandalay Bay to the Luxor directly through the shops at Mandalay where they also have more food and some shopping! 

The Michael Jackson ONE show is hosted here at this hotel and it's in a beautifully redecorated theater.  Mandalay also has a House of Rock I think - I've never been and so have only seen the outside - and some very nice gift shops that serve snacks and some essentials if you need them. 

The top 5 floors of this hotel are the Four Seasons Hotel (where we stayed on our last trip) and it's beautiful and connects nicely to the Mandalay Bay in hidden ways most people would probably never notice unless they utilized them - you can walk around the corner from the main Mandalay Bay guest check-in to get to a hallway and stairs that lead down to the Four Seasons - which has it's own entrance. 

I haven't used the pool at Mandalay - it's always been crazy crowded - but it's cool and large and has a lazy river (which I think you have to bring your own inner tube to or buy one there as they aren't provided) and a wave pool that looks awesome except for the 10,000 other people that are always in it. 

The casino has all the best and updated games as well as the typical hard-core gambling tables like Black Jack and Roulette.  I played Bejeweled nearly the entire time on a penny slot and ended up walking away with $1400 when I only started with $200!  Win! 

Mandalay Bay is really close to the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign - about 10 minutes straight walk or a 3 minute cab ride.  It's further down the strip past all the main hotels and a major intersection - there aren't so many cool things down by it aside from Luxor next door so most people don't venture down that far meaning it's quiet and not as crowded by any means - which is heaven if you spend the day on the main part of the strip and want to get away from the mass. 

It's our go-to place to stay.",3,2,2

Cons:
- We were specifically looking for a room with a jetted tub. When I called the concierge, she confirmed the 750 suite came with it. When we checked in, the tub was not jetted, just a large soaking tub. It was large enough for my husband and I to sit in cross legged, but not stretch out comfortably. Honestly, the spa tub I have in my master bath at home is more comfortable, can fit two people, and is also jetted. When I told the front desk at check out we were told by concierge that it did come with it, they only replied that they haven't offered jetted tubs in over a year. Be aware if you are looking for that or see anywhere that Mandalay offers it.
- Also, prior to using the ""soaking tub"", not jetted tub, my husband spent 5 minutes rinsing out all of the random hairs that were in it. Obviously, the cleaning crew does a sub-par job in the bathroom.
- Although the room was spacious, but not huge, it seemed clear to us cleaning a room just over 750 square feet was too tough for the cleaning crew as there was dust everywhere. There were months worth of dust on the bottom nightstand shelves, dust on the towel shelf in the vanity, dust around the tall lamp stand, dust on top of the long mirror entering the room, and random hairs on the pillows on the sofa. Needless to say, my husband and I didn't sit there.
- As soon as my husband opened the shower door, you could smell mildew. It was easy to tell that the smell was coming from the dirty drain. Although the shower looked remotely clean, we still wore sandals when showering.
- When we checked in, we told the lady at the front desk it was our anniversary, she seemed really nice and made it sound like the room she was booking for our special occasion on the 31st floor was going to be great. She said we would have a great view. She lied. She gave us a room directly across from the airport and we heard planes and jets taking off and landing all night.
- This ""wonderful"" front desk lady also booked our room right next to the vending & ice machine so every time someone came to get ice, we heard it from the bed.
- Speaking of the bed, it might have been a pillow top, but it should have been replaced 15 years ago. It was so soft and worn down that you sunk to the near box spring. It also squeaked every time you sat down to rolled over while sleeping. 
- You could easily see wear and tear on the furniture. The nightstands, dresser, and vanity all had chips. The corners of the toilet room looked dirty as well.
- The cream of the crop was waking at just after 5am to someone filling up their tub above us. It literally sounded like our tub was filling, which woke us up and got us concerned at first. A couple hours later, they filled it again so, needless to say, we did get the chance to sleep in. 

Pros:
- We booked spa treatments at Mandalay Spa. The spa area was nice. There were jacuzzi pools in 3 different temps, but the showers could use some scrubbing. See my review for the spa for more details. 
- We had lunch at The Fleur which was good. See my review on The Fleur for more details.
- The valet service was great! The delivered our truck quickly and the staff were all super nice.
- The bell hop that delivered our luggage was super nice. He had a great personality and even offered to suggest places for us to eat at.
- They provided a lot of towels for just two people.",3,3,2

I have always had a great experience at any of my stays at Mandalay Bay. I come to Vegas often (like twice a month) and when choosing hotels, Mandalay Bay is always my top choice. 

I checked in on Friday September 10th around 4pm and the lines weren't really busy. I always gamble at this hotel, so I am always instructed to check in at the Players Club line.  

The desk clerk was really nice and accommodating. In the notes on my account from the casino host, I requested a high floor with a strip or pool view and he was able to make that happen. I stayed on the 33rd floor with a view of the strip. He also noticed that my mom was disabled so he put us in a room that was pretty close to the elevator as well. 

I love Mandalay's rooms. Comfortable beds, really nice bathroom with tv, flat screen in the room, really good snacks (for a fee) (side note: you can go downstairs and right off the elevator there's a ton of goodies)

I did request bathrobes in the room, but when I arrived at the room, they were not there. I called the front desk and within 20 minutes, they had someone send up a pair. 

The pool area is really nice. Its great for kids, families and couples. They have various pools you can choose from (lazy river, huge pool in the west lagoon, wave pool and also Moorea Beach Club (for adults only!) 

Casino floor is huge! Tons of slot machines but spread out. (which is a good thing) I'm a baccarat player so the Salons at all MGM casinos are always up to par! The sportsbook is live as well. 

Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a 5 star hotel that you can relax, have fun, meet good people and get in some good gambling. I always said that if I moved to Vegas, and Mandalay was renting rooms, I'd stay here. :)",1,1,1

It was our first trip to Las Vegas in more than 27 years, but chose MBRC based upon recommendations and reputation. Overall, it was good, solid experience and we will definitely consider staying again.

We booked well in advance and received a very respectable rate. We received a couple additional, completely unnecessary emails reminding us of our upcoming visit - as if we could somehow forget. But I DID appreciate the email 24 hours ahead of our arrival which allowed us to fully check in before setting foot on the property. This then triggered an email a couple hours before our arrival with our room number and instructions for retrieving our room key(s( - without waiting in line. LOVE that option. Unfortunately, MBRC also managed to bill our credit card twice for the same trip, so I still had to visit the front desk to get the second charge reversed. Our room was also supposed to include complimentary valet parking... Didn't happen, management refused to honor it, and we wound up paying $54 to not drive our car for three days.

We found the hotel overall quite beautiful and well maintained. Our room was modern, clean, comfortable, and had NO stale or old cigarette smells. Our room was also VERY quiet - something we covet and cherish, so this was a HUGE plus.

Saturday morning, following a long\/late night of seeing the wonder that Las Vegas has become - we opted to order room service for breakfast. I was on hold for nearly 45 minutes before someone finally answered to take our order, and then it took another 35 minutes for it to be delivered. This needs to be improved. The food itself was quite good, which is a darn good thing given that a single three item omlet, hash browns and coffee came to $55. This included an undisclosed anywhere $9 service charge. This needs to be clarified up front.

For the remainder of our stay we tried several of the restaurants, say the Shark Reef and spent some time in the casino. Everything was just about as one would expect it to be - and it made for a good, overall experience. The elevators, aside from VERY slow closing doors, were prompt and reliable. Also, several of the in-house restaurants were closed this past week because it is ""off season"". This was not disclosed to us when booking, and we missed out on several locations we wanted to try.

Only a couple of knocks against MBRC...

First - Their signage leaves a LOT to be desired. This is a HUGE resort, and we found multiple times where directional signs were flat out wrong. This left us wandering around a fair amount the first couple days as we got our bearings.

Second - If, like us, you use myVegas or their mlife apps - disable all location tracking features in their various apps. They flat out, unequivocably were tracking our movements and essentially spying on us. While up in our room I was on the myVegas app looking to redeem some loyalty points for free play in the casino. The guidelines for so doing were unclear, so I went down to the mlife desk to inquire. By the time I got down there, all free play options were gone. So I trudged back up to my room and BAM!!! They were back. So I trudged back down to mlife again and BAM!!! Gone again. Then it hit me... Disable the location tracking features and BAM!!! Free play was back, even though I was in the middle of the casino. Clearly they were tracking my movements and selectively removing rewards which might actually come in handy. A similar scenario played out with Shark Reef and the Bayside Buffet as well. This needs to be improved. It is extremely petty that MBRC would feel the need to track our every movement and take away\/add rewards relevant to location.

Again, we had a lovely time - and none of the knocks were enough to spoil our weekend. But when one considers this was their ""off season"" and that it wasn't more than half full - those little things will become HUGE things during peak season.",1,1,1

On the 14th, our room was never turned down and we had to call the desk twice to get towels into our room. We weren't in our room very much that day and we didn't have the ""do not disturb"" sign on the door, so I'm not sure why we were skipped. When we checked in, there were only 3 large towels and 2 hand towels in our bathroom, which seemed pretty like a light quantity. I called about 4:30 get a few new towels so we could take a shower when we came back to the room before dinner. We got back at 6:00 and nothing had changed. We walked down to the desk to ask for towels and the woman at the desk was bewildered by my question ""could we get a few new towels in our room"". She looked at me like I had 2 heads. ""How many do you need?"" I said I didn't know, the usual. We just needed to get the old, wet ones out and get new ones in. ""But how many do you need?"" Whatever you normally do, I'm not really sure. We just need new ones because we don't have clean ones. Still confused, she told me she would have someone send some up. We got back to our room at 7 and it was finally stocked. Hand towels, face towels, medium towels and 11 large bath towels. We had a large stack in the bathroom and a large stack at the foot of our bed. Not sure if it was a joke or not. 

That night, after dinner, we ran a bath to relax. Bought a bubble bath ball, tossed it in and started the water. Water was filled, we turned off the faucet and there was a giant pubic hair floating on the top of the water. We hadn't been in the tub yet. It was pretty disgusting. Make me wonder what kind of cleaning is really going on inside the rooms. We never had an issue before, but this was a pretty disgusting find.

The air conditioning was not working correctly during our stay. Every time we got back into the room, I had to turn it down lower to get it to work. It said 67*, but it felt like 80*. The air in the room and our hotel was very hot and stuffy for all 4 days. Others we talked to also remarked how hot the hotel was, so I'm glad it wasn't just my imagination. Our AC would work for a while when we were in the room, but then would shut off, despite not getting down to the temperature it was set at.

To begin with, it's a hotel that has a casino. Outside of the Mandalay bay, they have a pool, which they refer as a beach for people that are sleeping in only. Their floor has games for gamblers, from the one penny machines to the black jack & poker. The main reason that I came here wasn't for the gambling, but to view a concert. When it was time to go see the concert, I thought that the concert was outside, but after following the signs, I found it. It was inside the building, making it perfect place for entertainment.

The staff is friendly.  But it's really not on the top of my list as far as casinos go.  Let's start with the good.  The pool is probably the best in Vegas.  Period.  The casino is high class. The rooms are great.  I like it here.  But with all the casinos in town, I usually don't think about coming here.  First of all, it seems to be far away or better yet, nothing seems to be close by.  Sure you got the Luxor and Excalibur, but both of those places just don't do it for me.  2nd, the shopping is better than most casinos but cannot match the Caesar's Forum or the Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes.  Third, other than gambling, there isn't something else to do. Fourth, the restaurant choices, while good, are not on the top of my must do list while in Vegas. Fifth, the shows here don't compare to the other great shows on the strip.  Sixth, the rewards program never seems to reward me.  Seventh, the hotel is expensive. I prefer staying mid-strip where all the action is and walking distance to a bunch of other activities.  Eighth, the odds seem worse here than other casinos.

Well not really, but for this end of the strip, I yield to Mandalay Bay the five stars for both obvious and the more subtle reasons...

Obvious:

- newly remodeled room to which we were upgraded and my one specific request: met at check-in without any hesitation
- ridiculously pleasant and personable front desk individual who obviously took genuine delight in the fact that we were there for the RnR running weekend
- same lovely front desk gal who was able to do an 11am check-in. Nice!
- wonderfully appointed room with separate soaking tub and shower
- gorgeous bedding, luxurious beds and brand new linens 
- ""there's something special about this room"" I find myself absent-mindedly thinking 
- casino area was not at all smoky and was enjoyably busy

Subtle:
- in Vegas, where everything is in-your-face, larger than life...I felt a calmness when walking the hallway to the room, and in the room itself 
- hallway colors and designs...then picked up, repeated subtly in room design: granite, art 
- opalescence, like butterfly wings...in the granite, pictured on the wall, the bed pillows, oh right...the carpet in the hall...it all tied together...that's the calming effect of good design. That's the ""what's special about this room."" 
- I appreciate that attention to aesthetic and it was so well-executed here: subtle but detailed
- and on a more service oriented note: two guys clearly performing housekeeping-related duties stopped (without request) and assisted me with the ice machine (coming off my fourth in a row running weekend & doing a true ice bath - they didn't know my story but they acted like this was all they cared about. Cool! AND ultimately, cold!)

The Bay itself is open limited months, so research obviously if you desire it. Many don't truly  understand that the desert gets cold...really cold. 

I'm actually pleased that the RnR half marathon start line is at this end of the Strip, otherwise I'd honestly never have chosen Mandalay Bay. (Despite one of my good friends' repeated urgings! His favorite.) Nice that I was highly satisfied and now a friend can ""I told you so"" me. 
He was right!

First off, the rooms are decent.  It's clean and the bathrooms are large, just like most places in Vegas.

However, my biggest complaint??  The toiletries SUCK!  The lotion is just so chalky and combined with the dry Vegas weather makes for lizard-like skin.  So please remember to bring your own lotion.  I wasn't too impressed with the shampoo and conditioner too.

Also, the bathroom door was so squeaky, you would think that the maids would have it fixed.

One night my room wasn't cleaned.  They did offer me a $50 food credit so I guess that made up for it.  I found out someone else's room wasn't cleaned either.

The pool area is gorgeous but can get crowded. I always get bad luck when I go to Vegas. I love hanging out by the pool. But last time there was thunder and lightening, so they ushered us out of the pool. This time around, the wind was pretty damn strong.  None the less, we had a good time.

In order to fully prepare myself, I decided to read all of the negative reviews that had ever been written about the resort. I always find reading the most critical reviews the most helpful when planning a trip and was prepared for anything and everything. Despite the resort's 3.5 review, we truly had a 5 star experience.

Early Check-in: 
To start, we arrived on Friday morning at 11am. We stood in a 15 minute line and were granted access to our room immediately. Chris at the front desk took great care of us and even warned us to beware of the mini fridge as items are time censored! Since we were all coming from the East Coast, we were so thankful that the hotel gave us the room so we could get settled in early and start our day!

Atmosphere:
The hotel is huge, but totally manageable. The rooms were lovely with super comfy beds, a large bathroom and a closet. Our only complaint with the room was lack of towels, but room service was extremely accommodating with giving us extra when we asked each day.

Pool:
The pools are awesome and there is something for everyone. Between a wave pool, lazy river and low-key quiet pool there's not much too complain about. I would however recommend bringing your own inflatable tube to avoid paying $20 for one at the hotel. In addition, it may be worth renting an umbrella as there is absolutely zero shade at the pool area.

Daylight: 
We had a ball here. Went to a Saturday pool party and unexpectedly had a blast. I'd advise getting to the party early and having your bags prepared (they don't allow outside food\/drinks, headphones - no clue why, pills (including prescriptions), tumblers, etc! In addition, as a girl they will hand out drink tickets upon entering for two free vodka drinks which is definitely a plus!

Food:
The hotel has a ton of awesome options for food. In addition, the prices are definitely fair and I appreciated that they didn't seem to price gauge. We booked our rooms through Travelocity and received $75 per room in credit which was nice. We applied this credit to our dinner at the hotel and thoroughly enjoyed the food and low bill!

Late Check Out:
Since we were coming from the East Coast, we decided to get late check out so we could spend a full last day at the hotel\/vegas. For $100 we were able to extend our check out until 6pm and use the pools and hotel for the rest of the day. When 6pm came we stored our bags with valet and spent the rest of the evening walking around the strip.

Overall:
I was shocked at how much I loved staying at this resort. We had the time of our lives and could not be more thankful for such excellent service that Mandalay Bay provided to us. Until next time Vegas!",5,0,2

The tram to and from Mandalay ends at night so if you're at a bar or a club somewhere on the strip you have to pay for a pricey cab ride back to Mandalay at the end of the night. The service is terrible. There is no concierge button on the phone so when you call the front desk and ask a question they say ugh that's concierge and transfer you after speaking to you in a bitchy tone. Housekeeping is awful. They do not clean the room every day. We had to call down for them to come because we were running out of toilet paper and clean towels. The claim to fame of this hotel is their pools and even those are not very impressive at all. There is a man made beach with a wave pool. The wave pool is lackluster because they are very, very stingy with the waves. There was maybe one wave every 5 minutes or so. The pool area gets very congested very early and the hotel is very unprepared for it. You have to get down to the pool around 8 AM if you expect to get a chair by the pool. Lame. The lifeguards are also very militant here. They'll sell you an alcoholic drink by the pool but you are not allowed to take that drink into the pool. Wtf? There were a few regular pools and jacuzzis. The lazy river is a complete joke. They do not rent tubes. They sell tubes for at least 25 dollars. We brought our tubes from NY. The lazy river is not lazy at all. It goes very, very fast and for whatever reason they allow people in the lazy river without tubes. So there's people walking in there and kids playing in there so people bump into each other all the time in there. It's not a relaxed lazy river at all. It was very congested and stressful because of how badly it's run. We had a deluxe room that was not deluxe at all. The bed was lumpy, the air conditioner didn't cool off the room much at all, the sheets had stains, and there was no dvd player. The only nice thing about the room was the flat screen tv. The elevators were a total mess. We were on the 23rd floor and for floors 17-34 there are only 6 elevators. There was always a huge wait for an elevator that could accomodate another two people. When we brought our tubes to the pool it took a half an hour to get an elevator with enough room for two people and two tubes. They also do not have any food that you can grab on the go. We had to walk through two other hotels to grab a quick sandwich on the go. Lame. The entertainment is very overpriced here. There was a Michael Jackson tribute at the House of Blues while we were there and it would have been 30 per person and that doesn't give you food, drink or even a seat! Needless to say we passed. If you pass through Mandalay Bay, eat at Burger Bar, check out the Shark Reef if you like to see fish but by all means do not stay here. It is a 1 star hotel that's priced like a 4 star hotel.",1,0,0

We booked the Bay Suite, and it was beautiful. I was pleasantly surprised to see it had been recently renovated. The bathroom featured a huge soaking tub, glass shower, and separate commode. The vanity area featured twin sinks and an extending make-up mirror. The soaking tub came in handy after a long day of walking. Grab yourself a bottle of wine, a bag of Epsom salt, then soak! 

The room had ample storage space in the closets, and even had drawers below the television. Two chairs near the window were nice, and gave us extra seating options. Our bed had bright white linens, and the bed felt like a cloud. 

I wish Vegas hotels offered complimentary water and a coffeemaker in the room. $4 to use the coffeemaker is ridiculous, especially with the $30 resort fee tacked on. You really can't spare some coffee? I would suggest bringing your own coffeemaker, unless you don't mind hiking to Starbucks in your pajamas. I guess I'm spoiled with Doubletree and Embassy Suites, which offer free water and coffee.

It's a decent hotel that's clean and the layout is little different from your typical Vegas hotels.  The service at the front desk was decent; the employee was really helpful when I had questions about rooms.

However, HOWEVER, there were a few things that were a bit aggravating.  

FIRST - They do housekeeping about 9am or so, but the maids are LOUD!  They're banging on a door and excessive door slamming.  (my door or another door) Since they were so loud they woke me up and I laid in bed, the maid opened my door and I guess noticed the room was still occupied they closed the door.  Mind you, the door hanger that says private was showing.  The following day the same thing happened again.. loud banging and doors slamming.  Kind of hard when you're trying to sleep in.

TWO - I wanted to inquire some information from Guest Services, but it took a few minutes for me to get a hold of someone.  From my experience in the past, on your room phone you dial ""Guest Service"" and there is no ringing and someone picks up right away.  

Mind you I didn't stay during peak season.

The decor outside in the hallways is nice except for the carpet. Why would you spend so much to make a hotel beautiful then ruin it with clown carpet? 
As far as food is concerned..their buffet has gotten so bad over the years and if one doesn't want the buffet...there is a very limited selection of morning fresh baked goods in the cafés. If you charges so much to stay there and are at the furthest end of the strip...the least you can do is have decent food selections that isn't days old or places that are more casual where food has not been sitting there a while.

Okay so let's start off from the beginning. We did a late check in (completely my fault I had a pre-birthday dinner with my family and we didn't end up getting there till 12am) originally we had a suite but because it was a comp room and there was an event at the hotel we got downgraded to a deluxe. 

So that was a big bummer to my boyfriend but I thought the deluxe was amazing and very spacious!!! The bed was favorite part because they had layers of blankets and a heavy but cool one (which is what I like) and the view was nice! Especially at night when the strip was lite up.

But lucky there's another door that leads to the toilet and there's a button lock so yay!

When we checked out the next day, we stopped by the front desk to pick up our receipt so we could present it at the pool to enjoy for the day. We get to the pool, find 2 spots and settle. For whatever reason, I reviewed the receipt, which I never do!, but will now always do moving forward. That's when I saw we were overcharged by over $1100!

The girl helping us had no business handling a guest issue of this magnitude and I asked for the MOD on multiple occasions. Unfortunately, not only did she (the MOD) not come out until 5 minutes before we walked away, but she also handled it horribly. It soured our taste and we ended up not staying very long after. We loved MB prior to this and always took advantage of being a M life member, but our experience the second night in Fremont was 1,000 times better. I still can't believe I'm saying this! But I truly hope you provide your front desk with better training on how to handle those situations. Unfortunately, we won't be going back to find out. 

Please note - this review is 100% on the front desk and customer service. 

The casino including the tables and bars we went to Friday night were top notch per usual. We will go back there, just won't be staying anymore.",0,1,0

The casino, restaurants, convention center, and rooms are all the rave, if not more and is quickly rising amongst the ranks as one of the top destinations in Vegas.

The place seems very European for what is supposed to be Southeast Asian themed.  Regardless, the place seems to get a lot of visitors in this South end of the strip location, separating itself from similar competition like Caesars further up north.  Only 3 years old, ""THEHotel"" has some of the most scintillating suites and rooms few people can match and is worth the hype and costs a pretty penny to rent out for the night.

This is also the location where ""Las Vegas"" on NBC is shot.  On any given weeknight glimpses of Josh Duhamel and gang can be seen practicing their craft in the closed off area of the casino \/ lounges.  Its a fun place to be but a very exclusive one as well.  The service I've encountered has been somewhat pretentious and snobby, which pales in comparison to its superior service friendly MGM sister properties.  Its a shame really, because this is the best MGM property of the bunch.",0,0,1

I came on a comp. night but stayed an additional night. There is a resort fee of $25. Resorts fees sucks but take advantage of it since you're already paying for it. (Even the Caesars Entertainment hotels are charging fees now). Where is the petition that I need to sign against this?!

So I was able to check in early at no extra cost, around 1:45pm. The front desk rep. was just great. Since it was my first time staying there, she took the time to walk me through the map she gave me.

Warning: I chose the partial Strip view room on a high floor... and it was okay. Depending on where the room is, I saw mostly the airport and a little bit of the MGM hotel and Luxor's sign.

The room was nice and clean. In-room service was good. But if you want breakfast in the morning, call ahead and place an order the night before or call an hour before when you plan to have your breakfast. Be prepare to wait 45 min - 1 hour wait, and it was a Sun\/Mon mornings. I can only imagine a busy weekend.

The standard rooms were nice but the wave pool was the best! The lazy pool is nice to relax in with a tube (~$20).

From the moment we arrived the service was awful!! I booked the rooms well over 6 months ago and asked for adjoining rooms, since there were six of us total with 2 of us in each room. My request was not granted. We gave all of our luggage to the bellman when we arrived, once we got to our rooms we called the number on the ticket to have our bags sent up, and to my disbelief the bellman just left all of our bags and luggage in the middle of the hallway, I couldn't believe it!!

The next day I booked a couple's massage for one of my bridesmaid's and I to enjoy a relaxing massage together. Geo was my massage therapist and he was amazing! I would be giving the massage five stars, but due to poor layout planning of the hotel our massage room was next door to the gym so every couple minutes we were startled to weights being thrown down onto the floor. Definitely not worth the $160 I paid to not even be able to relax!!

After our massage, I met up with some of my other bridesmaids for a late breakfast at the Sea Breeze cafe. I ordered a cappuccino and was given a black cup of coffee I had to return, my friend ordered a bowl of greek yogurt with berries and had to return it because it had moldy strawberries in it, and my other friend was charged twice for one Bloody Mary, not to mention the incredibly slow service we received the entire time.

We booked a beach gazebo cabana which was nice, but I was highly disappointed with the lazy river. It's one small loop, and it's filled with kids. If you're looking for a 21 & over pool with good music, this is not the place to go to.

Now for the kicker. The real bachelorette celebration was to begin Saturday night. My Matron of Honor and I booked everything through the Mandalay concierge about 4 months prior to our trip. The main event was the Thunder From Down Under show at the Excalibur we were supposed to attend at 9pm. My matron of honor had received the itinerary awhile back confirming all of our booked reservations including our Thunder show tickets. She checked in with the concierge to pick up our tickets and she was told they were being held at will call at the show. So when we finally arrived for the show, she was told our show ticket dates were for June 16th and not July 16th!!! So our table wasn't reserved and they had a sold out show!! The 2 girls at the counter were giving my girl a really hard time, but luckily the manager stepped in and gave us tickets for the 11pm show with a VIP table like we had originally booked, only we were at the very end and not in the middle like we had originally purchased and he took 50% off the original ticket price. Just knowing now that the concierge can't be relied on to book the right dates for shows is reason enough for me not to ever come back here, the whole night was almost completely ruined behind this.

I give Mandalay one extra star because the standard rooms were nice and the bed was comfortable. We ate at Lupo's Saturday night and the food was amazing!! But those 2 reasons are not strong enough for me to ever stay at this hotel again. I go to Vegas a lot, and with all of the options you have to choose from, I will never stay here again, nor will I recommend it to any of my friends. 

I let the manager know at the end of our stay know about the poor service we received all weekend and he credited back $50 per night to each room, so at least we were given a little something back.",1,1,1

With my particular experience though, I can't say I'm a fan even though I was sure this would be my favorite hotel. I'm in the middle.

The good
-Smells fabulous -- no smell of smoke anywhere! I love the smell of suntan oil and summer, and this is exactly what you can expect to smell.
-Really easy to navigate. Yes, it's still as massive as all the other resort and casinos in Vegas, but it didn't take us that long to figure out where everything was. The room layout is really nice too, so you're not wandering for miles and miles on end.
-Staff was all really nice and check-in and out was REALLY efficient. This is nothing compared to the freaking Aria who I'm still convinced has the worst check-in known to man.
-AMAZING tub. Baths are my fave, especially after walking around all day. This tub didn't disappoint at all and there's room for two..(sorry, was that TMI?)
-It's extremely far South. We knew that before going but hadn't got to see the South end of the strip, which is why we chose it. The tram that runs between Excalibur and Mandalay will help you get to the center of the action pretty quickly.
-There's a cheap liquor store close. Go South on the strip toward the Four Seasons and there's one in the complex with Panda Express and McDonalds.

The meh
-Baths are one of my favorite pleasures, but where's the bubble bath or bath fizzies or something? Not even a thing of shower gel to improvise.
-The slot machine ate my $3.45 voucher. I was prepared to let it go since it was such a small amount of money, but the lady that worked there said that it was my money and she would get it back for me. She talked to her sup and worked it out for us. It started out bad, but she made it better.

The bad
-The room keys are extremely sensitive. Don't put the key anywhere in the same vicinity as a cell phone, credit card or anything that could affect the magnetic strip. If you can carry two purses or two wallets, do it (just joking) We had to walk downstairs 3 times to get our key cards reactivated. One of the times, we carried the cards in our hands not putting them near anything and they still didn't work. Luckily, the last time we walked downstairs the keys FINALLY worked because I was irate and it takes a lot to make me mad. 
-Our toilet hardly ever worked. It was about every 3-4 flushes before it would actually flush. This is something I've come to expect back at home in my ghetto apartment but not in a 5-star hotel.
-The last day we were there and on our way to checkout, all of the doors were closed and some other people told us that the elevators weren't working and the alarms were on. It worried us because we had no idea what was going on and weren't alerted of any potential security or fire issue. Yikes.
-Limited access to cheap grub. We spent most of the time taking the tram or bus to other hotels to find something in our price range. There's not much within Mandalay, but you can go to the complex I mentioned, the food court at Luxor or navigate down to NY-NY which has a lot of awesome cheap food. Just be warned though that you will have to do some walking to get to it.
-Resort fees. Can this Las Vegas standard just go away? Mandalay's is one of the most expensive ones weighing in at $25 per day plus tax..4 nights at Mandalay tacked on an extra hundred bucks and change. I will continue to put this under negative until the powers at MGM Resorts set the standard and get rid of these frivolous charges.

I may or may not stay at Mandalay again. I'm still perplexed by the entire experience and wish that things would have been better for me. Of the three MGM hotels I've stayed at so far (Aria, Mandalay Bay and New York-New York) I'd probably pick Aria or NY-NY due to convenience, location and overall experience over Mandalay Bay.",4,1,1

This was kind of a last-minute decision to book A room here. There was an event going on and we decided to just get a room instead of going back to her hotel after the event. 

Check in was very nice and smooth they actually upgraded us to the top floors that are operated by the four seasons Hotel it's a little bit more private and exclusive up there and they gave us what they call a premium of you which looks over the pool. The hotel itself is big I noticed that there were a lot of kids in the hotel they do have the aquarium I don't know if that's why there were so many kids. They have a -5 ice bar which is something to experience if you've never done it before. 

While we were here we ate at areole. The bayside buffet. The house of blues. My cousin picked up a snack at the sports book grill he said it was pretty good and cheap. The Bayside buffet had all you can drink champagne and I made the mistake of starting the all you can drink champagne at 9 o'clock in the morning and I ended up having to go back to the room and lay down because I wasn't feeling too good. 

So the pools are the main reason that we came here. I had no idea how big the pools were until we actually saw the view from our room. There are multiple pools on this complex there is a full wave pool there's a waterfall there is a lazy river it is absolutely incredible. In my opinion it's actually overwhelming. We ended up doing daylight beach which was extremely crowded on the weekend and we left pretty quickly. We have that up hanging out at Mori which is more of a quiet pool adults only. The regular pools had a ton of kids around them. I don't mind kids but they were throwing balls and screaming I kind of just wanted to relax. I will still never understand why parents bring their kids to Vegas. I found a great beach bar that has $50 drinks and when you bring the drinks back they fill it up for $12. 

The only real downfall about the Mandalay Bay is that it's towards the end of the strip. You can walk to the Luxor but if you're young like me most of the action is towards the middle to the other end of the strip. Mandalay reminded me more of a family resort. Which is really cool if you're into that sort of thing. 

Overall or stay at Mandalay was pretty nice I have no complaints I still don't understand why people bring their kids to Vegas but if you are going to bring your kids to Vegas I would think Mandalay would be a great place because the pools are amazing.",8,4,5

The slots usually pay out well between 3am-6am for some reason.  Rooms are nice, and the event center is nicely done as well.  It can get a bit noisy between 11pm-3am, but fun times abound.  There's also a small shopping mall which connects to the Luxor on the other end with an Urban Outfitters in it.

To begin, let me say that I did not stay as a hotel guest. I have a second home in Las Vegas. 

There are many resort properties on the strip. You could visit one property per month, and it would still take more than a year to visit them all. And I do enjoy visiting these resort properties to dine in one of their restaurants, to have cocktails, gamble a little, explore the property--maybe catch a show. I had not visited the Mandalay Bay in a while, so I decided to revisit and see what changes may have taken place since my last call.

One of the things that I noticed as I drove into the parking garage was the new (to me) parking gate and ticket dispenser. I didn't really think about it, as my plan was to have dinner at a new restaurant on site.

After finishing dinner, and paying my bill, I learned that the restaurant did not validate parking tickets. The first hour of parking is ""free"". As I had completed my meal within the first hour, I decided to leave. 

I guess the hotel really doesn't want ""locals"" to visit and spend money. I'm not sure why: I visited mid-week, and the parking garage, hotel property and restaurant were practically empty.

I can understand if the resort wants to charge parking for those who visit--but who do not spend money. But in my case, I spent $100 on dinner and cocktails. And I would have spent more on the property, had I stayed longer.

According to an LA Times articles (19 Jan, 2016; ""Say goodbye to free parking at Aria and 10 other Las Vegas properties""), the properties owned and managed by MGM are the only ones charging for parking as of now. I am simply writing to express my opinion, in case the management of [any] of the resorts on the Strip wonders what the public thinks.",1,0,0

I was scheduled to fly to Las Vegas on Monday and on the Friday prior I called the hotel with a couple of questions at which time they confirmed my reservation and everything seemed fine.

At 7:30 pm the night prior to my departure from New York to Las Vegas, I received an email from the Mandalay Bay stating the conference block had been overbooked and I was being relocated to the Four Seasons, which is attached to the Mandalay Bay, but entirely separate from the MB (read my Four Seasons review as they are a true lesson in quality service).  I was advised my room and tax would be charged by the Mandalay Bay and the resort fee would be charged by the Four Seasons.  I checked into the Four Seasons without an issue.  

After settling in, I went to the Mandalay Bay to walk around.  I signed up for the MLife card a couple of weeks before arriving as the concierge suggested I do so for additional perks during my stay.  I went to the desk and got my card.  I played a while on slots, but didn't have much luck so I went to dinner at one of their restaurants. 

One night after daily meetings, a few people also attending the conference suggested we have dinner and walk the strip.  They went to the MLife desk to get their card and after a few minutes of the clerk explaining rewards, etc, they were all comped towards a meal. As I was standing to the side waiting, they told me to get my card comped because I was with them and the conference.  The clerk asked me if I were a guest at MB and I said I had a reservation, but was shifted to the Four Seasons due to overbooking, but I was part of the conference.  She said ""I can't do anything for you because you are not a Mandalay Bay guest.""  It was embarrassing and she was quite dismissive.  I did not press the issue; I just said OK and took my card back.  

I was scheduled to check out on Friday, December 4th. On the Wednesday prior, I had a private matter come up and needed to change my stay and check out on Thursday and catch an evening\/overnight flight home so I could be home for a personal reason Friday afternoon.  I checked out of the Four Seasons on Thursday morning (very early as I had a full day of conference sessions) and they adjusted the reservation on their side and advised me to tell the MB of the change.  I called the front desk of MB and explained the situation and was told I would have to still pay for the last night, Thursday, a night I would not be staying.  I had already checked out and the FS offered to store my bags for the day.  The MB person on the phone kept saying he understood my problem, but it was policy and I would be charged for a room Thursday night even though I checked out at 7:30 am on Thursday morning.  I was going to be charged room and tax for a night I would not be there.  Then I looked at my bill and the MB had also charged a resort fee.  I advised that Four Seasons was charging the resort fee and was told that was different.  I advised them I should not be charged a resort fee when I am not actually staying at the resort and where I was staying was also charging the fee.  I asked to speak with the concierge.  The concierge, another person who was very dismissive, told me I needed to contact reservations who then turned around and told me to call the concierge.  I finally emailed guest relations and explained the situation again and said I was planning to contact the corporate offices regarding the charge as well as how poorly I had been treated.    Within 5 minutes I received an adjusted bill.  There was still a resort fee on it, but I pointed it out and it was removed.

I am an extremely patient traveler as I have been traveling for business for over 16 years.  I stay at many hotels and have minimal expectations (reasonably-priced, clean and safe). Never in my 16 years have I felt so unwelcome at an establishment.  From the overbooking to the issues I had with cancelling the last day, my view of the MB has been tarnished and I will not ever stay with them or any affiliate nor would I recommend staying.  

The Good
The Orchid is good for continental breakfast at a reasonable price in the morning.

Border Grill is exceptional.  Happy Hour has good deals.

Conference facilities are very well-appointed, although some areas are under construction, but the rooms are very cold so if you are there for a conference, be sure to dress warm.

Security staff are very helpful and friendly.

The Bad
Food is expensive; even the food court.  $14 for a slice of pepperoni pizza and a medium Pepsi.  $5 for a water.  

Slots are tight.  Little to no payouts\/bonuses.  

Drinks from the floor are free (tip the waitresses as they are good) but I suggest getting a beer as the cocktails are not the best.

Wifi is terrible.  I was only able to connect as a guest and it kept dropping the connection.",5,2,3

My hubby and I spent 4 days on the middle of the strip, boozing, gambling, and committing other forms of debauchery.  We then spent two days down at Mandalay Bay to recoup and detox. 

Mandalay is a beautiful hotel with great in-room amenities.  Large bathtub, glass shower, and WC.  in addition, the restaurant choices are extensive.  

The pool is a large draw here, as other people have raved, so I don't feel the need to.  Let's just say, even as an adult, I enjoyed the wave pool and lazy river!  

So the drawbacks.  
1) There is no adult only pool unless you want to pay to get into the topless one.  I love kids, just not after a 4 day bender in Las Vegas.
  
2) All the restaurants close early.  After my hubby and I woke up from a nap (passing out) at 10pm we couldn't find anywhere open and walked to McDonalds (ugh).  

3) It is SUPER far away from the main area of the strip.  I made the mistake of staying down here one year and I ended up spending hundreds on taxis and even more on my poor feet.  If you are in Vegas to Party, stay farther down on the strip.

Mandalay is beautiful and very resort like.  It just depends on what you are looking for.  If you are bringing kids, this is a great option.  If you are looking for some R&R, this will also fit that bill.  However, if you are staying here expecting to make and quickly forget some bad choices, probably not so much.  Stay down towards the middle of the strip.",2,1,1

The bedding was bad, oh it was clean, it was just sort of cheap and trashy looking to me. Everyone seems to be hung up on rooms needing to have a flat screen TV and an ipod dock, wireless internet, basically all the latest technology, so if you're into that, it has that. I don't need any of that in a hotel room so it didn't make or break my impression of the place. The overall resort ameneties as far as bars, casino, restaurants, check-in, that is all fine.

Plenty of the penny slots with the mini games for those who don't like to lose their shirt gambling, but would like a steady flow of free alcohol.  The Sportsbook is nice, plenty of screens, though I do wish the seating was more comfortable.  

Got to the room.  Nothing impressive, but still clean.  Beds feel like typical motel beds.  I guess i'm used to the awesome Heavenly beds from the Westin chain of hotels.  Nice bathroom with the water closet.

The next morning we get to the pool.  Gotta say  this has to be the best pool area in Vegas.  The wave pool is a nice change of pace from other bland Vegas pools.  It's up to 7 feet deep, and the water doesn't look like its home to Swamp Thing.  Every 2-3 minutes there is a good size wave.  Not quite as many waves as I would prefer, and I would like to see bigger waves, but cool nonetheless.   

Next to the wave pool is a lazy river.  The Lazy river is in a shadier area, which is nice on those 100+ days where you need to get out of the sun.  My advice is to grab a inner tube and a beer, ignore the 'No drinks in pool' rules (the lifeguards don't seem to care), and go for a cool, leisurely float around the river.

We had absolutely no running water. We were only here for one night so we weren't able to switch rooms, we just didn't have time. So I when I got their survey via email after I got home, I wrote about my experience. They were SO apologetic and completely comped my room. 

So, this year, I took my assistant to Vegas as a going away last horrah, and I figured Mandalay bay was one of the most Vegas-y options since she hasn't ever been. Because they were so helpful with correcting the problem I had before, I thought I'd give them a shot. 

Mistake. 

The service is okay, people are pretty nice but they should be so I don't give points for that. The room was hardly ready when we checked in. No glasses, and no room service menu (Sunday morning in Vegas with no room service is like painful). There was someone above us doing god knows what and making so much noise. 

So nothing horrible happened, but it's irritating when you're paying a premium for a room and little things keep going wrong. 

I don't know why I stray from Encore. I just figured with Mandalay's killer pool, this would be a more ""fun"" place for someone who's never been to Vegas.",1,0,0

A couple of colleagues and myself walked to the Mandalay Bay from another resort \/ property located on the strip, and it was a pleasurable walk.  Once we arrived, it took us a moment to figure out where we were going, but we made it to the lobby \/ front desk area to check-in.  We were attempting to check-in around 3pm or so in the afternoon and the desk appeared to have way more available computers \/ lanes than was being utilized, thereby causing a delay in the check-in process.  Myself and many of my colleagues received upgrades to suites, and mine was absolutely stunning!  It was a two bedroom suite, with each bedroom being equipped with a King bed, it's own restroom, then two separate sitting areas when you first enter the room.  I thought it was a ""special"" room as I started my walk down the long hallway, realizing that the two door entrance at the end of the hall was mine.   The room that I utilized during my stay had stunning views overlooking the Mandalay's pool area, the Strip, and McCarran International Airport.

The rooms were very spacious, clean, and comfortable.  I was having a challenge with one of the TVs in the room, called down to Guest Services, and the situation was remedied in a timely manner.

A short walk from the lobby area through the casino put you in the food court, where we dined during our first night at the Mandalay Bay.  The food court had numerous eating establishments including Citizens Kitchen and Bar which my colleagues and I dined during our first evening at the Mandalay Bay.

Main reasons for only 4 stars rather than 5 is because we didn't get turn down service and the buffet sucks.  We stayed in a suite and we are supposed to get turn down service with two bottles of water on a nightly basis. We didn't get it unless housekeeping caught us in our rooms in the evening.

The room is comfortable and has a very modern aesthetic. 

A couple of small things are keeping this from a four star review. 

1.) The pool is beautiful but when we were there in July it was so incredibly crowded that it was difficult to find pool side seats. The lazy river was so full of people trudging along that it ceased to be both lazy and a river; it was more like rush hour on the way to a factory job. Also, the pool doesn't have umbrellas available for you unless you pay for a cabana, and we didn't choose this option (it's way too pricey for just two!). The other thing that such a nice pool brings is a large number of kids, so keep this in mind if you choose Mandalay Bay in the summer.

2.) I had a pair of earrings stolen from the room. I know, I know, keep them in the safe. It's my fault for leaving them out, but still ...  After I called to report them missing, they did send up a very nice and helpful security person, but there was really nothing he could do.

And there is real sand that was trucked in, which is (of course!!) pleasing to the senses. The only problem with the sand is -Las Vegas's climate is scorching hot, and there is little to no shade on the beach, so their sand stays extremely hot. Wear water shoes to the wave pool and lazy river for comfort & safety. This is one time you might invest in a cabana, but only if you go with a group, cause they are VERY pricey. The red padded lounge chairs alone cost around $100\/each\/day. Jacuzzi is enormous! There is a beachside (indoor, AC) casino. You can wear your swimsuit there, and even the dealers wear beach attire. 

From May through September, the wave pool is transformed into a stage at night, where concerts headline big names. You are literally standing in the water for the concert, or you can sit on the sand, poolside. Bathing suit attire preferred, but if you're not planning to get yourself drenched, shorts are okay. Lol. I attended a couple of concerts, one of Chris Cornell's, *swoon*, while standing mid-calf-deep in cool water, drink in hand, a fun and raucous party in the pool. Really nice atmosphere. It was so relaxing and was very welcoming to be cooled off and get some relief from the 100+ degree heat. House of Blues also is located inside Mandalay, on the casino level. House of Blues is a pretty nice venue. The ladies rooms are gilded. Speaking of pools, most hotels in Vegas in general, are completely closed during the Winter season, so keep that in mind.

The wave pool by day is cool. The lifeguards posted  25' above the wave pool, at the end of the approx. 9' deep water, won't let you drown. Lol. There are -count them- 6 of them, watching over any drunk fool(s) who might not respect the power of the very strong hydraulics of the wave pool. You must be 48"" tall in order to enter the wave pool. The wave pool at Mandalay bay is a ton of fun in the sun. 

You'll find Mandalay Bay is one hotel that has a lot of rules, but they're in place for your own safety. Just note they are more strict with their rules than others on the strip. Pool closes at 7pm at Mandalay.

NO DRINKS ALLOWED in the lazy river, and the lifeguards have serious attitude about it if you have a drink in your hand. This is where I feel they should loosen up their rules a bit: no outside drinks (including your own bottle of water), coolers, or other outside food are allowed in the pool area. You can only walk in with your towel, and a small bag to carry essentials. And yes. They do check inside your bag as you enter, ladies. They should at least let you bring in your bottle of water. I think it's just silly.

There's a nice poolside cafe that has hot and cold snacks. I highly recommend the crispy chicken fingers. You don't have to go across the U.S. Border to get great Mexican food at ""Border Grill"", cause it's right across from the lazy river. You also might want to try ""The Burger Bar"" for one of the best burgers I've ever had, and save a lot on drinks with ""Fat Tuesday's"", cause you can get a refill lol in various locations scattered on the strip.

Absolute worst experience I have ever had in Vegas.. I was so upset by the managers treatment to me. I am 20 and was in Vegas a little too late to feel safe driving home so I decided to call this hotel since it is where I have stayed with my family every time I went to Vegas. I will never come back or recommend this hotel after the kind of treatment I got. not relaxing at all; a complete utter disaster... :(  

The story is that I made the reservation at 10 o clock (after Zumanity) because there was a drive back to Saint George I didn't feel safe driving in due to fatigue. 

When I spoke with the representative she said there was a room available and that it would be 270.00 for the night I said that would be fine and she went ahead and asked my billing address and the name for the reservation.

After she took my information she asked for my card information and I gave all this to her.

next she told me when the pool etc. closed and that I need to be 21 to check in and that is where I had the problem and told her I was 20. She put me on hold for 15 minutes and then I got with a manager who was a complete power struggle. He stated to me that due to the nature of their policy they can't refund any reservations made without a 48 hour notice and since it is well within that time period he is going to extend a special offer of refunding half the money if I cancel the reservation now or I need a 21 year old to check me in... this was completely disrespectful of my time and money.. he stripped me of any bit of happiness I could have felt. 

I was trying to be responsible and stay off the roads at such a late hour and either way I was paying premium money to stay there. 

** not to mention I have stayed here before and had no problem even at 19 when I walked in..

At this point in the story I was given the option to get half the money back and have no room or have a 21 year old check me in which both me and my girlfriend didn't have..

why this wasn't explained to me before I gave her my card is completely wrong and for them to offer half my money back for a reservation I was still on the phone for is completely ethically wrong.. 

Both me and my girlfriend rushed off to the hotel to try and figure something out regardless of the fact that we were supposed to have a nice dinner and relax. This took a while to get to the hotel since we had to walk and take the tram etc. 

When we got there we went up to an agent and went through the check in process to see if they would just check us in. We got through just fine even though I handed him both my card and ID.

The manager seriously ruined our night and gave me anxiety I have never felt before.

We get to the ruin and are ready to go to sleep after a completely stressful night. ** we are still hungry but sick to the point where we can't eat..

the doorbell rings and ** THE DOOR IS SET TO DO NOT DISTURB
it's the maid and she has a note that says alcohol\/food.

at this point I don't feel like I am ever going to be able to relax because now she is up here and disturbing peace that I played a lot for!!!

she comes in our room when my girlfriend is in her underwear lying in bed so I am very bugged that we can't relax AT ALL!!

there is no wet bar in our room so there isn't any alcohol. unless somehow it is in the locked fridge looking thing under the sink..

the maid can't figure it out so in her rightful mind she decides to take all the snack bar type things IE: Fiji water, mom's, pretzels, etc. BASICALLY ANYTHING WE COULD HAVE HAD.

WOW THIS WAS HORRIBLE

***THE SERIOUSLY TOOK MY MONEY AND MY HAPPINES AND RUINED OUR PLANS FOR DINNER FOR NOTHING!!!!!!

I WILL NEVER SEND ANYONE YOUR WAY OR EVER COME BACK EVEN THOUGH I USED TO LOVE THIS HOTEL.

YOUR ETHICS HAVE WASHED AWAY!!!


**When I called in today to talk to a manager I was offered a pitiful 28 dollar refund to my card WOW!!

He said since I had stayed in the room that's all he can do.. I would normally understand this but considering my options of if I would have canceled the room and not stayed in it I would have lost almost 150.00 and still not have a room or make it work and find a way to stay whether that is paying someone to check me in at 21 or hopefully when I get there they would just check me in... I didn't have much of a choice..

Something must be done because the stress you have caused is astronomically high and to top that I paid for the stress and anxiety in this case!!


**update

they got back with me over email

I appreciated their assistance in making this situation right with me! What happened to me was an experience that is rare. I have been many times and loved every time.

Unfortunately my first room was a connecting room and the people staying next door decided to come home at 7am and argue for 20 minutes, not a great way to wake up my first morning. After I called down to the desk things settled down until about 8:30 when they made up and were rather load while having sex. At this point I hit the buffet and asked the registration desk for a new room. 

After the clerk laugh about my experience he said they wouldn't have a room until later he took my name and told me he could only hold the room until 2 and he would call me when it was ready. Basically stay on the property or lose the room and we can't tell you when it will be ready. 

At 2 I went back to the front desk, they couldn't explain why they didn't call but try did have a room. 

Unfortunately the beach and the beach side casino were closed. They only had one pool open which was full of screaming kids, not for me or as implied on their web site, it just says the beach is open seasonal, since it's 70 out I assume that's good beach season.  

As for the restaurants they had 5 of them closed for renovation again not noted on the web site (red square, china buffet, Lilly, red white and blue and another one that escapes me now) also the food court was closed apparently it's only open select days but they don't advertise what days. 

On my second day here I went to the front desk to ask if I could complain about these items. I was told they don't have a systems or registering complaints until you check out then they will email a guest survey. I pointed out that it defeats the purpose to take my complaint after I am gone but they said that was their system. 

I'm sure it's a nice hotel when it's in season I just which they would advertise when that season is. The most disappointing was the customer support, they only want feed back after you leave. Guess what by then it's too late, I guess I'll stay somewhere else next time",4,0,1

Pricing: three stars

   Last week, Mandalay Bay beat all the Strip hotels on price. This was the week of major conventions. The price difference was remarkable. Even with the resort fee the price was acceptable.

Room: four stars

   Luxurious describes the rooms at Mandalay Bay. There are two closets.  Two flat screen tvs, one in the main room and another in the bathroom. The bathroom is spacious. It includes a shower plus bath tub. The toilet is in a separate room from the general bathroom. The water pressure met my expectations. And, the fragrance of the room exceeded my expectations. The Maid, for the most part did a good job cleaning the room.

Safety: Two stars

    Hopefully there are cameras at the elevator bank. It is necessary since anybody could walk onto the elevator without a security guard manning them.

Location: Three stars

   Mandalay Bay is the southernmost hotel on the Strip. When the Mandalay Bay-Excalibur tram is not operating, which  lately is after 10:30 p.m., a lengthy walk or transportation is necessary. Because the location is on the southernmost part of the strip, traffic is far less chaotic than the Mid Strip. So having a car at Mandalay Bay is less of a headache. In my opinion with Mandalay Bay, Luxor, and Excalibur connected by indoor walkways, they are one megaproperty. In one megaproperty, there are numerous eating and entertainment options for all budgets.

Amenities: three stars in winter\/ four stars in Summer.  

 In the Summer, Mandalay Beach is the ultimate swimming pool. There are waves, a lazy river, and sand. At night there are a couple of live bands, including a decent house band that plays in Orchid Lounge.
 Personally, I have not been a fan of their restaurants. I have had three bad experiences at the Bayside Buffet. In my opinion, Raffles Cafe is grossly overpriced.The food court is nearly deserted. In my opinion, the connected Luxor and Excalibur offer restaurants with better value-or the closest thing to it on the Strip.
  Mandalay Bay offers three coffee establishments. Two Starbucks and Orchid Lounge.

Check in: The line was nightmarish, however they had enough Front desk people to make a line that would last an hour only take 20 minutes which shows they're very prepared for crowds.

The blackout curtains actually blacked out the room well enough that you never new it was daylight outside if you closed them....wow...The bathroom was large and had a nice large soaking tub and the rest of the room was nice sized as well.

The Buffet: The buffet has an above average selection and is above average in quality. very good food.

The Pool: There is a wave pool along with regular pools and hot tubs. There is real sand in the pool area so thats why its called Mandalay Beach.....The pool area is very busy and obviously very popular. It was alot of fun.

Their suites are spacious and nice! Their bathroom has some weird window though that can't be covered--not great if you're sharing with a bunch of friends and don't want them to see you naked.

Oh, one big downer though. The walls are seemingly thin. I can hear people walking and talking down the hall (doesn't help that our room was pretty close to the elevator) and we definitely could hear muffled conversation from the adjoining room. Also?

Being a local, a wait time of 35 minutes is never OK. They were kind enough to credit me with $75 in dining credits for the delay. We did use it, so it was worth something. Yet, the wait time still is not OK and this should have been dealt with better.  The room was spacious, clean, and the bed was very comfortable. That was all a big plus. The bathrooms are beautiful. The only downside to the room was that we had a very poor view of anything, in fact it was rather pathetic, but otherwise it was a good room. The other issue was that we called room service in the morning to try to order breakfast and we were on the phone 'forever' before they answered, and by then we just decided to go ahead and go get breakfast on our own.

After showing him our email confirmation, James went back and forth from his computer to someone in the back and finally got it ""fixed"" after another 30 minutes.

At first glance our suite seemed nice. But unfortunately there were some problems with it. Being on the 60th floor (40 technically) and it being windy outside, we had to deal with a whine from a crack in the window seal which was  apparently ""fixed"" by DUCT TAPE.  Seriously?? who the hell fixes a cracked\/leaky window seal in a $500 a night hotel room with duct tape????  It was very annoying to hear the wind howling all night. Then there was the bathroom faucet handle, it came off when you turned the water on and off. And finally there was mold on the inside shower door where the maids forgot to clean. Every time.

Who knew that hotels do ""Cyber Monday"" sales too? It was a great deal. We were about 26 floors up if I recall.. beautiful view! The furnishings were modern, the decor upscale, the bed comfortable, I loved the double closets (with automatic lights), I loved the bathroom ""suite"".

-Our toilet didn't properly flush, instead it just kind of disintegrated the toilet paper. And the pipes (from sink) creaked (apparently from others using them).
-""nickel and diming"". Again, my assumption is all Strip hotels do this though? At check in, we were warned that if we even opened the fridge, we would likely be charged. This was upsetting as we had drinks with us (from our road trip) that we couldn't even keep cool! In addition, the snack bar was weighted and we would likely be charged if we moved anything. No standard complimentary coffee either. You had to pay $4 each if you wanted in-room coffee. That is disappointing and I would rather spend $ for a ""fresh"" cup at the Starbux all the way down in the casino. Unfortunately the line was about 25 people thick. So we just opted to wait til we got to brunch (which wasn't an easy wait, lemme tell ya!) ;-)
-Upon check in, we were told we could *ask* for a late check out of 12p instead of 11a.. However, upon calling and asking for it the next day, we were told it wasn't available. understandable but disappointing. Instead we had to check out & leave our bags with valet for approximately an hour while we ate, which cost us a tip both dropping off and picking up. 
-Chaotic arrival. There was a traffic jam outside the hotel, this place is hoppin. Valet of course costs, otherwise you could park far away but still have to pay for parking, then you have to do a long walk through the casino to get back to the lobby. I saw people trying to maneuver through the crowds w\/ their luggage. I was so glad we didn't do that. It was worth the few extra bucks.

If I do find myself in Vegas again, and staying on the Strip, I would definitely consider staying here again. I'd just stay longer than one night.",0,0,0

Despite the abundance of good restaurants in Vegas, I've discovered that it's important to stay at a place with good room service because there's always a day or two where you will be stuck in the room. Typically room service is overpriced, but sometimes it's worth the convenience. Not here though...the food is terrible and flavorless. We even gave it two tries! McDonald's burgers are tastier than the Mandalay's $18 wagyu beef burger. Fail.

Our room was comp'd and reserved at the last minute, so we probably would've never stayed here due to the location. It's at the end of the strip, away from all the action- clubs, poker, shows, etc. The only positive is that it's close to the airport and I didn't miss my flight home at 8am! 

We had some sort of mini suite, which was very spacious and clean. The bathroom was large too, with lots of counter space and even drawers to store your stuff in. Their jacuzzi tub is the largest I have seen in Vegas- even bigger than the one in the 1200 sq ft Palazzo suite I stayed in the week before.

1 star for:
THE ELEVATORS - we had to wait in lines sometimes for 20 minutes or more before we could get on an elevator - especially during checkout on Sunday (we walked down 21 flights instead).

Location - all the way at the south end of the strip. A little far from everything except the airport...
Restaurants, shops, hotel entertainment - very expensive. Example? $17 sunscreen and $6 bottles of water. WTH?

3 stars for:
The rooms - comfy and clean, but you can hear everything in the halls.
The wave pool - way too crowded and the pool was just kind of gross.
Lazy river - fun, but doesn't come with flotation devices so we just walked through it - tons of children there!

4 stars for:
Landshark Lagoon - peaceful fun (21+ only), great waitress service, cornhole\/bags, hot tub and a nice shallow pool to wade through.

I longed for the Wynn Encore. Located on the north side of the strip it's an easy $15 cab ride from the airport.

After waiting for an hour to get to the desk we were told our room wasn't ready yet but it would be in an hour or so. No worries we were starving and found a great brunch place at the nearby Four Seasons hotel. The hotel was going to txt me when the room was ready. Brunch was over and still no text, ok I'll go see what's going on, only to find the line had manifested into a waiting line for the new Frozen ride at DISNEY World. I picked the gold members line and after another 20 min wait finally got to speak to someone about the issue. My room still wasn't ready so I upgraded to the Delano Suites for $30 extra. Worst Vegas hotel experience ever. The Delano is great but I will never be back to this location for anything.

The room was decent, nice big bathroom with tub and shower, though I'm not quite sure why there was a window between the bathroom and entrance foyer...unless we got one of the Kinky Rooms or something, though I don't really get off on watching my fiancee on the toilet, so this whole window thing is still over my head. 

We had a great view overlooking the entire pool area...and that is one big pool area...I think I counted six pools and a river....and a wonderful view of the mountains in the distance. everything looked beautiful lit up at night...one of the reasons I love coming to Vegas...a beautiful city of millions of lights plopped in the middle of the barren darkness of the Nevada desert. 

The hotel is laid out very nicely, everything is clean and classy...wonderful choice of restaurants, good buffet, lots of bars and shopping, with an easy walk to the Luxor next door..and that's about the only easy walk, because if you wanna go to any other casino on the strip, you have a hike ahead of you, or an expensive cab ride...because those buses they have on the Strip...SUCK.

The staff was polite and everything, but the rooms weren't that impressive. I continue to think that these type of hotels are wasted on me, as I expect the price to mean nicer surroundings, and not just have the price be a reflection of the location.

The room was fine, but a little shabby, a la the Westin in Seattle. Scarred furniture, pieces missing, worn out chairs\/seat cushions, that sort of thing. The bed was comfy, although in an attempt to drive me crazy, they don't have fitted sheets - and the flat sheet the did use in it's place wasn't long enough to cover the bed or was applied incorrectly, as where my feet ended up, there was no sheet covering a rather scratchy mattress pad.

The wireless internet was so slow that you couldn't even get your computer to load their ""accept the terms and conditions"" page. Thinking it was the fault of the wireless, I tried wired - nope. Same problem. When my tethered cell phone is orders of magnitude faster, that's really unfortunate.

I was excited for the TV in the bathroom - SportsCenter while I shave. But no - it was broken. No signal\/didn't turn on\/something like that. I didn't take it down off the wall to check cable connections, as they were inaccessible, and I left my toolbelt at home. Also, please note the most expensive addition yet to the list of Hotels Without Proper Bathroom Ventiliation. The toilet was in a very small, claustrophobic room with no fan at all. Kind of interesting.

The final straw for me was the carpet - this horrible berber stuff that I assume was made of stainless steel wire. I know this sounds really hoity toity and nit picky, but it actually hurt my feet. The carpet had patches of a much more confortable, plush, leopard print design...and for an entire week, once I got back to the room and took my shoes off to relax...I found myself hopping around, playing the ""floor is made of lava"" game as a 27 year old.

I'm not a Vegas guy - it's cool, but I don't gamble or drink, so most of the appeal is lost on me. And thus, I don't think I'd be back of my own volition anytime soon. That said, if I am ever back, I hope it's not here.",2,2,0

It is just that..cardio equipment only.  If you want more than that (i.e. weights) you have to pay $25\/day.  Not cool.

Ok so on to the pool.  What a nightmare.  If we were not down to the pool by 10am there were no available chairs.

--Beds are OK. 
--Very nice TVs. 
--The housekeeping service is quick, they came at 9am (we were Sooo not ready, lol) but they came back when we went to the pool at noon.
--Great Bell Hop service. The bell hops that meet you are super quick and friendly, unfortunately that is where the great service ends.

--The POOL is a ZOO. Kids are everywhere and if you don't get to the pool at 9am forget about getting a chair.

--SERVICE is a ZERO. Everyone is really rude. I guess they don't have to be helpful with so many people staying there, but I will NEVER stay there again. People won't even look at you, not even a smile or a ""hello"" when you try to ask a question (and I am very nice and charming!). Terrible.
--ELEVATORS are SLOW. I know this might seem a petty thing, but you LITERALLY have to compete with other hotel patrons to get on a stupid elevator. I don't know why they are so slow, but every single elevator ride I took was FULL to the brim with people, very uncomfortable.

We were supposed to get a sky suite with two beds, a couch with a pull out and a kitchenette.  I was really stoked about the room. Well, it didn't work out that way at all. We ended up getting a room with one king bed, a couch and a sitting room. They said we could wait a few more hours to get a better room, but it was already five pm! Why isn't the room already ready?!? Well, the customer services at check-in were horrible and totally not helpful and it may be because they had a ridiculous line and was totally understaffed, but that is not my fault.  Did you not know all these people were going to check-in today? Was it a surprise? Either way, we went from having a sky suite to a suite next to the ice and vending machines, so it was loud and rather annoying due to the incoming and outgoing people traffic. Thank you Mandalay Bay!

The cleaning staff and everyone else were extremely nice! If we called for something, they brought it right up. I would have to say that our stay was nice, but not as great as my stay at the Delano the days before we checked in here. Why did we switch?!? I wish we didn't, especially after dealing with the staffing issues at check-in. 

It is a beautiful hotel and everything is updated, which is a total plus. The pool is really nice. They have tube rentals for the lazy river, but they go fast. You can buy one if you want, they do have them, ranging from $20-24. The pool entrance does require a hotel card and you can bring up to four people per card. You do need your identification to use you card to make purchases. 

Would I come back here? Maybe during off season, so I wouldn't have to wait forever in the check-in line and maybe get the room we booked. But I think I would rather stay somewhere else next time...",1,0,1

We also had  a chance to enjoy the beach area - super clean and not crowded - with a live DJ and an attentive staff keeping our drinks flowing.  Of course the best part about staying at the south-end of the strip was catching the Michael Jackson Cirque show which was showcased at this resort.

Mandalay Bay is one of the better-looking casinos on the strip. However, it's very different than many of the other casinos in that it's not even close to the gimmicky-ness that is proudly boasted by casinos such as Paris, The Venetian, Treasure Island, etc. Nice casino to gamble\/eat\/watch shows in, pretty relaxed atmosphere and not as crowded as some of the others since it's at one end of The Strip.  I like that it doesn't smell like cigarette smoke on the floors either. Friendly staff.

If you want to visit the Shark Reef, plan in advance and don't wait for your last day in Vegas to do it, because lines can get incredibly long during prime tourist season and tickets have been sold out before.",2,0,1

Check-in: the lines weren't that long and overall the process was fast. We did have checked bags (we arrived at 9 in the morning and checked into our room that afternoon) that took a while to get up to our room.

Room: good size, nice and clean, overall appealing look. Contemporary but comfortable. I would say the rooms are a step above Luxor, NYNY, MGM, basically nicer than the other hotels in close proximity. The water pressure in the shower was good. Nothing worse than recovering from a hangover and not being able to take a decent shower.

Amenities: Mandalay has an awesome pool (I have a separate review for it), they have a HUGE casino floor (I'm not a big gambler, so I can't go into many of the details), and plenty of restaurants, cafes, bars, etc. Two of my favorite restaurants on The Strip are here, so I'm a happy camper :)

So why only 3 stars? I was disappointed with the concierge. We went to concierge to buy some show tickets. We didn't really know what we wanted to see and it was sort of last minute and the process was excruciatingly slow. To make matters worse, we were told to go to the wrong casino and when we checked in at the box office to pick up our tickets we were told we needed to go somewhere entirely different. The hassle of rushing to Rio from Caesar's was a pain and we missed the beginning of the show. When I contacted someone about this they didn't even offer an apology.",3,3,0

Casino: Ok

Room Elavators: SLOW. It took us every day about 10-30 mins just to get to our room from the casino level. The worst.   

Eye Candy Bar: TERRIBLE Service. Bartenders ARROGANT and drinks expensives. $8.00 for a botttle of Coors Light. Ouch!!

Red Square, China Grill: Good happy hour drinks and food.

Lupo Restaurant: Great food and service. Nice portions. 

Irish Pub: Terrible service and food was greasy and bad. Bad choice.

Valet Parking: The worst. Waited in a long line several days returning from meetings at least 20-30 mins waiting for vallet service to park. Pick up was great. 

Fitness Center: Cardio room free. Not great. The real gym is at The Hotel and $15.00 per day to work out. Rip off. 

Foundation Room (Top of Hotel Bar): Boring and not worth a look. They do have a 2 for 1 card from 6-10pm. Nice place but just a weird vibe and boring. Go to another place for bar scene. A bunch of ""Meathead\/Monster drinking\/Tattoo guys"" in place.",1,1,1

It seemed they have a few more upscale restaurants than other casinos, but I cant think about eating, when I can gamble. Okay, here is my gambling tip from reading many books about blackjack, trust me I am an expert. I can play blackjack better than anyone. At first, the other bettors do not like this strategy, I am about to tell you, but there is no other way to play blackjack than with surrender. I tell people twice whether they want my advice or not because I think some people want to learn and others can lose their money if they want to. Surrender means when you get your first 2 cars and you do not like them you yell out surrender. You get half your bet back, and those who do not understand gambling think it is a chicken strategy. However, I can convince you if you have common sense like me. If the dealer has a 10, and you have 14,. 15 and 16 you will lose 80% of the time. Yet, everyone acts as if they have to beat the dealer to 21. If you hit on these hands, you will most likely bust. Now, here is the aggressive strategy when you have 8, 9, 10, 11, and the dealer has 14, 15, and 16 you have to double down. Yes, even with an 8!!!! You could double for less though which is a hedge bet. As for card counting techniques, I do not believe it helps with the new shufflers. I did read busting vegas with the mit grads, and it was way to complicated. California casinos do not have surrender which makes it less likely for me to play. Only nj and las vegas have surrender.  I only won $100 after 8 hours of playing, but the difference is I stayed on the table and people lost thousands of dollars because of ignorance. I should learn craps which is way more social and has better odds than blackjack.
Ok, it's getting me mad the hand, I split 4 7's and double downed killed me. I was playing for 7 hours and was $235 up. I split against a 6. i figured I would push the hands. but in no way did i figure to lose all 6 hands after the split. Also, I dont think a casino should have the rule you have to play double the max if you play 2 hands. I hate that rule!!
 I wish I could say I went to the pool area, that I had heard about on wild on e, but looking down from my hotel room it was to cool for sunbathing. Okay, I forgot to add the radio commercials for mandalay bay are misleading. When they say tahiti village or the other creative names for a row of rooms. The commercial  it makes it sound as if it is a resort with a seperate lodging area not attrached to the casino. I know what I mean. Getting back to the women, there are so many hot women in vegas who know how to dress the right way, it's overwhelming. All the guys I met joked about their neck hurting. One thing when you do a double stare at a girl and she stares back it's shady if she is by herself. Twice, I though women were checking me out. So sad!",0,1,0

The best hotels were Trump International a (5 Plus Stars) , Aria (5 Plus Stars), The M (5 Plus Stars), and Vdara a (5 Star as well). We don't go to gamble, so we like the smoke free resort feel, of the newer hotels. Last week we stayed at The Hotel and we were less than impressed. As a matter of fact the last time we stayed at Mandalay Bay we were not happy either. There was a convention in town and the wait at the elevators to get back to our room was 20 minutes each time, never book there during a convention. I had originally booked Mandalay Bay this trip as well because of the price, but we received a upgrade for $25.00 per night for a mini suite at The Hotel, so we went with the upgrade. The Hotel staff and Mandalay Bay staff are not very friendly or knowledgeable. The mini suite was extremely small, the hotel is dark, and sounds like you are in a wind tunnel. They authorize the full amount on your credit card regardless of how much you spend in incidentals, in our case for two nights we were charged $200.00 and spent only $6.99 in incidentals. Now we are waiting for a refund of $193.01 that should show up in a ""few days"". If they charge each guest $100.00 a night extra and then take a week to refund your money, Im curious as to how much interest they earn each year by doing this. I just got off the phone with a front desk manager at Mandalay Bay asking for a explanation and she said its a Nevada Law. I explained to her that no other hotels did this and she flippantly said she wasn't  going to call all the other hotels and ask their policy. But I stated that she just told me this was a Nevada Law. Then she said she way trying to help me, and if I didn't want to be helped she was going to terminate my call. Skip Mandalay Bay and The Hotel. Oh and the elevators in The Hotel fit (5 people) so even if all else was acceptable, being crammed into those tiny elevators was a joke.

Both times I've been very happy with my stay.  I have to say that it's one of my favorite hotels in terms of design; I just love the tropical feel and airiness of the place, compared to, say, the Paris hotel where I feel a little claustrophobic due to the dimness and the low ceiling.  The newly refurbished rooms are absolutely beautiful; they now have plasma tv's in the room and in the bathroom, too!  

We took the kids here, and they went gaga over the wave pool; the perfect antidote to 100-degree weather.  However, other reviewers have mentioned that if you go at the wrong time of the day, you won't find any seats.  That is absolutely correct.  The first day we went, we were there at about 1 pm, and there were no seats whatsoever around the beach.  We finally found some seats at the bar area and by the lazy river area, but only regular chairs, not lounge chairs.  The best time to go would be before or at 10 am; any time after that and you're on your own.  

My other gripe was that we wanted to get something to eat around 1 am on our last night there, and the only place that was open was Raffles Cafe, which is their 24-hour restaurant.  Incredibly, there was a line of maybe 6-8 groups ahead of us waiting to get seated, and it was taking quite a while.  I really wasn't expecting to wait in line for 30 minutes at 1 am just to get something to eat.  Some groups even decided that they would have better luck elsewhere and left.  There were a lot of empty tables, so I'm thinking that it was a staffing problem that caused the wait.

I waited for five minutes and still no attendant.... I had to walk back out to the lobby and the only lady willing to even acknowledge me was visibly annoyed by me coming to ""bother"" her to get some assistance just to get a locker key and robe.

We specifically picked Mandalay Bay because we had such a great time when we stayed  there 3 years ago. We couldn't wait to go back for this occasion!

When we arrived to check in, we learned for the first time that Mandalay Bay- without telling us- had decided to cancel our reservation (made quite a few months earlier through Priceline) and gave our room to an IBM Convention. 

No effort was made to contact us ahead of time about this. We were given the weak excuse that they didn't have our contact information because we booked WHOLESALE. This was emphasized because I guess that makes it ok? We booked our flight through Priceline as well, and Alaska Airlines was able to contact us ahead of time to tell us that our flight info had changed. So somehow Alaska got our contact info through Priceline but Mandalay Bay did not. ok...

The lady at the desk had a long whispered conversation with her supervisor and came back to say that we were being moved to an upgraded room at The Signature, and gave us a $150 food and beverage credit which was nice.

What was NOT nice was they didn't even offer to take us to The Signature. We weary travelers were left to fend for ourselves. The supervisor never so much as glanced at us while we were asking the poor front desk clerk why and how this happened. Isn't the supervisor's job to quell situations like this? 

The Signature has been lovely, but again- we chose Mandalay Bay specifically for my birthday trip. Not The Signature, which is about a 10 minute walk from the casino. Also now we are tipping $5 a pop for valet parking because we decided to rent a car after all of this nonsense. 

Anyways, anyone looking to make reservations at Mandalay Bay beware because they apparently make it a practice to cancel your reservation and toss you into a tower far away from any casino without telling you. Especially us losers who book through a third party. Just a ridiculous experience.

They did make a minimal effort to right things, but again nobody bothered to contact us ahead of time so maybe we could have planned for the change. Maybe they think it is more fun to surprise their guests with this kind of news! And their supervisors couldn't care less if you like it or not. Who doesn't love having their reservation cancelled without notice by a hotel you were specifically staying at for your birthday?

The housekeeping staff was exceptional and friendly the times we ran into them. Annabelle specifically took great care of us and was very patient when we happened to return to the room while she was trying to straighten it up. The staff giving out towels at the pool was friendly and outgoing. The room itself was on the 30th floor and we enjoyed the view. The pool was clean and enjoyable. That said, we hit a few snags. The first thing that rubbed me the wrong way, I was waiting in line for the concierge. Had been waiting for about 5 minutes as they were busy. I was up next and the woman made direct eye contact with me. I started to move forward as it was my turn and a man walked up and cut right in front of me. Instead of telling him that I was next, she helped him first. Pretty bad customer service in my opinion. The second issue was the bathroom. It had a bad smell when we first checked in. I spent my first two days outside of Vegas so I didn't really care. When I came back, it had gotten completely unbearable. I called to report it and all I said was that I had noticed an unpleasant odor in the bathroom. The woman repeated back to me, ""you smell sewage in the bathroom, we'll be right up."" I never said that but it led me to believe that this is a recurring problem that they just stick a bandaid on whenever there's a complaint. That said, someone arrived quickly to repair it, left to get some tools, came back and fixed it. He promised it'd be better within 24 hours and it was. But man, there is no way the person cleaning that room didn't notice the smell prior to our checkin. It really should have been addressed before they put guests in that room.",0,0,0

I've heard great things from friends about this hotel and I booked deluxe room. A few days after I booked the room, I got an email from Mandalay offering to upgrade my room for an extra $15. I quickly agreed as the Great Room suite seemed much better for the price.

However, upon arrival I was told that I could not have a smoking room. They told me it was something that they try to accommodate, but is not required. I told them I would have never of agreed to an upgrade had I known they wouldn't be able to give me a smoking room. They brought over an manager to explain further that if I wanted a smoking room, I would have to pay for an upgrade again. The manager, Kristin, who we spoke with regarding our room didn't care one bit about our situation and lacked empathy. 

Instead of this, I opted to downgrade to the room I originally asked for. Upon arriving in the room, the bathroom was dirty and full of pubic hairs.  I called down to guest services and asked for an extra ice bucket. For an extra ice bucket, it's $5 each. No other rooms were available and we were stuck with a pubic filled bathroom.

Valet was pretty bad too with long wait times and I had to load my own luggage in my car since there not enough bell hops on staff.

The customer service at this hotel is absolutely horrendous. I will never, ever stay at this hotel again. The staff at this hotel did their best to try to ruin my weekend in Las Vegas and I would not recommend this place to anyone.

Planning to stay for the July 4th fireworks - rumor had it & tons of travel articles published the fact Mandalay Bay was the best place to be for viewing the fireworks, so we booked our Strip-view room post haste

Realizing we could arrive a day earlier, we were unable to extend our reservation & had to select another room.....no big deal except that we had to go through the checkout \/ check in process all over again.  

Hoping to just transfer bags into our new room, we were refused a ""late checkout"", even though we weren't really checking out.....we were there 2 more days.  Instead, we had to leave the 1st room, take luggage to the huge line at the concierge desk to be ""held"" until our new room was ready & then going through the whole check-in \/ acquiring baggage all over again was a huge pain....'cause they didn't offer to lend a hand to create a seamless process. It was OUR responsibility

And being located at the very end of the Strip, you'll need to plan on commuting a least 1 hour to get to the center-Strip via the monorail system or hand over your wallet for a taxi

Their ""celebrity"" restaurants are mostly meaty & we did not find any vegetarian dinner-worthy options so we were relegated to the chain restaurants located in the Mandalay Shoppes - which didn't really provide us w\/ any kind of unique Vegas dining experience

For the rooms themselves..... the A\/C barely worked.  Both rooms were extremely hot & this was w\/ the thermostat set to 65.  The door to the bathroom in our Strip-view room wouldn't stay closed, so we had to prop something against it, just to get some privacy

The beds were too soft & extremely small to boot.  We were only provided 1 hotel-sized tube of shampoo \/ conditioner for 3 of us & they knew full well we had 3 people occupying the room

Worst part?  The Mandarin & Cosmopolitan hotels totally blocked 99% of the fireworks so we saw next to nothing.

Extremely disappointing stay & one we will not experience again",12,8,11

The room we stayed was nice not sure if it warranted and extra $20 bucks per night that other hotels don't charge as they prefer to accomodate their guest requests with out gouging for more money. Couple of things about the room - lot's of noises from the fire alarm beeping, clicking noise not sure what that was about and the paper thin walls are crazy as we heard the neighbors going at it for few hours - LOL.

Its at the start of the strip and (this actually appeals to me) the hotel itself seemed quieter.  On Friday and again on Monday, the crowd was only slightly different but it could have also been due to the time I visited which was the weekend before thanksgiving.  I also recommend signing up on mlife.com, I did get some discounts on the room and I presume I'll get points of some type.

Friday Visit - It was fairly quiet.  Not a whole lot going on anywhere.  I went to one of the restaurant's between this hotel and Luxor (review for RiRa separate) and otherwise I walked around, there wasn't a whole lot of life, gambled a little and went back to my room.  If there was more going on I think I would have been more inclined to gamble more.  I liked the room choice but it was not what I selected online.  I choose a king bed and when I checked in I was told they only had two queen's unless I wanted to pay to upgrade.  I understand there might be some fine print saying ""as available"" but in the digital age its silly to me that they overbook their types of rooms and then charge me to change it.  Having said that though, the $50 upgrade in my opinion was nice, I got a view of the strip and the airport and the design of the room had a nice table seating area.  Of my two visits I liked this room more and I paid more for my second room.

Monday visit - I expected this to be more mild and it was.  I had an enjoyable time but after grabbing some food, did a little gambling and then headed back. I paid for a better room this night but ended up stuck on the back side of the hotel at the very end of a very long hall.  The room was nice overall but it lacked outlets at the desk (standard two but one had the lamp, the nearest was some distance away, for a desk for work it should have been closer).  Overall I was happy with it just the one with the table, airport and strip view was better.


Overall, the place is nice and clean.  I like that its more resort and less wild casino but would like for more people to visit.  All the action is definitely in the center of the strip and having a quieter experience is cool but at the same time, little action on the floor didn't really incentivize gambling.",2,1,1

When I booked, I received a $50 hotel credit & we used it on breakfast.  $26 steak & eggs and the $20 American breakfast (eggs & sausage) with a $9 bloody mary.  The delivery \/ cover charge was $9.  There is more than enough hash browns & eggs for 1 person.  As a after thought, I should've ordered the waffle which came a la carte & just snagged some hash browns from the Hubs.

And while I'm against imperialism, the Mandalay Bay successfully captures of of the romanticism of British imperialism of Burma, with its luxurious hotel, perhaps arguably the most luxurious hotel on the strip.  (Although the sister property - THEhotel - adjacent to the Mandalay Bay is much nicer.)   

With a fabulous spa and pool, plenty of fine dining places, a mall connecting Mandalay Bay to THEhotel, and plenty of gambling space (not to mention the Mandalay Events Center which hosts boxing matches, concerts, and shows), the Mandalay Bay and THEhotel are self-contained luxury havens in Las Vegas.

Our room, on the 31st floor, was very spacious.  The king size bed was very comfortable as were the divan and chair\/ottoman in the room.  (I fell asleep on the former the first night.)  The bathroom was huge with separate shower and (very deep) bath tub.  The toilet had its own little room.  Track lights under the bathroom vanity helped you make your way to that toilet at night.  There were also some track lights that ran behind the headboard, creating a cool ""low light"" environment.

The staff at the hotel were all very friendly and helpful.  The casino, which we did not use but had to pass through, was less smokey than most.  Some have complained of this hotel's being too far from the heart of the Strip, but I kinda liked that.  After spending hours traversing the nuttiness of the Strip, it was nice to come home to a place that was a bit quieter.

My helpful hint:  Unless there is some kind of problem with your bill and you really need to check out in person, use the express check out on the room TV.  I did and I was done checking out in about twenty seconds.  When we made our way to the lobby and saw the huge lines at the check out desk, we knew we'd done good.",0,0,0

We just stayed there for the long Memorial Day weekend, and as usual, the boys LOVED the wave pool. They spent hours upon hours in it. For that alone, the hotel is worth it - hours of peace for two haggard parents! 

Negatives on the pool for those looking to relax.... On a busy holiday weekend, there's very limited seating. You have a few options to remedy that. You can purchase a cabana - prices fluctuate with demand. Morning price was $800! (Yikes!) By 1 PM, it was down to $500. (Still yikes!) You can also sit in a relatively comfortable bar area for the expense of some over priced drinks. No sunbathing there though. OR, and this is my first time experiencing this, you can tip a cabana boy to grab you a few lounge chairs and place them in an open area. Perfect! 

The hotel itself has gone downhill though. Our room wasn't as clean as I'd like. And, I had to call multiple times to get more towels... with 4 people in the room, they kept giving us only 3 towels. I also had to call to replenish soap and shampoo. Stuff that normally gets replaced daily. Oh! And the towel holder fell right off the wall when I touched it!",0,0,0

The lady informed me that the TV and artwork was damaged, and that they would send me pictures of such damage. I received the pictures and clearly the TV is a bad TV (it has lines thru it on the slide, a common thing to go bad on flat-screens) , the artwork showed a smudge at the bottom. I happened to have taken pictures of the room when we checked-in, and the same marks are clearly visible on the artwork.  It's a hotel , not museum quality artwork. Clearly the ""so-called"" damage to the artwork was from a prior guest, but Delano guest services will not listen to anything you say.

Even though the hotel itself is considered to be quite out of the way from the rest of the casinos on the strip, it offers more in their typical room than most other higher-scale casinos.  The additional square footage is definitely noticeable, along with having a 42"" HD plasma tv on the wall facing the beds, another smaller HD tv in the bathroom, ipod capable clock radio, his and her closets (!), his and her sinks, shower AND tub, a separated toilet, reading lights built into the beds, workspace, and a view of the pool area (Mandalay's backyard) to boot!

The hotel's casino is huge and it is quite a pleasant surprise to find the casino not completely filled with cigarette smoke as I've previously encountered at other hotels.  Instead, they've somehow replaced it with a subtle scent of fresh coconuts.  Their sportsbook is SPECTACULAR...one of the most impressive I've seen.  The casino level is also directly connected to THEhotel on one side and a mall that leads to Luxor and Excalibur, along with a ton of great restaurants, as well.  You basically never have to leave this resort -- it has everything you'd possibly need.

One thing I was disappointed with was the pillow-top beds...they were far too soft for a side-sleeper like myself.  (If you like firm, the beds at MGM Grand are the best!)  The quality of the bed sheets was low in comparison to those at MGM Grand, even when this hotel is supposed to be on a slightly higher scale.  For this reason, I can't give Mandalay 5 stars...yes, I put a lot of weight on beds, ha.

For those who aren't VIP (i.e. me)...imagine all this at the unbelievable rate of stay one night, get the next comped (!) as one of their promotions (came out to $50\/night).  I bet there's no place on the strip that can possibly beat that two-fer!

I actually qualified for their floating holiday promotion too...so Thursday night was free, Friday night was $230, and Saturday night was $300.  So about $177\/night on average...works for me...and it was cheaper than MGM was that weekend (cus they were hosting the UFC fight)...so why pay more for a crappier hotel?

    Checking in was a breeze and I tipped the front desk person $20. She was very nice and she upgraded my room to a strip view. It wasn't as good as my view at the Bellagio, but it was a view nonetheless...so I was happy. 

   The rooms and hallways are very clean and nicely outfitted. Although I do wish they had power curtains like some of the other casinos do. But they made up for it by having a very useful iHome alarm clock\/radio\/iPod dock, a bad ass 42"" LCD TV in the room, and another LCD TV in the bathroom. The his & her sinks were also a nice touch, and the complimentary toiletries and hair dryer are of good quality so you don't have to bring the stuff from home. 

  Okay now some bad stuff: First off I was put on the 33rd floor, which meant just about anytime I was taking the elevator to\/from my room I had to deal with like 4-6 stops at a time...it got frustrating by day two.  I will also note that upon checking in my room there were finger prints on the window, cigarette butts in the ashtray, and the shower seal leaked. One call and I got it all fixed very quickly, but still worth mentioning (and docked them a star).

 Overall for the price I paid I'm very happy with my stay at Mandalay Bay. It may also help that I made like $250 playing black jack during my first two nights there. So in way I got two of three nights free.  I also did some dry cleaning which I had picked up at 11 pm on Thursday and it was back in my room dry cleaned and pressed by 3 pm on Friday.  I also called in for some complimentary bath robes and slippers...surprisingly they even had separate his and hers slippers, a nice touch.  Again that works for me. 

  I will note that Mandalay is quite a ways being at the way southern tip of the strip. However there tram between Mandalay, Luxor and Excalibur definitely makes things easier...as once you get to Excalibur you can't walk across to MGM and take the monorail from there if you need to get anywhere more north.  Of course there is the Taxi, but that's a very expensive option when the strip traffic picks up at night.  I would definitely consider staying at Mandalay Bay again.

So the bad - first off the free wifi only works on the first two floors...and of course most rooms are higher up than that - so why are we paying a resort fee for something that doesn't work in the rooms, a bit annoying. Secondly the TV automatically is cranked way loud when you turn it on ....doesn't matter if you turn it down...turn it off and come back - the TV automatically is up to a standard that seems. Something else I noticed on my last visit were some bathroom tiles that were literally falling off wall around the floor - cosmetic but it seems like you would do a better job of keeping the basic room since since you are quicker to sell them than the high end rooms 

So the good - a number of things which is why I like it here - for one I usually win at the hotel when I do gamble which is a plus - i mean this is Vegas. The top food draw here is The Pub in the back of the casino, its big has over 300 beers on tap and is great for groups, football sundays or having a beer when you first get in  - see my review here - http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/the-pub-at-monte-carlo-las-vegas?hrid=rDMItdNC2AIOYUNhKHzBCQ

The pub is in the mall area that leads towards the Aria hotel which s one of the newer higher end hotels in the area - see my review for that here - http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/aria-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas?hrid=Ei4gkvx1pn_FyQTlEUkaQQ

The other draw here is the pool during the hotter months - I have a review for that a well - check that out here  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/the-pools-at-monte-carlo-las-vegas?hrid=LqiLayTlYhiWlSfGt2Q5-A 

The casino itself is easy to get through its a bit of a longer rectangular shape and easy to navigate which I think is a plus. I also like the food court here as it stays open through the night - which Ive tested at 3 and 4am a few times 

Being a M Life players club member is a plus - it works for more than just earning comps when playing - use it when you check in, use it when you eat at the restaurants around the casino - its works all over and at other top hotels as well so jump on getting one

Their pool is pretty nice and during the evenings they often have concerts and other fun events.

The downsides are obvious - Mandalay is farther down the strip but they do have the tram that helps. They opened theHotel but I feel like the main hotel is going to need a freshening especially as they're bunched in with Excalibur and the Luxor which are decidedly downmarket.

So, I'm going to give the Mandalay Bay 3 stars because it is pretty pricey and at the end of the strip. If I was here for pleasure, for this price I would probably stay more in the center of the strip.

However, my stay here was very nice. The rooms are spacious - i had a 2 queen room which had a nice flat screen, bedside lighting, enough space for a desk and a side chair. There were two closets. One has the rod hung tall enough to hang a wedding dress or a formal. That was interesting, but made sense in Vegas. Not so convenient for a short gal, but I used the other one.

The bathroom is marble with the separate ""pooper"" room (as my husband calls it), a glassed in shower which is separate from the jacuzzi tub (rectangular, not round). It's a relatively spacious for a hotel bathroom. The obligatory phone is by the toilet. That always makes me laugh.

There is no in-room coffee pot, but I don't think there is at any hotel on the strip. This is a huge hotel with many rooms and several conventions going on but the wait for the elevator is minimal to none.

The complex itself is very nice. It was unusually cold when we were there so I did not use the beach area, but it rocks. Our conference had a party there our last night and it would definitely be worth the price of the hotel room to have access to this in the summer.

There are several restaurants in the complex. It is HUGE! In fact, it seemed like we were walking miles back and forth to the convention center. The restaurants were kind of pricey, but I only ate at a few as many of our meals were provided. The drinks were pricey too. $10 for a house wine or mixed drink in the casino. Once again, I am told that's Vegas.

There are several clubs in the complex. One is on top of THE Hotel and it has a great view of the strip. Another one is called ""Light"" and it is evidently THE place to be on Wednesday night. You will see lots of crazy outfits, Cirque de Soleil folks, etc.

I'm not a gambler (I know, you just stopped reading) so I can't say much about the casino part. People seemed to be having fun, but what is the point in video roulette or craps? Seems to take away all the excitement.

I only went outside the casino once during 4 days. That was to jog. You even have shopping in between the Luxor and the Mandalay. Vegas is crazy.",2,2,2

They are pushing prices up to make the guest bleed every penny they can get out of them.  The in room coffee is a charge of 4.00 so you have to buy everything.

Non-smoking room smells very smokey. People still smoke in the corridors.

The bathroom has a large window on the entry hall, so you can't let room service in the room, if someone in the bathroom wants privacy.

The closets are cut in half vertically with a shelf above and hanging space below.  Great unless you want to hang a pair of men's pants - not enough room.

NO IN-ROOM COFFEE,  room service (+-$20) or lobby restaurants.  A mini-fridge is $35\/night.

Rooms overlooking the pool, even those over 30 floors up, are noisy from the band playing until 11:00.  Neighboring rooms were having a party on their return from the casino - love to be awakened at 2:00 - noise too 3:30.  Especially appreciated if you have a 6:00 AM wake-up for a conference.

Alarm clock didn't work.  A service person came up and said - hey the time is correct!  But didn't think the alarm clock function on the alarm clock not working was a problem.

They charge $5 for one disposable coffee cup and supplies, my boyfriend wanted a wine bottle opener and they charge a $5 delivery fee (wtf!)---and last, but certainly not least, I came down with a fever, so I called guest services to see if they had a thermometer or something or someone that could help me.

I checked in at 4pm, which is pretty late and leaves ample time for the hotel to clean the rooms.

I get into my room and things are off:

- door jams so you have to really push to open it
- half used lotion and shampoo bottles
- exposed, faulty looking wires
- dirty, used sink

Clearly didn't take the time to clean the room thoroughly. The room just looked like it needed a major overhaul. Also, when the front desk gave me a room, she stated that it was on a higher floor, which I appreciated-until I realized it was the lowest floor in my building.

We asked the guy at the desk if someone was refilling the water, he said it was in progress. He just brushed us off like we were annoying him for free water and we weren't paying guest! 10 minutes later still no water, we gave up and went on our way.

We did not want to haul our bags all the way upstairs and down the hallway, it was really annoying that we were told that we couldn't get a late checkout and then be told that we could have a later checkout!  The house of Blues was amazing, food was so good and reasonable for the strip! Large portions for a reasonable price!  

After our brunch we went to the spa, I wanted to use my Mlife card to get points for buying the spa day passes, the guy said you have to go upstairs and go to the desk to add points, at the front desk the lady added the transaction to the card no problem!

This is not a ""I'm gonna party"" hotel but caters more to business travellers such as conference attendees. I have seen some honeymooners. Room is clean and pretty. And spacious enough to work though the table has an odd shape. I love the stand up shower and the tub just outside it. You can soak day's work in peace. And when you need to go, the toilet has its own ""room"" with doors. Bonus. 

Unlike some hotels on the strip, cardio room is free. Zip. No charge. You need to pay more though if you need to use the weight room. 

Internet speed is decent. 

The restaurants inside the hotel are superb - I tried four of them. Buffet is decent but not great. 

What I like most about this hotel is that it is not chaotic. The elevator is far enough from the casino and far enough from the Vegas crowd. You are not greeted by gamblers in the morning and drunk teenagers at night. Or children. 

Children are fun except when they're rowdy. And the noise of slot machines make them rowdy. 

I will recommend this to anyone who will go to Vegas for work. But not to vacationers - too far from the center of the strip. From Caesar Palace - cab ride was $15. 

I am giving it a four for service, cleanliness, room aesthetics,  staff's attentiveness (generally) and somewhat peacefulness (Vegas-style).

I've only stayed in their rooms one time about 10 years ago and my room was one of the smaller rooms.  Nice and clean, but thought it was small.  My most recent visit wasn't too bad, wasn't too crazy, and wasn't full of the ""Vegas Baby"" crowd.  

Reasons I like the Mandalay Bay:
-The Aquarium:  I don't drive out of my way to go here, but every once in awhile friends and family with kids want to check it out. 
-Clean casino, spacious, airy, and doesn't smell like smoke.
-Good poker games here on the weekends.  Small room, but good games from time to time. 
-Parking:  If parking and valet is tough, I will choose to park at the aquarium side. 
-Pool:  One of my favorite pools out here. Pools are large enough, both kid and adult friendly.  
-Buffet:  Not much of a buffet person, but still think Mandalay has a decent buffet. Costly, but still good. 
-Everyone once in awhile I still get comp offers in the mail for rooms, free play, etc.  

Couple of Cons:
-Events\/Concerts:  Expect a busy Mandalay
-Slots and Table Games:  I don't play these much, but the limits are not within my budget.  

Overall, only give the Mandalay 4 stars because I don't go out of my way to come here.  4 Stars because Mandalay is still one of the cleanest and classy casinos\/hotels that you will find out here.  Plus, it's a convenient in and out.  I don't go out of my way to come out here.  But if you see a check in from me, it's almost guaranteed that I am with guest from out of town.",5,2,4

The room we had was decent, and for the most part clean, except for the random female (i presume) hairs against the walls in the shower. Other than that, the room was great with a nice view of the pool area and the airport. 

As for the pool area, for a hotel that advertises it's awesome pool and lazy river, I was a little offended when I discovered I had to pay $22.00 for an inflatable tube to ride around the small, 3 feet deep lazy river. The drinks at the hotel are expensive as with anything on the strip (unless of course you're playing, then the drinks are free). Other than the inflateables, the pools were great. My only other bitch about the pool is the wave pool. Again, for something so highly advertised, why in the hell is there only one wave every five minutes? Maybe I am naive or spoiled by past water parks, but it was not very exciting to sit there waiting for one wave. 

Also, just for what it is worth, I had $40.00 stolen out of my shoe while I was at the beach. 

This is a very nice hotel, and I love the ""theme"" of this casino and hotel. Had a very nice casino, cool construction, and nice decoration.

Also, Mandalay Bay was very friendly with outside liquor and beer. My fiancee and I brought alcohol in to the hotel at the time of check in (a lot of beer and liquor) and nobody said anything. We also brought beer in cans to the pool, and likewise, nobody said anything or stopped us. There is a liquor store across the street from the hotel that sells foam coolers and lots of alcohol at reasonable prices to help survive the high prices charged by the hotel. 

My other problems:

It was a pain in the ass to get somebody on the phone at guest services for them to clean my room. I had to call three times for them to finally come clean my room once and clean towels after being there for two and a half days at the point. We literally had no towels and no toilet paper (we poop a lot; it's the buffets). 

I don't like being ""nickeled and dimed"" for everything at this hotel, but it was a good experience. My only other real complaint is the location of the hotel. It is at the very bottom of the strip, so if you want to feel like you are part of the Strip's ""Vibe"" then I would recommend staying somewhere else. There are bus passes that can be bought to get you down the strip if you are willing to walk, there is also the tram, and cabs. What I noticed from a lot of the cab drivers though, is that they will take you out of the way to make you spend more money with them.

First impressions of the Resort were overall very positive!  Check-in was super quick and the hotel staff was very friendly.

From there, things went downhill.  The room presented reasonably well.  However, once being in the room for more than 20 minutes, things started showing.  The room felt ""old"" and used.  Sitting and laying on the bed (king size suite) was generally uncomfortable, as the bed had obvious indentations from bodies sleeping.  The room lamp (looks cool!) was beaten and battered...the phones didn't work, and we were completely locked out of the fridge!  We noticed stains on the comforter, and some of the towels had brown marks on them! Does Mandalay Bay wash their linens?!  The towels themselves were very rough, and felt more like sandpaper than a luxury towel.  The shower, while generally nice, lacked sufficient hot water to make it through the morning routine.  Two mornings in a row! What gives?!

When these problems were brought to the staffs attention, there was a complete lack of courtesy, as they inquired that ""despite your problems, are you enjoying your stay?""  They did not care about the problem, and made no effort to resolve the issues.

PRICE - For what you get, the price is great! It's not too expensive but in the same block you can always find some nice hotels at least $40 cheaper per night.   
PARKING- VALET! It's worth it.  Valet is $20\/day but unlimited come and go. Plus you're right in front of the casino and hotel lobby.  The Valet staff is also friendly and helpful answering all your questions. 
If you self park, it's an occurrence rate meaning every time you come and go it's $12.  Plus, it's located behind and a ways from the hotel so be prepared to walk. 
CHECK IN- I guess when we arrived, so did half of the other customers. We waited in a long line for about 10 mins (not too bad).  The woman that checked us in was very helpful and friendly. She even offered to upgrade our room (for an extra $40\/night of course). 
ROOM- we got the Executive Suite with 1 king size bed and the couch has a queen fold-out bed.  
Pros: gorgeous, nice smelling, roomy, nice bath, lots of drawers, good maid service.. 
Cons: the fridge has a weight sensor so if you lift an item off the bar or from in the fridge your room gets charged.  If u put it back it doesn't matter, you still get charged. Also because of the weighted fridge, you can't use it to store any items you bought outside. So I had to keep refilling the ice bucket to keep our Starbucks drinks and bottled water cold.  The view is ok, nothing great for our ""suite"" you can see in one of my pics that there is double glass with a space in between that's illuminated so it's hard to see the LV lights because of the overhead reflection.
GYM- we didn't bother because of the fees. You pay the resort fees on top of the hotel cost and we felt we shouldn't have to pay for gym use. We didn't care to use the running path around the pools since it's a topless pool. Maybe a lot of men want to but sorry guys, not for me. 
FOOD- There's a lot of selection for room service and it's decent priced for what it is. Of course room service anywhere is marked up. If you go downstairs they have restaurants for every taste bud including Japanese food, steaks, burgers, Italian, and soul.  
CASINO- we only walked through but the workers were all very polite and nice. 
WHY 4 ??? Because the security guard was rude.  I nicely asked the direction to the restaurants and she looked at me and said ""They're all along the wall"" and she rolled her eyes at me.  I replied still innocently nice (because I wasn't going to let anyone ruin my stay) ""ok thank you, it's my first time in this hotel and I'm not familiar""... a floor worker came up to us and gave me good directions. 
If you like burgers, definitely eat at the BURGER BAR!  Amazing and instead of adding fries to each meal, get the trio appetizer and pick the starches\/sides. We couldn't even finish our fries.  The banana split was huge and yummy too. The walkover to Luxor was convenient and nice with places to eat and shop.  If you need a motor scooter, belldesk rents them in 24hr periods.  They deliver it to your room. Checkout was easy! We used the TV to checkout and didn't have to wait in the line.",2,0,0

Also, tried to extend one night stay and again we were transferred back and forth from front desk to new reservations...we finally gave up! And found out later there would have been another $25 resort fee!!
The only highlight of our stay was the beach\/pool but as listed by other Yelpers trying to find a chair is a hassle in itself unless you pay for a red chair $35 per day per chair...what a ripoff!!!

The biggest drawback was that this newish facility is at the far end of the strip, so everything else is harder to get to on foot. I soon learned to use the bus.

Started at the valet. We waited 40+ minutes at the valet just to check our car so we can register into the hotel.

After that we waited 2 hours in line at the front desk to check into the room.

We tried to do the mobile check in while in line to try to speed things up only to get a message that they don't have any rooms available and to talk to a representative. So the entire time in line we have anxiety about something happening to our rooms.

Once we get everything settled we rush to the buffet at 8pm so we can make it to take advantage of the free buffet we were supposed to have that day. We were looking forward to it after a very long drive and waits we had. We wait in line for 40ish minutes only to be told that we won't make it in time and had to leave. Didn't they not see a huge line building up?

After we go eat elsewhere and get back to our room early enough to put our small kids to bed we realized there are no extra sheets, blanket or pillows!!! We had already check in getting know it's 4 of us but yet the room is not set up that way. So we called to get those items to be able to out the kids to sleep. We waited and waited and an hour later we called again and asked to expedite. After another hour and two extremely tired and grumpy children later we called again. We find out that there is no record of us calling ever let alone the two times we did so the lady says. 
There was no apology when they didn't find any record of us calling and an almost accusatory tone that we never called in the first place. 
A few minutes after we hung up with the third rep we spoke they finally brought our stuff up so we immediately made the bed and put the kids to sleep and of course they passed out right away. About 20 minute later we get a call that woke my 2 year old to let us know there is someone outside with we have requested!!!! What? I thought they didn't have any records of the previous calls?! Also we have the DO NOT DISTURB sign up for a reason!!!!

People snortin coke, drinking to toxic levels and screwing in bathrooms. The stuff dreams are made of and the stuff you just knew if mom and dad found about, they'd be so proud.

So we are tearing it up and hanging out near this glass table in the livingroom area and after a night of people dancing on the table (among other things), one poor guy sat down and set his drink ever so gently on the table and the thing shattered.

Stayed in a suite on the 8th floor overlooking the pool area. WOW! The room was clean, spacious, and fairly modern. The bed was super comfortable! Bathroom was large and clean and we even had a shower and SPA bathtub. We ran the jets a bit to get the dirt out though. Had a tv near the bed and in the bathroom facing the spa. We had a family in the room next to us. Kinda sucked because we could hear their kids crying  A LOT and through the night. Luckily, the room is big and it muffles it a bit.

Spent most of my days there on the Beach Level. There was a variety of pools and spas. A lazy river with waterfall which was fun but TINY and short. The tubes from the Beach area were $25 bucks. Try to bring your own if you can. LOVED the wave pool (its a low and slow wave compared to one I've been too in Sacramento). There are cabanas and seating areas for reserving. The pool chairs that were white (non reserve) were so hard to find without people's towels and stuff on it. Also, when I did leave my beach bag of snacks and towel someone moved it and sat on it anyways. So no guarantee that you stuff will be respected. =P

Heard the buffet wasn't good so I didn't check it out. The Mandalay Shopping area was cool to check out. Had a really tasty (yet expensive) burger at Burger Bar in this area.

The line to check in was really long, but at least you get free water! It was like a 15 minute wait to check in. One of the hotels definitely suited for families since there was kids everywhere.

FYI:  the RESORT FEE isn't for amenities like wi-fi. I worked in city real estate and they charge those fees to help pay for the government bonds they used to make adjustments to the property. For example, the fancy tram (in the hotel) we took to Luxor and Excalibur. Or the extension for Mandalay Place to have shops and maybe even to pay for the parking structure.

Now, I'm not saying ""I would pass up a suite at another hotel if someone paid for it"" but when you're not on a balls-out professional sports player budget, the rooms at Mandalay Bay are the best for a normal person's price range. They are always clean which I really appreciate, and they just feel nice, not dingy or old or gross. The whole hotel feels like it's well-kept unlike some other ones I've stayed in.
I love the pool, even if it's busy it's still nice to go down for a drink and wade around in the water to cool off. My favorite Cirque show is at Mandalay (One), the convention center houses the Barrett-Jackson auction I come to, and the casino has the games I like to play.
The views are really great at Mandalay because it's at the very south end of the strip, so if you're in a strip view room you can see all the way down (which is especially cool at night with all the lights on the strip).

However you make your reservation (online or phone) make sure to print out or keep every single document you can get your hands on and make sure EVERYTHING is correct before you complete it. Because if something is wrong (dates, misspelled names, etc) you are  screwed. On one occasion we called 4 different times, as well as emailing , to try to correct my name on a reservation and it never got fixed, even though after every call the customer service rep told us it was handled. To add to the situation, when we checked-in and it was wrong, we got attitude from the guy at the front desk because it was wrong! 

On a separate occasion, we had to pay for an extra night because the reservation was wrong but we didn't print out the original online confirmation so we didn't have any proof. Not having that confirmation page was a very costly mistake.

You want to know why, because we stayed at Mandalay Bay before and got a two beds with no smoking. 

Too exhausted to complain my husband gave me the go ahead take it look. We went to the room and the smell was awful. Didn't even offer us a room spray. All night it smelled like someone was smoking inside our room. My son didn't stop coughing and of course it triggered his asthma.

Frustrated with that we called the front desk. When the engineer (Ronnie who had sympathy for the situation we were dealing with and was as helpful as possible) arrived to our room he informed us the hotel had a pipe break five days prior to our arrival and not only could he not fix the water issue in our room, he said he had notified the hotel managers to not have anyone placed in two specific rooms due to water issues. Which was room 6303 (the room we were placed in) and room 6305. The engineer expressed to us we would have to be placed in a new room because the issue was unfixable. As the hotel was ""completely booked"" for the first night, we were unable to be placed in a new room till the next day. After being aware we weren't going to be able to shower after a long tiring day, we were forced to sleep in our filth. The woman we spoke to at the front desk, Victoria was somewhat helpful but the only compensation she could give to us was a refund on the resort fee and a 75 dollar credit to be used at the hotel. The next morning we spoke to the manager and we expressed that the compensation they offered was unfair. Like seriously, what a deal I get a refund of 60 dollars when I paid over 600.00 to stay there for those two nights? How about just a refund for the first nights stay considering our room was pretty much not up to par with live able conditions. Also the bathtub had dirt in it! And let's not forget our mini fridge was locked and we couldn't get it open! The managers name was Ashley and when we spoke to her she began by saying ""oh the room with low water pressure"" NO it was the room with the tub that had NO water at all and the shower that had DRIPPING water! Also, when we expressed how we felt about the issue she had the nerve to cut us off as we were talking and she even rolled her eyes at us and told us she felt our refund of the resort fee and 75 dollar credit was enough. With a 300.00 a night room we expected more than a 60 dollar refund. Also, when we were finally advised that they had a new room available for us to move to the man helping us at the front desk gave us a one time entry key to our old room so we could get our belongings but when we got to the room, the key didn't work! After all this, we were speechless. After calling from the phone by the elevator and having to wait 20 minutes the security guard finally arrived and it took him ANOTHER 20 minutes to verify us. He said he had to verify they didn't already put someone else in this room.. Mind you this room didn't even have working water! But wait, our belongings were STILL in this room! The whole situation was ridiculous and the service was horrible and they had no sympathy for the issue. They should have checked this room before placing anyone in it and we had to waste our time dealing with this issue. Needless to say, I will never be returning to this hotel and I will never recommend anyone to stay here. Thanks for a horrible stay!",2,1,1

Nice lobby, great meeting areas, and the pool\/resort areas are the highlight.  Everything about the hotel seems to be well maintained.  Now for some of the lows.  We ended booking the hotel through Hyatt.  Somehow, even though we are here for three nights, they could not link the three nights, which means that we have to check in three seperate times and get different keys every time.  I have never had to this in any other hotel. (I had booked a one night stay followed by a two night stay).  Room has a very nice view but was not fond of cheesepuffs under the bed, behind the dresser, and never mind the 6 inch spiked heels left under the bed.  Also not find of having to call three times and wait 40 minutes for some shampoo and towels.  So a 5 star to the property but so far a 1 star on personnel.  I hope next two nights are better.

Things I Liked:

Location - We had a great view of the entire strip from our strip view room. Far enough away from the action to feel laid back yet a conveiniently located next to Luxor, Exaclibur, NYNY, and MGM. Cab ride to the Venetian cost us $13 and we don't do a lot of walking in Vegas anyway so I loved the location.

Atmosphere in the Casino - Way better ventilated and less smoky than others. Quiet but not dead. No go-go dancers on weekends like some of the others. 

Rooms - Our room was spacey, beds were comfy, and had no noise from neighbors. There was a suite down at the end of the hallway that was pretty loud one night but we couldn't hear them from our room. Nice tub, rainfall showerhead, TWO sinks and a huge counter, TV in the bathroom. 

Pool - Pool WAS crowded but it's a really nice pool area and it's really popular. There are three regular pools, the beach and wave pool, and the lazy river. We didn't bother with the beach because it was super crowded and I'm from CA...if I want waves I'll go to the real beach. But the regular pool was nice and spacious, service at the pool was great, lazy river was really fun, and they were playing rock music on the speakers near us and not annoying hip hop! Win!

Starbucks in the casino. 

Buffet was decent. Not the best I've had but pretty good for the price. 



Things I Didn't Like:

Service at the Desk: Registration for check in was SLOW. Not enough people helping and every single person checking in had a problem. They weren't rude but it seemed really unorganized and like they didn't have their crap together. Same deal with check out. We didn't have a problem with our room but huge lines and everyone was having issues. However, this is my only big complaint and it's not enough to deter me from staying again. 

WIFI: WIFI worked but was slow at times. 


Things Other Yelpers Complained About That I Thought Were Ok:

Elevators: Sometimes there were crowded, especially on Sunday around check out time, but I never encountered the dreaded waits other Yelpers complained about. They really weren't an issue. 

Staff Rudeness: We didn't encounter one rude staff member. The front desk people were disorganized and a little unprofessional but everyone we encountered during our stay was nice and helpful. 

Restaurants: Granted we only tried the buffet and the House of Blues but we had good experiences at both. Food isn't gourmet but it wasn't garbage. 

Resort Fee: It clearly states more than once when you are making a reservation on the website that there is a resort fee. When you check in, they tell you there is a resort fee. Why is this such a suprise?

Mini Bar Charges: They warn you about the sensitivity of the mini bar when you check in. When you check out, if you see charges on your bill and you didn't touch it, they'll take it off. I saw it happen to the people in front of me. Yes, it's kind of stupid but I don't know why people are freaking out about this. 


Bedding\/Carpet\/Towel Complaints: The hotel does not look rundown or beat up at all. Yes the towels had a weird coffee\/bleach smell to them but come on people! It isn't the Ritz! It's towels. 

All in all I would definitely stay here again!",7,0,3

The room rates are about 1\/3 of everywhere else on the strip for that reason alone. We were located a bit further south than I would care to be, but you can just hop in a cab or take the tram. Our room seemed a bit dated, but I did enjoy the large tub and all the counter space in the bathroom. We had a view of the airport\/mountains and at night you can definitely hear the traffic noise, even being several floors up. Room service is awesome for breakfast, but any other time of day it's lame! You're limited on what you order and it comes packaged in to go boxes, brought to you in a bag. 
The spa was heaven. I spent 2 whole days just relaxing in there. The facial I had left my skin glowing and I had the most relaxing massage. Be sure to spend time in the eucalyptus steam room and the different temperature spa baths. 
The casino floor isn't too confusing and it's easy to navigate around. The main bar we ended up meeting everyone at was Eye Candy. It's centrally located and easy for people to find. There's a ton of restaurants on the way to the convention center, as well as a mall area with smaller bars and places to grub. We went to The Light one night- it's nice to have a club in the casino! As well as hitting the Foundation room and rooftop area for photo ops. 
The manager of the poker room was amazing- she helped us organize a big poker tournament for the guys we traveled with- complete food, a carving station and drinks. We went by there again before we left to head back home and the man friend hit a royal flush. I've never seen that happen :)

From the minute we walked in the front door, we were accommodated, greeted and settled in a beautiful room overlooking the strip that was comfortable, convenient, quiet, beautiful and gave us the space to truly relax. The space was tastefully decorated-- that was gracious and accommodating.

We discovered the beach and spent time in between sessions, sitting by the Lazy River, delighting in the scene of happy people getting some sun and enjoying their time in the water. Take your suits as there are so many water experiences that can be folded into your time in Las Vegas.

There are lots of eating options at different levels of formality and price. We enjoyed Citizens as well as it was quick, delicious and like home....though we had a terrific plate of nachos with drinks at the Border Grill, and a really nice dinner at Lupo . The BurgerBar has great burgers and the staff is very attentive. We had a great lunch at the Guiness Bar (Chopped Salad for me, burger for my son) --price and quality were great.

It's just hype, and I'm not sure the hype is all that and a bag of chips, either.   Yes, Mandalay Bay is contrived hype, with a stale premise for manipulation.

* Convention Center.  Lots of natural lighting when possible so you don't feel like you're caged up in hell. Clean facilities, considerate staff.  Now if they could just figure out a way to make the room temperature more human friendly so that I don't feel like I want to shrivel up and die before the vampires get me.  

* Restaurants: Meh, I've had better.  If you are going to dine finely, go to Aria for the hot new menus.  The restaurants in Mandalay Bay embody the ignorant Americanism that is Vegas - boring, ethnocentric, and bland.

*Rooms: Egad Watson! These rooms suck. The pictures and the crap lighting create the perception of a nicely designed room, but it's all a house of cards underneath.  Bed sheets that don't fit properly, bath towels that feel like sandpaper against your skin, a cruel lack of bathroom countertop, chipped paint, and lame water pressure.

What I loved about this place:
1. The ""Beach"" It's huge. THEY HAVE SAND! The sand has a ton of lawn chairs and faces the wave pool. They also have a lazy pool (bring your own inner tube it is $20 to rent theirs) that is relaxing. There are several other pools with lawn chairs. There are some areas where you can find shade without being under a cabana but not many. I have been to other hotels where there is not one tree by the pool.
2. The rooms are nice and comfortable with a double sinks in the bathroom. If you are there with your girlfriends you appreciate the double sinks. The bathroom also has a soaking tub in addition to a shower.
3. The restaurants that are connected to the hotel are great. Burger Bar has a happy hour with half off mojitos. The House of Blues has a great breakfast menu. You almost don't have to leave the hotel.

I would have easily given this hotel five stars if it wasn't for the mistake with billing. I reserved my room online with a AAA discount and paid the deposit. When I checked in I paid the remaining balance which included the $28\/day resort fee. The money was taken out of my account immediately. When I checked my account two days later the money was back in but the resort fee was out. When I called and spoke to a representative at the front desk the gentleman told me that they were holding an extra $125 for incidentals which I informed them I did not need at check in. He told me that if he released the extra being charged it may hold my account up for double the cost. The next day I went to the lobby and spoke to a woman at the front desk who was not apologetic at all. She actually told me that I could have dinner in the hotel for the extra $125 that was being held on my card. All I wanted was to be charged the correct amount. She then told me that her manager would tell me the same thing so there was no need to speak to her. Of course I asked to speak to her manager who fixed the extra charges. I just wish I didn't have to waste time on the phone a couple times and in person trying to get this corrected.

It is a GORGEOUS hotel, absolutely radiates a feeling of elegance and richness.  The staff were very nice and helpful.  I requested a room near the elevators as I have a bad knee and bad back and they were very accomodating.  Check in was a breeze-- guess we caught a 'down time"" and were were the only ones there.  One big problem for me:  I can only be upright for about 5 minutes before my back hurts like heck.  There was NO seating, no chairs, nothing in the lobby or nearby for quite a ways.  My back was killing me by the time we checked in.  Walking from Point A to Point B within the Hotel and Casino, I also wished there was seating available at least somewhere, it was very uncomfortable for my back.  Get some benches or seats!

We scored a really low rate on Priceline, and had a room with 2 queen beds (our 17 yr. old son was with us).  Room was very spacious and pretty.  DOWNSIDES:   Our ""view"" was of a Motel 6 across the street and a souvenir store.  Not very pretty.  

Airconditioning did not seem to work at full capacity (I was always warm in the room).  The room design was actually very stupid...   the bathroom is just next to (on the side of) the beds.  It had two swinging louvred doors, which had to be fully closed or fully opened.  If one person got up in the middle of the night to pee, the door made a horrible noise opening it up, and also the light in the bathroom would then shine on the beds, waking up your travel companions.  We did not like that at all!

And as someone else mentioned, the maid was there at 8am, chomping at the bit to get in the room.  Egads, we sleep in on vacation.  We had forgotton to put out the ""do not disturb"" sign.  But every morning, we felt she was breathing down our necks to get in the rooms and clean.

We were given a $100 credit towards getting a Pool Gazebo, which we did for one of the days we were there, and it was fabulous.  You have the ""tent"" Gazebo, a table and chairs for eating; 3 private lounge chairs, a flat screen TV, all the ice and water you want, free use of two pool floats, shade, privacy and a great place to hang out right by the pools.

The pool area is gorgeous... But.  The ""lazy river"" was so SMALL!  The one at MGM is about 5 times longer.  This one was so small, that all the people using the river were bumping and banging against each other.  The ""Sandy beach"" had chairs only about 2"" apart, and you were not allowed ot have food or drinks in there.  The wave pool was okay, but the waves were pretty tame and not so fun.  And the pool area was so darned FAR from the hotel... I enjoyed it, but not as much as I had anticipated from reading about it.

Because the Mandalay is so isolated and far down the Strip, it is not at all convenient to go to other casinos\/restaurants.  it is also lacking any interesting views.   One thing we liked:  the two levels for traffic coming in and out of the hotel.  The upper level by the front door is ""drop off"";  for leaving the hotel, getting a cab to go out, waiting for your rental car from Valet parking, etc., you use the lower, pool level.  This greatly minimized traffic backups and hassles that other casinos have at their front entrances.  

At checkout, we found my husband qualified for $100 credit in food\/drink.  As we were at the end of our stay, the person at the desk said ""never mind, I will just give you a $100 credit off your bill"":  Now that was great and appreciated!

I booked a deluxe king room with a strip view two-and-a-half months before our trip. I also requested early check-in as well as late check-out to make the most out of our stay. Because I was assured that early check-in meant I could have my room as early as 10am, my fiancé and I took an early flight, and arrived at about 10:30. After we navigated the super confusing lobby and checked in, we were told the maid was currently in the room cleaning. We were given two options, wait or have a room with two queen beds. We said we'd wait for the king room, under the impression it wouldn't be a long wait. We were told we'd receive a call when the room was ready, encouraged to go have lunch and our bags were taken to the bell desk. We were also told that if we had finished lunch and still hadn't received a phone call to come back to the desk and check on the status of our room. 

Surprise surprise, by 12:30pm I still hadn't gotten a call. My fiancé and I went back to find out what was going on. We spoke with another person, who told us the room was not ready and that the previous person should have never guaranteed us the room by a certain time. He wasn't all that friendly and didn't seem to care how frustrated we were. Had I known I still wouldn't be in my room at noon, I would have booked a later flight. 

Given no other options, we were left to just wait around for the maids to get around to cleaning our room. Again, they'd known I was coming and wanting early check-in for over two months! They couldn't have had it ready?? According to Mr. Unfriendly, because check-out time is at 11, they can't guarantee early check-in. Then why make it an option to your guests!?

2:30pm and still no call. By now other guests are arriving and checking in no problem. My fiancé had had enough and went to demand we be given our room. As he was waiting in line I FINALLY received a call from an equally unfriendly woman, informing me my room was ready before hanging up on me. Rude. I pulled my fiancé out of the ridiculously long check-in line and we went up to our room. I tried calling down to the bell desk to have our bags brought up several times but they never even answered their phones. My fiancé was so mad, he just went back down and got our luggage himself. 

It's unfortunate a great hotel is staffed by such uncaring, unfriendly people. I think they could all benefit from some customer service training. Next time we go to Vegas we'll be staying somewhere else for sure.",3,1,1

I guess it helps that the Four Seasons Las Vegas is attached to Mandalay Bay. My room was great! A plush king size bed, his & hers closets which light up inside when the doors open, and the desk is fitted into a corner with a banquette-type couch on one side and an office chair on the other. I was in Vegas for a conference yet really enjoyed just getting to catch up on work in my hotel room.

A huge plus was I had the nicest bathroom ever with a steam shower, deep soaking tub, makeup mirror, TV, phone, the works! My first night after some industry mixers I came back to my room and took a bubble bath plus enjoyed some TV. That's my version of working hard in playing hard in Vegas.

I agree with the other reviews: if you're going to club it's a pain in the butt because cab rides will add up. One night I has to hop around for vendor parties going from my hotel to Marquee @ Cosmopolitan then to Pure @ Caesar's then back to my hotel and it was $60 for all the cabs. Meh.

To get a nice change of place, head over to Verandah on The Four Seasons side. It's a beautiful oasis in the busy casino. I met a few folks for a late lunch there one afternoon and it was lovely to just sit outside, getting away from the casino recycled air conditioning. 

The casino, restaurants, and other amenities are above average for Las Vegas.

The check-in process was smooth, we got a room on the 5th floor with a view of the pool area and strip, the non-smoking rooms were very clean and spacious, the only downside was how far it was from the center of the strip - so it made going to other establishment a bit more time consuming even with a car (avoid visiting during weekends on all costs - traffic is everywhere!). 

I thoroughly enjoyed the bathtub and the design of the rooms. Very open floor plan with carpets in the bed area and granite\/marble in the bathrooms.

We got a great deal on a suite because of the time of year - great view of the city and lots of space! I would recommend booking when it's cold.. doesn't make a difference in Vegas anyway since you're just going to be indoors most of the time, and you'll get a much better deal!

Pros:

Room was spacious 

Foundation Room (lounge) was fun and had a great vibe. It also has a great view of Vegas, and it was free to get in. 

This hotel\/resort is HUGE and has lots to do, so the night we stayed here we didn't even go into the rest of Vegas. We'd also been to Vegas many times before though, so didn't feel we needed to. Lots of shopping and places to go out in Mandalay Bay and Luxor (which connects to Mandalay Bay).

Good place for families, as their is the shark reef and connects to Luxor and Excaliber, which both have good family entertainment.

Friendly staff.

Cons: 

Kind of far from the center of the Strip if you're wanting to explore. But there's a monorail, so not a big deal.

We checked in early and since we had a suite our room wasn't ready, which was understandable. But when 3 pm rolled around it still wasn't ready, and we were left waiting in the lobby until after 4 for our room (we wanted to put our stuff way before going out).

We ate at their cafe and it was only okay, but kind of pricey for what they give you.

We stayed here for 7 nights.  The staff is very friendly. Everyone calls you by your name, the rooms are pretty nice when you walk in, the bathroom is almost the same size as the room. The decor is nice too.  The bed is cozy.

I have only two issues.

The airport is so close to the hotel.  Our view was actually that of the airport.   So you hear planes landing and taking off 24\/7, it's really loud (and I live next to a freeway).  Also, something was going on with the plumbing, in the middle of the night, the sinks would make a very loud draining noise.  It seemed like if someone below us used water, it did something to the pressure with the drains.  After the first night, I got some ear plugs at the store  and I could sleep through the night.

Secondly, there were two days where house keeping never attended our room.  When I called to order towels and talk to someone about it, they told me It was my job to call and remind them to clean the room.    Pretty odd that they needed a reminder.

Thumbs up:

- decent rooms: okay size, nice bathroom with extra toilet and jacuzzi bath tub
- layout: quick access to elevators, front desk, casino. Only the parking garage is a bit of a walk
- night club and bars: Lights and Minus 5 Ice Bar are in the building
- wifi included in the resort fee

Thumbs down:

- dining options: some overpriced and less than average sandwich\/diners, no decent brunch option
- beach: while the pool area is large and has a wave simulator, it is crowded and full of kids. In other words: great for families
- only a few stores, not much shopping options

I personally didn't mind the location that much - the hotel is located on the South end of the Strip. Cab ride to the Venetian is about $15, to the airport $16.

We have a queen at home, and don't bump into each other, unless we try ;-)

Moved into a King bed and at least the size of the bed is accurate.  However, the mattresses are extremely uncomfortable and the pillows feel like they had rocks in them.  And what is it with not having a fitted sheet on the bed?  Or at least a tucked sheet that doesn't come off when you pull back the sheets.

Another horrendous problem I experienced has to do with my toothbrush.  It was moved from place to place in the bathroom each day.  Housekeeping put it into the travel container, on a towel, laying on the counter, etc. I called front desk and housekeeping. They didn't seem to think it was a big deal.  I did!

Did the person cleaning the room clean the toilet before she touched my toothbrush? Or someone elses for that matter?

We decided to make a quick getaway to unwind.  There was a choice of three hotel specials, the most expensive of which was Mandalay Bay.  Well, we have always wanted to stay there and decided to make the plunge & book it.

We left early on Friday, Aug 24th to beat the check in crowd.  We arrived there around 12pm and the lobby  was PACKED!  There had to be over 100 people in line to check in.  There were only four windows open to handle this crowd.  They actually rolled a beverage cart to the lobby and were selling beer to people as they waited in line.  I couldn't help but think that maybe they ought to pull the beer guy off and put him behind the counter.  We waited 45 minutes to check in.  When finally reached the counter we were offered a ""room upgrade"" for $30.  I asked if she had a view suite and was told yes, so we decided to go for it.

We got to our room & the 1st room key didn't work.  We messed with the 2nd one a few times & finally got the door open.  Our ""View Suite"" only had half a window...with a view of the roof!  We didn't want to wait in that line again-just wanted to get to the pool so we decided to deal with it & unpacked.  At first glance, the room looked pretty nice.  I changed into my bathing suit and walked barefoot across the carpet.  It was damp & sticky!  I grabbed my flip flops and began to notice that the whole carpet was stained & spotted, with ""traffic marks"" everywhere.  The sofa was stained & dirty as well.  There was hair stuck in the bedspread, and dust and trash all around the platform bed.  The clock radio\/ipod dock didn't work, the jacuzzi had broken jets, and the ice machine was broken on my floor. 

Long story short, we were terribly disappointed with our stay.  This hotel needs some TLC, and for the prices they charge it's NOT worth it.   I did call the Front Desk Manager upon check out and she did credit us our ""Resort Fee"" and the room upgrade, but I still have the $462 bill to pay Sears for the original booking...I could have stayed twice as long at another hotel.",8,1,0

Our secretary made reservations for 10 people and I was the only one who was not checked in promptly. Apparently the front desk Attendant had no idea how to process a check in where there had been a pre-payment. I was asked if I could call the person who made the original reservation, which is entirely unreasonable based on the fact we arrived after 7pm Las Vegas time and I had stated to her that I had flown all day from Richmond, VA just to get there. She left me multiple times while the two people I had traveled in with had both been checked in and were waiting for me.

It was extremely frustrating that after traveling for 7 hours the front desk personnel was unable to check me in for over 30 minutes.

But that's not the end of the saga. I expressed my unhappiness during my check-in via social media and received a follow-up call the next day. Unfortunately I was there for a convention and was booked the entire trip. I expressed this and was asked for an email address to follow up. This all sounds good, right? Except that I never received an email after being asked for my address and only AFTER I expressed my unhappiness was I contacted.

The 1st email I received was filled with untrue statements about their attempts to assist and the tone was quite offensive. I received a second email from a different person with an entirely different tone, asking for the details on my experience. Sounds good again, right?

After several days of correspondence I was asked for a phone number where I could be reached after 7pm my time. I provided it and confirmed my availability and received no call. This has now happened TWICE where I have adjusted plans to be available for calls that never come.

The most unfortunate part is that I was very excited about staying at Mandalay Bay prior to my arrival and had excellent meals while I was there.

When we walked in the room we discovered disheveled beds, suitcases, etc. WTH? Come to find out they gave us the wrong room! Luckily the room belonged to our other friends, but what if it was a stranger? What if we walked in and got attacked? We luckily got our rooms straightened out, an apology from the manager and one night comped, but still it is very disappointed that it happened.

It may have been a great hotel back in the day, but it is definitely not a great hotel, and is probably only staying afloat because of all the concerts that are held at the hotel.

I reserved a suite for one night here as I really wanted the jacuzzi tub. I was told all the suites were amazing and very nice and that I was lucky to snag the deal that I did.  Okay...fine...I may not have believed her 100% but I went with it.

Checking in to the hotel, we were supposed to receive a $50 dining credit for the hotel. Upon receiving it, we were told that it wasn't exactly a free dining credit but rather that we'd have to spend a certain amount of money in order to get a $50 discount on food\/drinks.

We get to the room....not so nice....""lovely"" view of the parking lot...and not much else.   The carpets are filthy and the sofa has stains all over it! I refused to walk around barefoot.  

The bathroom was semi-nice...the jacuzzi tub worked and was clean.

Ten minutes after getting to our room, I got ready to take a shower and was in a state of undress when all of a sudden, there's a knock at the door (literally ONE knock). I wasn't sure if I had heard correctly, but before I could even do anything about it, I hear the door open!

I immediately start yelling and I hear the lady with a heavy accent merely say ""OH!"" and eventually shut the door behind her!

All the staff were extremely friendly and very helpful whenever I had any questions. They go above and beyond their job requirements. They always made me feel welcome. The rooms are gorgeous! At first I was kinda bummed that Mandalay is so far back on the strip but the room made up for that. I love the bathrooms! They are huge and very pretty. It has a tv in the bathroom too! I was able to watch the UK VS Florida game while getting ready for dinner. The beds were extremely comfortable too. I don't sleep very well and I'm the type that brings my own personal pillows because of how picky I am. I didn't even bother to get my pillow out of my bag! I went to sleep within 10-15 minutes and that's without the influence of alcohol. The casino is nice and feels really new but I recommend going somewhere else. Even on Saturday night with the hunting convention staying at the hotel, there wasn't as many people as I thought there would be. Mandalay casino is like night and day compared to the casinos down town. I felt like I was at a retirement home in Mandalay's casino. It's too quiet. No one seemed excited and I never heard any machines going off either. I highly recommend going elsewhere if you want to gamble unless you enjoy a quiet casino. There's a free tram to Excalibur so I couldn't dock this reason from the rating. MGM is also a hop and a skip from Excalibur too. The restaurants are on the pricey end at Mandalay but I had excellent food and service there. We ate at Kumi Japanese and it was great! I wouldn't eat at Mandalay for all your meals but the nicer restaurants are great to spoil yourself. I also got a chance to experience the spa as well. OMG IT WAS AWESOME!!!! I did the fully body massage after having too much fun on a ATV tour and it was amazing! I felt so much better and it was totally worth the money. Like everything else at Mandalay Bay, it's on the pricey end, but the service that you get makes it totally worth it.  


SUMMARY: 

Mandalay Bay is a perfect place to stay if you're looking to spoil yourself. This is a affordable higher end type of hotel. Are you going to save a lot of money staying here? **giggles** Heck no! It's definitely worth staying at. The little things at this hotel made my experience that much better for me. Since everything is a little bit pricey, I recommend gambling and eating somewhere else. Excalibur has a lot of places to eat that are cheaper and there's a free tram that you can take over there. The reason why I gave it a perfect 5 stars is due to the service, excellent hotel rooms, and hands down an excellent experience I had there. Although pricey, it's worth the stay and I felt like I got my money worth!  



Pros: 

EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE EVERYWHERE! (Spa, front desk, bell hop, restaurants, everywhere! They go above and beyond customer service here!) 

Rooms were very nice! 

Bathrooms are spacious and very clean. This made my room worth the money 

Hotel was very clean overall 

Spa! Need I say anymore? 

Kumi was an excellent restaurant and great experience 

Plenty to do at the Hotel: Shows, Aquarium, Casino, Beach, Pool, Spa,...the list goes on 

Free Tram Ride to Excalibur 

Close to The Airport 

Bell Hop will keep your bags for you until you are ready to leave for the airport if you have a later flight after check out    



Cons: 

A bit on the pricey side for the room and everything that you do. If you are staying on a budget I would look elsewhere but I felt that it was worth the extra money to stay here which is why I didn't dock it from the rating.

Casino was too quiet for me. Hardly any machines going off and the crowd made it feel like a retirement home. That's with the hunting convention staying there too. I personally prefer to go down town or to Excalibur but this is just a personal preference. It wasn't a ""bad"" casino. Just wasn't for me. Some people are into quieter casinos.",0,0,0

The restaurants were VERY disappointing!! OVER PRICED and the food was not great. The Red Room had the best food and the Citizens had the best breakfast choices.

It wasn't necessarily a last minute trip, but we had a bit of difficulties trying to find a hotel that would allow dogs. lol. I don't remember what hotel we went to first, but over the phone they told us that they allowed dogs and when we got there, they told us no pets. It was quite frustrating. Not only had my car overheated but then this. So we kept driving around in about 115 degree heat in the middle of summer just getting really really tired of driving.

Finally after about 3 other places we finally came here and they said they allowed small dogs. We were in luck. I think we actually got a pretty good deal too. The room was nice and it overlooked the strip and you could see a nearby airport across the way. I loved their large windows and just sat there on the floor looking out just admiring the lights and traffic etc. Yeah I'm weird like that. My dog sat with me which was kind of funny since I thought she might not like the height we were at. It was really packed with people down on the strip and there were a lot of hotel room parties going on. Walls are kind of thin or they just had the music way loud. Then again, they seemed to be talking in normal tones, but you could hear the majority of their conversations, which I particularly didn't like. 

The service was good and the rooms were cleanly compared to other places I've been to. This was my second trip to Vegas with my family in years. I didn't go into the casino area since I was underage at the time and spent most of the night with my camera outside taking pictures along the strip. That was actually pretty nice. There were a lot of the people handing out cards and the sidewalk was littered with them. 

Anyways, going off topic but the beds were very comfortable and I think we had room service cause everywhere we went was packed and we didn't want to deal with it. The food was good and service was prompt. I somehow missed the fireworks, but they probably had a decent view lol. I was just really happy that they allowed dogs. We didn't want to leave her alone at home while we were going to be away for a couple days. So they saved us from a disaster. :)",0,1,0

Overall could've been 4 or even 5 stars, but some cleanliness issue bumped it down to 3. :(

I stayed at Mandalay Bay this past April to celebrate my birthday with the boyfriend. We stayed in a Deluxe Room, and originally had planned on a 1 king bedroom, but since they had none available on the higher floors, we just opted for 2 queens. 

Mandalay Bay is definitely one of the nicer hotels I've stayed at. The room looked very spacious, and the bathroom was gorgeous (and huge!!). If you look at the pictures from the website, you'll see that the bathroom has a glass shower, bubble soaking tub, twin vanities, 15"" LCD TV, and stone surface everywhere. The bathroom was easily my favorite part about the room, because everything just looked so beautiful. The room itself comes equipped with his\/hers closets, nice comfy beds, 42"" plasma TV, seating couches, etc. I loved the decor and feel of the overall room as well. HOWEVER, when I plopped on one of the beds, I noticed that there were some brown leaves under the pillow..and I am not going to venture a guess as to what that was. It was gross, needless to say, and made me feel uneasy about how clean the beds actually were. It was pretty late, so we didn't feel like talking to the front desk. Reading the reviews, it seemed like a past customer also had a similar experience. I just hope that Mandalay Bay is more careful about these kind of things, because the rooms are amazing, but I'd hate for this to be a common occurrence. It also makes me hesitate as to whether I would return unfortunately.. even though I'm in love with the rooms. :(

The perk of the visit, however, was when checkout day came and my lazy bum couldn't wake up for the 11am deadline. My boyfriend called to arrange for a late checkout, and they offered us a complimentary 12pm extension. This was very appreciated, and I'm not sure if this is a common thing, since I know it wasn't a compensation for our dirty bed situation. Regardless, I thought that was very nice of them, so bonus points for service and hospitality!

Overall, I enjoyed my stay at Mandalay Bay. The hotel was beautiful, and it really made me feel like I was living the luxurious life in Vegas. However, I'm not sure how  I feel about our beds possibly being overlooked during cleaning, especially for the price we were paying. If something that obviously dirty went unnoticed, what else could they have missed?? Just a thought.",2,2,1

It's just that I don't go to Vegas all too very much. But after planning for a Vegas trip, I looked at the myVegas rewards, and for some odd reason, I could book a free room at Mandalay Bay on Valentine's Day (with President's Day being the next day). Yes a free room! On 2\/14. I was thoroughly impressed and I was like ""there's gotta be catch"".

So we went to the front desk and I presented the myVegas voucher (REMEMBER IT'S $15 FOR A PHONE RESERVATION) after claiming it via MLife Rewards (I sold my soul to mLife- sorry!). The person behind the desk was very nice and she quickly gave a room that was in the middle (with a view of the strip). Mandalay Bay is kinda far from the main part of the strip (2 blocks) but it's not too bad :P 

The room itself was dimly lit and was really dependent on how bright the sun came in. Yes there were lights in the room but it didn't really illuminate it all too very much. It helps at night but it's not fully bright as you really want it to be. The beds are softer than usual beds and your back may or may not hurt a little bit :P They give 4 pillows and the decorative circular thingy whose name escapes me right now.

With the bathroom, BAM no privacy. If anyone is laying on the bed, they can see you- and almost all of you. You can close the door :P There's a huge tub, a really small shower, and a bathroom with a door, along with TWO sinks! YAY. The mirror looks really nice. Taking a shower here is no bueno though, because of the fact that the water is colddddd. It's hot for about 30 seconds and then gets cold. :P

Ummmm I can say more about the hotel but I didn't really explore too too much. The parking garage is a good walk from the casino :P They also have restaurants inside the casino to eat at, and the Shoppes at Mandalay Place. But that is for another review.. PLUS it connects to Luxor, so you can walk around each casino and shopping area even if it's pouring cats and dogs outside! :) 

The hotel is nice, not in the main Strip area, but with the shower and the dim lights, it wasn't -yeah. I got the room for the resort fee only, so I personally would give it a 4 star. But most people don't have myVegas :P",14,14,15

Just kidding.

Not really. 

Anyways. The service was super. We had breakfast at a place at the hotel that served both Mimosas and among the best coffee I've had. Took the train into the strip and it was simple and hassle free. 

I LOVED the room. Two big beds, a tub, AND shower. Separate toilet. The beds were nice to sleep on and the pillows probably the best I've ever had.

Our suite was clean, the bed was SUPER comfortable and had a fantastic view of the Strip. It was a little out of date style-wise, but otherwise the room was HUGE and extremely comfortable. 

As for the casino itself -- the best part about the Mandalay is that it's a good compromise between the prim ""properness"" of the Wynn and Bellagio and the party-crazy-ness of somewhere like New York, New York. The casino is modern, has a good assortment of upscale and affordable food and also has a lot of great shops adjacent to it.

Resort fees are so the hotel can list a lower price on hotel booking sites.  My hotel room was $50 a night but then it was a resort fee $39.68 per night.  Then because it is a fee you are taxed on the fee even.  So my $50 a night price turned out to be right around $100 a night.  Still overall a good rate just a shady way to do business!

I'm not sure if this is now typical in Vegas, but I've been coming here for over 20 years and haven't been so nickel and dimed in my life! 
No coffee makers in the room- this to me is just not cool, especially in Vegas where you don't always wake up a happy camper, if you know what I mean! So the first morning I went down and grabbed just an iced coffee, nothing fancy and paid $8 plus tip. I get why give people something for free if you can get $8, especially if they're a little trapped at the resort. But again, not cool! 
My husband and I also enjoy the conveniences of a mini fridge in every junior suite we've stayed at in other hotels. We usually bring some snacks, a bottle of wine and always use it for leftovers. Well, they have a mini fridge, all right! It's actually 100% FULLY stocked with drinks and each drink is spring loaded with a sensor so if you try to take them out to make room for your leftovers or whatever, it automatically charges you for the purchase. We managed to squeeze 1 bottle of wine on the very top laying down  and then got a visit from the re-stock lady wanting to know if we needed more waters. What??? Because the weight changed, the sensor went off. She was very nice and did let us know we can call housekeeping and they'll bring us a fridge. Great! We called- $40 PER night. Grrrr!!
To top it all off, housekeeping only came once in 3 days and only then because we heard another couple that was a few doors down from us complaining to hotel staff that their room didn't get cleaned either, so we requested ours to be cleaned. I'm sorry, but that to me is one of my favorite things about staying in a hotel- to come in after a day out and have my room all nice and clean!

FOR REVIEWERS TO SAY THIS PLACE IS UPSCALE AND LUXURIOUS OR WORLD-CLASS (3rd world, maybe), TELLS ME THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN TO AN UPSCALE, LUXURIOUS, WORLD-CLASS  HOTEL. Consider the source, people.

Coming here was like a scene from a bad movie; I thought I was in Walmart on Black Friday. 

First of all, this hotel is NOT on the strip (middle of nowhere). It is far, far, FAR from the action.

 CHECK IN:  The line was sooo long it snaked around the entire lobby and moved at a snail's pace; one hour wait.

 ROOMS: The furniture is old, uncomfortable and broken. GHETTO.

 POOL:  NASTY! There were many wading pools, which all were filled with disheveled, drunken people, with drinks still in hand, who were all shouting over the 3 different types of music  (all playing at the same time). Also, there were no seats available, poolside, and trash was strewn everywhere. It looked like a Tijuana alley.

 THE CLIENTELE: 99% can be found at ""People of Walmart.com"" WARNING: They boast of having a private nude beach! Thank you for keeping it private.

 ELEVATORS: There is a line to get into these tiny, crowded (sardine style) contraptions; they are dirty and SLOW = nightmare fuel if you are on the 34th floor,since it stops at EVERY floor. We were tightly squeezed in between a loud, obese, drunken wedding party.

 SHOPPING: Uuuh, nope! Lame, unknown, shops.

 CUSTOMER SERVICE:  It was difficult to call them since the main phone (from the 80's) was broken, so I had to use the one in the bathroom. When I complained to the manager (woman) was rude and not helpful.  

 FEES: Watch out for the hidden resort fee; it will be added to your bill when you check out, about $30 extra!

OH! Look at all the one star ratings that have been filtered, for some reason!

The Pool complex at Mandalay Bay is by far the best of any Las Vegas Hotel. Mandalay Bay is a resort with a great Wave Pool, Lazy River and a bunch of other Pools. If you are a guest of the Delano they have a special Pool just for their Hotel Guests. Finding a chair is usually not an issue at Mandalay Beach because there are so many of them. Keep in mind that they really enforce the height requirements for small children in the Wave Pool. It is also a great time if you can plan your trip around a concert at Mandalay Beach. I have seen a few there now, and it is always a great time to stand on the beach or in the Wave Pool and watch a concert!! The front desk at Mandalay Bay is usually very friendly and helpful and they will usually upgrade your Room type if they can. Veranda restaurant at the Four Seasons is an amazing place for Brunch on the weekends. Crossroads at House of Blues is also good for Breakfast. There are many other great restaurants on site.  We also like Burger Bar and RM Seafood for Lunch. RM Seafood has a great tasting menu at Lunch time that is just $28 a person. They have the best Clam Chowder and Lobster Rolls I have ever had! The rooms are also very nice. Very clean and I love the Bath Tubs at Mandalay Bay. Some people complain about the location. But we have found that having the Tram that connects you to the Luxor and Excalibur makes getting around very easy. The Shark Reef Aquarium is also a nice place to take your kids. If you are traveling with your family stay and Mandalay Bay, you will love it!!!",0,0,0

The only complaint I have, and the reason I knocked off a star, relates to the front desk. Both check-in and check-out were a hassle and the staff was not at all apologetic. In fact, on check in they refused to extend our stay at the rate I was paying only to find out by calling reservations from our room that it was no problem.

The Mandalay Bay has definitely lowered their standards in what's ""high class"".  They used to be such a nice and clean hotel, they've just degraded themselves with the ""hip remodel"" of their buffet and their poor customer service\/housekeeping service.

We spent 1 night here complimentary of the casino since my father is ""V.I.P."" here or whatever.  We were given a room on the 32nd floor and the first thing we did (learning from our previous experience) was to check the bedsheets.  We flipped them open, and one bed, there were 3 strands of HAIR and the sheets looked like they had been slept in.

We went down to the V.I.P. Lounge and asked them to do something about it.  Monica didn't give us an upgrade, even though I requested one since this was not the first time this has happened to us.  She instead, tried switching us to the 8th floor.  Um, what?  No thanks.  I complained some more and she transferred us to a room with a ""great view of the strip"" on the 27th floor.  I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE VIEW.  I just want a clean bed to sleep in.

We go to our newly assigned room, and again flip open the sheets; and now there are 2 strands of hair.  I called Monica since I didn't want to go back down and she said there was nothing she could do but have the head of housekeeping come and take a look, since it happened in both rooms.  We waited forever for someone to come, and in the end, it wasn't even the head of housekeeping, but just a regular maid.  She was told that she was to come here to change our sheets - and at that time of the night, we were pretty tired so we just agreed.

Later that evening, as my mother was getting ready to go to bed, she accidentally stepped onto the carpet with her bare feet (we usually wear slippers around the room, since we're germaphobes).  She quickly raised her feet and hanging on her toe was a strand of hair.  We then realized that the ""hairy"" beds we encountered were probably NOT slept in, but new sheets just dragged on the floor when the maid was changing the old sheets and laying the new one on - which means they obviously don't vacuum the carpets.

Either way, it's disgusting.  They need a whole new lead of housekeeping staff and system, seriously.

===============================================

EDIT:  I just also remembered that the next night, after coming back to the hotel from Red Rock Conservation Park, the maid had not come by to our room to re-make our bed, re-supply us with bath products, etc.; basically in simpler terms, there was no turn-down service.  Funny, in my years of staying here, this has never happened.  Like I said above, ""They need a whole new housekeeping staff and\/or system, seriously.",11,6,5

The problem:  Don't expect Seaworld.  It's a nice place but was not worth what we paid.  The aquarium is really outdated and you can tell that all the corals and plantations in the tank were fake!

The first two nights were fine. The room was clean and nicely decorated. The pool was ok. I felt like it was kind of small and packed in.  The lazy river was more like a lazy creek because it was short. Like I said though everything was fine and acceptable until the 3rd night which went from bad to worse. 

1. Buffet was completely underwhelming. Nothing stood out as good. My kids were even disappointed.... They said they would have rather eaten at sizzler:(

2. This was the biggie. Sometime in the middle of the night we started hearing what sounded like a helicopter above our heads. It woke our entire family up. We went back to sleep, but then it woke us up again and it went through cycles. Sometimes it was louder and sometimes it was softer. Then we wondered if the laundry was above our heads and everything was on spin cycle. From about 5-9am it was almost every minute. It was impossible to sleep. Our entire family was now awake. I called guest services and complained. At this point we were all exhausted and we wanted to go home. I work nights as an RN and can't afford to come home from vacation more tired than when I started and have people's lives in my hands. It's not safe and I can't risk it. I told guest services I wanted to leave and I wanted my 3rd night comped due to whatever noise I was hearing. She stated it was not laundry and they could move me to another room where the helicopter noise should be less. I explained I didn't think it was a helicopter but that it was very loud. She offered to move me to another room for our last night. I declined and explained I could not risk another night of no sleep and if I had to pack up my family to move rooms I might as well go home. She stated she would ""waive the cancellation fee of my last night but would not comp my 3rd night"". I explained I thought that I still should not have to pay for the third night given what we had to endure, she stated I still had to pay. I was not happy. She asked if I wanted engineering to investigate. I said yes absolutely. 

Engineering came up to investigate and right away heard what we were talking about.  He said ""yes that's a very loud noise I have no idea what it is I've never heard anything like that before"". He said he would investigate and let the front desk know and come back and let us know what they were going to do. Engineering came back about 15 minutes later and said he determined it was the elevator.  He apologized and said they would get on it to get it corrected and they hope to have it fixed that day. He said he let the front desk know. I called the front desk again and plead my case to have my third night comped given what engineering had found. The front desk held firm that they would not comp my third night and would only waive the cancellation fee for my fourth night even though it was very clear what I was saying was 100% accurate and we had no sleep. Super disappointing and poor customer service in my opinion. 

Unless there was a smoking deal I probably would not stay here again just based on my 3rd night experience. I probably would stay at Fourseasons or something else a little bit more customer service oriented.

Came here 2 weeks ago, and it was my first time staying at Mandalay. I frequent vegas pretty often and was surprised I've never stayed here before, and trust me THAT will be changing after this visit! 

We stayed in a beautiful suite - the view wasn't the best but the room was spacious, the bathroom was gorgeous. Although, I was missing some luxurious bath robes! We stayed on the 21st floor so there was definitely some ""floor envy"" since it goes up to 65! But again the room was really nice and roomy and beautiful. 

There is plenty of shopping and dining options - we chose most of the quick sit down\/fast food\/food court options since we barely ate the whole weekend. However there are certainly options for everyone! Asian, Mexican, Buffets, American, French, Italian, Steakhouses... 

The pool options are also extraordinary! Whether you want to rage hard at a pool party (Daylight,) float on the lazy river or in the wave pool, lay out on the ""beach,"" or try the ""toptional"" pool ... there is something for everyone. The only downside is with the lazy river, you have to PURCHASE your floaty tube. There are no rental options. Floaties are $20 for a small one (kid sized, or really skinny\/petite person) and $24 for a large one. You can still go into the lazy river w\/o one, but its obviously more fun on a tube. I would try asking a neighbor at the pool if you can share one, maybe split the cost. Other option is if you go later during the day (4-5pm) a lot of ppl leave their tubes because they dont want to lug it home. 

All in all, we left the property ONCE during our whole weekend here, and it never felt like we were stuck or didnt have enough things to do. M-Life, give me more deals so I can stay here more!",2,0,0

First with the pros:

1) Beach Pool and lazy river, especially if you have kids. 

2) Clean\/nicely appointed rooms and spacious bathrooms.

2 stars well deserved.

Negatives:

1) Long Lines: Check-in and check-out lines were super long.

2) Now Charge for Valet and Self Parking: $18 for valet and $11 for self parking.

3) Terrible Valet Customer Service: 
-Upon attempting to check-in, had to wait 40 minutes behind bumper to bumper traffic until they checked us in. 
-After 11 pm, there was a barrier set where we couldn't enter the valet area and waited a while until the only guy working came and opened the barrier and took the vehicle. 
-Forget calling for your car, we attempted on numerous occasions, but were advised they are too busy and can't help me so I have to physically come down and wait. No wonder, again only observed 1 person working the valet retrieval window in the basement. 

4) Terrible Food Choices: Restaurants and the buffet at the hotel are definitely sub-standard.
After the 1st day, we went to other destinations for a better experience. 

5) No Cocktail Waitresses: My friend and I were playing the corvette slot for over 1.5 hours at max bet, not once did a cocktail waitress approach. We even attempted to go look for one without, but gave up and didn't want to mess up the flow of the game. I think I observed only 1 or 2 working the floor at a time but plenty of girls selling cigarettes, cigars, etc.

6) SUPER Loud Concert at the Beach: The music was so LOUD that my 3 year old could not go to sleep for 3 hours until the music stopped at midnight. Mind you we were on the 11th floor,  sealed windows, but we could perfectly make out the words being sung and the beat being played. Called front desk, they were very apologetic, but come on, you have to take measures before to control the noise or at the very least disclose this to guests traveling with young children and place them in another wing of the hotel.  

7) Check out is at 11: Other hotels it is at 12 and they usually offer extended to 1 or 2. Not here at this great hotel.

I had a family emergency and had to move the date of the stay or loose the reservation all together. The first person we spoke to said we would have to downgrade rooms and pay more, even though it was just moving the reservation a few days. The second person we spoke to a few hours later, understood the situation and went out of her way to make sure we got the same room at the same price, despite the spike in prices from the awards. It was nice that such a huge corporation could be understanding of the ""life happens"" situation. 

Our room was large and clean, but we accidentally  moved some food from the minibar and got charged for it. Be sure to the bill you get emailed when you leave, and just give them a call explaining the situation and they will refund you. 

I was a little irritated there were only 2 hot tubs in the resort area, one of them was really small and the other one was filled with tons of kids. Personally, the lazy river kind of looked like a weird color to me ( I'm guessing from kids who are too lazy to use the bathroom, go figure), BUT the wave pool was clean and so much fun.

In a word, our 2-day stay at Mandalay Bay was disappointing.

My wife and I booked a Deluxe King room for the Thanksgiving Holiday and our rooms - yes, that's plural - had several issues. 

1. Two different rooms were too warm for a good night's sleep. The thermostat is directly under the air vent, so the rest of the room doesn't cool properly. (See the photo I posted...poor design.) We woke up without sheets or blankets both nights. 

2. The plumbing has big problems. If anyone showers or uses the toilet in the rooms around yours, the plumbing in YOUR room gurgles loudly. Amazingly, the staff admitted they know about this problem...and it happened on floors 11 and 12, so the issue seems widespread. 

3. The walls are thin and you can hear activity (talking, coughing, TV, etc) in the rooms next to yours. I expect a lot more from a hotel in this price range.

To their credit, after the first night, the staff quickly agreed to move us to a new room on a different floor. They also gave us a $50 restaurant credit, which was nice, but did not make up for the loss of a night's sleep.

The rooms are large and the bathrooms very nice, but the beds and pillows are average and the other problems overshadow the good things.

Service:
You have to ask if you need something. They'll not offer. It's definitely not a 5 star service but at least they try to fulfill your requests. I found out about the partner program online that they have with Hyatt and Southwest Airlines. So I asked them about it and they said yeah we have that. I provided my numbers to them and they helped me link them to my reservation so I can get points. Had I not google that myself I would've missed out on the chance. Also, nobody told me parking was complimentary for the JCK show. She didn't ask if I drove at all. All these things were not offered. You have to ask and find out yourself. 

Grounds:
Clean and somewhat grand and classy. After all if Four seasons decided to partner with them and share the same hotel grounds, it can't be that bad. The elevators were plenty and fast, separated into different floor sections for efficiency. The signs were pretty clear and you won't get lost as easy as some other casinos. People smoke but it didn't reek like smoke everywhere so it's tolerable. 

Casino:
Standard. As long as you hang out at the table or the slots, you get free drinks flowing  but don't forget to tip. 

Rooms:
Very clean and modern with nice decor and comfortable beds and linens. AC is temperature control so that's a good thing. However, the room has basically nothing because they want you to pay for everything, more on that in my complaint section. 

Eateries:
Although food was expensive here, their portions were big so I got a $20 entree enough for 2 meals. Not bad. 

So why 3 stars?
Because they nickel and dime you, like many Vegas hotels. Going to Las Vegas is all about consumerism, from gambling to night life to food. You have a nice hotel room but they don't want you to stay in there and watch tv. There's a small keurig machine in the room but guess what. You need to pay $5 for a paper cup with cream and sugar packets in it. So no, coffee ain't free. There's no water kettle or refrigerator or microwave in the room. I brought my own travel water kettle. Take that. But to have a microwave you need to pay $40 to rent. And don't you touch that mini bar otherwise you'll be paying $10 for a bag of expired peanuts. It has weight sensor so be careful. 

Outside of the room, if you wanna check out their lame lazy river, which was short and not much going on besides the currents, bring your own tube or buy one from them which costs $22. Also, parking isn't free anymore. It's $12 a day unless you have a parking package or some comps. 

Overall it's an OK stay. Not bad but man they nickel and dime you hardcore. We're joking that one day they're gonna charge for shampoo and towels too and maybe we need start bring everything to Las Vegas....",12,2,1

The bar in the living-room, incredible, the master bathroom mirror WITH a TV in it?.. Incredible, the additional 3 TV's? Perfect!

Therefore we had to leave our luggage with bellcheck (a+for them btw) and brought only the necessities with us when we decided to kill a few hours at one of Mandalays many pools. Unfortunately, we chose the wrong one! Daylight itself was mediocre, the wait to get in was absolutely insane especially for a guest of the hotel. My girlfriend and I waited hours with swimsuits in hand. After over an hour and a half, nearing the front of the line, I was pointed out aggressively and told I had to change into a swimsuit prior to entry (I was 3 people away from entrance with swimsuit in hand).. my girlfriend had to wait while I found the nearest restroom to change.. Upon returning I found she already had entered to the security check in a sundress (not a swimsuit) and was being shook down in front of me at security while I waited in line with general admission. I watched as ""Ken"" with daylight ""privatized"" security was very considerate and thorough In explaining what was and was not allowed inside the day club. To our surprise, Ken politely explained that all physician prescribed medications of ANY TYPE was to be either confiscated and disposed of prior to entry or she would be denied access and would be free to leave with her prescriptions. After a long and hot 2 hour wait..my girlfriend agreed and willingly relinquished her doctor prescribed medications (including antidepressants and anti anxiety medications explicitly prescribed to be taken daily).. Upon the medications being turned over to Ken, the Head of daylight security ""David"" was summoned over to handle and dispose of said medications. David walked up arrogantly, chuckled and said very offensively demeaningly ""what are you?! A walking pill pharmacy girl?!"" ..this attempt at a joke was followed by a dozen or more laughs from the surrounding guests and patrons. My girlfriend was mortified! She immediately turned flush in the face with embarassment but held her composure until we entered the pool area. Once inside she immediately broke down in tears. She had willingly complied with all of Daylights mandated rules.. yet was still 
 put on public display and subjected to cruel and ignorant ridicule and embarrassment from David, the head of Daylight security.  

We have already filed official complaints with Mandalay Bay, as well as Daylights privatized security regarding this matter.  Needless to say we will never return to daylight and am very sad to think that we have lost respect and faith in Mandalay bay and all mgm properties internal management and hiring\/contracting capabilities as more and more resort amenities and services are being poorly outsourced = zero accountability for mgm properties.

They have 5 other pools for all ages, from adult only pools to baby pools.

Careful with their in room fridge though. I took out the drinks from their mini bar to refrigerate my left overs, only to find out that I was charged by their computerised fridge. Had some explaining to do when checking out.

If M-bay was the nicest hotel you've stayed at on the strip, then you would probably think everything I complained about is petty. But if you have stayed anywhere nicer, then you might be able to understand where I'm coming from. Like they say, ignorance is bliss. 

Pros
1. The shampoo\/conditioner had a really nice smell. Reminded me of orange flavored candy. 
2. Key cards came with two free drink vouchers that could be used at pretty much any of the m-bay bars\/lounges. 
3. Express checkout via the television
4. Two couches. Although I didn't get much use out of them, those extra couches would be convenient if you are trying to cram a group of people into that room. 
5. Tram that goes to luxor and excalibur. 
6. Their website gave $89 as their lowest rate but I found a lower rate on another site and they gave me the lower price without any problems. Don't be afraid to call them to ask if you find a lower price elsewhere.

Cons
1. No bath products (as in bubble bath)
2. No bathrobes
3. I had trouble using the keycards. It always took me 4-5x in order to get the door open. 
4. There is no master light. When you enter the room, the first light you can turn on is for the hallway. In order to light up the room, you have to individually turn on all the lamps. 
5. Shallow safe.

This is going to sound like the worst review ever and it actually happened!
Well as of Nov 1 all the pools are closed and beach area one pool is left open and it's not warm really the only reason I stayed here with my friends for SEMA was because I wanted to be by the beach! Lmao.
Anyways j went to take a nap and pulled sheets down to see hair all over the place gross !!  I called front desk they sent someone up changed sheets ok- but later on we found out all the other problems see below!
The hot tub fits about 20 people and it's too crowded to fit 2500 guests !


Ok so we paid a ton of money to stay here so what did we get a room right under construction ! 30th floor !$! Yep we flew 5 hours to be awoken at 6am- ?12pm ! For not one but two days straight ! After I was promised it was stopped !!! I actually couldn't understand why the construction was going on and they put us in a suite ( which we paid for in a spot ) under major construction - I am so pissed still thinking about it - oh they knocked off the resort fee waxing I told them we didn't have to pay - because we were with sema - they don't care 
Also the beds on the old side sucked !!
No one cares here the managers never called me back they are too big to care ! 
Oh to make up for they gave me a a spa day pass wow! 25 dollars !? this place is terrible !
Don't stay here don't say I didn't warn you! 

Best part is I was sick ( from Tender steak house in Mandalay bay) - I only threw up their mushrooms and nothing else ! Needless to say I was sick in bed and housekeeping came in!!! My roommates left the sign on door to leave alone! Ugh what a joke right I told her nicely please leave! She didn't speak English and needed up staying yep! Scared the crap out of me about an hour later I almost died!

So after 2 mornings of waking up and being up- and calling the front desk for 2 Mornings I totally gave up and asked them to please move us 
They did into the new side ! The bathroom tvs were all broken - the tub was dirty! Ugh 
Great right ?
No hot water on the 12th floor! What a joke! 
They came 3 times - not fixed still 
So the last day I wanted to end it nicely I went and took a hot shower to the spa-- I am typing trying to stop stressing over this 
I am telling. You this to save you money time and valuable sleep! 
There is more but I don't want to waste my time anymore with their crap so as I said before don't waste time staying here pick somewhere else !

But somehow that memo seems to have missed the collective e-mail boxes of the Mandalay.  Didn't know they were taking the tropical island theme to the absolute extreme (as in the ""you're on your own"" feeling).  Too bad, as the property itself is very nice indeed.

Specifics?  Well, for one, our humble trip had been in the works for months.  Everything was planned to the second.  I mean this was a military operation we're talking about.  And yet, the best laid plans of mice and men were, well, very rodent like from the beginning.

We had four rooms booked plus a very large Media Suite.  It was made quite clear that we needed a certain DVD player in the Media Suite....hey, I mean why do we even have to ask?  It's a ""Media"" suite for heavens sake....you know, with umpteen large flat panels...I mean flat panels up the wahzoo.  Apparently, ""Media"" does not include a DVD player.  Now all would have been forgiven if not for the fact that it was made quite clear that a DVD player was essential as part of our stay included an audio-video presentation.  I mean, like the whole trip almost revolved around this presentation (which was professionally created with untold man-hours, custom software, love, etc.....shout out to you Roy...well done indeed).  How many times do you need to ask?  After much groaning and moaning, the staff came through...though not without a bunch of blood vessels popping in unison.

And, for the other aspects of the Media Suite, well the iPod interface needs refinement and the wetbar needs work...the whole suite had all of 2 glasses, no essential bar utensils, no wine opener, and a fridge that seemed to want to heat items rather than cool them.  Welcome to Vegas baby!

As for the other non-suite rooms, they were nice enough, but avoid breathing on the minibar items.  Those weight triggered sensors were trigger happy charging your room so much as if you look at a Bud the wrong way.  KA-CHING!  $10 bucks.

All this, of course, is nit picking and dwarfs the main issue, which is we all had a good time hanging out with each other.   For that, I give Mandalay some credit.  The rooms and gambling floor are clean.  The whole hotel is bright and not as smokey as other places along the Strip and the drinks come faster than you can say ""Honey, where's the ATM?""  Oh, and the testosterone level seems a notch below Conan the Barbarian which is very pleasant indeed.

But attention to details matters most when you claim to be a luxury resort on the Strip, and for that, I would have to penalize Mandalay a star or two.  A wholesale review of personnel and operating procedure seems to be in order.  It's a waste to have such a nice property run this way. 

Oh, and that ""what happens in Vegas"" ads?  Yeah right.  This place leaks like a sieve.",4,4,2

When you arrive, the bell hops and valets are very quick to grab your luggage and get you to the lobby to check in!  Super!

Our luggage arrived at our room almost 5 minutes after we arrived.  Super!

The Pools:  FUN!  There are 4 main pools:  1) The Wave Pool, 2) The Lazy River, 3) The general pool, and 4) a smaller pool.  The water is kept very clean, despite everyone's sun tan lotion and suntan oils constantly being put in the pool.  The life guards are young, which means that they aren't fully excited about their jobs.  Most of them just appeared satisfied to be there.

HUGE KUDOS goes out to LIFEGUARD TAMMY!  She is a very experienced lifeguard, who was constantly watching the guests like a hawk!  She made swimming in the pools very safe.  I even saw her helping a couple of handicapped, pregnant, and new mothers find seats in the very crowded pools.  She constantly cleaned up towels that the guests had laying around and left without picking up after themselves.  She was always looking to clean up after guests and to make it a very comfortable and safe place to relax.  Thank you Tammy!

The rooms in the hotel are large, clean, and newly updated.  The beds are comfortable.

I have two minor complaints about my stay:  First, I tried to call the front desk to ask a question and ended up calling twice.  The first time I called, it rang 15-20 times and no one picked up.  The second time I called it rang 15+ times and someone finally picked up the call. 

My other complaint is that I called the Bell Service to help with our luggage at 11:30.  Checkout time is supposed to be 11:00, but we got a late checkout at 12:00.  After three calls to the Bell Service and after tipping one of the bell boys downstairs to lure him to the room to help us with our luggage, we were finally assisted at 12:45.  We waited ONE HOUR and 15 MINUTES for a Bell boy to help us with the luggage.  I realized that it was right after the peak time of checking out, but that was pathetic!

The good:

Nice room! Big tub with separate shower. Beautiful view of the mountains. Windows floor to ceiling.

Quiet. Nuff said. 

Great exfoliating bar soap that is almost regular sized.

Wave pool with sand beach. AWESOME.  

Free tram to Luxor and Excalibur is nice.

Good room service. Actually too good. They kept bothering us and opening our door and knocking with our do not disturb sign up. 

Easy checkout. TV, phone, email, lobby. You choose. 


The bad:
Pool hours are 8am to 8pm. What?? You're a ""bay.""  How can the pool ever close? Minus a star.

Lazy River is full of pee and booze. Gross. 

Mini fridge isn't accessible for your own food. 

Its a ways from the strip and so you feel compelled to get food at 'overly priced for the quality' restaurants. 

Expect to wait in line for at least an hour for check-in. Nuts. 

No fan in poo room. 

Overall, the good outweighs the bad. I'll give her 4 stars although I agree with Yelp that it is 3.5 stars. Ill round up for good measure..... I'm not sure I would stay here again...I really like accessible pools and mini fridges.",7,3,8

Staff was friendly and helpful, room was clean, comfy and nicely appointed. Beach and pool were great. Cardio Center was basic and a little crowded, but clean and nice.

The room and bathroom were both spacious, comfortable, and clean. I didn't hear any of my neighbors so that was good. However, on my first night there, the showers did not run hot.

It's expensive, but that's to be expected when it's on the strip. What's good about Mandalay Bay is that it's on the end of the strip so it's not that close to City Center. I'm also okay with it not having the best restaurants or buffet because it's not as packed with tourists walking through it, unlike the Bellagio and Caesar's Palace. With that said, it is a long walk to get to that area, but there are trams that you can take. I didn't have time, but Cirque du Soleil's Michael Jackson One is held here. There is also an aquarium.

Self Parking: $12 per day with in\/out privileges here and other Las Vegas MGM hotels (MGM Grand, Bellagio, Aria, Circus Circus, etc.). I hate that the self-parking garage is located on the opposite side of the casino, far away from the guest rooms.

Pools and amenities: There are two pools. There is the Mandalay Bay Beach with a wave pool, but it was closed for the season. Then there is the trendy Moorea Beach Club with several small pools. It could be relaxing, but way too many kids there. I wish they had an indoor pool with longer hours because both pools close at 5pm. If you want to take a dip, there are whirlpools at the spa, but that cost $30 per day, as if this hotel doesn't nickel and dime you already. ALSO, don't touch the snacks in your room! It's expensive! Don't even make coffee! Go to the nearest grocery store to pick up snacks instead.

Check-in: I see that they have mobile check-in\/check-out, but neither worked when I was there. I stayed during Thanksgiving weekend so check-in took stupidly long.

M Life: Don't forget to sign up for M Life. Even though Sapphire tier doesn't give you any perks and it'll take you forever to reach the next level, you might as well collect all the points you can in case you do stay with a MGM hotel again in the future.",5,2,4

Was married in the shark reef and had a wonderful wedding. It was worth the price I paid. Our photos came out wonderful and the photographer and wedding planner where excellent. 
Now I'm going to go into why I believe this resorts deserves the negative stars. The hotel layout was horrible. The hotel rooms had weird layouts and decor. The casino was small and the slot machines with wound so tight that you couldn't ever win. There were dirty glasses left in the bridal suit from the wedding the day before And my wedding was at 9am.  The photograph company reminded me of a used car sales lot. $3500 for a digital copy of all the photos taken. Really??? Do people pay that? It's Vegas it's suppose to be cheaper then a wedding at home. 
The last and most important thing I have to say about the  resort is the way they run business when it come to accounting. I booked 4 rooms. One of which was included in my wedding package for 1 night. 2 of the rooms were for 1 night and the suit that was included in my package I added a second night. The 4th room was for 2 nights. I gave the receptionist my credit card for all 4 rooms and did my thing. I checked out of all the rooms and showed $ 0 due on my bills. Then I get a debt collection letter 1 year later stating I didn't pay for one of the rooms and they had tried to contact me. I never received anything from the hotel. No email no phone call no letter in the mail. Nothing! They never billed my card for the amount due when I checked out. They made a mistake and if I would have know this I would have paid don't get me wrong. I have to let everyone know that this resort had a poor business practice of collecting payments. I will never due business with them again and I strongly recommend that others do the same.",3,0,0

Pisses me off that now they charge $18 per night for valet and $8 or $9 for self parking. Free parking has been a perk for Vegas FOREVER, and in addition to raising rates, charging a high daily resort fee (somewhere around $35\/night) and ripping people off for sub par food...because none of the restaurants in MB justify the price, they have to go and ruin a good thing for people and start charging for parking. 

To add insult to injury, we took the car out for dinner and waited over 30 minutes for the car to be retrieved and we were THE ONLY DAMN PEOPLE WAITING IN THE VALET LINE!!!

Limo driver was late and no ""Happy birthday Cyndi"" sign as requested!  My daughter checked into her room and no champagne or balloons were in her room as promised!  I paid extra for all of this!  It took four calls and a day late to finally get the champagne and balloons delivered to her room!

The manager agreed and said they have had issues with those rooms!  Why are they putting people in these rooms if they know they will not be able to sleep???    No discount was offered, just the refund of the upgrade fee.  

We booked the Cabana and informed the guy of our discount.  When reviewing our bill the discount of $150 on the cabana was not applied until I had to call and speak with the manager, again! Apparently no one knew about the Internet special.  However, when pushed about it they found my booking info and applied the discount.   Why does everything have to be so difficult? 

On the day of the show, they could not find my reservation!  Even with the reservation number I had, they still couldn't find it.  I booked the show through the Mandalay Bay!!

But this time I wanted to leave after the second night. The rooms are okay but every where you go on the property, you feel like you are being pinched for fees. Valet parking is now $20 a night. Self parking is $12 a night. Coffee at the cheapest stand is $5 and a coffee drink can cost $14. The chips and treats at the shop run $5 to $25 for things that cost $1 to $10 at any store. Dinner at restaurants can easily run over $75 a plate because they cleverly exclude things from each menu selection. And the staff has been pared down to a minimum. You can wait 5 min to leave your care with valet even though you are the only one in line.  It boggles the mind how this corporation became so arrogant. The customer is simply a sheep to by shorn, not a guest worth serving. 

My room including resort fee and valet parking cost $250 a night. The only good thing I can say is that I won more at the tables than I spent at the hotel this weekend. But that is not thanks to the hotel.

The pool\/s are nice and almost a necessity in this heat. The foundation room at the top had a neat vibe and music choice one day, and the next day was dead. I guess it must have been the difference between weekend vs. weekday.

Got a free sky view suite on their 62nd floor.  I had a nice super close view of the Mandalay Bay sign, but the view of the ""city"" was crappy.  And by ""city"" I mean a bunch of desserted streets and parking lots, blech!  There are specific elevators that take you to the top floors, and you need to slide your room key in the elevator slot to take you up there.  

I was so totally lost and didn't know where these elevators were, so I had to ask the cashier at the snack stand. Without hesitation, she left the register and walked us all the way over to the elevators.  Totally awesome!

The description on their site and the virtual tour does not do this suite justice.  This suite really is like 3 rooms in one. The extended living room has it's own sitting area, plasma, mini bar, and a bathroom.  When you go to the bedroom, you have a mini sitting area by the window and side-by-side closets on the other side.  

The bathroom was another world in itself.  Marble floors and surfaces.  We had a bunch of bath salts and I drew a nice hot bath with the salts mixed in while watching TV directly across.  Sooo nice and relaxing.  The only thing that sucked was the remote wasn't working so I was stuck watching one channel, unless I wanted to get my butt out of the nice hot water to change it.  Shower was super nice.

The cleaning service is one of the best I've dealt with.  The little old ladies were so nice and sweet.  They came in to clean up but we asked them not to bother with that for the whole weekend.  I think this made them super happy, because they hooked us up with a bunch of shampoos, soaps, bath salts, etc.  I gave them a nice tip and sent them on their merry way.  I saw them a few more times throughout the weekend and we always waved hi to eachother.

Bath robes and slippers were amazingly comfortable.  I even took my slippers home! :X

LOVE this hotel.  Their brunch buffet is THE best too.  Their valet are cool cats in my book.  Always took the time to ask us how our day is going.  The wait is never too long.

The only caveat is that their hotel is all the way at the end of the fricking strip and it's on the totally wrong end!  The hot spot is all the way on the other side, where Wynn and Venetian are at.  I think they need to get rid of some of their venues and get some newer, hotter clubs in there!",1,0,1

My dad and step-mom brought us to Vegas to stay for a whole week, where they got married on 4\/16. Our rooms (3 of them) were nice and we did not have any issues. One of the head managers sent some sparkling wine for my parents after we checked in, hand delivered by room service, which was nice!

As we stayed a whole week, you can imagine we spent quite some time here. Eating, swimming, sleeping and gambling were all accomplished. If you're interested in what I ate here please see my other reviews.

The beds were comfy and the bathrooms were neat. The only thing I would improve there would be adding an exhaust fan to the toilet area... The TVs are nice and the menus did not make me want to throw the remote through the screen like they do at other hotels I've stayed in.

The elevators are fast and smooth, the design of splitting the levels into thirds and having 3 elevator banks is ingenious. 

†*note* Out of ALL the casinos in Vegas I visited, Mandalay Bay was the only one to have a large variety of craft brews available, COMPLIMENTARY for gamblers. From memory, I had the following: Lagunitas IPA, New Belgium Fat Tire, Firestone Walker PIVO and Pale 31, Brooklyn Brown Ale, and a few others plus premium imports like Stella Artois and Hoegaarden. 



As for the gambling, my party did the following

Roulette - one of our guys had good luck for a while, but it's roulette... Not much to say other than all I saw were 00 wheels.

Big Six Wheel - my brother played for a bit, the second spinner\/dealer wasn't giving the wheel full spins but he left the table dead even so it wasn't a loss.

Video Poker - my personal primary mode of gaming here, and overall I was up about $100 all week so I had great luck playing Jacks or Better, Bonus DB and DDB. There are some decent payouts for 25c modes, with a few machines having better pay tables. If you are playing $1 you can find good payouts on most machines.

Blackjack - $10-15 tables minimum at most times. Good dealers who are helpful to newbies.

Poker Room - a few in my group played the $45 10am Hold'em tournament. It was fun! I wish I had seen they had them earlier in the week, I probably would have played another. 

Slots - not much to say, a lot of new and different machines.


The beach and lazy river were interesting, but there is hardly any shade to be found. There are some real beauties working at the Bikini Bar! ;)

After being up and down the strip all week, I always enjoyed coming ""home"" to MB. Their ""signature scent"" as I call it was also my favorite of all the casinos. The access to the tram was a huge bonus too. 

After seeing so many awesome properties run by MGM GRAND, I'm pumped that they're building a new casino in MD near where I work. I'm sure it will be very nice!",0,0,1

A Vegas Resort review is intimidating.  Not only are there so many options, but incredibly varying expectations.  But here goes...

WHY YOU SHOULD TRY THIS RESORT:

-Can you say updated rooms, spacious, well appointed?  The bathroom is an added bonus with double sinks, roomy marble shower and separate sunken tub.  Hint - stop by one of the Basin Shops (Planet Hollywood or Venetian) for some luxurious bath bombs http:\/\/basin.com\/stores 

-The Hotel as a ""Grand"" feel with high ceilings and tropical decor.  There are various lobby bars that have free music of different genres each night.

-The Shops at Mandalay is a great option for shopping and dining! A bonus during high or low temperatures to enjoy a break from the outdoors. Various restaurants are all good and shops are diverse. This place FEELS like a resort should. 

-A tram connects to Luxor and Excalibur...FANTASTIC!  It's like having all 3 options within reach. And if you've been to Las Vegas, you know that a Vegas block is like the size of 2 regular blocks. 

-Pools\/Beach are amazing. Huge, something for everyone. 

-The service is by far the BEST of all the Strip hotels I've stayed in (pretty much all the main ones!)  

-Take the time to research their website thoroughly. It's user friendly and you will discover a lot more (spas, nightclubs, shows, etc...)

SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND:

You will be at one end of the Strip...so plan accordingly. If you like to walk, you can. Otherwise, budget for taxis if you want to visit the other end if the strip. But honestly, there's so much to do being centered at this resort that you don't even need to go much farther out unless you want to.

I came to Mandalay Bay for my 21st birthday, my first time in Vegas. I had heard Mandalay Bay was super nice, glitzy, glamorous. It was definitely aesthetically pleasing. However, it is at the VERY end of the strip. You can't even get on the tram to directly take you to the center of all the action. Had I would've known this, I wouldn't have stayed there.

The employees seem to be pretty scatterbrained. When we walked to check in, the attendant just walked away as soon as we got to the front. She didn't return for about 5 minutes. But this part really takes the cake...

We get to our room and there is some food trash on the floor from the previous person who stayed there. We called guest services the next day and they agreed (after some arguing) that we would get a $50 food credit and room service would come to the room again that day. We got back that night and they did not come.

The next day, during normal room service time, they cleaned the room and left the trash. I didn't feel like calling them again, so we left it.

Day 3, final full day, they cleaned the room as normal and left the trash AGAIN. After we told them THREE times. Why would they clean the entire room, pick up OUR own trash, but not this leftover trash?! Ridiculous.

The tap water tastes like pool water... So be prepared to drop $8 per Fiji water. Don't pick up any food items in the room, because even if you pick them up to look at it, they will charge you.

We called prior to checking in to ask about if they had a coffee pot in the room. We were told they had a Keurig. We got to the room and they charge $4 per K-Cup. Save yourself the trouble and walk down the street to Walgreens and buy some.

We went to the pool and you can't even rent rafts. You have to buy one and the smallest one (fit for a 5 year old) is $25. You get to keep it at the end... But who wants to keep a raft?

All in all, I'm not happy with my stay here. If you're going to Vegas, you might as well just spend the same price and stay at Caesars, Paris, or the Wynn. Everything is overpriced and no one there actually cares about the wellbeing of the customers.",12,9,5

The pros:  BETTER DAMN ROOM
The cons: at the end of the STRIP

The compromise?  The shuttle from Mandalay to the Exacalibur (via Luxor), puts you back into the heart of the strip where the countdown and the fiasco goes on at midnight.

I really had no idea that a place could be somewhat affordable and still be well worth the money. We had a two bedroom suite and the view was breathtaking. I loved going to bed at night and seeing this huge lit up pyramid outside of my window. Then waking up and seeing all of las vegas. Its at one of the ends of the strip and I guess the only downside would be travel but they make that easy for you too. There is a Tram that takes you from the hotel to excalibur free of charge. Of course there is also the option of taking a taxi to anywhere on the strip costing you from $10-$20 (any more and you are being scammed) make sure the meter in the taxi is starting at $3.50. If not, get another taxi driver. Another good point about this hotel is that is one of the closest to the airport. If you don't want to stay in a motel 6 but want to be close enough to not miss your flight, this hotel is your best bet. 

The casino: 
This place is huge but not in the gigantic sense to where it takes you forever to get anywhere. It is also connected to the Luxor and Delano. There should be some shops that are around the casino so if you forgot anything such as toiletries, this is your best bet. Near the elevators in the lobby there is a connivence store but its pricey there. The downside to the casino area is the food. Its really nothing to write home about and place for the love of all that is good stay the hell away from the bayside buffet. I went there for breakfast and regretted every bite of it.

Pool area:
It basically looks like a beach. Please make your way here even if you are just out for a walk just take a look at this place. There is a hot tub somewhere but I find that a little weird with strangers. There is a lazy river here that is probably meant for shorter people. I say this because I am 6' and the depth of  the pool is half my size. If you want to float on your back the whole time, great. If you want to walk around in the river prepare to have your legs scraped by the pools lining. Finally, the wave pool. Really cool concept but there is only one wave per like 5 mins. I know they live in the dessert and don't understand the concept of bodies of water but come on. Also they have a small section for you to swim in. Still a cool pool in my opinion just wished it was better.

Special notes: 
-Aquarium is around $17
-Border Grill - not so great (avoid the unlimited brunch special)
- Take the Tram first then take a taxi if needed. All the trains are runned by computers and show up every six minutes or less.",7,1,1

It was so spacey. I was initially concerned that we would hear the neighbors above or next to us, but that really wasn't the case.

 First, when I checked in I found out that they didn't have the room I reserved available - a king bed and a strip view were part of my girlfriend's birthday present, as she had never been to Vegas and I wanted to show her the town from what I thought would be a perfect hotel.  I thought that reserving a room like that over the phone (and even paying for a night up front!) would get me the room I needed but no, there is no way to be sure that you're getting what you want or pay for at this place.
 The check-in procedure took AN HOUR thanks to an incompetent chump and sassy desk manager (she started giving me attitude like it was my fault they didn't have my room available!  wtf?) while my girlfriend sat out in the car, surrounded by drunks, in their driveway.  If that wasn't bad enough, this front desk hassle made us too late for my special birthday dinner!  Where I had a hook-up!  This was the first night in Vegas and already Mandalay Bay was losing me time and money!
 That night, I tried to put our expensive leftovers into a fridge but discovered that the only mini-fridge in the room was full of beverages that you couldn't move or else the computerized weight system would charge you immediately.  So, no fridge!  Even Super 8 has a mini-fridge!  We went to bed that night enraged.
 The next night we ordered $22 nachos from room service (there was a $5 ""cover charge"" ... just another cutthroat fee at this place).  I didn't get the room service guy's name because I was too busy staring at - seriously - LESIONS on his face, neck, and even wrist!  It wasn't acne, it was some kind of exczema or something.  I've never not eaten nachos before in my life, that night was a total waste of food and money.  Why hire room service guys who destroy your appetite!?  Isn't that a health code violation too?
 Finally, I was looking forward to talking to the front desk as I checked out.  The clerk asked the people in front of me ""did you enjoy your stay with us?"" so I figured that would be my opportunity to let Mandalay Bay know that it was really not an accomodating place to stay.  However, the front desk clerk just checked me out without even talking and moved right on to the next in line with cold dead eyes.  I should have stayed and asked for a manager but I was honestly too tired and frustrated to fight.  
 ""Disappointed"" cannot even begin to describe our stay at Mandalay Bay.  I had hoped to take my birthday party there this summer for their awesome pools but there's no way I'm going to put up with their incompetent, scuzzy staff, poor reservation schedule, and counterproductive accomodations.

I got settled and was more than pleased with the accommodations, only downside I saw to staying here was it was more or less at the end of the strip...this can make for a challenge navigating back to the hotel room intoxicated.  Anywho...

Casino was like any other for the most part, but it was nice to see that the pit bosses actually paid attention (sucks when you are betting big hands and they don't notice...think comps later).

I pretty much ate at Red, White & Blue the entire time (Deli\/Burger type place)...cheap and fast and the bartenders (I ate at the bar) were all really cool.

I went to the Aquarium to look at the sharks and other creatures & figured what the hell...so I ponied up some $ and went diving in the 1.3 million gallon Shark Aquarium...not cheap ($650), but a pretty cool experience!

The tram takes you from Mandalay Bay to the Luxor, then on to the Excalibur...so it's easy enough to get everywhere on the strip passing through hotels...just be sure to keep track of time, because if it gets too late...you'll be trekking it and if your sobriety is in question...it's a long walk!

The beach area is pretty nice and the lazy river is great to unwind in, but BRING YOUR OWN TUBE, they charged some ridiculous amount of money for one!  The wave pool is decent, but the lifeguards won't let you lay down in the shallow water which is kind of lame.  Bring sandles less you want your feet to melt off....it is Nevada!

The bell hops, at least the ones I encountered are pushy for tips...I'm a generous guy...but the second you pull that crap on me, you sunk your own ship.

So, we arrive to the beautiful Mandalay Bay Hotel Lobby. There are many lines with about 5-6 people in each, so my cousin and I split up to try and get the fastest line. We switch two times because we were fooled into thinking each customer that was next would be faster; not the case. We were probably waiting for 25 minutes until they opened another line. 

The lady at the desk was apologetic for our wait. I inquired about the cost of adding another person and she said $30., but I'll waive it. I thought, ok, that was nice, definitely showing off their 4 star customer service side. Makes me not so upset about waiting. 

The next morning, we woke up kinda late due to some heavy partying the night before (of course, right?). It was about 10:30am and we still weren't ready to check out by 11am. I decided to call the front desk and ask about late check out. This time, another lady said she would give us a complimentary check out time at 12pm. Sweeeeet! 

Aside from our room being comfy and neat, it was clean and spa like. I especially enjoyed showering while standing on cemented rocks; gives me that outdoor feeling without really being outdoors and I loved the little niche for shampoo and stuff. Love, love, love the dual vanity sinks; really helpful with three people in one room. Oh and the TV in the bathroom...yeah, you get my drift. It's all about their bathroom.

This no longer is the case.  With so many newer Resorts that have popped up since its opening in 1999, Mandalay Bay can't hold a candle to the other upscale ""it"" properties.  Today, its main clientele generally consists of a steady stream of conventioners, families with older children (teenagers), and young adult Vegas newbies that have no idea where the hot spots on the Strip are, and as a result,  unknowingly book a stay here.

Those looking for an upscale, high-energy, hip, young and sexy location on the strip, you'd be on the complete opposite side staying at Mandalay Bay.  Party kids with money to spend, or people looking for the latest strip excitement need to book into the ""5-Diamond Row"" --- four of only five 5-Diamond Award Winning resorts on the Strip and they're all lined up right next to each other at the northern mid-strip --- The Venetian, Wynn, Encore, and The Palazzo.  Collectively, these four resorts are home to Sin City's most sought after nightlife venues: Tryst, Surrender, XS, LAVO, and TAO.

Mandalay Bay? You've got not much in terms of nightlife.  Or shopping.  Or anything remotely exciting within a half mile radius (the low-budget casino-resorts Luxor, Tropicana and Excalibur are Mandalay Bay's immediate neighbors.)

As you already probably deduced from above, I dislike staying here because of its location. Even though it's located ON the Las Vegas Strip, it's built on the VERY FAR southern end of it (Mandalay Bay is actually the very first hotel that ""starts"" the Las Vegas Strip when approaching Sin City via Interstate 15 North, or coming from McCarran Int'l Airport), which makes it a bit inconvenient if you're looking to property-hop or taking a cab to a nightclub at a hotel farther up the strip.

That aside, Mandalay Bay EASILY has the best AND largest pool area of any Resort in Las Vegas.  Bar none.  Mandalay Bay beach actually has sand --- intended to replicate the Southeast Asian ""seaside resort"" motif, and it features multiple pools, a lazy river, VIP cabana areas, a separate ""on-the-beach"" casino, and an artificial wave pool.

The hotel's basic rooms are a pinch above the standard fare. Nothing over-the-top or amazing, but they're nice.  The bathrooms give it a rating boost as they house a soaking tub and separate walk-in shower.

I'm not a fan of the casino. Although it has high ceilings and chandeliers (and was probably once considered a luxurious casino), it has an incredibly dated and cavernous feel to it. Kind of like if The Mirage casino took some steroids, O.D.'d and threw up all over itself.

Their Shark Reef Aquarium on Resort grounds is a great major attraction that everyone should at least visit once. I have a separate review for that.

The hotel is beautiful the rooms are beautiful and we have experienced overall great service. The reason I rated our experience as a three star is simple because of the cold showers! The first night we had an amazing hot shower; life was good. The next morning it was a barley lukewarm. We assumed that everyone else in the building was also showering so we wrote it off as a fluke. The next day, after many hours of walking the strip and spending a considerable amount of time in the smoke fill casinos, all we wanted was a hot shower. We turned it on and waited... and waited... and waited. It never got past a threshold that would allow us to plunge our tired bodies into the cold water. It was 1:00am and we really didn't want to go to bed smelling like an ashtray so we called the desk to see what they could do. I have to give credit when credit is due, the front desk sent an engineering technician to our room (1:00 in the morning) and was able to fix the issue and give us the long desired hot water (thank the lord). I wish that was the end of the story but as I'm sure you can guess, the next morning was shower was not as invigorating... The water was hot for about 4 minutes then quickly got cooler and cooler.

Second day, we asked room service to come later they even provided a time good for them to come. We agreed to their time. Third day, we asked room service to come another time, and they agreed. On our last day I asked the front office if we could check out later due to our late night out at EDC. Front desk said no to a late check out. I began to argue with the guy stating that we never even got room service so why should that rule apply to us. He then agreed to a late check out.

I HAD to get some sleep so I moved to a different hotel more in the center of things. People have been kind not to brand Mandalay Bay about the ominous situation and oddly it WAS the fire alarm that cut things WAY short for one Guest!!! The staff works VERY HARD to keep their jobs so please consider them and lay offs when you consider writing something cruel. They have been through a lot last week. THANK YOU MANDALAY BAY!!! Your Fire Alarms worked GREAT when needed!!!  XOXOXO

THANK YOU OTHER GUESTS!!! Please do not give that freak credit it could have been anywhere. I stayed at ALL the big hotels that week and NOT ONE elevator security checked what we were bringing up to our rooms. I am SURE this will change at ALL MGM and Caesars Group will change that waive by policy with odd luggage and no one will mind. Example I saw a lot of golf club looking bags going on up and elevator security just waived them on by at OTHER hotels. I do not know that about this one. I was very focused on food expo.

The pool is gorgeous and I WILL return if I am not doing much on the strip and want to relax just in this beautiful environment. They have the BEST POOL on the strip!!! Most newer hotels are near each other and this is a real hike from most MGM resorts. My friends keys did not work 1\/3 the time and he had no eel skin wallet or magnets, So they need to work on very minor issues.

Mandalay Bay is a gorgeous property just needs some updating, like alarm batteries, more courteous luggage handlers, staff that SMILES MORE and really appreciates our business. not looks worn out and not happy to be there. Here I will mention Mirage-EVERYONE thanked us for almost every step we took! I was floored! Even if we tossed something in the garbage they thanked us! Food was also excellent at Mirage as it is at Mandalay Bay.. 

They do offer excellent entertainment at Mandalay Bay so I will return when I do not care to wander the strip.

So I have been going to LV my WHOLE life (being from CA & family lives there). I've been to a lot of casinos! People are walking around in bathing suits and it's very casual, my kind of place! There is a young people's day beach dance MTV type club that looked just like my kind of place if I were their age. For us though there were several different places with live bands (80's, 70's, Sinatra style & DJ hip hop\/R&B). When I walked into Mandalay Bay I thought it smelled like heaven. They pump gardenia fragrance throughout the hotel. It is open & airy beautiful, even the casino was not stuffy and there is even wind when walking through one part of it. But the beach! Yes, there is a beach in Las Vegas! To be at the beach and have drink service was so fun. I didn't think I'd win at the casino being a large, expensive place (I always think I would do better downtown at a small casino) but I did win! They have penny slots, my fave! I won $35 and 60 in blackjack. I was thrilled! I know, I know, not a lot but for me, who only took 100 to gamble with? It was fun! There were people for good service everywhere I went, I didn't have to wait. Even the off to the side little sandwich counter, the little place by the horse gambling I think, made our sandwiches to order (my friend is vegan). The whole experience was just sheer fun fun fun. It was a vacay close but felt far away from home. I forgot about my life for two glorious days. We paid full price but I thought worth every dime so can't wait to go back with discounted prices!

Omg! Don't expect anything in terms of service or anything above the basics... Yes, the rooms are very nice. 
that is the big bonus. We were traveling with our 18 month old (to visit friends, not gamble\/play) and the big hotel room was a good fit. The space was large enough for him to explore but not filled with dangerous obstacles.

check-in: what the hell is going on here??? No sense of order... There were 4 ""double sets"" of line open, and I couldn't figure out if there was one line or if I'm just taking my chances to see which line would be fastest... Either way the simple process of hecking in took 30 minutes on a thursday, for god's sake.... And seriously?? Have you considered just putting in a SELF CHECK-IN kiosk and save yourself a few salaries?? It doesn't take a brain surgeon to look up a reservation and spit out keys. 

for someone like myself who was not going to be looking for an upgrade (i'm not a big haggler by nature, we weren't gambling, and I just wanted to get our toddler upstairs and into his jammies!!) 

so, we finally get keys and head upstairs. The maze of these big resorts never ceases to amaze me. If I can't make heads or tails of how to get somewhere when I am completely lucid, I don't see how anyone remoty drunk will find themselves out of these places safely. 
the bathtub??? A few loose hairs from the nether regions of some blonde person were still in the bathtub!!! WTF. This, I expect from a motel six or even a crappy days inn, but please. I was so grossed out but so drained from our trip that I just wiped them away, ran the hot water like hell in the tub. There are sometimes not enough words to explain my horror. (we were on the 8th floor on may 13 and 14.... like I said, a basic room (we didn't need or want a suite).

the line for the (free) valet was insanely long. hm.... if I can self park and get into the building faster than if I valet parked the car.... self park was easier for us. 

self parking lot: very hot and muggy and no ventilation. I can't imagine what it must be like when it's 104F outside??? the horror! 

overall, the staff there know that this place has made a name for itself so they've stopped trying.

going back to my original analogy, it's kind of like that relationship in college where your sweetie used to do so many little things for you.... pick you up at the airport.... flowers ""just because""..... throw six month ""anniversary"" celebrations.....
and then, at some point... IT ALL STOPS! (

that's what mandalay bay is. She used to make you dinner before you came home, put on lacy lingerie on a monday night, picked up your dry cleaning and got your mom a mother's day card for you to send to your own mom.

Typical Vegas, they are ""nice"" as long as the money is coming in - when it goes out, nice makes way for policy and making money. 

The rooms are clean and really quiet from both neighbor and hallway noise. It's Vegas so there are those who come and go all day and all night. Pillows are the over stuffed variety. Neck was a little stiff in the AM. 

The only real frustration is at the bell desk and their luggage management.  Drop off in the lobby bell desk but the pickup requires a maze-to-find-the-cheese obstacle course down, right, right again, out the doors, out the other doors, right again then to the right of the taxi line. I think they should tip me for finding the cheese.",0,1,1

But I feel that other Vegas travelers need to know of my experience. My husband planned a girls trip for my 40th b-day. A beautiful surprise that I was really looking forward to.  He booked us a suite for (what I consider to be) a very high price. This price could and would have been warranted if the quality and service were great, or even good, but sadly we had a bump in the road at every turn. Check in was not on time and we were given the run around about when our room would even be ready. We had nowhere to change to go to the pool and spent 2 hours trying to change in the spa and find our bags. The spa tried to charge us $25.00 a head to change in their facility even though the front desk sent us there. We also spent a great deal of time looking for our bags, which ended up outside with the valet. The front desk tried to be accommodating, but i don't believe it was enough. Our stay was already tainted, and for a quick 48 our trip our first day was shot.   Once we finally did get into the room, it smelled of feet. Like... smack you in the face foot odor. We called housekeeping several times and they tried their best to mask it with a spray. The doors in bathrooms did not close and some lights in bedrooms did not work.  Ordinarily, i could look over these things but not at 799.00 a night. 

I would definitely look at other options for your stay in Vegas.",0,0,0

Had the pleasure of staying here with three lovely ladies. One who I was dating at the time. I normally stay at THEhotel. And our group had actually booked a room to stay there as well. But upon check in, someone screwed up the room reservation. I really didn't care. It wasnt the resorts fault.

Rooms are clean, bathroom is roomy. Sheets and bed are ok. Service was attentive when it came time to clean the rooms. I yet to check out their pool and go swimming. Which I always regret. But their spa is pretty bad ass. Grabbed lunch at the hussons cantina. Pretty good food. It's Mexican food FYI. Casino is average. I did however win 800$ on the slots. Which is always a plus. 

So in the end, it's a slightly above average hotel and casino. I also forgot to mention their tram can take you to either Luxor next door. Or Excalibur passing that. Which is great if it's a 100 degrees plus outside. Look for online discounts though. Try not to pay full price. Those discounts are always floating around on line.",4,1,2

The room was very comfortable, especially the bed and size of the bathroom.  Nice stand alone shower.  The only restaurant I ate at was the House of Blues.  And a tea at Starbucks.  For me, this hotel didn't work as well as something on the other end of the strip would have.  I didn't have any interest in the Luxor or Excalibur which are linked.  The parking garage is in the back of the hotel, as far from the room elevators as possible so every day was a long walk thru the busy casino for that purpose.  Not a big deal, but other hotels are layed out with easier access.  The parking garage was a beast. Especially Friday and Saturday nights with the events at the hotel (concert at the pool, night clubs).  Speaking of night clubs, there is a club just inside the doors from the parking garage and it was INSANE to walk thru this area Friday and Saturday nights.  I couldn't imagine trying to maneuver that with kids (which is another whole issue - why are there so many kids and families making Las Vegas the new Disney vacation?).  There was always a wait at the elevators, very crowded.  

The Mandalay Beach and Pool were beautiful but crowded.  At the wave pool and lazy river, the lounge chairs actually sit in sand giving you the beach feeling, but wow the lounge chairs are close together side to side, top to bottom.  The wave pool and lazy river were full of kids, the swimming pools full of young adults.  Probably better early in the morning with the young adults are still in bed recovering.

Facts: 
- Vegas lures you in with its surface cheapness and then charges for everything--resort tax, parking, $3 credit card charge in taxis, etc. That's just the reality. We expected it and dealt with it.
- Vegas is hot in summer. Like, slap you in the face then smother you hot. I spent my childhood in SoCal and the south, so you'd think I'd be prepared, but I've spent the last five years in Seattle, and I wasn't. Oh boy, I was not prepared.
- Vegas water is harder than a teenage boy on prom night and tastes like an unwashed armpit. I generally don't buy bottled water (again, Seattleite), but I ended up buying it regularly here because I found the tap water utterly unpalatable. #firstworldproblems
- Every casino, and therefore the main floor of every hotel, reeks of smoke. I'd forgotten smoking was allowed in casinos. Asthma sufferers, carry your inhaler. I learned this the hard way.

These aren't warnings, but more like ""be aware before you go"" statements. They're unavoidable and part of the experience. 

Now, on to Mandalay Bay specifically. As a disclaimer, my partner and I aren't gamblers or drinkers, so our experience is limited to the resort parts of the hotel.

We chose this resort because I'd read it was queer friendly and because it looked nice. It was very nice. The bed was maybe the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in, and I'm super picky about beds. The bathroom was generously sized, and there was a tub, which is nigh a requirement for both of us. One weird complaint I have about the TV is that it seemed to have the same shows running on a loop (???).

Hotels in Vegas, and this one in particular, have every detail down to a science for making guests comfortable. I'm used to air conditioning in summer being sub-arctic to compensate, but even in the MASSIVE open spaces, the level of air conditioning was just right. The sound control in non-casino parts of the hotel was also pretty incredible. The hallways, room, and restaurant areas were extremely quiet. Even the signage for navigating said massive spaces is excellent.

The service is also great. Staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to help. If they silently resent your stupid questions, they don't show it. We were lucky enough to arrive after the rush of 2200 conference attendees, so we didn't have to wait to check in, but the front desk person had to do a little work to find us a non-ADA room (we wanted to leave those for wheelchair users). She graciously accommodated our request for a room away from the elevators.

My only #firstworldproblems real complaint is the wifi. I get that in such a large space, keeping a good wifi signal is hard, but the signal sucked about 30% of the time, and you have to authenticate your connection through your browser. Every evening, I kept having to do acrobatics to re-authenticate. Mildly annoying. Having such a mammoth wifi network also meant Pokemon Go couldn't figure out where I was at any given moment (waaahhh).

But these are really small complaints, and overall, we've enjoyed our stay a lot. I don't know that I'll be back, but that's simply because I need a non-smoking establishment that won't tempt my asthmatic lungs into rebellion every time I go downstairs. It has nothing to do with the quality of the actual hotel.",1,2,1

a) We were greeted with a 20 min wait for single lane valet parking - terrible design and you are stuck waiting, 
b) Our hotel reservations were specifically for a king.  I was offered an upgrade at $100\/nt more for a room that is king only according to the picture.  So I go to my room and find out we were given a 2-queen room.  Not happy.  Then after returning down to front desk they give me a ""so sorry the king option is not guaranteed go complain to the online source you ordered through.""  They were quite rude and shockingly zero apologies (admittedly I wasn't in the friendliest of moods.)  Also the ""complain to where you made your reservation"" was lame because AAA.com is who I went through and they do not charge me - only the hotel does.  
c) The bedroom carpet appeared a bit dirty\/worn - time for a refresh if they are going to charge $250\/nt.
d) TV has the worst user-friendly menu I can recall experiencing - not sure who made that decision but it's those little things that make your stay nice, 
e) most of the time there were few open gambling tables (several empty if they had dealers working but it was the holidays - I think they just don't employ enough dealers), 
f) poor signage to find things in the hotel. 

On the plus side they did have a good variety of restaurants.  My wife and I went to Border Grill and Fleur - and they were both excellent. The breakfast restaurant we went to had excellent food but I cannot remember the name - Citizens maybe?

Overall my opinion is this place is that it is ""very half-assed"". It has the feel of a burnt out manager whose lack of attention to detail results in a staff and operation heading towards a ""Monte Carlo"" down the street caliber of stay.  I love the MGM so this surprises me to see, and I visit Vegas 6-8x per year but if I'm going to drop $500 for a 2-night stay (+500 in restaurants and $2500 gambling) I expect much better.

My husband and I have stayed here numerous times and while we have always enjoyed our time here we won't be coming back anymore! I left something in my room and did not realize it until 8 hours later after we were already home. We called them up and were just given the run around to several different departments. Front desk passed us to security who passed us to key control who passed us to lost and found (which was closed) then back to front desk then housekeeping then back to security. Front desk told us the room had not been cleaned yet and housekeeping said the same thing and they all said to call back tomorrow when lost and found was open. Three different people said they would let the cleaning people know to look for it (we told them exactly where it would be located...right side bed table in the top drawer). The item we left had no value but was only my husbands security badge and IT token so its not as though someone would keep it and sell it. The next day when we called back, after getting ANOTHER run around we were told nothing was turned in and the room was occupied so there was nothing they could do but leave a message for the occupant and hope they look. I understand that my leaving my property was our fault but how about going the extra mile and sending someone to check when we called the first night and it was empty?? We spent one night there and spent well over $10,000. Over our last 2 visits to Mandalay we went from the initial sign up to Mlife all the way to platinum so we are not penny gamblers. You fail Mandalay...I guess we will take our business elsewhere which is a shame because we enjoy your hotel the most because its at the end of the strip so when we visit other casinos we don't have to back track but just make our way down the strip.

This is about my fifth trip to Vegas, staying at different places each time. I think by the things I measure these hotels on (mostly the room itself), this was not one of my favorite. It's hard to beat the snazzy rooms of some of the others down the street and this place doesn't really try. I was bummed they were out of kings and I had to take two doubles (no, I don't want to change rooms another day) and my view was obstructed. The floor's windows only were half the height of a normal view and while the view was of the gorgeous beach, wave pool and lazy river, it was half a view with iron work cluttering that up. Boo. The hotel room reminded me of a new apartment rental - the carpet was starched and crunchy under my feet and there was the smell of fresh paint and stuff that just reminds you of a new rental. 

To be fair though, the casino itself is super clean. Yeah, there's the smell of casino and smoke you get used to, but all it took was a walk through New York, New York to remind me that this place is much cleaner and fresher. Kudos on that, since I had to walk through it constantly. The food is insanely, insanely expensive everywhere you go and if there was a cheap meal in that place, I didn't find it. There are some good places in there though if price isn't an issue. I'll review them separately but the House of Blues Foundation Room and the oyster place were pretty fantastic. Lots of cool fruity drink places too, which was kinda cool. I liked how small (comparatively) the casino was to get from shopping to the tram to the conference rooms.

As far as conference rooms go, the only complaint was about acoustics in the rooms with high ceilings. Not that important to most of the people who come through here, but a tough thing for us at times. I know I'll be back in the next year or so here and I have to hope I can make time for the beach and pool.

It houses a large convention center, Shark Reef Aquarium, a collection of shops and restaurants and is home to Cirque Du Soliel's Michael Jackson ONE (which is a must-see). For convenience, there are two free trams that come about every 5 minutes and go to both the Luxor and Excalibur, saving some time from walking the long Strip blocks. I'll hone in on some main points and observations during my 3-day stay.

SECURITY: Guards are posted outside each of the elevator bays leading up to the hotel rooms. They require you to flash your room key before heading inside the elevators to ensure access to only hotel guests. Additionally, at the Cirque Du Soliel show, you'll walk through a body scanner and have your belongings checked before entering. This level of security seemed exclusive to just the Mandalay Bay as I didn't notice any similar precautions taken at the other resorts we visited. I definitely felt safe with these measures in place. 

FOOD: Inside Mandalay Bay itself, they offer a good variety, but most restaurants are moderate to high-priced. Even with to-go breakfast at their Orchid Coffee Shop, a simple parfait cost $8!! Between the Mandalay and the Luxor, there's an area called The Shoppes at Mandalay Bay where lunch and dinner sit-down restaurants appeared more casual and relatively cheaper. For example, Burger Bar appeared to be a popular pick and although we didn't eat there, it looked delicious. The Bayside Buffet was just alright - they cook their meats pretty well, but many of the veggies and starches were overly salty. I preferred their breakfast selection over their lunch, which says a lot since I normally am not much of a breakfast eater. 

ATTRACTIONS: Definitely check out Cirque Du Soliel's Michael Jackson ONE. There is less focus on acrobatics than other Cirque shows I've seen, but I promise that they do not compromise one bit on the excitement, precision and amazement that they're known for. 
Make some time to visit the Shark Reef Aquarium, especially if you're traveling with some younger ones. They also have a Polar adventure, which we unfortunately didn't get to see, but it's more of a virtual experience and short ride. For those who enjoy laying out at the pool, Mandalay has their own ""Beach"" and extensive pool area. Surprisingly, I didn't notice many pool-goers despite the sunny weather, but it appeared to be a place of solace away from the Las Vegas crowds. 

HOTEL ROOM: Three of us comfortably stayed in a two-bed room. The beds are pretty comfortable and the bathroom is nice and spacious. However, the shower doesn't have frosted glass, which leaves it transparent to anyone using the the sink. Just thought that was poor design. Don't touch any of the snacks or drinks in the fridge otherwise, it is possible that you will be charged for them - the front desk staff informed us, so I'm extending the word of caution. 
NOTE: If on the 7th floor, your view will be partially obstructed by metal bars. Keep this in mind if requesting to stay on a lower level. 

SERVICE: Each day, our room attendant left enough amenities for just two people. Given that there were three of us in the room, we had to request extra towels and cup (for teeth brushing) every day. She always provided the towels, but not the cup. Other than that, our room was always kept spick and span so all was good. The staff elsewhere from the Check-In, Bell Desk and in the restaurants also made our stay pleasant and memorable.

They wanted to give me a free night on New Years Eve. I had to read it twice to make sure I was reading it correctly. We didn't have real plans for New Years so what the heck and what better place to spend NYE then in Vegas.

We checked in at 6, I expected a line because of NYE, nope just an employee there greeting me and advising there was someone ready to check me in. Check in was quick, they had the room I requested.

The room was good size, not huge, not small, comfortable. The bathroom was huge though with a 15 in tv. Seperate shower and bathtub. There is another door where the toilet is. I hope you don't get claustrophobic, kinda small in there. The beds were comfortable. Nice 42 in flat screen. Everything seemed clean and up to par.

One complaint I have was the elevator situation, there was a line to get in the elevator. Then coming down from our room, we must have waited 15 minutes because the 4 elevators that stopped were full. I don't know if it was because of NYE or if its like that all the time.

The only restaurant we tried was Raffles Cafe for breakfast. It was good, would go back.

It was cold out so weren't able to check out the pool, one of the main reasons to stay there. We will have to go back in the summer to check it out.

Again, not a fan of the mandatory resort fee. It should just be included in the price. And what you get for with the resort fee most hotels give that stuff to you for free.

Now I'm sorry but thats just disgusting greed. There were a ton of them empty. If they adjusted the price they would actually make more money. I'd have paid maybe $20 
So 100 empty chairs or 100 chairs filled at $20 a piece. You do the math.

First issue: Parking policy.
Upon checking in, we asked the lady what is the procedure to charge an electric car. She didn't know, and proceeded to ask her manager on duty. Both came back with an answer and told me to pull my vehicle over in the valet area and they should direct me to the right spot. I asked if there is a charge involved. Both said ""No"". I then checked myself in to my room, went out to grab dinner and came to the hotel area around 9PM to the valet area to charge my vehicle. The valet staff surprisingly laughed and smirked at me when I asked the question on where to charge my car. This is the quote ""You got to leave your car with me buddy. And that's $20."" I told him that's not what the hotel said. He then said ""They don't know s*it. That's been like that since I worked here for years."" Very rude and demeaning. I just drove off.

Second issue: Room.
Room is perfect. BUT... in the middle of our sleep around 2 AM, we got woken up with a howling sound from the window area. After checking around for the source, it came from a tiny gap from a ""flap"" at the bottom from the window that can be opened and closed. We made sure it's on the closed position, which it's already is. We ended up trying to sleep with a howling wind in an otherwise nice 4-Star hotel. Seriously ??

Bathroom opened through white shutter doors, two closets, mirror, and carpet with areas that are fuzzy.  Not much of a view, weird X windows.

The food at the grill there is pretty good.  Good fries and veggie burger (2 boca patty with portobello mushroom), good pina colada, watered down but tasty.  And they have so many lifeguards.  About 8 to the wave pool...crazy..but feels safe.  And they have real sand at the beach.  Towels.  Guests only.  If you check out you can still go as long as its before 2pm.

The hotel room looked a little smaller than the room pictured in the virtual tour, but it was still really nice. It was a little disappointing when we first got in the room to see a note left for the last guests that they ""moved"" (not consumed) something in the wet bar and will be charged. I've been to many hotels with wet bars, and they at least allowed a little room in the refrigerator for guests to put at least one of their own items in. This is, after all the desert, and I would have liked to have some gatorade or other thirst-quenching beverage cold and available for me to drink in the middle of the night. It also was a little annoying that the remote worked on both the livingroom and the bathroom tv...so when the person in the livingroom changed the channel, the bathroom channel changed too, and sitting in the jacuzzi wasn't a good time to get up and press the tv channel button...But, the room was gorgeous, and clean. The staff were friendly and professional.

I also noticed that the ventilation in the hotel was great. Even as a smoker, when I went to Vegas the smoke in the air really got to me and I'd have to leave....now it seems to really get filtered out. A visit to Circus Circus confirmed that....

The buffet was amazing! $26 per person...not cheap, but the food was way better than other hotels I've been to in Vegas. I'll happily pay a few bucks more for palatable food. The breakfast wasn't as good as the dinner- the waffles were undercooked...but in general I'm just not as excited about breakfast anyways. The dinner, which starts at 4:30, was excellent! I loved their chicken fried steak. Being used to the excellent foods of San Francisco and NYC, it was good to see food in Vegas improving...it's now somewhere that those of us who live on the coasts can visit and actually not hate the food!

The things that attracted me to Mandalay Bay was that it's near the airport, the monorail goes through it, it was one of the few hotels with modern rooms (other than city center, which is four times the cost), and the fake beach! I have always had a fascination with fake beaches and wanted to check it out. I could have stayed in Vegas longer than three days because of all the pools and the beach, which is saying something because three days I'm usually wanting to come back home. It was a little odd that there was blasting music (music from my generation- the 80's to now), the lifeguards were yelling at people in the water not to do something, but they had no megaphones. I don't know how people are expected to hear them, clearly the offenders did not, and you could see the lifeguards frustration! Because it's not a real beach, holding your girlfriends hand and walking where the water is 3-4 inches deep at the ""shoreline"" is not permitted (probably because body surfers could hit them, but it really wasn't so crowded it wouldn't be obvious if someone was flying towards you, though I imagine at that depth the body surfer would get roadrash on the metal grate. It would have been nice if the pool area stayed open later.

Oh- one word of advice...if you'de like to do the pool\/beach area, it's best to either go before school is out for the summer, or if not you need to get there by 10am to get a spot...because even in May with no kids around on a weekday, there were few beach chairs (any spots to park your belongings and people) ...and there were only two of us going to the water. When we got there around noon, a guy came up to us because he saw us looking and told us to hurry up and get his 
spot they just left, and we got there right before other people did.

Oh, and because I know this can be an issue in Las Vegas, we found Mandalay Bay to be gay friendly, even to butch dykes (Vegas isn't very fun, often times butch dykes run into disgustingly homophobic staff and guests), and we weren't the only LGBT's staying there.

When you first get to the entrance, they have some tropical coconutty type scent wafting through the area.  My friend thinks it smells like summer.  She said that she loves the way that Mandalay smells.  I concur.  It was pleasant.

The rooms are pretty nice.  Comfy (almost too soft) bed, large bathroom, view of the pool.  Weird thing though - no fan in the bathroom.  Although, I think most hotel bathrooms don't have fans?  I don't know...  Also, the AC wouldn't get colder than a certain temperature even though you set it really low.  Maybe it's the struggling economy's effect on the hotel?  Who knows...

The pool area is a lot of fun.  I think there are five different pools to choose from.  They are known for their wave pool - which, I didn't ever venture to for some reason or another.  The first day we spent it at the topless pool - 21+ only.  It's nice, but you have to pay a cover charge to get in.  It was $10 for a Thursday, but I think the price goes up to $20 on weekends.  The next day we were lucky enough to get seats by the lazy river.  That was probably the best place to have real estate in the sun.  Reason being, that once you get too hot, you can just hop into the lazy river and wade along.  It was a blast.  The last day, we spent our day alongside one of the lagoon pools.  That was nice too.

NOTE:  Get to the pool early to secure a good spot.  The chairs get snatched up quickly.  We spent a lot of time watching a lot of people cruising around looking for chairs with no luck.

A couple more things:  Mandalay is the LAST hotel on the strip.  It is VERY FAR from the 'heart' of the action.  Plus, when we were there, the tram was not working - ugh.

A cab ride to downtown Vegas will run you about $25 w\/ tip.  The trip is worth it though because the gambling downtown is a lot more fruitful than it is on the strip.  Enjoy!",2,0,1

Elevators: yes....on my trip, the elevators for floors 17-36 i believe was backed up!!!!!!! I'm not sure if the front desk sent ALL guests checking in that day to this elevator but the line was so long it was irritating.

Also, since I was on floor 17, by the time the elevator got to my floor, there were no more room for me and my guest to enter. 
I've never had elevator troubles in Vegas...not even at the 3 star hotel. And THIS....is supposed to be a 5 star????? .............sure.

Didn't gamble here, just wasn't in the mood.

It's so far down the strip...I call this side ""the loser side of the strip."" No happenin' nightlife and its a walk to the better resorts.

Rooms: rooms started at 550sq ft. pretty big and room. It was clean so that was a big plus in my book. Only problem I have is THE LIGHTING!!!!!!! Its dim!!!!

POOL: Only thing I like about this resort was the pool area. The wave pool\/sand area was cool..never experienced something like that especially in Vegas.

Due to a minor billing technicality with a couple of rooms, which company resolved immediately, I was refused entry to my room and I was personally threatened by the rudest front desk manager to have me removed by hotel security, unless the billing issue was resolved. No apology was given to me, and when I calmly pointed out the sheer rudeness and disrespectfulness of that manager towards a hotel guest, she said that I was ""entitled to my opinion"".

It is a long walk through the casino from self-parking to registration.  If you have much luggage, drop you bags at the front.  Even in the middle of the night, there were 8-10 parties checking in ahead of us.  Check-in was handled efficiently and the line moved pretty fast.  I could see it moving a bit slower during peak periods.

We ended up with a standard room on the 3rd floor. The room is very nicely laid out with plenty of places to sit if you want to entertain.  There were a few minor wear and tear items like paint damage, but nothing serious.  Our view was partially obstructed by a wall or parapet.  Try to get a room on the 5th floor or higher.  The bathroom is pretty large, with a separate bath, shower and toilet.  The bathroom could use a little more light, but was very functional.

There were not a lot of people in the casino after midnight and blackjack was $15 minimum.  However, the casino was alive with music from various bars, including a live band.  The place must really rock during prime time.  We didn't have time to try any restaurants or the pool.  

One last item that caught my attention.  Every staff member we came upon was genuinely friendly with everyone giving us a ""hello"" and a smile.  This helped make our short visit more pleasant (along with the $30 I won at the tables).",0,0,0

There were plenty of towels, good shampoo and conditioner, and a nice smelling skin lotion. Two closets! Plenty of outlets to charge cell phones.The entire hotel was quite clean and in excellent repair. The view was gorgeous from the 34th floor. The views were even better on the 61st floor. But holy smoke, the prices! I expect room service to be expensive. I do not expect to be charged  $6 for 2 spoons and 2 empty coffee cups. The paper cups on the bar were $4.50 each. We should have gone to the dollar store off strip, like we did for a box of tea, a quart of milk, some joghurt, and fruit. All of it cost less than the same meal would have from room service, or even downstairs in the convenience shop, where one banana was $2.50. 
Outside there is a nice pool area, with a variety of types of swimming pools, a sand beach, and lounge chairs. Bungalows or Cabanas run between $325, and $875 per day. And the pool is only open until  8:00 PM. If you want an inner tube for the lazy river they are $20. Yes, you get to keep it, but so what? They're worth $5, and I'm not taking it home with me.

We live here in Las Vegas but we knew it'd be a late night we decided to also book a hotel room. Wanting to make this a special night, my boyfriend spent 2.5hrs on the phone with a nice girl from reservations picking the perfect room. A corner suite in the Delano tower with 270 degree windows. When we got there to check in we were told that that room was no longer available. Having already paid for the room and having spent so much time and effort picking the perfect room we begrudgingly accepted a ""comparable"" room in the Mandalay tower. When we got to the room it was obvious that we'd been lied to. It was a typical king room. Nothing special what so ever. We called just to see if what we'd already paid for our corner suite when we'd reserved our first room was in fact the same price for this mediocre room. Of course it wasn't. The room they'd stuck us in was much cheaper. We were both upset and our night was looking like it was ruined.
Luckily this is when my boyfriend got Assistant Guest Services Manager Damaris Acosta on the phone. She was incredibly sweet and moved us to an available suite. When we got there we were amazed by the 2 room, 2 bathroom, strip view suite. We loved it so much we booked the same room for New Years Eve this year. But that's not all Ms. Acosta did for us. When we got back from our concert there was a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries with a note apologizing for our experience.

I waited about 10 mins. but it was a Monday at 2:00, so it's probably a different story on weekends. Staff was nice and they were able to check me in a little early. It probably helps a lot if you book directly through them than other travel sites.

The pool is definitely a highlight. They closed at 8:00pm which is slightly later than from what I've seen at other resorts. There's also an adults-only pool that is less crowded than the common areas.

Rooms are nice and clean. The bathroom is roomy with a huge tub and a shower.

The only issue with this hotel for me would probably be the location. Being at the very end of the strip, it's gonna take you a while to walk to the center of the action. We chose to take Lyft on a few occasions which is way better than taking a cab. There's also a tram to the Excalibur which cuts down your walking distance and time, but you still need to plan ahead if you're on a schedule.

4. The next night we enjoyed the wave pool until they kicked us out at dinner to setup for a concert. To get back in, we were expected to pay admission. The concert at the pool meant you couldn't use the pool, or go to sleep as it kept the kids awake and also drowned out any movie you might watch.

There are several rather nice restaurants, but most seem slightly out of my price range for an average afternoon or evening meal.

The pools are amazing, but I can only speak to this from a visual inspection, and the words of friends. I have never personally taken advantage of them.

Yes, it is the last hotel on the south end of the Strip but it is not so far away as the Stratosphere is on the North end. It is definitely within walking distance to Tropicana Blvd. (MGM, NY\/NY) and there is a tram that connects Mandalay to the Luxor and the Excalibur. That being said, you can quite easily get to the center of the action in short time, while enjoying the relative quiet and solitude the location provides.

Rooms were well appointed. Nothing over-the-top but a few extras that were nice (large (52""?) flat-screen and a smaller one in the bathroom.) Could've been a little cleaner e.g. crumbs on the floor like they didn't vacuum so well after the previous guest, and gum stuck on the back of one of the loungers. Yuck!

One thing I don't get about this hotel is the $18 resort fee they tack on which doesn't get charged until the end of your stay. Why this isn't an upfront cost and\/or is included with your overall cost is beyond me. They give you a card which states what this cost covers which includes free Wi-Fi (""A $15 value""??? Really?) and a free USA Today at the shop downstairs. There were a couple of other items but they were more forgettable than these mentioned.

Pool\/beach area was great. Here's a tip, check the Bikini Bar for specials before ordering anything unless you're fine with paying $7 for a bud light and $12-$13 for drinks.

One major negative was the Concierge Service. Couldn't have been a more unhelpful\/unfriendly group of people. Instead of getting assistance, you will get blank stares and an attitude. I honestly don't understand this. Their job is to help people but instead they belittle them. Very poor form.

If you're dining in, I recommend sticking with Raffles. It is the cafe that serves a full menu night\/day (I think this is also where room service comes from.) The food is very good and will save you more time\/money than going to the other ripoff restaurants located on the property.

Negatives aside, this is a great hotel and if you're ok with not being directly in the center of the action then you will enjoy your time here. The spa is lovely as well and if you've already been to Vegas\/ seen all the sights and just want a place to chill then I highly recommend it.",2,0,1

We chose it because it was the best nightly charge while still remaining on the strip. The hotel was nice, the staff was friendly, and the price was right. Here's the issues: all day and all night you will here what sounds like a large creature in your drains glugging and bubbling. It sounds gross and it is gross. Vegas in general has some major plumbing issues I have found as this happened when I was at the Mirage 5 months back as well. You go to the front desk to complain and they pretend they have never heard of this before. It was so loud and so constant that my friend and I could barely sleep. We needed to sleep since we were trying to stay up late, but this was not an option. The walls are also so thin that you will literally hear all of your neighbors coming and going. If a door near yours opens or closes, your hotel door rattles and sounds like someone just kicked a large rubber ball against it. 
They supposedly sent someone up to ""fix"" the plumbing issue, but we had no sign of anyone doing such and no one ever contacted our room to make sure we were pleased. We should had been offered something when we checked out. 
This hotel is nicer and less dingy feeling than Mirage, so is your choice is between these two, choose Mandalay, but I could never ever go back to either because it is not possible to sleep! 
We ordered breakfast twice and the brioche and thee hashbrowns were delish! Coffee is good too. Room service at any hotel in vegas will break the bank. So insanely expensive!

I just got back from Vegas myself, and I stayed at the Mandalay Bay as well. That was you and your friends keeping me and my boyfriend awake that night? Haha, just kidding. 

But really I have to agree that the soundproofing was terrible. I don't mind the airport noise, because I live near one and actually find it relaxing, (I know I'm weird.) but the noise in the hallway was pretty bad at some points. 

Room: Beaauutiful and really modern. We had two Lounge Chaises right by the window, which is floor to ceiling, btw. The window offered a great view of the strip and part of the airport at night. The flatscreen tv was amazing. The bed was soooo comfortable, I think it had two layers of down comforters, and I felt like I was sleeping in a cloud. Ipod docking station was prime. It was nice to be able to listen to my favorite songs while getting ready to go out. 

The bathtub was enormous, and I got to watch movies while I relaxed. After the bath you can jump into the gorgeous shower, which is made of little non-slip stones, (there's no better way I can think to describe it, sorry!) and has a great shower head.  I did not want to leave. There was also a separate toilet room, and two sinks, how nice! I wish I could have stayed here my whole trip. 

The Pool:
You can't get in without a room key which gets scanned, and they know if you are really staying there or not so be careful! The only way I know this is because we wanted to take a dip after checking out and they asked us if we had just checked out. High tech fun spoilers! They let us in anyhow though. It was a little chilly, so I didn't enjoy it as much as I should have, but the wave pool is beautiful, it sounds like the real pacific ocean that I miss so much! There is even real sand beneath the lounge chairs. There is also a lazy river, but it was cold so I didn't go in.

The Casino:
Smells nice. I don't gamble so what can I say.

The Shark Reef:
Freaking awesome. Do it, its worth the money, but don't rush through it. Think of it as your little nature escape from Vegas for an hour or two.

The nightclubs:
I went to Rumjungle on a on a Sunday, it was down time for them. Cool bar though. After that I went to Ivan Kane's Forty Deuce. It was fun, tbat that is another yelp story to be told.

So why only four stars after such a glowing review? The check-out process was a NIGHTMARE. The lines are not formed at all, so people are just clustered together, and some of them apparently cant read. Check-In window is for when you want to get a room. Check-Out window is for when you want to leave and don't want to stand in line for  forty-five minutes behind all the bozos trying to check-in at the CHECK-OUT LINE!!!!! Really there is a reason for designated lines, and it is because checking in takes twice as long as checking out. True story! How irritating, they really should either rope off lines so that people can't stand to the left of the line and then cut you off, claiming they were in line, or not let people check-in at the check-out line. That is my only large and volatile complaint.",0,0,0

I need to personally thank Brittany for her help, she optimises great customer service. Also, I need to give a mention to Jake who made sure everything with our stay was good.
Once again, I will break down the property into the major pros and cons
PROS
Excellent ventilation in the main casino floor means people from California can breathe, quite frankly I cannot understand how people spend any time in some of the other Casinos.
Shops were again excellent, I spent more than I needed to all over the place, I didn't have time to visit Minus 5 this time but I can recommend it.
I enjoyed the pool area for the first time, I went to one of the quieter pools slightly off the beaten track but I prefer to have less people around me, I did walk through the main pool and it looked like fun although a little busy for my taste. Service was fast and efficient and drinks were reasonably priced.
Brittany is quite simply excellent at customer service, if I was in the industry I would steal her away in a heartbeat.
In room internet was excellent, I spent most of one day working from the hotel and enjoyed the speed.
Room excellent 
Food service in the property restaurants was above average as was the quality - price comparable to other properties
CONS
I had to think hard on this one, the only bad point I saw was that the 'adult' pool charges males a cover - I guess this is due to some of the Puritan values that came down from the Mayflower and because they can. I didn't bother going in, I am sure that there is nothing I haven't seen before and most of it won't be as nice. I am guessing that the bachelor party set would be fine with it though. It may be my European upbringing but I cannot really see paying to be in a topless area. This appears to be a uniquely American phenomenon",0,1,0

We were essentially forced to stay at Mandalay Bay since everyone else in our group of ~300 was staying there. The price was insane for that weekend; we could have stayed at the Venetian for about the same cost.

The room itself was fine, nothing special but certainly nice enough. I don't like the 3 pointed star design of the hotel. The wings were confusing and the hallways didn't feel intuitive. The restaurants in the hotel were also not on par with other hotels on The Strip. Given the far away location, this made each meal feel like a trek. The show at Mandalay Bay is also not one of the more popular ones in Vegas.

Was in town for the JT concert and Mandalay Bay was a great choice for our very short overnight stay!
Check in was a breeze! We arrived early (just before 7am) and the hotel was quiet. Rather, the whole city of Vegas was quiet as well-probably still asleep. 

We stayed on the 29th floor with an awesome view of the strip!

We didn't get a chance to see much of the casino, as no one in my group gambles.
We did take the tram from Excalibur. We walked from our end of the strip to the Venetian. So, definitely far!

We slept for about 2 hours and the bed was very comfy. I think the hotels need to upgrade their iHome pods... We wanted to plug in our iPhones into the radio, but it was only for generation 4 phones and older. At least the TV had music ""stations"" and we were able to turn it up, while we were getting ready.

We asked about a suite upgrade since our room wasn't ready and were told it would be 50$ a night but since our room wasn't ready she could do 30$. At this point I would think it appropriate to offer any other options that were available, however they did not. We took the upgrade but were then told the suite in Mandalay Bay wasn't ready either but that we could move to THE hotel. 
Once we got to the room I called to speak to a manager because it really isn't acceptable to not have a room ready so late in the day and to be charged for an upgrade when other options were available but not given. 
The customer service person I got routed to had no intention of listening to what I had to say or of giving me to someone in management which is what I kept asking for. She kept giving reasons for why it was ok that we were treated this way.

Our previous stay in Vegas was at the Luxor, for roughly the same price. I'll be using that as a comparison point.

We stayed her on a Wednesday night at the end of March 2016. We had a room with two queens and a room with a king.

The GOOD:

Basically everything.

- PRICE was reasonable, and certainly some of the best for the Strip. Our room cost something like 80 or 90, and with resort fees and taxes came out to something like $126.

- INCLUDED things are wifi (speed is fine, no password needed, just check the box saying you agree to terms and conditions when you try to load your first webpage), access to the fairly nice ""beach"" and wave pool area. (You'll need a key card for every person going into this area, or maybe for every room (e.g; if you have two people in your room, perhaps one keycard for your room will suffice).)

- The ROOMS were quite nice and clean. I didn't feel gross staying here. The rooms have a sort of modern 70s feel to them. They come with modern wall-mounted flat screen Samsung TVs, and those TVs have a panel near the desk beneath them that provides access to USB ports (for charging phones), and HDMI port (my laptop recognized the TV, but the TV didn't display the laptop output through this port. I had to switch to the easily accessible HDMI port on the TV itself to play video through the TV), component cable input, etc.

- The SHOWERS...oh, my. Hot water like it's coming out of a fire hydrant. Felt amazing. The bathrooms are very nice in general, and having a hotel shower that actually makes you miss your home shower? Not something you hear of often. One girl in our party actually commented that she could see herself just relaxing in the tub (who says that about hotel bathtubs?) and lounging around the hotel.

- The STAFF were all friendly, regardless of whether they were cleaning staff, people at the registration desk, etc. They all seemed to actually be having good days and be more than willing to answer questions. Typically, cleaning staff is rather distant and miserable in hotels, but here they contributed to making the stay pleasant.

- They gave GREAT SERVICE. We needed to get some documents from the garage (they don't tell you you need photo ID of the person whose card you're using), and when we came back to the registration area, they put us in a queue to go next without having to wait in the long line again.

We asked for two rooms on the same floor, and they, without asking, made arrangements for us to having slightly nicer rooms (two beds instead of one) on the same floor so that we could check in right away. Excellent.

But then it turned out we had someone in our party who feels what I suppose would be called claustrophobic when far away from the elevators. We felt bad asking them to move our rooms after getting into them, but they gave us no trouble and immediately found us new rooms -- again, nicer than we had asked for, and on the same floor as each other -- with one closer to the elevator. The rooms were on a higher floor, so we had a better view. And they did this all very quickly and without giving us a hard time or charging us more. On our way to the new rooms, a cleaning lady even asked if we were moving to the new rooms -- the front desk had already communicated with them that we would be moving!

Everything was just incredibly smooth and simple and very focused on making sure we had a good experience.

- The CHECKOUT PROCESS was simple. They emailed us a link (one of our rooms didn't receive the email, but checking out through the website was easy anyway) for online checkout. This link didn't require a login, and you could review your bill or checkout with a single button click. Very handy. So easy I double-checked to make sure we hadn't missed anything.

Speaking of checking out, you can still use your keys after you check out to get into the beach area. I'm told they work until about 3 o'clock, so you could get in before 3 and stay however long you'd like. There are drop boxes in the lobby area.

- The ELEVATORS don't make you wait long. There are banks of I think 8 or so elevators for each grouping of floors, so you're never waiting long. The elevators move very quickly without you feeling a thing. It's small stuff like this that adds up and makes the stay very nice.

The BAD:

- Apparently the website's certificate is not updated, or is from someone Mozilla doesn't trust. This isn't necessarily a warning sign of anything, but it could in theory open you up to attack.

- I didn't see a vent switch anywhere in the bathrooms, so if you want the vent noise for privacy or want to get rid of as much smell as you can, you won't get that here. Fortunately, the toilets in both our rooms were at the end of a long bathroom, where both the toilet and the bathroom had doors to close them off from the room. Two sets of doors provides at least some privacy.

GO HERE. We really loved it.

The only thing that was awesome about it was the gorgeous view from the 31st floor. The person helping us make a reservation was very friendly but everything else after that was mediocre. 

This was our first stay in Vegas with a baby, (yes even people with babies deserve a nice stay in Vegas, not just the single party people and childless couples). Upon arriving, we felt rushed by the valet because after all its not always easy to unload your kid plus the hundred and one things you need to take out. The gentleman at the check in counter was not very cordial and sent me to momma bear mode. 

The room itself was tastefully decorated, I'll give them that. The view of the strip from the 31st floor was beautiful but that's it in paradise. In the room there were only 2 pillows and only two towels. It's almost like they took our reservation very literal since I guess babies don't count. Heck, even a Holiday Inn is generous with their towels and pillows. I know it's Vegas and it's no place to penny pinch, but $4.50 so I can make myself a cup of coffee with their coffee maker? For that I'll just walk my happy behind to Starbucks and have someone make it for me. You can see all the overpriced snacks in the room collecting dust and good luck if you need to chill something in the fridge because it's full of sensors with overpriced drinks. If you move one without even consuming it, they'll try to charge your for it.

The next part was that the walls were paper thin. Our room had a connecting door to the room next door. If you crouch on the floor and look underneath the door you can see the movements of the people in the other room and you can hear EVERYTHING they are saying from our neighbors arguing saying that ""Anal counts"" to their sob break-up a few minutes later. Meanwhile, I am tired, I don't want to hear your drama! So I was not so sorry when our baby had his mini meltdown in the middle of the night.

The hotel is not too far from McCarran Airport, in fact, you can see it when you land.  The hotel is so far in the beginning of the Strip, next to the Luxor and their driveway seems like it's in the ""boonies"" as well.  They have a long, winding driveway that's surrounded by trees and bushes.

When we pulled up to the hotel, someone greeted us and made sure that we needed to check into Mandalay and not ""Thee Hotel"" because so many guests get mixed up with the two hotels.  The lines were long to check in but we didn't have to wait long.  The girl who checked us in was friendly but wasn't very forthcoming with information.  I had to ask her a lot of questions like how to sign on to get the free Wi-Fi, where the gym was located, pool hours, etc.  We also paid for a Strip-view room but when we got to our room, the Strip was nowhere in sight!  Instead of walking back downstairs to the lobby and standing in that ridiculous line, I called them from the room and explained that we paid for a room with a view of the Strip and we didn't have one.  The employee on the phone was really nice and apologetic.  She looked for another room for us to stay in and had them re-code our room keys.

We loved our room and had a decent view of the Strip and the airport as well.  The room was nice and clean and my favorite part was the spacious bathroom that had a huge long counter with 2 sinks!  The bathroom also had a small shower and a bathtub.  There are a ton of things to do at the hotel including shopping, eating, swimming (the pools are awesome, they even have a man made beach), the Cirque du Soleil Michael Jackson One theater, etc.  The casino floor is nice and it looks pretty ritzy compared to many other hotels on the Las Vegas Strip.  

Mandalay Bay by day is a pretty nice, calm and mellow hotel to relax at.  Mandalay Bay by night and weekend is a completely different story!  On nights were they have the Cirque du Soleil Michael Jackson One show and when Light (the nightclub) is open, it's party central!  When we first checked in, it was a weeknight and the casino floors were really quiet but once the weekend hit, the casino floors were packed with people, there was live music and everyone was having a good time.  On one of the nights, the valet was full and although we were hotel guests, we had to part at Thee Hotel next door which is a pretty far walk.    

Customer service was overall really good.  The valet was really friendly and helpful, so was the bell staff.  Room service was pretty good too.  We ordered breakfast one morning and they estimated the food to be at our room in 30-45 minutes but I swear they delivered it in 25.  The housekeeping staff was really friendly and all of them greeted us when we walked down the halls.  The check-out process was seamless, I believe I used the text option to check out and they e-mailed my receipt to me and sent me a text message with the confirmation number.  In the lobby, there was a desk where they printed our boarding passes for us.  Pretty convenient Mandalay Bay!  We didn't have to rush to the airport to get checked in since you offered this awesome service to us.    

Overall, Mandalay Bay is a nice hotel and I'd probably stay there again but it wouldn't be my first choice primarily because of the location.  It's just too far from the rest of the hotels on the Strip to be considered part of the Strip and if I plan to stay on the Strip, I would like to be in walking distance of the majority of the other hotels.  However, I guess it depends on what mood you're in and what type of vacation you'd like to have in Las Vegas.  I think Mandalay was going for that ""world away"" type of stay since their off to the far end of the Strip and they have a nice long driveway and parts of the hotel are really serene and relaxing.",5,1,4

He was professional, courteous, friendly, and totally wow'ed us with his typing as he looked up our room, settled the bill, etc.  Seriously.  And folding the bill was crisp, precise, perfect.  Best check out person ever!

Unfortunately, the rest of the stay was average.  The room we stayed in was really nice, but had a tremendous whistling sound whenever the wind blew (which it did quite a bit at night).  Also, we ended up locked out of our room, even the maid couldn't get in because the door had ""lost its memory"".  We ended up sitting in the hallway for 45 minutes waiting for maintenance, and this was a missed opportunity for Mandalay Bay to say 'sorry'.  

We also found out on Monday, after three days, that the penthouse we stayed in came with membership in the lounge on floor 62, but evidently that is only on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  That would have been useful to know so we could use it and get our free breakfasts, etc.  

Finally, the wave pool only has a wave every 5 minutes, it would be great if there were a few more waves.

Considering the bad taste we had at the last place, in us, we did our best to leave it with them and start fresh here.  The amenities were clean and fresh decor.  The wave pool was shut down, but I was told you couldn't surf it,  was told that people can body surf and boogie board it.  Any who the back to the room, my biggest complaint and it is a big one, is the bed manages the almost the impossible, they managed to make a bed extremely hard towards the center of the bed, (and I like firm mattresses) and yet very soft and spongy on the ends.  The bed comfort really didn't matter anyways, because at 2:30 in the morning a siren went off....  

A voice came up, from speakers in the room telling us of a situation has occurred in the hotel and we were to stand by further instructions were to follow.  This recording and siren went on for almost 15 minutes straight, it was irritating, we were tired and considering how we had to evacuate our last hotel on this trip the night before, we decided it was best to be safe and started packing our stuff up, should we have to get going.  By the time we had finished packing, the sirens expired and told us the situation was resolved and we can go about our business.

This message and siren for some reason continued to go on for another 5 minutes straight.   Dear god.  I know they are trying to keep us in the know, but it seems me and my g\/f seem to have bad luck staying with any hotels related to Mandalay Bay...

The hotel added charges that upon checkin I was told would be complimentary. Then it was a hassle to remove those charges.

We locked in a great deluxe room rate with a view of the pools for $129 per night. If you want a view of the strip it's $179 per night. Not the newest, most chic, modern hotel on the strip anymore but you can get a great value booking here now. The last time I stayed here several years ago, it was 400 per night so I can definitely appreciate the savings. The room was large and facilities are beautiful. Concierge and service was excellent everywhere we went.  Would come again! This hotel has an amazing aquarium,  several restaurants, 2 clubs, several bars. You really don't have to leave the resort if you don't want to. :)

Cons: This hotel is located at the end of the strip so it's  kind of a hike if you are looking to bar hop. $15 cab ride to other clubs & bars on the strip. Not the busiest but that's a blessing too. Some of the restaurants are overpriced but that's to be expected of vegas.",6,1,4

The pool area is still clean and safe as before. They let you bring your own beer and tube for the lagoon. For that part, it is a 5-star for sure!

The only reason I am giving 1-star is their internet. The free internet (not really free, part of the resort fee you pay) is provided by Cox Business Calbe. And guess what? They are blocking VPN and I cannot log in to my work to check email!

What got worse is that the support people denies they are blocking VPN. They make you think it is your computer. I googled and found a ton of post that Cox is blocking VPN.

It also looks like Cox has a program running in the background trying to identify and terminate encrypted internet access (easy way to identify VPN). When you first connected their internet (agree to terms, etc., and you need to do that every 24 hours in the hotel), VPN would work. Five minutes later, VPN got terminated and you were not able to use VPN again.

I am pretty high tech and so does my employer. I called my corporate tech support and we figured out why VPN is not working. So I ""worked around"" it and VPN started to work.

Guess what? The VPN got killed about 4 hours later. This time it looks like they reset my connection (I had to agree the terms etc again although I just did it  a few hours earlier). The VPN workaround no longer works. The workaround I had was pretty sofiscated and it looks like someone had actively worked on to block it.

What I really do not understand is why Cox is doing that. This is a business hotel and it is pretty common for business traveler to use VPN to log into their work computer. The VPN I am trying to use is Cisco VPN, which is also a very popular tool.

I stayed at Monte Carlo last year and had the same problem. Their internet is also provided by Cox.

VPN was working fine at Mirage last year. I think they do not use Cox.

It started with the snooty check in we received. It was my actual Birthday and the guy didn't even acknowledge it. Every other resort we were at had given us complimentary upgrades- but this guy was not having it !!

I think he was choked we booked through Priceline instead of the hotel, but Priceline was so much cheaper, ( even with my husbands Platinum rate )   

The room itself was ok. We were used to suites at 5 star hotels, so it was quite the switch, but it was only for one night, so we didn't mind. 

The restaurants here were all disappointing. There was nothing here we enjoyed. Especially the buffet - (see separate review) it was awful ! 

The pool was closed which was a shame because I think that would be the only reason I would return. 

Now the thing that really upset us was the fact my husband lost his passport in the room. Even though we were told that housekeeping and management were both going to look into it- nobody ever followed up with us. 

It took 2 weeks,constant calls and 3 in person visits with numerous supervisors before they finally let him up to the room to take a look. 

He went in and found it within 30 seconds wedged between the mattress and the side board. Can you imagine what else must lurk in these rooms that nobody has a clue about ?",14,8,3

Mandalay Bay actually reminded me a lot of MGM Grand with elevator room hallway layout.  Unlike MGM the waits at the elevators could be huge, I actually gave up the last time when I was waiting with about 30 people for 5 or so minutes and wandered off and found the service elevators.  Getting anywhere in or out of this place is a fairly long walk.  Tram to Luxor\/Excalibur were a nice touch.

Over all I liked this place but I'm tired of Mega Vegas hotel\/cities and will gravitate to smaller hotels (less people\/less walking) in the future.  Mandalay Bay is the furthest south hotel on the strip and a lot of walking or taxi to anywhere you need to go.

We were blown away by our room, a gorgeous two-bedroom suite with floor to ceiling windows, fantastic. While the rooms was amazing, many aspects of customer service were highly lacking especially for the premium price that was paid for our stay. First off, we had a couple issues with our bathroom. One of the mirror televisions was not working properly, so we called down to have it repaired. There are not enough customer service representatives on the phone so I was on hold for a long period of time. The bathroom lights then went out in the other bathroom, but we ended up surviving without them over the weekend. We called the concierge and front desk during other times of our stay and each time had 10+ minute waits.

The final issue came with valet. The valet is $18 per night, and with a high cost like that - you are entitled to a premium service but this was not done. We were on hold for over 10 minutes, just to call to bring our car around. When we got downstairs 15 minutes later, the car had still not arrived. After checking with the attendant it still took another 15+ minutes before our car came out. The attendant was the only one working, and the other individuals were also frustrated at the lack of people working and the delays.

We also left a bathing suit in the room and were hung up on by hotel staff, I'll be calling back again shortly.

The friendliest faces we saw over our stay were the front VIP check in workers, and we were always greeted by a smile by housekeeping as we walked down the halls, they were fantastic.

I didn't really get a chance to interact with the staff here (housekeeping, maintenance), so I can't really comment on the service. We had our do not disturb sign, or in Mandalay's case, ""Recuperting"" sign up the whole time, so we didn't have our room cleaned or anything. Overall, the hotel is a good one to stay out.

The decor has that tropical feel, very classy and doesn't have the cheeese factor. We don't get that obvious smell of being in a casino - the overwhelming cigarette smoke. Instead we're greeted with the signature ""Mandalay Bay Scent"". I'm not kidding, it truly exists. We were looking for that scent to purchase for the last 6 years until we found the scent sticks in their gift shop to take a bit of Mandalay home last November. I know what you may be thinking, no, not like the kind you find at Bath & Body Works. It's so subtle. 

The property is very light, open and airy. Again, opposite of many other hotels casinos that are dark and leaves that claustrophobic feeling with you unless you go outside. 

The rooms are gorgeous. Double doors to the bathroom, his & her closets, floor to ceiling windows, iPod compatible dock\/alarm clock, plasma tv, and pillow top mattress. The one feature I was kind of weirded out was the window on the wall of the bathroom. It has blinds! Kind of weird, but whatever, just leave it closed.

Word of advice, if you don't want to have to pay full price for the Shark Reef or watch a show, make sure you get a player rewards card so you can get comp'd for future visits. Oh and by the way, all MGM Grand (that's attached to the MLife player Rewards Card) properties has a ""Resort Fee"", so don't be surprised if you see it on your bill. The only exclusion to get it waived, is if your room is a comp. Don't be afraid to ask them to take it off. The worse thing they can do is say no, right?

If you're lucky enough to stay here during the busy months (like in the summer), get to the beach as early as you can to grab a prime location for a  lounge chair w\/umbrella, or cabana. The ginormous wave pool, lazy river and 3 swimming pools will be worth the trek outside. If you can't peel yourself away from the tables, but need some vitamin D, head out to the Beachside Casino where you can find Roulette, Craps, and Blackjack.

During this visit, I booked a really good deal for a 765 sq ft suite at the MB. Checked in after 9p and it appears there was a little discrepancy with my ""special requests"". Although they didn't vocalize it, the employee indicated that they would be giving an upgrade. COOL! 

Employees were super friendly and nice. This was definitely appreciated after a LONG day of travel and horrible dinner.

Turned out the upgrade was to the baller Media Suite (2170 sq ft.) OMG, this suite was freakin' AMAZING!!! 

You walk into a foyer and a half bath. Then you enter into a huge living area where you have gorgeous views of the pools below (from the 30th floor). Another room led into a media room with a 65"" TV and surround sound speakers. There was a bar and office area also. The bedroom had a king with walk-in closets and his\/hers robes and slippers. A long hall led you to the bathroom with dual-head showers that doubled as a steam room, a soaking spa tub, dual sinks and a separate room for the toilet. All the rooms had TVs and touch screen remotes to control the TVs and curtains.

Housekeeping was great with a clean suite to come back to and toiletries well-stocked.

The only negatives were:

-You're able to hear the neighboring guests in the next suite, but wasn't too bothersome since I spent most of my time soaking in the spa tub.

-I woke up several times around 4-5a. I want to say that there's a housekeeping closet on the other side of the bedroom wall???

-After video check-out, the TVs don't work. No biggie...

Def a memorable experience and will consider MB for future stays!",4,2,3

I was excited to stay at Mandalay, I had stayed there before and it was always really nice. The bad service started before I got to the hotel. I called and was trying to reserve seating at Eye Candy for the first night, no one answers the calls or resoponded to the messages. Then I arrived and my room of a king size bed was not available. They said they would call us and  let us know if their was a king size bed available the next day, since the next day was a Sunday I thought for sure since most people go home on Sundays. Well we didn't leave until Tuesday, and never a call. We left a message again for Eye Candy and a message to attempt to get dinner reservations for China Grill no one answered the calls or returned any messages. 
We ate somewhere else, and just showed up to Eye Candy making the best of it. Noticed there were several tables reserved and unused and they made it a point to not even let you set a drink down on those tables.
When I got back to the room that night a man passed out and vomited on the carpet infront of our room, the smell was horrible all weekend. On Tuesday when we checked out we saw the carpet being cleaned. Wow 3 days to get that done!
Oh on Sunday night we attempted to go to dinner at the steak place there, the host never looking up from the computer told us it would be a two hour wait...well if someone would call back or answer the phones maybe I would've made a reservation.

The crowd at Mandalay is mostly registered hotel guests.  Security prevents anyone without a room key from entering the hotel elevators.  Mandalay is also conveniently located for anyone who has to attend a trade show, the rooms are adequately sized & the hospitality is good.  Free wifi in the rooms and lobby are a huge plus. 

Compared to the other adjacent hotels (Four Seasons and THEhotel), it seems like a bargain.  Mandalay has the similar aromatherapy as THEhotel and the Four Seasons occupy the top floors of the Mandalay Tower, with similar room\/suite sizes and layouts.

Since 2008, Mandalay has worked especially hard to earn the convention & trade show business.  For conventioneers, inter-hotel shuttle service is excellent; and even intra-shuttle service from the lobby to the convention center is easy with two alternating shuttles.  To my pleasant surprise, there was even a shuttle to the airport.  Security is top notch at every level: from the elevators, to the trade floor & the private suites.  

I'd give Mandalay 5 stars if its catering improved to the level of Wynn.  Given the Mandalay's size\/scale, it's probably difficult to offer the same quality and variety.  But please don't stop trying Mandalay!  I would love it if you won the trade show wars.  To do so, you need only up your food game.",6,1,1

So this review is for the renovated rooms only, as I did see one of the old rooms and it was in pretty drab condition. Although check-in time is at 3pm, we were able to check in at 1pm for no extra charge, which is always appreciated. We were given a view overlooking the pool on the 11th floor and away from the elevators. 

The new rooms were clean and bright. The beds were made with downy white duvets and plenty of fluffy pillows. We each had a bed to ourselves and I was as comfy as a queen, almost more so than I am in my own bed! Floors were clean and there is also a long desk and a sitting chair. The bathroom was renovated as well with cream colored tiles, a large bathtub, shower with great water pressure, 2 sinks and an enclosed toilet. The WiFi in the room was fast! But the walls were a little thin. We could hear the people in the connecting room in the morning, and I am pretty sure I could hear the music from Light around 5:30am. So you may need earplugs if you're a light sleeper. Overall I wasn't bothered. 

This is a more family-oriented hotel because of the aquarium, wave pool and lazy river. They also offer an adult only pool, Moorea Beach Club (tops optional), and Daylight Beach Club for us EDM lovers. The pools are a little smaller than other hotels so it may be harder to find a chair. I also appreciate the fact that they have a food court that is relatively inexpensive.

When I did not feel the salsa was hot enough he suggested the special hot salsa from the kitchen. It is sooo hot they require you to actually sign a release for and bring it to you on a spoon.
My only complaint is that they will not sell the salsa to you. Its extremely hot and addicting. So much so we went back the following day. Q waited on us again and the second bartender, John, was also very attentive and friendly. John even stayed for a short time afterwards and had a drink with us and discussed the origins of  Tequila.

My boyfriend and I stayed here for EDC weekend and I would definitely stay again. Our flight landed at about 6:30am, so it was too early for us to check in when we first got there. We were able to have our suitcases held by the Bell Desk staff, who were extremely happy and friendly, which is always a plus. We walked around the hotel a little before deciding to stop at one of the restaurants in the hotel for breakfast. By the time we left the restaurant, it was almost 9am. Even though we were told the earliest check in wouldn't be until later in the day, we checked out the line to see if it was long since it was EDC weekend. The line was a little long, but since I am a MLife member, we went to that check in area to see if we could check in earlier. The employee that helped us was one of the nicest people I have ever come in contact with (I really wish I remembered her name). We booked a king bed, but all that was available at that moment was a 2 queen room. Since we were extremely tired and wanted to get a nap in, we took it with no problem. And we didn't have to pay an early check in fee!

Our room was definitely not a disappointment. Even with the two beds, there was a ton of space. The bathroom was big and spacious as well. The walk in shower wasn't big, but it wasn't small either. Our view was of the front of the hotel and we could see the beginnings of the strip. One of my favorite things about the room was the shades. Since we were there for EDC, we didn't get back to the hotel until 6:30\/7 in the morning, when the sun was bright and happy. When we closed the shades, it was like the sun was barely even there. Now they weren't the black out shades that other hotels have, but they were close enough for me! The beds were some of the best I've slept in (I also like my beds a little softer than usual). I also like having a lot of pillows when I sleep and we had 6 pillows to a bed, which was perfect! 

The gentleman that brought our bags up from the bell desk was extremely nice and helpful. He asked before going into the closet to grab the luggage holder (which was a surprise since most either don't bother using it at all or don't even ask). He asked what we were there for, if we've ever been to Mandalay Bay before and when we told him no, he was able to inform us of all the restaurants\/pools\/etc. that were on the property. He made sure we had our shuttle to and from EDC all booked and even asked if he could get us ice for our ice holder!

We went to the wave pool on our last day, and it was surprisingly semi-empty (no complaints here though). There were plenty of lounge chairs available which was a plus. The only thing I didn't like was the sand the lounge chairs were on (for one it gets very hot to walk on and two, when your feet are wet, the sand sticks), but it's not a deal breaker for me.

The hotel itself is very well laid out and clean. I don't gamble so I can't comment on any of that. The hotel did not have the nasty smoke smell to it that you have at other hotels. I was a little hesitant about staying there due to the location on the strip (so far from the areas we usually stay at in the middle of the strip) but the hotel has the tram that takes you to the Luxor and Excalibur, so it's really not that bad.

Customer service, cleanliness, and price go a long way for me. Being a MLife member, our 4 night stay (during EDC weekend) cost us about $760, which was not bad at all. While I do want to stay at every hotel on the strip at one point, I would definitely stay at Mandalay Bay again, without hesitation.",1,1,0

The hotel room was beautiful. Like others we did have housekeeping knock on the door super early each day.  We also booked a cabana at Moorea Beach.  

We brought a ton more money to gamble with and we spent a lot of time gambling.  The mlife program always told us to charge to the room because after a weekend of play, it would normally get wiped off.  

Here is the problem....we had achieved our new platinum status in one visit alone. Last year, it took 3 visits to get that many points.  We go to check out and not only did the casino host show up late that day in which we couldn't talk to him, when we finally did, he told me we didnt spend enough for comps and that the already comped room was enough for our trip.  He told us basically we aren't good enough to comp anything but as a ""courtesy"" he would knock off $100.  We spent over $5000 outside of gambling. $100 is a slap in the face.

I had my reservations at The Venetian and am a big Hyatt fan but my daughter insisted to stay here. So, here we go. The mood went off right from the check in point. We had left all the luggage at the bell desk which accidentally had our bag with the ID in it. The check in lady was not all courteous with us and had no smile on her face. Anyway, to get our bags from bell desk which we gave 5 minutes ago took 20 minutes to get everything back. Moving on, the room was nice but the hotel nickels and dimes you for everything. We had the bar locked due to our kids but were not told that a bottle of water would cost $8!! Moving on, the main reason to get here was the lazy river and the wave pool. I am pregnant and couldn't take the heat, so decided to sit in the shade but wow that would cost me $50..seriously? The tube cost, approx $25\/child, aquarium cost, approx $100\/family. Wave pool was closed for like 1 hour with no updates from the employees there. We paid $70 for a 6pm check out and asked for extra towels and a mouthwash. That's it...a mouthwash which the housekeeping refused to give us since we were leaving on that same day. Seriously..we didn't pay extra $70 to get such a horrible treatment from the staff. And now to top all --we lost our camera in the Valet office area. Within 5 minutes, we realized it and came back from the car but again the horrible, rude lady at the Valet area told us she didn't see it and told us to go to lost and found, security and other places to look for it rather than checking the security cameras which are right above her head. I mean what's the point of those fancy security things if they don't want to use it. The security was at least helpful but they lied that they would check the cameras but nope, no one actually did that. We don't blame them for our loss but at least the staff there should know how to treat their guests properly and efficiently in a professional manner. Not once, did any of the staff there smiled at us or treated us like we were actually in a 5 star Mandalay Bay!!",0,0,0

It seemed like we got a luxury hotel suite for the price of a Motel 6. Our suite was extremely spacious and roomy. The master bathroom had a his and her sink, a gigantic jetted tub with a seperate shower. It was the exact layout of what we would like our future dream bathroom to look like. The service was great and the 2nd day we asked for an extra blanket and they brought it up right away. After a while, the room service dept. called us to make sure we received it on time. I thought that was very nice of them.

In terms of dining, there is a Starbucks on the resort which was a lifesaver for me, but other than that, everything was too over priced. $17.99 for a lunch special?

Misti suggested that I stay at Mandalay Bay and I am very glad I did! During past visits to Vegas, I've spent time in the main areas of Mandalay Bay, but this was the first time I was an actual guest. I was pleased with the pricing of the hotel and I was also very pleased with the service and experience. Check-in was seamless and they told me that they will check guests in all throughout the day as long as there are rooms (unlike some other hotels). 

Rooms 

The rooms here are incredibly spacious. My room had a mini hallway, plenty of walking room, a huge King bed, couch, chair and flat screen TV. The bathroom was a walk-in with a separate enclosed area for the toilet. My view wasn't so fabulous but I barely had time to look out the window so it didn't really matter. I felt like the room was very clean and being Vegas, this is very important to me. 

Pool 

The famous Mandalay Bay pool. While I didn't get to actually enjoy the pool, I did manage to sneak down and take a look. This pool transforms you to the beach meets spring break all year round. They have a wave pool, full sandy beach, huge bar area, and plenty of room. There are actually five pools and you can choose between the party pools and the quieter one. It was almost overwhelming to see so many options and such a display. 

Amenities

The casino is nice with plenty of different games and there are several different restaurants to choose from. Within the casino, they have a House of Blues, steakhouse and a frozen yogurt shop just to name a few. However, Mandalay Bay is connected to Luxor and also has an entire mall of shops to walk through. The shops have stores like an Urban Outfitters, candy shop, sports store, Burger Bar, funny sock shop, jewelry, etc. They aren't very expensive shops, so don't visit if you're looking for your high-end designer shops. These shops are more economically-friendly.  

Next time I stay here, I might check out THEHotel because it sounds even more fabulous than the rooms at Mandalay Bay. 

PS - I'm also pretty partial to this hotel because I ended up winning $100 at the video roulette table while I was waiting to be picked up to head over to Misti's event!",6,2,5

I would not think to come back here ever ever ever. Overall my stay here this past weekend was horrid because it was one bad situation toppled on top of another. Room was booked under casino in APRIL and we did a follow up a month before arrival and THE SAME DAY AT 6 P.M, but based on availability, our suite at THE hotel was unavailable. Maybe it would have been nice if they did a follow up. We called at 6 p.m informing them of our arrival but at 8 p.m, the hotel changed it by downgrading us. Mind you we had a large group and a dog (Mandalay Bay does not welcome pets) so we had to drop off our dog elsewhere. Very understandable because that is noted on the terms and agreements. Secondly, after going back and forth with the front desk, they informed us that a room would be ready in an hour because it was not clean. Arrival to the hotel was almost at midnight. So my group and I resorted to canceling plans on a Friday because it was too late to go out. They gave me a petty $50.00 for food credit then bumped it up to $75.00. It was a complete waste of our Friday night so this bootleg comp money could not buy our happiness. We got in at 12 a.m, and got into our room at 2 .am It only gets better, our belongings had to be hauled from THE hotel to Mandalay Bay and our car was at THE hotel garage to top it off. 
It the midst of all these issues we decided to move on, well that didn't happen.  We needed extra towels and that was an annoyance because it's so SIMPLE. Housekeeping completely forgot to bring the towels, fine it happens. I went down the hall to scavenge from them myself, then to find three different housekeepers that were unfriendly to say the least. I went to all three of them and they did not want to spare me three god damn towels. Is it that serious? I HAD TO CALL HOUSEKKEPING so the supervisor could walk me to where the towel storage room.
The hotel room was very clean ! Minor issues were a lot of the outlets not working at all. The a\/c was not working sufficiently because it was extremely hot.
Valet didn't want to take my car and had to debate with the 118 degree heat on why they had to take my car in. That was insane because they wanted to send me to THE hotel parking lot, creepy and confusing cause that's where we got transferred from.  
Management called our room because they found out how horrific our situation was; mind you none of us complained what so ever. The manager was accommodating but again, trying to buy our love with the petty comps, she bumped it from $75.00 to $150.00. I felt as if they throw that in your face just to justify all the bad that went wrong, Nope doesn't work. 
On Saturday, our room was NOT CLEANED, and no we did not have the do not disturb sign ETC. We didn't call to complain. All I did was kept my mouth shut because I was trying to enjoy an eventful weekend. I had to call for toilet paper and toiletries on different occasions. 
What was supposed to be a three night stay turned into two night stay. We needed to vacate because we were very annoyed with this hotel as a whole. Coming back to this property is highly unlikely. What a weekend ruined. Never again !",5,1,2

It's still a nice hotel today, check in is always easy for my family, rooms are nice, big bath tub etc but I just feel it has gone down in quality.

The hotel is connected to Mandalay Bay Place which is just a small shopping center, really nice but it's more high end things. it leads straight to the Luxor so you don't have to go outside if it's blazing hot. 

I always liked the pool area too. The wave pool, lazy river and regular pools give you more of a selection. though, as the years keep going by it seems more and more kids have accidents in the wave pool and lazy river.. 

I'd say the only thing bad is that there aren't many ""fast"" places to eat. They have buffets and some restaurants with a dress code but there isn't any place in the hotel where you can grab food fast and take it back to your room. I always had to go to the Luxor.",1,0,0

So the wifey and I found some pretty sweet deals on flights and decided to hop over to Las Vegas to chill-lax. After spending a week trying to find the best deal, we decided on Mandalay Bay. We got the rooms for 150\/night + 100 promotional food credits. We've seen better deals, but because of the Chinese New Year's festivities, it was the best we could find. 

The casino was easy to navigate and rooms were pretty spacious, but I do have a couple minor rants. 

1. My biggest complaint in the room are the doors. They auto-close, so if you're not nimble, you'll get smacked in face. Also, some people like to poop with the door open. I happen to enjoy my wife's company while going number too and I find it amusing to gross her out. It was a lot of effort to sit on the toilet and prop the door open with my leg. 

2. Yes, this hotel is slightly older, but what's with the half-ass repairs? One of the things I noticed when I opened the curtain is the black tape around the windows to seal up the drafty windows. 

4. I hate decorative pillows. What's the point? They're too scratchy to sleep on and I'm not going to be sitting in the room admiring them. After dumping them all on the floor, i was left with a wimpy pillow that barely fits my big head. 

5. 28\/night resort fee? Damn. If I read the fine print and realize there was a 28\/night resort fee, I would have searched harder for a better deal. These fees are charged so I can use the wireless internet, plus have access to their 4 tread mills in the cardio room. Lame.

6. The casino was filled with older folks, so there weren't too many hoochie mamas running around where their butts hanging out. Big minus. 

7. Their main attraction here is the shark tank, but they charge 18 bucks to get in. Personally, I think they should open this to the public and draw more people to the casino. That's just my monopoly 2 cents.  

Overall, I thought this place was just average. There's nothing really exciting about this place and the atmosphere is really draining on the Vegas experience. I wanted to rock out with my cock out, but instead stayed in the room to watch Storage Wars on A&E. 

A little about my credentials:
I just an average joe, that travels a lot for business and pleasure. I'm an Elite Premier member for United, Gold Member for Marriott, and Gold Member for Hilton Honors Reward. I usually book hotels in the range of 130-160\/night depending on location, amenities, and the year the hotel was built\/renovated.

You don't need to leave the resort if you don't want. There's plenty to eat and do right there, including a House of Blues concert venue. But you can also walk indoors or take a free tram to nearby casinos Luxor and Excalibur. 

Rooms were nicely appointed and quiet, away form the casino. One note, depending which way your room faces, you may hear planes taking off at the airport, which is very close by. It wasn't a big deal. I didn't notice them until about 8:00 a.m. I'd say ask for a room on the other side of the resort, but then you're probably facing the highway, which might be noisy as well.

The Cons- We were told we would have a room with a view of the strip. Instead we had a view of the airport. Most the staff was not very friendly and it took forever to get a free drink while playing the slots. The games were ok but didn't really keep you playing for a while. Had better luck in old Vegas. The drinks at the middle bar were 25.00 for two well drinks. Very expensive for the amount of liquor that were in them. We went there for the pools and only the small pool was open. This was not told to us prior to visiting. We still had to pay the resort fee though. When we go back we will probably not stay here unless something changes.

Also, read the ""small fine prints"" on their promotions they send you on e-mails.  Per day = per day and per stay = the entire stay and not every day of the stay.

There is a similar promo that I had previously but on the small fine prints on the very bottom says per day not per stay.  Just a word changes and you'll end up paying more to eat...

Excellent: quality and cleanliness of the room

Very Good: Three Starbuck's locations in the hotel.  Great for the next morning!

Ok: friendliness of the staff

Overrated: The pool area!  I booked this hotel because I heard the beach was just amazing.  I actually prefer the pool at The Hard Rock to this one. I had to get to the pool by 9:30AM to get a group of chairs.  Luckily I'm even an early riser when I have a hang-over.

Good: Spa Mandalay... not excellent because of young 22 year-old girls chit chatting with their friends while I was trying to relax.  The whole spa doesn't need to hear about your hook-up from last night.

Perfect: My Swedish Massage from the spa.  I wish I could remember the name of my practitioner.  It was absolutely wonderful!  I wanted to get a second massage the next day, but couldn't justify another $160.

Absolutely Wonderful: The evening we spent at The Foundation Room.  This place is second to none.",0,0,0

Rent a cabana at The Beach ($825) on Saturday and a nice sit down dinner later that night. 
To start, the lady at regristration ""Theresa"" was so RUDE! She made us feel like we were not welcome there.  Next, our whole night was almost ruin; as I was giving my credit card to our hostess for our bottle service at ""Light"", their bouncer, ""Control"" staff was telling me that I don't belong there and try to escort me out. I was going back and forth with him for about 30 second until the hostess stepped in and stopped him. This hostess, for half of the night, was not around to service us. I thought I paid for bottle service and not self service. The next day, the sevice at the rented cabana at The Beach was lacking.

Between the TV in the bathroom so you can watch March Madness basketball games from the tub, the spectacular view of the strip, the ENORMOUS sports book with tons of seating and a cafe inside of it, the shark reef, the no-cover lounge\/dance club in the middle of the casino and the friendly cocktail waitresses, you don't even have to LEAVE the Mandalay.

Rooms: OK I do agree with another reviewer who says the soundproofing is terrible.  Well, I sort of feel bad for the people next to us because with 17 drunk people in our room playing flip cup (what are we, in a frat?) and blasting music (they have these cool iPod dock speakers), we were probably the noisy neighbors.  So watch out for this if you are planning a romantic weekend.  If not, you should stay here if you want a party suite because the rooms are very spacious.  The beds were unbelievable, the view was so so so spectacular (be sure to book a view room) and the bathroom was really luxurious.  

Service: Everyone from the bellhop who suggested that I bring my case of water into the hotel when he saw that he had to transport 37 gallons of vodka up to my room, to the woman who took off an incorrect charge on the room bill, were all extremely friendly.  Customer service is one thing Vegas has down pat.  That and taking your money for it. ;-) 

Sports book: One of the reasons I chose Mandalay.  They have, hands-down, the BEST sports book in Vegas.  I was shocked when I saw others were so shitty (i.e. NY NY, MGM).  Mandalay Bay has literally like 60 stories of TVs and ample seating.  You can always get a seat and a waitress.  The spreads were also better here than other casinos.  

Clubs\/Bars: The Eye Candy lounge was great.  HUGE flat-screens to watch the games and a ton of seating you don't have to pay for.  They make this awesome drink called an Antioxidant -- with fresh berries too.  Bit of a girly drink, but if you get it as a shooter is still actually surprisingly refreshing and then your friends won't make fun of you.  The Mix has an awesome view, great photo op but not so great music.  It's OK though, because I got to witness my friend try to make out with another friend in a storage closet and get caught by security and kicked out.  There's also a guy standing outside the clubs with passes and if you tip him $20 he'll get your whole group in for $10 a head rather than $25.  Worth it if you're in a big group.  Not so worth it to pay $25 cover for a club that plays crappy techno mashed with Journey.  But if you're a guest, you only pay $10 cover anyway.  

Buffet: The Bayside Buffet is good for dinner but just OK for lunch (they have pretty much the same menu but no fresh seafood at lunch).  $26 for dinner on a weekend is pretty good for Vegas I think, comparable to other places.  Prime rib, steaks, fresh crab legs, shrimp cocktail, pizza, a pasta bar, soups, fresh salads... all pretty common buffet fare.  Their dessert bar was humongous too.  But I think I've been to better buffets.

Pool: Jesus, I did a lot at the Mandalay.  Their pool area is AWESOME, but just beware that it's really crowded.  If you go by yourself you can find a lounge-chair and drag it anywhere you want, but if you're in a group, good luck finding a spot for more than 3 people.  The wave pool is fun, but their hot tubs are EEEEEEEEETY BITTY LIVING SPACES (gold star for anyone who can name that reference).  No more than 5 people at a time.  

What else?  Oh the tram connects you to Luxor or straight to Excalibur, and from there you can get to MGM or New York New York pretty easily.  We basically didn't leave that one corner of Vegas the entire weekend and I didn't really mind.

I used to stay at the Luxor and take the tram but I could not deal with the delays and BS. Once I even stayed at the Excalibur (Crap-calibur)......I said once, will never again. That was my fault for waiting too long to confirm my trip. I can no longer tolerate Vegas for more than my yearly visit of a week (5-6 days) and even that pushes my limits. But the Mandalay really helps me deal with the situation. It is a not a gaudy tourist trap like other places.
 
My trip this year started with a delay leaving LA so when I arrived in Vegas I was ready to hit the bar, one snag was my requested large King was not available. The young lady at check-in was adamant that I take a double bed room and maybe check later in the week for something else. Yeah right. I was booked all week starting the following day (Sunday 8 am) with conferences back to back. Meals are for networking and getting deals done, so no chance to break away. And I had my girl coming to stay with me during the week. I asked to speak with a supervisor, the young lady disappeared to the back office, reemerged a few minutes later to let me know they found a room with my requested specifications. Great! I thanked her completed check in and went to the room. 

Housekeeping was just finishing, room high up was spacious and well cooled since it was boiling the evening I checked in. The bed was very comfortable, high count linen and big fluffy pillows. There was a nice small desk in one corner and the other a small sofa and table. A touch lamp in the middle. The bathroom had his and hers sink and a great tub for two. The suite was larger than my first apartment. The TV had external inputs locked out; boooo. 

During the conference one night I had some reading to do from the next day's sessions so I had room service, the food was actually good. I had a Kobe beef burger, very juicy. Also hit the bar for drinks, not bad. 
What I really like is that Mandalay has an area between itself and Luxor that has shops and restaurants. We had a meal at Burger Bar, shopped at Fredrick's and The Art of Shaving. I went to the lounge upstairs which was decent, nothing special. All good stuff. 

I had dinner and lunch at a few of the restaurants in the Mandalay Bay, my girl did get a massage at the spa. She said it was relaxing. I also recommend Fleur de Lys for formal dining and red, White and Blue in addition to Burger Bar for casual. 

The valet experience was positive, no wait each time I went to retrieve my car. They did change policy. I can no longer call from my room to have the car ready when I arrive downstairs. Luggage porters were all great. On check out we had a small Asian woman, I wanted to help her load the cart but she was like a demon, she got the job done in a blink of an eye. 
Check out was easy, no problems. Next year I will budget for a suite at The Hotel.

Pros about the suite: So we had a mini fridge (without that obnoxious mini bar where you move something... and get charged for it. I hate that). We were able to blast music throughout the suite (and no one complained even though I could hear it down the hall) and each bathroom had a TV screen, Jacuzzi tub and shower. I also liked that the toilet was separate from the bathroom, so while getting ready people could use the facilities without having to kick me out mid-curling my hair (has been a problem in the past with 12 girls getting ready at once in one bathroom). Our room had ceiling to floor windows and an awesome view of the Mandalay Bay sign and Luxor. 

The good..about the hotel: The concierge desk was very helpful, and ordered balloons to celebrate my brothers birthday. They were prompt and very professional. They also had extra towels and when I asked for extra soap, shampoo and conditioner they sent up a BAG full. thank you! I was slightly concerned with how far off of the strip it is, since I've been to Vegas a few times with girlfriends and we loved to roam to all the different clubs. I've stayed at the Venetian and MGM grand which are more primly located on the strip. Except I never really had the desire to leave the hotel, there were consistently multiple bands playing with an active dance scene. Music ranged from 80's to now, but it was always a good time. We saw people of all ages dancing, from 20s-70's and even some entertaining druggies who thought they were talented salsa dancers, except they weren't. I was dying from laughter waiting for him to drop her, at some points she didn't even have her eyes open for most of it. Heroin is a hell of a drug people. It was great cause after I had danced through my buzz I would just run upstairs for some shots and a beer and I would be set again for my next adventure! 

The Bad: the extra fees tapped on.... a little ridiculous. just in taxes, fail Mandalay Bay, Fail. This would probably be under my ""ugly"" category if I had to pay for it, but I have amazing and loving parents who took care of the cost for me. WINNING! You still suck for it though, Mandalay. Next, Its a little far off the strip, and by a little.. I mean FAR, WTH!? I know this isn't the hotels fault, but seriously? I got off the greyhound bus and instead of paying a 90 dollar cab ride, I chose to take the Deuce.. awesome transportation, except it took 1 HOUR AND 15 MINUTES TO GET TO THE HOTEL. 


THE UGLY: This pool situation is ridiculous. I came traveling with a few boys, and after spending an extensive amount of money on a room, THEY STILL HAVE TO PAY 50 DOLLARS EACH? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Someone needs to do something about this, especially since that pool isn't even nearly as cool as Wet Republic. So instead we decide to relax by the wave pool.. NOT. I sit down for 2 seconds near the start of the wave pool just to get my legs wet and I have a lifeguard blowing a whistle in my ear demanding me to stand up. WTH MANDALAY? WHY MUST YOU HIRE LIFEGUARDS THAT THRIVE ON YELLING AT 20 SOMETHING YEAR OLDS THAT WANT TO SIT DOWN FOR 2 SECONDS? Rude, Second we go to get into the lazy river and have children stepping on us, pushing us into walls. We even had 7 year olds knocking our 20 dollar drinks into the water, awesome. 
Look Mandalay, if I wanted to go to Chuck E Cheese, I could easily do that. Except that's not what I signed up for. Cant you make a kiddy pool or something? Going to your pools was like free birth control, I never want to have kids.

Breaking things down:

Rooms:
The rooms are pretty nice by Vegas strip standards.  (Note that Vegas strip standards are pretty darn high.)

Food:  The food's a-ok here.  The Noodle restaurant is pretty good.  (I had the Pad Thai).  The buffet is pretty much your standard Vegas buffet.  You can probably save on food by looking for a buffet pass at the cheap tickets booths on the strip.

Casino:  It's nice, though the rules aren't very liberal.  Minimums are higher.  Put simply, I probably wouldn't gamble a bunch here.  But I'm cheap, and I also don't like to lose a lot of money.

Rates:  ""Out of the box"", they seem to be on the high side of reasonable.  However, a friend of mind got me a discounted rate once.  I'm not sure how he did that.  I feel like you can get comparable rates at other strip hotel \/ casinos that offer the same quality of room at about the same cost.

Location on the Strip:  Put on your walking shoes...  it's located on the very end of the strip.  The monorail that goes between Mandalay Bay and the Excalibur helps a bit, but if you want to get to the main monorail, your closest stop is the MGM grand.  That's a looooong walk.  Actually, I measured--one way, it's at LEAST a .65 mile walk, making it an even 1.3 miles round trip if you decide to wait for the monorail to Excalibur.  If you decide you don't want to wait for the monorail, double the distance (if you walk inside--that's exactly .65 more one way, 1.3 miles round trip) or shave off .02 miles one way if you walk outside.  (Inside's nicer.)

It's also kind of crazy that you have to walk through what seems to be the most non-direct way through the MGM casino to get to the stop...  gee I wonder why.  However, the mall that's attached to Mandalay bay (that connects it with the Luxor) is actually pretty nice.

Overall:  It's a very nice hotel, though my main gripe is the location.  It's awful far south to get the full strip ""experience"" easily.  I'd say there's less of a plethora of those jerks sitting there bugging you with ""GET A GIRL TO YOUR ROOM"" cards in the area, which is nice, but if it means that I don't have to take a taxi to get to the monorail or walk for over a mile (round trip), then it's not the best location.",2,0,0

We had a deal on a room, like everyone does in Vegas now. I remeber paying over 300 once upon a time for a room. It is considerably less today. You have to call down and ask for a robe now.

Mandalay was next on my list, and I'm very glad I tried it.  Although at the extreme south end of the strip, which makes it a little inconvenient, they have more than enough to keep you busy and offer a tram that takes you to Luxor and Excalibur.  

We stayed in what they call a Great Room Suite, and what I call a ""starter suite.""  Although it could use a little touching up (it showed some signs of wear), it was damn nice.  I need one of those double-chaise-lounge-rectangular-couch-things!!  The double sinks were nice, and my wife and I are still debating whether the tub was made for two or three.  Maybe we'll settle that next time.

The only real problems with the Mandalay were (1)  the housekeeping service, and (2) the lack of cheap food options.  Housekeepers were extremely friendly and polite, but inattentive.  When you have to call down because they forget to leave you some toilet paper, there's a problem.  And when you've been drinking for 12 straight hours, there's no real desire to spend $30-75 on dinner.  Fast food will do, but you have to hump your ass all the way to Excalibur to find anything cheap.  And you better do it before 10:30, because that's when the tram quits running, and who needs that kind of exercise late at night?  

On the up side, EVERYONE I interacted with there was professional and friendly.  I wish I could remember the name of the guy who checked us in, because he deserved a pat on the back.  And although it took me about 3 days of slot playing to finally get a drink from a cocktail waitress, I must say that she was very nice and prompt, and circled back regularly once I finally popped up on her radar screen. 

Will I stay at Mandalay again?  Hell yeah.  It's a step below places like Aria and Venetian, but it's much nicer than many of the places I've been.",2,1,1

Housekeeping did a great job. Stayed in a Deluxe Suite Room, which had 3 TVs and 2 separate bathrooms. Room was so new, that the part of the hotel we stayed in was still being worked on. We had a beautiful panoramic view of the city, it just took our breath away.  

We ordered room service the first night and they informed us that it would take 45-60 minutes.  It ended up taking the 60 minutes, which was fine, because they did let us know in advance. Food arrived hot and was tasty. Air conditioning worked great and bedding was clean and we slept soundly. The room had robes, slippers, a large light up makeup mirror, and even a scale . Parking was easy and convenient with large spaces to park your car. I have a new car and always worry that someone is going to ding my car, but as I said, spaces were large.

Pool was a little cold both days we used the pool. 

I gave the hotel 4 stars instead of 5 because of the construction and the hotel could have done a better job with the signage. Hotel is large and a couple of times we got confused as to how to find our room. There just was not enough signs and sometimes I felt we were going in circles. However, staff was always helpful with directions.

Hotel is on the outskirts of Las Vegas Blvd, but they do have a tram that will take you to a few of the neighboring hotels. Lots of stores and places to eat.

I felt the price was not bad for what we got. 

We will be back!",1,1,0

I've moved my way up the strip so to speak staying in the dumps, (Westward Ho, etc) all the way up to Mandalay Bay. Since my first stay at this hotel 8 years ago, I've returned every year. 

The thing you have to understand about this hotel is that it's one of the largest resorts on the strip. So when you go will definitely dictate some of the availability of services and your overall experience. It's definitely not the cheapest resort either. However, for me personally the days of cheap buffets and rooms are long gone. Now days, cheap prices in Vegas tend to also attract the rift raft. For the most part, Mandalay Bay's clientele range from your party crowd having fun, then there's the metro always pretty crowd and finally the older hardcore gaming crowd. I've never felt like I need to watch my back in the place. Although I do have to admit I love going downtown for the cheap gambling (odds are better.) 

With that being said, I really enjoy the resort. They recently updated all of the rooms. They're modern but not gaudy. For me, the room is simply a place to lay my head and take a shower. If you're into the views, I don't think you can beat the northward strip view rooms. Raffles cafe is a good 24 hour restaurant. Especially after a long night out on the town. The gaming is good and for the most part the table handler's and pit bosses are polite, personable and will help you out when you're deciding whether or not to hit on that 16 or bet that pass line. Just a word of advice about the gaming though. If you're going to gamble at the property, join their players club and use it. It costs nothing and is good towards room discounts and free tickets to shows, etc. Plus the points are good at all the MGM properties. 

The pool area is large and there's several pools to choose from. But you need to get there early. Otherwise you're going to have a tough time finding a spot. This where all the kids are going to be as well. If I may borrow my brothers quote from another review on this site. ""Vegas is no place for a family vacation. Take your fucking kids to Disneyland, not a place famous for gambling, sex and getting piss-drunk. I don't fuck up your Legoland vacation by getting hammered and then hitting on your wife after spending $500 in a strip club so don't fuck up my vacation by bringing your hyper kids to Vegas and letting them run around while screaming their heads off. Deal?"" OK. There's my gripe about the pool area. 

Oh and one more suggestion about the restaurants. If you plan on going, make reservations. Especially on the weekends.",1,2,1

Mandalay Bay is a nice and comfortable hotel.  It also typically offers fairly reasonable room rates.  Unfortunately, it is also quite far from The Strip.  You can walk to get to the hotter casinos though it is going to be a long walk.  The Mandalay Bay does offer a free tram to get you to at least Excalibur though it is still quite a bit of a walk if you want to get to Bellagio.  In addition, the the tram's hours are not that great.  The first tram of the morning is actually surprisingly late.

Since the Mandalay Bay's location is not close to much, guests are going to expect a lot of dining and activities in the hotel to stay entertained.  The good thing is that the Mandalay Bay delivers here.  They have a wide variety of restaurants--both casual and upscale--and the great thing is several of these restaurants are open for both lunch and dinner.  This Mandalay Bay also has a nice convention center area.  I think their shark aquarium is quite expensive for what it is, but it still provides a non-casino, non-dining experience.  Mandalay Place is the one letdown.  It is small, the shops are not that great (shops veer too much on the novelty side), and the bars\/restaurants are a tad boring and lacking energy.

The rooms at the Mandalay Bay are fairly nice and comfortable.  Some of the rooms have a little wear and tear and the rooms are not as luxurious as some of the best hotels on The Strip.  That being said, Mandalay Bay (probably because of its location) offers some of the most reasonable room rates on The Strip and rooms at Mandalay Bay are nicer and more luxurious than the other lower priced big casinos on The Strip.

Service was good on my stay.

As already mentioned, room rates are often very reasonable at Mandalay Bay.

Mandalay Bay is a good option in Las Vegas if you do not mind taking cabs everywhere or are planning on spending most of your time at Mandalay Bay.  If you really want to go out and explore The Strip though, you might find Mandalay Bay's location very inconvenient.

Like other major casino hotels on The Strip, parking at Mandalay Bay is free.",41,27,35

ROOM: Okay, so I didn't book this room, my friend did all the planning and all the booking stuff and she was excellent in choosing this hotel. I absolutely loved it. Although our initial room was to have two queen sized beds there was a bit of a mix up and we ended up with a room with just one king sized bed. But, they were gracious enough to bring up an extra roller bed of sorts. We had the option of changing rooms, but we were quite comfortable where we were. The bathroom was quite spacious, a large tub (our temporary alcohol fridge for the weekend... LOL) and a standup shower, two sinks, large mirror stretching across the room and a private room for the toilet itself (so people can still use the bathroom when another needs to do their business!). We also had two closets, lazy lounge couch, great view, and a flat screen t.v. I was impressed especially since the beds and pillows were really comfortable. The maid service was just absolutely great, since we were a pretty messy group, but every time we come back- everything was in place and there would be new towels on the hangers, bed made, new champagne glasses, etc.

HOTEL: Loved, loved, loved their pool and beach area (to the MB Beach review!) and it' definitely something worth checking out. It's so nicely kept and it's just so fun and relaxing to be when you have nothing to do an the sun is out. The hotel itself is really grand, everything is embroidered with gold and deep colors to give it that rich and sophisticated feel to it. I also like that that they have shitton of ATMs around (I know being a casino and all), but there's a $4.99 charge on it. I rather walk down the street to BOA and use my own bank. ;) Sadly, although I thought it was a pretty nice hotel... It's not exactly the prime spot on The Strip so getting places can be a little tricky. Taxis were our mode of transportation, but I know not everyone wants to pay for it.

The lobby is spacious and there's always something new to see.  I like how there are a lot of dining options since Mandalay Bay is a bit farther than where all the trendy hipster places are.  Want to switch up the scenery?  Head over to Luxor which is conveniently an escalator ride away.  You can also head over to Excalibur and take their tram but why would you want to?  :x

The rooms itself are spacious.  While almost as old as Monte Carlo, it's definitely in better shape.  The carpet and furniture could probably use a bit of a deep-cleaning but the grand downy bed makes up for it.  I could have used more pillows though since I never use the gross body pillow or the decorative ones in fear of how dirty they are and such.  There's a huge tub in the bathroom and Lush Cosmetics downstairs.  Do the math.  Bath time fun, babie!  I only wish it was a fancy Japanese jacuzzi tub like at Cosmo.  Ooh lah lah.

Some cons though: Ridiculously thin the walls are.  I could hear the people next door opening their curtains and showering!  Not to mention all the loud drunk people walking up and down the hallways at night and in the morning.  The toilet is also insanely loud.  Since they have the throne room separate from the rest of the bathroom, it's even louder.  Like seriously, I thought I went deaf the first time I flushed.

First, a few positives: 

-The pools are beautiful. The wave pool is fun, and river is nice. It's crowded, but hey- that's Vegas.
-The tram is free and accessible. It goes to Luxor and Excalibur. From Excalibur you can easily walk to New York New York, MGM, and other hotels right on the strip.
-Close to airport ($15 cab)

Now for the negative aspects:

-The valet did not take our car...we did not get an explanation other than they did not have enough staff, they didn't even take our things. We had to self park our car...WAY in the back. Bad start.
-It's Vegas, I get things are expensive - this isn't my first rodeo..but it's ridiculous here. They can inflate the prices even more because they know there is no where easy to go.
-It's off the strip.
-The dealers are MEAN. I consider myself to be very easy going at the table. My mom and I were having a great time just playing on roulette, and she got a phone call. She stepped away from the table to answer (you can't have your phone at the table) and when she came back, the dealer said ""wow, I didn't take you for a hooker, who is calling you at midnight?""...and not in a funny way. Another was at another table, the woman told my mom ""what kind of mother drinks with their kids? That's bad parenting."" Seriously? I'm 28. But wow, just not a fun crowd. There were other poor experiences, but these ones stuck out. 
-The maid service knocks on your door at 8am....it's Las Vegas. Even when we had the do not disturb on! I'm lucky if I get back to my room at 2.
-the shark reef is costly; no discount for being a guest.
-the food is poor and over priced. Raffles cafe is just bland, and we didn't get served for 45 minutes.

In all honesty, I would rather stay at the Monte Carlo than here! It was a bad experience and we will not be coming back. I recommend the hard rock if you are looking for tropical pools - that's the one we have been to before, but decided to try Mandalay bay for something new.

The main highlight for this hotel is the Mandalay Beach! Enjoyable for the kids and adults alike! Oh, and don't forget to sign-up for M Life so you can get the deals in Vegas.

Update: After checking out, my husband realized that he had left his some of his clothes in the drawers. We went back to the hotel that day and the front desk  gave me a room key to go back to the room to check the drawers. Unfortunately, the room had already been cleaned and his clothes were not in the drawers. I went back to the front desk and was directed to security so that they can check the lost and found. 

I had to walk to the other side of the hotel to the security who called the lost and found. The one person who sorts through all the items given by housekeeping could not find it and I was told to call the next day once they are completely finished with sorting the items by room number. 

We called the next day, and spoke to a woman from lost and found who checked in their system based on room number. She told us that they had not found anything. 

Very frustrating process and so disappointing that my husband's clothes were missing considering we followed-up
on the same day of our checkout. 

I hope management will be able to address this.",1,1,1

I think someone at this place needs to take a course in how to run a hotel.  Lots of problems with the basic simple stuff:
1)  We checked in at 3:00pm on a Friday.  An enormous line of people wanting to do the same, which is not surprising as 3:00pm is the earliest check in time. It is also not surprising as 12,000 people were going to be at the Event Center  that night - a fairly high proportion of which would be staying at the hotel.  So why were only about a third of the check-in desks operating.  The girl at the front of the line was hopeless.  Shouldn't she be assessing the length of line, and getting more staff out to help if needed, and apologizing to customers for excessive wait times?
2) Having made reservations for two rooms and checked in after the 3:00pm check-in time, it's a bit hard to take when my room ""isn't available"", and they don't know when it will be available.  All four of us had to wait in one room for a call to say when our room was ready.  I made a call to check after an hour and we finally got our room after an hour and a half - 90 minutes!!  What the heck was everyone doing?!  Or why not just put me in another room?  I complained about the excessive wait and asked to be compensated in some way.  All I got was a ""we will sort something out"" - surprisingly enough nothing was sorted out!
3) We had a knock on the door that same afternoon, which I thought must be a personal apology for the problems we had faced through check in.  Wrong.  It was someone asking me if we were checking out?!  What the heck is that all about - we had only just checked in!

The stay from then on wasn't too bad at all.  Restaurants and bars were all good.  The kids enjoyed the pools. Staff at the taxi line, left luggage etc were all great.  There were a few fairly long waits for elevators but nothing compared to what was to come.

4) On our last morning, we left our rooms to go for breakfast, with the aim being to return to our rooms to pick up our bags before leaving.  I had clicked the 'express checkout' box in an email that was sent to me that morning little knowing that it would lock us out of our room.  Although rather strangely my daughters still had access to their room.  So while the girls were packed and ready to leave, we had to wait 20 minutes for someone to come and let us into our room.
5) Those 20 minutes it seems were crucial - we came out of our room a little before 11:00 to meet our daughters in the lobby.  What followed was farcical. We joined a line of probably about 25 people at the elevators (we were on the 24th floor).  Not surprisingly at 11:00 (the check-out time) there will be a lot of people using the elevators.  Little did we know that the system would just grind to a halt.  We waited for about 30 minutes.  A few packed elevators stopped with maybe one or two people able to get on.  A frustrated employee even called down to check if everything was working - which apparently it was.  I can only assume this happens most, if not every, day.  What a ridiculous design.  There are clearly too many floors and too many rooms served by each elevator bank.  We ended up being shown to a service elevator that finally got us down to the lobby about 40 minutes after we left our room.

Needless to say - we shall not be returning to Mandalay Bay!  Maybe for a drink or a meal - but certainly not to stay!",0,0,0

King size bed was comfy as well as the sheets... bathroom was spacious... bathtub was good to soak and relax... plus it had TV so I managed to watch... of course... ESPN... while soaking.

Today is my first day here, and I'm excited for the rest of my stay.  Although Mandalay Bay is on the edge of the strip and far away from the action, the casino is still packed, and the restaurants certainly have business.  Mandalay Bay is definitely not outdated or dull, the entire resort is beautiful.

Check In: Checking in was no problem, I checked in around 3:00 and there was a short 3 minute wait.  The lady who helped me was very nice, and got me the room\/view I wanted.  In front of the check in desks there's a mini aquarium with lots of colorful fish and some small sharks where kids can wander as the parents check in.

Room: I'm staying in the standard room and it's quite nice and spacious!  I have a view of the strip which is pretty and nice.  There's a pretty good size flat screen tv which is great, and there's a pretty big glass table with a chair.  Attached the headboards of the beds there's a light that you can move and use to read.  The room has 2 good size closets with many coat hangers.  The bathroom is absolutely amazing, they have a separate bath and shower and 2 sinks with lots of counter space.  There's a separate tiny room and door for the actual toilet, that has a phone in it.......interesting. The best thing about the bathroom is that there's a mini tv in there so I guess you could soak and watch.  Although I think taking baths in hotels is unsanitary I still use the tv when I'm getting ready.

Restaurants\/Buffet: The buffet isn't really on the pricey side, and the food is pretty good. It's not absolutely amazing, but I definitely don't regret going.  Mandalay Bay has a nice selection of restaurants, but they're pretty dang pricey.  There are 2 Starbucks on the casino\/restaurant level, and also a yogurt place if you're looking for just a quick snack.

The deal we booked with Mandalay had daily Brunch\/ dinner included. However , when we saw our interim bill during the stay , we realized that we had been charged some random amount of 40$. Not knowing why, i spoke to the front desk and they said that they had charged us for the Brunch. Two things to be noticed here, first as i mentioned the booking which we made had brunch inclusive, so there should be no additional charges. Second , even if they charged us for brunch (30$ each) , they should have charged us either 30$ (single person) or 60$ (for both of us) , but they charged some random number which would have gone unnoticed had we not seen the bill.

We got that settled after speaking to the front desk on the day of checkout (again a time consuming process knowing the rush at the holiday season - i almost missed my flight back to DC ). 
After we came home,  we saw they had charged us again for the Brunch(this time an accurate charge of 64$ (60 +  taxes). 
Such things go unnoticed if you are not regular is checking your account statements.
I had to call up Mandalay Bay again and had to go through the hassle again of explaining them to remove that charge.

This morning I looked at my credit card statement and there was a charge from the Mandalay Bay.

Called the front desk and initially the woman I spoke with denied that any charges were sent through to my credit card. I asked for a manager repeatedly and she kept saying there were no charges and that I should call my credit card company. Eventually she put me on hold to find a manager. Ten minutes later the same woman returned and said that the charge was the ""resort fee"" and that when the MGM sent me over there they only agreed to pay for the room & tax, not the resort fee. I told her that no one had told me that and that I had even asked why my credit card was being swiped when I checked in and that the resort fee was never mentioned. Her response was that it wasn't Mandalay Bay's fault and I should call the MGM if I had a problem.

Janet was to give a $50.00 credit for a miss understanding that a member of the desk staff told me. She also, was to have the signed receipts of the bar charges.  When checking out, well you guessed it, she did not give the credit nor did she have the receipts and she was gone for the day.
 
Casino
Had an issue with a machine it would not take our money nor give us our ticket.  After 20minutes or so we stopped William.  He called Sonia.  She came over and fixed the machine.  Kudos to the both of them!
While playing Roulette, we tried to get drinks from the cocktail server but there didn't seem to be one.  We asked Stacey, who we thought was the pit boss, to call a server.  He told us, he was just a fill in and can not do that.  I had to go to the bar to get our drinks, oh well. The dealer, Paul, was the reason why we stayed at that table for over 5hours and dropped a few thousand dollars. 
Christopher, another fill in, gave our players card to someone else, not sure if he even gave us credit for our play.
The last night, we played some Roulette with Gina - great personality and very funny but the best was Sheri, the blackjack dealer and Sean the pit boss.  We played blackjack until 4am.  Sean told us we had at least $130.00 in comps.  I thought that was low due to all the time and money we spent at the tables.
 
Players Club
On arrival we meet Egar and Darius - two great guys.
On check out - we only had $108 in comps. How could we have at least $130 just a few hours before? 
 
VIP Services
Patty was able to find us 311 tickets - which was the reason for our trip - we can not thank her enough!
 
Food
Lunch at Red, White and Blue was the best.  The burgers were cooked to perfection.
The quality of room service was somewhat you would find at a Hilton.  They were rude and the food had no taste.
The Noodle Shop - pad thai was greasy and bland.
Eye Candy charged gratuity to our room when it should have been for beverages.

really, very nice front desk people, but how many times could you possibly run out of rooms to put us in? twice is twice too many. it's not like we check in late either, so it doesn't make sense, unless of course they put the comps at the bottom of the list? or maybe we're at the bottom rung of the VIP tier. poop. the first time it happened, they ran out of king non-smoking so they put us in a king smoking. our lungs were dying through the night, so we asked to be switched to a king non-smoking the next day, and they mistakenly put us in double queen non-smoking. we were like wtf (in a nice way of course). and were finally switched to the correct room. holy ballistics. what a pain in the arse. the second time, we didn't bother and they just housed us in a double queen on a ""nice floor"" (the 9th......................)

rooms are ok. they have the basics and a little extra that you would expect from mandalay. sad to say, I almost feel like they dumb down the service and amenities in order to make THEhotel shine (which it does, but that's another story).

There are occasions when we treat ourself to evenings on the Strip though, and those evenings are usually better if you do not have to drive home afterward.

This past weekend was such an occasion for myself and my husband. We were seeing a concert on the Strip and I was able to get us a suite with a jacuzzi tub at Mandalay Bay on a Friday night for less then I could get a ""deluxe"" room at Planet Hollywood (where the concert was).  

Check in at Mandalay Bay is officially 3 p.m. but we were checked into our room and relaxing on the comfortable bed by 2:30. I love when hotels are able to get people checked in early. There is a $15 a day resort fee at Mandalay Bay (MOST Strip casinos have a resort fee), one of the things you get for that fee are 2 drink coupons, which pretty much makes up for the cost by itself.  

Our room was nicely decorated in brown tones with green accents, had a large bathroom with dual vanities and a huge tub. There was a view of the I-15, nothing to write home about but having a nice view wasn't something I was too concerned with. The main reason I wanted to stay at Mandlay Bay? That pool!!

Only some Strip casinos allow non-guests (Vegas locals) into their pools... Many only allow them in on certain days, or for a fee. Mandalay Bay only allows non-guests into the pool during the nighttime concert series, for a fee. So this was my first time seeing the pool. And wow, is it impressive. We started out in the adult-only area, Moorea. Moorea is usually has a admission fee ($50 for men, $20 for women, even if you are staying there) but they were having a special performance by a singer so we were able to get onto a guestlist for that and get in free. (I will continue my thoughts on Moorea in a different review). 

The rest of the pool facilities were fabulous. So many different areas... A lazy river! Wave pool! It looked like the had a thousand chairs to sit in. And surprisingly enough, not too many screaming children.

When going to redeem my offer that was agreed-upon over the phone I found out it was not what we had agreed upon. This organization and staff are highly behind times when It comes to Nevada's laws and regulations. Would give zero stars but I guess that's just not possible.,0,0,0

I am hearing impaired and listen to my television very load. I stay at Mandalay Bay multiple times per year and have for years. I woke in the morning wondering why my remote was off my bed and back up by the television. In the morning, I received a phone call early and was wondering whom might be calling. They said it was security, I had to put something on and answered the door. I was told that my television was to load and they asked me to turn it down. I said I was sorry and did not realize. The security officer at that time told my this was my second complaint and in the event I received a 3RD they would ask me to leave the hotel. I explained that I was not aware of another complaint and again explained I was hearing impaired. He then told me that they entered my room the night prior to turn off my television. Ladies no notice was left and they went to my bed to remove the remote, when the television was across the room. I had no clothing on and I truly believe this is unacceptable. I went to the manager and then was told that I needed to file a complaint with security and I did. The security officer was helpful and they moved me to the penthouse so no one could hear my television. However, I wanted this addressed and I was told that I would hear from night security later and I never did, but to make me feel better I was told that it was not only one man in my room but two. The hotel knew I was traveling alone and this should never be able to happen. I like to travel alone and I will tell you this experience has changed the way I feel about being in a room alone and now I lock every door in my home while I am sleeping. This is not how travel should ever make anyone feel in life. I own a real estate firm and manage many properties and I could never enter with out leaving notice and could only enter based on a emergency and I really do not feel that a load television is an emergency.",4,1,0

I will break down my stay here at the Mandalay and get you some tips and how to have a good time and save some money at your stay here.

** Tips on saving money when booking here.  
My girlfriend and I wanted to get away for a few days, we are from So. California so I went on priceline and was able to make an offer for 2 nights ( we came on a weekdays so it would be cheaper & to stay away from weekend crowds & traffic)  on January 28-31.  We made & offer and it was accepted for $45 a night!!! 
So with taxes it came out to $118 for two nights through priceline.  * note* when you get there they also charge a $20 per night resort fee which is not bad because you get free wifi and a newspaper.

**Gambling
If you are going to gamble i suggest doing it during the day.  The table limits drop down to $5 a hand on most table games i.e blackjack, 3 card poker etc.. The waitress' are good with drinks as long as you tip them and for the most part dealers were friendly. I actually won the times I did play blackjack here and had a good time doing it.  If you get a players card they give a voucher to take to the cashier and if you give them $20 they give you $30 in chips to play at the table so make sure you ask for that.

**Attractions
I highly recommend doing the shark reef exhibit. It was 18$ per person but it was well worth every dollar of it.  They have shops like a little mini mall and it was cool to walk around and spend some time looking at everything they had to offer.  They always have concerts & ufc fights held here so on your trip you should check the calendar to see that is an option.  
*We did not go outside to the pool because it was January and still pretty cold.

**Food
Mandalay Bay is very big and I really did not eat at the restaurants so I can't really speak of them but they had a wide variety to choose.  They did seem a little pricey, they did not have a big choice as far as a lower end dinning but you can do like I did and we went out to eat like at Margaritaville and we went to Denny's and Dicks last Resort next door at the Luxor.  They did have a couple Starbucks in there and also frozen yogurt and ice cream which was pretty cool.

**Rooms
Hey for $45 a night I could not complain.  They had 2 flat screens a 32"" in the room and a 15"" in the bathroom.  They have his\/her closets and sinks and a shower as well as a bathtub.  The soaps and lotion in the room are good and they smells really good, they do not cut corners in saving in cost.  The water pressure is good and another good note is the cell phone service, I have Verizon and I had full bars throughout the whole casino.  It worked better than the free WiFi so I just shut off the WiFi and used my Verizon 3g signal and it worked really well.  Beds and pillows were comfortable and elevators are were quick to get up to your floor and you did not have to wait a long time to wait for one.

**Misc.
Vallet service was good.  They were not the fastest of all the casinos but they were not the slowest.  Staff was friendly I have no complaints about that.  Check-in, When we got there they did have a long line but one of the ladies said don't worry it will go by fast and she was right we waited less than 5 minutes and she got us our keys and up to our room.  We got a room high up 27 floor and she gave us a room with a partial view which wasn't bad.  If you want a full view of the strip it is an addition $20 but if you can just get the partial view.

That's about it, another thing to remember is that the Mandalay Bay is on the South of the main strip so if you had a car like I did we did not mind at all because we got in our car and drove down and didn't have to pay for a taxi.  The parking is free because you either self park it or do vallet and just tip the guys a buck or two.  They had a tram that goes into the Luxor and Excaliber but we did not use it so I can't tell you about it.  

Enjoy, hope this was helpful!!",0,0,0

I LOVE the Shops at Mandalay Place!  So convenient and a great selection of different things.  Expensive brand stores and touristy souvenir  shops are a dime a dozen in Vegas, so I'm impressed that they have searched to find a great mix!

It is less loud, less crowded, ran well...  We did a lot better gambling there.  The complementary coffee is strangely addictive.  A few grumpy old dealers, but oh well.  One of the funniest dealers I have ever played around was there, so he made up for the grumps.  Our room was nice at the same time not, I think maybe it is dated or the housekeeping needs a little tune up.

My sister and I made reservations to come to Mandalay Bay after a long drive from Grand Canyon trip.  The reservations were made more than a month before arriving, paying a high cost for the day before Labor Day.  
It didn't matter because we knew the Labor Day weekend will be expensive but we just wanted to make sure our family and I can stay in a comfortable and clean room period. 
As soon as we arrived at the check-in,  a lady at the front desk already looked so tired and right away she gave a hard time getting our rooms that we expected to get as royalty Mandalay members.  I guess we were not good enough to get good rooms, all she talked about was that we were blockout from all the potential good rooms and we're just stuck with four rooms that were only available for that night which were all under 6th floor with crappy view of the roof of the casino floor and parking lot. 
So it leaved us with no choice.  We asked to talk to the manager but same thing.  We were stuck with no choice.  It was like take it or leave it. 
We both got rooms in the same floor which was 5th floor.  No view and the best of all, the rooms smelled bad. 
The most odor came from the shower sewer.  We tried running hot water with shampoo but didn't help. 
My room was so dusty and linens had stains and hairs. 
The towels were with stains and full of dusts including remote, hair dryer, furniture and the phone in the room was so dusty.
We had to turn off the a\/c  because we were itching and caughing the whole night.  Come on now...  the outside temperature was above 100 and turning off a\/c in that heat was sleeping in a sauna room. 
My room was the room located at the end of the hallway next to the  emergency stairwell where I believe no one had used that room for a long time. 
Overall, the stay at Mandalay was a big mistake and full of disappointment.  We always chose Mandalay for the past 5 years due to nice pool but never again in the future.  It was definitely time to move on.
Two stars not one because I complained and some issues were resolved at the final minutes of our stay.",4,2,2

We decided to stay at the Mandalay Bay located at 3950 S. Las Vegas Blvd. Las Vegas, Nevada. We were given room 21128 for the night. We did not check into the room until about 1 AM. While unpacking and getting ready to go out, one of our shoes got kicked under the bed that was near the bathroom door. While looking for the shoe, I touched something under the bed. When I pulled my hand back out and looked I realized what I had touched was a condom that was left under the bed.  I washed my hands and finished getting ready because I was furious. I took a picture of the condom. We left the room for about an hour. When we came back to the room, I called the front desk so it could be picked up by housekeeping. The woman I spoke to at the front desk sent security up to the room. The security officer who came up refused to come in and pick up the condom that was left there. I asked him to look at the picture of it, but he refused to look at the picture. I went and got my phone anyway so I could show him the picture that was taken. The security guard left, leaving the condom still under the bed. I called the front desk again around 7:30AM or 8:00.  The condom was now under the bed during our whole stay at the Mandalay Bay. When I spoke to the front desk, I asked to speak to a manager. I spoke to Jeremy. Jeremy and a woman came up to the room at almost 9AM to pick up the condom. During that time I told him about everything that had happened. The woman who was with him who I am assuming was the head of housekeeping was smiling and smirking like the situation was a joke or funny.  During the conservation about when the corporate office would be calling, the woman told me they would eventually get in contact with me and it would be taken care of.  I let Jeremy know how dirty and germ infested a condom is considering all the bodily fluids and bacteria that was on there, since no one knows how long it was actually under the bed. Jeremy was very unconcerned about that He said well they picked it up. That was after I had touched the condom. He said that someone from their office will get in contact with me eventually. I proceeded to tell him I was going to be contacting the BBB and the Health Department because this is unacceptable. He told me he would contact the corporate office and they would call me. I still have no received a call back from the corporate office. I called the corporate office myself and the woman I spoke to said someone would call me back, but she didn't know when. I called the Mandalay Bay to confirm that Jeremy had sent over what had happen to them so they knew what was going on. He was not in the office today, so I spoke with another woman who said she was a manager. I believe her name was Amanda. She told me since we checked out and the condom was picked up the issue was resolved and there was nothing she can do for me. I proceed to tell her the story that security refused and it was there for almost 5 hours with their employee's knowledge. She was very rude and did not want to do anything.",3,2,0

Yes, if you arrive at check-in peek hours expect to wait at least 45 minutes in line. I suggest you do the mobile check in, which is what we did, and cut down on that time significantly. 
The pool was the best in my opinion. Yes I did take my kids and they loved it. They kept jumping back and forth from the lazy river, to the wave pool, to the regular pool. If kids bother you I suggest you go to the 21 and over pool. If you wish to use inner tubes you do have to purchase them, as they do not rent them any longer. $18 for the small one and $22 for the big ones.
The room was clean and extremely spacious. The only reason why this review is a 4 star and not a 5 its because of some issues that we had regarding the room. When we got back from dinner one night all the lights from the bathroom, where the shower\/bathtub and sink are, were not working. We called the front desk and it took them almost an hour for someone to come to our room. By that time my husband had already messed around with them and fixed the issue. Right after they left the toilet started making a loud noise. Almost felt like it was going to explode lol, thankfully it stopped and didn't have an issue with anything else after that. 
One more thing is the Tran. I'm so thankful for it. I know its Vegas and I was prepared to do a lot of walking. But the Tran was a life saver. It's convenient and took us to the Luxer and Excalibur in no time.",1,0,0

I chose the location because of its closer to t mobile arena and I was attending a concert but come to find out it's really not that close. I don't think I would chose that end of the strip again so that's my personal preference and I probably shouldn't deduct anything from the hotel for that. Besides the usual issues with Vegas such as high resort fees for am amenities you never use (who goes to the gym when you're on vacation? Certainly not me), and the pool is closed and you're barely in your room to use Internet, or that you can't even wake up to make coffee in your room because they want to charge you 4.50 for the coffee and cup I thought the room was huge the bathroom was separate from the sleeping area enough that you felt it was more than just a room.

It was a sub par experience - terrible room, terrible service and overcrowded. 

So, when I found out I was to stay there for a friends' wedding, I was a little nervous but also optimistic that perhaps they'd improved. Arrival and unpacking at registration was fine; however, they always want to take your luggage down into some 'hold', and I do not permit this. Last time they had lost and\/or misplaced luggage, and I didn't want to risk it. So, I waited with the luggage cart (much to the chagrin of the bell desk) while my companion went to check in. 

The check in line was abominable. It was 11am on a Friday morning, and there were 5 'lane's open, each about 10 people deep. It took 30 minutes to check in. Then, I had to wait while they found a bell person to bring our cart upstairs (I was not permitted to take it myself), and that took another 15 minutes. So, from arrival, it took 45 minutes to get into our room.

The room (19th floor) was quite nice with a view of the airport. It was modern and clean - much better than I had remembered. The bathroom was updated and spacious. No complaints with the room except that the TV was difficult to use.

The hotel overall is just a bit discombobulated. So many people working there yet everything seems to take a long time. Even the elevators were backed up with long lines forming to get up to the rooms. I don't know if they need to restructure their staff and\/or hire more people and\/or what, but they are definitely not running a tight ship.

The pool\/beach area is nice, and the wave pool is fun. But, in all honesty, for the price we were paying, I'd expect a lot more given the state of the economy and the super low prices at the other casinos. Unless there is a concrete reason to stay at Mandalay Bay, I probably won't stay there again and will opt for a less expensive casino and\/.or equally expensive with better customer service.",0,0,0

The bathroom also had a separate bath and new, very clean shower cubicle. The room style and facilities were great, no problems and the room service had made it perfect.

Part of the reason we rented this suite was because we were told the room had a great sound system and all we had to do was plug in our iPod and dance the night away. 

When we got to the room there was no iPod cord with the system (which we found weird) so we purchased one from the gift shop downstairs. However, we couldn't get the system to play our iPod. We had several very tech saavy people with us (including a bartender we had hired to make drinks) try to get it working, with no luck. 

We called the front desk THREE TIMES to ask if someone could come up and help us figure it out. We were explicitly told NO. They literally would not send someone up to help us with something we had paid $621 dollars a night for. 

We ended up not using the special playlists my DAD and best friend had made for us to listen to.

We also asked if they could deliver a pack of cards and charge it to the room, to which they rudely said no, as well.

Ok moving on. I get to the elevators and there's a line around the corner for that too. It was about 5 minutes to make it to the elevators.

Finally, on my way out, there was another, fairly long line for checkout, and I need to get a receipt for my expense report.  I was pleased to see that there was a guy who was taking down names and emails for ""Express Checkout"" and he assured me that he would email me my receipt later that day.

It's been 6 days, my expense report is due today and I've received nothing.  So then I called Mandalay Bay this morning and was put on hold for over 15 minutes and eventually gave up.

The restaurants are pretty good and some are reasonable, although after hours there are disappointingly few choices.

Stayed at Mandalay for my first trip to Vegas, and it was a good experience.  Very clean, very nice staff, and loved the spa.  I was excited to try out their beach since it had such good reviews, but we stayed there during the season where all of the pools (except for the year-round heated South Lagoon pool) were closed.  Boo.

If you want to save money - don't buy your sundries at their gift shop - use the Walgreens a little further north up the Strip.

Don't pay for a cab - there is a free tram from Mandalay which connects to Luxor & the Excaliber, ane 2 others that you can take to get around the Strip:  http:\/\/www.vegas.com\/transportation\/monorails.html.  I actually really liked walking the Strip anyway - you get to see all of the famous casinos, and escalators and walkways are at every corner.

I bought a day pass to Mandalay's Spa, & it was totally worth it.  The sunny gym was a nice break from the dark casinos, I could relax in the hot tub or steam room as long as I wanted, and the massage (not included with day pass) MADE the trip.  Added bonus:  If you want to avoid paying for mini bar snacks, there is fresh fruit, trail mix, juice, and bottled water available free to spa guests.  Hey, I told you I was cheap!

Other room notes:
- Wifi available in rooms (I believe it's free)
- Big screen TVs in rooms
- Really nice bathrooms (2 sinks, TV, giant jacuzzi tub, and walled-off toilet)  If you don't want to pay for the spa, you could do a low budget version in your tub & watch TV from there - ha!
- I enjoyed the lounge area in the rooms.  When my bf was away at conference and my legs were too tired explore any more, I hung out and did crosswords here overlooking the Vegas desert.

Shopping & Dining
Most of the shops and restaurants seemed expensive to me, but that's probably all relative to the Strip.   If you are really strapped for cash because you gambled your spending money away, there's a Subway across the street to the east.
- Stood in line for Raffles for breakfast (meh)
- Ate Mexican at Border Grill twice: once for lunch, once for dinner.  If you go for dinner, you can eat on the patio overlooking the pool area - very nice.
- The sushi\/sports bar located in the middle of the restaurant area was a surprise favorite for me.",3,0,0

The rooms were huge. The standard rooms are 550 sq. ft., enough room to walk and store luggage. They have decent size closet space.

Fine, I should be thankful and I am, but at least package it right especially that I paid for the shipping or provide insurance.

Good resort. Great Operation and very well organized that they could find my iPad and send it to me. I had to deduct some stars on not finishing the job well. Maybe it's USPS' fault, but I can't complain to them. (3.5 is more of a fair rating, but Yelp won't let me)

To our disappointment, you have to be 4 feet tall to go in the wave pool, which is the main attraction. And while I envisioned my kid being able to play in the sand, there was no real practical place for that to happen, even if the sand weren't full of cigarette butts. They don't rent tubes for the lazy river- you have to buy them for $20+, as if you are dying to deflate that and stick it in your luggage.
There isn't much shade at the pool, the ground will burn your feet, and on the day we were there the whole pool area was so crowded that I couldn't escape soon enough.
The casino didn't have any pleasant places to walk around inside. Typical dark and smoky sadness. 
Our room was nice, with a good view and climate control. The bathroom, especially the big separate tub, was luxurious.

So really this Hotel is nicer and less tacky (its only the big giant gold one) than many of the other hotels on or close to the strip. The Casino looks like all the other newer Casinos on the strip. Its filled with a wide selection of restaurants, all of which are like all the other hotel restaurants on the strip. 

Border Grill- 3 tacos - $18, Corona $8 - Average mex-american
Noodle Bowl- $19 Pad Thai - Not good Thai, PF Changs.... 

The Rooms are nice and you can actually stay for a decent price. The will even bring you up a bottle of Patron for you for $350. I live in oregon the liquor tax here is out of control, so I can safely say that is the most blatant attempt at rape I have ever seen. Ohh yeah, Vegas, I should expect it....  The bed in my room was great, bathroom was nice and bonus for the 52inch TV's in the rooms. 

This is a decent place to stay on Las Vegas BLVD, but you need to understand where you are. The Lobby and front desk were almost always packed. The only time i could walk right up is when I lost my key at 4am. The Pool area is cool looking but much like the lobby is always packed and it closed around 6pm. Blah, Bay Blah, Blah, all the same hotel stuff. 

If you want to be in the mix of things stay someplace else. Mandalay is at the VERY end of the strip so if you want to walk someplace different you will be walking a while. 

So if your taking a weekend to act like your a dead-man on Monday you could do a lot worse. Eat outside the Hotel, be ready to catch a cab, working girls seem to scout outside the Luxor, and there is a Liquor store across the blvd.

The rooms aren't elite opulence, but they are nice with functional, yet cozy furniture and large bathrooms. If you can afford it, be sure to upgrade to one of the upper floors because the views of the Las Vegas Strip are better from there. Since Mandalay Bay is currently near the South end of the Strip, rooms with a view facing north\/east will be the best. The location is also really close to the airport and 15 freeway.

I had to stay with the car while my friend went to check on. Finally i was able to join her and arrived at the front desk in time to hear the receptionist say that they had nothing available at this time which was around 12:15.  We booked the room weeks earlier and had requested an early check in which is suppose to be at 10AM, so imagine our shock when the only solution given was to check into a penthouse at the regular Mandalay Bay hotel for an extra $100 a night. As tempting as that offer was we  wanted to stay at THE Hotel. So magically there was a room available and we went up to the room to find a view of the ever beautiful parking lot. Now when we booked the room we made it clear that we wanted a Strip view because coming from the desert we don't want to stare at more desert. Upon booking we were assured that we would have a strip view.

My friend asked to speak to someone regarding changing our reservations to another hotel, soon after we were moved over to the strip side. 
Now once in our new room my friend called to ask the original receptionist she spoke with why she had stated that there was no way of changing rooms. However she was placed on hold to wait for her. Now when the receptionist got on the phone she immediately started speaking Spanish. now my friend has a Latin based last name but does not speak Spanish. Needless to say we were shocked by this behavior and assumption. I am happy that there are bilingual employees there to offer proper communication for guest, however, assuming someone speaks a language based simply on a last name is very inappropriate and unprofessional. After speaking to a supervisor about the entire experience , Chad offered a food and beverage credit. This was kind, but not the point. 
The next day we decided to go the the Bathhouse spa for a few hours. The ladies at the front desk were kind and polite. the problem we that the water at the spa began eating away at my brand new  swimsuit. I rinsed it off and continued my experience nude. Their towels were not big enough to accommodate my chest size, but i wanted to relax so i went about my private bath. Upon finishing my bath i went into the women""s locker room to shower. I saw a machine that instructs you to place your swimsuit in to prevent chlorine damage. Now this is suppose to ring out excess water, so i re-rinsed my still melting swimsuit and place it in the machine cup side down. I pressed down and the machine began shaking uncontrollably. So i release it and remove my swimsuit as instructed only to find it tore beyond repair. I* was so shocked i couldn't speak. My friend asked to speak to a manager and A woman came in asking if there was a problem.  Now i informed her that the spa began melting my swimsuit just minutes after entering the water and she stated, "" I wouldn't know about that. I don't swim here."" WHAT?!?!?  When i told her that there should be a warning about under-wired tops or something because this is crazy, the only thing she said was that i could talk to security.  She was already walking away when she explained i could file a lost or damaged item report. She never apologized. I never asked for compensation. I was just wanting to let her know what was happening at her spa and i was was treated with nothing but a ""whatever"" attitude. She never even introduced herself. We had to ask her name.
I ended up filing the report with a very kind security officer and low-balled the price of my suit because this wasn't about the money. This was about customer service. even the day we left we had the valet bring the car around and instead of helping me with my 3 large bags he stood by the trunk. i couldn't believe it when he actually tried to reach inside my trunk after i had already placed the bags in there. I guess he thought he was going to help... after not helping. 

the bad luck continued when i found out i had left my seizure medication there... Just shoot me. I got passed around to 5 different people until security went to the room and found my medication. Now i arranged for fedex to overnight my medication at my expense (i left it so no problem) and an email confirmation was suppose to be sent. Never received it, called to check the status and it was picked up and an email was suppose to be resent...Still waiting for that email. the customer service was deplorable. It seems like THE Hotel doesn't need to make a good first impression. Save your money.",6,4,0

First time in Vegas, didn't really know where to stay - but Mandalay offered us a suite upgrade for the second night & who can say no to that. First off the front desk service at check-in was excellent. Everyone was very nice and accomodating, we arrived in Vegas at 10am and they had a room ready for us even though check in wasn't until late afternoon. The size of our room the first night was good, it slept my husband & myself plus my 3 cousins who didn't make it to their room that night. The suite upgrade room was even bigger, with a view overlooking the strip. All in all we had a pretty good stay. The hotel can be a bit confusing though, its pretty big and there aren't very many signs that tell you where to go. It was a mystery looking for the elevator entrance to take us to our room upon arrival. Also, gift shop was expensive for the late night munchies, so we stocked up at the Walgreens down the street.

I still had to pay for $4 coffee just to wake up enough to walk to Starbucks, though.  That made me sad.

I'd never been to Vegas before, and this hotel was a decent ""first time"" experience. From what I'd saw, Mandalay Bay is definitely nicer and cleaner than some of the nearby hotels. The casino is huge (well, this is Vegas after all) and there are a lot of restaurant options. 

Plus:
The Shark Reef is at Mandalay Bay. They have the second largest sharks I've seen in an aquarium, second only to the Maui Ocean Center (but there are a lot more of them)
The room was clean, and the bathroom was huge and awesome!
Tons of pools, including the ""beach""

Minus:
This is at the far end of the strip, so bring good shoes or lots of extra cab fare
The pools, while plentiful, are super crowded
My biggest complaint: The $18 a day resort fee. I scanned a few of these reviews before complaining about it to make sure I am not the only one that thinks it's bogus. They tack it on your bill at the end of the stay instead of just including it in your nightly cost. So what happens is you think you are getting a good deal compared to some of the other nearby hotels, and then they add an extra cost at the end of your stay. Pretty shady if you ask me.

All in all, I would probably stay here again. At least I wouldn't be surprised by the resort fee the second time.",0,0,0

The experience we had then was fantastic and truly unforgettable. Not this time. The first thing I noticed was how commercialized they had become. It was all about the numbers and turnover. The check in kiosk worked out well. The room was beautiful. My problem was the there was no personal touch, that make-you-feel-special way they had before. Now you're just a number.
I made an error in my reservation and booked 2 nights instead of 3 nights as I had planned. Yes. That was my fault, not theirs. Without calling me, they locked me out of the room. When I went to the reception, the last there said there's nothing she could do, we should take our things out as soon as possible. I asked if we could pay for one more night, she said no. All their 3000+ rooms were booked. Okay, I understand, could you help me out, since I'm an M Life member, maybe help me get a room in any one of your other hotels?... No.

The wave pool, lagoons, and lazy river are great. Don't being more than a room key when visiting the beach area because I have encountered and seen many security issues there.

The front desk is not reactive to customer concerns. It takes patience while dealing with them or they will spoil your vacation.

The Rum Jungle club downstairs keeps you rocking into the wee-hours of the morning.   I have to be honest, though, I'd probably give the whole place 1 star if it hadn't been for the fact that, it being my Bachelor Party, I didn't have to shell out too much money during the weekend.

The pool's a total joke.   If you're going to charge hundreds of dollars for a room, you have to provide adequate numbers of chairs for the pool.   We had to resort to putting our stuff next to the edge of the pool and just staying in the water the whole time.   Poolside service was nonexistant.   Now of course they have the Moorea Beach Club, which charges admission.... Fricken' $50 per guy, no less.... So we ask the guy at the door if there are any chairs available:  ""I dunno,"" he replies cooly.   ""Well,"" we said, ""Can one of us at least go and take a peek to see if you have seating for the five of us?""   ""Nope,"" he replies.   ""So let me get this straight,"" my best man asked, ""We have to pay $250 just to find out whether or not we can get chairs in there?""  ""Yup.""   Clearly, Mr. Doorman's vocabulary was as extensive as our President's.   I'm secretely hoping that the buffoon gets a bad case of skin cancer (he seemed to be well on his way, anyhow) in the near future for treating hotel guests so rudely.

One might say all hotels are like that, but having been at the Paris Paris, I can tell you with certainty that I got a comparable (not quite as nice) room for $129\/night at Paris and there was PLENTY of seating around the pool.

Gambling here was fun... but either I'm really cheap or I just think that this place was not even worth close to what it cost...

The good -- the room, lobby, hotel were GORGEOUS.  Bed was comfy.  Bathroom was spacious and well laid out with the tub separate from shower.  Staff was friendly.  I liked the decor.  The INITIAL charge for the room itself was very reasonable for such a nice place.

The resort -- this is where it gets hard.  The idea is great -- the facility is fabulous, but it was hard to relax and have fun -- here's why -- wave pool\/beach.  There was sand, but it was packed with chairs so tight, like sardines.  There was not ""sand on the beach"" it was contained to the tightly packed chair area.  The wave pool had very limited waves, and every time you would try to relax, a life guard would come tell you that you were ""doing it wrong"", like you are not aloud to sit down, although the air is chilly between the waves that are minutes apart, and there are not enough life guards for the deep end.  Concern for safety diluted the experience so it really wasn't fun.  We then tried the Lazy River -- they have you for $22 a tube -- you CANNOT rent, only buy, even though no one wants to try to dry out, deflate, and roll up the tube and take in on the plane when you are done.  Pass.  We settled for walking through the lazy river.  Then we tried to order a drink.  You can't charge it to your room, without ID, and I didn't see any lockers to stow ID in.  We had to bring our debit card AND ID, and take turns watching it.  Management -- see Great Wolf Lodge where guests can wear wrist bands that are room keys, and can charge, and water proof -- far less stressful for the guests.  THEN, as we were a couple there for our anniversary, we decided to get out of the kiddy area and go to the special adult area -- I guess the main attraction is ladies can go topless if desired.  I assume not ladies like me, showing off 20 years after anyone would want to see......Whatever.  We were hoping for less action, and a very modest amount of privacy.  We get to this beach, and it is a $30 cover charge, for my husband only.  This is super creepy -- were the men supposed to be paying to see ladies with their tops off?  Kind of treats the female guests like free prostitutes for the hotel, instead of just adults that want to sunbathe with their top off.  I looked around, and trust me, the experience was not worth $30, it was similar to the rest of the pools, so we left, plus you had to pay extra for decent seating.

Everything costs a little extra, even for a resort.  I could never completely relax.  I was never sure when I was doing something that would cost us money.  Little things, like tiny packets of 4 Motrin pills at the gift shop didn't have a price on them, and turned out to cost about $6.  Places like the pool and the foundation room made a killing on basic seating -- hey if you want to sit in a comfortable chair, pay $30.  You would not figure this out until you got somewhere.  Oh, and there is the typical hotel overpriced mini fridge, and treat basket in your room, but you CANNOT TOUCH THESE ITEMS or move them around, because there is a weight sensor that will charge you money.  Don't try to put anything in the fridge or move items.  It made me feel mildly tense by the time I left, and although I had a great time, glad to get out of there with what remained of my wallet.  I may return, although I will plan much better, like by $3 tubes from the Goodwill, and discard or gift them instead of repacking.  And pack my own Motrin.  And have a drink before we go swimming, and not try to buy anything there.",6,3,1

The property is beautiful with lots of trees and water. They do a good job of creating a tropical oasis in the middle of the desert. 

The room was ok. We had a great view of the strip, with a floor to ceiling window, and the room was very large. The soak tub and the shower were nice. The furniture was a little worn and the bed felt flimsy. They also could have nicer linens. The sinks seemed to have leaks and dripped a lot at random times. Also, the temperature controls were weird.

I think that Mandalay bay is one of the bigger, more difficult hotels to navigate on the strip. All of the elevators are crammed into a little hallway area so during the busy times it's just a sea of people all trying to fit into a small space.  Everything else is so spread out so it seems silly to have that all be so poorly designed. The shark reef was ok but like a lot of things, it was very out of the way. Seemed like it was on the other side of the property and even if you're staying there it's a long walk. 

If there is one reason I would stay there again it would be the pool. The beach and wave pool area are the best in Vegas and you can't beat all the different options for swimming, relaxing, lounging. Shade is definitely costly though, so if you're cheap, be prepared to sit in the sun and burn! We broke down and bought two cushioned chairs and an umbrella because it was just too hot in the sun! It came with free water and free access to the Moorea beach area, so I think it was worth it.

Been coming here for years and have never had a bad experience until now.  I can't give the resort a 1 star as I know where they've been long term and hope they turn things around soon.  

I Booked a Two Bedroom Panoramic Suite and was expecting nothing but the best as I have been accustomed to for more than a decade!

The check in process was a pain.  Checked in to the front desk only to be told that my room wasn't ready and to expect a call near 3pm.  This was 1:30pm.  Came back after 3pm as I didn't get a text or call as promised. Waited another 30 minutes as the front desk associate was trying to find out why my room wasn't ready. Eventually by 4pm I was given my room keys and was able to get access to my suite.

Apparently, they had to switch floors to accommodate my room type, which was specific upon booking the reservation. 

The suite has double doors, which would have been great if one didn't need to be adjusted as it was very hard to open and close.  Maybe replace the hinge before other guests check in. 

The room was spacious and clean, so I'll give the cleaning crew a nod for a great job... 

What's worse, is at 7:30pm, I received the phone call from the front desk notifying me that my room was now available to check-in! This was the call that I was suppose to receive at 3pm! Obviously something is wrong with their computer system or front desk staff...  Very frustrating and upsetting. 

The Wifi didn't work in the rooms and the TVs, though huge kept dropping signal.  

Also, the light in one of the bathrooms didn't work.  I requested to have it replaced the first night but even upon check out, it hadn't been fixed.

The $40 per day resort fee, includes Wifi and access to the POOL that was not open- should not be charged to guests. Since parking is also charged.  Parking is reasonable but check your room bill upon checking out!  They applied a valet fee for two nights, which I didn't use once!  I parked in the garage the entire visit. To make things worse, they were also trying to charge me for jerky from the mini bar, which we didn't even touch...  Amazing.  

One thing that really irritated me was at 10am, the cleaning crew was already banging on the doors saying we had to be out! Check out time is 11:00am.  I've never had this happen to me, ever out of all my visits to Vegas.  Whether it was at the Wynn, Palazzo or even Caesars. 

Seeing that there have been recent reviews from other guests that haven't been very positive, I'm sad to say it's hard to stay away from a place where I've had so many great moments with friends and family.  I may not return to the Mandalay Bay, Delano or any other MGM Property.

With so many other options on the Strip, you'll probably want to consider looking else where.",14,3,3

Robin (check in staff) said he'd use an updated credit card (my boyfriend wanted to pay for the stay, we were in town for his friend's wedding) for the hotel bill (Robin took the credit card information from my boyfriend, who knows what Robin did with it) we've sense disabled the card
We had to switch rooms due to broken AC (even though this is the newly remodeled tower)
Our new room (same floor & tower) had no hot water, and a broken sink, and kept us up all night by the airport traffic and drunks stumbling out of the elevators. Because as mentioned before, we couldn't have our reservations so we ended up in the 'remolded' tower. 
I asked the staff about the problems many times. I thought for more than $300 a night I deserved hot water. Mandalay Bay removed my resort fees. When I reminded them that I was here for a wedding & not interested in the optional resort fee, they dismissed me.
When I asked for a receipt at check-out staff refused. They can afford to keep up an aquarium in the desert but not print a receipt. 
I called to get a copy of the receipt, customer service refused because I could only reference the first confirmation number not the second number that Robin created. Instead of giving me a receipt they spent 25 minutes on the phone with me and then gave me an updated confirmation number. 
My suggestion: If you book this hotel, keep all of your confirmation numbers.

Mandalay Bay advertises itself as having 8 pools. Don't be fooled by this. If you have kids and you didn't spend their college tuition to upgrade to the beach club or whatever they call it, you are consigned to three pools - the wave pool, the normal pool where you can hang out with other adults and their varicose veins and fading tattoos stretched over lumps of cellulite, and the lazy river, which isn't so lazy when you're trying to doggy paddle inside a tube and you've got one foot stuck up a Chinese guy's ass and the other locked inside the tube of the 12-year-old brat behind you.

And while we're on the subject of tubes, let me make this very clear - BRING YOUR OWN TUBES. This ain't Schlitterbaun. You can't just grab a discarded tube out of the bushes by the Snack Shack. Mandalay Bay has a strict ""nothing in life is free"" policy and nowhere is their business model better practiced than their $22 tubes. And if you've smoked a pack a day since the Challenger exploded, don't worry, they'll blow up your tube for you. They'll do it where you buy tubes, but that line is always long and full of pissed off people being forced to buy $22 rafts, so take my advice and get the guys at the swimsuit shop right at the entrance to do it.

If you're like me and you didn't know the tube price gouging before you got there, take the monorail over to Escalibir and walk across the street to Walgreens. They sell tubes for $5. They're not as big, but they'll do (unless you've been buffet hopping all week and your ass is as big as the wave pool) And while you're there, pick up little bottles of liquor and a bottle of juice or soda and a Vegas souvenir cup and stick them in your beach bag, because the poolside drink prices are just as bad as the tubes.

One more tip about tubes: a lot of times, people leave their tubes when they're checking out. Maids leave the discarded tubes in the hallways while they're cleaning, so be on the lookout.

The good:

Rooms are clean with separate showers and baths. 

The aquarium is totally worth it if you have little ones. 

The buffet is to die for.

The employees are super, super nice.

I will definitely come back...just with my own tubes next time.",10,11,2

Although I have stayed here, both at The Hotel and Mandalay Bay, it was a while ago (over 6 years ago) so I really can't comment on the rooms.  I've been to parties in some of the nicer suites and I would highly recommend it if you've got the money.

That being said, I really enjoy this property and have a lot of fond memories.  The property has a nice design that has lasted the test of time (or the test of time for Las Vegas - aren't things imploded after 12 years here?). 

Mandalay Place seems to be struggling a bit, but it's a great place to get some unique gifts.  Urban Outfitters is easily accessible from the Mandalay Place valet and is a good place to quickly pick up a gag gift for an acquaintance or a friend.  Lush, which sells handmade bath products, is also a pretty cool store. 

I like that the place keeps reinventing itself, with Eye Candy and the dancers on stage above the blackjack tables.  What gives with that anyway?  I've been at the property at 8am for a haircut and the dancers are still going (starting?) and the tables are packed!

It's a nice place to just come and chill out in one of the lounges.  They do a good job with their conventions and the Rock n' Roll Marathon.  The two Starbucks are a nice touch.  My only complaint is that the ticket booths for events don't sell all the tickets to all the shows and seem to close at odd hours.  You have to go to the ticket sales area by the sports book all the time to buy or pick up any tickets, even if the event is on the other side of the property.  But all in all, a great property!",2,0,2

I heard so many good things about this hotel so when I saw a good deal on expedia.com for this hotel I took it right away. I had few problems with them that would make me think twice before I'll stay there again.
We checked-in fine. Problems started the next day. We went for a trip and left a ""do not disturb"" sign on the door. When we returned back, there were no sight outside the door and the room was cleaned. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with them cleaning my room, but it was surprising that they ignored my request. Ok that wasn't a big deal.
Second problem I encountered was when they charged me at checking-out. The deal included 2 buffets per day meaning it has been prepaid by me before I arrived.. Buffets over there are pretty expensive, so when I was charged for 2 of them at check-out I it wasn't something I was happy about. It was over $200. They said that they will resolve the issue, and I will be reimbursed. Well, I got only half not the whole amount they charged me. So, I would have to call them again and try to get the rest of the money somehow. 
And the last problem that finally got me was with the lost and found department. I managed to leave some valuables in the safe of the room I stayed in. I mean I realized it was my mistake, but still expected a little more understanding from them. I called in two hours after I checked-out asking them to go to the room and take my things out of the safe. I was told that someone went right away and I will receive a call back within 30 minutes. After not hearing from them for 4 hours I called again just to hear the same story, the room is still free and someone was on the way to the room. Same I heard the next day and the next day. When I called again on the fourth day I was told that they couldn't go into the room since it was occupied that day and they would have to wait for the people from that room to leave. I was very patient all this time, but when I heard that I finally lost it and told them that I didn't appreciate them lying to me all the time when no one actually did anything. Guess what? They hanged on on me. The bottom line it took them 4 days to recover my items and only after I yelled at them, then they sent the items to me via FedEx and charged me for that of course.  
I believe it would be nice to hear some apologies from them, but I have no hope they would ever do that.",3,0,0

* Price: not bad since it is off the strip. We got $100 per night via priceline when our flight was cancelled. As other hotels in Vegas, they do charge you resort fee, room tax, parkings... 4 star.
* Accommodation: spacious room, view of the strip. Keriq coffee maker in room with $4 per package. Free WiFi. Bathroom supply is generic. There is a wave pool, beach and lazy river for guests. The beach area is OK... Not much of decor and very crowded with many beach chairs!  Make sure you bring your room key to swipe at the baffle or turnstyle gate to the beach area. 3+ star.
* location: close to the airport but faraway from the main strip. There is a tram pick up at the Luxor to MGM. 3 star.
* Motif: room decor is generic. Nice floor to ceiling glass window. Ask for the high floor room so you can get better view of the strip. 3+ star.
* Service: front desk is nice. Check out is very easy via your TV. 3+ star.

Overall, it is about 3.5 star.

We have stayed at the Mandalay over 10 years ago but did not stay there until now. Since the hotel is far from the strip, you have limited option especially for late night dinning. 
The shark reef is pretty cool. Definitely, check it out if you stay here. The wave pool is a cool idea for family with kids but the beach area is too crowded...chairs are packed like sadine!

However there were a couple of things that we noticed that we feel could be improved upon. The cocktail waitresses were very slow at making their rounds. In the past, it seemed that they made their rounds very frequently and were attentive to their customer's needs.  On this most recent trip it appeared that the cocktail waitresses had to cover a much larger area, therefore they couldn't come around as frequently.  We gave a generous trip each time we were served but the cocktail service was less than optimal. Maybe the casinos are trying to save money on alcohol? The casinos have to remain competitive, so one would think they would try hard to earn your loyalty. 
Another thing was that the lifeguards would not allow the guests to swim all the way to the deep end of the wave pool.

We had the offer for a $75 food and beverage credit when we booked the room but I totally forgot all about this up until recently. This was never mentioned during check in, no emails, or additional information was given throughout our stay which would've come in handy since we ended up ordering several times through Postmates instead just to get additional good and beverage delivered to our room. 

Anyways the city view was nice to say the least. Majority of the view is mostly of a construction (for ninja warrior) across the lot but the strip itself was visible enough. The AC takes a while to cool up the room but the cleaning lady was nice enough to clean up after our mess that we gave her a well deserved $20 tip. One of the guys that hails the cabs on the taxi que was also great. He remembered and would always ask about how the previous night at the (whichever) hotel we went to went. Now it may just be because we kept tipping him, or it may just be that he's an awesome dude, but either way, it was much appreciated. 

The hotels location in general was both a good and a bad thing. Cabs always gave us the option to go through the strip or go trough the back which made going between mandalay and our destination much easier. It was just too bad that there weren't any decent nearby food places that was within a quick walking range.

There are plenty of restaurants (although they are all pretty pricey, but hey, it's Vegas.) The pool area was HUGE and fun to relax at. All the staff we interacted with were really nice and it was super convenient that they held our bags on the last day after we checked out. 

I didn't spend any time gambling, but I was happy that the casino didn't smell as strongly of smoke as some of the other casinos. 

Things I would recommend trying at Mandalay Bay:
- Definitely go to the pool. There is a lazy river, a wave pool, a (small) hot tub, and a large normal pool. You can order drinks\/food and there are plenty of places to sit and soak up some sun. 
- The Border Brunch at the Border Grill is expensive but fun. You can have unlimited small plates and I really thought most of them were pretty great. There are more vegetarian options at this restaurant than a lot of the other restaurants we found. 
- I didn't get to go to the aquarium while I was in Vegas, but I heard it's lots of fun. 

When you check out, you can have your bags held for you at the Bell Desk. They will bring them out and load them in a taxi for you when you leave. It's super convenient. You can also use a kiosk in the lobby to check out so you don't have to wait in line (don't forget to leave your key-card!).

Price- Average. 

Service-  Excellent each time I've been here.  

Night clubs\/bar\/restaurants- Been to most of them.  Rum Jungle is still pretty crowded although not the hip place to go anymore.  If you are staying at the Mandalay\/the Hotel, you don't have to wait in the same line as everyone else.  However, you still have to pay the cover.  All the restaurants are great. 

Location-  At the end of the strip.  Cab rides are dirt cheap, trams are free or you can walk the strip.

Casino\/Crowd-  Hardly gamble here.  Tables are expensive and I never win here. Young and old crowd.  Hip especially since most stay at the Hotel now.  I love the layout of the casino though and everything is very easy to find.

Rooms-  Standard rooms are VERY spacious as are the restrooms.    The restrooms are almost as big as some other hotel's room.   Separate room for toilet, standing shower has clear glass door, separate jacuzzi tub, and double sinks.  No one checks your room key at entrance.  Gilchrist and Soames toiletries.

Friends stayed at the Hotel.  Although ultra modern like the W, rooms are quite small and more pricey.  I'd rather stay at the Mandalay.

We had no towels to get ready for our evening dinner reservation and show. I called to complain that the room was not cleaned and I requested towels. After 30 min and three calls we received towels, I informed the housekeeper as well as Guest Services that we had to get ready to leave but I would call on our way out to have the room cleaned. The housekeeper who dropped off the towels picked up the bed linen that I had placed on the floor. so we had no bed linen. I called Guest Services prior to leaving for dinner and requested someone respond to clean the room. I was told someone would be ""right Up"".\/ I also complained about the room not being cleaned and how long it took for us to get towels. I was told that I would be credited one-night ""resort fee"". I felt this was pretty cheap considering the inconvenience, and the fact that we paid an extra $200 for an upgraded room. 

When we returned at 11:30 beat and ready to crash we found the room had not been cleaned and we did not have any bed linens. I had to call and complain again, they said they showed it was cleaned so they would send up the House Keeping manager. I waited for the manager who came and saw that the room was not cleaned and we had no linens. By this time we were really tired and asked that he just send someone to make the bed so we could sleep.

This place is GIGANTIC!!!  Not only was it able to accommodate a conference of about 10,000 with ease, I would say that the majority of the people attending also stayed at the Mandalay Bay.

If you are going to stay here then definitely bring your walking shoes.  My co-worker had a pedometer and we walked at least 10,000 steps a day going to and from the conference - that's freaking 5 miles!!  We did not have much time to explore the rest of Vegas but we more than enjoyed ourselves staying in the resort.

I found this to be a great venue for the conference, but here's a summary:

Rooms - I stayed in the original Mandalay tower and found the rooms to be pretty nice and spacious.  My room had a full size tub in addition to a shower.  However, I would definitely suggest you get a VIEW OF THE STRIP.  I had a ""mountain"" view which was pretty boring.  Also the DELANO TOWER is freaking AMAZING!!!  If you can upgrade to there I would definitely recommend it as it is much more modern and chic.

Gym - The Cardio Center is free but it kind of sucks.  Mandalay spa charges $25 to use the much better weight room but I went to the Delano spa gym which only charged $15.

Restaurants - Between the Shoppes at Mandalay Bay and the multitude of restaurants in the venue there are a GAZILLION choices.  Some of my favorites were Mizua sushi in the casino, Citizens' Kitchen, and the Burger Bar.  I had great meals at all three.

Bars- Again there are a million bars here but we especially enjoyed the Foundation Room and the Mix Lounge.  The views of the strip at both are awesome.

Casino - I'm not a big gambler, but I have to give this casino a thumbs up considering I won $500 in slots and went on a wild positive swing in blackjack.  

Arena - The arena here is MASSIVE.  It's no wonder that Paquiao and other huge events are held here.

- housekeeping (they were amazing and cleaned so well each morning)
- awesome food & beverage promo they offered
- easy\/fast check in
- friendly employees

We didn't care for:
- the location (we love walking everywhere and its just farther from things)
- no one told us only one pool area would be open (it was freezing, but still)

Despite all the things we loved, the distance from everything else is just a deal breaker. There's a tram that can get you to NYNY but it only starts running at 9am and we are kind of early people. So we'd walk as far as Bellagio or Ceasars and back but never made it to the other end of the strip. And the walk from Mandalay to just get to NYNY is boring. Doing that multiple times during our trip got old.",0,0,0

The room seemed decent but room service could be a little better.  I understand hotels cut back on washing towels and everything but they didn't replenish our shampoo and soap until we were almost ready to leave either.  I didn't even have enough of the little toiletries to take home to add to my permanent collection!

The biggest problem that occurred happened at the Delano pool. My wife and I arrived at the line to the main pool entrance at 7:30 in the morning to ensure that we would find a shady spot for the kids. We secured 4 chaises with an umbrella in the middle (at the Delano pool). We left towels, items of clothing, magazines, etc on the chaises, and went to enjoy the lazy river. Upon returning, the umbrella was gone, and one of the chaises had also been removed. After speaking with a supervisor, I was informed that although guests were not allowed to remove personal items nor rearrange any of the furniture, he was unable to help the situation. My expectation would have been a cabana at either a reduced rate or free, since we did everything possible to get the shade that we had wanted, and had gone to considerable lengths to do so. It was explained to me by a cabana services supervisor that the rates were established at $400\/day and could not be lowered to a level that we could afford, even though there were only 4 cabanas in use at the time. Again, every effort should have been made to provide the shade that we worked hard to secure, only to lose by lack of policy enforcement by the staff.

The other incident occurred when my wife went to the burger spot there at the Mandalay Beach area. She used her credit card, and was told it was declined. (The card DID have sufficient funds, as verified by the bank) So she paid in cash, and was checking on the card while waiting for the food. The bank informed her that the transaction went through, and was charged. She asked the cashier for proof that the transaction was voided, and the cashier was not polite. He said there was no way to provide any documentation that the transaction was voided. So my wife basically paid twice for the order! The manager was also not being polite, and was basically inferring that my wife was mistaken when informing them what the bank had said. My wife texted me, I came over, and by then the food was cold, and my wife was crying from the frustration. The manager repeated to me the same thing, that she was unable to provide any evidence that the transaction was ever voided, leaving us to wonder if the $45 we just paid would ever be refunded. I demanded the order to be re-created since the food was cold after the 30 minute ordeal. Not a great feeling to be charged twice, be treated as if we were being dishonest, and to not have been given any proof of the transaction being voided; leaving us $90 out of pocket instead of $45.

It looks like the bank will be receiving a credit from Mandalay back into my wife's account but this took a couple calls on our own time to discover.

Mandalay Bay represents itself as a luxury property with renown customer service. The above incidents simply did nothing to create any feeling of being treated as a valued guest. Rather, we felt as if our concerns were met with resistance and were unresolved, and both situations should never have happened in the first place.

The positives: Our room was large, clean and had two queen beds.Yea...no bed bugs, thank God. Shutter doors close off the bathroom and the toilet is separated from the bathroom. Inside the bathroom, there's a small flat screen tv on an articulating arm readily available for those who enjoy taking bubble baths in the jacuzzi tub. We could not hear the other hotel guests adjacent to us or above\/below (nice thick hotel walls!) We enjoyed the wave pool to cool ourselves off as it was 107 degrees.

The negatives: Ugh...the wait we had to endure at the hotel registration desk. Be prepared to wait 45 min to 1 hour + just to get your room keys! Beware of the hidden fees they don't tell you about: $25\/daily resort fee, and tube purchase ($22 large, $18 small) for the lazy river.  Three margarita cocktails at the Mandalay Bar\/Grill costs $45 (well spirits are not cheap at all in Vegas, really). The Mandalay beach where the wave pool is located is filled with beach lounge chairs and NO umbrellas - you have to pay to use their umbrellas (or lest you suffer under the hot sun).  There was a private party on the first night we arrived and you could hear the DJ's voice resonating (I was on the 20th floor!!!!!!!!)

Overall, this hotel was nice and I'd stay there again if I got that cheap rate. I'm just bothered by all their fees!! A tip for you: If there is a private party in the Beach and you are denied access to the Beach\/wave pool, request a refund of that $25 daily resort fee. They will honor it.",5,0,1

We came to get married here, however the service we requested really sucked, thats why I am giving this place 2 stars only. If this werent for my wedding I wouldnt really care, but the service affected my wedding which really put a bad taste in my mouth with this place...
We were getting married at MB in our suite. We needed our suit\/ dress steamed\/ pressed. I SPECIFICALLY asked for the Bell Desk to call my cell phone, and not the room because I knew I would not be in the room. We needed our order rushed because our wedding was the next morning. When I got back to the room hours after dropping off our order, our phone was ringing. I picked up and the guy said he's been trying to get a hold of me to confirm the order. I asked if he got my note to call my cell phone, he said, 'oh yes, I did see that note'. Ok? So did you ignore my note? So because he got a hold of me hours later than he could have, I had to stay up till 10pm to wait for my order to be done. I again asked SPECIFICALLY to call my cell phone when it was complete so I could pick up our order in person. I didnt want anyone coming into our room while we were not there. We didnt hear anything back so I went down at 9:30 to check the status of our order, they told us it was sent to our room. I asked them if they got my request to call my cell phone since I didnt want anyone in our room while we were not there. Their response, 'Oh yea we did see that note, sorry'.... this was very disappointing. Where is the trust when we ask specifically to call our cell phones twice!?! And they even acknowledged it both times that they ignored our note. 
The house cleaning service really pissed me off during our stay. Let me start by saying the people who cleaned were super nice, however the communication to get the room cleaned at a certain hour was horrible.We had 2 wedding services during our stay, an Indian ceremony with my family at 10am, and a minister service (the official one) at 2pm. I specifically asked for our room to be cleaned at 8am so we could have the room all set by 10 for our service. I confirmed 3 times... 3 different times! We scheduled our morning based off this request, we left at 7:50 and got back to the room at 9:30 to get ready. Our room was not touched, I immediately called the front desk and complained, this was unacceptable. I was getting married in a messy room, after I specifically asked and confirmed 3 times. I started crying on the phone, I didnt know what to do. Its not fair that my family was organized and based our morning off the room cleaning service, and they didnt follow through. So now my pictures for the morning service have a messy hotel back round. Thank you MB, you ruined my wedding pictures and I am VERY disappointed. When I spoke to them on the phone at 9:30 they said they would send someone up, and I said no because we are getting ready and starting our service soon, I had no other option but to continue in a messy room. It was embarrassing to get married in a room that looked messy like that. I asked them to come at 11:30 SHARP to get the room cleaned for the 2pm service, they came late... They had to clean while I was getting my dress, hair and make up done. This is not how I expected to get ready for my wedding. I was so disappointed and sad about this
After all the money we put into this place, after all the time and effort I put into organizing and making sure everything was all set, MB messed up and I had to pay for it. Even my husband who barely complains about anything mentioned to me how bad their service was, and that's a lot coming from him.",1,3,0

I have stayed here numerous times whether it's been at the Hotel or a 1700 sq foot suite last year during Labor Day weekend at the Mandalay itself. I made a reservation for Memorial Day weekend and this time I am with my family and kids and they absolutely love it. The cabanas were priced right and the hospitality is spot on at the hotel itself.

I forget to mention that the maintenance guy told us that he warned the hotel not to let anyone stay in two of the rooms on the third floor because there were plumbing issues, and they did anyway. They assigned US to one of those two rooms he warned them about.

I finally was able to speak to the manager, who was extremely rude, unhelpful and unprofessional. I took photos of all the issues we had in our room, and before I could even being to explain the whole situation to her or show her the photos, she cut me off and rolled her eyes at me. I wanted to let her know what an inconvenience it was to not be able to shower. Imagine flying in to Vegas for a vacation, getting to you room and finding out there is basically NO water in any outlet. 

Unfortunately none of our concerns were heard or addressed. The manager, Ashley, said--and I quote--""I think a $75 credit and a resort fee is MORE than enough compensation.""


Really Ashley? So if you spent over $300 a night to stay at a hotel, and these were the conditions you had to deal with, you would think this is fair? Okay. 

When we FINALLY were able to switch rooms, our bags were still inside our old room because they didn't tell us what time a new room would available. The front desk guy told us he'd make us a one-time-use key to get back into our old rooms and grab our things. I also asked him about the $75 credit we were supposedly getting. He looked at our bill and told us we spent $29 of it already. How is that possible when we didn't buy anything except a water bottle. Is the water $29?! I asked him to look again and he said that he wasn't sure why it showed us being charged $29, when the list of charges says we should've only been charged $5.


FINALLY, when we went back to our old room, the key he gave us didn't work. We called the desk to let them know, and they said they would send security up. We waited for 20 minutes, and he finally showed up. Once he did, it took another 20 minutes for him to verify our information. He claimed that there might be someone staying in there. HOW is this possible, when were not even assigned a new room yet. All of our things were in there, yet the hotel is allowed to let a new guest stay in there before even giving us a new room!?

So let's recap:

-Bath tub had no running water
-Shower only had dripping water
-Sinks also had dripping water
-Bath tub had sand in it and was filthy
-Fridge wouldn't open
-40 minutes for us to be allowed to retrieve our luggage from our old room
-Hotel apparently assigns new guests to a room before the old guests even check out of it
-Charged $29 for a water bottle
-Extremely rude front desk staff",14,7,5

We are locals, and we enjoy being able to come and have a drink and a bite to eat on date night. We love the convenient location of Mandalay Bay as well. It is not located too deep into the strip.  I wish that I could say that I also enjoyed staying at the hotel, but that has not been the case...

We booked an overnight stay with extended checkout (3pm instead of 11)from July 31st-August 1st for me, my husband, and our two little girls. When I went downstairs to the gym this morning, My keycard did not work. I had to follow another guest in to complete my workout. I passed it off as a glitch until we attempted to enter our room again. We were locked out, and after calling the front desk and holding for several minutes, we were told they would send more keys up. Apparently they had deactivated our card at the normal checkout time despite our having extended time. My three-year-old chose that time to inform us that she needed to use the restroom ""really badly."" Luckily I saw a maid getting off of the elevator and I attempted to flag her down. She actually ignored me at first and tried to pick up her pace! I ran after her, and when she (Imelda) finally stopped, she was very rude. I told her my three year old needed to use the bathroom and needed to be let into the room. She refused to let us in the room, she implied that I was lying about a person being on their way to bring us new keys, and was holding back a smile and smirking the entire time I was basically begging her to let my daughter use the batroom. She walked away loudly saying ""call the front, I cannot let you in."" We were on the 24th floor at 11 a.m. (Checkout time) so every elevator was full! They sent security to let us in (my daughter was by then standing with her legs crossed holding her privates to keep from peeing her pants!!!).

We got into the room, and I was fuming. My husband took the girls to the pool while I showered after my workout. I was already upset, so imagine how my anger level rose when I realized there was BLACK MOLD growing in the shower!!!! So now I am livid because I already had to turn a blind eye to the snot wiped all over the bathroom walls when we got into our room. Soooo nasty! That was the last straw. I went and spoke to a manager. They offered nothing but an apology. I asked for nothing but a higher level of service and cleanliness when I spend $300 for one night in a supposedly high-end hotel. I will not be staying at Mandalay Bay again.  I am disappointed in the lack of customer service. I will post my pics of the mold and the snot in the hopes that doing so will move them to action. Clean up your act Mandalay Bay!",11,2,1

First sign we picked the wrong time to come to Vegas. Valet line was over a half and hour long. Everytime we used our car, a half an hour. Should've spent the money on taxi's. 

We got there the day after Christmas and waited over an hour to check in. Not sure why hotels don't have kiosks to check in when you have all your info like at the airports. But, either way. Got to the counter and was told they didn't have adjoning rooms like I had reserved. My children aged 14 and 12 would be on one floor and we would be on another. Humph! I even silliped the kid helping us a few $20's thinking this would help. You know, let him know I was a friend of Ben and perhaps get a nice room. Yeah. No.  Okay. So, another half an hour, forty five minutes and finally rooms are found. They just showed up. They were the handicap rooms so I hope we didn't displace someone who needed the extra space and bars in the shower. 

The rooms, well, they're rooms alright. Ours wasn't that clean when we checked in. The hallways should've have been a give away. My son quickly reminded me, ""Hey mom, what do you expect for $69.00"" I agreed he had a point. But, I would've paid more to be moved away from the laundry room where you could smell the scent of hot grey water and laundry soap. Oh, and it's the kick it spot for the housekeepers in the AM. I thought I had set the clock radio to a spainsh channel and I couldn't find the snooze button. 

Room service...I always say I want to become wealthy and live off room service. But at the Mandaly Bay, I would starve. No matter what time we called or what we ordered the wait was at least an hour and a half. Even to get a pot of coffee. I know, we don't go to Vegas to stay in the room, but I really like to stay some place nice and enjoy being pampered. Just not the feeling I got when I stayed at Mandalay. 

The smell of cigarettes in the elevator and when you disembark in the lobby is really strong. I was surprised. It kinda reminded me of Circus Circus. I know people smoke in the casino and I expect that. But I haven't been in a large hotel where it is so obvious. 

I was trying so hard not the be ""that guest"" that called and complained about everything. I kept telling myself, my room is free, the other room is cheap. Don't complain, just enjoy. And, I had seen a t.v. show about the comments they put in the computer about you when you check in and if you complain. I was afraid I would be scarred for life on the Vegas hotel circut if I made a peep. So I keep my lips sealed. Until now. Thank goodness I can get this off my chest. 

I just want to say Mandalay clean up your act. Please. Such a fine hotel with a great reputation and such a let down all at the same time. Granted I can't afford  the presidential suite or one of your bigger rooms but I still spend my money in your casino's and resturants. And, I deserve to be accomodated and treated like I did. Right? 

So I have decided next time we will stay some place else. I've never been let down at the MGM or the Bellagio. I know I will pay more, but sometimes it's worth it. Take care and Viva Las Vegas.",0,0,0

Had In Room Dining and the food came in the quoted time frame. The club sandwich was very good - it came with a whole plate of seasoned fries. The pizza was just ok - nothing special. I'd say a five on a scale of ten. Buffet was not great but not horrible - slightly above average for the price. There are better buffet options for the same price. The service was very good.

   I tagged along with my boyfriend to Microsoft Management  Summit the week of April 8th.  My stay there was so disappointing I paid extra to get an earlier flight back to Seattle.  The most baffling aspect was the WiFi.  Or lack thereof. Like Indigo mentioned, WiFi there was a joke. They kept losing connectivity entirely.  During an IT conference no less!  Half the time I didn't even have 4G reception for my phone.  When there was connectivity, it was REALLY slow.  You get all of 512mbs included in the resort fee.  If you want to upgrade to 1, it's $14\/day. 
  The room was dated and lame.  We had an awesome view of the airport complete with all of the accompanying air traffic noises.  Beds were meh.  Bathroom was weird.  The toilet itself was located in a tiny room with a door that is always shut and has no fan or ventilation.  Actually no fan in the entire bathroom.  The shower had good pressure but made an awful high pitched noise.  No robes. If  you want a fridge to store personal items,  it's $35\/day.  Otherwise, they charge $50 if you use the one already there.  There was no menu with prices for mini fridge items or the water\/candy sitting on the dresser.  No prices on the spa menu (you have to call the concierge with a specific request).  The air conditioner made a loud squeaking noise.  The windows were filthy with hand (maybe butt?) prints.  The TV was ridiculous.  Crappy picture and fewer channel options than a motel 6.  
  If your'e on any kind of a budget, I would suggest hitting a grocery store before you get to the hotel.  The dining options are all ridiculously over-priced.  Though, in all fairness, that's the case with every place on the Strip. 
  The only overall positive aspect of my stay there was the beach.  The wave pool is great and there are ample chairs.  Beach cafe is reasonably priced in comparison to those in the hotel.  A few cons:  space is really tight between chairs.  6pm seems rather early to close the beach\/pools.  There are only 2 small hot tubs that are filled with children.  It would be nice if there were an adults only area besides the ""toptional"" Moorea Beach Club.  

A few pros:  
Not smoky
Friendly staff
They let me park my rental motorcycle at the Valet area for free
Shark reef aquarium was cool and totally worth the $18

My husband and I came to Vegas to elope when we were 19 (Late 2007). Our naivety was taken advantage of. 

Everything was alright until we ordered room service on our first morning which was a deadly mistake. Eight hours later my husband was beginning to feel sick. We had ordered different things at breakfast and what he had must have been bad. We hung out at the room and went to bed early hoping he'd get better. But, I woke up in the middle of the night to find that my husband was throwing up in the bathroom. He didn't come back to bed. I fell in and out of sleep. In the morning I found that he had spent the night in the shower due to severe uncontrollable diarrhea. He was still throwing up and still had diarrhea. He had gotten bad food poisoning from the room service food and should have gone to the hospital, but we didn't have a lot of money and weren't sure how much an out of state hospital bill would be. 

When he finally showered and made it back to the bed the bathroom was covered in puke. We decided we'd call the maids later when he started to feel a little better. He ended up having uncontrollable diarrhea in the bed so we then had to call the maids. This is where the HORROR get worse. 

When I called I told them we had puke everywhere so they sent their ""puke specialist"" first. When he arrived with his vomit kit he went into the bathroom and then came out and told me there was nothing there to clean. What the hell?? It was COVERED in bright pink chunks. Meanwhile my husband is floating in and out of consciousness on the clean part of the bed. I had to go and point out all the puke to this ""specialist"" even though he was their ""puke expert"". I don't think he understood English. After that he did a very poor job of wiping up SOME of it. I had to call again to get more people to come back. 

Then another woman came in and was OBSCENELY rude to me. I must add that at 19 there wasn't a mean bone in my body and I did nothing to deserve being treated this way. ---She dunked a towel in the TOILET and WIPED it over EVERYTHING in the bathroom!!--- That was how she ""cleaned"". I should have done something, but I was too nice. I just stood in horror watching and taking note of everything she was WIPING TOILET WATER ON. While she did this she harassed me for having a ""drunk"" fiance even though I told her it was food poisoning. When we had arrived at the hotel we were excited to find our fridge fully stocked with alcohol, being just 19 and 20, but we didn't drink much (not religious, just not into drinking). The maid mocked me and sarcastically yelled ""SURE! FOOD POISONING!"". I couldn't believe how rude she was.  I couldn't believe she was ""cleaning"" with toilet water. No wonder he got food poisoning from their breakfast if that's how they clean. I just wanted her to leave. She finally did so I went in the hall and grabbed a mystery unlabeled bottle of something that appeared to be cleaning supplies off of a maid cart and ignored any of them telling me not to. Obviously I was going to have to do this myself. 

I went back in the room and began spraying the solution on everything that she got toilet water on. Then a foreign man showed up to change the sheets. My husband had moved to the bathtub so that they could remove the sheets. The man completely ignored me when I told him there was shit in them. He carelessly flung them around. None of the maids were cleanly about anything. Covered in toilet water and bed shit they used our phone to do their check ins without first washing their hands. THEN the most TRAUMATIC part happened.

My husband was possibly dying in the bathtub and I was alone with the sheet guy waiting for him to get things done and get out. He basically had gotten the bed shit all over himself without notice or care and then came over to me and made sexual advances. He attempted to kiss and grope me!!! I told him to stop and he CONTINUED. I was fearing for my safety and thought I was going to be raped. FINALLY he left after kissing my cheek and hands and just being overwhelmingly TOO CLOSE for comfort. I felt violated. 

I can't believe how generously I tipped EACH ONE of these MORON rapist assholes. I was handing out twenties just wanting the situation to end. 

I will NEVER AGAIN go to Mandalay bay. I will tell everyone to STAY AWAY. I wish I was less naive and did something about this experience at the time. I didn't want anyone to lose their job because I was TOO nice. We did complain to the Mandalay Bay but they didn't care and did absolutely nothing.

The shower was clogged when we arrived, only to be told there were no more available rooms and an engineer would be up to unclog it.

Bathroom was also dirty. How did housekeeping forget to pick up their rags? And yes I know the difference between a towel and a rag. 

Calls to the front desk were a matter of waiting on hold several minutes. This was also the case when the shower clogged again the next day. 

Tram service isn't 24 hours, so please don't be fooled. If you go to see a show at any other hotel, and you leave after 1130pm (like most of the world) be prepared to walk 0.9 miles from the Excalibur to Mandalay Bay. Yes I mapped it, my feet don't appreciate walking a mile home each night. Of course you could take a cab, but, why when the tram is advertised as 24hours a day?

The night before, we were actually staying at another LV hotel, the South Point, which is way off the strip, and we were able to get our room at the Mandalay Bay for a lot cheaper surprisingly! My mom got a great deal for our hotel room on some site online so we were able to opt out of paying for the full price each night. Make sure you shop around online before booking a room to get more bang for your buck.

We had a comfortable stay. Our room was clean, spacious, and very modern. The bathroom was especially lovely considering the gorgeous shower and the hot tub that came with jets! Probably one of the most beautiful and luxurious hotels I've ever experienced. Check-in and check-out was easy peasy.

Mandalay Bay has great service, beautiful rooms, but did I mention the awesome POOLS? ""World Famous Aquatic Playground,"" that's for sure. They have a wavepool, a lazy river, and several different pools that offer cabana rentals and what not. If I remember correctly, there's a total of about 7 pools. All throughout the pool\/resort area are casinos, small restaurants, and little stores for you to purchase things like a swimsuit or sunscreen. 

Another pro is that this place does not get all tourist traffic unlike Caesar's Palace and the Bellagio, so it's definitely more chill and laid back here at the Mandalay Bay, and maybe even cleaner too. 

Mandalay Bay also provides shuttle services to and from the Luxor and Excalibur, which is very convenient especially if you'd rather not walk the whole way because your legs are exhausted from walking the whole entire strip.

It was clean, chic, modern, had a great mini bar, lovely views of the pools and all the amenities a girl could ask for.  It was okay on the price but I felt well worth it considering how nice the pool, rooms, casino, restaurants and proximity.

The pools:  It provides a little bit for everyone.  I'm not big on pools but our group was.  He rented me a cabana and with bottle service, free water and ice bucket it provided a nice haven from the sun.  The wave pool was fun, great for kids and adults alike.  The lazy river was fun though I will say it isn't so lazy and you have to buy your own raft.  Fun none the less and a difference than just lounging the the pool.  

The casino\/dancing: I loved that the casino doesn't try sooo hard.  It's modern, has a fair amount of tables, new, nice dealers and a gun atmosphere.  I found plenty of places to dance with and without cover.  I really enjoyed myself and found plenty to keep entertained at night.

The Aquarium:  I loved it, had such a vairety of fish, mammals and reptiles alike.  There is an amazing part where the main fish tank is like the bottom of a ship.  I really enjoyed looking at the sharks, turtles, fish and assorted sea creatures.  I go to Monterey Bay Aquarium and still really found this enjoyable.

The Restaurants\/Eateries:  You can find good, bad, great, medicore in most places.  Just know what you are looking for, flock where others go, read other Yelp Reviews . . .  and enjoy!

The theme is Asian island tropics and the huge beach\/pool in the back is beautiful complete with cabanas and a lazy river. This hotel also has a very large convention and concert area which looked larger than any other casino on the strip. The rooms are very large and tastefully done with spacious bathrooms and comfortable beds. The staff is friendly and accomodating. The only complaint is there are long lines at the registration desk when checking in and the elevator area gets a bit congested at times. The casino itself is open aired and the dealers are friendly. Skip the underwater reef acquarium. You can find better places to go on the strip for $40. The restaurants inside are an eclectic bunch offering breakfast or dinners in a nice setting. I would highly recommend this spot to stay and with a connection to the Luxor next store, you can stroll through the shopping mall and never leave the property. Plus there is a tram to the Excalibur.

All rooms are suits and we had an excellent one with a view of the strip.  The sitting room has a desk with complimentary wifi, a nice comfy couch (big enough to lay on and get comfortable) while watching TV.  Separate bedroom with a TV.  All rooms have DVD players which is great instead of having to pay for in room movies Dvd players are in the main room, not the bedroom. 1 1\/2 bath.   The room I felt was very reasonably priced.  $100 (minus the AAA discount) so $90 plus $10 tax plus $25 resort fee (and then get this) $3 tax on the resort fee. Which really isn't their  fault I guess it just seemed a little overboard.  So a $90 room is actually $128.00.  If you are going to the pool it is a whole different story.  Wow.  What a rip.  A domestic beer is either 7 or 8 bucks each and pina coladas they sell in a large souvenir cup for $20 but then you get refills for $12 each.  So maybe if a couple of people share a cocktail after a couple of days with the cup it might be worth it.  They have a little convenience store by the pool that sells just about everything but beware, there are no prices marked on anything and believe me the prices are as bad as the beer.  Now on to the ""wave pool""  the Mandalay bay website says they are up to 6 feet.  So my boys ages 11 and 13 were super excited to go.  Well they are more like 1 or 2 foot which makes this the perfect kiddie pool. So crowded they just kept running into kids.  I asked about the 6 ft waves and they said they no longer do that (they need to change their website)  Kids over the age of 14 need their own key to get into the pool.    I also need to mention the price for the reserved chairs.  The day we went (I understand it varies) but on a Wednesday they were $50 each for a front row seat (front row to the wave pool) for the second row they were $25 and the umbrella was an additional $50.  We were lucky enough to find a chair but I can see how at times that would be difficult. And no shade to be found anywhere.    The chairs on the sand are comfortable but the chairs on the concrete are extremely uncomfortable.  So that may be something to think about if you have older family members.  I stayed at the Golden Nugget the first 2 nights of our Vegas trip.  So being there, there are ways to save money.  The buffets, $10 prime rib dinners, the $1.50 hot dogs for the kids at the Fremont.  $2.50 beers at the ABC store.  (bring your own opener)  free entertainment on Fremont street at night. But then to go to the Mandalay and not have any options but the over priced restaurants in their hotel (Lupo is terrific though) They know they kind of have you over a barrel because it is so far from everything.  There is one option.  There is a McDonald's just inside the Luxor that you can get to by crossing through the little mall they have  that links the 2 casinos.   You are not allowed to use the fridge in the room  so maybe bring a cooler and just use their ice.  Bring your own inter tubes they will fill them for you (instead of the $25 for theirs, ridiculous right?)   Try Golden Nugget.  Pool is adult and kid friendly.  Hope that helps someone.",0,0,0

Pros: Super comfortable beds, and very comfortable rooms, deluxe bathrooms, speedy elevators, spa  beautiful,  relaxing and pedicure was excellent, casino not smoky, Bell desk very accomodating and excellent service from staff in general. 

Cons:1)West valet parking garage is extremely difficult to exit, the lack of correct exit signs or incorrect signs caused people to drive in circles or down the wrong way aisle, took 30 minutes to exit due to confusing maze  and only one exit with lots of traffic  once you found it .  This needs to be fixed asap, also signage to find the luggage pick up needs to drastically improved
2) With a $35 resort fee, I do not appreciate being nickel and dimed for everything ie coffeemaker in room but charged for the coffee cup which has coffee in it for one cup only , $20 charge for a pool locker, no rental on pool floats (must buy them), high charge for cabana  $350, another charge to reserve a pool chair and not enough free chairs, high charges on incidentals Example: $11 for a small bottle of excedrin, high prices for spa treatments which were worth it but   you are not allowed to keep things in your spa locker if you want to go outside and use the pool briefly (I asked myself why they would have this policy and I am guessing it is to force you to pay for another $20  locker  at the pool).",0,0,0

Overall, excellent service and hotel setup. Rooms are quiet, modern, have an extensive minibar and are well-appointed with extremely cozy beds and pillows. 

The elevators are conveniently located to the casino and lobby, check-in is smooth with the option for a type of expedited mobile check in, the spa is amazing (only $30 for a day pass to the facilities), and every employee we met was pleasant and eager to assist from the bell desk to the front desk. Bell desk is quick and happy to hold your bag until your flight or until your room is ready, and will promptly bring bags up if you call down for them. Kiosks are available for you to check in to flights or print boarding passes...and they are complimentary for guests, as they should be. Wifi is easy to connect to. 

The beach is a wonderful place to spend some time relaxing (chairs are in real sand!), and there's also a wave pool, lazy river for floating, and several additional pools. The area has a bar and grill and convenient store so you don't even have to venture out for food and drink. I didn't have a problem getting a chair or with towels stacked up in other places unlike some other pools. Cabanas are available to rent.

Casino felt smaller than others, but I liked that it wasn't as smoky, and I don't do much more than slots and blackjack anyway. There are several places with live music at night, a nightclub, and a great rooftop lounge (Foundation Room).

I was worried about the hotel being to far from the Strip, but for a $5 Uber ride, it's worth it. Mandalay has integrated Uber seamlessly into their guest experience with clear signage and a conveniently located pickup spot....unlike other hotels who give taxis priority and want Uber to pick up around the corner. There's also a free tram that drops off between Excalibur and NYNY, or at Luxor.

Can't say enough about how underrated this resort is. Well done, MGM.",4,1,1

I think the hotel is just getting old and needs to be revamped. It is not a bad property but compared to all the newer properties on the strip...

Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino actually shocked me,  I really was not expecting much from the resort, considering its on the other end of the strip and away from the real action.  Mandalay Bay is like the red-headed step-child that you didn't want anyone to know about, but had some type of super power on the low low.  In a world where you have The Cosmopolitan, Wynn, Encore, and The Venetian, Mandalay Bay is a nice spot to lay your head and enjoy what Vegas has to offer.

I stayed here for six days\/five nights in a deluxe room.  Upon the first night I checked in, I was treated very well by the front desk attendant; she provided me with some tips on what nightlife was popping on what days and some of the food spots that were good (in and outside of Mandalay Bay).  Afterwards, I made it to my room.  Upon the initial walk-though, I was satisfied with the size and ambiance.  However, I will say that I thought that the deluxe room at the Vdara was better overall  (same thought even three months after the fact).  I did enjoy the view outside, which overlooked the DAYLIGHT Beach Club, and the other smaller pools.

Each time that I needed to take a cab from Mandalay Bay to a target destination (which was not much), the cab lines moved quickly and no problems arose.  Tip: take the small shuttle that runs regularly to Excalibur if you want to avoid paying for cabs, the shuttle is free.  The shuttle only runs until midnight I believe, so plan accordingly.

Yes, if you're wondering: nearly everything was expensive.  Example - I needed to get a bottle of water from the cafe downstairs near the fitness area.  The water was $5.  Go figure.  Speaking of the fitness area, I came to the fitness area a couple of times during my stay.  The fitness area has mainly fitness bikes, but you'll find two utility benches and various dumbbells.

The check-out process was painless, as I used the check-out card and dropped it off at the check-out bin near the elevators.  There were no lingering problems even days or weeks afterwards (e.g. mysterious credit card charges).  

Overall, I enjoyed the stay at Mandalay Bay.  Would I stay at this resort again? Sure, but I don't think it's on my top list of resorts to stay frequently due to the distance away from the heart of the strip.",3,1,2

When we got there with our luggage in hand we found the lobby filled with probably around 200+ people waiting to check in. the line wrapped around multiple times back and forth and looked much like an airport security check point.  I'm only glad I got there a bit early because I kept track of time it took to go through the line and get to the front desk for check in and it was 90 minutes.  this is not an exaguration and I wish I could post a picture here of the frustrating looks on people's faces. families sprewed about in other places waiting for their designated line person.  over that 90 minutes I watched the end of the line actually build further than when we got there and wrap around to the main hall. it was very unacceptable and the first impression of this hotel ""resort"".  I have stayed in many hotels both on the strip and away from the strip and never run into this.  Then, they had the gull to send a sweet pleasant lady around through the line to hand out a coupon for two drinks at the one bar\/restaurant.  well, me and my wife don't really drink so it didn't really do us any good.  and it hardly would make up for the 90 minute wait even if we did. our time is very valuable and there was no apology or offer to do anything real about this for anyone.  then, the next morning, when I asked if we could check out at noon (which is fairly common practice for many hotels), they insisted I could not and the check out had to be 11:00 am or they were going to charge me a whole nother day charge just for going over one hour. it was a bit of a heavy handed response on their part as it really inconvenienced us and were willing to pay a pro rated hour delay but not a whole nother night. I wont get into what we paid here but it was a lot and just to give an idea, the tax, parking fee, and resort fees alone (not counting the hotel rate) for one night were around $70+.  I could go on with the bad as there are a number of other things but will leave it at that.

the good is the room was very clean and nice with a large bathroom, separate shower and bathtub and two toilets in different places which I thought was great. and this was not a high end room.  there is a lot to do and see on the property but really don't need to stay there for it.

We booked this hotel about 6 months before a lunatic decided to rock Vegas, and not in a good way.

The hotel is beautiful. It has everything you would expect and more. We felt absolutely safe at this gorgeous hotel. We booked a queen suite and we were placed in their Delano building. The room as super spacious and had a living room with an additional bathroom and small bar area. The bathroom was huge and my favorite part. 

I have this thing with hotel bathrooms... I love them. Don't judge me. 

The hotel is easily accessible to a few other hotels. It provided a Starbucks for us in the morning and a pub at 2am for late night drinks and apps.

The Coffee, is part of the Minibar.... $5 bucks if you use a cup.  Water almost $6\/bottle in the store at the elevator lobby.  Dinner at the Noodle Shop... Chinese restaurant - worst food we have in years at high end prices.... Panda Express has better food.

While the room itself was nice and spacious (no more so than an Embassy Suites), the granite on the tub had a sharp corner sticking out near where you enter the shower, needless to say my leg came into contact with this corner and I ended up with a 2"" gash in my leg.  Bleeding quite a bit I went to the lobby and found a guard and filed a report. He gave me a large bandage for my leg.  ( he was very professional about this all).

So the tub wasn't that big deal because I'm capable of washing it out especially since we were in a bit of a time crunch to get to Mother's Day dinner and who knew how long it would take housekeeping. Now the sad thing is once I was getting read to lather soap there was a very noticeable red hair on the supposedly clean towels. This made me realize that you just never know about housekeeping and think about the room turnaround times. The hotel then attempted to come clean the room after we told two people about the dirty experience but when we were trying to leave for dinner.

It is huge with plenty of restaurants, bars, great casino floor, sports book (best in Vegas) and pool (another best in Vegas). The staff was great, the bags were at our room in minutes. We had some dry cleaning that had to go out. We rung up the bell desk and someone was at our door to pick it up in no more then 5 minutes. That night it was hanging my closet. I got married in Vegas so we had the full package. Cocktail party at EyeCandy Sound Lounge, wedding at the Valley of the Falls, reception at Strip Steak. Pretty much perfect. The wedding staff and restaurant managers could not have been nicer to me, my new wife, family and friends. Nothing but accommodating. My wife was not feeling well for a few days leading up to the wedding and the waitress at StripSteak went out of her way to make sure she was ok. Very, very awesome. 

Everything about this place was great. I see people mentioning cost and ""expensive"". Its Vegas people!!!. If your looking for deals and light expense go vacation in St Louis or something. If your going to Vegas....go to freaking Vegas. Stop looking at wallet...just empty it. If I had to find one thing wrong i would say that there are no robes in the rooms. Yeah...thats about it.

And the standard rooms were more than spacious to fit five girls!  The bathroom situations can be a different story but we had no problems.  More recently, I stayed in one of the suites and they are very nice.  I used myvegas rewards to get one night free, but had to pay full price for the other night and the resort fee for both nights.  Honestly, I was very skeptical if this really worked.  It does, when you redeem your points, you'll receive an email with your redemption code and a number to call.  I thought at first I can just enter the code online, but it didn't work and never was given an option to enter the code.  I will tell you the call can be long, but worth getting a free room(s).  Only downside about this is, they don't send you a reservation confirmation on free nights.

When my then-boyfriend and I arrived to Mandalay Bay the check-in line was long.  We arrived around 3:30pm check-in time for everyone.  On top of that, it was right before EDC weekend.  The line did move faster than I expected.  Prior to the trip, my boyfriend wanted to upgrade the room to a suite.  I told him I didn't want to pay extra money for it... I thought the standard room was fine and we got a free room, I didn't want to have to change rooms.  He said he would pay the difference and he really wanted a suite.  I just rolled my eyes and said if you want to.  We got to the front and we  were help by George.  He was very helpful with check-in us in, friendly while he looked up the best deal for us, and providing the upgrade my boyfriend wanted, which cost an extra $100\/night.  We got to the suite and I was amazed at all the space we had and we had a strip view!  And I was glad we did get the upgrade.  Only thing that I didn't like was trying to take pictures of the strip from the room. We were where they have those advertising for the shows at their hotel and the screen just made it difficult to get a clear picture.

For families, it is convenient to things children would want to go to like Excalibur.  It is connected to Luxor and Excalibur so you don't have to walk outside during the summer months.    There are many places to eat.  Mandalay Bay is connected to the Four Seasons Hotel, which also has some fancy places to eat.

The service here was great.  Since for booking to room, we had two different reservations because of the myvegas rewards, we didn't have to go downstairs to check out and check in, it was done automatically.  They have Wi-Fi available in the rooms for up to 4 devices, there was a restricted amount of data that was for free, but I don't how they keep track of that.  

My boyfriend order room service and surprised me with a bottle of champagne and... proposed!  I took off one star because they got my last name wrong, but it does add some humor to the whole story!  I would like to stay again.  Trying to get both nights for free.  (You can use 3 myvegas rewards in a 30 day period).",2,1,3

Check-In time was not impressive, it was a long line on Monday July 7th.  When we finally got to the counter to check-in the staff that was helping us just walk away and didn't tell us where he was going.  After 10mins of waiting, we asked the counter staff next to us if she can help us (her name is Sara) and she did wonderful, professional and friendly job, big kudos to her!  However, we didn't get our rooms for an hour and half after check-in and there were no lounge area to rest after a long drive so it was annoying.  

On the good notes - the rooms were clean, the bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was clean and nice.  The pool was good for the kids.  The staffs around the facility were friendly and helpful!  The restaurants and shops were ok.  The Citizens Restaurant has very good latte and foods were decent.  The casino areas are roomy and high ceiling so you don't smell the smoke at all.  

You can take the tram to Luxor or Excalibur and walk about two or three minutes into the strip where all the nightlight are.

-Near TheHotel which has Mix restaurant with great food and views.
-Really enjoyed lunch at Fleur
-Large room, overlooking all the pools.
-Eyecandy is a fun no cover bar within the casino for good dj music, drinks, dancing and lounge space to sit (for tired feet that have been wearing super high heels).

Cons:
-They charge a lot for chairs and umbrellas, $600\/day on a Saturday. They will not tell you the price of lounge chairs and umbrellas until that morning.
-Sold out of inner tubes to use in river by 11 am. Know that you can bring your own.
-Pool and river water was really cold, in July.
-There is hardly any shade in the pools. Need SPF 50+.
-$50\/person to use adult pool area.
-Too far South to walk to much other than Luxor, but why would anyone do that?

Know:
-We could hear the Adult Pool's music in our room on the 24th floor.
-Pool is entered through a turn style and everyone must have a room key.
-The food near the entrance to the pools is pretty poor - amusement park stuff.

1. Girls weekend, in the summer. I could probably just stop there, but that wouldn't be much of a review. We got into Vegas late and ended up partying late, so by the time we crawled into bed, we were exhausted! However, that didn't stop Cecilia C. from popping out of bed like a freakin jack in the box, ""WHAT THREAD COUNT ARE THESE SHEETS?!"" 
You would think that Mary C. and I would dismiss this absurd outburst and go to bed, but we are much better friends than that, so there we were at 2-4am (it's all kind of a blur) looking for the tag with the thread count. I really don't remember what the count was or if we ever found it, but I know that next time we stay at M.B, Cecilia is bringing her own sheets. For the record, the sheets are stiff, but I think if we would have given Cecilia one more shot before bed, she wouldn't have noticed. 
The room otherwise was very nice. I loved the separate soaking tub and took advantage of it any chance I could. 
Pool! We absolutely LOVED the beach area. We got up about 10 minutes before the beach opened and threw our suits on. We didn't intend on staying all day, but we sure did! We got front row seats to the wave pool and it was amazing. Very relaxing. We took a dip in the lazy river with our over priced tubes and drank our overpriced alcohol. Mary C. and I tried out the Ice bar later that night and had an interesting experience. If Rodrigo still works there and hasn't been picked up by the Circus, you should hang with him, he's a more than sufficient bartender. 

2. Family Time: M.B is a great choice if you're toting some kids around. Why? Well, the kids LOVE the pool, beach, lazy river, aquarium and there are plenty of kid friendly eating options in the hotel. My kids think the room is amazing because they can watch cartoons while they take a bath. 
My only complaint is that while I had my son (who is a toddler) in the shallow section of the pool, the lifeguard kept blowing his whistle insistently at this couple who were about 10 feet from us. They were having sex in the pool. Seriously, quit blowing your whistle and yell at them or something. I really think the hotel could have been sued for as many children that were around when that happened and the life guard let it go entirely too long.

So all in all I would recommend Mandalay Bay for girls weekend or family time, the staff is friendly, helpful and the hotel is clean...except for maybe the pool....",11,11,10

The grounds and common areas are absolutely fabulous - everything is clean, manicured and kept up. The pool area is glorious - I think it's the largest pool in Vegas and has something for everyone including a wave pool and a lazy river.

I've been very, very happy with the rooms I've had. They've generally been very large and full of amenities like decent toiletries, a good hairdryer and great views of the pool. I especially love the bathroom which is bigger than most hotel rooms in NYC. There's a monster shower stall and a separate soaking tub which I made ample use of after long days on the convention floor. In terms of cleanliness, again - top marks (and I am super picky in this regard).

For eating options, MB has a ton of ""celebrity"" chef places like Aureole, Fleur and the Border Grille. Those are all pretty good but skip the Citizens place - it's heinous. If what's in the hotel doesn't grab you it's connected via skywalk to Luxor which has a few other, crappier choices. However the Shops at Mandalay Place house RM Seafood and Burger Bar which are both really good.

The casino is actually one of the nicer ones on the Strip. It's huge and seems to be less smoky and cramped that ones at Caesars and the Bellagio. I've had pretty good luck here too - winning a few hundred bucks on the Amazing Race slot.

The rooms are nice and roomy, but the reason we always book this place is for us to enjoy time in the sun and the pool area which is FABULOUS!  This place gives us time to feel like we are on a tropical vacation, but can walk out of the hotel and be in Vegas.

Another reason why we enjoy this place is because it's at the end of the strip.  I know many people want to be in the middle of everything, but we like to just go to the crowds as we please, not be in the crowds.  It's a bit of a walk anywhere else on the strip, but there are monorails and cabs to take you where you want to go. 

The hotel itself is more on the quiet side compared to the more ""central""  hotels because it's at the end of the strip.  We like it this way.

The lazy river and wave pool were a joke, talk about hundreds of kids like 5-18yos, we saw 2 piles of vomit poolside, not once did we see anyone pick up towels left on chairs, or trash, or beer buckets...no poolside service\/cleaning, so the place looked trashy.  Pool location is terrible with the wind, your stuff is literally blowing everywhere.  The food at the Beach restaurant has to be the worst food ever, honestly disgusting - $17 for a turkey sandwich made from processed turkey on old wheat bread, kid had sliders $13 for 3, stale buns, and meat that was not edible.  We are so disappointed after having eaten some killer meals at Mirage!
Energy, there was not good vibe in the place, it was huge and fairly quiet, kind of depressing.  Lastly, MB was 30% more $$ than Mirage and fell short by at least 2 stars!",0,0,0

The Mandalay Bay is incredibly nice. Everything from the outside in is done to extravagance. If you travel a lot for business like I do, then this hotel will stand out. 

The room itself was quite large...larger than most...as was the bathroom. There's definitely no shortage of space. Be prepared...if you're not near an elevator, you'll have quite the walk. 

The sheer size of the Mandalay Bay is overwhelming. If you're there for a conference, expect your FitBit to get a workout!  You WILL get your steps in every.single.day. 

So, why only 3 stars then?  Having never been to Vegas, I was not prepared for the smoke. You will need to dry clean EVERYTHING when you get home...and I mean EVERYTHING. Even though the rooms are non-smoking, it's Vegas, and apparently, rules aren't always followed there. 

Other Yelpers said checking in took a while, and they're right. Unless you're here frequently, check-in will consume about 30min or more waiting in line and getting your room assignment. 

Vegas is t for everybody, and it clearly wasn't for me. If you don't mind the smoke (ALL the smoke), and you don't mind the wait to check-in, then you'll likely be ok. For me, if ""what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas"" were true, my dry cleaning bill would have been much smaller.",0,0,0

We were so excited when our MLife points allowed a $96.00 per night Spa Suite here in August.  We were dying to go to the pool here and we love all the restaurants so were were pumped.  well...

The room was average--it was very dark due to one small window that overlloed the back of the hotel.  The ""spa"" was just an oversized bathtub with jets.  My hubby and I could not fit comfortably in it together (we are not big people).  The bed was uncomfortable and the a\/c cycled on and off all night and was very noisy.  I didn't sleep for 3 days.  

The pool was OK but it was VERY crowded.  The first night we were there we went to the pool at 5 pm expecting to have about 2 hours but AFTER we went in we were told they were closing early for a special event and we had about 20 minutes.

MB has been one my favorite Vegas hotels, if not the top spot, for many years - just love the place and so when I decided to get married in Vegas, MB was definitely my go to stay.

I booked the Vista Suite 6 months in advance, but when it was time to check in, we were told the room was not available due to 'a pipe burst' and the room was unusable. Although they did upgrade us to the Media Suite, I was pretty upset as the Vista Suite was what we wanted, for layout and location. I find the 'pipe burst' excuse a bunch of hooey - and tell me why was I the one who got bumped? I booked 6 months earlier - couldnt they have bumped someone who booked later? Ok, I got over it, because they gave us a bigger suite and it was my wedding weekend and didnt want to let this bother me.

Once in the room, we discovered there was only one usable frig(besides the one filled with overpriced drinks etc) and it was smaller than most peoples lunch totes - very disappointing. Not only was it tiny, but it didnt work and we lost the few perishables we could fit in it. We called the front desk twice and it was never fixed or repaired in the 5 days we were there.

The suite also lacked cutlery - really? and no glasses in the bar for our guests, we had to PAY a dollar a glass! really? no microwave either - that cost $25 a day! very disappointing MB! And get bigger ice buckets please!!!!

Ok, so I had to get the negative out of the way - it has been bugging me. Lets get to why I love this place- the suite we did get overlooked the beach\/pool and airport(which I love to watch aircraft takeoff\/land, just love it) so that was very relaxing - more to see in my opinion than overlooking the strip.

The bedroom\/bathroom was gorgeous, very comforting and relaxing - LOTS of space. The great thing about the Media Suite was the ability to plug my iPod into the music system within the suite - speakers everywhere, it was awesome! much better than the stereo we brought with us (just in case).

Joe, our bell hop, was great! Thanks Joe!

We reserved a private bungalow at the Mandalay Bay Beach - very expensive and overpriced in my opinion, but it was great to have on a busy weekend and especially in 108 degree weather! The personal service there was excellent.

In unusual fashion, we had two bad restaurant experiences (noted in other reviews) at Borders Grill and the Red,White and Blue restaurants, but Raffles was great.

All in all, I still love this place - especially the Foundation Room if you can get reservations - just a little bummed we had the issues with the suite(s). I will always return to MB, unless things really go south.

Check In- this was my only downer of the trip. I flew in before hubby on New Year's Eve and waited for 25 minutes. After getting to the desk my name wasn't attached to his M life account. Instead of calling him they made me leave the desk and wait for him to add me. That took an extra 25 minutes instead of the clerk talking to my hubby directly.

Otherwise the hotel feels more upscale and luxurious than the others we have visited. A lot of marble, art, and interesting things to view. The place was immaculate and they were always cleaning. The staff was the friendliest we've come across.

The restaurants were wonderful! We ate in most of them and every meal was delicious! If you can't find anything you like in the hotel, there are a ton of restaurants in the shoppes between this hotel and Luxor.

The hotel is located at the end of the strip so prepare to taxi it or there is a free monorail that will take you to the Excalibur. From the Excalibur you can walk over the overpass to the MGM to catch the paid monorail that will take you close to most strip hotels. It's a bit more walking but you will save 15.00 each way in taxi fares and get to see other hotels. 

We will definitely be coming back to Mandalay. The only negative was our room was never super clean after the first visit. Our maid left dirty cleaning cloths on the floor two days in a row and would never take dirty glasses out of the room. This kind of grossed me out but I never complained so it's on me. Definitely give this place a try.",4,1,2

The M-Life players club card is worth getting, even if you don't gamble. Use it there and at all of the MGM owned Vegas hotels when you go out to eat and charge it to the room. This gets you points.

I'm giving Mandalay Bay three stars because my husband's company footed the cost of the room. If this hadn't been the case, I'd give it two stars, solely because it's evident that the operators of MGM Resorts aim to cut costs in every way imaginable and maximize profits by charging for services (like the use of a gym) which would be complimentary at other hotel chains. It just seemed so tacky.
As others have said, they (over) charge you for everything here- $10 for a liter bottle of water, $30 to use an average-at-best gym and $24 for a club sandwich similar to what you could get at Panera for a little more than a third of the price. I wouldn't have minded the prices if the quality of the goods\/services matched the cost but it's obvious that the hotel cuts corners wherever it can. For example the shampoo\/conditioner provided were poor quality (super diluted and also leaves a filmy residue after washing off) and smelled like the boys did when you were in middle school, i.e. like cheap cologne and were the hotel's generic brand. Instead of the single serving size bottles of ketchup\/mustard\/mayo you'd expect to get with your room service sandwich & fries they give you super sized squeeze packs similar to what you'd find at fast food restaurants and also charge an extra 4.95 per person your ordering for.
On the bright side, the housekeeping staff are on point and our room was spotless. On top of that, everyone working at the hotel was incredibly friendly and so helpful- they work hard for their money so even though the hotel gouges you at every chance, tip the employees well if you get the opportunity.

Was given the ""deluxe"" room - and it was far less than that.  Old towels, stains on carpet, and the linens looked and worse yet felt like they were 30 years old. 

Best part? There's see through frosty window between the walk-in hallway and the BATHROOM.  So if someone is getting dressed or in the tub which shares a wall with the window - well you can entice your visitors with a PEEP show while they wait. 

What Einstein thought of that great design?  Overall this was a 0 Stars place.

Very sad.  

Oh, and don't expect to get anywhere easily outside the hotel since it's on the other side a LONG walk from the main\/center of the strip.

From the beginning of our time at Mandalay Bay service was horrible.  Room type not honored.  We were told that our son's room would be booked on the same floor as our Panoramic Suite.  It was several floors below.  Twice we had to have maintenance in our room.  We rented the Vista Suite for our reception celebration.   Not only did they not honor room choice but the room wasn't available until almost 5 PM!!  Considering how much they charge for the room it should of been open no later than 3 PM.  We had already been at the resort several days and when we returned from the wedding ceremony with our guests our keys to the Panoramic Suite didn't work even though we had already been there 2 days and still had 2 nights left in our stay.  So, we had to leave our party guests in the hallway as we went to the front desk.  Management at the desk is a total joke!!!!  We were there for a half hour and asked stupid questions like are you sure you are in that room.  They showed us in another room.  Well, we have been in the room we are telling you for the last 2 days so PRETTY sure our stuff is in that room.  After several more ridiculous interactions we were given keys to the room we were in!!!  Our daughter and her husband stayed the evening in the Vista Suite as newlyweds only to have housekeeping knocking on their door before 9 AM.  So, check us in late and ask when we are leaving way before checkout.  The biggest salt in the wound was we accidently left a bag on the chair in the Panoramic Suite when we left.  We all know exactly where and what was in it.  A custom cutting board that was a gift, a child's potty chair, a restaurant gift card\/card.  Filed a claim immediately when we realized which was the same day as checkout.  Of course, as expected, they couldn't find it.  It was sitting on the chair in the living area of our room.  So, on top of everything, housekeeping has thieves.   The whole situation had our daughter in tears at a time when she should have been ecstatic.  Not to mention how disappointing to us as parents since we planned the 4-day event months in advance.  We visit Vegas often and this is by far the worst experience.  Management could have cared less what we were experiencing.  We will never, ever, set foot on the property and will tell everyone that will listen to choose another property while in Vegas.

At the front desk, Molly was terrific and explained everything clearly pointing out our floor and room number and how many things worked in the room and the hotel.  She was extremely friendly and professional!   I started off my stay with her customer service being a big plus.  Funny how each hotel has its unique scent.  The room was clean with separate see through shower and a big tub with two vanity sinks.  The toilet is also a separate door.  It was clean and housekeeping did a thorough job of cleaning our room everyday within an hour or so.  The housekeeping will even greet you when they see you walk by.  Very clean and professional establishment.  

The pool area was nice and cleaned throughout the time we were there with staff constantly mopping the restrooms and sweeping the sand in the ground walkways.  They have lifeguards on duty at every pool (wave pool at the man-made beach, lounge on a tube down a river like ride, and two separate other pools).  Nice clean restaurants at the pool area as well.  

The spa was very nice and the massage my husband received was very good compared to some he has visited elsewhere.  

This is the part where I got so angry at times and the biggest complaint I have regarding my stay.  The hotel was doing something to the room above us (we were on the 10th floor 234) and the noise was more than irritating that we had so many sleepless nights with extreme difficulty staying asleep even though coming back at 3am on one night.  The hammering and moving of things was being heard all day (for us we went back to the room to rest often) and could not rest with the loud noise of them fixing or remodeling which is the reason for the three stars.  We paid for the reputation of this resort hotel in which we could hardly get any rest.  If it was not for the constant noise of furniture moving and hammering during our entire stay, as well as, the buffet experience (in another review) then I would have given it five stars.  I hope they will do something about these especially considering the hotel guest staying when it comes to the noise (when the guest do sleep) and the service in their buffet.  I cannot 100% say that it was worth how much I spend to have a nice, clean, and restful experience at all.  I was so irritated with not being able to enjoy and relax as I wanted when I was at our room.

I have read some similar reviews and complaints,  and I hope they at least offer some incentive for the guest to come back as I saw some paid 300-400 per night.",0,0,0

I would describe this place as a casino for responsible adults and well suited and designed for families and keeping kids off the casino floor. Wave Pool is a must. Pool area does have some boozers around, so be ready to deal with a few drunks now and again.

Here are some savings tips.
#1...if you have a family, get a double queen and register one adult and one kid at checkin.  They have a silly policy of charging $35\/additional person past two people in a room.  The check in area is huge, so just have your family sit down in the middle and save yourself a bogus fee.
#2...for the Lazy River, buy an inner tube at CVS, but make sure it is a round inner tube, not a Shamu or animal floaty.  Those won't be allowed.  The hotel inner tubes are $25\/each.  At CVS, it's $10
#3...Breakfast at the Ri Ra Pub in the hotel is hearty and good and only $10-$11\/per person.
#4...Dad's...at the pool, hit up the IPA cart for good beer.  Avoid the waitresses serving domestics.  
#5...buy bottled water at the CVS along with sun block.  bottled waters at the pool are $7\/each.
#6...self parking is easy.  Park on level 5 or higher to find open spots near the hotel entrance.
#7...Try Burger Bar restaurant with some friends.  Great burgers and drinks.",8,1,0

For the wave pool you need to meet a certain hight requirement. I believe it is around 48 inches but don't quote me on that. I know my kindergarten son does not meet it yet, but my ten year old has for a few years. 

The lazy river is great because you can bring your own tube. Don't try to bring a huge lounge float. That just isn't going to pass. If you buy a tube they are about 20 dollars.

However on my last stay here I noticed the following things that made me disappointed and\/or to shake my head in pure wonderment:
* There was mold in the shower on the ceiling and on the caulking
* There was lipstick on the pillow shams, confirms that they werent changed and washed! Which I always figure is the case... who knows what else is on those things...
* The no hat policy for the regular bars in the casino proper??? Seriously WTF... but flip flops and t shirts are ok? I mean can we at least have a sensical dress code here. You can go hang out while wearing flipflops and dance even while wearing basically anything but a hat. 

I ABSOLUTELY HATE THE NO HAT THING. I am a hat guy. I love wearing hats. If someone wants to wear a hat in a bar after 7pm when they are buying drinks why forse him to take off the hat? Is ""hat hair"" really so much ""KLASSIER""? I dont think so in the slightest.

Some other observations:
* There are options for both free and paid wi-fi
* Great amenities like the Shark Reef, Wave Pool, Lazy River, etc
* Most of the table games have higher than average limits for the strip
* Lots of great free parking =D
* Its a great venue for concerts where even the back seats have a decent view of the stage and you can hear everything quite well.

The beds were comfortable and not overly soft as many hotels can be. The towels were fresh and that made me quite happy. Nothing worse than getting stained towels or ones with pubes hanging out in them...

As my last trip was a work related trip, I found that I was comfortable working at the desk and was able to spend a few hours there completely a bunch of photo editing without issue before heading down to play in the casino next door. =)

Well, I don't know if it's the economy or what, but ladies and gentlemen, this is the new Excalibur. The casino is still nice. The pool is ok, but everything else has gone in the shitter.

If I wanted this bullshit hassle I would stay somewhere else, which is what I'll do in the future.

We get to our room and it's larger than a regular room, but not a suite.  But it's seems really dark and it oddly shaped, kind of like a kidney bean but with sharp angles.  One wall had drapes all across it so I open the drapes.  NO WINDOW!!  But I do see a very small window, probably the size of a small doorway, off to the very corner of the room in an area about as big as a closet. (I'm not exaggerating.)  And the view was a rooftop and the side of a building. I added pics.  It was dark and dreary, and I felt like we were in a dungeon. Don't believe me; check out the room, #04-302.  I'm sure it was recently remodeled.  It was probably a storage room before it was converted to a room.  I can't imagine that any nice hotel such as the Mandalay Bay would actually build a room with no windows.

I left 1 diamond earring once and it was found and returned to me asap.  I call the hotel's Lost and Found 20 minutes after we left the hotel, and I'm assured someone will be sent up immediately to look for it.  Six hours and 4 phone calls  later, my book has not been located.  Finally I'm told that the floor supervisor reported the room had been cleaned and no book was found. BS!! I know exactly where I left the book.  So now I'm told I have to contact security and fill out a report so an investigation can be started.  Really?? An investigation? Just send someone up to look in the room. By this time I'm frustrated and take it out on the poor woman in security who has to take my report.  But she was very nice and a Harry Potter fan!  Yes, the book I lost was the 3rd book and it belongs to my daughter who let me borrow it. It's part of a collection that came in a treasure chest.  The woman in security knew the name of the book and exactly what treasure chest I was talking about.  She said she would start the investigation immediately.  Twenty minutes, guess what, they found my book, and exactly where I left it.  The hotel was very nice! And our second room was beautiful.  I would have given the hotel 4 stars if the experience wasn't so awful. Don't think I'll be staying there again.

Being that this stay was on Valentines Day I wanted things to be a little bit special. So I decided to get an upgraded room with a king bed...

So to start when I checked in they had given my king bed away to a convention so, only a room with two queens was available. Pissed but not trying to let it ruin my weekend I accept the room and go about my day. As I walk into my downgraded 2 queen bedroom  the entire room smells like weed and as I set my bags down on the table I notice there's weed crumbs scattered all over the office table. So my natural reaction was to call the front desk to get my room switched again and see if they possibly would have a king available. Low and behold what do you know they magically came up with a king bedroom 3 floors down with a view of the roof. But, before I could switch my room I had to wait 35 minutes for the security guards to show up so that I could give some lame 2 minute statement. The whole situation was a little shady.

Needless to say nothing was rectified and no credits were given to satisfy the customer. I honestly would have switched hotels if it wasn't for Vegas being completely full for Valentines. 

So much for Mandalay ""Loving the Resortist""!!!",8,0,0

This may be my new favorite hotel to stay in Vegas.  We weren't in a fancy room by any stretch, but it certainly sufficed.  The biggest drawback was that we were at the very end of a hallway, and at the end of a long night, that walk seemed longer and longer.  Next time I will ask for closer to the elevator.

The casino is great - spread out, not smoky, the cocktail waitresses are a bit hit or miss, but the good ones are great.  They recognized when service was slow, so they would bring us two drinks to make up for it.  They have great machines that I enjoyed (yay for Organic Craps) and plenty of slot machines for all tastes.

They have tons of food options for all hours, which certainly comes in handy in Vegas.  Plus the tram to get out and part way up the strip really made it easy to get in and out of the hotel.  With easy access to both the tram and taxi service, I never felt the need to stay at the hotel, but there was plenty to do here that we didn't feel the need to go elsewhere.  They do have the Shark Reef, after all.

Add in the House of Blues with great concerts, amazing restaurant options and the beach and pools - this is my new go to.

As for the bathroom in the room - the shower had two settings - scalding hot (which I don't mind) and cold. And when you flushed the toilet, we were convinced it was going to suck one of us in with it - insanely powerful and loud.  Housekeeping took great care of us bringing plenty of extra towels and blankets upon request.

I do wish we had been able to use the fridge in the room for leftovers from all our meals - but it was the minibar and opening it caused charges.  Boo.

Still - I'll stay here again.",2,0,1

I booked this hotel for a quick solo trip. I just wanted something moderately cheap on South Strip. Didn't care what, but I wanted comfort and did not want to stay at the Motel 6 this time soooo I chose a 4 star mystery hotel on Hotwire. 

I ended up with 2 nights (Friday - Sunday) at Mandalay Bay for just over $200 including those pesky taxes and resort fees. While it wasn't my first choice because I was hoping for MGM since their beds are todiefor, I have been very happy with everything so far. 

ARRIVAL
I arrived in the early evening and did self-park because it was right off the interstate and I didn't feel like finding the front of the hotel. Sometimes self-park can be a nightmare because the garage is usually so far away from the actual lobby. Fortunately I only had to walk through a small portion of the hotel to get to the lobby. 

The registration desk was well staffed and the lady who checked me in was very friendly and efficient. I really like efficiency. Friendly is nice too.

THE ROOM (first impressions)
Within minutes I had my key and headed up the elevator to my room. As I walked in I was pleasantly surprised. I hadn't expected to have an entire seating area, but there it was in all it's chaise lounge and sofa glory. I think I actually squealed. I couldn't wait to lounge on the chaise and read something on my Kindle. I have yet to do that, but that's only because I just spent 2.5 hours soaking in the nice, big tub with wine and a movie.

The room is large, the TV is large, the bathroom TV rotates, the bath is large, the separate shower is large, pretty much everything is bigger than most standard Vegas rooms. I bounced around the room sitting on everything, playing with everything and finally taking my journalistic photos before unpacking. 

THE ROOM (second impression)
After the initial ""this is so much better than I expected"" response I started to notice the few things that could be improved upon. None of them are deal breakers but maybe something for the hotel to think about on the next remodel. The TOILET: It is in a separate closet. Quite literally a water closet. This is a nice feature if you are staying in a room with 4 other people because you can get a little privacy without taking over the bathroom BUT the door will not stay open on its own so you have to either prop it open with a suitcase or just suffer as the door slams shut and encloses you in your tiny little claustrophobic water closet.

Two other nit-picky minor things: 

The bath tub is great. I usually avoid baths in hotels because it grosses me out, but this one seemed clean and just looked way too inviting to avoid. However, there isn't any bubble bath in the amenities tray. I would have adored some lavender scented bubble bath to lull me to sleep. Luckily I drove so I had an entire bottle of body wash. Squirt! 

The second thing: I really wish a corkscrew was included in the mini-bar. All of the drinks are screw top, but I bought a bottle of wine at the store downstairs and when I came up to the room I realized I had wine glasses but no corkscrew. I spent a good 30 minutes trying to get the cork to push INTO the bottle. I definitely needed a drink after that. :)


THINGS TO LOVE:

Despite the minor problems, I am having a very hard time finding things I don't love. 

The bed is comfortable. A bit bouncy but I foresee a great nights sleep.

The mini-bar is well stocked and even though the alcohol prices are outrageous, the sodas and juices aren't too bad. But I will still be using the vending machine down the hall.

The seating area is great. The couch and chaise could use a little more cushioning, but they serve their purpose nicely.

The bathroom is huge and looks great. It doesn't feel like a hotel bathroom which is fantastic for a weekend of relaxation. The floor is VERY slippery when wet so definitely walk with caution after a shower or bath. 

Power outlets are everywhere. I wish more hotels would take a cue from MB. There are 8 readily available outlets in the main area and two more in the bathroom. While I don't need all of them, anyone traveling with 4 people knows how important that is. Cell phones, camera battery chargers, laptops, etc. Power outlets disappear quickly with groups.

Elevators are quick and plentiful. There are about 36 floors and those are divided up into three sections and each section gets 10 elevators. That's 30 elevators folks. They move quickly and I haven't had to wait yet. 

Casino floor isn't very crowded which is good or bad depending on your preference. 

THE BEST PART ABOUT THIS HOTEL:

This hotel actually gives you something in return for the mandatory Daily Resort Fee that hotels in Vegas love to add on.

You get access to the Cardio Room and FREE WIRELESS internet. Most hotels charge at least $30 for one-day cardio room access and $15 for wireless internet. That is like hitting a small jackpot in my book",5,2,3

To be fair, the place does look beautiful. It's somewhat new, the showers and tubs are awesome (if the maids have cleaned the hair out first), the inside of the suite is pretty plush, and the stay wasn't overall too bad. There are some things Mandalay Bay can control and there are some that they can't .

I just don't understand why they would put pictures of young good looking people partying on their brochures when the place is CLEARLY geared towards kids and the elderly. I know you'll laugh at me for complaining about this but the television literally had like 8 channels and 3 of the were just a 24 hour infomercial for the hotel that we were staying at.

Really the icing on the cake was being denied a late checkout when we stood in line over an hour to check in. The lady on the other end of the phone acted like I was the millionth person in the last 5 minutes to ask her for such a ridiculous request.

When I arrived at the hotel to check in, they tell me they can't find my room.  I begin to panic, but was able to find a confirmation number from Expedia (we booked through them).   They finally find my reservation just to tell me that they don't have a spa suite available, but will be happy to compensate by giving me $100 in slot play.  Ummm...........$100?!?!  I paid nearly $700 for 2 nights stay in a spa suite.  You want to downgrade me to a regular room which runs about $150 a night.... So that's nearly a $400 difference and you're going to give me $100?!?!?     Ummmm........I think not.  If you're going to give me a regular room, then you're going to reimburse me the difference, OR you can give me the room I booked in the 1st place.  I don't know what their customer service team is thinking, seriously.  So I basically had to argue back and forth for about 20 minutes with the check-in clerk.  Finally, she went to go get a manager just before I was about to lose my cool, and suddenly.... Wa la!  They magically found me a spa suite.  So they basically lied the entire time, and when they realized I wasn't going to give in, they gave me what I wanted.  I will not ever waste my money on this establishment again.  I'll stick to Bellagio and Treasure Island from now on.  Mandalay Bay has a few things to learn about customer service, ESPECIALLY at the rates they charge.

Because this is an MGM resort, we were able to valet park.  We had valeted at several of the hotels on the strip and all of the attendants were friendly and fast.  Unfortunately, this one was not.  
When we pulled up, we waited in our car for 10 minutes (and that is being generous) for the attendant to come over to our car.  We actually thought he must have been off of work because while he knew we were waiting, he didn't seem to care at all.   He was too busy having personal and apparently funny conversations with several other employees.  Once his fun was over, he walked over to our car and greeted us as if we were bothering him.  My husband commented about how long we had waited and his response was very rude, almost as if he was wanting to try to start an argument.  He was so offensive that I told my husband that we should just leave.  When the show was over and requested our car, the wait was almost as long as when we had arrived. Fortunately, the attendant that brought our car around was much friendlier.

I appreciate the website's feature to search for dates and rates using a visual calendar. It's called the Rate Calendar (https:\/\/www.mandalaybay.com\/en\/booking\/room-booking.html#\/step1).  One date may list $495 for a room rate and another date may be $65 for the same room, on a different date.  When we have a flexible schedule and want a get away, the calendar helps with booking and reserving the best room for us.  

My favorite aspects of Mandalay Bay's resort are amenities.  I take the children to Shark Reef.  Check the Nevada Resident rate to save money.  I personally prefer holding an Annual Pass (http:\/\/sharkreef.com\/visitor\/prices.aspx).  Unfortunately, there is no Family Annual Pass. I hope Shark Reef changes the annual pass policy, soon.  Clark County School District Teachers can gain free admission on certain days of the month, with union membership (check ESEA-NV.org) and on special events like Teacher Appreciation Week(http:\/\/www.reviewjournal.com\/entertainment\/shows\/strip-tips-shark-reef-offers-free-admission-teachers). Good eats are key at the Mandalay Bay.  I find several restaurants for organic options and fresh foods:  Border Grill, Citizens, and RM Seafood.  I also enjoy the  Ri Ra irish Pub and Hubert Keller's Burger Bar (free-range, organic, vegetarian and pescetarian options). We've been to special, local events (Ri Ra has a room just for groups). Of course, the wave pool and lazy river are top of my list for kid-friendly and family fun.  

I attended a conference this past week.  Get ready to walk. The convention center is enormous, with two sets of escalators ascending and descending to a third story of rooms. If the event is scheduled with a headliner, there will be signs galore to guide you to your destination. But, if the event is small (e.g. 1500 guests) signage may not be available.  Here I am, walking and searching. I am a local resident and I have visited here, many times. Yet,  I could not navigate the layout.

The hotel, casino, and convention area is massive, and it is growing even larger. It does take about 15-20 minutes to walk from one end of the casino to the other.

Hotel guest check-in was smooth with Cornelia. I love the Peter Lik photography adorned at the check-in\/ check-out lobby area.

This hotel has beautiful rooms, and the higher floors offer great views. Like most strip hotels, you'll see the same standard amenities in the room (e.g., frig, water, alcohol, chips, nuts, chocolate, hairdryer, soap, shampoo, conditioner). The room I had was facing the airport, beach, and pools. It was beautiful watching the planes take off and land and seeing all the pool lights and greenery.  

There are many restaurants as well. The hotel's buffet is called Bayside Buffet. My Sunday brunch was $26.00. This is seems to be competitive with other strip buffet's but it is totally not worth the expense. The flow of the buffet is poorly designed. The selection and quality of food is average.

Parking in the garage is an adventure in the summer. It is very hot and poorly ventilated. I recommend valet parking.

The events are the best part. They always have something going on. At the beach they have a concert series. It is amazing to watch a concert on sand or up to knee high the water close to the stage.  The Mandalay Event Center also hosts concerts. I believe it is the best event center on the strip. The flow in and out is easy and the seating is beautifully arranged such most seats offer good views of the stage area.

The pool offers cabana's that tend to run hundreds of dollars. It would be nice if Mandalay Bay offered a discount price after prime-time hours as conventioneers could continue their small business meetings outside near the pool without having to leave the Mandalay property or take up space at a restaurant when they aren't hungry; most will not pay that high price for a short business meeting lasting an hour or two.",2,0,1

Cons:  Pool and fitness center hours are too short:  The entire pool area normally closes at 7 pm, and they close even earlier when reserved for events and parties.  The fitness center closes at 8 pm. The reason this was so significant for us, is that we brought 2 kids with us that were looking forward to what MB is famous for (the pools).  Otherwise, there is not much to do at or around the hotel, since it is at the end of the end of the strip, and to get to other attractions and shops (e.g., the M&M store and Arventuredome), you have to either drive or take a rather long walk.  Finally, although probably a common problem with large hotel pools in vegas, the pool gets very dirty with the filth of alcohol cans and sunblock, which will keep your eyes burning for a couple days unless you wear goggles (a problem if you have kids)

Advice: if it's your first time using the lazy pool, you can save some $ by bringing your own inner tube for the lazy river (they do not rent any, and charge $18 - 22 to purchase theirs).  As with any other LV hotels, be prepared to spend a lot of money on food and drinks, particularly if you have kids... they do not allow coolers or food\/drink from outside the pool.  Try avoid paying retail for the Shark Reef- it's a nice little exhibit, but not worth $1 per minute (you can easily scoot through it in less than 20 minutes, which isn't much for an $18 adult ticket)",0,0,0

Our experience started with very poor valet service. Handed us a ticket and disappeared. Four women with suitcases and nothing. No directions nothing, we ended up walking in the wrong door and walked the entire casino.
Next, when I booked the one bedroom suite, it said online it has a refrigerator and coffee maker. The refrigerator was full of items they charge you for. Be careful don't touch the mini bar items at 6.00 for a can of soda. What upset me was the coffee maker you had to pay to use it. Each cup of coffee was $4.00. No sugar no cream no stir stick. You've got to be kidding me. You pay that much money for a suite and they want to charge you for a bad cup of coffee. 
Next, You book a room for four people and they give you two towels. (2).

The rooms could have been shared comfortably and partied in pragmatically, no doubt. While I will give management credit for satisfactorily resolving our issues, the fact we encountered them at all for the rate we were paying was ridiculous. Then there were the amenities. The gym was small for the rate and the pool opened way late in the morning and closed too early at night.

Let me begin by saying, my stay was an utter disappointment.

Cons:
-Not one bellman greeted us or helped us with our several heavy bags upon arrival and departure. They were there, they looked dead at us, but never offered assistance. My mind was boggled. They didn't even greet us when we got dropped off in ubers. They were a disgrace.

-The maid service doesn't automatically give you wash cloths unless you request them. And when you do, they will not be able to provide them until after 4pm. *side eye*

-We booked a 4 night stay, on day 2, both room keys stopped working.

-The maid service comes at 8am. Helloooo this is Vegas! No one is up at 8am. Checkout isn't even until 11am. And then if you tell them to come back, they'll come at 9am. And if your ""do not disturb"" sign isn't out, they'll just walk in. Smh.


Pros:
-The beds are so comfortable, I thought I was sleeping on a cloud. 

-The staff is nice. Because of our experience, we were given a late checkout, a $50 food credit and $50 off our bill.

-They have a cool little rooftop lounge\/club called Foundation with an incredible view of the strip.

Conclusion:
I will not stay here again. I knew Mandalay Bay is only a 4 star hotel but I didn't expect 2 star service. Stay at the Encore suites at the Wynn if you really want a luxury experience.",3,2,0

Check in went smoothly, but I had to fight them over the extra $25 per day ""hotel fee"" that I was never told about before hand. Once I showed them my paid in full receipt with no mention of an additional fee, they ""waived"" it. My advice, pay for your room on a discount Internet site and be done with it. 

After that mostly everything went great. All the service people, waiters\/waitresses, room service, everyone, was super accommodating and pleasant. 

The room was super spacious with a 42"" flat screen, sitting area with table, enormous bathroom with separate shower and tub. My view was of the airport and pool areas, which turned out fine. Watching the planes take off and land while drinking my coffee to wake up in the mornings was fun. 

The best deal for the money were the lounge performers. I saw all types of bands, and one was better than the next. There is a two drink minimum at the tables, but they had Dos XX beer for only $5 each. Not a bad deal. The music and musicians were really top quality. 

My family did the Gospel brunch on Sunday which was incredible. Five big beautiful sisters, with band, singing their hearts out for Jesus. They got the crowd going and we had ""chach"". And the southern food brunch was some of the best food I had the entire stay. Biscuits and gravy, ribs, huge shrimps, enormous strips of bacon and sausage, freshly made on the spot hot waffles, omletes, grits, etc, etc. For $40 pp it was the most uplifting and fulfilling (burp:-) experience in Vegas. 

Check out from the room tv is super easy. So why wait on line at the front desk when you can do it in 2 minutes from your room. But do it when you're ready to leave because nothing will work (ie key to the room) after that. 

Tips - when going to the hotel from the airport tell the cabbie to take Tropicana Ave (about $15-$18). Otherwise they'll take the highway and it'll cost $5-$10 more. And if you do it via Tropicana Ave it costs about as much as the hotel shuttles. 

Mandalay Bay is at the end of the strip. So, it's about 1-2 miles to get to the heart of the activity. Traffic is like 5th Avenue at rush hour. So leave early, unless you hit it right at the off hours. 

Other great hotels\/malls are Caesars, Paris, and Venetian. They're fun to walk around in with all the cute shops and eateries and events. Most of the prices are inflated (i.e. Starbucks $1 more for everything). But we all went to Cheese Cake Factory one night where the prices and food were the same as home. The buffet at the Paris is amazing and quite different due to the French flare. 

Get to the pool early or it's very hard to find a seat. If you want it quieter go to Landshark Lagoon or Lazy River pool areas. One annoyance was the Landshark not opening until 12 noon on Memorial Day, a super busy day. But when it did open it  was no problem for all 15 of us to sit near eachother, with some in the shade. Allison was super nice and sweet getting me an armed chair each day, which I prefer and are not available unless you get a cabana. Thanks Allison.

This time, I really needed to get some work done before a conference that starts tomorrow. The internet connection wasn't working. I tried to call the tech support line, but the phone wasn't working. Turned out the only way to use the phone was to put it on speaker. The problem with that was you can't hear or understand the other party (even with the volume turned all the way up) unless you put your head down to the desk close to the phone. I asked the front desk to swap out the phone, and the soonest they can have someone up to fix it is the next afternoon. I'm checking out in the morning, so that's no help. Plus it took three and a half hours for them to bring a refrigerator to the room. 

By the way, in order to use their Internet service, you have to turn off any firewall you have running and LEAVE IT OFF, according to their tech support.

Tonight (actually around 2:30 a.m.) I was hungry, so I stopped in at Raffles hoping to get something to bring up to my room. They won't pack any food to go at Raffles. Fine, I sat down and was ready to eat. I sat at the table for about a half hour -- there were three or four other tables occupied in the dining room -- but no server or even bus boy ever came into the room. So I came up to the room and ordered from room service at a price that is three times what I would have paid at Raffles (if they any servers in the room).

The check in is huge, but there was a line...on a Wednesday... In the late evening . The reason might be that they only had 3 people checking in people despite having like 20 counters!

Our reservation which we made via Expedia for ONE King, seems to have gotten lost in the shuffle and they up-charged $10 per night to go from 2 queens to 1 king (Bullshit).

The room was a good size and was over looking the pool. The mattress, was semi hard and I woke up feeling untested, stiff, and with lower back aches. (I guess a Temperpedic really works) The pillows, were hard and to damn tall. Now that I think about it, this was probably causing my stiff necks. The shower, had a slow drain which means you stood in about an inch of water during showering. The ventilation in the shower - Horrible. No vent in the toilet room which sucks if you are rooming with someone - period.

The pools - awesome! They have a wave pool, reg pool, and my fav - a lazy river! The inner-tubes though, are a rip off. You have to buy ($20) because they don't rent them. Moorea Beach, is definitely worth the money guys, but don't be that peerv and go there alone that's what strip bars are for.

Maybe I was expecting too much. Arrive on Monday afternoon around 4, waited 20 minutes for my turn at valet and was told I should come back later because (A) valet is full, and (B) the registration line is 1.5 hour long.

Came back at 7:30PM and checked in and was told they have started charging for parking (stayed at Venetian and Wynn last 2 time, they have not started charging.) Agreed to valet for $18 a night thinking will get car faster next morning. (Self-parking is $10.)

Room was very nice and has one of the best mattress in Vegas hotels.  However, room was missing shower cap and the plastic bag for holding ice.  Also the shower drains very slowly, can just imagine a giant clump of hair in the drain.

Next morning paid the valet fee with the room TV and called down from my room to valet for the car, was told no problem still need to show them my valet ticket when I get down. Got to valet station and there was only one person at the counter and the line is about 25 deep and it was barely moving the guest at the counter was disputing the garage fee.  BTW, the 2 autopay parking machines were broken so we have to wait our turn with a human.

After showing them my valet ticket I waited another 25 minutes for my car to show up.  I don't think my calling ahead did anything.

So maybe I was wrong to expect better service after paying $18 for valet (I still tipped the guy getting the car to me, it's not his fault.)

They are on a little island on the edge of the strip. It's such a nice hotel but so far from all the ""action"" of Aria and XS, Marquee and Tao  and all other things that people like to go to in Vegas. 

The hotel rooms are spacious and have comfortable beds. A lot of closet space too. I was very impressed. Their bathrooms are also a lot better than most of the ones I've seen on the strip.

I've stayed at Mandalay and TheHotel so Ill leave my TheHotel review on the other page but that was nice too.

The pool with the lazy ricer is cool. Food spot right by the lay out area and really good mojitos. The  beach casino is small but when it's not crowded its a nice place to relax and gamble.

The casino gets pretty crowded which is surprising to me since it's on the edge of the strip but it's a fun environment. If the minimums are too high they are connected to Luxor which has lower minimums.

It can get pricey and busy when there is a fight here or at MGM but that's another exciting thing to do in Vegas, watch a fight!

Mandalay also offers a lot of comped rooms for future visits so that is definitely a plus.

I asked for directions several times and kept getting pointed the wrong way.  I also made my way all the way to excalibur to get to play some $5 tables.

To be fair, because I was there for work, didn't get to check out the pool which is supposed to be great, so maybe next time I'm in Vegas, I'll give it another whirl.  But given that I've also stayed at Planet Hollywood, Mirage and Venetian on prior stays, this wasn't my top pick.",1,0,0

The hotel was clean, the service was stand-out and the spa was intoxicatingly relaxing.  However, this stay was a little less than what we remembered from our previous stay which bumped it down a couple of notches, and is the reason we will probably try a new hotel on our next trip.

Booking
I booked a Grand Suite through M Life in May for a 3 night stay beginning on Dec. 31.  The trip was over NYE, but the main reason was for my husband's 30th birthday.  I was really excited to surprise him with the suite, and called the concierge about 2 weeks ahead of time to get suggestions for dinner reservations, NYE events and to let them know it would be his birthday.

Check-In
We arrived at the hotel around 9 AM, so we expected to have to drop off our bags and hang for a while until the regular check-in time.  There was already a line, but it moved quickly.  The man that checked us in (I can't recall his name) was very friendly and chatted with us a bit as he looked up our reservation.  He then broke the news that the Grand Suites had been overbooked, and laid out a few different options for us: a double-queen strip view room, a Bay Suite or a room in the Delano.  We inquired about the room at the Delano, since they are all set up as suites, but he couldn't tell us much about the room or the rate, and we didn't want to accept without knowing the details.  The Bay Suite would have been a pool-view room on a lower level which sounded o.k., but kind of boring since it was the middle of winter, so we settled on the double-queen room with the strip view so that we could watch the NYE fireworks from our room and avoid getting out in the crowds & cold.  They thankfully adjusted our bill down a little bit, but it was still a pretty big disappointment not getting the room we had reserved over six months ahead of time.

Room
Our double queen strip-view room was newly remodeled and very nicely decorated. We didn't feel cramped, and the view was stunning!  We could see both the airport and a good part of the strip.  This made for a perfect view of the fireworks shows for NYE.  The bathroom was good-sized with a private toilet area which is always nice.  The shower was great; plenty of hot water, and even a nice shower head with a few different adjustable flow settings.  The tub was good sized for one person. I ended up being strangely glad we got 2 beds since our room got so hot at night we had to sleep separately to be comfortable, even with the thermostat turned way down.

Facilities
I went down to the cardio room for a morning workout, and there was already a crowd gathered at the door.  Turns out they couldn't get the doors open to let anyone in, so after a few minutes we were escorted to the full gym through the spa.  Honestly, I'm glad that was the case because this gym was much bigger and nicer with top-of-the-line equipment.  I'm not sure the one person that was exercising in there before our group of about 8 arrived was too thrilled to see us, but it was actually big enough that we weren't on top of one another.  I really wish you didn't have to pay a $25 per day fee to use it!  It's a great hidden gem.

Casino
One of our favorite parts about the casino at Mandalay Bay is that it doesn't have that all-too-typical stale smoke smell that many of the strip casinos do.  There were plenty of open tables and slots to choose from, but just the right amount of people that it was fun.  Our main issue was the entire time we gambled throughout the 3 days, we NEVER saw a cocktail waitress. It may have been because of the busy holiday weekend, but I will say that it definitely cut our gambling time short since it's just not as fun when you have to stop and buy $8 Miller Lites from the bar.

Housekeeping
Odd.  Our first day, we arrived back to our room in the afternoon to made beds, but not much else.  I honestly thought something happened in the middle of cleaning, because the duster was even left behind.  We left the duster where it was, thinking they would just get it the next day, but no such luck; it stayed there with us the entire time.  I started to wonder if it was some sort of message.  Compared to the immaculate attention to detail that was taken last time, this just seemed totally off and haphazard.  We never returned to a ""clean"" room.  Again, maybe because it was so busy that weekend, but I've not really experienced anything quite like that when staying at a hotel.


All-in-all, our stay was decent but nothing compared to our first time.  Granted our first stay was during pool season, which is definitely something to experience!  I really just wish we could have had the intimate, romantic weekend-in-a-suite trip we'd originally planned and that the hotel might have even made some sort of gesture to acknowledge my husband's birthday trip.  It's always the small things that go the farthest, but this time it was simply lacking.",0,0,0

The wedding reception was ultimately amazing and exactly how we wanted it, even despite how our space, which was booked from 3 PM on was somehow still being cleaned and prepared at 7:15 and no one wanted to take responsibility for it... but at the end of the day, it all worked out..

But I simply cannot promote a luxury hotel that allows theft to occur without investigation or reimbursement. We had our Swavorski crystal embellished cake cutter set that was engraved with our names and wedding date stolen by 1 of 3 members of their clean up crew. My husband and I were the only 2 people present when they came, and we had just scoured the place for the items we did not want cleaned and organized them with our other personal belongings. I had put the cutter set in its case far away from all other utensils and dishware. It was gone ten minutes later. There is no way these were taken to be cleaned by mistake. Mandalay Bay hires thieves who don't discriminate, not even a newlywed couple was spared.

When I reported this to housekeeping, security, and my wedding coordinator, the only thing that was done was to ask the dish washing department to look out for them. We were not offered to be reimbursed for our loss, and when I pursued the idea with them due to sentimental value (we cut our wedding cake with them) it was ignored several times.

It disturbs me to think of the wealthier people or celebrities who may also have stayed in the Media Suite and had less noticeable items of value stolen. For spending the amount of money we did for our reception and room, we should have been met with an offer of reimbursement and an apology. Sadly, our item can never truly be replaced... You only get one chance to cut the cake on your wedding.",9,0,2

It's at the end of the strip, and it's a very large resort. The place is a bit of a maze. Unfortunately, the first room they put me in was dirty. The beds were made, but there were used bottles on the table, and dirty towels in the bathroom. I was hoping they would move me to a better room, but they were only able to move me to a new room, with a concession of removing a night's resort fees. However, the room they moved me to only had one bed, when I had clearly reserved a room with two. So it's now midnight, and I'm still not in an appropriate room. Luckily my sister and friend were not joining me for a few days, because they were apparently completely out of this type of room with two beds. Once again, surprised they didn't just upgrade me. The next day they moved me, but the key card didn't work! Also, my room faced the airport. For my inconvenience, they refunded me anther night of resort fees. Once things settled down, everything went pretty smoothly. I enjoyed the wave pool, but the waves need to occur more often. The tubes for the lazy river costs 22.50, which is ridiculous.

I don't totally mind the fact that they are now charging for parking. But the execution of this is a fail. It literally takes 38+ minutes to get into the parking garage, even longer on a busy night. The new system causes a backlog of vehicles in all directions.   They can't move cars into the garage in a timely manor as each one has to stop, and grab a ticket or scan their id. 

While waiting in the long line. I see people getting out of their taxis and Ubers and just walking to the casino entrance. Kind of defeats the purpose of catching a ride if you still have to walk. And these drivers are still stuck in line which doesn't help the rest of us trying to get in to park.

On what was to be my 1st experience in Las Vegas, this is the poorest excuse of customer service I have ever experienced.

Upon check in, we were made aware that special requests were only honored when available. I get that. I'm not completely clueless to customer demand. But upon check-in, it should not have taken your agent to have to go back to 'back office' four times for a manager to come out to field a customer complaint. And when said manager, I believe her name was Kristin Kutcher, I thought it was to work some ""customer service magic"" and come up with a compromise, not to basically tell us ""tough shi*"". So begrudgingly, we took the handicap accessible room that was given to us. (Also, I would seriously reconsider your training tools when it is acceptable for a 'manager' to respond with blatant attitude from two customer service stations away about ""how much she DOES LOVE HER JOB, thank you very much"", when a unsatisfied customer voices his difference of opinion to HIS friend).
Come to find out the next morning that the shower that only had a curtain, no lip or door, drain was clogged which flooded our entire bathroom. When going downstairs to complain, we had a maintenance person basically plunge and snake the drain and use the towels designated to OUR ROOM to clean it up. And THEN dump all the dirty towels in the bathtub and say somebody will be back later to clean this up... and 8 hours later, with dirty towels STILL in the tub and dried up left over debris from the drain all over the floor, NADA?!?!? And on top of that one of the 2 TVs didn't even work. Room # 33125, in case you were wondering. Upon coming downstairs to inquire about the situation, I was given notice about the room change and what kind of timely manner I was expected to collect my things. So within an hour, our room was changed (to #33317) which was about the same except this shower had hair all over the shower from the previous guest...

Wow, way to drop the ball on this one. I would like to make note that I DID try to contact you via private email groupleads@mandalaybay.com, the ONLY email address that can be found on your website) while we were STILL THERE to maybe rectify the disappointment, and unfortunately it looks like it had gotten 'lost in cyberspace'.

I am well aware that you are a multi million dollar, if not billion dollar establishment and wanted to express to you that, although we were not 'high rollers', our money is just as green as anybody else and we should have been treated appropriately.


UPDATED 7\/15\/2014

I didn't think I could have left with a worse 1st time impression of a hotel than i did with this company. I was wrong. I do want to acknowledge that the Facebook rep that did contact me was helpful as to direct my concerns to the appropriate channels. So, good for him\/her. Outside of that... I was contacted by their social media department. I did get a letter profusely apologizing for all the issued i incurred. And if I could say I was satisfied, I would do so here. But I'm not. they did review my concerns and did in fact in an effort of ""goodwill"" credit my account resort fees that were charged to me. which i believe was around $100. but compared to what was initially pre-paid for the room, this is the equivalent to THE TAX. I compare this to going to a high end restaurant, having terrible service and horrible food and having the restaurant taking my iced tea off the bill. 

Although this has some features i did like very much, (citizen's restaurant was delicious. and I'm sure the Michael Jackson\/Cirque du Soleil, is amazing) I would tell anybody (EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT READS THIS)...

DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL.

The guest service offered complimentary beverages and asked that we stay in the current room since there were no other rooms available. I made it very clear that we wanted a clean room and not really care for free stuff or if the room was big or small. We finally got a small deluxe room after two hours and this room is better but not a very good quality. MB really needs to upgrade and decorate their rooms better. Travelodge might have better rooms.

Went down stairs to complain and when I asked for a manager the desk clerk did every song and dance in the book to not let me talk to someone. So I had to pull out the pictures of the bloody pillows to finally get a manager. So they changed my room to a smaller room with a crummy view..

The Casino is dirty carpet, smoky and lame. The casino floor clubs have auto-tuners and totally lip synced fake music. The air is not clean on the casino floor (poorly ventilated, I dont mind smelling smoke, but the air here lingers and stinks). The foundation room and the Mix clubs are both lame and they are charging to go up, I just want to see a view, but they turn this into a nightclub thing, very stupid. The clubs are not worth being charged for at all.

Pool area is neat. Not a bad pool at all. But there are towel issues and they even check bottled water for booze! 

Where the 1-star comes in is the unprofessional staff, the thievery, the lies and the cheating. The room rates have been going down slightly, but there is a catch. Some of the worst airplane-food is served at Raffles and the Red White and Blue, and they charge criminal rates for this food. The food at Strip Steak was mediocre, but the cost was outrageous and the service was completely unprofessional. We had a $800 bill for three people, and the service was rude and the food just ok. One server at Strip Steak spoke to a drunk couple while we waited for 10 minutes to order. 

Lupo is not very good, total sham for the price. Fleur by Hubert Keller was ok, service was good, food just ok, but prices were outrageous.  Aureole could be nice, but the prices are outrageous and the format of this restaurant needs work, its not an inviting place to go and have a few glasses of wine and an appetizer, they want to sell you a 9 course mediocre meal. It also closes way too early. China Grill, prices are outrageous, and this lame place isnt open for lunch and closes early. In fact, most places close early. Border Grill just stinks. Low quality food and outrageous prices.

I really believe in freedom, liberty, and the free market - but the prices here are nearly criminal. Sure they can charge what they want, but its a fraud, they give you a ""deal on the room,"" and they have the convention center and drag us all into events here, but then they cheat overcharge and deliver bad food products for bad prices.

The Ri Ra bar on the way to Luxor was the only good place in there, good fish and chips, beers were good, a bit expensive but not as bad as the rubbish in the Mandalay. The crepes place is no good, takes forever and is overpriced. Ice bar is completely lame. The seafood place, I forget the name, is lame, and has a prix fixe menu with venison on it in a seafood place. The prices were completely outrageous there as well. 

This hotel has huge potential, but its being run by greedy people obsessed with taking working family men like myself and shaking us down for every single penny in our wallets. 

The in room minibar is a total rip off and there is no room for your own stuff and there is a hyper sensitive item removal detector on each item so if you bump them while storing medicine you get charged and you have to dispute a payment for something you didn't even drink.

The tubs are nice, but the shower is a low flow shower head which sucks. I'm letting hotels know something, if you put that low flow shower head in, I run the shower for hours to ""punish"" you for this. You'll rack up a years worth of water charges because you cheated me out of a decent shower. 

The walls here are paper thin, so if you get a spring break next door you are doomed. I just run water to down out the sounds. 

Raffles is the late night dining. The service can be good or super super slow its random. Food quality is airplane-food. 

The towel situation at the pool stinks. 

There are no moving (Jetson's) sidewalks on the way to the convention area. The convention area is like a half mile from the smell casino area , and walking there is ridiculous. 

The service in general here is terrible. The managers are no good, the dealers are rude, the bartenders are mean spirited. Ri Ra was good, but the rest were very annoying. Ri Ra's bar tenders are actually from Ireland. 

I really find the way this property is run to be offensive and below what should be for a potentially great hotel.

The towels and the sheets and the other linens were smelling ""burnt,"" like very cheap detergent was used and the linen fibers were being burned by super hot dryer. 

The internet service was very spotty, it could take a long time to ""agree"", and transfer rates ranged from good to zero. 

A large number of employees have piercings and tattoos which are unprofessional and need to be covered up. 

I really think Mandalay has gone from interesting and nice looking with lots of potential to being a criminal fraudulent terrible place to stay at and to be at.",3,1,0

There is a tram or indoor walk route that leads you to Luxor Excalibur New York New York. 

Rooms have tubs which I like. They have a cardio exercise room downstairs that's open to guests but the gym is part of the spa and they charge a fee for daily access. 

There is a chapel, food court with subway etc, shark reef aquarium that's about $18-20 per person

One thing that stood out for me was the HDTV in the room. Why? Because there were HD channels!

I was so happy to see Mandalay Bay caught up with the times. The TV in the bathroom was cool too.

On a recent trip here, a friend of mine upgraded to a suite on the top floor (62nd floor). It was a suite that Mandalay Bay supposedly never sells and only comps to high rollers. I must reiterate the word, ""supposedly."" I have to say, the suite was really nice. There was a dining table, 1.5 baths, separate bedroom, kitchen area, and two large HDTVs. Looking out of the windows, you felt like you were on top of the world.

Myself and a group of 5 other people chose the Mandalay Bay when we came here on our trip to the Electric Daisy Carnival. Ok, I get it a bunch of 'raver kids' coming to the hotel might look bad. We're all in our early thirties and ALL worked service industry jobs at some point so we know the value of tipping, courtesy, etc. between the 6 of us we spent a total of 5000$ over 4 days solely on our rooms. 

The suite we were put in had food in it from THE LAST occupant. There were sauces spilled everywhere. This is the smallest aggravation I had of the weekend. The other room we rented was OK. I asked for a city view that I was charged extra for and they gave me a nice brown view of the airport. There was no refrigerator so essentially we had to eat out every meal despite bringing plenty of snacks. 

The casino and lobby were insanely confusing. We had to ask multiple people where we were going even after we had been there for 3 days. There is little signage or direction anywhere. 

When we finally found the restaurants we were looking for, we found the food was sub par. We checked out the burger place, and the Mexican cantina next to it. For 170$ each time I was less than impressed. 

So, with all of that being said, everything would have been just a lesson learned and I would have left upset but not steaming like I am now. I say this because the service was absolutely HORRIBLE. Every single person I spoke to was incredibly rude. It must be where bartenders, concierge, servers etc. go to die because everyone was in their 50's\/60's and crotchety. Although we had awful service we STILL tipped 25% everywhere and after doing so, some attitudes perked up. 

I won't name names even though I should but the woman and the concierge was one of the more rude people I've met. She literally gets paid to be nice. Also the older man at the bar in the casino was extremely condescending until we tipped and he realized we weren't pieces of s***. 

The only high note of the experience was the delicious nicer Mexican restaurant close to the food court. We had a lovely server who was extremely accommodating and treated us like human beings. Imagine that. We left her 200$ on a 100$ tab.

The third reason - WAY too many kids! I felt I couldn't really enjoy Vegas to full extent as there were so many strollers and kids walking all over the casino. I mean really people - go to circus circus if you really HAVE to bring your kids. You really don't. It's expensive and not appropriate when there is so much second hand smoke around (I was having trouble dealing with that, and can only imagine how the kids feel!). 
Because there were so many kids, I ended up going to the Luxor and Excelsior and other casinos to go have fun. The pools were packed with families and kids and not the setting I was hoping for my first Vegas trip-1

The good points are that the hotel itself is beautiful, the room was very nice with great view. The walls are thin though and the neighbors (who had kids) were banging on our door asking that me and my friend , to keep it down because they couldn't sleep (11pm). What's worse is that at that time we were just watching tv and not even talking loud or doing anything else since we had just flown in and were already tired. 

The restaurants at the Mandalay were awesome! Hubert Keller's burger bar was awesome (must try nutella shake) as well as Border Grill (carnitas were heaven).  I was there for a training for work and the convention center was great, roomy, even though quite far. The Shark Aquarium was also really cool, though a lot smaller than I expected. 

My recommendation - if you are looking for family friendly hotel and Casino, I guess this would be the place. If you are Young, single or just want to party at Vegas - this is not the place to stay.  When I go back to Vegas I will go to a more adult centered hotel.",3,1,1

First, they should seriously remodel and upgrade the rooms, it looks like a room from the 90's. Secondly, you be very disappointed as the doors separating the bedrooms and the living\/dining area are glass door not solid wood doors.

Dirty sheets (with hair) upon my check in. Asked housekeeping to come up to clean the bedding and dust and she said it was in this condition because the room was empty for 3 days. Ok I said,  but I would expect you to dust before someone checks in if you knew it was empty for several days. Blank stare from the housekeeper and the experience just went downhill from that point. 

Mandalay Bay Resort is an Mlife property; a group of incompetent C suite executives that obviously care much more about profits than the well being of their guest. 

The staff is 50% helpful and 50% take it or leave it. Housekeeping will constantly throw your do not disturb sign on the floor (or not) and walk in your room. In the winter months the main pools are closed, but you still pay the same resort fee. 

The Mandalay Bay Resort is exclusively for the brain dead or emotionally challenged and anyone with the slightest concern for their own well being, should avoid this place like the plague.

Pros: Rooms are very nicely decorated. Some operators are very sweet but rather limited in their capacity for making your stay welcoming. Tony and Spencer are very strong massage therapist that work at the bath house in the connected Delano Hotel. Beds are very comfortable with great linens and pillows. The resort ATM's are great with a fair 5.99 withdraw fee. Room and suite prices are reasonable. 

Cons: Quoted a ruthless $11- $13 dollars per minute plus a 50% surcharge for a long distance USA phone call. Early morning construction (10 floors above) make sleeping past 7 am impossible. A filthy, smelly  resort with disgusting smokers at every turn. An Mlife 13 resort monopoly means that you are overcharged for everything but the room rate. A ""take it or leave it""  attitude similar to what one would expect in a minimum security prison. You can't even use the refrigerator for your own purpose, only to stock their overpriced poisons. Everything has a charge from hot water, each tea cup and  their 4 dollar sugar caddy. Despite the pools being closed during my stay you still pay a resort fee and you can't even take a hot steam without doubling the resort fee. Maids don't respect your privacy at all. Dirty room at check in. Clueless C suite executives making decisions for this property all based on the fact that the town is run by ruthless monopolies. Consiear service very unhelpful unless your request is going to pad the pockets of the Mlife group. Just ugly on every level. They wanted to keep you in their walls so bad that no one in the entire resort could supply access to a yellow pages. Food throughout the resort was average at best. 

Why am I paying a resort fee if the pools are closed? Is it to walk through the smoke filled casino or for taking 10 minutes to get to my room? This place was much different and better 8 years ago or I was younger and dumber.",3,4,2

The rooms are beautiful and spacious and the restaurants it encompasses are classy and elegant. (Rick Moonen and Hubert Keller restaurants in the same place? Amazing!) This was my issue. We bought a package deal with Lion King tickets for Sunday afternoon at 4pm. We then bought tickets to a 9pm show on the same night from another hotel. When we went to pick up our tickets, we were told that the 4pm had been cancelled and there was only an 8pm and we hadn't been contacted regarding the change. We were fortunate that Excalibur was able to exchange our tickets for our other show or else we wouldn't have been able to see Lion King at all. Mandalay should have taken the time to contact people who had purchased the 4pm tickets and it's unfortunate that they didn't do that. I'm not one to ask for freebies or anything but they really should have done something for us for the inconvenience they caused.

Problem is that its such a far cry from the rest of Mandalay Bay (and Vegas) that we had a bit of culture shock every time we went to our room.  It was definitely cold and unfriendly compared to the other resorts around.  The rooms are all suites, which seem to be a growing trend in Vegas (according to our numerous cab drivers.)

We got a $40 credit for booking w\/ hotels.com to use on a buffet, but the highlight of our trip was provided by Kristin at the front desk (someone give her a raise, please!)

We were visiting the beach area and when we slid our card through the attendant said our card was expired. We said that's impossible because we checked in that day. We told us maybe there was an error in the system, but unfortunately we had to give up our card and go back to the front desk to get a new one. 

After our beach visit, we went back to the front desk and Kristin helped us. We told her what happened and she was very apologetic even mad that we had been treated like that. We told her it was no big deal, but she said the attendant should have called the front desk to confirm to avoid the inconvenience. After apologizing several times more and asking how our trip was so far, she gave us a $75 credit for our troubles! We were shocked by her generosity and thankful for her care.

We started by booking The Chapel at Mandalay Bay and a giant, 2,000sq foot suite at THEhotel at Mandalay Bay for the reception.  They were one of the only locations in Vegas that seemed totally cool with our plans to throw a big party in one of their suites. The hotel gave us 20% off our rooms and our guest rooms for the wedding - despite the fact that our wedding would occur at such a busy time as St. Patrick's Day, Spring Break, and March Madness.

When we decided to have our wedding dinner at Fleur, we had the pleasure of working with Lisa Cortina of group dining services. She was tirelessly helpful and a total sweetheart in helping us construct such a memorable experience both at dinner and at the reception after. 

The experience:
The wedding went off without a hitch. Our officiant, Rev. Adam Duckro, kept it quick, simple, honest, real and heartfelt, just how we wanted. It. This is Vegas. Our guests didn't come this far to sit through a long ceremony. Also, our guide\/planner (Kaylee or Kaylen I believe) was great too. 

The photographer got some great shots, but more on that in a minute.

Fluer by Hubert Keller was amazing. Sure, it was expensive to do a 6 course tasting menu for 19 people, but each dish impressed, and pleased both the picky palates and the gourmands in our party. So happy to be able to say that my Wedding Dinner was one of the best dinners of my life! Thank you Hubert Keller, Thank you to our great service staff, and Thank you Lisa Cortina! 

Finally the reception. We moved up to one of the ""T-Suites"" located on the 62nd floor of THEhotel. This place was huge. Big enough for a party of 30 or so, but PERFECT for our wedding party of 19. There was a bar, a floor section big enough for a dance floor, a sound system, great decor, couches, tables, and an awesome all-glass direct view of the strip. Our attached bedroom was equally impressive. We didn't staff anyone in the room. A bartender isn't necessary for that small of a party. Guests did have fun taking turns behind the bar ""playing bartender"" though. Pretty sure my step-brother's performance got him laid. The Party was great, as evidenced by security showing up twice to keep it down. However, when my irate and half-drunk aunt called management, explaining the money we'd spent that day, and that this was a wedding party, I'm pretty sure they just to decided to just ignore whatever wet-blanket party poopers would call security at 1AM on a Saturday night, St. Partrick's Day, in Las Vegas. Big ups for calling off the Hounds. Maybe they offered the complainers an Ambien...we will never know. We were too busy raging until about 4:30 AM. 

The whole Mandalay Bay experience was as memorable as could be. Single ladies were overheard saying ""this is how I want to do my wedding"". If I could go back, I wouldn't change a thing.

Points were docked for 3 reasons though, taking it down to 4 stars. The prices for stocking booze in our room and for the various Photography packages were outrageous by any industry standard. I mean OUTRAGEOUS.

Also, when we were having issues getting the audio working for the reception, I was told on the phone, by the audio technician that he wouldn't be coming up to assist me because he was ""a little busy"". Imagine being a groom, being late for your wedding dinner, terrified that your guests will find your reception without music, and hearing those words. I wanted to reach through the phone and strangle him. He did ultimately walk me through it on the phone, but it caused me to be even more late. This probably jacked up our dinner a notch too, as the boozehounds of our group surely sucked down another $15 martini or two while waiting for us to join them. C'est la vie. 

For those curious, the whole experience totaled out at about $6,000 for the day's events. That's obviously pricy for a 19 person wedding, but if you're thinking of ditching The Big Wedding like we did, this is a much funner, cheaper option. Everyone- EVERYONE had a blast.",0,0,0

Mandalay Bay\/MGM Resorts took 4 days before they finally sent the correct itemized receipt via email. The other 3 representatives that I did finally reach after spending anywhere from 9-16 minutes on hold, they kept sending a receipt; however, the attachment would only have my husband's name and Delano header but the document was blank!!!! The resort had invalid charges on the guest receipt, and our credit card was charged erroneously.  It was imperative to speak to someone who could revoke these excessive, invalid, random charges. 

Literally, I was on the phone for 72 minutes, most of which was on hold rather speaking to a person. I was transferred to FOUR, yes 4 different people. Started with accounts receivable, back to guest services, back to AR Manager (I thought), then transferred once more  to another manager, placed on hold for several minutes many different times. Not to mention, I had to 'plead' my case regarding the charges on top of jumping though hoops just to verify the incorrect charges.  

I can't help to believe Mandalay Bay\/MGM Resorts do this on purpose hoping the individual will get frustrated enough and give up. Believe me, I wanted to at several points during this ordeal; however, it became the principle more then about the money.

Psh. I couldn't see sh*t. I could barely see a bit of the strip if I squished my face onto the glass.

I had a good view of the middle of nowhere and a barren airport. Fun. :\/

The pool area was nice tho.
The wave\/tide pool is over-rated since the waves only form every 5 min or so.

The lazy river was nice.

The pools I liked because they were 4 ft deep thus I couldn't drown :D
yay for being considerate to shorties that can't swim.

I saw the musical the Lion King here. The theatrical representation was pretty cool.
But they will jip you on the stale cold popcorn so don't get it!

Oh, and bring your own waters. I got charged 6 bucks for a small bottle of water at the pool area.

The air in the rooms is pretty bad. Smoky and stale. (and I got a non-smoking room)

I usually stay at MGM for work (plus it's cheap), and when I'm vacationing either Encore, Aria, or Pallazo (more expensive but better when I want to enjoy).

However, because of a 2 free night deal, we decided to give Mandalay Bay a shot, and we were pleasantly surprised.

The lobby\/entrance is nice, fresh smelling, and open... which is a trait I love about Wynn\/Encore\/Aria.  The staff were very friendly, and helped us out with everything.  

Casino floor was adequate, dealers were friendly, there were plenty of tables open, and the vibe was nice and relaxed.  I was able to sit down and play for a good 3-4 hours with no problems, save for the occasional drunkard playing 1 hand and then leaving.

There are also a lot of nice restaurants and a nice shopping area... as well as an aquarium.  The aquarium was kind of fun, but I admit I would not go back unless my niece wanted to again (she is 2 years old).  She thoroughly enjoyed the aquatic life, however I thought it was a bit short and not very awe-inspiring.

The coolest thing about this hotel, however, is the pool!  Out of all the pools I've been to in Vegas, this one takes the cake!  The real-sanded beach leading to the wave-pool is the best place to come and relax and enjoy a drink or too.  There's also beach side food to keep you satisfied, and music is just loud enough so you can bob your head yet not get a head-ache.  They also have a beach-side gaming area where you can gamble, I wish I had more time to check that out.  What can get better than gambling by the beach??? Hot cards, hot girls, hot weather, and alcohol... sounds perfect to me!

The rooms were also very nice.  We got a 2 queen bed room, it was nice and spacious and the bathroom was updated as well.  There was also a nice sitting area with a desk for us to prop open our laptops and check e-mails\/etc.  Only bad thing about the room is our carpet felt a little bit damp, hopefully it was people coming from the pool and not something else.... oh well.  Other than that, room seemed fresh and clean... it was a lot nicer than rooms at places like MGM, but a step down from Pallazzo, Aria, Encore... etc.

Overall, this is a great hotel.  For the price, you can't really beat the experience! For something cheaper, go to MGM or something like that, for something more sophisticated, you can give encore\/pallazzo\/cosmo a try.  I would definitely come back here again with my buddies to enjoy the sun!

All in all, would definitely come back here again to enjoy the pool area and what not.",1,1,1

I've never taken my kids to Las Vegas, but this hotel would be on my list for consideration - clean and does not have the 'element' I'd want to shelter them from. 

Aside from having several great restaurants, they have several pools and great activities for kids.  They have a lazy river, and a pool which kicks out waves every minute, or something like that.  During the summer they have a fun concert series pool side, which I've attended, they usually bring in groups that you have heard of, and the admission fee is like $30.  

The room rate was $185 for my trade show, and they have an additional $25 resort fee, which includes internet and the gym fee.  The actual rooms are plenty big, with a big bathroom and two sinks.  The rooms also have two televisions, including one in the bathroom.  Being that I stay here for work, I appreciate that they have a desk and good internet service.  My biggest con, every trip, is the check-in line; it takes between 15-30+ minutes.  For adults looking to have a good time, the property also has a few clubs, and numerous watering holes.  

For those looking to gamble, the casino is HUGE, and the sports book is one of the best in Vegas.  If you are overwhelmed by drink prices, the sports book is a reasonable place to sink a few drinks and watch your favorite team

Lesson: If you're looking for a job in Las Vegas either become a valet at The Hotel, because according to their own management, valeting your car there is like ""giving your car to a stranger""....so therefore valets there are no better than giving your car to a guy on the street and hoping your car and it's contents will be OK.

The toilet is in a separate little room in the bathroom which was kinda scary cuz you kinda feel like you're trapped, but it was good so you don't have to smell it lol.

- Parking is easy.  The self parking and valet parking here is so easy.  The parking garage at the rear of the property has easy access from Frank Sinatra drive or Mandalay Bay Dr.  For locals or tourists it's an easy in\/out.

- Great selection of restaurant choices.  From high end restaurants to cheap eats, there's something for everyone....and it's good food too.

- Lots of bars and lounges.  Everyone can find a place to have a drink and enjoy themselves.....from hipsters to regular joe's, there's something for everyone.

- Decent limits on table games.  You can find $10 min bet blackjack here on occasion.  There's also a good selection of slots and other table games.

- The vibe here is awesome.  I can't explain it, but I always feel good here.  The people and the vibe are always energizing.

- Great entertainment.  The House of Blues and the Mandalay Events Center always has great entertainers in their lineup.

- Walkway to Luxor.  If you want a different experience, you can easily walk to the Luxor via a connecting mall area without going outside.  This is huge during the sweltering Summer months.

We were a large party, no one did anything. We felt almost foolish giving our money away. If you are going to LV to have fun at the slot, change your plans and go to Reno (much more fun).

but my checkout process was the best ever.

my flight was at 7pm and i wanted to workout and chill in the mandalay spa. Ricky who was checking me out was FLAWLESS. Firstly he apologized for the long lines and then he helped me out with getting the spa pass even tho i was checking out. The attitude and work ethic is beyond praise.

and then the finale of my checkout, getting my bag from the baggage department. I had used up all my change the night before (no need to explain how) and I tried to get cash back at the restaurant i ate in the hotel but it was against the policy. I got an unopened drink from the spa and went to get my bag. Jorge handed me my bag swiftly (no wait for tip pauses) and I explained to him I had no change and passed him the drink. He politely declined and said as long he was of service to me, he was glad.

Our first negative experience happened as soon as we got there. The lighting in the parking lot is awful, which makes it difficult to read any signs directing you where to go. It was also difficult to see the number of the space we parked in. When we got off the elevator into the casino, there was no map indicating where we were or how to find the check in desk (I noticed that other hotels have maps everywhere, Mandalay should think about adding some). We had to ask random people until we got there. 
       When we checked in the woman was not very friendly and left us with very little information about the hotel. Also, they charge your card double with one of those payments as ""pending"". We called today and apparently they remove it within 3-5 business days, but it would have been nice to be informed of this while we were checking in. 
       We finally got to our room, it was supposed to be non smoking. It was obvious that the previous guests didn't treat it that way, it reeked of cigarettes and weed. I called the front desk and they offered us an air freshener...I asked for a different room instead, which I was really pleased they agreed to. When we got to the new room it was really nice, and it helped to soften our rough initial experience. However, the hallways were lined with empty boxes of beer and half eaten room service trays. The elevators also had greasy handprints smeared all over them (some were impressively high). Overall, we were pretty disappointed. I think it is worth saving the extra cash for some of the other hotels who take their business and their customers more seriously.

Not sure where to begin?

The Casino
The Restaurants
The Bar
The Shops
The Sports Center (Place your bets here)

The Casino is open 24 hours a day.  Black Jack, Poker are available at certain times only.
The various restaurants are open for Breakfast, Lunch \/ Brunch and or Dinner and some open Late Night.
The convenient necessity shop should you need a razor, nail clipper, snacks or something along those lines.
The clothes shops....There are a few specialty shops to get some clothes....These shops will dress you up nice and totally pimp you out!!
The Sports Center.....Got a favorite sports team....want to place a bet....do it here.
The Restaurant.....take a stroll around and see what you like...sorry food on this trip for me was just a convenience....not my focus of attention.
The Bars and Lounge area......at night they have live band singing with light dancing.
The Movies......Feel free to catch a movie or a show.

So basically this hotels got it all.  There are more to do outside of the Mandalay Bay.  There is a Tram that takes you to the Luxor and to Excalibur.

There is a Car Rental company (Avis) on site should you need a car.  If your staying on the strip it might be better to cab it.  Limo's are reasonable for large groups.

What else can I say?

The best part of my room was the showers.
They have the ""High Presure Shower Heads"" which are fantastic.  It will knock your socks off and make you feel so refresh in minutes.  If only Jerry and Kramer had this:

I have never stayed at Mandalay Bay...previously stayed at the Bellagio and Encore, both amazing.  I had heard the pool at Mandalay was great and was excited to try it out.  

The hotel was way to large for my taste, everywhere we turned it was completely packed with people, huge lines, long waits for everything.  I had been dreaming of relaxing by the pool to read a book on this rare weekend without my young kids.  Impossible, no chairs, all the chairs had towels and the staff doesn't have any policy of removing towels if the chair remains unoccupied we had to sit on the ground on a towel.  Also the whole thing had an air of a busy water park including turn style entry with security bag screening.  We were able to use the Delano pool  the 2nd day and we were happy to find two chairs under an umbrella to finally relax my friend and I said ""This is what we were dreaming of"".  30 minutes in we were told umbrellas were a $200 luxury and in an embarrassing interaction we were asked to get out of the chairs that were not marked as reserved and apart from the umbrellas to the side, looked exactly like all the other chairs.  So on this huge concrete pool deck, in 90+ degree heat has no ""free"" shade.  I felt nickeled and dimed for items that would be provided free and out of comfort, consideration and safety at other hotels.

In addition to this, most of the staff I encountered seemed frazzled, rushed and unhappy with their jobs (not including the M Life staff who were all very helpful).  Even the spa staff seemed really mad, annoyed and unfriendly, not the peaceful pampering experience you expect at a spa.  I will stick to the Bellagio and Encore\/Wynn from now on where you feel valued.",4,3,2

(And when I asked the woman if the coupon code went through, the one from Retailmenot, she said she had no idea what I was talking about, she didn't even ask if I had any more information...basically disregarded what I was asking her.) 

They gave us two beds instead of one, even though we booked it ahead of time, the rude woman at the desk told us to read the tiny fine print when we book - its never a guarantee. WOW.

Fail. (Her foul attitude definitely made our debate of whether we should stay longer or not - a big not.)


Finding the parking sucks, its all the way around the back of the hotel, its not obvious. 

No one was helpful or even polite. Oh, and when we double checked to see if we could get a room with a view of the Strip, it was a room facing the end of the Strip (barely) and because the way the hotel is shaped, we had a view of the other side of the hotel building. GEE, thanks. (It was like a slap in the face...I was too scared to ask for an extra pillow after that.)

The rooms have paper thin walls, so if you're okay listening to Las Vegas late night partying and grunting noise, this hotel will do. 

Before I forget, they have this really confusing do not disturb sign that basically means the same thing, but I wasn't sure if they were trying to be clever - please just be clear...NOT clever. UGH.

When I called for guest services, the hold\/wait time was about 5mins, they didn't even have speaker phone so I had to listen to the lousy wait messages...definitely not something I want to be doing on a ""vacation"". 

I'm guessing you have to be a BIG spender to really enjoy the rooms at this particular hotel. 

Don't eat at the seafood buffet, the crab legs were a joke, the mussels were dry, all the other foods were mediocre and the dessert options were for the tastebudless. SO GROSS, and it was over $30 each. Save your money and your stomach. 

To be fair, maybe the food are for people who have a hangover? I don't drink alcohol or smoke, so I do taste everything...and can taste terrible food...so really, if you drink alcohol or smoke eating here may be a good idea?

Okay, obviously I didn't enjoy the room or the food here, but I did enjoy the pool area (before 6p). The pools are more fun here than some of the other hotels, but they CLOSE SO EARLY! Why would you close your pool area so early in a city that is over 100 degrees? I don't know how hotels and their pool areas are run, but if you are taking suggestions, please, keep your pools open later, at least during these crazy summer hours. 

Don't forget to bring your own inner tube for the lazy river - if you don't want to pay over $19 for one SMALL one. Yes, that's right, over $19 for ONE SMALL INNER TUBE that you can ONLY use in the LAZY RIVER. UGH! I kinda understand, they need to make money where they can, but still - do they feel good about this?

P.S. When I was hanging out, floating along the lazy river, some kid had a bloody nose dribbling down his chin, trying to get to the stairs and the lifeguard near him was too busy looking for his sunglasses that fell into the water. I was trying to yell out, ""There's a boy with a bloody nose, think he needs help."" Nothing, no response. Luckily, the kid walked out of the water and walked to find whomever he was with. UGH, gross.

UGH I feel sick just thinking about it again. Anyway. They also have a wave pool, but again, this ain't Raging Waters, so don't expect it. Waves come like every five to ten mins? I don't remember the exact interval of wave action, but when it did come around - IT, being only one silly hump of a wave, it was rare & came & left. Like it never even happened. 

Anyway, this hotel was only worth the stay because of the (barely given) discount and pool area.  But even then, they get ya with all the extra fees, AAALLL the FEES! 

I'd only come back because of the cool pools, maybe. MAYBE.

And when you want to check out, the lines, yes, the lines, are long as heck. Then you have this person trying to get people to express check out - no way! I want to make sure that all of the FEES you guys are going to be charging me are legit! So if you have to check out at a certain time, make sure you give yourself, errr, give them at least 30mins before that because of the LIIIIINES!!! 

Lines at check out!!!! Unheard of.

While checking in at Mandalay (for a regular room), I was asked if I'd stayed at the hotel before. ""Yes, but it's been 10 years."" You see I visit Vegas often but usually stay with family or friends.

For whatever reason, Lady Luck was on my side that day, because I got upgraded to a suite with a Strip view. You know, the kind reserved for high rollers, not for people like me who bring a mini Snickers in their purse and look forward to eating in bed.

All the way at the end of the hall, two door entrance and a mini dining area as you walk inside. To the right, a four-seat lounge and wet bar, followed by a kind bedroom and bath. To the left was a sectional sofa living room and queen suite. It was ridiculous in all the best ways, including tv's inside the bathroom mirrors.

Mandalay guests have access to The Beach, another perk on a sunny, pre-Memorial Day visit. Stopped in for a few minutes to catch some rays before heading off to meetings. I can only imagine what it's like on a weekend.

As with most things in life, all good things must come to an end. Though I'd like to have lingered in that gorgeous room longer, it was time to halt the charade and get back to my d-list existence. But that's what Vegas is all about, right? Getting to play grown up pretend on vacation.

They barely were able to get 1 table of players at 10 AM on the Saturday I played...which shows people already know not to play poker tournaments here.

But here is what was awful.

We all started with 4500 chips.

These two Chinese brothers sat down, they spoke English, but were talking across the table in Mandarin (which shouldn't be allowed and at most casinos the pit boss would call out). 

On the first hand 

brother A raised 2000 chips before the flop...everyone folds but his brother who calls (when the blinds were 25\/50.

At the flop Brother A raised 2000 again , his brother called.

At the turn Brother A raised again, his brother folded.

So we never got to see any cards and now they have managed to stack 1 brother with almost double the starting chips in the first hand.

Afterwards the brother who won laughed and said in English that his brother won the night before...almost bragging like ""Yesterday was his turn today is mine to cheat and win.""

This was clear collusion and cross table talking in a foreign language, but the dealer nor the pit boss (who barely spoke English) called this bullshit out.

I told this story at my next tournament at Green Valley and everyone agreed that table talk in anything other than English is usually strictly prohibited and that this did seem like collusion since we never saw the cards and the raises were so large on the 1st hand.

In the later hands the Brother who won did not continue with 2000 chip raises and played much more in line with the blinds, but he definitely took the chip lead by all but knocking his brother out.

The double sinks were nice, but obviously the TV in the bathroom with the luxurious bathtub was amazing-even in their cheapy rooms!  I made good use of that fantastic tub more than once on my stay.

Pools: Obviously, the big draw for this place.  I went on the Monday morning of Memorial Day weekend and basically turned around and walked out. The place was packed shoulder to shoulder, was way too scenester for my taste, and overall was a total bust.

Like most things in vegas, prices are high. Food is good if you eat at one of the higher end restaurants, but pricey.

Pool area was packed (summer vacation time I guess). Courtesy goes out the window here...people just climbing all over the place. Wave pool was closed twice due to ""biohazard"" the day we went. Since you have to be 4 ft tall to enter, I don't know what that means. Drunken incontinence?

Spa was average for amenities and service.

Comps are tight. Not sure that is true at other non-MGM casinos these days. Drink service was slow most of the time. Not like the ""old"" days (10+ years ago) :-)

Bars were ok, except eyecandy that added the tip, hid in on the folded check and didn't say anything about it. This p*ssed me off more than anything.

Rooms are dated and need repair and renovation. Half the lights in our suite didn't work. After 13 years, the suites are showing their age.

Most the of the staff were cordial and helpful. Service at Raffles was slow at times, and not too cheery.

Did notice lines for check-in right around normal check-in time but we arrived early and avoided that. Yes, there is a wait for the elevators, especially at check-in and out (doesn't anyone use the the bell man any more?), and at pool closing time (watch out for all the inner tubes and sweaty shirtless guys).

Being down at the end of the strip is ok, unless you want to be able walk to several hotels, etc. You do get alot of plane and helicopter traffic but you only hear it outside.

Not the worst place....i'm sure there are better.

Also, find out what conventions etc are there. That affects the crowds and clientele.",6,0,0

I originally booked only a two night stay, but found out later we could stay an extra night. Since I booked the room through their website I called to see if I could just add the night. Unfortunately they didn't have the same kind of room available, but recommended booking the room through a 3rd party site since they saved blocks then call back and they would be able to join the 2 reservations. It sounds complicated, but it was super easy, since when I called back they just looked up both. 

Since this was a romantic trip I talked with the concierge and they set me up with a rose petals and tea lights for the bed and bathtub. (Yeah, corny, but hey, why not!) 

When we checked in on Thursday night the front desk assistant, Edwin, informed me that he was able to upgrade the room for us free of charge. Amazing, but I wondered if the petals would be there since it was a spur of the moment thing. Turns out that the room they upgraded us to was a penthouse suite with a gorgeous view and was HUGE. Also, the roses and tea lights were all set up when we walked in. 

Before you say that this 5 stars is because I was bribed with a free amazing upgrade (which I totally get and I totally would) let me say that it isn't. The room was amazing. Immaculately clean, comfy robes, the most amazing bed I've ever slept in etc. That's not the reason for the 5 stars. The main reason is for the service. Everyone we interacted with during our stay were beyond incredible! From the bubbly Valet who took our car at 11pm on a Thursday, to Edwin at the front desk, to our fantastic cleaning service who always greeted us with a smile and asking if we needed anything when we ran into them in the hall. (Special shout out to the floor lead, Natalya(?) who laid out our things so nicely every afternoon and took the time to thank us for staying and wishing us a happy journey even after we were obviously checked out, so she didn't have to. Such a great woman!)

The room wreaked of cigarettes and pot. Pillows and chaise lounge were stained. The jetted bath tub was dirty and the furniture was damaged. The TV in the bathroom was broken and the shower light was out. A couple of the complimentary toiletries were in dirty boxes. It stands to reason that if management can appoint staff to strip the floors and shampoo the carpets on the casino level Tuesday evenings, surely they could do some maintenance upstairs. At least re-face the tub!

Valet was either full or understaffed. I couldn't tell which, but I couldn't get any service, either. 

The wait time at check-in\/out was frustrating. I waited in line over 40 minutes when I went to check out, and had a similar experience to Tim B (someone was checked into the room before I checked out, and they gave me a big-time hassle about getting a new room key to retrieve my belongings).

Both wi-fi and wired internet were painfully slow.

The reasons I'm giving this place two stars despite my last atrocious experience:

*The location! 

*Great floor plan. Casinos, shopping, and restaurant areas have a really open feel and aren't as smokey as other hotels.

*Awesome entertainment. Especially if you like has-been 80s music as much as I do! 

*Beautiful views to be had if you book the right room. Even the rooms with small windows and poor views are okay if they're near the elevators. Less walking=a major bonus after perusing the 100-degree parking garage.",1,0,0

Room service is decent. I'd definitely love the eggs benedict with (real) crab. Chicken wings are very good as well. Large and meaty.

Pool: very family oriented so if you are looking for single people to meet, don't come here. There is a 21 over pool where women can go topless but it's way too expensive and I don't think many people come here.

Casino: Not bad but tables normally aren't under $10 during a slow weekday. 

Buffet: okay but not great. Not a lot of choices but then again in Vegas meals can get pretty pricey really quick. So $25, ain't that bad.

Cons: long lines when checking in or out.

3.they have some good restaurants border grill & house of blues had really good food.

1.the overall inside hotel is nice until you get to the casino where it smells like old people & smoke 
2. The room we stayed in was not great the carpet was dingy,everything just looked so old like it was there from the begging of time so glad they are renovating
3.they literally charge you everything which is ridiculous paying over $1,000 for a suite you would expect some free buffet vouchers or something but no nothing, they charged us to use a mini fridge which I didn't even know there was a charge because nobody said anything, some lights in the room didn't work,towels at the pool where disgusting some had stains I mean c'mon people if you have all that money to renovate I know you can afford new towels, $14 daiquiri, windows were dirty. Overall I expect better from a hotel that claims itself as 4-5 stars & can't even give guests a great visit making them pay extra for things that you can easily get free at other hotels but they don't care it's all about money so next time I will be staying elsewhere where I'm treated better for what I pay.",1,1,1

This hotel is beautiful.  The air has a nice sweet,clean smell when you first walk in.  The standard rooms are spacious, clean and luxurious.  We had a room that faced their famous pool...there are 2 closets, 2 sinks in the bathroom, a shower and a separate bathtub.  The toilet is in it's own little separated section of the bathroom so you can close it off and someone else can use the vanity sink area.  The bed was sooo comfortable and the pillows nice and fluffy and linens were soft, clean and comfy.  If you are all about hanging out by a pool, this is the hotel for you.  There is a wave pool and a beachy, sand area where all the lounge chairs are.  Get there early as the lounge chairs are taken up pretty quickly!  The pool area has a great vibe and good music.  There's a poolside grill restaurant which we took advantage of on the day we didn't want to leave the pool area to grab lunch.  The smell of the burgers while you're out in the wave pool will most likely tempt you to stop by at some point!  There's another pool area which is topless and you have to pay cover to get in but the music in that area sounds cool.  Because the pool area is pretty popular they swipe in every person's room key card so make sure each of your guests staying at the hotel bring down their key to the pool.  There's a bunch of good restaurants that you should try if you are staying there or not....Burger Bar which is in the Mandalay Bay Place is a must!  The Kobe beef burger is heavenly.  The Rum Jungle is a brazilian steak house that turns into a club at night with glow in the dark go go dancers dancing and swinging above you.  If you go there for dinner try the skirt steak.  The only downfall on the Mandalay Bay is the location...it is located on the south strip...it's the last hotel on the south part of the strip so unless this is your first visit and you want to be more centralized so you can walk around and explore the strip, you might want to stay at this hotel during your return trips back.

Mandalay has many restaurant options, an aquarium, shopping, and is connected to Luxor (which has ours own varieties of the same options as Mandalay.

I ended up booking a 3 night stay at one of their hotel suites.  The suite itself was very nice, it was the extra Bedroom suite (X2 Suite). I know it is not the coolest thing to do, but we did bring our in-laws along for the trip (can we say built in childcare, thanks yeh yeh and ma ma) and rather than get two rooms and pay double the ""resort fee"" we decided to get one large 1450 sq ft two bedroom suite.  Money well spent!  The rates were awesome for the suite though as I received their special promo rate of 20% off the entire suite.  I looked at other suites this size closer to Bellagio and they were easily double the price.  At the end, we only spent what would have broken down to $120 per room per night (assuming we had bought two separate rooms) and just one resort fee.  So the value was definitely there!.  So, here's there review of the hotel itself:

Upon check-in, I was rather annoyed as the lines were massively long.  However, it was a nice touch that they handed out free bottles of water for us to drink while standing in line b\/c it was rather hot having just unloaded some of our baggage and that was a really nice touch.  The line moved fairly quickly and it wasn't as bad as it appeared.  We checked into our hotel suite on the 15th floor and we had the  gorgeous view of the strip and Luxor.  The windows spanned ceiling to floor and gave us a panoramic view of the strip. The curtains could be opened with a touch of a button.  There was a flat screen tv in the common living area, each bedroom and one in each bathroom!  The bathrooms were well appointed, double sinks, massive massaging soaking tub and clear glass showers with a separate enclosed space for the toilet.  Overall, the hotel room was nice with a couple of flaws:  1. In the room we stayed in, the curtain in the left side would not close b\/c it fell off the hinge that powered it to open and close.  NOt a big deal and we could have called maintenance to have it repaired, but it didn't bother us enough.  2. In the room we stayed in, the vent in our bathroom didn't work.  Other than that, there are no complaints about the suite itself.  

I saw there were a lot of complaints about the slow elevators but they must have added more elevators b\/c they were fast and we never had to wait longer than a minute to access one.  

One of the main reasons why we wanted to stay here was to have access to their swimming facilities.  We had to think about what we can do in vegas with a toddler.  We really enjoyed the lazy river and their swimming pools.  While we wanted to check out their wave pool our son was not over 48"" tall so he couldn't go in yet.  I can see how the pool area can get pretty crowded fast, so the best time to go is early in the morning to grab yourself a lawn chair and swim before it gets over crowded.  

There's something about the casino itself that isn't enjoyable to gamble.  Limited selection of games and the players and dealers aren't the friendliest.  Not my first choice for a place I'd like to gamble at.  It may just be that I also lost money here. 

I was very surprised at how busy this south end of the strip could be.  I thought maybe since this was an older hotel that it wouldn't have good business. Boy was I wrong, this area is pretty happening too. Not as crowded as the main part of the strip, but definitely busy.  There are shops and many restaurants to choose from.  We wouldn't hesitate staying here again.  

The only other gripe I had about this place is that I wanted to extend our stay for one more night, but their computer\/reservations system was down for more than 24 hours and it was pretty annoying that I had to call multiple times before someone finally just told me that they were sold out anyway and we wouldn't be able to extend our stay.",2,0,0

It's a solid 3.5 star mega resort, one of the first on the strip, still has plenty to offer - anyone can stay here (families, singles, couples) and it works.  The tacking on of extra fees for everything (all MGM properties) are a big hassle, not welcome development in Las Vegas pricing policies.  Parking is a hassle.

My husband and I stayed here at least twice a year.  We loved the pool area, loved the spa and the rooms were very nice.  However, after staying there this last weekend, our view of this hotel has changed.  First of all, the rooms are definitely showing signs of wear & tear...a renovation is seriously needed.  The pool & beach area used to be a calm and relaxing place to lounge is now busy and packed with people.  There were no lounge chairs available and every chair there was about an inch apart from each other.  In addition, the pool area now seems to be more of a party atmosphere, with loud music, rather than the relaxing feel.  The spa facility is still very nice and very relaxing...however, it is now very busy, especially later in the day.  So I recommend coming to the spa early in the morning if you want to relax with less people around.  Lastly, the casino is pretty dead.

During the & days we stayed there we used the pool almost every day.
It opens at 8am and we usually made it there anywhere between 10am and noon and we had no problems finding room to sit. ( we went September 5-11) so maybe it gets more crowded during the summer time. 
The lazy river was my favorite and even though we had to buy our tube for $25 it was well worth it.
Everything inside the hotel is very pricey (the only reason we could afford staying here was because of a promotion they were running on line).
It seemed like other hotels, clubs and restaurants in Vegas were offering good deals. But we could barely find any deals for Mandalay Bay. 
We got a coupon book from the Concierge desk that had a coupon for House of Blues at Mandalay Bay (2-1 Breakfast)

We were given a corner room right near the outdoor elevators that ran so loud I couldn't sleep.

Uh, no late checkout for me! But, the most frustrating experience was finding a belonging from a previous guest that I found in the safe. I called the owner who had already asked the front desk if someone would look for the item (and {{why}} wouldn't Mandalay check the safe?)  and I arranged with the owner to leave the item at the front desk. With the mass-exodus of the hotel at 11:00 with the remodel I didn't want to wait in the line to turn in the item and checkout, so I handed it to a conceirge. She rolled her eyes at me and said ""Now I have to walk this over to the front desk"". Excuse me? Isn't the Concierge full service? http:\/\/www.mandalaybay.com\/features-and-shopping\/concierge\/.

This was my first time staying at Mandalay Bay and only chose it because I got the room for $99 that night.  Mandalay Bay is usually too far away from the action of the strip in my opinion, but being that we wanted to relax, this place suited us just fine.

It was a standard clean, double-bed room, but the bathroom is pretty spacious (see pics).  I was able to stretch out in the tub pretty comfortably and soak my weariness away.  

We dined at China Grill that night and the food was...too salty, to put it mildly.  I'll review the restaurant another time, but if you're curious, I give it 2 stars.

The mini-bar is motion-sensor activated, so be careful about removing items from there...even for a few seconds.  Don't be tempted to grab something from there, unless you have money to burn (see pics).  

Although we initially planned to visit their nightclub, Mix Lounge, we were no longer in the mood after the terrible dinner.  Plus, the place felt ""dead"" overall -  no high energy atmosphere typical for happening hotels such as the Venetian, Encore, or Cosmopolitan.  We ended up switching from nightclub attire to comfy clothes more suited for playing slots and poker.  ;-P

The dining options are larger here than other hotels, and there is also a food court when you want to save money on the expensive Vegas strip dining options. You can stay in the hotel area with lots of things to do, since it is actually 3 hotels connected to each other, Mandalay Bay, Four Seasons Las Vegas and the Delano. There is a excellent aquarium in the hotel called Shark Reek, and its excellent for kids. The pools here are so big with its own beach, lazy river and more. 

I recommend two restaurants here, the MIX at the Delano - 62 floors above the strip, and Veranda in the Four Seasons Las Vegas. Bayside Buffet was okay, at least its cheaper than most other buffet's on the strip, but they need to upgrade their dessert options. 

Its at the end of the strip, so it does take traveling to get to places. There is a free train that will take you to Excaliber and Luxor nearby. I used taxi's a lot, and it will probably be $15 - $22, including tip, to take you to where you want to go on the Strip. So that is the down side of this hotel.

I have never experienced nothing like it. I traveled to Las Vegas from San Diego for my 22nd Birthday. I had friends travel with me and some friends and family meeting us there. I spent 700$ for my room for the weekend and also booked a cabana for one of the 3 days I was visiting. my cabana totaled to be about 500$. With that being said we clearly planned on spending the day at the pool. I received a confirmation for my cabana via email for Sat March 16th charges have been made and I thought I was all set to go. I get to the cabana reservation around 12pm on Saturday and for some reason my name is not on the list. The people working at cabana reservations all had a blank look on their face as if they had no idea what happened and why my name was not on their list. They said they could not do anything for me and asked me to see concierge. I waited in line to speak to someone at concierge for about 30 mins, by this time its 2:30pm in the afternoon and my relaxing day at the cabana with my friends and family went completely downhill. No one could give me answers as to why my name is not on the list however its stated on my bank statement ""Mandalay Bay Cabana"" -500$. They researched it and eventually found out that some how my reservation was made for the previous Monday in which I was not in town and MY CONFIRMATION CLEARLY SAYS SATURDAY MARCH 16TH 2013!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

The only thing they were going to comp me was the cabana for Sunday and some food and beverage comp. This is not how we planned our trip on our 3 day stay in Vegas. I had everything organized so I did not want to cancel my plans on Sunday to go to the pool when those were my Saturday plans. 

Since then I have spoke to a few wise people who visit Vegas quite a bit and they told me that if I don't go to the pool first thing in the morning to ""hold"" my already paid for reservation, then they will give it to some ""high roller"" that just walks up and asks to purchase a cabana. why? because they probably bump the price up and sell it right on the spot!

They also charge for every little thing! I called room service to bring up some extra glasses and a knife to cut some limes for cocktails and they charged me 1$ for each utensil.

I knew this hotel would definitely live up to my expectations! We came here during the weekend of spring break so I thought it would take us forever to check in. I was wrong! The check in was fast, efficient and easy! We went up to our room on the 24th floor and the room number was our our anniversary date (how did this even happen? loved it!) This hotel is truly amazing - it's clean, decorative and wonderful! 

You also get a free drink ticket at check in - but it's only for wells, domestic beer\/wine. 

We also got the room which with the view of the pools. I'm pretty sure Mandalay Bay has the BEST pool on the strip!

The bathrooms were super clean and the bed was very comfy. Besides the bed, there was also several couches, huge closet, and numerous drawers to put your clothes in! There's also a little safe box to put your belongings in. It's fairly tiny, your laptop wouldn't fit in there! There's a huge TV in the bedroom and mini tv in the bathroom.

Some mornings, we stayed in so we would put ""relaxing"" on the door knob. And the maids do pay attention and they will not knock or come into the room to clean. Unlike other hotels, even if you leave a little bit later in the day to go on the strip - they still make time to come in and clean the room!

We needed extra soap bars, so we called the service desk. We requested a soap bar and they were at our door within 15 minutes. Super sweet customer service!

One star off because they seriously stuff the fridge to the point where you're unable to put anything in there! We bought some vitamin water\/fruit to put inside the fridge and pulled several beverages out. We were going to put back the beverages inside the fridge on the last day. Well, the maids decided to charge us for all the beverages we pulled out even though we didn't even drink any of it! And they also took our food out and replaced the beverages. I was beyond pissed about this one. Anyway, we told the check out rep. that those charges were invalid since we never drank any of those beverages. The rep was civil about it and voided the charges.

FYI: There is a $20 resort fee for each day you stay here.

But besides that, I really enjoyed my stay here!

The casino is kind of dead. It's very family oriented, so I rather gamble further up the strip.

Also, I think there's only ONE cafe that's open 24hrs for food unlike the hotels on the mid-strip.  I wish they had a lot more restaurants open for those who are hungry at 2AM!

Also, it's pretty much the last hotel on the south strip. It's far from everything but it isn't really Mandalay Beach's fault. So if you stay here, be prepare to take the tram\/bus.

As much as I loved staying here, I think the next time I visit Vegas, I will try to find a hotel much closer to the mid strip.

Also, they have LION KING playing here! :D",1,0,0

First off, we paid to upgrade to a Delano suite. I wouldn't do that again. It was a nightmare getting to our room before or after the MJ Show. It's VERY far from the Beach, and there was NO complimentary coffee in the room. Who pays over $200 a night to stay in a room with $4 a cup coffee that has powdered creamer. That was terrible. Also terrible was the one hour fifteen minute wait time to check in. That has never happened to me in Las Vegas before and when you don't allow people in their room until 4, but pools close at 8, getting to your room at 6 is unreasonable. Additionally, the old room service cart next door to our room was left there for over 24 hours. It was disgusting. The most frustrating part was that we were told on the phone that upon showing an offer from the Wynn at checkin, the Mandalay Bay would match their promotion by giving us two buffets per day per person, rather than just a total of two. However, after waiting to check in we were bounced from check in to m life and back while everyone blamed everyone else and never gave us the correct offer. Instead, gave us limited use buffets which left is having to check out without being able to use them all. All in all, very disappointing service from what we used to consider one of our favorite premiere Las Vegas hotels. I feel you used bait and switch tactics to convince us to book you rather than a competitor and we really ended up regretting it. We will not stay here again and left our m life cards in our room at check out.",0,2,0

They are charging you a ""resort fee"", so the internet should always be working. If you put on the do not disturb sign on the door, don't expect housekeeping to care. They came into the room to ""clean up"" while we were out & took the sign with them. Don't expect a view from your window unless you've paid for one. The hotel has some stores & restaurants.

The only thing I had to complain about was the price for room service because I ended up paying $78 for 2 orders of eggs Benedict, lol.

Mandalay Bay was a big deal BACK IN THE DAY, and you can tell. It's one of those giaganto resorts that were popular in the 90s. It's way too big! Getting lost each morning is pretty much de rigueur around there. 

Checking in while in the beginning stages of a newly-acquired Plane Cold, all I wanted was a bed. Which I got. Just a bed. No comforter. No blankets. Not sure where they were. The sheets were dirty, like housekeeping just remade the bed after the last person checked out. When I called to ask for new sheets and a BLANKET they did not understand what I was asking for. They finally sent someone up with a threadbare fleece blanket and I got to practice my lackluster Spanish (nuevo...sheets -insert lots of gestures here-... por favor?) and I still have no idea if I ever got new sheets. I just got to the point where I didn't care. 

Sickness meant a lot of hanging out in the room. So, the view was phenomenal (of the beach and pool area) and the bathroom was neat (toilet in its own little room and two sinks!) but there was a minibar. I HATE minibars. Does anyone even use them anymore? Remove the minibar and just leave me an empty fridge to use. Also- When did hotels stop having in-room coffee makers? I can't manage a trip down in the elevator to get coffee UNTIL I've had my coffee. ugh.

I did order room service, which was the highlight of the trip. The woman on the phone figured out I was sick (hacking and coughing is a dead giveaway) and immediately added all kinds of stuff to my order, which SHE DID NOT CHARGE ME FOR. I nearly cried. Hot water, lemons, saltines, honey, salty chips, tea.... It was so nice. So she earned a star on her own just for taking care of me. 

The rest of the property was just so so. I like the places farther up the strip better.",8,3,3

The room is clean, spacious and most importantly comfortable!!!! I understand that for a lot of people the room really don't matter much but for me it does. I spend some downtime in the there and during that time I like to be comfortable. So for me the room does matter. My first impression of the room is that it was nice and I'm getting a good value for the money. 

Ok when I got here it was around 5:00 and I dreaded checking in. I had a huge headache and I was feeling pretty tired cause I've been nonstop all day even before getting a plane to Vegas. All I wanted was to get the room, take a shower and relax for a bit. Well to my amazement there was literally no line. Normally at this time check in is a zoo. I was checked in quickly and was in the room in no time. 

When I got to the room I put my stuff away and was excited because the bathtub looked very inviting and bubble bath sounded like the next best thing to heaven and believe me it was. That bath is perfect for just soaking in. They also have a TV in the bathroom so you can soak and watch which is what I did. Then I rinsed off in the shower and washed my hair and the shower was amazing too. Five stars for that. 

As far as convince of the room goes there's a lot of outlets which is good. One disappointment is I normally like to try room service at least once and the day I fly in is usually perfect cause I usually don't feel like running around looking for a restaurant. I find their room service menu and find the crappiest room service menu ever. There's no variety for dinner at all. A burger, a salmon dish, and some flatbreads where all they had. Most room service has lots of variety. This was a joke so I skipped that. That's my only gripe though and it's not enough to deduct a star. They made up for it in comfort.

The bed was very comfortable. The blankets were soft and the pillows were comfy. I slept great every night! The only thing about this hotel is the walls are VERY thin. If someone is in the room next to you you will hear everything and they don;t have to be loud for you to hear it all too well. They can be a little annoying but you get used to it. In only had someone in the room next to mine the first and last night I was there so I was lucky. 

There is a little 24 hour convenience shop right by the elevators so it is great for any toiletries or snacks or really anything you might need. I love having one of those near by cause they come in handy. The casino is great as well. They have alot of slot machines to chose from and plenty of playing tables with varying limits. The cocktail waitresses make their rounds often so you do not find yourself waiting forever to get a drink. There are also plenty of restaurants and bars so you don't have to venture far to get to what you need. 

I did express checkout via text so nothing to it. they have alot of express checkout options. The WiFi and TV went out for a few hours one night and they refunded me my resort fee for the day for the inconvenience which I felt was a nice gesture. 

Overall I really really enjoyed my stay here. Everything from the room to the restaurants to the casino was all great. This is at the top of my list of favorites and I will definitely be back. Every place is going to have their pros and cons and to me the cons were minimal at this place. Not enough to effect their rating.",7,0,1

I've been here for Shark Reef a couple of times and also for conferences.  I've also just gone to hang out with friends visiting from out of town.

I'm not sure who is in charge of Campaign ""Brown-nose"" based on these reviews, but I'd like to meet them and share my experience. We booked a two-bedroom suite THROUGH the hotel, and we got treated like we had haggled them down over a discount website. If you're going to spend at least $600 bucks for one night on a suite, DON'T DO IT HERE! Here's what to expect:

1) You're not checking in early. We got there at 10:15AM and weren't even allowed to step into line until 11. There was even a man shooing people out of the lines if he thought they were trying to check in. 

2) You'll be lied to. When we finally were allowed to check in, we were told they didn't have a room BUT would call us when they were ready, which would be in about an hour. Nearly three hours later, we're wondering what the hell is going on, so we call up from the pool. ""Oh it's ready"". When I asked 'snotty dbag' at the front why no one called us to let us know, he said ""sometimes things just get backed up."" There was no apology. Look, if I was staying at the Motel 6 across the street, maybe I would expect that kind of an excuse. But not with a $600 price tag, especially if we checked in right at 11AM.

3) You'll wish you'd stayed somewhere else. Towels scratchier than a brillo pad (from too much bleaching) and an awkward narrow suite that capped off one of Mandalay Bay's long hallways plus small showers and smaller uncomfortable furniture equals waste o' money.

4) You'll have to do everything yourself. Look, I'm a big DIYer, but when I come to Vegas for the works, I want a few things taken care of. Bags being brought up? No, you have to go to the bell desk for that, after you've already been over there once. Mini-bar unlocked? No. Call down. No, we need your credit card. You have my credit card! No, call the front desk. Hi front desk...No, we need a new one, and you can't do it over the phone, come down to the front desk. (me hanging up in exasperated manner) Someone dropped a glass? Great, NOBODY MOVE! It'll be 45 minutes before a guy comes up with a broom and dustpan. Super, like I couldn't have done that. Glass shards were still the floor the next day. The next day, electronic check-out on your TV? Call down to access. Is nothing in this hotel one step?! Move over US Government, it's bureaucracy on a whole new level.

Why do I feel like there was some kind of management coup that had just taken place before the weekend hit? 

The ONLY reason this hotel gets 2 stars is because they have a nice pool and the Shark Reef is one of the coolest things to visit in Vegas - tourists who are certified divers are actually allowed to dive with the sharks! Now only if the rest of the hotel would step it up. Until that day, I'll try any other place before going back here. Newsflash, just because your hotel is golden, it doesn't mean you are.",10,7,5

Check-in is quick and easy even during a huge convention. Same goes for check out - they had a girl with an iPad working her way through the line to assist in getting people out even faster.

As for the lobby area and such, it was a little less than what you experience at, say, Bellagio or Venetian, but still nice and impressive. The casino itself seemed smaller to me than some of the other big hotels, but they still have all the tables and machines that you would want.

Rooms are nice, I especially liked the double sinks so that the BF and I both had our own little space. Also, the actual toilet was in the back of the bathroom with its own door which means someone can be getting ready and you can still have privacy or if you are staying with friends you can close both doors and have even more privacy. Also, there was a makeup mirror attached to the wall for ease of putting on makeup - it could have been lighted but it still worked well. ALSO there was a huge tub in the bathroom too...not that I had time to be soaking in the tub, but it was nice to have the option. Flat screen TV was standard. Black out curtains were present and are, of course, a Vegas MUST. Beds were fairly comfy.

Mini bar options were OK. Coffee is gonna run you $4.50 which at first was like OMG WTF no free coffee? But then, when I weighed getting dressed and going to the lobby to get coffee there and then coming back to the room against that $4.50...I totally paid that $4.50. To me, the prices for the items in the mini bar were NOT unreasonable or out of line with buying it in the convenience shop downstairs. So we definitely used it for water and whatnot.

Food options are plentiful back on the way to the convention center, but if there's a convention going on you can forget eating there without a long wait. The shopping center attached was just...ok. But Hubert Keller has two restaurants here so that alone is bomb ass. They also have the House of Blues and the Foundation Room for entertainment plus a pretty cool bar in the middle of the casino. Getting a Lyft from here is easy, but know to go downstairs to catch it. This can be confusing to you and also the Lyft drivers. You can also take the tram to Luxor and Excalibur for FREEEE.

The convention center itself was a little smaller and more cramped than I am used to at the Venetian. Once you got back there it was like all the other conventions, but walking to and from was like getting on the struggle bus...basically it will take forever to walk since there are hoards of people walking slow in front and all around you.

OVERALL THOUGH this place was great and I would definitely stay here again.",6,1,2

The rooms are nicely decorated, large, and we experienced no issues with room service.  The pool area was crowded but our group rented a cabana (do that if you can afford it as you WILL enjoy the beach much more) and had a blast.  The variety of clubs, restaurants, and gaming is also impressive but expensive.  Staff are all friendly and helpful.  We had great meals at the Burger Bar, Ruffles cafe, and the Beach Cafe.  
The disadvantages are that the hotel is located at the far end of the strip near the airport (yes, you can hear airplanes taking off on occasion) and it's about a $15 taxi ride to the center strip area.  Don't like taxis? - The tram between MB and Luxor\/Excalibor is crowded and then you have to hike across another block or two to MGM Grand to the monorail.  If you don't need to be in the center of all the strip action, the MB is a classy hotel with lot's of options.",0,0,0

He informed me about the early closing of the pool which was very helpful for me to change my plan right away.  That's a star for the Front Desk.

After dinner, I came back to the hotel and wanted to use the Mandalay Bay valet.  I was told to use the West Valet even I have the room key.  I found my way to the West Valet but I got to the next lane which is Delano Valet.  Delano Valet refused to let me in because I stayed at Mandalay Bay and told me that I had to use Mandalay Bay Valet.  West Valet did not want to take my car since West Valet saw my room key.  At this time I saw a sign ""Michael Jackson One Valet"" for West Valet.  Just because I stayed at Mandalay Bay, I could not use Delano Valet and I could not use West Valet because I did not go to the show.  West Valet told me it's full but he kept taking more cars.  At this time I was very upset that Mandalay Bay Valet told me to use West Valet and West Valet did not want to take my car since I did not go to the show.  Delano Valet reserved its valet for Delano's guests.  How about Mandalay Bay? Clearly Mandalay Bay did not reserve for Mandalay Bay's guests.  I do not like the ball game to send me to West Valet and got refused.  West Valet cares and values about the show goers than the hotel guests.  Mandalay Bay Valet did not care about their hotel guests at all.  It really makes me upset about being a hotel guest at Mandalay Bay and got less treatment than Delano or show goers.  That's a minus.

The room are tidy with outdated décor.  Tiny shampoo, conditioner and lotion bottles.  No shower cap.  No mini fridge unless you request so I just use my cooler.  In the afternoon I came back from the pool and found a drunk cursing in the hall way wanted to pick up a fight.  I also found another drunk sitting on the floor across from my door.  I do not feel safe at all.

Casino floor is all right. The slot machine collection is less variety than other casinos on the Strip. The drink service on the floor was great.  I was harassed by some drunks but I did not see any staff around to help me.  It's not safe to stay on the casino floor alone or far away from friends.

The wave pool and lazy river are great for hot days that I stayed there.

My son wants to stay here for the next trip to celebrate my birthday just because of the wave pool.  Two days ago, I called MB VIP services for the prices.  I still debate between two dates so I called back today.  The first rep told me that $160 instead of $40 for the first night, second night is comp.  I called back 10 min later to speak to April.  April told me that my offer is not valid at all.  Black out dates apply for both dates, $158 and $60.  I did not see black out dates on my offer.  Pricing varies from different reps and different dates.  I asked to speak to a manager and April told me he was in a meeting at 8:30pm so I left my number for call back until 10:00pm.  No one ever called back.",1,0,0

Other than that, the hotel itself was as nice as any other hotel on the strip downstairs (lobby, casino, overpriced restaurants). Upstairs in the room, though, the walls were so thin that we could hear our neighbors throughout the night. The bathroom and room we a decent size, but the bathroom itself smelled like tobacco from the time we checked in to the time we left. We called house keeping several times to no avail. They said that they would be up immediately,and never came. When we went out for the night, we came back to a new pile of sheets on the bed, but no air freshener for the bathroom. It's like they weren't even listening. The air conditioner was set on 60 from the time wet checked in, but it constantly felt like 75 in the room. We were able to get a late checkout at the front desk when we checked in, which was 1 pm as opposed to 11 am. Room service and restaurants were as expensive as you would expect them to be in a 5 star resort. We asked for a microwave and were told it would be $30 extra per night. There is a $25 resort fee per room per night. In room wi-fi is pitifully slow. The business center charges to print, but the concierge is included in your resort fee. You need to budget about 45 minutes to check in since the line is very long (I think this is the case at most ""strip hotels."") It took forever to get up to our room. There are 6 elevators for floors 17-32, but the wait time to actually get in to an elevator and up to your room can be anywhere from 10-20 minutes. 

The resort itself is beautiful. The beach and the pool for a little over crowded, but seemed to be nice enough (we didn't have time to go).  The Toptional beach (over 21) has a $30 cover fee for men and free for women. The shark reef was nice, though the line to get in was quite long. Self park is shared with The Hotel at Mandalay, so it's a really long walk. If you're staying at the place, it's better to valet. Valet and Bell Desk were quick and courteous.

The hotel is beautiful and spacious which is something I really like.

We stayed in the Spa suite which was the perfect size for the two of us.

Room service was excellent. The food is actually really good. I've stayed at different hotels in Vegas where the quality of the food was just plain bad (cough cough..Mirage). We had the traditional american breakfast which was really good and huge. The employee who brought it up was pleasant and set up the table for us. I'm a huge coffee person so I don't say this lightly...they have the best coffee ever. I even called last time after getting back to find out what brand it was.

Step 1: Find the most expensive hotels on the Strip.
Step 2: Eliminate any hotels that have been opened less than a year, have had movies filmed about them (bye, bye, Bellagio), are on the bad end of the Strip, or can be found in your hometown.
Step 3: Eff it! There's still 20+ hotels on this list. Just go with Mandalay Bay.

I've stayed at the Mandalay a couple of different times. Love the suites. Love the effing lotion. OH.MY.GOSH! You can buy that crack in a bottle downstairs, but forget that. I take them directly from the maid carts when they come to clean my room. I'm sure my luggage has had a full-luggage-cavity-search because of the ridiculous amount of Mandalay Bay lotions in it. Actually, I'm surprised I haven't been put on a no fly list yet.

I only go to Vegas in October for a week of birthday+Halloween celebrations and I think I've only ever ran into four kids in the span of three years, but I'm sure they're there...lurking in the corners waiting for some unsuspecting guest to feed them something with sugar, only to turn out to be a human sized Gremlin. But whatevs, my trips have been safe and Gremlin-free thus far.

I could stay at the Mandalay my entire trip and still wouldn't be able to experience everything it has. But I think I've got the gist of it. Topless pool. Beach. Shark Reef. Lazy River. Bombdotcom buffets. Upscale restaurants. An infinite amount of ways to lose every penny to your name. I love it!

Like any holiday in Vegas, Halloween week is serious. So as you can imagine, Mandalay has tons of events going on and you'll run in to some cool characters and some dumb ones too. Tip of the day: NEVER GET IN AN ELEVATOR WITH ONLY ONE OTHER PERSON ON BOARD (unless you know the other person). My first trip I got stuck on an elevator for about 30 minutes with a mid-30's drunken buffoon that started crying. When entering an elevator immediately ask your self if the people on the elevator will entertain or annoy you. If there's only one person, choose another elevator because options are always nice.

I've walked the (entire) Strip before. I never plan on doing it again (not even a small section of the strip). I prefer my rentals and cabs 100% so MB's location works out perfect. Easy access on and off the Strip.

The suites. I've stayed in a couple different ones and strangely enough the smallest one is actually my favorite. If it's just you, you're going to be eating out every meal (which, why wouldn't you?), and you'll be out til 7 am-ish...stay in the Great Room Suite. It's open and everything about it is comforting. I'm still trying to figure out how to smuggle out the chaise\/couch thing...I want it. I need it. I can't find one anywhere.

If you're sharing you're hotel tab with a friend, go with the Extra Bedroom Suite. Amazing views too!

Play the slots. Get some food. Go get married. Swim topless. STAY AT THE MANDALAY BAY!

When I used their self parking garage to park my car, their self parking payment machines didn't seem to recognize my chip cards. 2 of their self parking payment machines accidentally overcharged me as I kept inserting the card. I asked management if they knew about the seemingly recurring issue on their self parking payment machines and their response was ""of course"". They also seemed completely unapologetic about it, as if it's acceptable to let their visitors be overcharged. 

They expected me to mail in a refund request and wait 6 weeks to get my money back for THEIR mistake. I was a bit surprised that they would allow a group of machines with a credit card glitch to go unresolved. I mean how difficult could it be to fix a simple parking garage machine with a credit card glitch? Don't they have all sorts of machines everywhere at Mandalay Bay? I'm sure they have technicians who can easily fix it. If a machine malfunction occurred at the business I manage, I would have gotten my technicians to fix it ASAP.

I felt in my mind at that time that it was a bit odd to have such overall lack of attention to detail and complete apathy towards the customer at this property. If they don't seem to care about parking machines that overcharge their visitors, then what else do they let slip through the cracks.

Two rooms, 1.5 baths, and a wet bar, this room was more than any couple really needed, especially since we weren't planning any hotel parties. We didn't have a direct strip view, but you could see it if you angled your head just right... Four tvs in the room, one in each section of the room (living room, wet bar, bedroom, bathroom).

The jacuzzi tub was more than pleasant, as was the overabundance of towels provided. All the little bottles of goodies were not only fun but also very high quality-- usually hotel shampoo leaves me feeling a little smarmy, but not this.

There was a FRIDGE in the room, which was so great, since I'd brought some pies for Thanksgiving and wanted them to keep for the two days leading up to the big dinner. I was also told by the woman at the front desk that if there wasn't one in the room already, I could call housekeeping to request a fridge, no charge. Charge for a DVD player though, which is included standard at THEhotel, boo.

Kind of got walked in on by the turndown service lady. Very awkward to run to the door pulling on things just to meet her and say, ""er, no thanks, the bed is sort of already turned-down, you see..."" Minus one star for that awkwardness.

Left my keys in the room after check out, but when we went back up to find them, the cleaning lady had very kindly set them aside for me. Phew!

I'll spare you the minor details (unhelpful personel\/ rude bartenders) and get to the nitty gritty.

Upon first entering my room, after a long wait to check in, I headed straight to the bathroom to relieve myself. As I was looking down, I was astonished to find dried urine marks on the toilet. Yes, housekeeping took the time to fold the first sheet of toilet paper into a nice, little, pointed tip, but decided cleaning up the last guest's misfire, was not top priority...gross. 

Later, I hop into the shower and find mold at the bottom of each corner. This surprised me even more than the pee stains. This was not something that was overlooked once, but habitually. That shower hadn't seen a full cleaning in MONTHS... really gross. I don't even want to think about how often they actually change the sheets. *cringe*

Ok so the housekeeping staff needs to change their eyeglass prescriptions, but how is the room service?
This is something (among many other things) that I really appreciate about the Venetian, which has exceptional room service. When I pay $25 for a sandwich, I expect it to be at least a few steps above something I'd get at Chili's. The Mandalay however, did not fulfill this expectation. Late one night, I ordered a corned beef reuben, which I looked forward to for the entire HOUR+ that I waited for it. ""Man, it's going to be so good""...NOT. Fucking terrible. The meat was so tough, I couldn't even bite through the sandwich. 

The final straw came when I went to pick my car up from valet. It's a push start, so the key doesn't need to be in the ignition to drive. This apparently caused too much of a mental overload for the valet service. One of the drivers must have tucked the key in his pocket and forgotten to tag it. I waited close to 20 minutes before I was informed that they could not find my key. They then proceeded to try to convince me that I had not actually turned in my key. After assuring them multiple times that I'm not a fucking idiot and that I had turned in the key, the driver had an epiphany of sorts and proclaims ""oh, I bet I know where it is"". Great, thanks genius. He headed inside to the lockbox, where they had apparently stored the key, because somebody was too lazy to backtrack and figure out to which car it belonged. 

I'm GIFTING this place 3 stars, seeing that it's not a total dump and actually has potential to be a great hotel. But considering the poor service, all the fees and overall price, Mandalay Bay leaves much to be desired. I'd rather pay the extra cash to stay at the Venetian (my default Vegas hotel).",0,1,0

The parking lot is extremely far from the elevators to the hotel rooms. You have to walk pretty far, and if you're lugging all your suitcases ... well you are going to have to lug it for a long time. Our hotel room was pretty nice with a great view of all the pools and the Lazy River that was not open because it was winter. Two queen sized beds, a table with chairs in the corner, a small couch that looks like it should fold out in an L shaped, but was just a small block, a TV in the room as well as in the bathroom, and a big bath and shower. 

Gripes\/complaints about the hotel room: the mini fridge is completely stocked with alcohol and soda and there is a sign that says if you even take out one alcohol bottle, you will immediately be charged. Good thing I saw that as I was planning to take out all the small bottles to take pictures of how cute they were! My mom was pretty upset at the fact that we couldn't even use our mini fridge. 

The toilet is in its own little room with a big heavy door that immediately swings close after you let go of it. There is no vent fan and the door automatically closes, so how could we air out the odors? We found a cup from the gym, crushed it, and used it as a door stop. The toilet also flushes incredibly loud, so when I went to the bathroom at 3 AM, I woke up my parents when I flushed the toilet, haha.

The bed is too soft. I never thought I would encounter a bed too soft, but I could not get a good nights sleep the two nights I was there. I usually can fall asleep on any bed, but I could not get myself comfortable in this one. The pillows were way too soft as well. A big fluffy pillow that sunk all the way down to the bed once I laid my head on it? Not good. And I found random hairs stuck to the pillow case! My mom thought the sheets were too rough, but I thought they were decent. 

Fitness room: Very big and decent sized with lots of cardio machines. They even have somebody there while the center is open (5 AM-8 PM I believe) to fold towels and make sure everybody who enters is a guest of the hotel. Each machine has its own television and these machines are state of the art! Ellipticals, treadmills, bikes, an arm spinning machine, etc. They have a very cold water filling machine as well with plastic cups. Don't forget to take your water bottles to get them refilled! They offer towels and headphones. HOWEVER, you are unable to use the weights as the weights come with the sauna where you must pay $25 a day. That sucks. 

Pool and jacuzzi: Came on a pretty cold day, so it was incredibly windy and cold. Got some towels and jumped into the pool. It is quite narrow so there isn't much room to swim. I was trying to swim laps in the pool, but once people are in there playing and talking, it is quite impossible unless you continue to go around them for each lap. The jacuzzi is very powerful and can fit a lot of people. It isn't that hot, which is good as I know it isn't good to stay in the jacuzzi for too long. However, it could be warmer, especially during the winter time. The pumps are really powerful. I thought it was disgusting that a lady was eating a hamburger while sitting in the jacuzzi. Bathrooms for the pool are clean. 

Resort fee: $25 for resort fee is too expensive. I believe they charge the same price or maybe a few dollars more for during the summer time, which is understandable as people tend to use the pool more then. But in the winter when the man made beach is closed, the wave pool is closed AND the lazy river is closed, it really isn't fair to charge the same amount. What if people don't want to use the pool or wi-fi? The wi-fi didn't even work very well. I had to constantly reconnect and usually, the wifi was so slow I just resorted back to using my own phone's data. 

The location of Mandalay Bay is fair, but it's a little far from all the other hotels on the strip. Good exercise though. Beautiful golden windows that you are immediately greeted with once you are off the freeway. Probably won't be back to this hotel. Need my sleep in Vegas!",10,3,3

These things rocked!

-Free Internet in the room
-Our view on the 31st floor was amazing
-Layout of the casino was nice and the evening dance band was really fun
-Starbuck's coffee at the Casino level-great way to start the morning!

The not so great things:

-Checked in at around 7:00 and our choice of rooms was limited on the upper floors.  No king Beds available and ended up with an accessible room
-Safe in room was itty bitty-not big enough for a computer, barely big enough for a cell phone.  (I-pad might fit)
-No real directions for using internet.  It still showed that there would be charge when you logged in, but when you call the desk they said it was included.

The pool and beach area was beautiful, but because it was January it was closed. I think this would be a huge and exciting benefit if you stayed there during the right time.   If you are looking for a great breakfast place while at the hotel, be sure to check out House of Blues who offers the best price that we found.

Hair Dryer, Iron and Iron board were all provided in the room.",1,0,0

by and large the hotel\/beach staff  is as non-helpful as these yelp-reviews say. we arrived at 2 (checkin was at 3) and were told that our room wasn't ready.  so instead of refreshing after our morning of travel, we wandered around and familiarized ourself with the layout...for 3 hours.  we went up to the desk at 5 and were told that our room was ready, but they were behind on calling people.  at 6:30 (after we'd been in the room for an hour and half), we were finally called.

we were read the riot act at checkin about the minibar, only to discover that there were things missing when we arrived. when we called to let them know, they acted like we were morons. if the standard ""welcome to our hotel"" speech includes warning you about how sensitive the keys are to being demagnetized (and they were), invest in new keys.

our room was nice enough (we'd stepped up to a suite with an expanded bathroom), but was next to the ice machine. i could have complained, but *someone* has to get that room. just not sure why they'd put a mid-range suite next to it and not something a bit lower-priced.  the elevator bank on our floor was missing a few buttons, but they were replaced during our stay. the drain on the floor of our shower wasn't attached, and the light in the vanity mirror was out.

little things, yes, that would barely register at a different hotel with a different attitude about itself (in a different price range), but really stuck in my mind and darkened the beginning of the trip until i actively chose to not let it bother me.

that having been said...

the casino is great. the ceilings are high, it's brightly lit without being gaudy, it actually smells good instead of like excessive amounts of smoke. the dealers\/pit bosses were by and large a friendly bunch, the cocktail waitresses were friendly and frequent, even at the ""cheap"" tables, and when we wandered into the slots area to play money others had given to us.  although i would have liked more $10 tables, i know that's a sign of the economy.  best of all, it's not cramped, either, like some of the nearby casinos.

we ate here almost exclusively, and the restaurants that surround the casino floor were all incredibly tasty.  we stayed away from the bars\/clubs because that's not really our style, and i have a hard time paying $14 for something i can get for ""free"" while playing blackjack ;) no, it's not a cheap place to eat\/drink, but then again, it's also not a *cheap* place.  i feel better spending the extra cash, feeling indulgent, and getting something fabulous, than getting something that's cheaper, but still over-priced, and a poor quality than i'd get back home for 1\/2 the price. to me, that's more of a waste of my money.

i spent one morning\/afternoon at THEbathhouse spa and will make that a highlight of every trip back to vegas, regardless of where i stay.

the only thing you gain by staying at the resort (in one of 3 hotels) is access to the pool\/beach area.  is it worth it? i'm not sure, because this is the first trip to vegas i've actually gone to the pool. while the sand was novel and gave it a very beachy feel, there was sand on everything at the end of the day ;)  i certainly enjoyed the wave pool and the lazy river, but since i'm not the sort to lay out and crispify on a regular basis, i think i might not have missed it.  the beach also attracts families in the way a similarly-priced resort might not, which was a real down-side to the whole place.

we were planning on venturing out to the rest of the strip, because ""that's what you do,"" but since we'd seen most of it before, and almost everything at this resort (save the actual hotel room) was so inviting, we stayed put for the most part.

what i enjoyed about mandalay bay can almost entirely be acquired without staying there.  on our next trip out, we may stay at THEhotel.  it's on site, so it gives you access to the beach and from what i saw on my way to and from their spa, likely worth the extra money: less kids, nicer accomodations, decor more our style, and closer to the ""good"" starbucks ;)   we didn't stay there mostly because of yelp reviews complaining about how far away it is from things.  yes, it's not next to the beach entrance, but that means your elevator doesn't empty out to a bunch of people in swimwear. it's along the edge of the casino like everything else *except* the conference center and the sharkreef, which are a hike no matter which property you stay at.

more likely,  we may save the cash and stay at the luxor.  the difference in price will pay for a fabulous dinner at stripsteak or redsquare, and beach aside, everything at MB is an easy indoor walk away and the biggest risk there is walking by all the shops between them. ;)",1,1,1

Moorea pool was a nice pool, however it took FOREVER to get drinks, food, salads, and it wasn't even a busy weekend.  Took a half hour to get salad dressing so i could eat my salad that got hot by the time it arrived...actually i had to find a manager to get it for me because my waiter never came back?  

I expect better service and better management solutions when things go wrong at a hotel.  When you pay top dollar for service, I expect to get it. The HOliday Inn Express has better service than this hotel.  

AFTER we checked out, 2 people in our party had to call back to fix their ""over charging"" at the pool and for the hotel room.  So, even more time wasted on the phone after we left to get that taken care of which still took several phone calls to get it resolved and waiting on hold for 30 minutes before someone would answer.

Overall, I would stay somewhere else.  

PS - when this hotel says that you are getting a King bed you are actually getting a Queen bed.  When they say you are getting a Queen bed, you are actually getting a double bed.  Not sure why they need to falsely advertise your bed size, but it does make a difference when you plan to have people share a double bed! Gets a little more cozy than desired.  The Palms Hotel does the same thing.  If the ""vegas standard"" is smaller than real life then why don't they just say it?",3,0,0

Our purpose in Vegas was for a reunion, but we had brought my daughter and future son-in-law along, so they could have some fun away from home, as well.  Although our reunion venue was in Downtown Las Vegas, we chose to book a room at the Mandalay Bay.  Since it was located on the strip, we felt they could get the full Las Vegas experience, while we attended the reunion on our own.

We opted for a Resort Queen room, located on the 12th floor with a beautiful view of the resort's beach and poolside amenities.  The room was spacious with two queen-sized beds (very comfy mattresses), His and Hers lighted closets, a 42"" LED, multiple charging and connection outlets, Wi-Fi access, a beautiful bathroom complete with twin vanities and well-lit makeup mirror, a glass-enclosed shower and a large, jetted soaking tub.  Too bad our stay wasn't long enough to make use of the tub.

The room included a fully stocked, refrigerated mini bar and a bar on top of the desk too.  WARNING: Both bars are highly sensitive.  In fact, Ariana warned me of this, before handing me the keycards to our room.  You won't notice the sensor attached to the top bar immediately, so don't even think about touching anything or you WILL be charged.  Like an immature adolescent, I made the mistake of removing the ""Temptation Lover's Kit"" for a few minutes to giggle at what was on its label.  Shortly after I had taken a picture of the back label, I had returned it to its position on the bar.  Upon checkout, however, a $36.75 charge appeared on my folio.  Try explaining that to the front desk in order to get the charge reversed!  Marietta looked annoyed and unconvinced that I had returned it to the bar untampered, but proceeded to credit my account anyway.

Despite that, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and will return.",13,8,13

A few years ago, you would be hard pressed to find a room for less than $130 even in off-peak days. 

So what is wrong with a cheaper room rate? Well, it means that some of the little things that matter, start falling by the way side. I checked in to the hotel last week, and here are somethings that I found a little disappointing:

-- The light switch by the door did not turn on any lights in the room. It turned on a very dim light by the entrance, but I had to find the light knobs on the individual lamps in the dark. 

-- The chair provided in the room needed to have been re-upholstered. It was filthy. 

-- The bed was plain uncomfortable. It had a mattress pad on it (which I did not ask for) and sleeping on one side of the bed meant sleeping slanted. 

-- There was no TV schedule guide in the room so I had no idea what channel was what unless I manually flipped through every channel.

Having said that, the room had a bright and shiny flat screen TV and the bathroom was impeccable. 

But what I like most about Mandalay are the options for lounging and eating. They have Rum Jungle, Red Square, Minus 5, Burger Bar, Mix and plenty more, which really matters if you are looking to have a great evening, without leaving the hotel. 

The pool at Mandalay is of course, one of the most popular ones in Vegas. They have not only a pool that has waves to emulate a beach, but also one that you ride a tube in around the premises.

I probably wouldn't stay here again unless they sent me a really, really good offer (and I had a free night, as it was . . . paid for two with the third free). I think the new lounges in Luxor are starting to make this property look and feel a little dated to me. Not that I want to stay at any MGM property, really, but I don't mind playing at them at all (i.e. drinking). Oh yeah, and I won 90 bucks on a Village People penny slot machine.

Decided to keep the room specially because we drove almost 4 hours and was not willing to do that loooooong line. Went to the famous beach and getting a place to sit was also impossible,  just left our stuff under a tree and jumped in the pool, really? And I was charged for a resort fee. Next morning, found two bugs on my bed and another mini roach in the closet was going to complain and again no answer in the concierge line and lobby line super long, we rushed to beach area again to see if we had any luck this time with a bench, and will complain about room after our fun day at the pool\/beach. After being out all day, came back to room to get ready for a show at 9pm, and our surprise was that the room had NOT been cleaned, housecleaning never touched it and it was exactly how we left it in the morning, no clean towels and covers on the floor. THIS WAS TOO MUCH!!! We complained and all they had to say was ""We are so sorry for the inconvenience"" and they only refunded us the resort fee (so they said, it's still not showing on my bank account transactions, but this happened last night... I only hope). I think a stay at Motel 6 would be much pleasant than this overpriced and overrated hotel. I would never ever come stay at Mandalay Bay again!!",0,0,0

If you don't pay, you have to pay on and out charges. Supposedly they're trying to ""Improve customer parking experience"". I think they failed at that because it was still just as inconvenient but we now have to pay. 

The pool is nice but the food there is subpar and expensive. 

Check in takes for ever. BUT for an EXTRA FEE you can go in the short line. It wasn't like this the last time we stayed here. It seems like they injected extra bureaucracy so they can charge more for an express line. Its like waiting in line at airport security. 

It's pretty far from everything, not really walking distance to anything. Smells less smokey than other hotels which is a plus but still smells of smoke a little bit.

Every year that we've gone to Vegas, we've stayed at the Mandalay Bay. We just love the cleanliness of the room and the pool with the waves and lazy boy (our kids best friends).

Cleanliness, large bathtub (though we wished it was a Jacuzzi), separate shower, separate toilet room, great view, clean carpet, clean bed, long corridor, AC

ROOM CONS:
Refrigerator usage (you can't put your own stuff in and if you move anything in the frig, they will charge you for it), fare size living room

I am with an agreement with all the others yelper on the daily resort fee ($35 + tax) and parking fee. If your staying at the hotel, they should at least comp you for parking.

Long wait at concession\/food stands

This whole debacle literally took 15 minutes to solve.  All the while, a 3rd cashier in the back opened up only to start ringing people up from the back of the line....are you kidding me?

It's sort like playing for the Buffalo Bills. Technically, you are an NFL team and you play in New York. But wouldn't you rather play for the Jets or Giants?

Clearly, business is all about location. 

Luckily for me, my 11-day business trip brought me to the Mandalay Bay. It made my walk (of shame) to my work a bit more bearable and my walk (of fame) back to my room a bit more exciting. Throughout the day and especially the evening, there are plenty of quality places to eat, drink, and eventually, sin.

""Big money! C'mon, big money!""

That's what I heard over and over at the ""Wheel of Fortune"" slot machine inside the casino. I witnessed a business colleague play this machine for a few hours, lose all of her money by 12:30 A.M. and get cut off from the ATM machines. This lead to her calling her husband in Pennsylvania (at 3:30 A.M. his time) for more money. He said no. By 1 A.M., she was offering to buy me drinks with her company credit card in exchange for my cash so she could play the ""Wheel of Fortune"" slot machine a bit more. Eventually, she was offering more favors before I made her go to bed.

Mandalay Bay may have the largest water budget in Las Vegas (despite the 'lake' at the Bellagio) to keep the grounds so beautifully green!

(I don't know whether that's natural from the plentiful orchids on the main floors or if it's artificial, but it smells great!)  The staff is efficient -- possibly because Mandalay Bay lacks the constant crowds of the more central Strip hotels -- although they seemed to gush over people I assumed (from biased observation) were high rollers (or at least higher rollers than my room indicated I was) while relatively perfunctorily taking care of me.

The halls of the room floors are bright and clean.  The room I was in was a good size, simply and tastefully done in browns, tans, and occasional steel.  There was a surprising amount of closet space.  The large bathroom has separate areas for most things (even splitting the shower and the large, deep bathtub); one caution is that in my room the bathroom had a large, partially frosted (in vertical lines) glass window between it and the entrance hallway in the room -- if that's the case in all the rooms, know that any roommates will be able to see you bathing or dressing.  My fourth floor room was relatively loud from a combination of building air conditioning units right outside, general noise -- cars, airplanes -- though the thin windows, and the thin walls and doors.

Mandalay Bay's casino is a decent size, with a wide variety of games and minimum bets.  There are a _lot_ of restaurants around the hotel and the Mandalay Place area between the Mandalay Bay and the Luxor, plus a decent array of shops in Mandalay Place.

* No wait at valet.  Pulled up, got out, walked in.
* No wait at check in.  We were really early, so the front desk called when our room was ready. Wait was less than one hour.  Bags arrived within minutes.
* Room was GREAT.  33rd floor with a floor to ceiling view straight up the strip. http:\/\/static3.px.yelp.com\/photo\/fH90Lb6YPf1MBJ2utm0HHA\/l

* Room service provided by Speedy Gonzalez.  Seriously, our food arrived almost before I hung up the phone.  Also, it was very good.
* The valet pick up for your car deserves special mention.  Their system is so freaking efficient that whoever set it up should conduct seminars for the rest of the strip hotels.  Additionally, they offer a bottle of water as you're walking out to pick up your car.  Nice.
* Wide variety of restaurants.  
* Pools are beautiful. Easy access from rooms, which is nice. Very crowded. Great for kids.  I don't like kids, except my own, so if you're interested, I've reviewed Moorea Beach Club separately.  No kids there.  Wooot!
* Casino:  big, clean, not claustrophobic in the least.  Very pretty servers provide great cocktail service.  For video poker players, Mandalay Bay is perhaps the worst casino on the strip.  This is unfortunate for us because otherwise, we really enjoyed our stay.

We booked the Strip View room, which turned out to only have a partial Strip view.  The window was also so small that for the most part I could only see the ""The Hotel"" across from us.  On the positive side, the room was huge!  We could have easily rolled in another king size bed and it would have still felt very spacious.  Bathroom contained a fairly large jetted tub, which was really nice.  This would have been a great room for a party!  However after spending 10 minutes on trying to get wired connection to work, I decided to use the wireless.  One morning we did not have water, b\/c they were doing repairs and forgot to turn it back on.  Another evening  we didn't have cable.  So overall I was not impressed. 

-- Casino --
This was probably the best part of the hotel.   Mandalay Bay continued their Mediterranean theme into the casino, so it's a pretty place to hang out.  I found it less smoky and loud than other casinos.  It also seems to be more spacious, so the tables and slot machines are not jammed together with barely any room to pass.   

-- Pool --
""The Beach"" was a huge disappointment!   At 2pm on a Saturday it was so extremely crowded that we could not find any lounge chairs.  In addition, there was not an inch of shade!  Only the paid lounge chairs have an umbrella and they cost around $150 for the day.  There was absolutely nothing luxurious about this experience...I can't even call it classy or even remotely upscale.  We saw some signs for pool-side casino and decided to check it out.  When we walked up to the area, it was totally closed. The pool side dining left a lot to be desired too, so we went to Borders Grill instead, which turned out to be really great.",1,0,0

The public areas are great, indoors and out.  It's clean and large.  They have a lazy river, wave pool and other sunning areas.  I like most of the restaurants in this hotel.  They have a separate ticketing procedure for concerts at the ""beach.""

The valet line is long and the cab line is long, perhaps because of its location at the south end of the strip.

The bad part is that unlike other hotels, they do not slip your bill under your door before checkout (although I think you can request this).  Instead they email your invoice to you within 7-10 days of your stay.  Both times I stayed, the invoice did not have line item expenses listed, only a lump charge for all costs.  I made multiple charges using my guest key and wanted an itemized receipt.  You have to contact their accounting department via e-mail for billing inquiries.  They promise a response in 10 days (which is too long).  Both times they did not respond within 10 days.  Management had to get involved.  

Although I do enjoy my time here, this is a billing hassle.  What is designed to be easy, is in fact, not easy at all.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt after my first experience and did choose to stay a second time, only to have the billing fiasco repeated.

Pros:

- Not trying to be Venice (like the Venetian) or Rome (like Caeser's Palace). You're a freaking hotel in the middle of the desert. Don't pretend to be something else that you'll never be.

- Rocking good Tuna Nicoise salad from room service.

- Nice gym.

- Nice suites.

- Nice chair, desk for banging out email.

- Ethernet cable for reliable connection.

- Well-stocked bathroom and closet. (Soaps, shampoo, sewing kit, iron...)

- Fairly quiet.


Cons:

- (Branding geek alert) Capitalizing THE everywhere -- THE hotel, THE wedding chapel -- falls flat and seems contrived. Almost as if their marketing department said, ""hey, we want to be cool like the W Hotel, who incorporate the letter ""w"" into signs and services in clever ways. The W pulls it off since it was pretty clever when it came out. Slapping THE isn't clever, and comes off as lame. 

- Minibar has Bud Light. Seriously folks, if you're gonna charge me an arm and a leg for an adult beverage, make it something that deserves to be called ""beer"".

- Room service timing is random. When I ordered the aforementioned Tuna Nicoise after a workout, they said, ""it'll be 60-75 minutes sir"". I reluctantly agreed. Then the guy came 20 minutes later. Thankfully I was out of the shower by then. 

- The next day, I ordered breakfast, and got the same 60-75 minute estimate. Having a meeting 60 minutes later, I skipped this. Protip: when running a hotel, assume that a certain percentage of your guests actually eat breakfast and order room service, and staff up accordingly.

- I got breakfast at THEcafe (those names...) and paid $15 for a ""build it yourself"" bagel, which I had the pleasure of eating at a dirty table. Oh, and the receipt prompted me to tip them for the privilege. THEannoyance...",4,8,0

I called guest services many times during my stay for various things and all my interactions were always so pleasant and helpful.

Best hotel in Vegas and the only place my wife and I will stay.

We travel to Vegas 3-4 times a year.  I like to gamble, she likes to sit at the pool or go to the spa.  She raves about the spa and massages.  We find the restaurant options to be plentiful.  We have always been treated with respect and taken care of at MB.  They are very generous with comps and that keeps us coming back.  We will be there in 2 weeks for the Memorial Day weekend and they comped our room for the first 2 nights and gave a huge discount for Saturday and Sunday.

I will say if you are coming to Vegas for the club scene this may not be the place for you.  Yes the pool is awesome and has a sort of clubby atmosphere, especially the moorea beach club.  (By the way its full of dudes.)   Also others complain that it is too far down on the strip.  Even better if you ask me.  I have been to Vegas many a times I dont need to walk up and down the strip to see whatever gimmick the newest hotel is advertising.

There's many options for dining so you don't really have to leave Mandalay.

Mandalay Beach was really crowded, although we still had a great time. The cafe at the pool was pretty good, and the cocktails had a decent amount of alcohol but not enough to get buzzed after three of them. With the expensive drinks and a tube rental costing $22, I spent a couple hundred down at Mandalay Beach. Still, we enjoyed the lazy river and wave pool. There was an incident where one guys stuff got stolen and he was freaking out at security. I left my phone and stuff in the room in the case that something like that would happen to me.

We dined at Aureole and thought it was overpriced for the outdated menu they had there and wasn't executed well. For example, the foie gras dish says it has a crispy sweet potato waffle, but ours was really mushy. The hotel in it's entirety I feel is outdated compared to the center strip.

When I'm paying for a nicer hotel, I expect at least B+ service.   We left with the impression that this hotel is all about squeezing every dollar out of you and they're not worried about feedback since there are 1500 more people checking in every day. 

1.  Lazy river.   They advertise this big time but they don't tell you they charge $24 for an inner tube.  If not free, they should at least rent them for a few bucks, right?   TIP: Go to CVS on the strip and get the same inner tube for $4.   

2.  They advertise the shark reef but it costs $18 for this mildly entertaining adventure.

3.  No coffee in the rooms.  Ok, my math says they save around $1,000,000 per year by not having coffee in 4000 rooms.  Fine.  At least have enough coffee shops in the hotel.  There's only Starbucks and one other coffee place.   I don't even mind the extra markup.  However I waited 30 - 45 minutes in the morning for a cup of coffee with a bunch of angry people.  They're also grumbling about the lazy river while waiting for coffee.  

4.  After driving hours to get there, we had to wait 45 minutes to valet our car.  The valet parker told me it's like that all summer long.   Translation:  They're too cheap to hire 2 more valet guys to make it quicker.   When I left and came back that night, another 30 minutes in the valet line.  Outrageous.

5.   Problems with our room:  Bathtub was dirty and 2 lights didn't work.  

Any time you try to give feedback they say the same thing:  Sorry, we have 1500 people checking in today.

On day two, I phoned guest services to tell them I'm not happy and I may check out a day early.   Their response:  ""Ok sir, I have you leaving on the 27th now.   Any thing else?""   They didn't even ask what the problem was.  

I filled out an email survey stating all of the above and asked them to contact me.  NO RESPONSE.   My wife is so easy to please and she encouraged me to check out early.    We came across dozens of guests that were having a similar experience.    Keep ignoring us but eventually it will catch up with this hotel.  

I will never stay here again and it's a shame.   If they just cared a little, it would be a great place.   The wave pool and lazy river are fun for kids.",2,0,0

My girlfriend lost her debit card at Daylight Beach Club on Labor Day so I contacted lost and found to see if they have it. Sure enough they had it and the lady I spoke with on the phone said I could pick it up at the security stand. 

When I approached the security stand and mentioned ""girlfriend's debit card,"" Enrique immediately cut me off saying, ""Listen here buddy, even if you were her spouse we're not going to give it to you. This is a matter of money, she can come down here herself and get it."" I asked what time would she be able to get it, trying to fight back coughs at the same time ( I had a frog in my throat), and Enrique snapped a, ""What did you say to me?"" as if I was back talking him under my breath. 

The whole time I was interacting with Enrique it felt like he was talking down on me. He was not empathetic at all towards my cause. His general attitude was, ""You're an idiot for thinking you can come down here and pick up someone else's card, despite what the lady on the phone said."" As if I was an extreme inconvenience to him for approaching his security stand.

Working in the hotel business myself, I'm extremely disappointed someone like Enrique is allowed to work on a Las Vegas strip property. That attitude does not belong in the hospitality business.",11,2,0

A HUGE JETTED JACUZZI BATHTUB!

I love that the bathrooms also have their own TVs and the beds here are soooooooooooo comfy and soft. It is always worth it to upgrade to a room with a view of The Strip because MB has the best view. We came right in the middle of the NCAA Sweet 16. There was also a convention and spring breakers all around, so it was pretty busy and we were told there would be no chance of late check out, but when we called at 8am, the front desk was able to help us out with no problem.

The only gripes I have with MB are things that are probably out of the resort's control. Being that it is further south on The Strip, when it comes to late night dining, there really aren't a lot of options around that are within walking distance, and the 24 hour room service can sometimes be a hit or miss, but always pricey. I was turned away by one restaurant who's kitchen closed at 11pm, and was turned off by another when the service was too slow and too poor (you kind of get the idea that all of the chainy restaurants that are situated in between the casino walkways and in shopping areas just don't give a damn about anything). The casino here is also a little on the higher end with tables being the lowest at $10 during slow times. This can sometimes be a good thing, like when I'm up $400 on blackjack, but a killer when I'm down.

But other than that, the hotel rooms are pristine and modern, and the hotel staff are always helpful and friendly. I can't wait to go back!

The process is too scientific: I either wind up anxiously attempting to balance both sides or I end up spattering out something with bigger words that I think makes me sound smart (that doesn't work. see 99% of my reviews).  I'm a fan of this process though.  It's a great way to tell people what's good and bad, without trying to provide some sort of interesting, figurative prose that interests no one. 

After my long yelp tenure, I think I've finally found the place to practice this.  Here goes:

Pros: 
-Big room
-Smelly good casino
-Good fancy restaurants
-Provides many opportunities for me to become gamblor, king of losing money
-Attached to other casinos
-Hubert Keller
-Pretty kick-ass pooling area
-Proximity to Fat Tuesday. 
-House of Blues

Cons:
-Furniture in the room was chipping
-Aforementioned chipping and carpet stain unfortunately aged the room
-Overly crowded
-My inability to request a late check out, even after paying a premium for a suite and an added resort fee
-A lengthy wait on the phone to inquire about late check out
-Proximity to other casinos
-Lack of cheap food court for drunken-consumption of terrible food
-Out of place tattoo shop

So it was only natural that on this Vegas trip I made it a point to make a reservation to stay here. 

I booked a 2 bedroom panoramic suite and arrived on a Friday. The check in process was fairly easy. All desks were open and helping guests so even though there was a long line I was checked in and headed to my room in less than 15 minutes. 

The room! My gosh the room is fantastic! The suite my family and I stayed in was on the 12th floor and as the name of the room implies it has two bedrooms. One bedroom has one king bed and the other room (the bigger of the two rooms) has two queen beds. Each room has its own bathroom. The room with the king bed has a tub, two sinks and a shower while the other room had two sinks and a shower stall. 

The shared living area was huge! Two flat screen TV's, two separate sitting areas. One side had a couch and the other had a table and four very comfortable chairs. There is also a table that separates the room and sits up to five The room also boasts fantastic views of the pool and Las Vegas Strip. There is also a mini wet bar and snacks that offers alcohol and snacks for a fee. 

Now on to the rest of the property:

The casino floor seemed smaller than most other casinos on the Strip and a quick lap around the entire floor took less than 10-15 minutes. They have all the new slot machines and some of the old favorites. The table games are the same as in every other casino and the dealers and every employee on the casino floor that I encountered were friendly, courteous and were very helpful. 

There are several restaurants on the property and they range from fast food to elegant dining. The buffet was really good. I had the dinner service and Sunday brunch. 

Overall my stay at the Mandalay Bay Hotel & Casino exceeded my expectations and then some. The property is clean, the employees are friendly and the food and beverage selection is impeccable. The cornerstone of my visit though had to be the room. It was fantastic but then again, MGM Resorts International always brings it. 

Stay here. You won't be disappointed.

* They filter their water and that makes a big difference, you can actually lather in the shower!

* Views are very good if you have a room facing the Strip, hopefully on is available when you check in

* Rates could get pricey, especially during their busy season starting in April\/May.  We were fortunate to get $189\/night for the weekend (Convention Rate), that is considered cheap.

Reservations and check in went smoothly with friendly staff.  There are a lot more lines and space for checking in compared to the short areas for checking out.  This is likely due to the automated and online checkout procedures.

The rooms are well kept and spacious.  Beds were comfortable.  A great thing for work related trips is that there is free highspeed internet in the rooms.  I hate when I have to pay extra for the internet connection, it should just be rolled into my room cost.

Something that I guess is nice is the dual closet that has a high rod for dresses.  The showers had good water pressure for a refreshing shower after long days of work.

The only drawback to the Mandalay is that it is so large.  If you are going to a conference in the convention center and staying in the hotel the trip takes a few minutes.  But if you are unfortunate enough to have additional meetings in the conference rooms at THE Hotel in addition to the convention center while you stay in the Mandalay tower this can make for quite a few miles during the day.

Unfortunately, the stars did not align on this recent visit and in fact, anything that could go wrong went wrong.  I would still recommend The Mandalay Bay as the best family choice hotel because of its pool.  However, I do offer caution with regards to their customer service.

We arrived to the hotel on 20150713.  Group Services had assured me that they had documented in their notes that we had made the request to get our party as close to each other as possible.  It is hotel policy that they cannot guarantee room proximity, but that they do make note and do their best to accommodate.  Unfortunately, upon checkin there were no such notes left for the front desk.  Nevertheless, this was a minor mishap and a simple mistake by the hotel.

My wife and I had reserved the Tradewinds suite on the 62nd floor.  It is a very nice suite, and I definitely recommend it.  To our misfortune, the refrigerator was not working.  Maintenance made three attempts to fix it.  Each time they said they had, but they had not.  They finally said they would send a new one in the morning.  At 0100 in the morning they wanted to come and check the fridge again. 

 Fortunately we were awake because we had to settle an issue with room accommodations that were not honored.  I went down to the front desk.  Of course I was upset.  It was late and I was concerned.  The front desk was ill-prepared to handle the situation.  In response, the hotel attendant claimed that the hotel had thought they were a single party in one room.  I explained that I had paid for two and why would I pay for two rooms and be okay with only receiving one?  The hotel's solution was to upgrade our party to the 62nd floor with us.  Initially this sounded like a good thing.  It wasn't, and this is where everything spiraled out.

I asked the front desk attendant if the room had multiple beds or and adjoining room.  He said no.  When I let him know that would not work he rolled his eyes at me.  He replied that it was a $200 a night upgrade and that we should be content with it.  He also said, ""you should be happy with this unique opportunity"".  Naturally I got upset and raised my voice.  I was asked to lower my voice which I did.  However, I was very upset that I was socially profiled by some punk kid who made up his own mind that the Mandalay Bay was doing us a favor and that we did not belong on that floor. 

I reiterated that the room accommodations did not serve our needs or desires because we could not separate the children from their parents.  Again, the hotel desk attendant rolled his eyes at me.  At that point I asked him to stop his rude body language and condescending tone.  In shock, he apologized for his actions and offered to get his manager.  I'm sure this was the equivalent of a car dealer going to discuss a deal with their ""manager"".  

The young lady came forward and was clearly not informed of the situation.  Additionally, she was immediately on the defensive.  It was late so I am sure she was tired as well, and for that she is given a pass on her lack of professionalism.  I explained to her that we could not have my parties children separated from the parents.  I asked the staff if they themselves would be content with leaving their children alone in their own room in Las Vegas, which they said yes.  Yeah right!!!  I foolishly said that Las Vegas is not some Mexican family resort, and with the NBA summer league going on there are concerns.  Very cleverly the manager twisted my comment into a racial comment.  I applauded her for her quick wit, but I was offended to be labeled as a bigot.  I understand I did not articulate myself appropriately, but the fact of the matter is when children are involved (two-teens and 6yo) and it is Las Vegas there are concerns when your children are alone.  

Finally the manager explained that it was not possible to provide adjoining rooms because the hotel was completely full.  Had that been mentioned from the jump we would have been able to address the matter completely different.  The whole time the staff was dancing around that fact.  Once we understood this we understood an alternative had to be made.  The hotel offered roll-away beds.  Unfortunately, that was our only option and we took it.  There was no offer of apology or an offer to make up for the transgression.  

On two separate occasions we had to clean our own room.  The worst of it was on our wedding day.  We had to call housekeeping to remind them to clean our room at 7:00 pm.  What a shame on your wedding day.

I know this situation as Mandalay Bay explained was an isolated case.  However, measures should always be made to correct their error and appease the party.  IF this is how we are treated after paying $10,000 up front in hotel fees, I feel sorry for those who are budget travelers.",2,2,0

1. close to the airport. transport in and out is quick.

Which we did so we headed to our ""suite"".  When we got there our door was propped open and there was a gentleman in there ""stocking the refrigerator in the mini bar"".  After a long road trip I was ready to enjoy a drink from the refrigerator that was supposedly just stocked.  So I open the refrigerator and everything inside is hot including the refrigerator.  I call the desk and was told they would have engineering look at it.  I told them we were getting ready to leave the room and they could come in and get it looked at.  Wouldn't the guy that just stocked it not see that it was hot?  We get back later that evening and the refrigerator still was hot.  I called again and was told engineering looked at it and they were supposed to switch it out.  So I told them that had not happened.  So they assured me they would get it resolved.  We leave and again come back to our room and see the message light is blinking.  I call to retrieve the message and it was a recording stating the refrigerator had been replaced and if we had other problems to call.  So...I look and sure enough the fridge has still not been replaced.  I called the desk and told them that since it was already late and we were ready for bed if they could resolve it the next day.  They apologized at first and then said  there was no work order in the system??? HUH?  So after explaining they said they would get it resolved the next day.  Well the next day came and by the evening...NOTHING. So I called and told them that I was unhappy and to forget it.  At that point I was really upset and told them not to worry about replacing it.  I asked for a comp of at least the resort fee which they did.  So the day after we got there we go to use the small toilet and could not tolerate the smell of vomit in there.  We look behind the door and the floor molding and sure enough you can see where someone vomited in there.  I was already upset and at this point did not call the front desk.  I figured they would get to it as quickly as they did for the refrigerator anyway.  The room was dusty and really not as clean as I would have expected it for the cost.   Also the Internet only worked the first day and after that it did not. When I checked out the desk clerk asked ""how was our stay"" and I did just tell him about the fridge but he didn't seem phased when I told him they had adjusted the resort fees.

For the most part, I just prefer to stay other places.  The Mandalay Bay itself is a very nice property.  It is BIG.  It has a Four Seasons hotel on the top floors of the property as well as an adjoining hotel tower that is THE Hotel.  I have stayed at both of the ""other"" properties at Mandalay Bay, and gave both 4 stars.

The only real problem for me is the location.  Being at the South end of the Strip (last property) past Excalibur and the Luxor, I do not find the locale prime for walking around and hitting other places on foot.  There is nothing across the street ever since they closed down the Klondike, other than the airport.  For that reason, it gets really quiet, especially late at night.

The casino is huge.  There are tons of tables, tons of slots and video poker machines, and everything is well spread out so you never feel cramped.  I like that.

The restaurants and bars\/nightclubs on-property are very nice, and there are quite a few to choose from.  There is a House of Blues, the Foundation Room for invited guests, and Rum Jungle for dancing, to name a few.

There is a shark reef aquarium that is nice to visit, whether you have kids to entertain or not.  The spa is also worth a visit, although I have not been there in years.  The beach area and pool(s) are excellent.

The casino was nicely organized and I liked the fact that they still had a decent number of BJ tables open in the wee hours (about 5-6am) for me to play.

I also loved the 24 hours sundries store right next to the elevator for my late night snack and drink needs.

Valets were also quite speedy and service all throughout was very friendly.",2,0,1

At the Spa downstairs. Signed bill for $90 and the masseuse added in a $10 dollar tip and changed the final price to $100. Yes they will steal from customers and commit forgery here. 

Picture of modified receipt. My handwriting is underlined in BLUE and hers is underlined in RED.
i.imgur.com\/RCGen4g.jpg

I came in for a 25-minute massage at the Mandalay Bay Spa on 5\/29\/2017. I meet the masseuse named Daphne. The massage is mediocre and felt a good amount shorter than the 25 minutes I paid for. At the end I had no desire to tip her and I just sign the receipt and write down the total $90.00 which is the price of the massage. At this point the gratuity field is blank. Upon checking out of the Spa I learn that there was a $10.00 tip added to make the total $100.00. I request to see the original which I now find has been modified (highly likely by the masseuse Daphne but perhaps by someone else at Mandalay Bay Spa). 

Attached is the picture of the receipt. Note the following observations:  

    1) Zeros
        - Her zeros (red) all have tails at the top going to the right. This is indicative of someone who writes their zeros in a clockwise direction.
        - My zeros (blue) have no tail or tails going toward the left. That is because I write my zeros in a counterclockwise direction. 

    2) Superscripted Cents
        - She writes her cents with superscripted zeros. 
        - I write my zeros the same whether they be in the cents field or not

    3) Proof by contradiction
        - Suppose I wrote that $100.00 in the total field. Note the second number in that total. It looks like a 9 that can be passed off as a 0. That character     has a distinct tail going downward. There is no logical reason why I would write that zero so differently from the other  zeros in any scenario let alone in the same number. Spoiler alert: Its a 9. 

I assume she thought I was some punk 24 year old who doesn't look at his receipts. No lady I'm a meticulous 24 year old computer scientist and I could pick my 1's and 0's out of a line up. Writing a tip in on a receipt that I signed is a clear example of theft and fraud. Beyond stealing from your customers this incident also plays the ironic tune of giving your customer a headache coming out of the ""relaxing"" Mandalay Bay Spa.

I am seeking the immediate termination of those involved committing the crime and I am also calling for an investigation to a likely reoccurring crime. While I've had $10 dollars stolen from me who knows how long they have been stealing from customers.  The accumulation of this fraudulent behavior could lead range from hundreds to thousands of dollars from customers.",14,3,0

I noted throughout our stay the casino didn't smell like cigarettes like others. The buffet I would give a 7- it was okay, nothing amazing. The Border Grill was wonderful and we ordered room service - breakfast was great; late night food mediocre.  It seemed to be a real hassle getting a good meal at 11:00 pm. Our eating schedule was off so that's when we were hungry. Most places were closed. I thought Vegas had more late night options and was disappointed. The staff is wonderful and my son loved the beach\/wave pool. It's hard to find a lounge chair if you get out around noon. It gets so hot, by 1:00 we were done (2hours). The room was comfortable and we definitely enjoyed or stay. Good hotel for families and those wanting a quieter stay- not a loud party hotel- which is what I was looking for. 


DRAWBACKS:The never ending line at check in- took an hour and our room wasn't ready. Every time we walked by, the line was always that long. We went to Border Grill to get lunch. I was told they would call us when the room was ready. After lunch I went back to check- room was ready- thanks for not calling. Not the greatest start. 

Too far from the strip to walk- the monorail isn't the greatest option because you have to walk long distances from the back of the hotel (where station is) to the strip and then cross to hotel. There are six stops (I think) but some not that close to hotels. And monorail ends at MGM- the free tram near Mandalay Bay only goes to Luxor and Excaliber so you have to cross the street and walk forever to back of MGM to transfer. Next time, I will drive.

Jacuzzi tub

Minus one star because House Keeping kept opening our door at weird times, like 9 in the morning (who's up that early in vegas?) and 11 pm and walking in on us. 

Also, even though there is a mini-fridge in your room you are not supposed to use it. We did. We put out 60 dollar box of Vosges chocolates in it and apparently ended up jostling the two budweisers that were in there off their sensors which resulted in the hotel charging us for them.

I have never paid for a room or the buffet here, so I'm not sure how expensive it is. I know they give deals ALL of the time as well as free upgrades. Your best bet is to tip like $20 and you'll get upgraded.

My best friend's dad spends tons of money here so we always stayed in a suite and got free meals. Fun stuff.

I LOVE the beach, it's excellent. Just to be lazy or have fun running around near the water.

They only let people in if they each have a room key, though. Or that's how it was when I went. Kind of a bummer, especially if you're bikini-clad with no pockets.

The bathrooms are AMAZING! I love the tub, which is adorned with awesome products. Not just the typical shampoo\/conditioner and a crappy bar of soap. I took home a sewing kit, bath crystals and a fizzy bath ball.

One complaint...I was rooming with 3 young male adults. There is a significantly large crack in the bathroom door gap (double doors). Why is this a problem? You can see everything past those doors! Shower, tub, sink, everything. I had to squeeze towels between the doors so they wouldn't see, and they did the same.
You can be on the bed closest to those doors and see the person in the bathroom naked without even trying.

Mandalay Bay sucks because it's super far from everything else. Like, we walked almost a mile to get to the nearest Walgreens. In case you aren't aware, there's a tram that runs between MB, Excalibur, and Luxor, and is a relatively quick way to get to the T-Mobile Arena if you're going there as well.

I woke up early on Saturday and got ready for the fights. I went to get some ice in the vending area on the 8th floor. After I filled the ice container I turned to walk away and WHACK I hit the floor. I didn't fall....I didnt slip....I crashed. I guess the hotel thinks its a really good idea to put super slick tile in the ice vending are (where ice falls to the floor and melts into water) and not add any anti-slip mats. STUPID!!

They said they would send someone to my room immediately. Because I waited so long for some security guy to show up I was late to the fights. They didnt send anyone to my room until almost 430. Were they waiting until I for sure wouldnt be there? 

The security guy acted like I was a huge inconvenience....making it seem like I did something wrong and that everything was my fault. I filled out a report...its been almost 2 weeks now and I haven't heard back from anyone. Helloooo????

( We chose the latter, and that was a huge mistake, but you can read the review on the MGM Yelp site) Anyway, he informed us that there was also an open bar option for $90.00 more a piece and we purchased them also. He was extremely good at his job talking to us about the Raiders moving to Las Vegas ( as Raider fans we are excited about this since we plan to relocate to the Vegas area when my fiancé retires) and about the new hockey team that begins playing next year, while waiting for out tickets to print. There was a slight delay, but after a phone call he handed us our tickets for the fight and our bar tickets in an envelope and told us to enjoy the fight!
 Awesome experience! Thank you Teddy!!!",0,0,0

The checkin process was quick and easy with a complimentary bottle if water. Went up to the room, and was pleased with the set up. Just wished there was a bottle if bubble bath to use in the sunken tub. 

Pool area was pretty cool. Learned the first day that you got to go out early and get your spot, because it fills up quick. Make sure you go buy an inter-tube for the lazy river and bring it with you. They sell them for $20+. I remember when they were free rentals (okay 20 years ago, but still). The lazy river gets packed with little ones pushing their way through, while trash swirls at your feet. And watch out, there are places on the bottom floor that are uneven. I happened to step just on that and almost broke my toe. Overall, I was happy...kids were happy. 

My only gripe is that housekeeping didn't bother taking out our old towels that I placed by the front door. I called the front desk and told them we didn't need any servicing, just new towels. It just makes sense if you're bringing in new, take out the old. But, whatever, we weren't in the room all that much.",1,1,0

It's classy without being too exclusive or ridiculously priced. Don't get me wrong, your going to pay a pretty penny for your room, but it's going to be worth it. If you don't something satisfactory, just let 'em know...they'll usually fix it. Most of their staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Many that I've spoken to have worked their since it opened, which I think says a lot.

So here's some of my favorite of Mandalay Bay's qualities:

the Spa: this is the BEST SPA I've ever experienced...I've been to a few here and there, and I don't think you're going to find any better value. Splurge; get an hour-long massage, and allow yourself extra time after the massage to really enjoy the spa. Yes, it's actually a SPA. There are small pools of varying temperatures surrounded by big, comfy lounge chairs. Also, there's a steam room, cold towels, juices, water, fruits, a quiet room, and full showers and vanity supplies. Here's the perfect Rx for a Vegas hangover: get all warmy in the hot, tub, then wrap uo in a fluffy spa robe,  lay back in your lounge chair, and allow the sounds of soothing music and water falling to lull you into sweet slumber. Aaaaahhh.

Restaurants: Yum. Haven't had a bad meal (well, except of House of Blues, which is technically not run by Mandalay Bay). Love love love Stripsteak, China Grill. Also, Red, White & Blue is decent, so is Raffles. Have always wanted to try Aureole. I'd stay away from the food court (at the far end, by the convention center). Room service is also VERY good. If you're more interested in paying for food than ambiance, just do room service...it's awesome.

Casino: clean, smells great, not too noisy

Bars: Red Square & Forty Deuce are both fun scenes. Not a fan of Rum Jungle. House of Blues can be fun if there's a good band and you're at least 2 sheets. The Foundation Room is good, if just for the thrill of saying you got in (it's only open to members or VIP's). It's pretty much just a standard bar, but with a fabulous view of Las Vegas.

the Pool: Love the pools, wave pool (beach), and lazy river. Now they also have a beachside casino. Haven't had a chance to try that out yet. However, the entire pool area has become totally overpopulated and it can be extremely difficult to find seating, particulalrly in summer. Be warned...you may have to get there early.",0,0,0

When I first came here as a kid, I thought this hotel was so luxurious and fancy but I guess I didn't realize it isn't that special. It is definitely very fancy looking but not much stood out to me that differentiated from other hotels.

The billing came out ok since we sent in receipts for reimbursement. Make sure you don't pick up the extra snacks on the table, it automatically charges your account because of the weight.

Since I visited in the winter, we didn't do much at Mandalay Bay because it was so cold but if it was the summer or is warmer, I would definitely stop by their ""Beach""-like pool, very cool.",0,0,0

Let's start with The valet service. I asked the guy to please leave my car up front and he proceeded to tell me in an unprofessional rude way that it would cost me an extra 40 bucks and he needed to be paid up front. And if I didn't have a black card I have to pay cash. His delivery in the way he told me this was so unprofessional and borderline rude. The $40 upfront fee is over and above the $20 per night fee at the Mandalay Bay if you valet park your car. I honestly don't even remember him saying welcome to the Mandalay Bay, enjoy your stay, or even a smile on his face. I paid and Now moving on - that's one strike. 

Proceeding to check in, we waited for an 1 hour and 3 minutes to just get to the counter to check in! It was absolutely ridiculous!! They were completely understaffed ( by the way they had 11 stations open without any employees) and a line of people - that look like we are waiting for a flight.  And mind you I paid extra for an early check in. When I asked to speak with the manager ""Jason"" he acted as if he could care less, again I was dumbfounded at the lack of customer service at this hotel - That is strike two- 

We had a spa appointment at 5 o'clock they told us to be 15 minutes early I had made these reservations on the telephone. When we got there they proceeded to take us on a tour of the spa letting us know that we could utilize any other part of the spa the sauna the hot tub the Jacuzzi (say what) however they never told us that on the phone, so again customer service is not one of their strong points at this hotel! Or we would have been there st 4 and relaxed! 

Even being this was a turn-around trip, they set the precedents and placed a bad taste in my mouth from the get go - and when I say that, I truly mean by the time I pulled in.  So all in all - this seemingly beautiful hotel, became not so beautiful ""from a far it looks great- but far from good"" Two thumbs down!  complete disappointment! And a waste of my money! And the customer service - well there is none!! And the all news to take a class in customer service, over and above preparing better for weekends, who has over 20 ( give or take ) check in stations at the front desk and only has 11 employees there checking in people - It makes absolutely no sense at all- poor management that's who!

When I walked in the restroom, the bathtub was yellow and had multiple stains and what seemed to be cigarette ashes.

1. The hotel pool is great! I loved the fake sand and lazy river. There were a lot of children around so if you don't like kids you might want to think of another pool. 
2. There are a lot of wonderful restaurants to choose from within the hotel. My favorite was Lupo (Italian). 
3. It's easy to get free drink coupons from the concierge. Standing in line at the front desk will get you free drinks easily. Pretty much anything that goes slightly wrong in your stay, ask for something free in exchange. 
4. $75 at any Mandalay restaurant. I got this great deal by booking the hotel through jet blue. 
6. The room was clean, great bathrooms, comfortable beds. 

Not so good things:
1. You need to put down a deposit to use the mini fridge in your room. 
2. There must have been some construction going on because one morning I woke up to some hammering at around 8am.

I did workout in the morning at the gym downstairs. The gym is very small but big enough to get a good, decent workout early in the morning before stuffing my face with food and alcohol. 

The restaurants downstairs were whatevers. Nothing too special but decent enough to eat in. Ate at the Noodle Shop like 3 times. Seemed like the only place open and close by when drunk.

The pool was awesome. Got a bungalow at Daylight. Had an amazing time. Spend way too much money but was way fun.  Drank way too much but worth it. All my friends had a wonderful time.

My name is Zavier, I stayed at your Mandalay Bay resort last Friday, September 9th, 2016 room 18-110 for one night. It was our family vacation and my first time staying at the Mandalay Bay resort. I have a 18 month old son who loves to swim. Both his grandmother's came on our trip, I booked a two bedroom villa suite at Marriott Grand Chateau for them. A non-smoking, non-casino (I enjoy cigars and like to gamble) resort to babysit my son at night, that was our agreement. I pay for their stay and gas and they watch my son at night, so my soon to be wife and I can have a nice stay and enjoy our first adult time in Las Vegas since Zachary was born. So, even though I already technically had TWO rooms in a beautiful villa suite with more than enough room for all of us in Las Vegas for two nights, I still decide to pay for your hotel room. I specifically chose to stay at your Mandalay Bay establishment for at least one night to see if my son liked the pool i've heard so many good things about. Our trip was going so well for the first part of the day, we literally did everything at the Mandalay Bay resort. Ate at multiple restaurants, went swimming, ordered drinks and ate food at the beach pool, gambled on the tables, shopped in your stores and even partied at your nightclub light on Friday night.
There wasn't much my family and I didn't do on Friday at your hotel until we we're harassed and even my friend Justin ASSAULTED FOR NO REASON by one of your security guards in the latter incident. I work in sales as a sales consultant for Mercedes-Benz of Calabasas, where I can sell a $10,000 car or a $250,000 car on any given day. My point is, Not only do I know 5-star customer service, I also know how to provide 5-star customer service and how important the 5-star experience can be. I received the absolute opposite of that on Saturday morning around 4:00 AM by members of your security after my great experience at LIGHT nightclub at your Mandalay Bay hotel.
This whole disgrace of a situation i'm about to explain was absolutely unessesary. It's very visible on your security footage and cameras, from the early morning of Saturday September 10th, 2016, and seems racially motivated and started with a young, large, Caucasian security guard named Travis. He approached my friend Tiffany and I (small Caucasian female) aggressively, with another security guard as we we're having a conversion about making her night better. She was under the influence of Alcohol from your nightclub LIGHT where she received multiple free drinks tickets from the nice promoters of your club. 
Travis asked her if she knew me and where we were both staying tonight. She answered him yes she knows me and that she was planning to stay in Las Vegas, possibly in my room but was upset with personal matters which were being discussed and talked through. I stated that i'm a guest for the night at this resort and appreciate him doing his job by finding out what's going on but insisted that he had nothing to worry about when it comes to her (Tiffany) and I. Tiffany and I discussed and agreed your security guard didn't believe\/didn't want to believe that nothing, absolutely nothing was wrong after we both told him and the other officer that everything is fine and we're having a regular 4:30AM after nightclub drinks ""lets all be happy conversion"".
We proceeded to order food at a restaurant call citizen where she would sit down with my sister and my fiancé Sascha. I went back to the bar where I was enjoying my friends and about 20 minutes later the real racially motivated problem escalated.
My good friend and colleague Another young, African-American man like myself who I work with named ""Justin"" was approached by the same security officer Travis. These were Travis' his exact words ""give me your ID"". Justin proceeded to say why do I need to do that? And in these exact words, your security officer Travis responded to my friend by saying ""give me your fucking ID!"" while approaching him aggressively for no justifiable reason. That alone is un-acceptable but it escalade even further for no reason thanks to your security guard Travis.
I was still at the bar and he approach my friend Justin while he was standing alone. Once I heard your security officer Justin aggressively approach Justin and say ""Give me your fucking ID!"" I immediately left the bar to differ the situation.

Reached the limit on the text for the review but long story short my buddy Justin was assaulted by a security officer once we exited!",0,0,0

I was looking forward to staying here during the summer months to take advantage of the ""beach"" and we came here in August... so... ""beach, here we come!"", but it wasn't that easy.

CHECK-IN:
Check-in time didn't take more than 30 mins (wait and service) and the guy even hooked us up with a strip view room on the 33rd floor so that was great off the bat.

BEACH: 
I was wrong about trying to go to the pool after noon. NO SEATS.
In order to get decent seats, we got up at 6am (really? i'm on vacation!) and got in the forming line of patrons waiting to get in. We opted for the west lagoon pool to avoid the loud children in the wave pool and lazy river. It was pretty good being able to sit in the sun before noon because after that, the temperature was sure to hit 105. I was fairly comfy sitting there, sipping on my daquiri in 85 degree heat.
We attempted to go to the beachside casino, but it was closed... sign of the times... not enough servers or dealers.

THE ELEVATORS
As long as ur travelling up and down outside of ""rush hours"", you're fine, traffic-wise.  the only gripe i had was the fact that when we were in one of the elevators, it got stuck before it completely hit a floor and the doors wouldn't open. not cool.

THE ROOM
It felt roomier than average. Our The 550 square foot Deluxe Room overlooked the strip and was really a basic hotel room, except that it had his and hers closets, an unneccessary telephone next to the shitter and a flat screen tv in the bathroom. It also featured a separate shower and bathtub. I took advantage of the fairly large bathtub, soaked in bubble bath fresh from LUSH and watched tv because what the hay? tv in the bathroom? We didn't spend much time in the room, but I had no complaints. Housekeeping kept everything clean and didn't touch what didn't need to be touched.

What I really appreciated about this hotel is the fact that there were NO timeshare peddlers in the actual hotel (yes, I know they are lurking in mandalay place, but unlike its sister properties, there aren't any waiting for me to walk by so they can ask if me and my boyfriend are married and are interested in timeshares.)

I wasn't that impressed by the buffet because the line was ridiculously long and people were confused about how to pay (there was a choice via kiosk or cashier). Some people who bought all-day buffet bracelets were even more confused about things than everyone else. When we were finally seated, I was in a better mood (because I was being fed) and our waiter was hella nice. Typical buffet food, but the pasta station was awesome! 

We stayed here because we were lucky enough to get a $69\/night promo, but if I want a place where I can freely get some sun time by the pool, I'd go somewhere less overrated. Location is ok because its at an extreme end of the strip, but we only travelled as far as MGM Grand (to see KA) & NY NY (to gamble).

Oooh,  after checking out and before hopping in a cab, I put $20 on black @ a roulette table and won! yea, boy!",0,0,0

I know that is sad to say but I've been going every year for YEARS that we would just stay where ever we could get the best deals on rooms.  So I guess that means that it was unforgettable.  Because I do remember staying at the Luxor, Cesar's, treasure island, etc...

Anyways, we stopped by to have drinks at the Red Square, and I would have to say that it was worth the visit.  Otherwise, I didn't see anything else that stood out or caught my attention.",1,0,1

Many rooms seem to come with large bathtubs, which is awesome. It's really a nice property. 

However, the service at Mandalay Bay, though not the worst I have ever encountered, leaves something to be desired. 

Upon check in, the front desk went out of their way to put me in my place for asking for my free meal vouchers (part of the package I booked). 

The staff (not including housekeeping, who were super nice) just seemed very pretentious and smug. It was annoying, to say the least. When you pay $200+ a night for a hotel room (in Las Vegas, where perfectly nice rooms are always available less than $100 a night), you expect great customer service. 

We requested a late checkout the day we were supposed to depart (due to a canceled flight) and were told it would cost extra, even after explaining the situation. We weren't asking for a free night or anything, just a couple of extra hours. 

It was not to be.

The gaming floor is great. They probably have one of the most comfortable sports books on the Strip. The decor is nice. The rooms are nice. If only the staff wasn't so horrid.

The only other crazy annoyance about Mandalay Bay is how long it takes to get a down elevator every morning. Having stayed at many hotels in Las Vegas, I will admit that it can, at times, take a few minutes anywhere. At Mandalay Bay, every day we left the room between 10 a.m. and noon, it took no less than 8 minutes for an elevator (that was not totally full) to appear. One day it took nearly 15 minutes. Take the stairs, you say? Sure! 30+ flights of stairs, NO SWEAT. You would think in Las Vegas, land of incredible engineering and adult magic, they would have some sort of solution to this problem...",2,0,0

What I really appreciated after our crappy 3 night stay at The Linq, was the wonderful service we received from the reception staff. They smiled, made eye contact, made quick small talk, and were friendly AND efficient. The room was beautiful and spacious and the bathroom was awesome as there was a bath, stand up shower, double sinks, and an extra mini bathroom area with a door for the toilet. I loved the casino and the assortment of slots! The drink hostesses were quick, friendly, and attentive. Loved our stay here, would definitely visit again for a longer stay.",0,0,0

The room itself was nice. We got a king bed with a view of the pool which came in handy when we wanted to see how full the pool was. FYI if you go to the pool go when it opens because it'll get mad packed. It opened at 8am and was packed by like 10am no joke. 

The only thing I didn't really like IMO was the bathroom. You have to get used to no privacy. lol. The shower and toilet are separated. If you're claustrophobic forget using the toilet. And if you like privacy in the bathroom you can forget that too because who ever's staying with you can totally see you through both the window AND the door.",2,0,1

The beds were wonderful and comfortable.  The bed is the most important part of my trip.. I love the fluffly down goose blankets and pillows that they provide.. I like extra pillows too..

Room service was a blast to order and to just bum around before taking a walk on the entire strip and playing games at circus circus!

favorite part of the hotel: the beach imitation like pool with the waves and sand.  that was a good effect for a summer weekend trip!!  

The facilities are very clean and modern.  It shows that it is one of the newer hotels compared to like Excalibur and such..Many restaurants to choose from, which i tried Aureole!!

Disadvantage: this hotel is the last one on the strip.. it isn't located right in the middle or anything.. so get ready for some walking!!

I definitely recommend staying at this hotel.. just dont mind taxi-ing or walking a bit more than usual to the places you want to go to.. exercise!! we all need it after those buffets that everyone splurges on anyways!! :)",3,3,3

The casino floor is huge and not too smoky.  In fact, they pump some nice smelling scent through the ventilation system.... Can't place my finger on what scent it is exactly but I like it.  The entire building from inside to out is beautiful.

There are restaurants for every occasion and budget.  Ok, so maybe nothing super cheap, but you can definitely find some more affordable places here.  

You have Shark Reef for entertainment, they have tons of concerts come through, and it has one of the best pools in Vegas.  

I used to visit Mandalay a lot more a few years ago, but sadly they have closed Forty Deuce and the menu at Burger Bar has taken a turn for the worse.  I really hope they change things up soon since they closed ""The Lion King"" and have had Rum Jungle sitting vacant for a couple years.  I think they are cruising by with business from the conventions and not trying to innovate.

I stayed in a suite about five years ago right after they remodeled their rooms.  It was huge with a comfy bed and gigantic bathtub.  It was a great place to stay and I would recommend it.  I also have been to Mandalay's spa and while it was nice, I preferred the spa at The Hotel much more.

Located on the very south end of The Strip and is a bit of a walk to most other casinos.  Connected to the Luxor through Mandalay Place, or there is a tram that will take you from Mandalay to Luxor or Excalibur.

Oh, and don't go to the buffet.  It's awful.",4,0,0

I lived in a double bed room. nice and spacy. what i was amazed with was the restroom. it had a massage tub and a shower. also equiped with a 20in flat screen TV for you to enjoy while your in the massage tub. 

The room itself has a 36""-42"" LCD Wall mounted TV. not really sure the size. It also had an ipod dock for you to listen to music on your own ipod. but it was missing a huge thing. it didn't have a coffee maker or a hot water boiler. WTF? every hotel i've been to has one of these. Also poor design for the bathroom door. they are split double doors with a huge split in the center. you can just peak inside when people are using the restroom. WTF AGAIN?

I love the facility but they need to get their act together.  I booked the Lion King package and had to change the given showtime.  When I called I was told since I booked on the Internet my seats weren't assigned yet so they couldn't change it.  I called again a few days later and was told thru a supervisor that I had to go thru TicketMaster (which didn't make any sense).  TicketMaster confirmed that wasn't true.  Later, a Tara from Mandalay Bay called to apologize I was given the wrong information and was able to make the change for me.  When I went to pick up my tickets as will call, they initially couldn't find them.  I think their IT system needs some improvement.

The swimming pools were very hot to hot to even cool off in, the lazy river was disappointing because you had to buy a raft to float on so everybody just walks around the river rather then float on tubes. The wave pool was pretty cool to hang out in and you can even body surf the small waves.

Really, Mandalay Bay? You can't even have a few that are free on a first-come, first-serve basis? I mean, I know it's Vegas, but this is ridiculous even for Vegas! Help a pale sister out. There was no way I could hang in the hot Vegas sun without a little shade.

The other downer about Mandalay Bay is you don't realize how far down the strip it is until you stay there and plunk down $20 per cab ride to get anywhere toward the middle of the strip. On my last trip, I stayed at Paris and - while the rooms sucked by comparison - we could be at almost any other casino in 10 min or so of walking there.

One final bummer, for me anyway - this is not a card player's casino. I tried on several occasions to get into a limit Texas Hold 'Em game, and they just weren't happening at Mandalay Bay. Overall, gambling here seemed kind of slow compared to other casinos I visited on my trip.

 I would definitely take these things into consideration before returning to Mandalay Bay.",1,0,2

Newly renovated room as you can see from the other pictures posted.  Overall, a 3.5 star rating only because I really just want a clean room and bed.  I give a 5 star rating to Ariel; the front desk receptionist.  I respect and enjoy folks who like what they do, have a positive attitude, and provide service with a big smile.  She had all of those... plus recommendations for dinner.

Now, for the casino... I have to give it 1 star.  I usually only play table games... and I must say... every single dealer looked\/was mean, mad, and just plain unpleasant.  Just seems odd at how much these guys hated their job.  I've played here before, as well as, other MGM properties and have met really nice, cool, and pleasant dealers... so maybe this was an off night.

Evidently ANY dirt inside or out results in a fee. It's completely up to them to decide if you get the fee. This is ridiculous! It's just a scam to get more money on top of the extra they charge for the ""Convenience"" of renting at the hotel. Then to top it off, the car we got was dirty on the outside with FOOD spread around the inside. To avoid the ""FEE"" we cleaned the car. What a great SCAM- rent dirty cars then charge people if they don't clean them up!

Stayed there at least six times between 2000 and 2010; never had any troubles and never a single complaint. However, after our trip this past Thanksgiving, we are absolutely disgusted at the service (or lack thereof), we received. 

Made reservations online, well in advance of trip. Followed-up with a telephone call to insure reservation would be appropriate for our situation (traveling with a disabled adult, and a disabled minor who each have special needs). Upon calling, customer service was excellent. Based on information we provided, they graciously explained the reservation would not work for us and kindly swapped us to other accommodations and worked hard to keep the charges to what we had already expected to pay. Unfortunately, this is where the excellent service ended. 

Mandalay Bay's check in time is 3:00 p.m. We arrived at approximately 5:00 p.m. to a registration line about an hour and a half long. Knowing my disabled family members needed to sit down and relax (and it was clear there was not one seat available in the lobby), my wife called concierge to see if we were eligible to express registration since we are M Life and ""total rewards"" members. Concierge said ""no"", so we then proceeded to ask if we could pay a fee to expedite registration due to the disability-related needs of our family members. Concierge advised they could not handle this so they asked us to call ""reservations"". Then, we called reservations to be placed on hold for an inordinate amount of time so they could figure out their answer. Ultimately, we were told ""no"" because we did not request this accommodation at least 24 hours in advance. Thus, we waited in line.

When we finally made it up to the registration desk we were told the renovated suite we reserved WAS NOT READY (registration was at 3:00, right?)! By this point my wife was irate because our disabled children were becoming ill. The woman working registration realizes this and offers us an unrenovated room AT THE SAME COST! When we asked why we were not getting a discount due to the downgrade in room, we were told ""because this room faces the strip"". By now....who cares about a strip view???  Whatever, we took the room.  I am sure they think they made this whole fiasco up to us by ""throwing in"" the roll away we requested, NOT! 

Now, as if this all was not enough, the room was weathered, and in disrepair. Nope, we did not bother to report this during our stay, as we had no intention of having repair people in our space while we were trying to relax, nor were we going to expend our energy to relocate. 

After our miserable stay, my wife received an email requesting we participate in a survey. Bingo, they asked, and we let loose. We listed all of the aforementioned, and their response? Sorry about the condition of the room; we'll refund you $100. Talk about missing the mark, failure, appalling customer service, etc. Clearly their staff are poorly trained. I could care less about the money. Their first concern should have been attempting to meet the needs of disabled travelers and second, meeting their 3:00 commitment to having guest rooms ready. Needless to say, neither we, nor anyone in our sphere of influence will be staying at Mandalay or their affiliates ever again. I am quite sure we aren't the only ones.",2,2,2

Our room was great - huge HDTV flatscreen, big bathroom (with another tv set - score!) alarm clock with built in iPod dock.  When we checked in we asked for a room up high...not only did we get that but also a pool view.

A couple of tips - 
#1 Definitely request a room with a pool view and close to the elevator when you check in.

#2 Double check your bill before you leave the room...they had charged us $30 for mini bar items that we didn't drink because they have sensors in the fridge that could tell we lifted the bottles up to take a look at them (mini Patron bottles are so damn cute!)
They promptly reversed the charges as soon as we told them what happened.

We were staying with a group of friends, so I was happy with their choice of MB as our hotel.  It's nice without being over the top, the decor is tasteful and it doesn't smell bad!  I'm not a gambler, but did have fun playing at the $15 blackjack tables.  I was more interested in their POOL and have separate reviews for those (Mandalay Bay Beach & Moorea Beach Club).  Yes, MB is at the end of the Strip... but it's convenient that you can walk to Luxor and take the tram to Excalibur to make your way down the strip.

The rooms are much bigger than most hotel rooms.  Our bathroom had dual sinks and a full size tub separate from the shower.  Be careful with the mini bar since it's weight monitored = take something out & you might get charged for it!  I liked our pool view and it was a great way to wake up.  They have multiple Elevator Bays for levels 2-16, 17-34, etc.  Be sure to push the door close button in elevators to save some time.  Door key cards are magnetic, so be careful with your magnetic closures on wallets & purses.  I forgot that my ""travel"" purse has a magnetic closure and had to get a new door card after mine stopped working.

Crazy long lines at Starbucks, so check out the Orchid Lounge for your morning coffee fix.  Also my favorite (non-fancy) restaurant in Vegas is Burger Bar at Mandalay Place.  You have to check it out.  All in all, I was happy with my stay and I would definitely stay at MB again!

I was here for a convention and spent serious dough on this trip and wanted to be rested for the presentation so we had a drink and went to the room and went in.

The toilet wouldn't flush (embarrassing since bunking with a coworker). The shower door was loose and near falling off the hinge. Decor was worn. Bed was comfortable and pillows were nice.

We are MLife members and we frequently come to Vegas. About 5-6 times a year. I like to think we are familiar with what to expect in Vegas and we are good customers. 

We walked into our first room and it was ok. The view was nice from the 32nd floor. The decor was standard fair - neutral color palate and nothing fancy. But, there were a few problems. It was a non smoking floor and there were people smoking. Not the hotel's fault, but I called guest services to notify them. I also let them know that the door knob to the closet came off the door when it was opened. I told guest services we were running out for the evening and asked that they remedy the situation while we were gone. 

We returned around 11:30pm to close out a long day (we flew out from the East coast at 5am and were very much done for the night). The room next door was having a party. Not an ""invite you over for a beer"" party but a very loud party with about 20 people - young children and adults. At about midnight my husband and I were not having the noise any longer, so we called downstairs and asked that they shut down the next door party. We called a half hour later and asked again. We called a half hour later and asked again. Nothing. I called at almost 2am and asked to switch rooms. They said they would move us down from the 32nd floor to something in the teens. Our neighbors were unbearable and we lose our high floor and view? 

My husband went downstairs to resolve the issue. Apparently my diplomatic and female(?) approach did not work. My husband was able to switch the room to the 30th floor. At 2am. BTW - packing at 2am is as fun as it sounds. They comped us the room for the night and our resort fee. They also told my husband that we were not the only ones to complain. While reassuring to know I am not a jerk, it sucked to know that we (and others) were the ones inconvenienced. 

It is the next morning in our room. The smoke alarm starts going off. There is no smoke. We called downstairs. Maintenance comes up about 10 minutes later. He said the alarm went off because we took a hot shower - the steam set it off. Hmm. Whatever. The alarm is off now and it won't go off again - right?

We had a busy day and decided to watch MNF in the room. Smoke alarm! We call downstairs and wait. And wait. And wait. We call again. Apparently maintenance didn't knock on the door because the privacy sign was on the outside door knob. Note: the smoke alarm is going off. Maintenance comes in after we remove the sign. After actually looking at the alarm this time, he notices that it was running on battery power not DC power. The alarm was not plugged in and the battery had died.  Sigh. 

Do I complain again? No. I will probably be moved again after I am ignored and my husband complains at the front desk. 

I did need to call one more time because the closet door would not stay shut causing the light to stay on. I propped it closed with a decorative pillow. And the blackout curtains would not close (the track was broken so the curtains stayed open about 2 feet). Totally awesome when the sun hits the window at 6:30am. Sigh.

Where to begin? Let's start with prices this casino hotel is out of control everything is an extra charge and it's not a small 9-15 bucks it's around 25-30. They have a utter crap cardio room and then a full gym. The gym is 25 dollars per day. And other charges like that for things you think would be covered in the 35.99 charge per day for pool spa and gym would assume I shouldn't have to pay more to use the facilities I already paid for. 

Everything in the pictures in the pool area was closed. Their basic pool was open which was completely packed. It frankly needs to be listed when your claim to fame on the strip is having the best pool area hands down and it's closed. This is like being voted best casino on the strip and having everything down but penny slots. The pool they had open was what you would expect from a standard Hilton. When asked why the wave pool\/ beach was not open they said was due to bad weather? You can have the basic pool open but not the wave pool on a bright sunny day? Ok...

Upon entering our room I always put my shoes under the bed old army habit and I found trash and a perfume box in the top rack of the closet which was in open site. This could just be a one time event I didn't make a fuss about it. However it makes you wonder if the basic things are being done fresh towels and sheets etc.  

Finally the Buffett was a complete rip off. Ate at Friday dinner. I like paying the extra bit for dinner because they usually have better items. This was a huge let down. They did to their credit have all you could drink wines which most casino buffets have. The offerings were small best item there was smoked salmon. Had cheap items like personal pizzas and things you would expect from a golden coral and same quality with the exceptions of deserts.

Pros of staying at this Hotel:
*Wave Pool -wave pool is awesome!  (would not stay here unless the pools are open!)
*Beds and rooms are good
*Rooms are nice and spacious
*Valet is quick in retrieving your car
*Beautiful views at night.
*You can use your own tubes in the lazy river.  The pool store has an air pump you can use to blow up your own tubes.  VERY NICE!
*Our hotel floors have almost always been very quiet. 

Cons:
*Wave pool lounge chairs are a joke!  Many guest get up at 7am and go out and put towels on the chairs to ""Save"" chairs.  By 11 am all of the chairs are ""saved"", even if there is no one sitting on them. There are signs that say not to save chairs, but it is a serious problem if 100% of the chairs are taken all the time.  The hotel really needs to have a person who watches the guests in the mornings and removes the towels when they leave the pool area!  
*Wave pool is only open from the First Sunday in March-Mid November.  
*The only pool open from mid November-March is Morrea.  The pool is heated but so cold that only a few brave kids would swim in it, and the hot tub is lukewarm with too many people jammed into it.
*sinks gurgle at night and can be quite loud.  We had to close the sink trap, and put a wet towel in it to keep it quiet!
*Airplane noises!  Usually starts about 6am when planes start taking off from the nearby airport, and the jet noise can be loud.
*Staff isn't as honest as you may think.  Make sure you LOCK UP your stuff and don't leave anything in your room that is valuable!

PROS:
The rooms were pretty nice.
The bathrooms were exceptional.
The food options within the walkway between adjacent hotels are numerous.

CONS:
The pool area is a complete clusterf*ck from a design standpoint. All that water available with nowhere near the amount of chairs or open deck space to accommodate the demand. There were, literally, 400 people in line to make the mad dash for chair space at the 9:00am opening. You are completely screwed if you are not willing to wait in line for a half hour before it opens.

In addition, the pool area layout is difficult to navigate, the poolside service sucks and they have way too many private or 18+ areas that were essentially unused. I wish they could start from scratch and redesign what was supposed to be their main attraction. Massive fail.

The bell service upon departure was horrid. I waited 40 minutes for a bell hop to come to my room. They should bump up their staffing.

The check out line (we had a billing error) was 50 deep and only 2 check out desks available. Horrible. I ended up doing Express Checkout and handling the billing error when I got home. 

Overall, we were sort of disappointed. Unfortunately, we won't go back. There are too many other choices out there now. We'll go back to Mirage which seems to have a better designed pool area.

Two living room areas had plenty of seating. The two rooms are so far apart from each other that both rooms can be playing music on the iHome speakers and you couldn't hear them both at the same time (each bedroom has its own iHome speaker). There are a total of 4 flat screen TVs in the room, and plenty of USBs and outlets to charge all of your devices. Super clean bathrooms and bedrooms were spacious.

The pros are that it's a great hotel with a moderately cheaper fee than other hotels on the Strip, but the con is that it is all the way at the end of the strip (Which isn't that big of a con).

What they don't tell you when you reserve the hotel online is that the hotel service fee are added to your bill on top of the total price when checking out online. I think it was around $180 extra. Be sure to call in and ask if you have any questions about the hotel service fee.

It's a little far down the strip but the accommodations were very nice. Probably the most comfortable bed I have slept in at a hotel. I really like my bed plush and engulfing and the bed at Mandalay was just that. The linens were soft unlike generic hotel sheets that rip off your skin. The rooms and bathroom were cleaned nicely with the exception that they never left enough towels. This was the only frustrating point of my whole stay. Very nice flat screen LCD televisions in both the bedroom and bathroom. And there was plenty of lighting unlike my room at Caesars. Don't touch anything in the mini bar because you'll get charged for it (pretty standard). We went ahead and had ours locked so as to not be tempted to touch anything, LOL. 

We spent two full days out by the pool. I suggest reserving cabanas when you make your hotel reservations to ensure you get what you want. We reserved ours when we booked our rooms and had plenty of options to choose from and cabana check-in is much easier when you have a reservation. We had a cabana for both days on the West Lagoon. I highly recommend this location as its convenient to the lazy river and wave pool without being in the loud, overcrowded areas near the lazy river and beach. The West Lagoon was a nice place to chill in the cabana and just relax. If you don't get a cabana prepare to get down to the pool at 9 am when they open or you won't get a chair. Oh yeah, and even if you have your stuff on a chair and walk away people will steal them. Be sure to have someone guarding your stuff at all times or you'll come back to it on the ground with your chairs taken. 

The lazy river wasn't really that lazy. It moves at a rather brisk pace and there are tons of kids in there shrieking and being crazy. But its a hotel known for its pool so of course its going to attract families on vacation. The wave pool was lame. The waves are hardly waves but still a cool place to hang out and talk. It wasn't overly packed like the lazy river which was nice. I probably enjoyed my time in the West Lagoon pool the most. Also, don't come to Mandalay Bay looking for hot and sexy eye candy. It's mostly families and those average in looks. There may be some hotties in the adult Morena club and European pool area but I never made it over there. 

The cabana service was great overall. We had excellent coverage of our cabana on Monday. Our server probably came by 10 times an hour to make sure we had everything we needed and Li our cabana host was awesome. On Wednesday the service was a little slower. They explained that they were a little short handed because they didn't expect it to be so busy based on the number of cabanas that had been pre-reserved. They were really nice about it and did the best the could to tend to our cabana. We were on vacation and didn't care much anyway. 

The breakfast buffet was pretty standard. The deserts were excellent. I recommend anything chocolate. One bad thing about Mandalay is that they only sell Pepsi products...this was a problem for me all over Vegas since I am a loyal Diet Coke drinker but I was able to get by with bottles bought from the gas station across the street. 

I didn't gamble in the casino here so I cannot comment on that. My guess is like everywhere else on the strip there are high table limits and you lose your ass. And although it is pretty far down the strip, they offer a free tram between Mandalay, the Luxor, and Excalibur which was great for getting to our dinner reservations at NY NY. Just a quick ride on the tram and a short walk and we were there. Overall I really enjoyed my stay.",1,0,0

The only reason I even gave the hotel 3 stars is because of the pools. I imagine it would be great to stay or maybe visit the pools in the summer. But the food at the pool was gross and over priced. The drinks were weak and over priced, which would be expected at a resort pool. The chicken from my salad was not edible. Also this hotel charges for everything. The tubes at the pool was no different. 

The rooms were okay. Our room was not clean. And we had to ask for towels in the room. The rooms were small and for how beautiful the hotel was the room was okay. 

The unnecessary charges. Well first they charge for a resort fee. THEN THEY STILL CHARGE FOR PARKING. VALET AND SELF PARKING. Also when i asked for one bed instead of two queens, they charged me for that. When I made a reservation I had asked for one king. The guy still charged me. 

Then we decided to stay at the hotel for dinner since it was far south from everything else on the strip. No its not walking distance to other hotels or restaurants. I can't remember the resturants name but its next to the club and red. It had HORRIBLE FOOD. My chicken was pink and my boyfriends salmon had a hair in it. $100 dollar dinner and I could get better food at dennys. It was very disappointing. I hate to send food back and usually just eat it anyway. But my chicken was cold and pink so I couldn't.

Every hotel I stay at in Vegas has a resort fee so I expected that but all the other charges were annoying. Plus it was not worth it. The food and customer service was not great. If I go back I will only be there for the pool.",1,0,0

Clientele there is lots of the younger groups\/partiers(21-30) and more families with young kids. Far less older folks and couples than my stay at cesars. 

-1 Star because the suite we ordered wasnt ready when we showed up, they did however give us 150$ credit (used on buffet) and discounted our suite. 1500 X2. Room wasnt overly impressive but solid nonethless and comporable to other hotel\/suites ive checked out. I was satisifed with compensation for their error.

The pool is simply awesome, tho a bit crowded. 

Buffet is good, lots of good resturants, and the mall that connects to the luxor is nice and convinient. Walk next door to luxor if you want lower gaming limits and to hit the clubs. 

The entire hotel itself has quite a nice atmospher decor and its generally easy to get around.

Casino definitely had a more upscale feel with good service on free drinks and friendly dealers\/pit bosses.

Go to the top floor lounge\/bar for a stunning strip view.

I'd have to say the Mandalay Bay is definitely showing its age and you can see it has weathered the Las Vegas elements over the years.  Its feeling a little old, a little tired, but its still pretty cool.

Old and Tired stuff:
- elevators are so slo o o   o   o w.  There were pretty long lines for them sometimes!
- hotel aesthetics need sprucing up -  getting a little outdated, worn out and dirty
- not too many 'happening' places for drinks and dancing.  They used to have Rum Jungle, but no more.  :(
- kind of a trek to get to the heart of Vegas action, since its all the way at the end of the strip

But still pretty cool for:
- the great rooms.  Comfy.  Dual closets! TV in the bathroom, facing the tub. And as my Yelp friend Alan L. mentioned, the showers have great pressure and that's always a plus for me!  The deep tub was very nice also.
- the only wave pool (and lazy river!?) in Vegas; nice infinity jacuzzi, too.
- its great options for fine dining: Charlie Palmer's Aureole, Hubert Keller's Fleur, Wolfgang Puck's Lupo, Rick Moonen's RM Seafood, and Michael Mina's Stripsteak...not bad, right?
- the wonderful Spa Mandalay.

It was a nice stay here.  I'd recommend it if you get a good deal, and if you don't mind cabbing it to get to where the action is.  Not as young and new as an Aria or Cosmopolitan, but still an illustrious hotel in its own right in Vegas.",13,8,11

This was overlooked the next morning, when they called our room to remind us of our ""11am"" check out time, so we had to then remind them that they had increased it for us.

The worse part was the fact that their room key machine was broken, so they could not issue room keys for us.  Without a room key, the only way to get into the room, was to go to the front desk and have them call a security guard to open the door for us. This was extremely inconvenient..specially when the security guard took forever, and you're drunk and ready to pass out at 5am.

We also received complaints that our room was being noisy, so we received the first strike out of three.  The third strike meaning that we would probably have to stay somewhere else...the thing is, we were not being anywhere near noisy...the noisiness was coming from others that were nearby us.  Lame.

Good: they have a free tram that brings you to the Excalibur, they have great restaurants and shopping, they are nice and courteous, the casino is clean, it's at the end of the strip so it's quiet. The buffet is really good. 

Bad: the toilet room was super dirty and smelled strongly of urine. I asked the maid to clean it and there were still pee spots on the floor and the smell was still strong so I am guessing she didn't.  Toilet water comes  out of the front of the toilet when you flush...It has made our room smell like urine.
The water smells like sewage when you first turned it on. 
The shower was messed up. The pressure was connected to the heat level so you couldn't turn it up very high thus making you have a low pressure shower. 
The shower door made a loud crack every time you opened it. 
The cordless phone didn't work
The alarm clock didn't work

You have to buy you inner tube for the small lazy river for $24.00
The Internet just plain sucks and for $25.00 I expect to not be cut off from it several times a day and constantly have to authenticate my devices AGAIN and AGAIN. 

I have been very sick with a fever the last 3 days. We can't figure out what it is.

My daughter loved the pools, when we weren't at the pool, she sat at the window and stared down at the pool.  The alarms were set, so she could be the first in the lazy river.  I'm surprised that her whole body didn't look like a prune.  She wants to move to Las Vegas and didn't allow me to return the room key, so she can return to the pool.

The room was nice, king size bed, a bunch of TV channels (no Disney tho).  The bathroom was large.  It had tub, shower and separate toilet.  The oddity for me, was the window next to the tub.  It was positioned so that anybody entering\/exiting the room or the adjoining room could see the bather.  There also wasn't any locks on the bath area.  All not a big deal for adults, but could provide a challenge for those with children.

For meals, we mainly ate elsewhere.  The menus in house, were a bit to pricey for me, $19 for a California Roll is too much.  Valet was free and easy, so for us, that was the best option.  After the pools closed, one time I was allowed to gamble a little bit...

Unfortunately, since we didn't know Delano was a different hotel, we waited in line at the Mandalay Bay check-in for over an hour.

It seems that the cool the pools in some way because the Delano's pool was really cold considering it was 108 outside! I wish they'd leave them as is because it was a little too cold, but the wave pool was a nice temp.

Even though the resort is clean, the casino itself is still really stinky, just like most of Vegas.

Their idea of removing down from a room is to drop off a bunch of non down pillows on top of all the down pillows and down comforter on the bed.  The mini bar isn't fully stocked, which seems odd - why leave holes?  The stuff that is there seems old (the chocolate I opened had clearly melted at some point and resolidified).  The elevators take FOREVER and the doors rarely close unless you hold the door close button.  I dunno, if you get a good rate I'm sure it's worth it, but I'm not chomping at the bit to come back.

Came here Friday night for the Social Distortion concert at the House of Blues (which is inside Mandalay Bay). From the time I pulled up.... valet guys were on it.  Guys rushed over to take car and sent bell hop over right away.  When I walked in to check in, you can smell the scent of flowers.  Great first impression.  Check in was super fast too.  Luggage came fast and all the employees were friendly. Room was very clean and also smelled good.  They ask for your email when checking in. When checking out you can check out from that same email.

The rooms have been newly remodeled in the last 2 years or so possibly 3 years. Very contemporary and very modern looking. 

The beds are great and comfy always the first thing I look for. The bathrooms are perfectly situated too. The pool is awesome and great to lay on a chair hung over the whole day and people watch. I love going when its cloudy because there is less people there. The wave pool is fun but you cant go to far out into it. The round pool, not sure what that's called. The one that is constantly going in a circle is usually full so I have only done that one once. 

Do not order room service. I don't mind waiting 45 minutes for my food but I expect it to show up hot. Not have it sitting out for, judging from the temperature, 30 out of the 45 minutes. They could give a crap that I complained.

The girl at check-in insisted I give her the credit card that had booked several of our reservations (my bosses) and I had never been sent a credit card authorization form to differentiate each reservation.
Needless to say by the time I go to my room I was starving, tired and wanted a bite to eat before picking up my packages at the business center. 
I ordered a SALAD (no grilled steak or chicken atop it) and waited over an hour. At that point I had to skedaddle to a meeting and was even more hungry and frustrated and had to call room service and cancel the meal. Luckily I was able to find a bit of trail mix leftover from my flight to sustain me (barely).
From that point on, I was continuously disappointed in what this hotel had to offer with exception to the guys at the bell desk. They were always prompt, positive and just a joy to work with (and I had a lot of packages).
The girl at one of the information desks (when I decided to cut my short at that establishment short) was SO unhelpful in directing me to where I needed to be I was so glad to be out of there forever.

My boyfriend and i of course wanted to eat at nice restaurants, go clubbing at night, and shop in the day time, but our main goal was to chill and have fun.

I'm so glad I stuck to my gut instinct and chose here. We had the best view of the strip from our room, and the best sleep ever.

I stayed at the Palazzo the last time, and it's amazing. the rooms are big, i guess i shouldn't get too deep into this, but i didn't think the pool was all that great. it's a glorified bath tub. and really, who stays in the room all that much? so who cares.... but mandalay bay, the rooms are pretty nice, spacious bathroom, and the best pool ever. it's not a pool! it's a beach! there's a wave pool... oh man, so great. we LOOOVED it.

and if you stay here, you need to order the animal burger at the beach.

- I don't usually write reviews but I definitely felt the need to do so today.  I travel quite often, and have been to Vegas too many times to count.  This was my first stay at Mandalay Bay and I was looking forward to the experience because the pool area is so well reviewed.  

- As with most of my trips this one was a last minute vacation, so I called the hotel directly to book a Spa Suite. 

- I was lured in by the option of paying a fee for early check-in and late check-out, since we were only staying one night I wanted to make the most of it.  

- The reservation clerk assured me that I was guaranteed early check-in, multiple times because if he couldn't arrange it I was more than willing to book another type of suite online and assure I got early check-in, and I told him that.  

- With everything set, my husband and I woke up early, drove to Vegas, got in at 10:30am (I was told the room would be ready by 10am), and attempted to check-in.  

- The room was NOT ready and it seems that the reservation clerk lied!  He never booked the early check-in or late check-out as promised.  I was willing to upgrade to another suite (as I had seen on the website not more than 6 hours earlier) but I was told that there were no other rooms available (although I was able to book another room on my phone when I tried).  They were apologetic and waived my resort fee (little consolation). 
 
- I was checked in, given keys to a ""phantom room"" and told that I would be sent a text message with the room number when my room was ready (I was not a happy camper).  

- We went about our day waiting and waiting and waiting for the text that NEVER came.  At 3pm (which is regular check-in time) I called and was told ""we sent you a text message"".  Funny how theirs is the ONLY text message I did not receive that day.  

- Once we got to our room (which I must say was a nicely laid out room) the smell of cigarette smoke made you gag.  We called the front desk and were assured that this was a non-smoking room.  Unfortunately the previous occupants didn't care to follow the rules and used a shower cap (which was still in place) to cover the smoke detector and smoke to their hearts content.

- The front desk offered to send someone up with an atomizer to deal with the odor (since there were no other rooms available).   An hour later, maintenance shows up and informs us that we would need to leave the room for a couple of hours in order for them to use this atomizer.  WTF? Seriously?????

- To make a LONG story slightly less long...... The next night we called for a blanket that never appeared, we asked for a coffee maker that they could not provide, we requested hot water which they wanted $5.00 for (not including the $2.50 delivery fee), and lately this room, which I waited all day for, had a lovely view of the top of a parking structure. To quote my teenagers......all I can say is WOW, really?

- Needless to say this was my first and LAST stay at Mandalay Bay!  Such a shame that they care so little.",6,2,0

We were staying at MGM that time (definitely wasn't impressed with them) and vowed that the next time we came we would stay at Mandalay Bay, even though it was pretty far down the strip.

The rooms are clean and spacious- to the point where we didn't mind our view of the highway. The tub is HUGE and so luxurious!!! Best part of the whole room!! Beds are comfortable, room is decorated very nicely, and layout is spacious. 

The casino downstairs is well equipped and we noticed that the cigarette smell wasn't as bad as other hotel casinos, which is a plus for us non smokers! My husband got pretty hooked on the video craps table, and won quite a bit of money, which was a plus. 

The restaurants are overpriced, but with restaurant.com gift certificates, it's completely bearable. Our favorite restaurants on the strip are located in Mandalay Bay- House of Blues, Raffles, and theCafe. 

We rented a car, and it was super super easy to park in the garage and go right on up to the room. Nice and short walk. 

Oh- and on checkin, I swear to God, the girl that helped us at the front desk was the HAPPIEST person I have ever met. Totally made that longggg line worth it. 

One thing though- we went in March, and wasn't expecting to be able to take advantage of the beach (sad sad sad), but was looking forward to the outdoor heated hottub. It was FREEZING cold. Lukewarm bath water. Dissapointing. 

We also signed up for the spa's day pass. It was very very lovely, but with the hot tub not being coed, we were really let down. I can see having seperate sauna's and steam rooms, but it would have been nice to relax with my husband.

My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights as part of my 30th birthday Vegas trip. First I'll start with the bad: We booked our room on the Mandalay Bay official website, and we used the ""Thank you"" deal, which listed the following: 20% off room prices, FREE upgrade to a suite, and late check-out. We were waffling between Mandalay and Caesar's and a few other properties, but we chose Mandalay SPECIFICALLY because of this deal... a suite for $99 seemed great. Well, it was too good to be true... when we arrived at the desk, we mentioned the ""free upgrade to a suite"", and the desk attendant pretended to rifle through some papers before telling us, ""sorry, no suites available."" Hard to believe there were NO suites available in January, in the off-season during winter time. The hotel wasn't even crowded at all. There was no check-in line and we never saw anyone on our floor. It felt like false advertising to us.

We were given a basic King room with the ugliest view ever- it was a roof with air conditioning units on it. Terrible! To make it worse, there were stray hairs stuck to the bathroom door, and the room didn't seem clean. But, we put up with it because we had flown from the east coast all night and we were exhausted. The room was very disappointing. Luckily, we only stayed here 2 nights.

However, the reason I rated this hotel 3 stars is for their casino, pool areas, and restaurants. The hotel was also very quiet. My husband played poker here and said it was ""great."" Also, ""Moorea Beach"" was open even though it was winter, and we swam in the pool and gorgeous hot tub in the rain.. we were the only people there! The restaurants we ate at were very good, but expensive... We ended up leaving the resort to find more affordable food options. Shopping area was very small, and the location of MB is difficult to get to other hotels besides Luxor and Excaliber. Luckily, the weather was nice so we were able to walk the strip. Honestly, I wouldn't really recommend staying here unless you purchase a suite to begin with, and if it's significantly cheaper than other properties. We weren't super impressed.",0,0,0

They were going to fix it so that he would be able to stay in the same room. Seemed simple enough until they put a hold on our card for $768. When we came down to talk to them and try and correct it we were told it was an authorization hold for incidents and it would come off. We asked them to move that charge to another credit card and they said that wasn't a problem. That the original $768 would show on our account within 24 hours. Except they then charged my original credit card another $222.00 and $131.00 which was supposed to be credited not charged again. They also charged my husbands Amex $222 by accident and we are waiting for that refund as well.

I've stayed here before and they are very roomy and spacious. Perfect for my fam trip! Each room is equipped with their own bathroom, and hot tub. (sometimes only 1 room has a hot tub) I love how th curtains open up with a push of a button.

Anyway, my main reason for staying here if the pool. I brought my daughter along with me who loves to be in the water. Mandalay Bay offers and kiddy pool, wave pool, lazy river, hot tubs, and private cabana area's. I could literally stay out there all day, every day.

I really dont have anything negative to say about this place, only that I love all its amenitties. 

Oh, and if you have the chance to go up to the Foundation Room you wont regret it. Probably the best view in Vegas!",1,1,1

I would expect better service for conferrnce attendees. After staying at the Bellagio several times in the past two years, mandalay does not come close. Besides charging 5 dollars for a terribly bitter cup of 12 oz black coffee, you can expect to be nickel and dimed for everything including 7 bucks for a coconut water. 

The pool is ok except you have to pay for vip reserved seating to get an umbrella or sit at the water's edge. The Bellagio provides free umbrella seating and I wasn't roped off from the first two rows of seats. 

I stayed 5 nights. The first night my neighbors were a bunch of loud girls getting drunk.  They went out and came back at 3 am yelling body shots which could be heard through the wall. I don't want to hear people hooking up in the room next door. Client services did nothing when contacted. 

The second night the ice machine was leaking or another vending machine which left the hallway floor soaking wet which splashed up when you stepped on it...no sign for warning. Finally, they put a larger floor dryer out but the machine was still leaking. The dryer was in the hall for the remainder of my trip and smelled the floor up like wet farts.",3,3,0

but the pools made up for everything so 4 stars at the end.",0,0,0
