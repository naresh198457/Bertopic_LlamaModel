For a weekend brunch buffet that cost $27.99 without champagne (+$12 if you want champagne) I had expected so much more. The line is ridicuously long to get in and we were all starving by the time we were finally seated.  You would think I would've given this a 5 star since everything always tastes better when you're starving!  But everything I tried was just Ok, and there were only a couple of really tasty items.  My favorite was the prime rib.  My piece was perfectly pink and juicy.  They didn't have as much of a selection as I had hoped....a lot of their selections are your standard breakfast fare like eggs and bacon, waffles, toast, etc.  Lots of fillers, so I passed on all of them.  Things to note were the crepe and omelette stations which were both fantastic but those lines are always pretty long so I just tried a little of my friend's.  Dessert station was pretty good, but choices were nothing special.  We did spot some macarons which we loaded up onto our plate, but they use a type of raspberry jam as their macaron filling and it was just WAAAY too sweet.  We ended up opening up the macaron and scraping out the jam...for every single macaron.  And that was still their best dessert.  The creme brulee came in a close second, but they were always out! 

I took off a star for their meager selections and long lines, and another one for the lack of preparedness...if you're running a buffet, the first rule of thumb is to ALWAYS stay up to date with your buffet items! Never let the items run out!",0,0,1

Over the years it has just succumb to high cost of operation. The food quality and diversity had just denominated and sequentially deteroriooated. I

I was here for internet conference. I paid $35.38 for lunch and was not satisfied. The main dish is scramble eggs and one French style course and prime rib plus some assortments of seafood. 

It used to be they had 17 different French style courses and two BBQ stations. I guess the world has changed.

Oh boy...this was not the Le Village like before. It be better seved if i goto Denys next time. I guarantee i will never come back here again. I WOULD NOT RECOMMENDED THIS PLACE. 

For the food, i would priced at $14.99, instead of $30.99
I want my $16.00 refund please. Plus tax.

I guess the French style scramble eggs is still good but...i can do that watching youtube.",3,1,1

Dined here for the first time and all went well.  Came here for dinner and food was great. We love meat and there was no shortage of it here. Plenty to choose from including roast prime rib, lamb, turkey and pork brisket. As far as seafood choices we had ice cold crab legs and they were already cracked open, actually, they were sliced in half to expose the crab meat. I had the salmon and it was tasty and delicious. Also tried the sauteed mushrooms... yummy! For dessert, there were choices of tiramisu, creme brulee, creme caramel... oh, yes, I tried them all! Originally priced at $30.99\/ea with their rewards card. We used our dining voucher from our timeshare resort gifted to us. Lighting was dim and the atmosphere was themed as if dining outdoors in a village (hence, the name of this buffet restaurant). The servers were dressed as village locals. Had great dining experience here.

In Vegas most of the buffets are decent with the standard prime rib (which is probably ""choice"" and not ""prime"") and other favorites like crab and shrimp.  

This was the first time that I've been to Le Village Buffet and will probably make it a place to go when ever I'm in Vegas.

First off, the variety is top notch with a full array of a French menu.  

What really surprised me was the braised pork belly with apple and sweet potato.  It was juicy with just enough fat to really add flavor.  And by the way, exercise dieticians state that you need fat in your diet to provide energy for your work outs.  

Other things to try are the macaroni in a truffle cream sauce (probably ground truffles or truffle oil), crepes (both savory and sweet) and vegetable side dishes (which I usually avoid since you need to maximize your dollar value).

They had shrimp and crab legs, which I guess can be considered French cuisine, except it was just blanched and served cold. 

What was weird was the small section of sushi with a couple of trays of tekka maki and California role.  I guess they wanted to cater a little to the Japanese tourists.  But the ones I saw were eating everything but the sushi.

Now the important part...the desserts!  Creme brulee, flan, macaroons, crepes, frozen custard, bread pudding, fruit tarts and lots of cookies.  Yes, I tried them all.

I don't really like the macaroons, but I had to give them a try.  Still don't like them.

If you want to go to a Vegas buffet, go directly to Paris.  In my opinion its the best on the strip!",1,0,1

I find it to be extremely frustrating that they rushed me for my $31.99 buffet. I should have had an unlimited amount of time if not atleast an hour. How are you supposed to enjoy everything a buffet has to offer in 45 minutes? Ridiculous.

I quickly began getting as much food at the buffet to ensure that I could try everything there was to offer. I was extremely dismayed whenever I realized that the dinner rolls were not kept in warmers nor was their honey butter. The dinner rolls we're terrible quality I've had much better dinner rolls at Ryan's Buffet or Golden Coral Buffet which are both about $20 cheaper. 

Another item that I tried was the sirloin steak. The steaks were terrible quality, did not taste good at all and for a $30 buffet you couldn't even order a steak medium rare they were all well done. While chewing the steak I tried to gather what the taste reminded me of and I soon realized that it tasted like a hot dog. I was not pleased with the quality of steak nor was I pleased with the quality of prime rib. 

Whenever it got time for dessert I was really excited because I had been saving room to ensure that I would be able to try everything on the dessert section of the buffet. I love bread pudding and it is always one of my go-tos at buffets and the bread pudding at Le Village buffet was not good at all. I've had much better at every other buffet I've visited and I've been to a lot of buffets. 

I would say that the mashed potatoes and gratin potatoes along with macaroni and cheese along with alfredo pasta was good, yes I tried them all. They still did not make up for the price point and had me in the bathroom thirty minutes later.

As an avid buffet eater I've learned before purchasing buffet to ask the hostess if I can take a look at whats out. I normally do this whenever I visit a new buffet, but I did not do that this time, I wish I would have because it would have saved me money because i wouldnt have gotten the buffet.",14,15,9

ANYWAY, there always seemed to be a really long line for Le Village, so we avoided it in the past. However, I was recently in Vegas for a work event, and was gifted with Diamond status for the Harrah's ""family"" of hotels and casinos, so I was able to use my VIP status to bypass the line, go through the fancy area, and get seated right away. YAY!

The ambiance of the Le Village buffet gets 4 stars. They really try to make you feel like you're in a little courtyard somewhere in France, which is cool with me. Especially when I was coming down from a stressful weekend and just wanted to relax, eat, and drink. I didn't feel like I was in Vegas, which totally worked for me. Our server was really nice, and had iced teas and mimosas (YAY, mimosas!!) on the table right away, and our mimosa glasses really didn't ever get empty. I'm a big fan of free unlimited mimosas, so I was a pretty happy girl from that standpoint.

Now, the food. Honestly, from the ever-present line and a lot of the reviews, I was expecting to be wowed. And I really wasn't. I mean, the food was good, and this buffet is definitely better than some, but there wasn't anything terribly French. Or many things that I couldn't get at any other buffet, really. But there were some pretty good dishes that I did break my one plate rule for and went back for seconds: bacon and brie pasta, spicy mussels, garlic mushrooms, roasted tomatoes, lamb tips, shrimp (oh, shrimp. How I love you.), and the antipasti plate. The creme brulee for dessert was nice, but nothing to swoon over. The rest of the desserts didn't do it for me, which was probably good, after the second plate of the things I mentioned above!

The price was comparable to other Vegas buffets, and for the quality of the food, a better deal than at some of the other hotels. All in all, was it good? Yep. Was it my favorite Las Vegas buffet? Nope. Would I be back again? Yes, but I wouldn't wait for ages in a line. It's a solid option, though, and like I said...the ambiance is worth it, especially if you want to feel like you're not in Vegas for awhile.",3,0,2

I have tried the weekend breakfast buffet twice in the past two months and both times found the omelettes to be perfectly made, the breads fresh and delicious, and all the other dishes I tried were 1)original and 2)tasty!

There were many food options, all at different stations or ""regions"" of cooking so I think all preferences can be satisfied here.  I don't know that I would spend the money to take my kids again because it was a little pricier than other buffets, but a definite return for the hubby and me!",0,0,0

I made reservations and alas I was running a few minutes late.  The host was very welcoming and sited my guest and I.  Our waiter was Jason and he was fab.  I went as part of the Buffet thing and this was our last meal.  I wish that we had made it our first.  The waiter was very attentive in getting our drinks.  I asked for two drinks a lemonade and Mountain Dew - done.  Now onto the food.  I was stuffed by the time that I walked out of there.  There was so much food - but soo little space in my belly.  The tri trips, suasiages, chicken, etc.  The prime rib was great.  I evern saw them put on whole legs on the fire and start to cook.  Now the seafood - crab sticks, mussels, etc was great.  I had the Salmon and it was done great.  I wanted to eat more but I was stuffed.  The crepes with the whipped cream.  The cook had to use a spoon to get it out of the bowl.  The crepes were done to perfection and crepe was not precooked like at Planet Hollywood.  It was like I had gone to heaven.  I ended up with two crepes and that was enough.  Now the Creme Burle,,,it was great.     People may complain that the buffet has gone down over the years.  For me it was great.  It was well worth going.  

They have food from different parts of france and the scenery made it even better.  Sometimes it is the small things that matter - a waiter to bring you your drinks, good food, and then the deserts...no more needs to be said.  Just go.  Again, jason was wonderful and I hope that he gets a raise soon.",1,0,0

The line was monstrous!  The line was much shorter when the Jersey Boys show let out.  However, there was a server monopolizing one of the cashier's time (trying to cash out his tips or something?) and the free cashier was a trainee who didn't know how to ring things up.  Things eventually got sorted out.

The interior is absolutely gorgeous.  The faux French village vibe (think Disney's Beauty and the Beast) was really fun to see.

I mostly indulged in crab legs the entire time.  The crab was sweet, salty, pre-cracked, and perfectly cooked.  The creme brûlée and creme caramel flan were excellent.  The bread pudding was underwhelming, as was the beef (prime rib I think, cannot remember what it was exactly).  The andouille sausage was not a winner for me, as it was super spicy.  The potatoes au gratin (scalloped potatoes) were undercooked, perhaps from being sliced too thick.  The mashed potatoes were great though.  The salmon was also quite tasty.

Beverage service was lacking, and my water glass went dry several times.",1,0,0

I used to like this place because they had some pretty high-quality and tasty dishes but during this last visit, everything seemed to have gone downhill.  Maybe it's due to the economy but you can definitely tell that quality has been sacrificed.  The meat you get from the carving table was dry and tough.  Presentation of dishes were a mess since food was strewn all over the place and nobody seemed to care about cleaning the little messes.  Oh and the crab.... Such horror...

Our server, Erika, claims that she was new with only a couple of months on the job. Boy, does she still need a lot of training!  The service was bad enough when the bus boy, Federico, came out to clear our table while we were still eating and was flat out rude.  He even tried to kick us out of the restaurant because, according to him, they had to go home.  When I asked him why he was telling us to leave when he wasn't saying anything to the people at the other tables around us, he just made a nasty remark, left, and called our server.  I made sure I got his name so I could report him to management. 

What makes it sad is this is one of our favorite buffets in the Caesars Entertainment family of hotel\/casinos in Las Vegas. Being a Total Rewards Diamond member, we do not have to wait in the long lines. We always try to have at least one dinner here whenever we're here in Vegas. We like the variety of foods they offer especially the crepes and the steamed crab legs.  We've always had great service here before that's why we were surprised to have such a horrible experience tonight.  The wait staff had always been great and very attentive. They even anticipated our needs a lot of times. That's why we love coming back.

The only excitement we got in line was when a Brave lady decided to charge her phone at a outlet and she just left it there. We played the ""who's goin to steal that iPhone game"". She returned 20 minutes later and grabbed her phone. Seriously that 
Was the highlight of the wait.

Decoration: very classy and French like. Everything starts with ""Le"" something something something... Too hard to pronounce. Lots of old fashion stuff, antiques, paintings, and even the workers. For all the youngsters, if you want a hyped up buffet, just go to wicked spoon or Wynn because this is more like a family buffet.

Service: out waitress was very nice. She gave us so many drink options but never the champaign menu. She made us feel so young because we are legal to drink but she thought we were all 15 or 16. Why thank you :)

Food: sucks overall 
[pros]: 
1. Delicious fruits: fresh and sweet
2.yummy scrambled eggs with sausages was not too salty and was fluffed just right 
3.chocolate and vanilla custard ice cream was so refreshing
4.creme brûlée was good and very light
5. nice cold water
6. French onion soups was salty but not ad bad as Outbacks. Not cheese though

[cons]:
1.  only three fruits were offered which were  Pineapples, honeydew, and cantaloupe
2. Stations were not organized... I didn't know where to start because all the stations have random foods. For instance, the salad bar and fruits were in the middle of the room. Cool. Where's the sushi? Oh it's with the breakfast station. Err okay? Let's go to the breakfast station. Whaat?? They're everywhere! Station 1: egg Benedict with roast beef and prime ribs, station 2: stir fried veggies, mashed potatoes, bread, station 3: scrambled eggs, waffles, sushi, sausages, station 4: fried chicken, crab legs, soup. And there's a section full of desserts.
3. Egg Benedict: I only ate the egg cuz the muffin was hard as rock and the ham was hard and dry
4. Sausage smells gross
5. Sushi rice is super hard 
6. Smoked salmon is super salty
7. Cookies was rock hard... I can kill someone with then
8. For a French restaurant, where the hell is my macarons?!
9. Restroom: only one stall. 
10. Pretty everything was dry and gross

I went for the prime rib and got a paper thin slice that was falling apart. The short bald man carving for me must have been furious for his shortcomings since every trip i took to get more he would give me less and less. The crepe station wasnt any better. The woman working until 1pm was obviously more intent on talking to her coworkers. She asked the person in front of me what they wanted three times. No joke. Once before she poured the batter, once more when she flipped the crepe and again before she filled it. I asked for a mushroom truffle crepe. She said huh?? Whats that. I repeated myself... And enunciated. When she still had no clue what i was talking about i told her the number. She was obviously rushing despite the lack of a line behind me. The crepe was raw and doughy so i only ate the mushrooms. I went back for a dessert crepe. When it came time for me to order she asked what i wanted and proceeded to start a conversation with a coworker who was standing there doing nothing. She asks me, ""What would you like sweetheart?"" A banana nutella crepe please. She continues her conversation with her coworker not seeming to have heard what i said. I literally told her 5 times. Banana nutella. She ends her conversation her coworker and asks again what id like. Having a mother who is hard of hearing i remained congenial and repeated myself and smiled. She starts throwing the crepe together and yells at a server ""que hora es?!"" and says, ""cinco minutos! Me voy a casa!"". She hands me a crepe still glistening with raw batter completely plain. Flabbergasted i just walked away and placed the crepe on a stack of dirty dishes and waited 5 minutes so she would go home and the next shift would start. The next employee was much more patient and actually made sure my crepe was cooked, topped it with powdered sugar, whipped cream and nutella all of which were absent previously. The manager of the buffet seemed to be doing nothing besides walk slowly and stand on the side lines doing nothing. Previously the employees would clear breakfast items away directly after the service ended. This was not the case this time; hashed browns and quiche sat on the line. We left around 2.

The ambiance of the buffet worked very well with the theme of the hotel.  Though it was bright and sunny outside, the interior had the perfect mood lighting.  The service was great with at tentative waitresses.  All in all it was a great dining experience at a very reasonable price.",1,0,0

There were 4 of us and we had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated. We had all eaten here before and it had been very good.  Not so much now. As we walked around looking for our favorite cheeses, we discovered that they had really cheapened up the cheese tray.  There was no brie, no soft bleu or otherfwise, just some slices of what appeared to be cheddar or havarti.

Many of the areas were empty and they were not quick to refill. I was excited to finally get a crab leg, but when I cracked it, the smell was so fishy that I chose not to eat it.  

The Prime Rib was very good and there was a good assortment of vegetables and fruit.

My husband had a made to order omelette, however, they didn't have any sour cream. The breads were good, not nearly the beautiful dessert buffet with French pastries that they had had in the past.

The service of the front line staff (hostess, wait staff) was good,   

Oveall, I was disappointed as I really felt that the quality had gone down hill. I remember when this was the best buffet in all of Vegas, not so much any more.",2,1,1

It was really disappointing and my dad kept complaining about the lack of variety of food options too.

There was a huge line but we opted to pay $10 more for the 'express' line which was not worth it. We definitely would've crossed the street for some Bellagio buffet goodness instead and give them the extra $10 bucks.

The service was crappy too, I felt bad for the servers who were mostly older ladies. I saw one of them limping while she walked and it was worse because she had to carry heavy-ass plates and cups back and forth. She even came by to tell us that she was exhausted from working since 6 am that morning (it was 3 pm at the time). And because of that, I shall forgive her for pouring my requested apple juice into the cup that used to hold my dad's orange juice. No wonder it tasted funky.

My favorite part was definitely the creme brulee and crepes as others have mentioned. My dad really liked the cocktail shrimp, he said he's never seen such a clean shrimp before.

I had a good experience and the server was attentive.

We liked this buffet so much from our BoB we decided to try it out one more time before we leave, this time it was lunch time.  There were a lot of different pastas and meats.  I think lunch is a couple bucks more but I think the breakfast buffet is better.

There was a crepe station where one had a crepe made on the spot with the toppings available - the line was always long.

They didn't have a huge selection of food, I'm not sure if it's because it was breakfast and there's not much you can really serve. They had the basic American breakfast; pancakes, eggs, sausage, omelets etc. And they had a section for a bit of French breakfast--sorry I forgot what they were. I just ate several plates of salad (lol) and typcial pancake with sauages and bacon! It was good, nothing special.... But their OJ...that was bomb! Tasted like it was freshly squeezed!

While, the food here was nothing special, it was a beautiful location. The cobblestone, and the tables, it had a great setup. One of the nicest of the buffets I've been to in Las Vegas (and I've been going almost every year since I was 3 years old). That explains the third star.

The fourth star is because of the kindness and customer service we received. My mother is somewhat of a kleptomaniac, except she asks before she takes. She was enamored with the coffee cups that the buffet had. They were very cute. She asked the waitress if she could buy them or take them, etc, and the waitress said, ""One moment , let me check"". Usually, when my mom does this, we are given rude responses. When the waitress returned, she gave my mother a set of 6 coffee cups for free. We left her a great tip, and my mom was very happy.

After a rather disaapointing Buffet at Rio the night before we where almost ready to give up on the whole buffet scene at Vegas. It seems people in this city prefer quantity over quality. NOT my thing.

BUT Then came La Village Buffet...the answer to Vegas mediocrity had been infront of my eyes all along in my very own hotel! (The hotel I was staying in I dont own Paris Paris...I wish!) 

What got us to give another buffet a go once again?? Two things!!

1. We were famished..
2...$5 all you can drink Mimosas...... need I say more??? ;) No...I need not.

It was a breakfast paradise and I am the kind of person who typically just has coffee and a pastry for breakfast... but this was enough to turn breakfast into my favorite meal for a day! A Crepe station, build your own bagles and lox, all sorts of eggs and fresh fruit lovely potatoes and hash......turkey and chicken sausage and bacon.....It was all great quality food as well and choice cut meats

The desserts were nothing to write home about so don't go for that.  So unimpressive I cannot even remember any of them and I checked them out twice! 

The crab legs at dinner were some of the best at a buffet ever!  They were ice cold and not sitting in hot water like I have had so many times, so they were very flavorful and not watered down.

One of my favorite dishes was the creamy pasta with truffle oil!  Yummy flavor!

The service both times was very good.  There was a line but I don't know how long the wait was because I got to skip the lines ;-)

在週一至週四的晚餐時段，這裡的自助餐提供包括蟹腳與牛排在內的內容也只要屬於中價位的美金三十元，以查理個人的經驗來說是一個不錯的用餐選擇。雖然這間自助餐的熱度屬於中間等級，但在這裡還是要提醒大家善用可以網路訂位的功能，直接享受跟其它VIP貴賓一樣不需要花費時間來排隊等位，絕對是一般民眾在造訪賭城自助餐時的省時省力的大利多。

結帳完後進入用餐區，就像是來到了法國某個小鎮上，既樸實又可愛、兼具歷史感與舒適的用餐空間，絕對是會讓初次來到這裡用餐的朋友感到新奇的一大特色。從庭院中的街燈到懸掛在「房屋」上的招牌，就算是造訪過許多以華麗大氣著稱的自助餐，這樣的溫馨風格還是蠻讓人喜愛的。

餐點安排的位置也就像是分配在法國田間的小村莊的各式建築物中，走著走著還真的有種像是逛街的感覺。這是一個距離入口最遠的一個餐臺與座位區，走到底就是洗手間的位置，還挺方便的。從樸實的民房到熱鬧的街頭，無論是圍坐在火爐旁與三五好友閒話家常，或是多人沿著長桌團聚用餐，不同主題的用餐區域規劃也能滿足各種人數的聚餐。

這是一個類似設置在山麓風景區之中的旅館大廳般的用餐區，搭配燈飾、花紋壁紙與地磚等元素的安排，華麗又不失典雅風格。相對於較為寬敞、有著各式各樣風格的座位區，其它的餐臺和料理區就相對的迷你了些，排隊的動線有些混亂。點用熱茶和熱咖啡，送上的是整壺的熱水和熱咖啡，這點還挺方便的。

這裡只有提供雪蟹蟹腳，而且是陳放在比較邊緣的餐臺一個不明顯的角落，或許並不是作為主打的食材，但在品嚐後卻有讓人意料之外的美味。與蟹腳一起陳列在同個區域的還包括沙拉與壽司等，但相對貧乏的內容是建議可以忽略的品項。一邊走走逛逛計畫著等等要拿取的餐點內容時，也可以欣賞一下四周懸掛在牆壁上的畫作印刷品，在享用大餐的同時也補足一些人文氣息。

在照片右下方加入香料卷在一起的烤羊肉算是其它地方吃不到的特色料理，可惜有些部份的肉質比較乾，烤牛肋排則是有著超水準的表現，尤其是左下角那接近外層與帶有筋膜部份的肉質，不但是咀嚼起來口感豐富、外層的香料更是帶來讓味蕾振奮的鹹香風味。雖然吃完第二次再去拿時牛肋排就已經被完整地「消滅」，廚師說要等下一輪烤好的時間更是超出預期，下回造訪時要記得先多拿幾塊牛肋排。

肉類食材的表現讓人有眼睛一亮的感覺，其它的食材無論是蔬菜或是海鮮也是值得一試。原本沒有讓人期望太高的蟹腳，品嚐起來卻有著水準之上的甜度，肉質也很飽滿不會吃起來水水的那般軟爛，吃完一盤又接著一盤。

雖然這裡的熟食種類並不像是其它間自助餐那般囊括多國風味的料理，但在口味的精緻程度上也因此維繫著比較穩定的水準。帶殼的蝦子是表現較為普通的，雖然鮮度與肉質彈性還可以，但是個頭真的過於嬌小。

享受自助餐有一個很重要的關鍵那就是在大快朵頤自己喜愛的食材時，也要盡量地去感受來自食材多樣性帶來的享受，每種都拿一點來試試也稍稍達到營養均衡的目的。

以中價位的自助餐來說，這裡的海鮮類食材品質可以說是水準之上，吃到的口味都不錯。來到這裡當然還少不了也是帶有濃郁法式風格，廣受顧客喜愛的法式美食可麗餅，無論是採用新鮮水果或是肉類青菜，從甜至鹹多眾風味滿足顧客的需求。

各式口味可麗餅在顧客眼前由經驗豐富的廚師新鮮現做是最大的號招，而口味本身也不含糊，恰到好處的餅皮厚度與微微的焦香，透過眼前製作過程更顯得美味誘人。軟嫩的外皮裡頭包著滿滿的餡料，加上外層青醬與黑醋的提味，風味可說是與許多專門吃可麗餅的餐廳不相上下。

將各式熟食、主餐吃得差不多後，當然要來品嚐一下在法國料理中也是相當出名的甜食風味，而在這裡的甜食區是獨立設立在座位區的正中央的位置，就像是一棟顯目的糖果及烘培屋一般吸引人的目光。

麻雀雖小、五臟俱全，應該是很適合用來形容這裡的甜食區，五顏六色的馬卡龍也是具有代表性的法式甜點。現點現做的可麗餅，不論是鹹味或是甜味，當作主餐或是餐後甜點都相當合適，扎扎實實的用料，最好是多人來分食一份，不然再加上其他澱粉類的餐點，沒吃幾口就會覺得有飽足感了。

在現做的可麗餅外甜品的精緻程度對照一些要價更高的自助餐來說是有段差距，但實際上的口味都不錯，甜度的拿捏也恰到好處，不會吃來特別膩口。在所剩不多的肚皮空間中，看是留給招牌的可麗餅，還是喝些香味濃郁的洋蔥湯（雖然有點鹹），在法式的風情中帶給肚皮滿足的享受。

有時也會聽到身邊的朋友們對於賭城自助餐的負面評價，但說實在的以美國普遍偏高的消費水準來說，更何況是賭城這個全世界知名的觀光娛樂城市，以美金三十元的花費來說，豐富多元的餐點內容仍是帶來物有所值的用餐體驗。

在原本用餐的花費之外，也可以再加上美金十多元的價格來將酒精性的飲料喝到飽，這價格比去很多酒吧點上一杯酒還便宜，想像一下自己是身處在法國鄉下的小村莊，下午時間就開始來買醉的自在暢快。兼顧美味與實惠、更有著一般自助餐餐廳沒有的便利性、再加上主題鮮明的有趣用餐環境，推薦給有預算考量也想感受賭城自助餐體驗的朋友們。",2,0,1

We came back to try it after a horrid experience at Spice Market and an average experience at Bacchanal. It now seems most of Caesar's properties are suffering from the same poor leadership. I think that if Mr. Frissora made a surprise visit, some folks would be called into the principal's office.

We got there around 3:20 or so. There was no line, so the young lady asked us to come to her register. As soon as we did, another lady said we needed to go back to the other register and wait for the third one to come back from somewhere. After a few minutes, I saw this third one come from across the way. Is it normal for folks\/cashiers to leave the front unattended? Weird.

We were seated by a nice pillar that obstructed views from 2 of the seats. When I asked, the hostess said we cold move to the opposite table, but I had to point out it was the same situation but with the pillar on the other side of the table. There was also a semi full bus-cart right next to the table welcoming us to enjoy ourselves. **these come into play later

The food was not up to any standard. Dry, inconsistent and boring are words we used for hours afterward to describe it. Half of the lines were void of food and what was there was obviously just new piled on old (we got to see staff doing this - new fish just tossed on top of old fish, new potatoes scraped into the old bin, even the cold cuts were mixed up...one batch of ham was cut in half and the other batch of ham was whole). Many of the items that were there were so far overcooked, after one bite, you set them aside. The duck (which was labeled as pork-although I know pork has no wings) was so dry, it had an odd taste to it. The mac and cheese had brown bits in it that we are still not sure what they were. Even the crab legs were still frozen...not cold...frozen. Anything with cream in it had an unusual sweetness to it. The only thing we completely ate was the prime rib and au gratin potatoes. These were great - everything else wasn't even diner food.

There were minimal desserts. Of the four sides to the dessert area, 2 of them were completely void and at least one of the remaining sides was 75% empty. The salad area, if you want to call it that, was an interesting place. The staffer working it had her plastic wrap - the nice big roll - right there on the countertop next to storage bins and in use bain marie's (soup pots). She also had her sleeves of souffle cups laying there, next to the bags of salad. This almost seemed to be a theme there. Lets put all our prep and cooking gear around on the surfaces...our guests won't mind.

They really want you to experience eating leftovers in a Parisian alleyway, so the floor is nice and nasty-littered with food scraps, paper and who knows what and they push these carts through at intervals almost like they are trying to recreate trams. Why would anyone decide pushing carts across an uneven floor is the way to bus tables\/haul ice\/haul dinner ware? Actually, one staffer made it extra special by parking his bus cart next to us again and then wondering off for a while. 

Needless to say, this buffet has been removed of our list to EVER visit...and it is looking a lot like it is becoming an issue Caesar's wide. We have thought we would try Flavors (Harrah's) and see if this lack of training and management extends to all of Caesar's Entertainment F&B.

It was about $70 for two of us to have a champagne brunch, they serve bottomless Mamosa's and the options for food were absolutely overwhelming; which is a problem I love to have!

Just wander around trying to stack my plate as high as possible I did notice they have an entire dessert station that is absolutely darling!

There was a seafood station, a crêpe station, meat station, breakfast station with the traditional biscuits, gravy, pancakes, fruit and everything was just delicious. I did notice that there was even a sushi station but I didn't get to try any of that. I know some of the hotels offer an unlimited buffet option where you get unlimited access to five local buffets for 24 hours for only $50, at the beginning I felt that was outrageous until I paid $70 for two of us to have our buffet brunch and then I realized I made a horrible mistake and not purchasing that.

I'll cut to the chase. The best part are the made to order crepes... and the warm chocolate sauce that you can put on them.. Yummy.

The crepe station usually doesn't have the chocolate sauce there, but if you trek over to the banna's foster station, it should be there.  They also have whipped creme, and powdered sugar.   I think they have this going ALL day.

The meats are ok, sometimes they'll have some good seasoned meat in the corner, sometimes it isn't there.  The rest of the stuff is honestly pretty standard stuff..  

The crepes alone are worth the cost of this buffet if you like sweets. I can eat 2, maybe 3 fully loaded ones.  With a little meat, plus free beverage, it's worth it.  


If you can arrive before the cut off time for lunch, or dinner, and get to the register to pay, you can stay later and get the better food for cheaper.. 

The line can get VERY long at times..  They don't have rack of lamb, and the carving station has been mediocre lately. (For dinner)",1,0,1

The lineup moves relatively quickly (plenty of seating), which is always a good thing.

The inside reminded me of Beauty and the Beast (Disney), as it really does look like a somewhat cartoony French village.  They did a really good job on this one.

The food is of decent quality.  Plenty of seafood (snow crab but no Alaska king crab).  I really liked the pasta, especially the macaroni and cheese (go figure).  The cheese section is a good way to try the various types out there if you've never had too much exposure in the past.

One head-scratcher is that there's a sushi section.  Don't get me wrong, it's of decent quality even by Vancouver standards.  I just wonder if Napoleon packed that in his lunch when heading off to battle.

The desserts are top notch.  Hello chocolate, sugar, and diabetes.

Service is good overall.

Anyway.  Look.  I judge this buffet on French food.  Because it is a ""French"" theme buffet.  Some people would say, Carlos Jr what about the snow crab legs on ice and the sushi (which by the way sucks at all Harrahs buffets).  I would then say.  I could eat crablegs at any of the Harrahs dinner buffets and even the Lago for lunch.  Why go to a French theme buffet for Crablegs.
Folks the Crablegs were the only thing good here.  I tried to figure out if French food should even be in a buffet.  I have had it before at some other buffets around the country.  But this buffet lacks inspiration or passion.  The workers don't seem to care one damn bit.  I can see it on their faces with the exception of the omletette chef.  But come on, seriously an omletette with oil and no real butter in a French Res.  I think not.  How much is real butter when you are serving smoked salmon?
This place need Ramsey or someone to come and kick it in the ass and get it going.  I would go one by one item by item on why they sucked so bad, but they all just tasted blah blah blah...  Boring.  Such a shame for such a neat looking buffet in a neat casino.  Carlos Sr. pretty much hates this buffet now.

I went with high expectations since virtually everyone that has been to Vegas had raved about this particular buffet (apparently, buffets are ""the thing to do"" in Vegas) and assured me that I'd have heck of a time indulging in gastronomical glee.  I had been starving all day and, therefore, had good prospects of visiting it for dinner.

WELL.... For $25 for dinner, sure - it wasn't a bad deal.  But the food variety\/quality weren't exactly up to par.  Perhaps I had too high of expectations.  But I really wasn't WOW'd.  Perhaps I'm just in a reallly negative mood (after having written a one-star review of Delta airlines) and such negativity is spilling onto this review.  Nonetheless, I certainly wasn't wow'd by Le Village buffet.  In addition to the disappointing food, our serving lady kept forgetting to get us our beverages and utensils.  But she sure did come by enough times to ask, ""You OK??""  Kinda strange.  Kinda.

Fresh crepes:  Sure, they're fresh all right.  But since when are crepes as thick and puffy as hamburger buns??  The texture was off as well.  The only thing I liked about their crepes was the unlimited availability of fresh blueberries.  Oh yeah, how could I forget -- no chocolate ingredients at a creperie??  Now THAT's outrageous!

What I did like was the availability of fresh king crabs and mussels.  Also enjoyable was the decor (but no music??!?!??).

Hesitant but hungry, I went.

I was pleased.
Your usual eggs, sausages, bacon, toast..but add crepes, a large fruit section...A CHEESE SECTION (they had me there), oatmeal, cream of wheat.....and the pastry section was divine.  Bite size croissants, danishes, cookies, creme brulees, muffins.  Adorable.

This buffet will have you screaming for more. I love the seating, it's very Disney-like, specifically Pirates of the Caribbean the restaurant. Wonderful service, they're very friendly, hard working and attentive. 

I recommend seating in one of the little rooms, just ask your host if you can sit in one, they'll usually seat you unless it's completely full. 

For breakfast: arrive early, I'm talking about 9-9:30am on a weekday, probably 8:30am on a weekend or a holiday. We arrived at 9:50 and got seated by 10:20 and the line just kept building up. The crepes are ok. They get ya by having them made in front of you but that's where it ends. The sausage selection on the other hand is game. They have at least 10 different sausages to choose from. Also you have to try the potatoes and corned beef. Their breakfast is really really good. 

For dinner: arrive early, we came by at 6pm on a weekday and there was practically no line. The struggle was real. We were trying so hard not to over eat because everything was so good. I loved the seafood, pretty basic, and all the desserts. Also had an arnold palmer which was a really nice touch to our meal. 

Overall a fantastic buffet. We had the 24 hour pass which was around $60 after tax... it basically gives you access to a few buffets and lets you use it up to five times in a 24 hour period.

Now I didn't eat every single dish... But the salmon wasn't over cooked, the beef was tender and seasoned well, the chicken was tasty. The desserts were a lot of French fun.Wine comes with your meal, that's nice...
#3 Funny... We made reservations and sat down immediately, nice. There was a line disney style curved in a little dark awful ""lobby"" area. Went on forever. There were at least 8-10 tables empty around us throughout our meal. Why? Generating hype with the line? It ain't a club!

When I go on a trip, first and foremost, I need to know that my tummy is going to be taken care of. I don't give a hoot about scenery, I just want to eat. Maybe it's the Filipino in me, but I need breakfast, snack, lunck, snack, dinner and then after maybe something to tide me over till bedtime. Buffet of Buffets takes care of that and this is our first stop. 

We line up around 10am and it takes about 20 mins to get to the cashier. It's like Disneyland: you wait in line and just when you think you're inside, there's another snake-y line. So we pay and since I have a Total Rewards Card, a) it's cheaper by like $5 and b) I don't get to wear a bracelet all the live long day... you see this, you think it's for a club... no, it's for a buffet... ahahaaa...

Our server is such a nice guy. So happy, so full of life... totally happy to help us get enough coffee, juice, pop (for me) and water... it must have been because he was off soon because another woman who looked really unhappy became our server. Still brought us our stuff, but I felt bad asking her.

I started out with bacon and sausage... I picked up some macaron-y looking things and some yogurt with mangoes. Obviously, the meat was good. Who can screw up bacon? The macaron-y things were wonderful. I got two to start in case they were weird, but they were really crispy chewy with lemon curd in the middle. The mangoes were under ripe. My only complaint. Why can't I find good mango anywhere? Before breakfast was over, I ran and made sure I got a biscuit with country gravy. You wanna do this right? Get a bowl from the yogurt area to allow for maximum gravy on your biscuit without getting it all over your macarons.

Then, the change over! Like a mad dash, all the people in the restaurant clamor to get in line. I have a slice of prime rib. Wow. The meat is cooked to my liking- rare and it's so tender. To go with that, I get some of the truffle mac and cheese. I wish I had gotten more. It's so creamy and the flavour is dare I say, AMAZING! So good. I've googled how to make it, but I don't even want to attempt in case I sully the good memory of this mac and cheese. Of course, I grab more desserts, but this time it's two creme brulees. The sugar was crackly... sometimes at buffets, the tops can be sub-par, but not here.

To be honest, the price of food in Vegas is so cheap that it doesn't really make sense to go to many buffets. You're just indulging yourself with more sin. And this is coming from someone who is an atheist. It's just not all that healthy and I haven't had a post-buffet experience where I said to myself  ""You know, I don't regret eating all that."" 

No, it's usually ""Why the fuck did I eat all that god damn food?"" and followed by me being of no use to anyone for a couple of hours as I recover from a food coma as well as just not wanting to do much activities.. and given that this is Vegas, that's a tragic tragic thing. 

This buffet has a quaint look and feel to it. Of course being in Paris it has a certain Beauty and the beast feel to it. In fact I was wondering when Gaston to show up and brag about how much he won in the nickle slots. 

The buffet is sectioned off. Was stuck in some little fake make shift house. Way to kill my line of sight to the fake blue sky painted above, Buffet wait staff! As for the food selection - There was some decent stations. The carving station seems to be my favorite. There's something magical and fresh feeling with getting meat sliced off a whole shank.

The fruit selection was pretty dismal. The dessert selection, while good, I was a little underwhelmed. You're themed after a french continental location, I'm sure Remy the rat could make better dessert options. Maybe he was too busy making some of that thrown together sushi.  

The fish station has shrimp and crab legs. Some staples I was proud of. Over all, it's a good spot for a meal, but my adverse feelings towards buffets as a whole just doesn't allow me to rank it more than an A-Okay.",5,4,4

The breakfast food was all pretty normal, but executed relatively well compared to the lunch dishes.  I ate a lot of eggs and smoked salmon.  Most of the best dishes were the simply prepared ones.  The beef roast (unsure of the cut) was delicious, as were the grilled vegetables and mozzarella\/tomato\/basil salad.  

The more complex dishes I found to be inedible.  Mushroom risotto - the risotto was hard and clumpy (I make a better risotto than that!) and lacked a strong mushroom flavor.  The seafood stew was THE WORST.  The mussels WERE NOT DE-BEARDED!!  (FYI, the 'beard' of mussels are tough and fibrous and have a scratchy feel that makes me want to spit it out) I have never prepared or been served mussels that were not de-bearded.  The chicken alfredo pasta and basil pesto was the best of the pastas - the alfredo sauce was very garlicky, which I loved.  The roasted duck had a sweet fruity taste, which was unexpected.  And the coq au vin was made with chicken, and was decently flavorful, but I've definitely had better.

The queue before entering is inexcuable.  Even if there are many tables available, they make parties wait at least fifteen minutes regardless.  The excuse was that there were no wait staff available.  However you can see the wait staff chatting with each other so it wasn't as if they were busy helping customers or prepping tables.  There was even one waitress who just stood around and watched and did little to supervise or coordinate.  

Wait staff is extremely unattentive.  Was there almost two hours but only got drinks refilled twice.  Again, too busy conversing with each other to help patrons.  Really poorly managed and unacceptable customer service.  

Food quality and variety also has taken a turn for the worse.  Entrees and desserts used to have a French or European flair.  The food now is average buffet fare that can be had anywhere else and at better quality.   

This buffet is still better than other buffets around the country but in Las Vegas, a buffet needs to be on top of their game to compete and Le Village is no longer a destination buffet.

This was the first of three buffets we went to while in Vegas (others were Wynn and Wicked Spoon at Cosmopolitan, both better than Le Village).  We were there at lunchtime.  There is a wide variety of food, but not as much selection as some other buffets.  However, the price was about $10 cheaper than the other buffets per person, so that makes a difference.  The whole place is rather dark, which is unfortunate, because Paris is such a beautiful hotel with all its likeness to the buildings and cafes of the city.  
The waitstaff is friendly, but not as refined as that in other buffets.  It kind of seems like typical diner waitresses instead of a fancy place.  The lady making crepes had no teeth and was probably 80 years old, and I wondered if she was an authentic Parisian crepe professional.
This was the only buffet we went to that had crab legs, and I love king crab legs.  They were delicious.  So if you're into king crab but don't want to pay $100 for buffet, then come to Le Village.  I had about 20 of them, which didn't leave much room for other stuff, but I did manage more: shrimp cocktail (shell still on), a nutella crepe (freshly made for you), chocolate lollipops, among other things.  My husband had the prime rib at all three buffets and preferred the one here at Le Village, saying it was tastiest.  So if you're into meat, that's another plus.  Also the sausage and andouille were excellent.  So were the cheeses.

It took half an hour for about 25 people to be processed and seated.  There are two problems with solutions right there.  

One: Suggest to customers buying the 24 hour dining pass (great deal, by the way) that for an upcharge they can bypass the line so as to avoid the lengthier processing line since all they have to do is get scanned.  You make money, we don't get stressed before a meal.  This is a ""french"" restaurant, right?  The stress should be in the back of the house.

Two: Maybe have, oh, I don't know, a HOSTESS to seat and a SERVER to fill drinks?  Or have a soda\/juice\/coffee station for customers to get themselves beverages?  If you trust people to carry their own plates, why not trust them to carry their own cups?  Having a willy-nilly seating arrangement with three or four ladies to seat guests and immediately get them their drinks makes absolutely no sense at all.  

One more thing in terms of running this shin-dig, and this is not a problem with just Le Village Buffet alone.  WHY.  WHY is breakfast served until 11?  WHY?  This is Vegas, right?  Famous for late nights and breakfast buffets.  So, tell me why you encourage guests to stay up late gambling and then do not reward them for their hard work by allowing them to sleep and get up for a lovely brunch?  Obviously, you should not stop serving breakfast, but perhaps should begin to add lunch items around noon and phase out things like omelets and bacon around that time too.  11 is unacceptable.  What is this, prison?

And another thing!  What is going ON back there?  With a French theme, I would expect some technically superior food.  Come on, chief!  What are y'all DOing back there?  Southern style corned beef hash, biscuits with gravy, stale bread (bread, of all things!) limp, overcooked pasta, uninspired eggs benedict wherein someone lost control of their hot sauce holding hand, and finally, crepes that were far, FAR too thick.  Wait, also the desserts were badly executed.  Creme brulees were torched like nine hours ago and did not crunch but the custard was good. No finesse, no sense of intention or dedication or grace or communication.  I tasted confusion and lack of organization.  The complete opposite of what I expect from a true french cook.  The best thing there besides the salad bar was the quiche, and I suspect it came frozen out of a package.  Get. It. Together. Chief.  Seriously.

I particularly liked the coq au vin, and the duck confit was awesome! I enjoyed the grilled chicken and thought it went really well with the grilled pepper, summer squash, and zucchini.

There were some thin crispy, dare I say, flat breads that had a great umami taste that I had multiple helpings of.

There were the snow crab legs and crab claws that every other person seemed to be raving about but I didn't try any of them. I, however, partook in wolfing down copious amounts of the shrimp cocktail. 

The dessert spread was ok though it, I felt, didn't befit a ""french spread."" That still didn't stop me from enjoying the delicious bread pudding with whipped cream.

This buffet is also part of the so called ""seven-buffet"" deal where you get a 24 hour pass to pig out on any or all of the (seven) buffet spreads across on the Vegas strip.

The price is reasonable for what you get compared to what Wynn and Bellagio is charging for their buffets.

This is what they had during the Sunday Brunch:

-Snow Crabs- Soo fresh and sweet. make sure you get some butter
-Dungenes Crab- Not as fresh as I would like them to be. I would pass on this one.
-Made to order omelettes- I'm not usually an omelets person but I loved them here.
-Ham and cheese croissants.- This one was sooo good. The croissant used in the ham and cheese croissant was much better than the plain ones they had sitting at the dessert bar.
-Peel to ear shrimp- I remember them to be bigger. Still great though.
-Prime Rib- It was ok. I expected to be a lot better. I wasn't there for the prime rib anyways.
-French Onion Soup.
-Fresh grilled veggies
-Made to order crepes. I'm still salivating thinking about them.
-Bouillabaisse very goood.
There was a bunch of other stuff but that's what I ate.

Oh and dessert...
-Creme brulee *Yum*
-Flan (perfect consistency, doesn't have that yolk smell*
-fruit tarts, cakes oh my..

I left but I had an intention to go back for my second round of plate.

For some reason, these chefs knew exactly what my favorites are, as if they were cooking for me!!!  LOL! Bacon - nice and crispy, exactly the way I like em, hashbrowns and red potatoes with herbs and stuff - I just have to get them both.  Eggs, scrambled all fluffy!  I could list more, but EVERYTHING was delicious. I mean EVERYTHING, even the COFFEE was brewed perfect! Not too strong or too weak (for me, sometimes the coffee can make or break the breakfast place).. 

What put me over the top was the made to order crepes!  I ordered a crepe with banana and nutella with drizzled with chocolate syrup. Thinking about it makes me salivate. ha ha

I love the decor of the little town!  I think it is so cute!! Our waitress was very attentive. She knew exactly when to check up on us.

The cheese offering was disappointing and the bread and croissant, lackluster. They had pâté, but no mousse.

The French onion soup, prime rib, creamed spinach, and sautéed mushrooms were exquisite! The coffee was fresh and strong and the crème brûlée delicious.

They have a lot of French dishes. I got to try ratatouille, or as my nephew call it, ratatooti. I also found out, I don't really like it. They have a small selection of breads (cranberry, garlic and basil, regular French bread) throughout the buffets. I love how they have plenty-a meats and vegetables. Their glazed sweet potato and green beans were so delectable and yummay! They have grilled bell- pepper, squash, hummus, red potatoes, brussel sprouts, broccoli florets, you know, the good shite.  The meats include beef, pork, lamb, chicken, fishies. There's also a small selection of (crappy) sushi, but I could care less for the sushi when there's plenty of other good foods abound.

The salad station was also very weak, and honestly I had wanted to fill up on good veggies or fruits.  There were not a lot of vegetable options and the fruits that were there (ex cut up honeydew) looked old and unappealing.  The best items I had there were the steamed clams, steamed mussels, a berry crepe, and the macaroons.

I can't believe some server actually took the time to take those filthy pieces of silverware, put them in a napkin and ROLL THEM UP in it.  Just not worth the price.  Sorry!

I've been to Village for all 3 meals before and lunch is definitely the worst. Dinner is average, and breakfast is the best. 

But lunch this time around was so pathetic. The selections are really heavy on the meat. Veal, roast beef (which is dry and inedible), pork, chicken, sausages, everything. I'd normally love a meat-centric meal, if it were actually good. But the quality of the meat was just horrible, and it's not like it had been sitting out for a few hours - we got to lunch just as they were switching over from breakfast. Meat and bread?! What kind of peasant meal is this?! Though I'd probably have difficulty laying out a strong selection for lunch. What are you supposed to serve anyway, sandwiches?! Lunch should be dinner, but lighter.. and with eggs. 

The desserts were also pretty lame.. I was excited they had French macarons but the creme brulee was more flan than creme boo. The one thing I can say is that the coffee was good, and unlimited. 

I'm not liking their fluorescent blue lighting in the main room - if you can, get seated in the tiny dining rooms off to the side with warm lighting and French accents. Warm lighting is important to a healthy appetite!

Some times, you go and eat a ton ignoring the quality of the food.  Other times, you go and eat as much as you can knowing full well that you're scarfing down some good restaurant grade grub.  Le Village Buffet falls kind of in the middle.  

The Ups:
Good Crepes

The downs:
Crab Legs not always fresh tasting and hard to eat
Desserts selection is sub par (Minus the crepes)
Service

The middle grounds:
The prime rib, chicken, veggies, pastas, rice, etc.

So what, why?  When you have so many choices of buffets in a place like vegas, there's no reason you should go somewhere you don't love.  Honestly, most the food is just okay and one of the biggest appealing things for me is the snow crab\/king crab legs.  Since this place's weren't that good, it's just okay by my standards.  That and the waitresses that served us on multiple occassions were not attentive.

The champagne brunch on Sunday was just terrific as you can have unlimited champagne or mimosa's. The buffet here has a lot of variety and you can get crepes here made to order plus other cooking stations around for made to order items. The prime rib and tri-tip steak was just heavenly good, tender and moist. Yumm!!!

This is one of my favorites in term of ambience because it looks like a small village inside the buffet. Very cozy if you can get a table right in the middle of where the buffet area is at and the lighting is lower there.

Another con is that the buffet looks huge from the outside, but when you get inside you realize most of that is just seating. There is usually a long line to get in, but I imagine that is how most of the casino buffets are so no surprises for anyone there.

3 stars for the food, they have a decent selection of sea food and French cuisines. My favorite is the bouillabaisse?? (spell check please haha) Our server was really nice and was on top of everything. The dessert section was pretty lacking, and it only has two flavors of ice cream.

I noticed that only a tiny trickle would come out into my cup. I tried to unscrew the lid of the pitcher  so that more coffee could come out easier- a totally normal thing to do. Galo rushed to my table and literally ripped the pitcher out of my hands saying ""No No No!!!"" I just stared at him, not understanding what was going on.

He walked away but while he was less than a full table away, he said ""please...!"" In a tone of voice that told me he was annoyed that I hadn't said it.

I don't appreciate it. That meal was expensive and I don't deserve to be treated like that for absolutely no reason. Why did Paris sit us at a table with a used up carafe of coffee? Gross.

I'm normally not a fan of buffets. Mostly because, while I eat a lot, I don't eat *a lot*, and I always feel like I'm wasting my money because I don't gorge myself at every station. 

It's also been a while since I've gone to any buffets in Vegas, so my recollections of the food offered bordered on blah.  From what I remembered, you weren't going to have any outstanding culinary experiences, so I preferred to spend my money at sit-down restaurants with fancy menus and, you know...portion sizes.

Of course, our most recent trip out to Vegas turned everything around. We were there with my Vegas-loving, Vegas-knowing cousin, who pretty much planned every meal of every day, with the bulk of our meals happening at various buffets around town.

We came to Le Buffet for our pre-race morning meal, hoping to get our protein and carb fixes while sampling some of the other, non-racer-approved food items.

The wait wasn't terrible, which was a huge bonus. We really didn't want to stand in line for an hour or more a few hours before we were supposed to run 13.1 miles. I'd say we waited about half an hour before we were shown to a table.

The food was impressive - they had a good array of breakfast and lunch items, as well as desserts - and I enjoyed pretty much everything that I got. I only had issues with two food items: the cream cheese that I put on my bagel (with smoked salmon and capers) and the egg dish that I chose. The cream cheese had a strange flavor to it - almost like a ""dusty"" flavor, for lack of a better term. The egg casserole dish had ham and cheese in it, but was very runny and had a very sweet note to the base that I didn't expect and didn't like.

But everything else was good. I ate way too much, and then went back for more. How I thought that was a good idea, I'll never know.

I'm removing a star for our waitress and for the missing food labels.

Our waitress was terrible. I mean, *terrible*. We each ordered a drink (OJ for my cousin, coffee for my husband and a glass of water for me). She brought back the two cold drinks, and put the pot of coffee on the table, then walked away. Did she have a coffee mug for my husband? No. We kept waiting for her to come back with one, or to just swing by anyway, but she never did. We finally had to poach a coffee cup AND a pot of creamer from the table next to us, since she was basically a no-show.

She never came by to check on us, or to refill my (rapidly emptied) water glass. She DID, however, stop by with another glass of water towards the end of our meal. She totally could have completely changed my opinion of her by saying, ""Here's a water refill for you"", or something along those lines. Instead, she said, ""I have this extra glass of water that nobody wants. Do any of you want it?""

Stellar!

The missing food labels were confusing. The buffet had been open for a few hours by that point, but the labels were either all wrong, or they were missing completely. It's not too big a deal, but when you're trying to figure out if that hunk of meat is beef or pork, a label would be handy.

Still, we enjoyed our meals and left feeling (overly) full. I think it's a good deal, for the amount of food offered and the price you pay. And I'd absolutely go back just for the macaroons alone!",1,1,0

Very easy to access(being btwn the walkway to the Bally's and Paris casinos), this is one of my preferred AYCE locations.  The line for this buffet seems to be one of the longer ones; ranging from an hour to 2 1\/2 hours long.  Has been rated one of the best buffets around, and the long lines seem to be reflective of that.   Anyway, probably one of the ones I liked better than the other buffets on the same range(btwn the $25-35 buffet range.  It's different when you go to the Bellagio and Wynn buffets...that's like comparing a regular old cherry to a reineer cherry.  Definitely not as many options as the Rio World Buffet, but it has a decent selection.  Skirt steaks and the desserts make this buffet very enjoyable.  I particularly liked the pasta options.  Again, try a little of everything - and you'll find what you like and what you don't like, but I'm sure you'll find something. =)",0,0,0

First of all the breakfast was considered brunch on Sunday and was over $30. The service was absolutely the worst. Our waitress for drinks took only half of the tables order and ignored the others (despite all four of us sitting there) so when we got up and approached her to ask for two additional waters she acted put out and said she would bring four. She then proceeded to only bring 3 waters and we had to ask repeatedly for the fourth - which she finally brought at almost the conclusion of our meal and spilled on one of the people in our party. The crepes were tasty but a thirty minute wait in line for a crepe is excessive. It seems like they need more support. All of our other food was completely cold by the time we got the crepes.

However, we didn't have to wait long for a seat, we were shown quickly to a place close to the food and seated. 

The first thing I noticed? The overwhelming stink of seafood. To me, it turns my stomach. I'm certain to others ""fresh fish & seafood"" smells great, but it made me want to throw up.  But I put that aside as we all took our seats and the majority of our party went to get in line and serve themselves up some food. 

There were MANY Selections. Everyone came back with something different, something good. For me, My first stop was the salad bar. I chose a Caprese salad and a bowl of some of the best potato leak soup I've ever had the pleasure of eating. It was made with real cream, and you can tell the difference that makes.  The Caprese salad was good, but there wasn't any basil left on the plate. *sad* I had a small green salad too, but the grilled chicken I chose to go with it, was awfully dried out.

For my main course, I chose steamed veggies, some potatoes augratin, sauteed mushrooms, Prime rib that was a bit over done, grilled lamb, taziki sauce and some parmesan flat bread.  The food was, for the most part, well done and very tasty. 

Dessert was a bit of a challenge, but I looked through the options and chose to have my first Macaroon, a Macaroon tart with black berries, a Creme caramel & a lemon tart. I wasn't impressed with the green macaroon. The Macaroon tart with black berries was FABULOUS. The creme caramel (Aka flan) Was ok, and the lemon tart was.. no, there was no lemon, it was a pastry shell with meringue. GROSS.  

So for the most part, the buffet would have been fine at $25, but so not worth the extra money, especially if you don't eat from the sushi and raw bar, which none of us did... As one of my party said ""I wanted to try the sushi but it doesn't look fresh or healthy",2,0,0

Then there was nothing to eat and the prime rib was just ok and for the other meat dishes the meat was so tough i had a hard time putting my knife through it. I was still hopeful for the ready made crepes but they failed to satisfy. The berry crepe was wayyy too sweet and the savory crepe was just so-so. Even the bread wasn't so good- I mean i've had better bread from my local supermarket.

Dinner:
There are many stations full of tons of full. The best things that I ate were the Prime Rib, cooke perfect and tender. The Beef rib was moist and tender. The brie, bacon, macaroni and cheese was one of the most delicious pasta dishes i have ever eaten. Roasted veggies would have been better if they had just been roasted. Truffle Mashed potatoes deliciously fluffy but couldn't taste the truffle. Dessert crepes were very good.

Breakfast:
Still full from the night before, we went to breakfast earlier than we wanted to because the line for breakfast is outrageous if you don't get there before 9am. 

Breakfast in some ways seemed like leftover dinner. The turkey sausage stuffed with sweet potato was the left over turkey breast grounded and then stuffed with the left over roasted sweet potato, not impressive tasting, but i like the resourcefulness of not wasting some of their food. Breakfast crepe apple was very good and huge row of fresh fruit that was ripe and delicious. The smoked salmon for bagels and lox was very good.

Got me some grilled chicken that was juicy and flavorful, tasty roasted potatoes, AMAZING yukon gold mashed taters, and this creamy truffled pasta they had? Omg. I pretty much filled my second plate with just that lol.

They had brioch french toast which was just okay. It was moist, but meh.

I dont know. Its kind of like love and hate relationship with this buffet and I. First of all, I would have never paid the full price to go to this buffet ever if it wasnt for the Buffet of Buffets pass. I happened to stay nearby Paris so I thought I should come here.

I found three things I liked from here. First things first, I liked the interior. How they managed to have the buffet to look like a french village with the blue sky ceiling is pretty different from any other buffets I have gone to in Vegas. 

Second, my server was so nice. She had a hard accent but she was so polite and kind. She was super attentive and checked up on us frequently. I really appreciated that.

Third, their crepes! Besides those two I mentioned, their crepes were the best! I only got to try the Mixed Berries Crepe since I was not as hungry as I should have been. My friend said their nutella crepe is super good too but I didnt get to try. My mixed berries crepe was really good. It wasnt overly sweet and the crepe itself was really moist!

Their prime rib was probably the best out of all the other buffets I went within Buffet of Buffets(excluding Bacchanal).

While in line, I pulled up their Yelp review. Reviews were mixed, most good, some bad. We just went for it and boy was it worth it.

With your total rewards card you receive $3.00 then we had the coupon for $5.00 more off which came to a total of $23.00 for two. Not too bad at a Vegas buffet. We were seated pretty quickly after paying then it was on.

There is something very depressing about the lighting of this faux village. It is like perma dusk, but ugly. The limited food options do not make up for the environment. Among the offenses:

- This place promotes its crepe bar, but it shouldn't. Le Village Buffet managed to do the impossible: It ruined Nutella. They slather on way too much Nutella for their crepes. There are no fresh fruit options available. My friend took a banana from another part of the buffet, cut it up and asked them to put the banana in a Nutella crepe. They didn't understand this and instead put banana inside and Nutella outside.

- The only real seafood option was tiny shrimp that looked like it came from a freezer bag. You also had to shell the shrimp yourself.

- Things like broccoli and tortellini were dry and undercooked. Even the pears -- something that requires no cooking, just putting out for people to take -- were so unripe they were inedible.",1,0,0

There are many different stations catering to that particular region's specialty.  You can't go wrong with the eggs benedict or the butter croissants.  The crepes are okay; they are a little too doughy.  The quiche Lorraine and their tarts are delectable!

I had heard good things about this place and read the reviews here on yelp.  This was our first stop (for breakfast) and we were ready to eat!     

We were seated quickly, there was no line.  Our hostess was a very kind woman.  The waitress wasn't all that great and really didn't do much other than get my party 1 refill (we were there for about an hour)

At first glance it seemed like a clean place, and I had hoped the food would be great.  Sadly...it was not.  My first plate was biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs, and hash browns.  I also grabbed a small bowl of oatmeal.  

The overall quality of the food was really bad.  The eggs looked fantastic, however they had no flavor and they were very watered down.  The hash browns were cold, and again had no flavor.  I took one bite of the B&G and that was enough to know that I didn't like it.  The oatmeal I will admit though was pretty much as good as oatmeal can be.   

I ordered Milk and I was very surprised that they brought me whole milk and that was pretty awesome, the waitress brought me 2 big glasses, I got a refill on 1 and ordered a chocolate milk, I was disappointed with the chocolate milk as that was not whole milk...it also tasted sour.

I went back to look at the other foods offered, and based off looks alone I wouldn't eat anything else from there other than fruit.  The bacon and sausage looked very undercooked, I have a thing about bacon being cooked crispy, this bacon was floppy and you could see through it, my girlfriend tried both meats and she said it was pretty bad.  I don't recall everything my lady had but she wasn't happy with it.   We left after that. 

So for me, the only good thing about this buffet I liked was the Milk, Oatmeal, and Fruit.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone at least not for breakfast, though if they can't make breakfast I can't depend on them to make anything else. I gave it a 2 for the way the place looked, and for the high quality milk.",1,1,0

I thought it was a great deal coming here during dinner, they also have a gryos section. The only thing that I didn't like here was that the women's restroom was only one stall by the gyros section. Thank god there wasn't a huge line. 

One thing that I highly recommend is sign up for the Total Rewards Card at any of the Harrah's properties and get the 24 hour buffet pass for 34.99 + tax. It's an amazing deal that my friends got. :)",0,0,0

Worst service I've ever had in my life! I'm not just talking your regular rude and slow here... I'm talking outright crazy!

She was in such a rush she was gone before we even finished our drink orders, when I yelled to her that I also wanted champagne since it's a champagne brunch she yelled ""yea yea I'll get to it!  One thing at a time!"". When we got back to our seats our drinks and champagne was there but as we finished our drinks there was no crazy lady in sight.

Told us all she is doing the best she can but all we need are refills... they can wait. She actually got in an all out argument with someone else who just wanted a champagne refill! It made the whole area feel uncomfortable and as many times as other people also complained about her nothing was done.
Bottom line, service sucks! It was not bottomless refills bc we couldn't get service to bring us any refills. And the food was just mediocre. Nothing to brag about. For $35 I expected better!

The major standouts at Le Village were the prime rib, the pesto pasta, the custard vanilla ice cream, and the flan. 

The prime rib was very tender, very juicy, and cooked seemingly just right. There was enough flavor within the meat and the au jus that no horse radish was needed. 

The pesto pasta was probably the best pesto I've had outside of my own kitchen. Granted, my exposure to pesto sauces is not too vast, but I'd say that Le Village did this one solid. There was solid flavor, they used a good amount of garlic and pine nuts, the pasta was a perfect texture.

The flan was pretty delicious although I typically like my flan more dense than light. My guests concurred that the flan was of a good texture. The custard vanilla ice cream was very thick and dense and the added 'oomph' of the custard made for an extremely thick and smooth feel. Good anchor to the rest of the meal.

And that's pretty much where the good stuff ended. Everything else was your seemingly generic Vegas buffet offerings. One thing to stay away from was the Mediterranean selection section. The lamb was jerky, all of the kabobs, hummus, and dolmas have been sitting out for wayyy too long and you could just tell to stay away. I gave it a shot and sadly regretted it.

Our server was very strategic. Always gone when we needed her, always present when not. Granted, all we really needed was refills on our drinks and plates to be removed when done, but she just seemed to be a little inefficient in her service.

Overall, Le Village may be the best, if not, the 2nd best offering in the Buffet of Buffets selections. Aside from the dishes that I praised above, nothing else really stood out.",1,0,0

like many other buffets, you have a variety of stations from asian to Mediterranean, breakfast, to italian.  my favorite is definitely the made to order crepe station! the only thing it really lacks is seafood. but i guess if you really want seafood you'd just go to Rio. 

my overall experience here is good, the food was delicious. the one thing that made me chuckle was that the busboy accidently cleaned our table thinking we left already (even though we still had our jackets hanging on the chairs). when we got back to our table, everything was cleared off, including our drinks. i didn't get upset becuz this was actually the second time it happened on this same trip but at a different buffet.",2,2,4

I don't actually remember that far back ro determine whether or not it's a good change or bad... I think  I'll make my final decision at the end of this review.

I guess I'll start off with what I liked- MACARONS. Similiar to many teenagers\/pre-teen\/adolesents (whatever the hell I am), I like to go with whatever is ""in"" right now. At the moment, I believe that these pricey little pastries ranging from $1.50 to $3.50 are the hype of hype. I guess it's because of how expensive it is. Anyways, there were macarons here. I think I ate 4 or 5. I understand that there are now macarons in almost every Vegas buffet, but I do believe it wasn't here before. The last time I went, there were very few pastries that I think I enjoyed. (Actually, I don't think I was a French-obbessed person then, so it might have been there and I haven't noticed.)

Well, in that case, I think I just wasted a whole paragraph. Because as I'm strolling through the buffet (Yes, I'm too full to be sitting down so I'm walking instead), I can't name one extraordinary thing about this place. Everything was rather medicore- nothing I wouldn't find at my hometown. 

Most of their meat dishes were too salty. Their baguettes were sort of stale. (Okay, I'm Vietnamese so I'm used to crunchy French bread). The majority of the dishes were the same with just the sauce altered. Their macarons were actually tasting a bit stale-chewy (I don't know if any of you know what I'm talking about) after the 3rd one or so. Their crêpes aren't all that good. I had ""La poulet"" (Um... isn't the word for chicken masculine?) . The chicken honestly looked like smashed little rocks or something. It wasn't really favorful or anything. I guess I should've tried a sweet crêpe. Another thing I'd like to point out is that the desserts section composes of around 4-5 dishes. There are many different plates, but each plate contains the same thing. When I was there, it was some mushy cheesecake and chocolate mousse. There WERE chocolate chip cookies (French, right?) but even that got switched out. Now everything's peanut butter cookies. The labels for about 30% of the dishes were wrong. I think 90% of the mislabeled foods were in the desserts section, though. 

I'm not a big fan of seafood, but their crab legs appear pretty fresh. In fact, the chefs cook the pasta and other dishes right in front of you. Other sections (ahem- desserts), seem to have stacks and stacks of premade, stale food.

Overall, the scenery and overall environment were pretty good. I apologize for my inconsistant opinion. There are few good things and there are a few bad things. 

One of the last things I'd like to mention is that some of the French is incorrect. I suppose the creators just wanted to put conjugates so Americans could understand it better. Although I might be wrong on my part. I'll have to ask my teacher for confirmation. It's not a big part of my review, and this isn't affecting my rating.

I got there for breakfast and got to look at the omlette bar right before they took it down. They do tend to focus a little more on ""french"" food and desserts, but it's still your standard buffet fare. This buffet is better than the average buffet because there is a HUGE amount of variety, even for a Vegas buffet. 

I really liked the way that even inside the buffet, they made an effort to continue the Parisian small town motiff. Servers are dressed up peasant style (my memory might be faulty and it might have just been the seating hostesses. . . my mind was fully preoccupied on crepes)

For those who sleep in late, or are stuck in the long line outside worrying about missing out on delicious food, don't worry! They WON'T kick you out once breakfast is over. You can just sit there, nurse your pleasantly stuffed belly, and wait till you feel like continuing on to lunch!

While the food it self wasn't particularly memorable (we have done the buffet at the Palace hotel in San Francisco, which is the best buffet) the ambiance set the scene for what was an enjoyable experience.

The food selection here is diverse and will please most, unless they come expecting mostly French cuisine. The options range from everything from Japanese (sushi) to Mediterranean (hummus). While there are some big winners to pick, like the mozzarella and tomatoes or the crepes, there are some so-so options you will have to deal with as well. The real allure of Le Village Buffet, however, is its appearance. The theme is a quiet little village, while capturing a slightly overdone decor (think Fantasyland at Disneyland) to make it memorable.

We arrived at 6:20 to see a huge line and we were a bit concerned. We were seated at 8:40. Unfortunately, there were lines both inside and outside, as there were lines for the individual food stations. The line to get meat from the carving station took another 15 minutes. Lines everywhere!

I wish they had split up their carving stations. There was one person carving the three meats (prime rib, pork, and turkey). When people got there, they would ask questions about the meat, or ask what each meat was, or want specific cuts\/parts of one or two meats and not all three. I think it would make for a better dining experience if they split up these carving stations or spaced them out more. The lines got so bad that a man (maybe the manager?) came by to try and get people to go to another station, where there was turkey. Most people stayed in line for the pork and prime rib.

Food quality was disappointing. The first piece of prime rib I got was way too well done. The second piece was rare and red in the center. The duck was really dry. The crab legs tasted so salty that I could only eat a couple. They also stuck to the shell, which made me think they weren't that fresh. I basically filled up on various roasted vegetables and sausages, which I could get anywhere for less than half the price.

I had heard so many good things about the dessert bar, but when I finally got to dessert, 1\/4 of the station (gelato? ice cream?) was cleaned up. Of the desserts that were left, they were just the same handful of desserts placed at different areas of the station. The crepe station also had a huge line, and when I finally got my crepe, it was monster-sized (not in a good way). There was so much filling in there that my family of four people couldn't even finish one.

Since it was a holiday, we paid for the holiday price. Including tax and tip (the only saving grace was that the waitress came by occasionally to clear plates and refill drinks), it came out to $45+ per person.

BAD: EVERYTHING looked soaked in oil. The veggies were in butter baths. The pastas had pools of oil seeping in where ever you scooped it out. The fish (surprisingly NOT in oil) was so hard my fork couldn't even penetrate the meat. The buffet was slammed packed and I saw them constantly bringing out new food, but that was just as bad as the old stuff. A lot of it looked like it was made ealy in the morning and then stored under a heat lamp until dinner time.

GOOD: The prime rib was surprisingly good (the horseradish not so much) and the crepes were really good.

The coffee was good; everything else was kind of average.  The eggs in particular - can SOMEBODY please teach the kitchen how to cook non-runny scrambled eggs?  I mean, I know they're coming out of a carton somewhere, but at least allow them to set a little before serving them.

They were also very lax on getting the empty stations restocked - there wasn't any smoked salmon out the entire time I was there, and given that it wasn't rush hour or anything that's kind of puzzling.

Highlights were the potatoes (yum) and the chicken sweet potato sausage (weird, but good!)

Anyways. the selection of food was very small. They had a bit of asian entrees but was very weak. the kung pao chicken taste like something else. They had sushi. The white rice was cold. I ate about 4 slice of prime rib. They had some delicious Maccaroons though. For $33 I will go somewhere else.

The place was crowded, so much so that it seemed a little dirty, like they couldn't tidy up fast enough. 
 
The bad:
The ginger ale tasted extremely watered down.

The stone crab claws were already cracked somewhat, but I tried a few different ones and was unsuccessful at getting anything OUT of them and also managed to slice my finger open trying. Friend got some of the snow crab legs, but they just looked soggy and aged to me.

I was excited to see the brie and bacon mac and cheese, but was promptly disappointed by the quality.

The decent: 
The lamb was good and not gamey. Crepe station was pretty neat- long wait, and not Spectacular, but worth it.


Overall, I don't remember a darn thing about this food. So very unremarkable.

and the good: 
the reason this place gets 2 stars is the Creme Brulee!!! I lucked out and snagged some, but a friend went to get dessert and came back without, saying the chef was caramelizing the tops and they weren't out yet. I went back to try the remaining desserts and she asked me to pick her up a creme brulee, but they were out again by that time.

- Green beans

At $30 for dinner, it's a little pricey but what buffet in Vegas isn't anymore? Next time, I'll be sure to take advantage of the $45 all-you-can-eat in 24 hours deal, which included six buffets in the Harrah's family of casinos.",0,0,1

I was visiting from out of town and we stopped here for dinner after the Jersey Boys show. We heard the food was good and worth the money. We had 8 in our group and each of us paid individually. Only AFTER we paid, we were notified that parties of 8 or more automatically have to add 17% gratuity. Barbara, the lady standing and taking tickets insinuated (rudely) that she wanted us to go back to the cashier to repay with the 17% added to each persons ticket. We asked if we could add it at the end or use cash and she huffed and puffed while taking all of our tickets and pulling the hostess aside to see how to handle our group. 

Not sure why NO BODY mentioned the gratuity until after we paid and there were no signs posted until after we rounded the corner where the hostess was standing. Not our problem that they had poor placement with their sign or that the people taking our money didn't bother to give us a heads up. After that issue, the staff was rude to our whole group. They ended up slitting our group into two and sitting us at opposite ends of the restaurant, then proceeded to give us dirty looks our whole meal. The ""waitress"" barely said two words when she came to ask what we wanted to drink, 3 waters and one Sprite. She dropped off a tall jar of water for us to refill our drinks ourselves and never came back once to refill the Sprite or check to see how things were going. And they wanted us to tip our server 17%? The only person worth tipping was the gentleman that came and grabbed our empty plates. He was the only kind person on their staff. 

On top of all the drama, the food wasn't very good and we sat across from what I'm guessing is the wait staff room and the floor was a mess, which I have included a picture of. I will 100% NOT be returning to this place if I come back to visit and I think any one thinking of dining here should be aware that the staff is rude.",3,1,0

None of the food stood out as particularly amazing, but I'd have to say that the highlights were probably the brie and bacon macaroni and the prime rib. I was in a breakfast mood so I also tried the eggs benedict, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, and a crepe. The bacon and sausage were good, but the scrambled eggs were way watery and had a very odd consistency. The eggs benedict was pretty good, but it seemed like it had been sitting out for a while. 

However, we were a bit disappointed when we had been sitting at our table for about 15-20 minutes and our server told us that they had completely run out of champagne. How do you run out of champagne for a champagne brunch? That made absolutely no sense to me. They offered us wine after a while, but I was really looking forward to the champagne....boo. It would have been nice if they had comp'ed us something at least. 

If you do decide to come here, I'd come early so they don't run out of champagne on you.

I hate the idea of over-paying for mediocre food, just so that you can stuff yourself to near unconsciousness (to ""get your money's worth"") and feel disgusting afterwards. This has been my experience with most buffets in the past and why Le Village Buffet at Paris Hotel and Casino was such a pleasant and delicious surprise. 

I went to this Buffet with my mom, husband, and two kids for the Champagne Brunch on a Sunday. First of all, UNLIMITED MIMOSAS...nuff said, right? But then they took it a step further and had amazing food. The French Toast was incredible, scrambled eggs were well seasoned (which is rare, even if you're not at a buffet), sausage was plump and juicy, and the bacon was crisp and perfectly cooked. But the real show-stealer was the crepe station. There was a bit of a line, but it was well worth the wait. They had about 8 selections to choose from (4 sweet, 4 savory) and each was made to order right in front of you. This buffet is worth coming to for the mimosas and crepes alone. But I of course had to try the creme brûlée as well, and it was fantastic...not the best I've had, but no doubt delicious. 

The only reason I did not give this buffet 5 stars is because only the breakfast food was enjoyable. Being brunch, I felt that some of the more lunch-type items were seriously lacking in comparison to their breakfast counterparts. Not even worth eating, in my opinion. But our server was friendly and attentive (also a rarity at a buffet) and she kept the mimosas coming.

If you are staying at the Paris casino, or find yourself with feet tired of walking up and down the strip all day, this buffet will get the job done.  However, if you have the time and energy, I recommend checking out one of the other buffets on the strip such as Wynn or Bellagio.

We had the Buffet of Buffets pass, so we could go to 8 buffets in 24 hours that are all part of the Harrah's casino chain.  (No we didn't make it to all 8, but oh did we try!)  Le Village is the little brother of buffets on the strip, with more limited offerings and a smaller seating area.  

The wait wasn't too bad, so if you hate lines you might have a better chance of getting in quick here.  Although I have generally found that the longer the line the better the buffet!  When we were seated and started our multiple rounds of plate filling and emptying I found that a lot of the stations were slow to re-stock.  It was about 8:00, and they close at 10:00, so I think they stopped replacing the food in order to reduce throw-away.  Makes sense, but still disappointing since I am not one of those people who come back from the the buffet counters with the leaning tower of food stuffs on my plate.  By the time I went to get some of the dishes, it was only to find that they had run out.

Going off the assumption that Paris is a French place, and Le Village sounded distinctly French, I planned to go directly to the foods that were hard to pronounce expecting to be wowed by something more unique than the standard Prime Rib that all buffets have.  

Ratatouille - Not bad for a vegetarian dish.  It had a little spice and heat to it which made it very flavorful.  Since my only prior experience with Ratatouille was the mouse movie I was pleasantly surprised.

Crepes - Yes, everyone has crepes these days, but they are admittedly very good here!  The crepe chef wasn't French, but I will give them a pass on that one.

Chateaubriant sauce - This French sounding sauce goes with the non-French sounding beef tri-tip and was absolutely amazing.  Viva le fusion!

French Onion Soup - It is right there in the name everyone.  However I have had much better at local restaurants here in LA.  And since it is buffet style, it was missing the cheese covered topping on the bowl that I associate and love with this dish.

Sauteed Mushrooms - A very simple dish and pretty universal, but they used some amazing marinade that really kicked it up a notch.  I made two trips for these guys before they ran out and never re-stocked them.

Crab - A staple in all great buffets, was practically non-existent.  Don't go here if you are looking for great seafood in general.

The rest of the food was either at or below par with other buffets, so nothing to really comment on.  To re-iterate my initial assessment, this place will work in a pinch, but if you have the time and energy, try one of the bigger buffets on the strip and eat up!",3,1,1

Don't wait in line for the crab legs. Don't get the beef medallions. The seafood is highly mediocre, but the lamb is great. The grilled veggies are fantastic. Get some of of the carrots and cilantro. The brie is, well, brie-elicious. OH, and the sugar-free raspberry tarts are amazing too.

I always look forward to eating there. We were supposedly seated at a preferred Platinum Club table. Our table was around the corner from the Provence section: right where all the buffet staff comes in and out of the kitchen with huge carts on wheels, clattering along the cobblestone floors, making horrendous noises throughout the meal. There was nothing relaxing about this meal! The food did not feel up to par to us. I always loved the individual servings of beef bourguignon and things like that, but there were none of those. One prime rib looked positively raw. The sushi was boring (only two kinds). There were no chicken dishes that I saw. The salads were bland. I've always been intrigued by the crepe station, but the line is always so long and slow that I have never taken the time to get one. I have bragged up this buffet to so many people--it was really a bit embarrassing. I still love the creme brulee and macaroon cookies for dessert, but I'm not sure they're worth going there just for that. The cashier and server were very nice.

Unfortunately, it was not as good as it used to be. We found that several things on the buffet were cold, the corned beef hash now has ground up corned beef where in the past it was pieces, the turkey bacon as sitting in water and there was very little fresh fruit available.  

When we mentioned these things to the manager he did not seem to care.  He had a answer for everything from ""the turkey bacon is just an inferior product"" to ""we can't make any money if we put out better\/more fruit and berries"".  It was very shocking.

All of this could have been OK if we would have had better service.  We were asked what we would like to drink when we paid (on the way in) and the drinks were delivered while we were getting our food.  I ordered hot tea with cream and I was given two Earl Grey teabags.  As I wanted plain black tea (i.e. English Breakfast) I tried to find our waiter to have the teabags changed out, but he was nowhere to be found.  I was half done with my first plate of food before he ever came out of the back.  We waved him down and I told him what I would like and he left the table without asking anyone else if they needed anything - and they did.  He returned with my teabags and one person asked for water and he turned to leave again without asking if there was anything else.  We grabbed him before he left, but I'm sure this is why he was not around - I saw him helping one person at a table at a time instead of helping the whole table.

It is one of the smaller buffet's I've been to but they offer a lot of dishes of french cuisine that you can't find in any other buffets. Their prime rib was perfectly cooked and juicy.

I loved that some of the things were simple little dishes, but packed with great flavor. 

They do have a crepe station! They can make them with any fruits and toppings they have on hand for you and they're all so delicious. If you come for breakfast\/brunch they do have an omelette station and offer unlimited small bottles of Korbel champagne.

The wait staff and service is slow. We came on a Saturday night and after being seated it took over 15 minutes to get our drinks. I was wondering what was taking so long and noticed it was only one guy taking drink orders and serving them on our side of the buffet. They are extremely over worked.

If you live in America this buffet is similar to Golden Corral. Noting new,, nothing amazing...",2,0,0

Okay, man who made fresh omelettes to my liking, I liked you.  BUT THAT'S ALL!  I could eat the exact same yummy omelette every morning in a dorm cafeteria, I wouldn't exactly call the omelette at Le Village extra special.

And the rest!?  Scrambled eggs 10 ways.  Whacksauce!!!!!!!  Crepe station....meh.  And don't be fooled into thinking the pastries are just like France either....they are SO not.

That'll be $22.99 for the omelette that I liked.  Oh dear!  I would so rather eat a breakfast sandwich at Earl's.  At least I came at 7:30 and didn't have to wait in the hour line that was formed by the time I finished.

So I didn't exactly pay $22.99, I did the 24 hour buffet pass...And well,  I decided to come back here for lunch to see if it could redeem itself.

Verdict?  The prime rib was good, but the only excellent item was the creme brulee.

Overall, the wait here is way too long and the food is not good enough to make up for it.  Not the complete picture but let's just say breakfast and lunch didn't impress me enough to ever try dinner.  COLLECT  $79.97 (breakfast: 22.99, lunch 23.99, and dinner 32.99) and PASS GO. As in, go somewhere else.",1,4,1

i didn't see anything that warranted the 35 bucks price tag.  however i didn't try the crepe station, i don't think it would have changed my mind.  the only redeeming factor about this place was the prime rib.  it was its only saving grace... and to be honest, it was mediocre at best.  

the seafood\/sushi section... i don't even want to talk about it.. i'm going to save my energy to write my next review..  it was ""bleh""

the dessert station was alright.. the best thing in my opinion was the creme brelee.

Some of the choices seemed not-so-good, but I remembered this buffet as being halfway decent when I had tried it years and years ago. 

The line was much shorter than on my first trip. I remember about 8-9 years ago, the line went out the door almost into the casino. This time, there were maybe 15-25 people ahead of us. They were a little slow with seating, but nothing outrageous. 

The food? Pretty good. I'd say the quality is fairly good, but the selection is a bit lower than my favorite (Bellagio), but still, you are presented with a pretty impressive spread. Then again, I just need a few staples done well with a few flourishes and I'm pretty happy. I'm fairly gluttonous at all-you-can-eat buffet set ups, and I was able to eat my fill. I think of everything I tried, there was only one thing that I didn't really enjoy.

The food was average, but not disappointing. The only two things I was sad about was that the 1st serving of eggs Benedict had an egg that had been cooked all the way through (due to the heat lamp) but since it's a buffet I just got another and it was fine.

The other thing that bugged me was that there Corned Beef Hash was made by simply using shredded Hash Browns as an ingredient. Just seemed like a lazy move to me.

  * Nearly everything I got was premium in taste
  * Lamb, Duck, Tri-Tip, and Crab . Yum !
  * Seating 
  * Atmosphere

Cons:
  * Felt rushed
  * No hot crab legs 
  * No discount offered with Player's Card
  * No flavored ice tea
  * Sushi didn't fancy me (nor did their Clam Chowder)
  
  After walking around the strip for quite sometime, my girlfriend and I decided we'd try this buffet out.  Price for dinner on a Monday night was $24.99\/pp.  In comparison to the rest of the places to eat around Paris, we thought it was a pretty good deal and we would get a variety.  

  Seating after entering the buffet came fast.  We were literally seated the minute we walked in (but it was 9:45 pm so I didn't expect a wait).  I like the atmosphere of the buffet.  It's almost as if it was a street corner full of restaurants.  It had the look as if you were dining outside.  It was different and I liked it.  We got seated in a corner that was near a wall.  No complaints there.  I actually like the fact that we wouldn't have to worry about people walking by every 5 seconds and accidentally bump into our chair or table.  

  When ordering my drink, I asked for Raspberry Ice Tea, but they didn't have that so I opted for Sierra Mist.  When I got to the actual buffet, I was pretty astonished at some of the stuff they had:  Sushi, Crab Legs, Lamb, Bow-tie Pesto, Poached Salmon, Clam Chowder, etc. etc... the list goes on. 

  Nearly everything I sampled was really good.  There were a few that I didn't care for much.  I figured mentioning those would do more good to anyone considering going to Le Village Buffet.  Read below under ""Tips"" for more info on what I didn't care for.  I would have given this place 5 stars, but the reason I didn't is because when arriving, I asked the lady at the register if there was still enough time to enjoy eating since it was near 10.  She told me we had an hour to eat before they would close down the buffet.  However, while eating; someone approached us at 10:30 and told us to make our final selections because the buffet was about to shutdown and that we would have to be out by 11.  I don't know why I was eating at the buffet this late anyhow, I get it.  It's just that the girl told me we had 1 hour when really we only had 30 minutes to actually get food at the buffet.  No biggie, we were practically done eating.  We did feel a little rushed (especially since my girlfriend didn't get a chance to make her way to the dessert yet).

Overall:

  Aside from feeling a bit rushed,  I'd say a really good buffet with some very tasty selections.  

Tips:
  *  Sushi was not good at all.  I had one piece and was done. 
  *  Clam Chowder was nice to see on the menu, but wow it was extremely thick and I'm not even exaggerating.  I love Clam Chowder, but Le Village's was just too much.
  *  Come before 10pm if you are eating dinner here.  10pm is last seating, but as you read above it would be wiser to come earlier.
  *  Don't forget to check out the very far left section:  this is where the lamb, tri-tip steak and other goodies are.  You can even make your own Gyro!
  * along w\/ making your own Gyro, there is a Crepe station too.  Yum.
  *  Come hungry!  Seriously!!",2,2,3

Most of the food was really good. My friends went nuts for the snow crab legs. We had plates and plates of those. No shame in our game! I'm not a shellfish kind of girl, but even I will admit that they were good. The steamed mussels and prime rib were really good as well. The quality and presentation of the food was spectacular. (Avoid the sushi they have in the corner; I know you did not just stand in line for over an hour to eat subar sushi!)

The crepe station was SO DELICIOUS, we had the Banana Nutella and the Strawberry Ricotta. They were both delicious but the Strawberry Ricotta beat out the Nutella one by a hair. Haha

I was up playing poker until 6:00am and was up around 10:00am so I was pretty tired and too lazy to walk\/drive anywhere to eat.  I always see a long line whenever I walk by the buffet.  I just thought the food must be OK.  Boy was I wrong!!!  

We didn't have to wait at all since we were able to go through Diamond entrance.  The cashier and host were very nice, so no complains here.    Long long time ago when Paris first opened, we did dine here once.  I could not recall my experience but I am sure it wasn't bad enough for me to remember it.  

The host led us to our table and took our drink orders.  She said to go ahead to the buffet and our server would get our drinks.  Well, when we returned to our table after getting our food, the drinks were not there.  When the waitress finally showed up, she had to ask what we wanted to drink again!  After she got our drinks, we hardly saw her again.  She was more interested in cleaning up tables than serving tables.  Maybe she should have taken a job as a bus girl instead of a server.  I had to flag her down a couple of times to get crab cracker (not sure if this is what it is called) and wet towelette.  She never came by to check if we needed refill or anything.  

And the food was the worst buffet I have ever seen.  The selections were very minimal.  The only thing good was the omelet from the omelet station, but who can mess up on omelet!  The crab legs were OK.  The crepe was bleh.  I also got a thin cut of what I thought was roast beef, but I am pretty sure I got lamb.  I don't eat lamb and I know the smell of lamb.  I couldn't tell until I sat down on the table and smelled the 'funny smell'.  I couldn't even take a bite.  I am really upset the lady mistaken the lamb for beef!  

I walked around trying to find something else to eat but nothing really looked appetizing.  I settled for a small bowl of salad.  I figured I could just get some dessert to make me happy.  When I walk around the dessert 'house', the place looked deserted!  There was nobody attending the dessert house!  There was no cookies, no cakes, just a few pieces of pies, and a soft-serve station.  I was a few fruit tarts inside but I couldn't get to them!  What the hell happened?  This is Paris!!!!  It's supposed to have good pastries, right?  

Both my fiance and I left in great disappointment.  And I am really upset I wasted $50 from my comp credit for this sh!%ty buffet!  My fiance filled out the survey card, but I am sure it'd just be thrown to the trash can.

2 things : the crepe station and the creme brulee

The crepe station was amazing since you can pretty much think of what ever crepe you want, and they will make it for you and you can come back for more.

""Banzai!"" from the Japanese bunch.  ""Mabuhai!"" from the Filipino bunch.  ""Here, here!"" from our haoles.  Even had one of our younger generation performing a lovely hula for all of us and those seated by our section.  That's us...spreading the Aloha spirit even when in Paris!

The dinner food selection was outstanding!
The various stations were well spaced so that, even on a busy Saturday night, civility reigned.

They even had a grilled section that was perfect for me.  Grilled veggies, meats & fish that I could enjoy without the fear of suffering from sauce overload later.  My stomach was already dancing from eating elsewhere, so this was appreciated.

The seafood cocktail section was pretty much wiped out by our clan.
Once they discovered how sweet & meaty the crab legs were, loaded up plates kept coming into our section to be shared.  I tried two claws, but I think they might have been previously frozen.  I stuck mostly to the peel shrimp and made my own horseradish cocktail sauce.

I was sorely tempted by the risotto that was popular with the gals.   From their exclamations, I'd say they were enthusiastic about mostly everything they tried.  

We had a lovely birthday cake for Auntie, but the others hit up that dessert station anyways.  I caved when someone put a creme brulee in front of me.  Soooooo good.  One of little kids in our group had four ice cream cones.  I did try a bite of one of those macarons that seems to be popular these days.  S'okay.

Service was good.  Our group was assigned two servers who were really on top of their game.

What I did not expect, however, was for the buffet line to have a wait time of 3-4 hours for dinner. Thankfully, we were one of the last few who were able to eat before the buffet closed, but I pity the poor souls who had to wait in line for 2-3 hours and end up not being able to eat at all.

With my grievances about the wait put aside, the price for the buffet is pretty standard as far as buffets go in Vegas, probably a little on the cheaper side. However, the food was mediocre, if even that. I don't know if it's because we were eating right before close time, but the food was getting cold and less stocked. In addition, for being called a ""French"" buffet, the macaroons were subpar.

my only complaint right now is about one of the operators that answer the phone, lorenz (phonetic)

the 10YO really wanted king crab legs, and i called around to different buffets to see which ones offered it earlier in the day. (we were leaving that day)  all the buffets i called prior to calling paris only served them with dinner.  when i called paris to see whether they had crab legs for breakfast or lunch, i was told that they don't.  then i asked what time the crab legs came out (because i really wanted to eat at paris before leaving)  and lorenz said they came out at 11:30 or so.  

ME:  ""Um, i thought you said they weren't served for breakfast or lunch.""
LORENZ:  ""They're not.  king crab legs are served during brunch""

REALLY?  are we playing word games here?  

basically, had i not asked what time the crab legs came out, i wouldn't have known, and we would have eaten elsewhere.

We paid $130 for three of us to have dinner. We really aren't an ""Al You Can Eat"" kind of family but we are willing to pay for a quality meal. Unfortunately we didn't receive that.
Luckily, we made reservations in advance on Open Table so we did not need to wait in the 1 hour plus line. We were seated after payment was taken and the server came by to get our drink orders. My 12 year old daughter, husband and I walked around the buffet to take in the offering before choosing what we wanted to eat. I started with a small bit of the two salads they offered and a half a cup of their potato leek soup. The salads weren't worth finishing, so I didn't figuring I would go back for something tastier. The soup was very good but also very fatty. My daughter go a piece of turkey with gravy and mashed potatoes. These were both good. Not amazing, but good. My husband got several crab legs that he said were ""pretty good"". On our second trip, I got the Truffle Macaroni and a roll. The Truffle Mac was very good and the roll wasn't anything special. My daughter got a plate of fruit which she said wasn't ripe. My husband got the Turkey and mashed potatoes. Then, since we hadn't been wow'd yet, we decided to try the crepes, which is what everyone raves about. My husband and I stood in line for 20 minutes to get our crepes. When we got back to the table, I cut open my Caprese crepe to find that the cheese wasn't even melted and the tomatoes were still cold. The same was true for my husbands ham and cheese crepe. In addition, the ham seemed low quality. What a bummer! My daughter then went to the crepe station and waited 25 minutes for her Nutella Crepe. This one was very good. I think they are trying to pump crepes out so fast that they aren't making them properly. There should be more stations to accommodate the busier hours. For Dessert we tried a selection of most of what they had to offering. The only things worth having more than one bite was the Creme Brûlée and the Purple Macaroon.

The crab legs were old and there were only 20 or so out and they were not being replenished by the staff. By far the worst buffet in Vegas. Save yourself some time and go to the Creperie across the hall from the buffet. For $8.99 you  have a delicious huge crepe that will fill you better  than the buffet ever could. I would not return to Paris on my next trip to Vegas. I wasnt too impressed. It is no Venetian.

In short, the pancakes, french toast, and english muffins under the eggs benedict were stiff, even after I watched the chefs put out a new bin. The crepes were also a real disappointment.  They were moist and chewy, almost underdone.  The fruit topping was more like pie filling.

For lunch, the lamb and prime rib were both below room temperature, though that happens at a lot of buffets since they skimp out by cutting the slices way thin.  Most of the other dishes were simply not worth remembering.  The one thing I did like about this place was that it was cheap, after getting a players club card and using the included coupon, it was 10 bucks per person.

They have little patisseries and French signs all over to make it feel authentic. The line for the buffet was quite long but moved surprisingly quickly. I was adamant about eating a crepe for breakfast so I refused to leave. What I really liked about this buffet in particular is they do not take a break from breakfast to lunch or dinner they just gradually change the dishes so I got to sample the breakfast and lunch buffet. The food was soooooo good. I had this amazing steak and potato has with real chunks of tender beef, smoked salmon, something that resempled scalloped potatoes without the cheese but lots of sautéed onions and mussels. They have stations that represent the different regions in france which I thought was a good idea and helps break stereotypes. I have no complaints about the food!  I wanted to go on my last day but I didn't have enough time. The crepes were divine. I ordered the mixed berry one and walked over to the ice cream stations and topped it off. PERFECTION!

A message to whoever runs it: invest in better chefs, better quality food, and a better selection for people who are spending their hard earned money to eat at your buffet. I will never go back to Paris buffet. Even the server didn't seem too caring... crack a smile.

I don't remember the bad but I definitely remember the good, so I'll mention those. 
I came here for breakfast and there was a 30-40 minute wait on a Tuesday. After we were seated, the waitress quickly brought us both orange juice and a pot of hot coffee. The omelet bar was my favorite. The chef spent a good amount of time making each omelete. He would first cook the stuff in the omelete: spinach, mushrooms, bacon, etc. then he would mix in the egg to cook it, finally he would ask if you want cheese and fold the cheese in last. There was salsa at the end of the bar. This was one of my favorite items for breakfast. The biscuit and gravy was good. I would avoid the scrambled eggs, they were a bit watery when we had them. Try to get the bacon on the top of the try, the bottom pieces tend to be more drenched in oil\/grease. The fruits are always good. The crepes were okay, I asked the chef to make mine a little thinner. They also give you a big scoop of cream. Since the fruits they use are quite sour, it helps cut the sourness :] 

I also came here another day for lunch since a friend wanted to come here. Surprisingly I wasn't disappointed. After having the pastas at PH's Spice Market, I was scared to try the pasta here, but they were really yummy and I'm glad I did. Definitely try all the pastas, I liked the pest tortellini, brie mac n cheese, and mushroom ravioli. The roast beef was really good, if you like medium rare you have to ask for it or else they automatically give you a medium well piece. If you like medium well and they only have rare pieces, ask the chef to put it on the grill to make it medium well. The grilled asparagus goes really well with the au jus and roast beef. Remember to bring pour some in a small bowl cause pouring it directly makes the other items on your plate absorb it. The sushi looked funky so I avoided those, but around the corner in the Asian-ish station was a steamed cod stuffed with a garlicy goodness. They have cold crab legs here, which I wasn't too fond of. If you want crab legs, go to Spice market. I also had the duck, it was okay, something to try. Okay, time for desserts! Everyone raves about the creme brulee, but not the best here. It was goood, but the sugar did not crack. They make so many of these, they just put them in the fridge after they burn the sugar so the sugar doesn't crack when your spoon smacks it. They still taste good but not OMG FRESH YUMMY good. Other good stuff: chocolate mousse tarte, croissant w\/ chocolate, cheesecake w\/ strawberry and bread pudding. 

Man this was a long review. So just come here for breakfast and try the pastas and roast beef if you come here for lunch\/dinner. Get the buffet of buffet pass and try this place for breakfast. If you want coffee to-go, just ask your waitress for a paper cup... and remember to tip them for being so nice :]",0,1,0

We went and got all our food and there were still no drinks. In fact, I finished my entire first round of food before even one person looked in our direction. I had to flag someone down to come and get our drinks. I'm not really sure why we ordered them in the beginning if nobody was going to bring them to us. 
After that, she came back one time to offer refills. We didn't leave a tip.

Upon arrival in Sin City, our first meal was at Le Village Buffet in Paris.  It's been years since I've been here and I couldn't see what was offered during the 30 minute wait in line.

I was a bit PO'd about being seated at the far end of the room, until I took a peek at the grilling station right in front of us.  New York Steaks! Hot off the grill and incredibly moist. Just the steak here would've been worth the price of admission, but a quick trip around the buffet area and I found an abundance of crab legs (and not the skinny ones at the chines buffets), bbq ribs, fried chicken.

It's been years since I've been in Tokyo and had a freshly made crepe so I made a beeline for the crepe station where there was an abundance of choices for a fruit and dessert crepes.  If a banana and nutella crepe isn't to your liking, there's a huge dessert stand in the center of the buffet.

My two favorite things about this buffet:  the crepe station and the atmosphere.

I've eaten here twice, but the first time was on the last day of my bachelorette party years ago and I don't remember a whole lot... ;)  This last time we went during our Buffet of Buffets experience (which I promise I'll review...soon) and I'd have to say it was my favorite buffet of them all.

We went for breakfast and I'm not a big breakfast person, so they had already started off at a disadvantage through no fault of their own!  We stood in line for a good while but once we got close to being seated and I could take in the full effect of the ambiance, my mood transformed!  How cute IS this place?!  The food is set up at little village ""cafes"" where you can choose from the selection of food.  We were seated in a little ""cottage"" off to the side...adorable.

The food selection ranged from your basic breakfast buffet foods...eggs, bacon, sausage, french toast, various types of potatoes etc.  There was an omelette bar, which I did not take advantage of because I was quite happy with my egg, mushroom, tomato scramble.  After my first plate of ""typical"" breakfast choices, I headed straight for the crepe station.  The line was substantial (I started to worry our server would clear our table thinking we'd left), but I was entertained by watching the crepes being made (now that's a talent I'd like to master!).  There are many choices...to make it easy to order, they organized the menu into savory (hearty meal-like) and sweet (more dessert-like).  You can also customize your order if none of the menu items tickle your fancy.  I went with the fruity berry one and my husband went with the banana and Nutella one.  Both were magnificently delicious!  Pretty too!  I'll have to search for some pics that I took...

Our service was decent.  Honestly, I was up and down so much getting food I didn't really have much need for anything.  She kept my juice replenished and I have no complaints.

The real experience was just the summation of it all.  It's hard to put my finger on it...but I felt a certain degree of ""special"" from this place...and that's why it gets the 5 stars from me.",2,1,1

Le Village Buffet is located in the Paris Hotel, but it can be accessed from Bally's through a tunnel passage between the two hotels. 

The line was long on a Tuesday at 10 am. I went to ask one of the staff members if I could move my mom (who's in a wheelchair) close to the entrance instead of lining up. She told me to go to the VIP line next door (VIPs had their own entrance, Woo Hoo). Instead of waiting over an hour, we were seated within 5 minutes =)

Because we were seated pass 10 am I paid the breakfast price ($25 each) for my group but was still there for the meal change to lunch at 11 am. Bonus!! Got to try both breakfast and lunch dishes. Yes!

The highlights for me:
Omelette station - custom made. Yum. 
Tip: you can also ask them to cook eggs only (sunny side up, over easy, etc etc) 

Mussel stew - plump and juicy. Yum. 

Clams w\/ sausage & basil - my favorite dish of the meal. Great broth and tender clams. Yum! 

Lemon meringue & Creme brûlée for dessert was delicious!!

Everything else I tried was just okay. 
French toast 
Shrimp cocktail - not deveined 
Smoked salmon 
Andouille sausage 
Corned beef hash - canned?
Soups. 

Service for our table was good. Refills and empty plates were handled efficiently.

After reading some tips in regards to the buffet of buffets my friends and I decided that the Le Village Buffet and the Spice Market Buffet were the only 2 buffets worth visiting. 

The Le Village Buffet definitely feels like a Vegas buffet. The interior resembles a small French village that successfully makes you believe that you've been transported to another country, but that is as French as it gets. Once you see the entrees offered you'll realize that the Le Village Buffet is just like any other Vegas buffet, with the exception of a full packed crepe station. Luckily the food at the Le Village Buffet is cooked very well.

Breakfast:
When we came for breakfast, my friends and I were excited to try some authentic crepes. Unfortunately the majority of the crepes offered were a let down. I tried a berry filled crepe, a banana nutella crepe, a ham and cheese crepe, and lastly a green onion chicken crepe. Out of the 4 the best was the banana nutella crepe and my least favorite was the green onion chicken crepe (I'd actually recommend not even ordering the green onion chicken crepe).

The other breakfast items offered were delicious. I strongly recommend grabbing an eggs benedict, (the hollandaise sauce was light but not overpowering, unlike the Spice Markets benedict which was unappetizing, due to the strong mayonaise taste), the carved ham was cooked to perfection, and the maple syrup polenta was simply too good. I'd avoid the bacon slab, which is basically a large thick cut of bacon; there was just too much fat and it was way too salty. 

Dinner:
Just a FYI, there's literally no special French entrees, so just keep that in mind when coming here for dinner. Overall the dinner items offered are very good. There's a good variety of selections, with the carving station being the highlight. The prime rib was moist and tender, and topping it off with some aju only made it better. I'd stay away from the crab legs though, they didn't seem very fresh and one of my friends actually left a little sick. Other than that the rest of dinner items offered were quite good.

Overall I'd definitely come back to Le Village Buffet, and if I do get the buffet of buffets pass again then I'll probably visit only this buffet, unless you purchase the premium buffets.  To good eatings :)",3,2,1

Last week, I came back to this former favorite to see what had become of it. It was a little bit disappointing.

I tried to hit a little bit of all the appetizing items. The prime rib was pretty solid. The beef bourguignon, pork belly, and the bouillabaisse were probably the standouts of the whole thing. Well, except for desserts. There were some really nice options, like the creme brulee and the cheesecake. My dessert crepe (#2 I believe, with the berries) was also good, if a little big.

The big problem is that the crab legs mostly sucked, and there was such a small serving area for it compared to huge platter that they used to have. What gives? Everybody knows you go to a Vegas buffet for crab legs. Also, the lamb was pretty dry, and there just wasn't as much of a variety as there are at some of the bigger buffets.

Luckily, I was able to use the Groupon on this trip and enjoyed a couple glasses of Blue Moon. They also have red table wine and something else that didn't sound appealing to my memory banks.

You can't deny the quantity of food. There was plenty.  Quality: now that's another issue.  Everything I ate was room temperature. Pasta. Room temperature. Meat. Room temperature. Soup. Room temperature.  There was no flavor in the food. Very disappointing.

Now, even though the food was terrible, it was not the worst part! The service was horrid.  Never in my life I thought to be treated this way. It started innocently by asking for a bowl for my soup.  I rudely heard ""ask your server"". I don't want to ask my server. I am asking you.  Then, I went to get some not-prime rib. After slicing my piece, the not-attendant literally threw the meat into my plate. ""Are you serious"" I thought. 

But, we were just getting started.  We have been in the restaurant for about 30 minutes, coming and going, trying to find something decent to eat. Since my utensils got dirty, I asked the server for some new ones. Nothing. I asked again. Nothing. I asked another person. Nothing. One more time. Nothing. Finally, I got up to get my own silverware. Than I hear ""I need to see your receipt"". I thought he was talking to someone else. Nope, he was directing his question to me. I explained I have been here for a while and ""don't you remember my handsome face"". ""No"" he replied. Anyway, I ignored him, got my fork and went back to suffer from the food on my plate.

When the waitress came to the table the first time she studied the receipt (which the hostess puts on the table). As it is a one price buffet, all I can surmise is she was checking for tip amount.

This visit, we made sure to fully enjoy the buffet. I took a tip from a fellow yelper. We went in at 10am, paying only for the low breakfast price, and stayed for lunch which started at 11am. I was so excited when it got close to 11am, what would happen? Would the food magically go from breakfast to lunch? I ate lightly for breakfast, saving my appetite for a hearty lunch. When 11am arrived, many of the main entree trays started being switched out. Bread trays were taken out and replaced with sushi. Pancakes were changed to herb roasted chicken. Ham was switched to Prime Rib. OMG! Was I dreaming? I had to pinch myself.

They will ask you your drink choice when you pay to get in. Order coffee! The coffee is truly amazing! It has so much character, robust but not too dark. They give you a whole carafe! Wish I could've taken that home with me. The corned beef hash during breakfast is amazing! They kept running out of this. The herb roasted chicken, mashed potatoes and wide selection of vegetables really hit the spot. After all these buffets you need some vegetables to wash down the gluttony. The desserts are incredible - creme brulee (of course), flan, fresh made dessert crepes, and chocolate croissants. Skip the sushi. I've had better sushi from Safeway and sushi doesn't belong in a French buffet.

2 hours of unlimited eating for $13.95\/person. So worth it!

They don't have a lot of fresh seafood like in other buffet - but that's not their focus and strong area.  Le Village buffet's strength is in delivering delicious, HIGH QUALITY and authentic French cuisine, and letting you try a little bit of food from each of the major regions of France.  It's a very interesting setup and the service is very good.  The waiters constantly refills my orange juice and bring us what we need.

The main reason my wife and I tried it was because of the Groupon that was available which gave us half off for the dinner buffet and unlimited drinks.  The food was good but if I'm going to pay what would have been over $100.00 for my wife and I, I expect something much tastier than good.

Let me preface this by saying their crepe station is fantastic.  The banana's foster crepe was really, really delicious so I would start at the crepe station if I were to return.  In addition that they did have crab legs and shrimp.  If you are looking for good crab legs this is not the place for you.  Some were still frozen and most were quite small.  The prime rib was good but not great.

The station that had little cast irons serving bowls was good as well.  I had the pork belly and the beef bourguignon.  Both were tasty.

As I stated the food was overall pretty good but the service was absolutely terrible.  We literally had to track down our waitress if we wanted another drink and she acted like we were pulling her teeth out when we did.

If you get the Groupon deal that gets half off the meal and drinks I think it's worth it, but just barely.  I definitely would not pay full price for the meal.  I give it three stars because of the Groupon.",0,0,0

First is the long wait because some people don't realize this place has gone down the toilet.  I could not find any tasty to eat because everything was too filthy.

How did this place get an A?  While you are in line, there is a person that comes out and tells you the wait is going to be an hour or more.  That is an exaggeration.

The food stations have many things littered along the dishes and the counter.  I can't believe that there is no one here to pick up the scraps around the dishes (probably from other customer not being able to work the tongs correctly).

Why is the seafood right next to the fresh fruit?  That doesn't sound right.  The risotto was hard.  Everything has a french twist and that's what made the food taste nasty.

This is due to failed execution.  Why does the crepe look like a diaper?  Is this highlight of the buffet the crepes or the frozen custard machine?  That was the most enjoyable dish.

Take an ice cream cone and get some frozen custard.  They can't mess that up.

Is the restaurant suppose to be filthy all over or is this how they envision what France should look like?  Are they being authenic and I just don't know it?

I like tasty good food but this place had none of that for dinnner.  I was here at 8pm.  Perhaps they ran out of food again and this was leftovers from yesterday.",0,1,0

I don't have anything to compare it to but I thought it was great. It was $27 and it is all you can eat obviously but I just don't know how you could physically eat enough to justify the $27. 
They do have SO MUCH to choose from it was a tad overwhelming. Definitely make a trip around just to look before deciding what you want. I went with a nutella crepe and it was fantastic. But who doesn't love nutella!? I also had a few other things that were also tasty. The coffee was not. Get a latte or something at the St. Louis walk up counter. Or better yet, a mimosa. It is Vegas after all! I had to go to a work conference or I would have!
We went at 7:30am on a Thursday. We had made reservations but ended up not needing them. Both evenings we were there a line was out the door. So I would suggest making a reservation through Open Table even if you end up not needing it. If you do make a reservation be sure to go to the VIP\/special entrance. If you are coming from the rooms it is on the left before the regular entrance. I don't recall my reservation telling me to do this but after we sat down our waitress told us to do that if we came back and there was a line (assuming we had made reservations of course).

I've been here several times, but my recent visit to Vegas during the summer we did the 5 Buffet of Buffets 24 hours pass for $45. Without it, price for regular brunch and dinner is $30, but for $15 more you can visit one of several different local buffets as many times as you'd like in a 24 hour period. Definitely a good deal and worth it. 

Out of all the buffets in Vegas, Le Village Buffet is truly a theme type buffet transporting guest to a French countryside, complete with cobblestone streets, sky, trees and French village. It feels more like an attraction in a Disneyland theme park without the rides and you're greeted with amazing foods from the five provinces of France (Alsace, Brittany, Burgundy, Normandy, and Provence). So hang on to your forks and spoons cause you're about to take a ride for some good grub. 

As for the food, most were delicious, good quality and prepared fresh. When doing the 24hr deal, best time to come here is during breakfast or lunch. Since Caesar's Bacchanal was closed for remodeling, we ended up here (saved Rio for dinner). My favorite dishes and suggestions include:

Cream brûlée - Nice crisp texture from carmelize sugar and sweet creamy custard so wonderfully good. 
Salads - standards selection and basic dressings - Ok
Pistachio lemon macarons - tasty, more like cookies. I prefer Lettes thou.
Brie Mac N Cheese - savory, good firm texture (not creamy or mushy) and good.
Flan - sweet custard and okay (better off having cream brulee).
Bananas Foster - okay (better at Planet Hollywood - Spice Market Buffet)
Churros - okay (even Costco taste better)
Breakfast sausage, bacon, pancakes and french toast - standard, decent and okay.
Duck confit - savory and delicious (anything cooked in its own fat is always good).
Tiramisu - Ok (better at Rio).
Fresh Made Crepes - Stuffed banana, nutella, and hazelnut, strawberry - average and tasty. Not sure if its worth 15-20 minute wait sometimes. Bring two plates so you don't have to wait in line again.
Eggs Benedict - Good
Sushi - Ok.
Pasta with Truffles - Anything with truffles is good.
Veal, Lamb & Prime rib - tender and excellent.
Salmon - Tasty and good.
Shrimp  - Average size and comes with shell.
Mussels - Tasty and good.
Crabs legs - not pre-cracked (more work), but good.

Overall - 3.5. Service was pretty decent and attentive. Nice ambience and beautiful scenery. Waitress came by regularly to refill our drinks and clear our used plates. Cette nourriture est délicieux (Food is Delicious)!! 

Cons - Killer lines during main lunch and dinner hours. Get here early or pay extra $10 to cut in front of the line.",1,1,1

When we finally got to eat, we got the tail end of the brunch period, and they were switching the brunch food out for dinner food.  If you want to save money, come here at the end of lunch on a weekday, and eat the dinner stuff for relatively cheap.

There was a lot of expensivish food, like crab legs, bouillabaise, and various carved meats.  All of these were pretty good, although not really anything to write home about.  Unfortunately, I decided to fill up on the gnocchi, risotto, and onion soup (which were quite good) first, which didn't leave much room.

The desserts, including the crepe station, were awesome.  Probably my favorite part of the buffet.

Overall, the buffet was quite good.  Although the food wasn't spectacular, I had a lot of it, and it was definitely worth the $25 or so that I spent.  Also, brunch on weekends includes champagne.

Buffet food, no matter how tasty it is, is still buffet food.  The food at Le Village may have been good, but in piling a random assortment of foods on my plate everything got mixed up--salmon leek sauce mixed with crab juices mixed with creamed spinach mixed with pork=gross.  I ended up eating mostly crab with melted butter.  

Also, I was not that impressed with the desert selection.  I missed out on the crepes (the line was long and I was in a hurry to get to a show), but the cherry tart I had was boring and tasted very doughy.

I'm so disappointed in this place.  Bad food, bad service, high prices.  How can it get worse?

I figured with all the good things I heard about their brunch, if I chose my items carefully, I could turn this 3.5 star rated place into a 4 star experience -- so wrong.

When over-done prime rib and dry turkey are what ""save"" a place, that speaks to how bad everything else was.  To make matters worse, very poor, rude service at the cashier --  felt like a stereotypical Chinese restaurant, killing the Paris escapism. And I'm Chinese!

$25 for my 13 year old daughter who ate half a crepe?  

Here's a rundown of the foods sampled:

- prime rib - unevenly cooked, but mostly grey over done.

- turkey - bone dry, the gravy was solidified and chunky so I didn't use it.

- mussels\/clams - flavorless

- pastas - bland, dry, room temp

- fruits - not sweet, watery, flavorless

- bread - stale

- pate - big clunky pieces, no finesse 

- cheeses - ditto

- orange juice - like tang

I honestly can't understand why anyone would like this place.  Are they so excited to be in Vegas they overlook quality?  First time at a buffet?  Because they have a crepe station?  This place makes Hometown Buffet feel special.

I REALLY hate wasting food and would always make an effort to finish something, even if I don't care for it.  But sadly on this day, we wasted quite a bit of food.

I feel so violated.

First off, for 4 people to eat I spent a little over $100. And let me tell you, it wasn't worth the money or the wait.

The food is such poor quality, and they cook way too much of it. Don't get me wrong, I know it's a Buffet, but if it's 12 pm and there's still a whole tub of bacon and waffles still sitting there from this morning, then something's wrong. And like i said, it's just way too much things they make, yet it's so tasteless and not the best quality. 

The salmon lox tasted obviously like it's been frozen and defrosted. It didn't taste fresh. The cream cheese they used on the side wasn't even good too. It wouldn't go on the plate and it was stuck to the serving spoon. And something about the texture of it didn't seem right. 

The croissants tasted obviously store bought. They were stale, not flaky, and chewy. Also not buttery, almost like eating regular chewy old bread. 

The rice they had there was also undercooked. It was also a little watery and lacked flavor. Very disappointed by that.

The cheese and salami was pretty bad too. The salami tasted like the salami out of a lunchables pack and the cheese wasn't very good quality either and not fresh.

Although, the prime rib was actually pretty good. I didn't have a problem with it. Also since I saw them make it and how they make it, It was pretty nice.

But other than that it the good was disappointing. Sausages were flavorless and mashed potatoes were flavorless too. The country gravy was awful and just super chunky. And it didn't taste very good.

Overall my experience here was pretty bad. The service was pretty nice and the servers were friendly and helpful. But the food is just straight out pretty horrible. Would I come here again? Obviously not. If you're looking for a nice buffet in Vegas, this is obviously not your go to destination. There's much better out there in Vegas trust me.",0,0,0

At 9am on a Wednesday, this place was crackin'.  I waited in line about 40 minutes to be seated.  

I loved the ambience of this buffet.  It is decorated to look like you've walked into a French marketplace.  Each of the buffet stations is named after a region in France.  There was a selection of breads, all different variations of eggs (scrambled with sausage, scrambled with mushroom, etc.), ham, sausage, bacon, french toast, pastries different variations of potatoes, as well as made to order omelettes and crepes.  I also noticed that they had a yogurt bar with granola, raisins and nuts to mix in.  Plain, undressed salad and fresh sliced fruit were also available.

As I had an appointment at the spa, I ate ""light."" I got a custom omelette, hash browns and a dessert crepe that came with a bananas foster style filled crepe with nutella\/just chocolate sauce drizzled on top with the freshest whipped cream ever!  Although there was a decent selection of breakfast foods, the cooks at Le Village never skimped on quality, which really impressed me.  This led to us deciding to eat a dinner meal here as well.

For dinner, there were not a ton of vegetarian friendly options.  There were tons of meats available (chicken, duck, beef, lamb, crab legs) and dishes containing meat.  Same great bread selection and the expected salad bar fixings.  The french onion soup seemed popular.  However, after experiencing a great dessert crepe at breakfast, I went straight for the savory caprese crepe at dinner and didn't regret it.  The balsamic reduction was delish!  I also tried the sweet potato, mashed potatoes and gratin potatoes.  All were tasty.  

The dessert included many sugar free pastries as well as sugar-full desserts.  Eclairs, creme brulee, walnut brownies and fruit tarts all looked good, but I didn't go for them.  I settled with the chocolate custard and was pleased.  

Overall, great quality and selection on breakfast and dinner.  Definitely worth it to do the buffet of buffets as weekday breakfast was priced at $18.99 and weekday dinner was priced at $30.99.  I paid $44.99 for the 24 hour Buffet of Buffet pass.",1,0,1

I'm not a gambler but I did find some things to enjoy. This buffet had a few negative reviews, mostly centered around peoples' expectations or their service. Well, I figured out the secret - if you have a large group, reserve ahead of time on Open Table (at least a day or so).  I came solo on a business trip, had no wait, and fantastic service. I overheard the waitstaff talking and the area I was seated in is referred to as VIP - reason being, I tipped and was polite. 

Food wise, there are some fantastic options. My favorites were the truffle oil Mac and cheese, the fresh roast beef, stuffed lamb, and the sautéed mushrooms. They have crab legs, but they are cold and I didn't see a means to warm them on the buffet itself.

They had iced opened crab legs, mussels, clams, cocktail shrimp at the seafood section.  I regret eating ice cold clams first thing in the morning because it made my tummy not feel very good. 

The meat selection here is pretty good, asides from the prime rib, turkey, and ham they also have lamb chops, and tri tip.  The tri tip steak was surprisingly tender! 

The eggs benedict here are really good!! I just wish they came out  more often because they disappeared pretty fast.  They also had an omelette station & crepe station here.  The crepes were really good, and even though the line looked really long, the guy made the crepes pretty fast. 

They did not have alot of selection at this buffet, the strawberries were kind of sour. 

They did not have watermelon either. 

The only dessert I liked was the creme brulee, caramel custard, and the vanilla custard\/ice cream thing.  The rest of the desserts looked unappetizing.  I hate the lighting in this buffet, it is so dark and makes the restaurant look outdated.

I would at least expect there to be more lunch options versus breakfast... They got some good soups (potato leek and creamy chicken), nice ""french"" breads and bagels, some fancy cheese options.

Dessert was kind of a let down. No gelato. They only had a cheap ice cream machine with the usual chocolate and vanilla flavors. They do however have macaroons (yes...they advertise that like crazy), parents enjoyed the caramel brulee and the lemon cream pie.

First of all, if you dine here for breakfast, you must try the crepes.  I got a berry-filled crepe with raspberry coulis and it was one of the top crepes I've had.  The only issue with this station is that they really stick to their menu and don't customize your choice.  So you're pretty much out of luck if you wanted to add some bananas to your berry crepe.

First off, they started charging $12 for beverages (OK, I'll take some responsibility for that one). Still a pretty reasonable price.

The food was always every French dish you could think of from Alsatian sausages and cassoulet to salads nicoise from Provence, it was all there.

The food here is good, although a few dishes were misses. They do have a section of some Mediterranean flavors and some sushi rolls. I saw a grill where they were cooking chicken and other meats but did not have anything from that station.

This is a mostly French buffet, portions are small, stations are small, hopefully you will sit in the open dining room, if you get stuck in the back room like we did it loses the atmosphere effect because the rooms are small and lots of screaming babies. 

It's not like Mirage or Wynn, so keep that in mind if you're expecting to put a slice of pizza, a taco and roast beef on your plate, this is not that type of buffet.

Duck a la Orange (yummy), 
Roast beef
Crab Legs (they were always out)
Shrimp (on the shell)
Chicken Coq au Vin (good), 
Seafood Bouillabaisse, 
Scalloped potatoes (which were not great),

I'm still not big into buffets, but I'll give my review. 

$24 for the buffet and $11 for bottomless drinks. If you gamble, just save the $11 and go sit at a table or slots. You'll have a couple of mediocre drinks and be on your way. Plus, we waited in line for 15-20 minutes so you tend to want to eat and go about your day. 

You've got food from all over the world. This is their theme or attractiveness. I had nothing that surprised me with pleasantness. 

I'd recommend getting small portions at each station so you can taste a variety. My friend didn't do this and ended up having one tall hodgepodge of a plate. Plus, you might as well taste it all incase something does entice your tastebuds. 

The seafood is supremely overcooked. The mussels had the consistency of smoked oysters. The clams were stuck like chuck to the shell and if you pry them out, you'll end up chewing some shell. Woof. 

The meat was tough and dry. And overcooked. 

Get some cocktail shrimp. That's a safe good thing. 

There was a station that was savoit (something like that, sorry), and the veggies were ok. There was a tomato salad that was also very ok. It could have used more reduced balsamic reduction.

The buffets in Vegas have been heading in the same direction over the past five years - more expensive, while less quality. I've seen this happen at Rio, Wynn and now Paris. I lived in Vegas for three years and worked as a supervisor in one of the largest casinos there; as a frequent visitor to buffets, I can say this isn't simply speculation; it's what's gone down.

Le Buffet when it opened, was one of the finest in Vegas; a fantastic assortment of food stations, incredible service and desserts to die for. When we returned to this buffet in January, I was so disappointed, I felt sick all night that we'd payed about $70 for two of us to eat here.

The buffet caters primarily toward seafood now, which is great if you're a seafood lover; I am not. There were very few options that were appealing for non-seafood fans. There is a generous mountain of shrimp to mine from and there are crab legs; I do like shellfish. However, whenever the crab legs are put out, unless you're camping there, you're going to get completely raped by the pushy folks that get there before you and blast through the pile, diligently picking it clean of the good legs, leaving the spoils to everyone else. It was frustrating and annoying as hell.

The food selections I did have were okay - but definitely not worth $30 or so per person. The dessert station was a disaster; names of desserts did NOT match what was out. Obviously, the staff here doesn't care. It was a ""try your luck"" situation and patrons were left to guess what treat they were actually getting.

At one station, I couldn't separate two bowls, and I passed them toward a staff member on the other side of the counter, telling her they were stuck. She looked at me like I was an idiot and slammed the bowls on the granite counter, which made them separate. She gave me one, and started putting the other BACK INTO THE CLEAN BOWLS PILE, after I'd explained to her that I gave them to her because my hands were all over them. A woman standing next to me spoke right up and asked the staffer what she was thinking; that I'd JUST told her I was touching the bowls! The staff member frowned at the other customer and removed the bowl from the stack. Totally disgusting; makes you wonder what else ends up in the clean plates stacks there.

Table clearing was slow and finding someone to refill our soda was a joke. Total contrast to when this buffet was new and it seemed that there were several bussers for each table that were on you like vultures the minute you cleaned your plate or put an empty glass on the table. Not the case anymore, sadly, and that added to my frustration.

Standing in line for another station, the final straw broke this camel's back - a woman stood in front of me eating food off of her plate and SUCKING her fingers. Then, you guessed it, she went right on using that hand to use tongs and spoons getting more food from the buffet.

And really, that's the core problem with ANY buffet. People are disgusting. They are piggish and pushy and dirty. You can somewhat control the level of a dining experience, but you can never completely control the other customers. Case in point, The Wicked Spoon at Cosmopolitan - considered to be the best buffet in Vegas now by many. We ate there and the experience was okay - except for the two tables close to us with loud, drunk douchebag guests being SO loud that it disrupted everyone's experience.

So the next time you consider shelling out the better part of $100 on a Vegas buffet, remember what you're paying for - crowds of strangers pawing at the same spoons and tongs, breathing and coughing over the same food stations and a wait staff that is there making just over minimum wage that honestly won't give a rat's ass if you ever return or not.

In my opinion, they have strange food and when I walked around to fill up my first plate of food; I struggled to find anything that caught my eye. I guess the type of food that they offer is very french\/European and not very mainstream. Also the King Crab legs here are very tinsy winsy compared to some of the more popular places in Vegas. When I spotted another table with larger crab legs that I managed to obtain, I asked my waiter. He replied that they have some kind of high rollers card, and it turns out that Paris only serve larger Crab legs to people who gamble a lot. Go figure!..

When we were leaving, however, the line was twice as long, so come earlier if you can't wait to eat!  It was definitely worth it, and next time, I would wait longer if needed!  

If youre looking for a fancy place, this isn't it.  I thought of it more as a family-friendly, down to earth type of place.  The decor is nice, very european (it IS in the Paris hotel, haha).  It kinda reminded me of Busch Gardens Europe (in Va).  I really liked the selection of breakfast food here.  They had all the breakfast staples - my favorite breakfast item was the made-to-order omlets - I recommend this instead of getting the pre-made scrambled eggs to save room in your stomach!  Since we came relatively early, we didn't have to wait in a long line at the stations, either, which I read in other reviews, except the crepes\/waffles station looked a little long so I didn't try it.  They had silver dollar pancakes that had been sitting a little while, so mine were hard as a rock- one of the only down sides to this buffet, which you may not find if you come here.  They had a nice selection of cheese, pate (if youre into it), salmon, oatmeal, cream of wheat, fresh breads, fresh fruit, churros, they had pretty much everything.  The dessert station wasn't very extravagant, I guess since it was breakfast, understandable.  I can't remember exactly but I think they had cookies, banana chips, scones, etc.  There was a lady inside the dessert station torching creme brulee which was probably for dinner since she didn't put any out.  We did end up having the chocolate and vanilla soft-serve custard, which oddly enough, was fabulous for an after-breakfast dessert :)  

As far as the service goes, our waitress was a little slow, I think since it was so busy there as we were about to leave.  You pay up front before you get inside, juice is included in the price plus another drink of your choice.

I think it's a unique buffet with the French spin giving it a little different feel than others.  What I really like there is the crepe station.  I always get the mushroom crepe and it's delicious, but I have trouble eating anything big at a buffet so I always end up wasting it.  I need someone with me who also likes mushrooms!  I also love the cheese selection, although I thought the selection during this most recent  visit was a little too ""American""... where was the brie?  I like unusual cheeses so would have liked more of that.  I kind of filled up on little salads and cheese and the crepe, but then of course, headed to the carving station for some Prime Rib and accompanied that with some cavatappi with cream and truffle and a couple types of roasted potatoes.  I was a little disappointed with the Prime Rib as it was a little overcooked... no pink to be seen, but it was still moist and fairly tender, so that was something.  Had trouble tracking down condiments and condiment containers which is a little frustrating, but the breads were yummy.

The worst part of the food is the desserts.  They are pretty weak unless you love macaroons, but they do sweet crepes at the crepe station, so if you still have room, that's a great option.

We got lucky on this visit and walked right into the main line without being in any switchbacks, yet it still took us a good 30 minutes before we got seated and they had a the whole back overflow area completely empty!  After we got in line, the switchbacks behind us filled up so on Monday night, apparently 7:15 is the time to arrive!  

We were offered a complimentary glass of wine, which was cool, but we stuck to our sodas and other than that our waitress wasn't all that.  So service here was ""meh"", but we enjoyed our meal and I will go back.

The only thing I wanted at this buffet was the creme brulee. I've been to this buffet THREe times and have always gotten their creme brulee because it's freaking DELICIOUS.

Well I think it ALSO means that they stop cooking at 10 because when I went up to the dessert island to get my creme brulee, they were OUT and not making anymore.

UM NO. If my family is gonna pay 25+ dollars per person, you BETTER have some freaking creme brulee because it's the best dessert on your dessert island. Don't let people into your buffet if you are going to run out of food. You are a BUFFET so you should continue making your food, even if you are closing.

Not horrible but nothing here that I would order off a menu. Too expensive for breakfast given the lack of quality. The eggs Benedict were over poached to the point of hard boil stage.

Not worth a special trip.  You're better off ordering something you really like and made to order at a decent breakfast place.

Ugh. I had high hopes for this one, but was completely let down. The reoccurring theme was dry: pork, roast beef, tri-tip, duck -- all dry, and scarily enough, all tasted vaguely the same! Prime rib looked way better than it tasted.

Run away from the truffle macaroni-- it is evil incarnate and stunk like funky garbage. Totally pungent nastiness.

The majority of other items I tried tasted uninspired, as if cooked with total apathy--like tone deaf cooking. Sauces were questionable and bland. Coq au Vin sauce  tasted like vinegar, not ""vin""!!

1 star for the service-- staff were friendly and helpful, which I certainly appreciate. Also, the crepes and crab were good, but its pretty hard to screw that up, right?

Yes, the village ambiance is quaint and cute, but without decent food to back it up, it's just a gimmick.

We picked it because we heard good things about it and it was cheaper than some of the other higher end buffets. When we got there, we noticed we can get a discount if we were a Total Rewards member, so we joined. It was like $1 off, but the membership was free so why not? You need to go to the casino to sign up though. 

The line was not that long, but it took a while to get through. I think they were waiting for tables to open up so we could be seated. It took a while to be seated too. 

The ambiance of the buffet was like no other though and probably my favorite part about it. I love how Vegas portraits different parts of the world and they did a good job at Paris hotel and this buffet. The buffet represented the 5 provinces of France and had some foods that are representative from each province. 

The food was good, but not great. I enjoyed the hot meats, crab legs, and especially the desserts. Some meat was over cooked so it was a little tough and the sushi they had did not look fresh so I stayed away from that. The desserts were my favorite part. They had macrons, cookies, cakes, creme brulee, etc.

We went for breakfast\/lunch at 11 am.  We got in about 40 minutes later and stayed until 1 pm.  I really enjoyed the variety of foods here, especially the large selection of desserts.

I went directly first to the crepe line, since I know it's popular.  It was pretty good, but very sweet.  You get to pick what goes in your crepe, and I chose blueberries, strawberries, and banana.  Only the banana was fresh.  The berries were just preserves.  Someone asked if they had fresh berries\/fruit, and the lady (1 lady making tons of crepes for everyone in line), said they hadn't had fresh fruit in a while. 

I then went over and looked at the desserts and got an omelet made.  It was a standard omelet with nothing exciting, though the guy who made our omelets was really friendly.

I LOVE seafood and was very pleasantly pleased to find a lox (cream cheese and smoked salmon on a bagel) station.  There were bagels, cream cheese, smoked salmon, and capers.  I loaded my plate and really enjoyed my lox more than anything else.  I wish I had room to eat more of it, but I sadly discovered this station at the end.

I thought it was pretty cool that they also had a little Mediterranean station.  I was too full by then to try anything from there.  And by about noon, I saw people started stacking their plates with crab legs for lunch. Not sure if they had those out earlier, but I sure didn't notice people with them during my first round.  I stuck to the breakfast stuff, since I could only get that once a day.  

I don't know why, but I really liked this place a lot.  The food wasn't super unique, but the people who served at the stations were really nice.  I also loved the ambiance.  Some buffets look super old and outdated.  This one was nice and felt more cozy.  Though it's not Paris, it did remind me a lot of my visit to Paris (which may also be why I liked this place).

Well... those are nothing more than illusions of grandeur and definitely the failures of romanticizing about the past. 

I came here alone for breakfast when my friends were all sleeping and recovering from our nighttime adventures. I remember it was really cheap, about $20-something for the breakfast buffet. The people were very nice and accommodating... 

BUT THE FOOD!!!!! 

Bleh, the plate I grabbed was so horrible I had to cut up and re-arrange the food on my plate to make it look like I actually touched it so the lady would take it away. 

I liked their eggs florentine, the ham the grapefruit, the fruits and the orange juice... but quiche was too oily, the selection of scrambled eggs were disappointing and the steak and potatoes were overcooked. The crepe was ""okay"" but the bananas were too soggy, I just brushed it aside and ate the outside part with the nutella. I didn't even want to eat the breakfast pastries... it was just chocolate croissants, muffins, danish, cinnabuns, etc... nothing special or out of the ordinary...

Yes, there usually is a line, but it is well worth it. Once they seat you, you are faced with one of the most difficult decisions of the trip...which food station to hit up first?? I recommend the crepe station, but do your best to save room because there's a lot more deliciousness to try. The meats I tried (prime rib, roasted chicken and pork sausage) were tender, savory and tasty enough to eat as a stand alone dish. The scrambled eggs must have had some kind of crack because both my wife and I were thinking of ways to smuggle some out in our pockets. Seriously, DELISH. I also enjoyed the variety of their fresh fruit. The chicken noodle soup was the lone non-plus morsel that touched my mouth. Lastly, the desserts...I'm not a big dessert guy, but I did love their chocolate chip cookies. That's not saying much but my wife (who is a big dessert person) could have had her whole meal be just the desserts!

All this incredible food and I haven't even mentioned the staff. They were all friendly and speedy with their service. Our dirty plates were quickly picked-up and our drinks were never empty. I also have to make a special shout-out to their Chef...Chef Lowell McCain was AMAZING! He answered all of our questions and even took the time to show my pregnant wife the packaging on a variety of their cheeses, to assure her of the pasteurization.

As all of you know I like to get the negative details out of the way first before I talk about how much I love a place so: The line was ridiculous. Granted, I did go on Christmas day (and I thought by doing this I would actually BEAT the crowd. The reason I went out on Christmas instead of staying home was because I wanted to do something different. I always thought most people still prefer to stay at home during the holidays?), but it's really hard for me to say the wait was worth it if the line is almost 3 hours long and I'm not even exactly hungry anymore. Also, this is quite possibly the worst layout of a buffet I have ever seen. There's no obvious exit, most of the tables are placed way too closely to the buffet stations and there's barely any space to maneuver from station to station in the buffet. I really don't think I have ever felt more claustrophobic.

There, done griping. Anyways this is one of the best buffets I have ever been to. Not gonna lie, when I first looked through the buffet before picking out my food I thought it was going to be disappointing due to the lack of diversity because I'm still kind of under the impression that a buffet is only good if there's loads and loads of international variety. (Unless we're talking about the neighborhood Chinese buffet) I'm accustomed to buffets offering stations for Chinese, Mexican, Sushi, Italian, etc.... so I was really thrown off when I saw this buffet was set up more like a French grocery store. However, once I made myself a plate, I realized that the food was of very good quality. This was basically my introduction to French food, and it's good to see that the legend about French cooking being essentially small pieces of meat swimming in fancy sauces isn't true. There also are some international options if you look (for example, in the grill (or is it rotisserie?) section there's pita bread and hummus next to the beef and lamb slices, so there you go, you can make yourself a gyro). Word of advice: This is definitely not a place to take a vegetarian. I mean, of course the typical buffet is hell for any non-meat eater but other than 2 or 3 big bowls of salad and bread there's pretty much nothing here. 

I also fell in love with the crepe section. This was actually my first time having ever eaten a crepe, I've been wanting to try one for a really long time but never seem to get around to it (and it's somewhat hard to find a place that makes them in Vegas to begin with) and it was SO good. I got a strawberry filled one with powdered sugar and caramel syrup on top. I so would have grabbed another one if I didn't mind feeling like a masochist, but alas, I'm getting more self-conscious about my weight these days. Oh well. 

So basically this is not a buffet to go to if you're looking for variety in a non-specific sense, but it's a very high quality one regardless, I'll go as far to say it's even better than the Bellagio, and at regular price it's about $15 less. I would go here again just for the crepes. Just remember to get here shortly before or right after each meal has begun and definitely don't go during a really busy time such as a holiday or else you will practically have to get in line on the bridge to Bally's.",0,0,0

I could have gotten over this if it weren't for the crepe station. I love going to the Creperie they have across from the buffet, and since they offer the same crepes in the buffet you'd assume they would be the same quality. You'd be wrong.

When we were finally seated, the service was great! Our server was super sweet and brought our drinks over and picked up our plates in a timely fashion. This made up for lack of service at the beginning.

The king crab legs, mussels, and truffled pasta are the top three things to get at this buffet. Along with the eclairs and creme brûlée for dessert, you're set for a looooong food coma! 

Otherwise, the rest of the food isn't anything special, though they do have a crepe station which has an extensive menu- sweet and savory options.

Le Village, a bit of a walk in past the casinos and easily identifiable by its long lines, has great menus. We came here just between the brunch\/dinner transition on Saturday, and found ourselves enjoying unlimited crepes (2 at a time though), bottomless mimosas, and creme brulees galore. Oh yeah, and the prime rib, and the cod (mmm), and the salmon, and the crab, and the...yeah. There's some things that aren't that great but fill yourself up on the good things and it'll be well worth your $32 (Saturday brunch\/dinner price) and you'll be raving about it afterwards.

Being that Vegas has brought(or stolen) pieces from around the world and placed them in one city, I figured the food would have a large French influence with a dash of American on top.

What was good? The ratatouille was not bad. The creme brulee had a nice caramelized shell ontop and a small sized serving. The prime rib and king crab were good like any other buffet would have it. But of all things I loved the shwarma. It was in the corner and all the stuff was separate, but I got the pita bread and filled it up with the hummus, lamb, roasted eggplant and some other stuff too.  It wasn't the freshest, since not many people were eating from there, but I loved it. The had chicken and beef too, but I really wished they had falafel.

Sad food? The french onion soup was just sitting there, and I had to move over to sprinkle the croutons on, and the thick slices of assorted cheese was on the other side. In addition, the soup wasn't hot enough to meal the cheese.  It wasn't very tasty... A lot of the meat was really dry or bland.  I tried the canard de l'orange, but it just tasted like regular roasted duck. They had sushi... I didn't care for that.. at a french buffet? com'on. There were some different fish pieces that were bland, but i didn't know what to accompany it with due to how all the food was organized.  I tried a macaroon, and it was not made traditionally.  They stacked it incorrectly, it tasted more like bread than caramelized sugar, and the had some type of almond shavings on top to make it crunchy. And last of all.... the crepe.. sooo sad.... I saw the people before me get theirs and I saw how goopy it was, so I asked if I could have mine extra crispy.  I had nutella, bananas, whipped cream, and I also wanted apricots. However, she gave me a look and asked if I was sure as if I was crazy.  She put it on the side for me, instead and when I sat down to take a bite, still soggy. So soggy that my crepe had burst open...sigh

I was grossed out just by thinking of how many hours those salads have been sitting out there. It was completely abandoned (the dim lighting didn't help). The baked desserts reportedly had the same problem as the salad bar (stale). 

Although, others in my party seemed to enjoy the seafood options & crepe bar! I can say the food they kept hot was good such as their roasted vegetables and pastas.

The service was extremely slow, the hardest part of the meal was hunting someone down for new utensils or a cup of water.

My first visit to Paris buffet was for the Sunday brunch, which my group waited almost two hours for. We spent most of that time standing, sitting on the floor and leaning on walls as we needed to. When we all were seated, we ran for our first rounds and devoured our food, drinking unlimited mimosas as we went along. Between the first and second rounds a MOTHER EFFING CURTAIN ROD fell from the wall above us, swung down and almost knocked the life out of my friend (whose skull was spared because I motioned him closer to say something at the very instant the rod came crashing down). 

Meal refunds, a switch from unlimited mimomas to straight up champagne (which our server kept pouring), three rounds of food, and a year later, WE WENT BACK. 

It's THAT good. 

Granted, after the whole curtain rod debacle, we were terrified to be seated in one of the ""indoor"" areas, but the food drew us back in. The meats are cooked really well and are good quality- so are all the other hot dishes. The bread selection is exceptional, which is to be expected of a french buffet. I wish I could've had more of the dinner options, but was out there was great (just can't remember what I had). Lastly, the dessert and crepes lent to making it one of the better buffets for sweets (this coming from a person who hates most buffet desserts).

Le Village Buffet offers a wide variety of French inspired dishes that are freshly cooked with very little in cost over the average resort buffet. They had everything from fresh crab legs to a vegetarian bar (which, although I am not a vegetarian, had a great selection!) The prime rib was five star for a buffet style restaurant. 

The minor reasons I gave this buffet a 4 and not a 5 was for the following reasons; There was a severe lack of claw crackers or tiny forks for the crab legs\/claws, which just seems sadistic given the freshness of the meat. They appeared to be seating 'non-diamond' customers in a separate room, alway from the actual buffet. I don't have a problem with preferred customers getting faster seats or discounts, I just felt like I was in some sort of containment camp for poor people. And the sushi was just average, if your going to serve sushi, serve it right. The rolls were boring (cucumber & california) and I couldn't find a small cup or dish for soy sauce, which means I would just have to pour it over the rolls and that is just wrong!

I will say, however, that of the 4 buffets I visited in Vegas on my last trip (Wynn, Bellagio, Aria being the other 3), it was 4th in line.  It just didn't stack up to the last 2 times I was there.  It's slipped a bit, to be honest.

The food choices overall was a bit skimpy compared to other lunch buffets (Aria, Mandalay, etc).  It's the only buffet I visited where it was pretty easy to get through all the choices and fill up your plate twice (or even once).  The choices just weren't as appealing.

The food also didn't appear that fresh (sorta warmed over looking).  That was odd to me b\/c we were there on as Monday and fairly early (about 1130) so it's not like more than a few dozen ppl had even been through it.  The food was a bit ""dry"" in spots.  

The positives were that overall, you'll leave full and fairly satisfied with the meat and other selections.  My wife really liked the sole very much! Also, the decor if you sit ""outside"", is pretty cool (although the painted ""cloud"" ceilings is overdone between Venetian, Planet Hollywood and the Paris- everyone does it and it's starting to look 90's, hokey and dated).  The crepe station I didn't take advantage of (just not my thing), although if you are into that, it did look pretty apealing.

We were seated in the back, and our drink orders were taken. Sodas, juices, and coffee is unlimited. The buffet area does look very Disneyland-esque as others had mentioned. Selections varied from salads, meats, French inspired food, and of course, the crepe station. 

Was really dissapointed that there wasn't a vast array of cheeses and breads as I had expected, although towards the end of our stay, they did put out some cheeses, but they were very typical kinds. Most of their food was not flavorful, and choices were limited. My favorite was the ham and cheese quiche, but it was comparable to the frozen ones you can find at Costco. Saved room for the crepes, and they have about 4 sweet choices and 4 savory. The line is usually long and we waited about 20 minutes. Luckily you can choose up to 2, and they make it really quick. 

I seemed to have gotten the crepe maker that didn't really care as I could see him burning the crepes and not paying attention. My sweet crepe had candied walnuts, and my savory had spinach, mushrooms, etc. Can't remember all the ingredients, and he must've forgotten as instead of bechamel, he poured powdered sugar all over the top and had to make it all over again. Both were not memorable at all. 

Overall, we all agreed this place is whatevers, and wouldn't return.",4,1,1

The food quality and selection is poor comparing to many others I've visited during this trip, and some were already being out for too long and cold, for example the grilled zucchini and grilled mushrooms.

Good food, good service, and a wonderful theme (it's Paris, of course it looks beautiful). Unfortunately, it seems to have gone average with some of the service. More so unfortunate because we came here for my brother's 18th bday dinner and were treated quite poorly. 

The food was still pretty good so I can't complain too much there. Large selection and variety of meats, pastas, seafood, salads, dessert (yes they have creme brûlée and macarons!), and a bar if you'd like alcoholic drinks as well. While Certain items were super flavorful, others were on the bland side-you can't have it all. 

The downside: The service was...underwhelming.  We did see our server to refill our drinks a couple times, however, he was so rushed we could barely understand what he was saying. Of course, we still smiled and said thank you. He was definitely hard to track down and whenever we did need refills, it took a while to find him and an even harder time to get him to come over. (Our table was in an awkward spot, so I understand that, but it Seemed that way for the other tables around us as well). Of course we didn't need too much from our waiter seeing as it is a Buffet, but after this birthday fiasco, I had a hard time wanting to leave a t


If you'd like to read more of a personal story of what happened, Let me explain: I understand buffets don't really do anything too special for birthdays, but I asked my server if he had a candle and he quickly walked away rudely saying, no we don't have anymore. To me that means that you did...but you're too lazy to ask for any. So...I asked a different lady up front and go figure, she had a bunch of colored candles and said my server should've had some, is supposed to bring us the candle and light it. (She also said he would sing...but it's fine. We can do that ourselves). 
Our server comes back and is shocked I have a candle sitting on top of one of the desserts. I ask him for a lighter and he just says, no I don't have one. I quickly explain that that's fine, but the lady up front told me to ask my server. He responds rudely with: ""well I don't, so What do you want me to do?""

Wow. First off, don't give me attitude. Next, it would be nice if you could find the answer, or see if someone else has one. Three, I DID get a lighter from the same ladies up front. Not sure if it's a server issue or if they don't have very good communication within the buffet. Needless to say, our waiter never showed up at our table after that and, of course, Did not bring us the tea we ordered more than 10 minutes before this. 

Got to talk to a manager up front, but Not entirely sure if I'll be back after the night we had.

The cashier had no sign of any enthusiasm. As if she was ready to go home at 4 pm. Then the host who was in charge to give us a table even lacked more customer service. She was on the phone talking to her family- I'm like really? Aren't you on the clock? As if she was on her break. The server who helped us was nice and very attentive. She knew when to ask us for beverage, water or coffee.  Let's talk about the crepe station. That guy looked like he did not want to be there to begin with. The cold section where the seafood was, smelled like nasty sewer. They did not fill what was out, and the floor on that station looked like as if you were in the wet market.

I would like to compliment the guys who worked in the steak section. They were very kind and friendly. They had all the enthusiasm in the world that 65 % of the crew did not have. The prime rib is BOMB! It goes well with that french gravy! I think i's called Burgundy sauce. Top it off with mushroom and side of the rice pilaf (the one with butter) and woaaallah! Dinner is served! You have to try the macaroni and cheese- another bomb.com! There were 2 types of rice pilaf, and both were yummy! And last but not the least; the dessert. Creme Bulee, Flan and etc. There were lots of delicious treats to go for. Don't forget the crepe. You can add stuff to your crepe right on your own table like, the flan and some chocolate from the dessert station. 

I have to say I really like this buffet but, change is definitely a must! The atmosphere with the workers looked like there were tension among the diversity of the race. As if they were not happy to work there. They did not want to work together as a team and just wanted to mind their own business. The guys in the steak section- they need to take a page from their book. They knew what great customer service was, and they looked like they enjoy what they do.

If you are charging this kind of money, you better have mouth watering prime rib and roast beef to start. Also, some of the side dishes were bland and uninspired. Yes, there was alot to choose from and the atmosphere was nice but for the price they are charging, they need to do more. The highlight of the meal was dessert. Creme Brulee was out of this world as were some of the pastries. The Crepe station knocked it out of the park. It was just sooo good. But the highlight of a pricey meal should not be dessert.

We went for lunch, which was $24.99\/person, not including tip. I am not sure what other Vegas buffets offer, but overhearing one table over, they were surprised that this buffet did not include a glass of wine. Soda and soft drinks were included (Pepsi products). At lunchtime the buffet wasn't that crowded and we were seated at a table in the main section near the dessert area. Our waitress was friendly and did a good job of keeping up with clearing plates. 

The buffet had the usual staples - shrimp, a carving station with prime rib, ham, and turkey. They also had an extensive salad bar area that also contained various types of soups and fresh fruit. One of my favorite dishes was truffle pasta. There also was roasted chicken that was quite tasty that I went back for on one of my many trips back up to the buffet after my friend recommended it.

I enjoyed the crepe station that the buffet had and got a delicious strawberry and nutella crepe. The menu also had other interesting crepe flavor combinations that looked good as well. One of my favorite desserts were the macarons and there were plenty of flavors to pick from.

The seaweed salad was tasty, but the sushi was lackluster. They didn't have any chopsticks, either, which is odd for serving that kind of food. The cheddar cheese was very good, and the havarti was decent. The beef tips were tender and juicy, a good choice. The pork belly with apples was also a win. I was very happy to find a variety of vegetables because I bought the Buffet of Buffets pass, so this was the third buffet I had been to in that time period, and the vegetable options had seemed to be limited at some of the other buffets.

The Seating: They seated us in a small room where you couldn't enjoy much of the Parisian atmosphere that was the main reason we wanted to try Le Village. I asked the waiter if we could move to one of the small empty tables and he actually started laughing. It was very unprofessional. 

So I asked a manager if we could have one of the empty tables for two rather than the one for four that we were seated at in a small room off to the side. She said no -- and that that those tables were for members of Total Rewards Platinum or whatever the higher categories are. Seriously, this is a buffet not a fancy restaurant. And there were empty tables everywhere and we had to sit in a small room where you can't see anything. We just wanted to see the Parisian themes and the buffet itself. Denied. 

The Seafood: They had crab legs but they were very salty. They were not as good as at Caesars, Bellagio, or Aria buffet. All those three others had raw oysters, and Le VIllage didn't. The shrimp at Le Village were very small and not worth the time. They did have good cooked mussels.

The chef asked me to wait a little longer for the cheese to melt inside the crepe which I thought was totally fine.  However upon indulgence, the cheese was not warm and not fully melted either.

Particularly we liked the crepe station as well as the meat carving stations. We liked it so much, we ended up having a breakfast, a lunch and a dinner at the place, which was coincidentally right below our hotel room. 

Other choice things to look out for include,
- Breakfast omelet -- tasty and made fresh. We did not even experience a long line at the station!
- Braised duck. Does more need to be said?
- Meat carving stations. Delicious, and the meat tastes as if brined so it has a wonderfully salty flavor throughout. 
- Pastas. Surprisingly, these are not a waste of time.

We thought the atmosphere, while completely fake, was charming. The restaurant is in a kind of perpetual dusk, no matter the time of day. The staff were always very nice and helpful.",0,0,0

Le Village buffet is the happiest place on earth to me as far as Vegas buffets go. We paid an arm and a leg ($55 pp if I remember correctly) at the Wynn buffet and it was a disaster.

We had the Bellagio buffet the day before and it was worse than the hometown buffet, it was worth about $10, years ago, the Bellagio was an elegant place, a buffet fit for royalties, I still remember the opulence of everything, the chicken\/beef wellington, pate, cornichons. It was outrageous there was no mayonnaise and little variety in the offerings. They had olives & weir cheese in everything.

 Paris hotel, Le Village buffet had my favorite pate de campagne with cornichons! they even had chicken pate, it was so yummy, aioli to kill for. Their onion soup was always good but not this time, it was thick and tasted like it came out of a can. They had a real grill where fresh beef tritip was grilled in front of your eyes, chicken, sausages, hummus, fresh grilled veggies, French bread and pita pockets were also available.

Cuisine of 5 regions of France were represented. They had a crepe station where fresh crepes were made to order, I did not want to wait so I skipped it this time. I like the bouillabaisse but this time, there were no fish or scallops, only mussels and clams.

The shrimp cocktail was very good here, Bellagio cocktail sauce was not edible, too sweet and just tasted bad.

I was so stuffed, I was not able to eat much desert, I did have a flan, it was good but not enough caramel taste, no other restaurant I have been to have caramel sauce, If I want it, I would have to make it myself or go to Paris, it simply vanished from the US.

I don't understand the complaint of some reviewers, this is a French buffet if you want ham and turkey, you come to the wrong place!. Years ago, there were a few European chefs, now all the chefs\/cooks were Hispanic plus the desire to save money, the buffet had been dumbed down just like on cruise ships, you cannot expect authentic cuisine under these circumstances. That said, this is the best buffet now, I have been to every buffet in Vegas and countless cruise ships, they are all very ordinary. BTW, the eyes eat too, I uploaded a few pictures of Paris hotel, the decorations in the Village buffet created an cozy ambiance, I felt like I was in Provence or Burgundy, Brittany, etc..After dinner, you walk over to have a drink under the chandeliers, sitting on a corset bar stool, it was pretty cool!",3,1,4

They serve mimosas on the weekends so we were able to enjoy that last time.
I went here this past week with my husband, as a part of the Buffet of Buffets deal.
We tried Rio & Planet Hollywood and agreed this was the better of the 3.
Line wasn't long around dinnertime so I only waited about 7 minutes total to be seated.
The waiters are very friendly, and the theme is very nice.
I think I enjoyed my experience much more last time because it was my first time there, but I felt the food wasn't as fresh this time around.

Dinner: 
A good portion of the hot items were dry because they had been left out for a while, and the Truffle mac n cheese (which I enjoyed last time) was very, very dry.
Crab legs were cut in half, which made eating more convenient, but I thought they didn't taste very fresh.
I remember the cut tri-tips being amazing last time, but the ones at dinner were dry on the top, which made for tough chewing.
Everything else is pretty decent. Ended dinner with creme brulee. yumm.

Brunch:
We came back the following morning for brunch because we wanted to give this buffet another chance.
Truffle Mac n cheese was gooey and fresh this time, and the roast beef was pretty good too.
I really enjoyed the sausages (really tasty) and brussel sprouts.
Crepes didn't really spark my interest so I decided to go for the fresh omelettes, which were quite tasty. Ended my brunch with creme brulee. yumm

Tip: Try filling your plate with small, bite-size portions so you'll get a taste of everything and know what you like. I highly recommend going in the early afternoon because it's busier and food is constantly being refreshed.

Pistachio Lemon Macaroons - This is the redeeming factor of the whole Le Village Buffet. They are so amazingly good. I loved that the outside had little bits of pistachio and gave it a nutty taste.

I was the guy who walked past the 45 minute line to the little door they had on the side, flashed the card, and was like ""what up."" Then they said ""Yes, sir!"" and opened the doors to me and my party of ten. Ha.

Le Village Buffet (brunch buffet) was decent enough. The food was good, but nothing to knock your socks off and make you want to come back. 

We arrived around 10am and only had a few minute wait. By the time we left, there was a considerable queue to get seated. I didn't know this at the time, but apparently each station at the buffet represents a different region of France and, accordingly, the food at the various stations relates to the region's specialties (allegedly). Regardless, it made it a tad bit convoluted to gather food for your plate (first world problem - now I feel a little ashamed for complaining about a brunch with TOO much food to chose from). For example, fried hash brown wedges were at one station, hashbrowns across the room at another, potato wedges at another. You should take a stroll around the entire buffet first to see what they are offering. The crepe station was the most popular and there was a line the entire time we were there. 

The person who seated us took our drink orders (coffee, water, etc.) but couldn't take orders for mimosas. Once our waitress showed up, she took our order for mimosas. I thought they were unlimited, but she never returned to the table so not sure about that. I'm sure a few more mimosas and I would have remembered this buffet more fondly. :)

Summary: Decent enough. They had a large variety of standard breakfast food to chose from.",0,0,0

The light thin crepe with the sweet and slightly tart fruit eaten along some champange during brunch is truly awesome.  

Their seafood is pretty good but not the freshest.  They don't have a very good selection of sushi but they make up for in other dishes such as roasts and pastas.  There are various olive salads too if you're into that.  I thought the desert bar was much better than other buffets but I think they need a wider selection of fruits.

The crab legs didn't taste that good either...not fresh. The carving station only had prime rib, ham, and sausage...however there was no one to slice the meat...so everything became dry.

The prime rib was overdone and nothing special (buffet at Aria still has the best buffet prime rib).

The highlight of the meal would be the crepe station at the end, but forget getting a ""savory"" crepe that would have cheese meat and veggies as the lady cooking the crepe is in such a rush to get your crepe done and go on to the next, that the cheese inside the crepe hasn't melted even 1%...it's like eating a fork full of shredded cheese out of a bag at the supermarket...so go for the sweet crepe for dessert and skip the savory as any part of your meal.

It's a buffet, it is filled with buffet lovers and that kinda of food. The bacon was limp and not great. The pastries were good. I will say the sausage gravy was absolutely excellent.

There are a lot of options but the sausage gravy was the only thing that really stuck out to me. The coffee was meh, the service meh, and the food just a-ok. But there are options for everyone. This was good for a hangover, plenty of greasy options to soak it all up.

Needless to say, Jon A. and I got there a little earlier than we should have since we were talking up how much champagne we'd guzzle while we were there.

Misunderstood time aside, the breakfast buffet was actually pretty good! There was no wait at 8:00 AM on a Saturday, and we helped ourselves out to the bagels with lox (assemble yourself), goat cheese, made-to-order crepes, and all kinds of potato- and egg-derived breakfast foods, some of which happened to have a French-American twist. Multiple varieties of turkey sausage are available, too, which was nice since I didn't want to feel gross from eating too much pork sausage. The sliced ham was a pleasant surprise, and the corned beef hash was also tasty. The pastry selection impressed me, but I opted to skip them for more protein. The cones available for soft serve (vanilla or chocolate) are sugar cones with different combinations of sprinkles, chocolate shell, and other fancy-looking edible decorations.

The service was on the good side of average: our waitress was friendly and seemed to sincerely want to please, but it did take a couple tries to get refills on our orange juice. All of the waitstaff are wearing uniforms in what I suppose is French dress as interpreted by Americans.

Fake sky above you, and food stations scattered around: both contributed to the informal, casual atmosphere. We didn't feel rushed, and we weren't even worried that we were too early for the champagne brunch!

This is coming from someone who didn't have to wait in long lines, and who didn't pay the full price, as my smart, lovely wife purchased a groupon deal.  The deal also included a bottle of wine-more like grape juice.  There was no bright spot for the food.  The entire menu, and recipes need to be redone-soon!

As previous reviewers noted, service was slow.  I will give credit though, our server was really trying hard.  She brought out drinks as fast as her feet would allow, and she was very pleasant, polite, and professional considering the circumstances she works under.

Breakfast: smoked salmon, hash brown, bacon, omelette station, all the eggs and potatoes.
Get the CREME BRULEE, available only at lunch. King crab legs at dinner.
Cioppino with mussels, clams and scallops was my mom's fave.

Crepe station is awesome. There are both sweet and savory crepes. The guy who made my crepe was conversational--turns out he's from the bay area. Banana nutella crepe was delicious. We gave him a tip.

We kept forgetting to reserve a table...wish we remembered to do it instead of wasting time in line!",0,0,1

We were seated promptly in a small little room to ourselves with three windows and our own personal server.   At least it appeared that way.
So what to expect from the buffet?
Zeeeee crab legs in Zeeeee butter.
Le Prime rib...c'est tres bien.
I suggest the natural juices they provide for your prime rib and mashed potatoes.
Tri tip steak snuck out when I was almost done, yet I saved enough room for it.
Slightly red in the middle, had excellent flavor and wish I had made more room for this.
A great finish to our meal was the well prepared creme brûlée and \/ or the tart with a small variety of berries on it.
Superb service by our waiter and a fresh cup of coffee made for quite an evening of relaxation.

There were empty spaces on the serving stations. We had to look around to find a plate. The serving utensils at the desert station were filthy. I sampled three or four deserts, not one of them worth eating...the macaroons were beyond basic. I had prime rib (there was no ham when I was there) the first small piece was good.

They had savoury and sweet crepes to choose from. My first pick was the grilled chicken and spinach crepe. But the person making the crepes said they are out of chicken. I went there for breakfast, and the buffet just opened. How can they be out so fast? Or were they out since the evening of the previous night and they didn't replenish the chicken? Anyways I was quite disappointed how unprepared they were. I had to choose something else which was the caprese one. 

The other food items were mediocre. A lot of the food were cold. The desserts were bad. They have macarons but they are poorly put together and they have barely any taste. I don't expect much from a buffet. I guess Paris Le Village has decent food for a buffet. Would I come back? Probably not. I only wanted to have one buffet visit during my Vegas stay and I chose this one since I was at this hotel.

If it weren't for a $5 coupon, I would not have been happy. 

Perhaps it was because I went during the ""off season"" (meaning... three DAYS after new year's), but the food tasted like it had been sitting there for hours. Other than the crab, there was nothing worth eating really. Everything tasted bland and had too much cream added. Their stations aren't labeled (other than dessert), so you just have to guess what you're eating as you move down the counters. The desserts were pretty bad... the freshly made crepe was okay, but I'd recommend not getting any fillings. The crepe on its own is okay. 

I was so disappointed. I mean, isn't this supposed to be FRENCH food?! I know I can't expect Paris Vegas to be like Paris France, but STILL!

Despite the main floor being nearly empty, we were sat at a small table in a side room that looked run down and unkempt. The run down part I could attribute to being ""quaint, french country style"", but not the food stains on the wall at our table.
Plain scrambled eggs, scrambled eggs w\/ asparagus, and the quiche were ridiculously oversalted to the point of being inedible. Curiously, the frittatas and the eggs benedict were entirely unseasoned. I ended up having to chop up the frittata and mixing it with the scrambled egg to get something edible. Didn't try the made to order omelette, because there was a line that was moving very slow.
The smoked salmon looked pretty sad, but tested pretty good. The onions that went with it very chopped very rough, and there was no horseradish to be had. The smoked trout was very fishy.
The pastries we tried were ok, but all very light on sugar. I didn't mind it, but it was very one note. 
Highlights were the slab bacon and the prime rib hash. 
The most annoying part were the bussers clearing tables driving around carts piled with dirty dishes. The table next to ours had a larger party, and the cart full of dirty plates was parked a foot from our table for 5 minutes while the table was being cleaned and food debris scraped into the trash.

Service. It takes a REALLY long time for them to even acknowledge your drink is empty. They also don't take plates very quickly, but the second your entire party stands up to go get food, they're quick to try to turn your table around as if you've left.
Plates. It's impossible to find them. They don't seem to put any on the dessert station at all.

So when I stayed at Paris recently, I knew I had to go back to Le Village for brunch.  Whenever I walked by, there was a long line of patrons waiting to get in so I ended up eating elsewhere. On my last day at Paris, I decided to wait in the line to get in for what I was expecting to be a good meal.  Especially after seeing the crowd of people always waiting to get into this buffet, I was under the impression that it had to still be a good place to eat.  Boy was I wrong, after almost a 1 hour wait, we were seated in one of the small dining areas that are located off the main dining room and had a waitress that was not very friendly.  On top of that, the floor wasn't particularly clean and the silverware had spots on them.  The food itself was not good.  There was a variety to things to select from, but none of it tasted particularly good. None of it!!!!  I thought the crepes or the pastries would be delicious given that it's ""Paris"", but they weren't.  I felt like I was eating at a bad diner.  What a shame!  The quality of this buffet has definitely gone down over the last few years and I don't know why people are lining up to dine at Le Village.  I will not be returning to this buffet again.",0,0,0

如果喜歡吃甜點的甜點控是一定不能避免的~
因為是""巴黎""的關係，所以裡面的甜點基本上是屬於法式甜點
光是用想的就覺得好好吃喔!!

特別特別推薦~~~~~!!!
法式可麗餅~
有甜的跟鹹的(因為小奴婢英文屬於幼兒級，因此只會點甜的...)
甜的有香蕉和覆盆莓兩種喔~(說不定有更多種@@)
香蕉的醬是巧克力，就是傳說中的香蕉巧克力喔!!
奶霜有可以要求要雙倍(流口水)

The best things here is the prime rib, truffle mac and cheese and macaroons.  The crab legs (dinner only) are the same as planet Hollywood's with claws included. The salads were delicious and they had a respectable selection of salmon and sole fillet, cooked mussels and clams. Meats included delicious sausage, a carving station with stuffed lamb, prime rib, roasted turkey and roast beef, a tray of trip tips. There were repeated stations of clams. The scalloped potatoes are back instead of the mashed potatoes former reviewers have complained about.  I loved the sweet potatoes too! The crepe station is far better than planet Hollywood's remade stack - fresh and made in front of you. 

Avoid the sushi at all costs.  Why there is an Asian section in a parisian buffet is beyond me. The cheese selection as people have mentioned is anemic.

But the truffle mac and cheese! Oh they were the highlight for me and the macaroons have a place amongst the best I've had - including lauderee. The delicate cookie crust has the perfect crunch and the chocolate filling is airy albeit a little too much and i had to scrap some off. The creme brulee is solid.  Skip the tiramisu.

The decor is reminiscent of beauty and the beast very cute and Disney like with the street lights adding to the charm.

For brunch, they have a wide selection of breakfast items along with lunch\/dinner items such as crab legs & prime rib. I love how they have a crepe station (although there's typically a line), and they serve endless mimosas.

Servers can be hit & miss, but typically, our servers have been good. The managers are super awesome tho, & they always make sure we're well taken care of.

However we were pleasantly surprised that the waitresses kept returning to us to refill drinks and clear up plates, even though we were in one of the smaller side rooms. She even left us a canter of mimosa. 
The food on the other hand was just OK. The highly anticipated crêpes was the biggest downside after waiting 20 minutes in line to order. The crêpe was just too thick (it was more of a lighter pancake) and the filling tasted old due to being left out too long. The best dish was the clam which had a fradiavolo type sauce with it. They also had crab legs which were halved, so you don't have to crack it. The highlight of the meal was probably the crème brulee which I had to sadly force down ( I was disgustingly full, probably after drinking close to a pitcher of mimosa because I certainly don't remember eating much of the food).

There was so many different eggs and breakfast meat\/sausage type things, I always wonder why white folk come in hoards for breakfast...it always tastes the same to me...",18,22,19

There wasn't one edible or semi-good tasting item at this place. To start, half of the food wasn't labeled and the other half was labeled incorrectly. I'm glad I don't have any food allergies or I would have been in serious trouble (although a trip to the ER would have fared better than this buffet). The scrambled eggs were watery and under cooked, the bacon was chewy and sitting in a large puddle of its own grease, the fruit was set out next to the fish so had a fishy taste to it, the macarons were stale, falling apart and filled with whipped cream (how do you mess up a macaron at a FRENCH buffet?), the crepes were filled with canned pie filling rather than fresh fruit, the waffles were ice cold and hard.  Not to mention that everything looked dirty and old as well. The areas around the food bins were filthy and had bits of food all over them. 

The waitstaff didn't help the cause either. Everyone was incredibly rude. Bottomless mimosas are included in the price. My friend asked for one while she still had half of a glass in front of her. The waitress told her ""finish that first then I'll get you more"". Thanks mom. Meanwhile, other tables had full bottles of champagne on them. 

We were so appalled that we asked for a refund and the manager didn't even blink an eye. To me, that says that he gets complains like this all the time.  

Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money to go to Wicked Spoon at the Como. Steer clear of this place.",4,5,0

Well, dummie--  no Asian food because this is a FRENCH Buffet, representing 8 or 9 regions of FRANCE (Brittanny, Burgundy, Provence, Savoie, etc.).   Nothing but ""French food"" (okay some American style too).

Atmosphere a little dark. Wait staff have to wear some silly French costume,  Room is set up like some Fake-o French plaza--Reminds me of Disneyland exhibits.

Breakfast foods galore-- bacon, sausage, egg white frittata, spinach omelet, croissants, apple sweet rolls, waffles, and marvelous CREPES--You must have them!  As well as Lox and bagels, Lyonnaise potatoes (yum!!) and other goodies.    

Arrive at 10:30 or so, as you get the best of both worlds--they end breakfast around 11am-ish & start to put out lunch items:  Beef Burgundy, Chicken Chausser, Ceasar salad, etc.  Desserts were wonderful:  flan, crème brulee, cakes,cheesecake, tarts, tortes, and other 'nummie' things.

Highlights of our food: the mashed potatoes, the truffle pasta, the prime rib, the sushi (don't be scared), the creme brûlée, and the crepe station. 

Bummer items: carrots (not done enough), sweet potatoes (also not done), beet salad (lukewarm), duck (too tough).

Half the dessert weren't even French and the lady working at the dessert station threatened me because I took too many fruits, saying I can't take them out because they have security at the door.

Unfortunately, there's a really big gap between #1 (Bacchanal) and anywhere else. Like most buffets, this place has some solid dishes and a lot of fillers. Their gimmick, being in the Paris casino, is having French dishes. Unfortunately, buffet-quality French simply isn't that great.

HITS: chicken de Provence, truffle and veggie cavatappi pasta, prime rib was solid, eggs were cheesy as hell if you're into that sort of thing, crepe station, Sunday brunch includes champagne that is surprisingly good despite low retail price, limited dessert selection for  a place that's hyping up their French affiliation.

MISSES:  French onion soup is super salty dregs, pate at charcuterie area is not good, their entire sushi selection consists of literally a single crab maki roll, entirely too many breakfast options still out at 2PM, heated plates at dessert station lead to melted desserts. 

SERVICE: They're busy, I get that. Hostess is inefficient, three groups of 6+ held up the line for half an hour until someone came up and figured out that pairs could be seated immediately and the line started moving again. Our server either had far too many tables or short term memory loss, served half our drink order then forgot the alcohol until we reminded her half an hour later (the next time we saw her).

I love buffets, and I love Vegas buffets.  My partner and I take them very seriously and actually plan our trip around them. 

Paris Le Village Buffet was always a MUST for breakfast.  

But in the 4 years or so since I have visited, it has gone WAY down hill.

In the past, you could try cheeses and pates, freshly baked breads and croissants, crusty quiches,  just an amazing assortment. If you could think of a breakfast dish, it was there -- and it was well made. 

Imagine our disappointment to discover that our beloved buffet has become nothing but a laden trough of processed dishes that taste at best--average.  

Seriously, it all tasted like it had been bought from Sam's Warehouse. 

I give it two stars since they still have the freshly made crepe station and the service was good, but honestly this is not worth waiting in line for in anyway.

Fortunately the line was short. People making the crepes looked miserable. Then again, some of them come across customers like this one lady that held up the line because she forced the lady to remake her crepe because she supposedly put the wrong topping on her crepe"". Everyone in line made sure that chick knew she was dumb. So after she got her crepe, the same lady made mine. I felt bad for how that lady was to her so I tipped her a dollar. She instantly put a smile on her face and I think she felt appreciated and treated me well also. This buffet had snow crabs and shrimp galore. It made me a happy gal as I love seafood!

There are other options to choose from and the Paris buffet was the most high end from the list (Rio, Harrah, Flamingos, etc) so I thought. It's the Monday after Christmas weekend therefore it's considered holiday pricing normally $30 vs $38. The one big mistake I forgot to do is make a reservation, they do it one day in advance. Instead we had to wait 1.5 hours 6pm on a Monday. The hostess was really nice and sat us in a quieter room away from the crowds. However, once you get in, I felt instantly overwhelmed by all the people rushing to get food. There were tons of large families. The restaurant did a good job cranking out food, stocking utensils, clearing tables, grabbing refills. They are certainly making their money, however it just felt very impersonal, rushed, etc. The staff definitely works hard but I felt they were way understaffed. I saw a waiter just give 2 of every drink to keep people occupied. $12 unlimited drink add on is worth it but I passed this time. 

Now the food, one their website they are known for truffle mac and cheese, prime rib, and crab legs. Those were exactly the highlights of the meal. Everything else was very sub par. I actually like they had lots of vegetarian options but the taste was awful, under seasoned, seems they just boiled them. Not too much meat option they had pre cut rotisserie chicken and lamb leg. The seafood wasn't the best quality, yes there is shrimp and crab legs but they are skimpy. The sushi and soup station was messy and unappetizing. They had a large variety of bread and desserts.

What they serve is usually pretty good. I remember they did a tri-tip one night that was absolutely excellent, and their prime rib never disappoints. They also get points for a very good dessert section.

If you get the Buffet of Buffets deal (which I'd advise; if you eat at more than one buffet in 24 hours, it pays for itself), or are just in the neighborhood, this is a pretty solid lunch or dinner option (haven't eaten breakfast here, so I can't comment on that).

I don't care for places like the Rio where there is an abundance of food but the quality SUCKS! Another important factor is price. I don't feel like spending nearly $50 on a buffet. There's no way I can eat $50 worth of food in my opinion.

Which leads me to the Paris buffet. I came here during the lunch hour which on a weekend is called brunch. Spent about $27 which is adequate price for a Vegas buffet. Although some places are much more higher and some are even cheaper.

The ambiance is fantastic. You almost feel like your in Europe sitting in a little cafe with other tourist. You feel like your not in Vegas at all. It's quite cute actually.

The quality of the food is fantastic!! It's cooked very well I didn't eat anything I didn't like. I tried as much as I could. I was very fond of the 2 different types of chicken they had. Baked and roasted. They were both so tender and juicy. So full of flavor! Their pesto pasta was quite awesome too. They also have a decent tasty quiche!!

The best part of the buffet had to be the desserts though. They have such an array of desserts and everything tasted so delicious! They had cheesecake, flan, chocolate\/vanilla ice cream, cookies, baked goods, fruit, and my personal favorite, CREME BRULEE!!

The creme brulee tasted awesome. My boyfriend loved the flan. I was actually quite impressed with the vanilla soft serve ice cream. It was very yummy and had a french vanilla flavor to it.

They have only a few things you can put on. That day they only had chocolate, blueberry, pear and pickled cherries. They didn't even have bananas or anything like that. Their fruit selection could have been better by a lot, as they only really offered melon. The crab legs were only okay, but not great.

I have to say though that the deserts was good, except, i had really wished there was something better than soft serve as a cold dessert.

Expectations weren't that high considering I already knew Wynn, Bellagio, or Studio B buffet would trounce this place any day of the week, even on an off night.

The breads just sucked, no flavor and questionably stale. Insulting to the French culture to serve bread that just isn't good, and calling themselves Paris Las Vegas. I've had better at Hue Thai and Baguette Cafe. 

The fettuccine alfredo just tasted like watered down alfredo mix. I know this is a buffet, but how can you fail so badly with fettuccine alfredo? The pesto sauce spaghetti helped to redeem them.

The mussels weren't even remotely fresh, with a strong fishy taste. A sign that it wasn't very fresh. 

My experience was the mussels didn't make me want to chance it with the sushi. I didn't want a dose of lax with my meal. The other person in our group confirmed its suckiness, and he isn't as hard of a reviewer as me.

Half of the chicken was very moist since it was near the skin, and the other half was dryer than Vegas on a summer day.

One of the saving grace of the meal was the crepes and waffle station. It amazed me how the chef was just making the crepes with ease. This and the waffles tasted great.

The first round of prime rib was a little dry. Round 2 and 3 were much better, but they were also very rare. It would make even Dexter faint. I could have loaded up on this all day, but a little too early in the day to do this.

This place does have snow crab legs and claws, but its such a PITA to eat because they don't crack it open nicely like the Wynn. I'm sure there are people who would have loaded up on this, but it wasn't worth my time.

The champagne was a poor quality. Don't bother unless you just want the free alcohol. Just go play at the penny slots and get yourself some free drinks instead.

I didn't get a chance to try the desert, but the others in our group says its good.

Our group got a nice cozy and quiet room, but also got a rocky table. We McGuvyer'd it with a bunch of sugar packets on the base of the table.

Service from our first waiter just wasn't good. He forgot which drinks we ordered. Carding me for the champagne even though I didn't want any, couldn't even recognize the birthday on my Nevada ID, and still pouring the champagne into my glass even after I said no. Even interrupting our conversation just to pour the champagne in front of my face. Just either walk around to pour the glasses or just take the glass off the table to pour. I know this isn't a 5 star place, but a little common sense goes a long way. Our second waiter was more attentive, clearing our plates in a timely manner and refilling our drinks without asking.

But $30 for mediocre to below average food for lunch when I can spend a couple of bucks more at the Wynn and get dinner, makes this place already lose a star. Had it been a little less, it would be understandable. 

Go to the Studio B buffet if you're coming from SoCal, much better stuff and cheaper prices. Otherwise, spend a little more money for the Bellagio or the Wynn. You're on vacation, spend the extra couple of bucks to get a better meal.",1,1,1

La Village Buffet had a pretty ample selection of items from the standard crab legs and prime rib...to some ""regional"" offerings such as lamb and cheese plates. But even the items I wouldn't say were ""bad"" were lacking. Items that should have carried the buffet just dropped dead.

The layout was weird. Not as straight-forward as other buffets, which separate their food from the table.

I cannot complain for that price not to mention the sizable selection they have spanning across multiple ethnic foods and a decent dessert bar\/station. Their dessert bar isn't as nice as Wynn's and my favorite place and the mother of all quality buffets overall would have to be Bellagio. However, I would probably be paying about double what I paid at Paris and more than half of the buffet food that the other two serve can be found at Paris. 

The service has been quite good each time I went to this buffet. Although there was a line (be prepared to wait a bit though I was able to get in with a 15 minute wait), it removed rather quick. I was seated and grabbed my food. The server came by to grab my drink orders and to subsequently check in multiple times. 

Even without the coupon, I would go there again. It offers a wide selection of food while being more affordability than many places on the strip. The food is way better than other buffets that are a couple dollars less such as Imperial Palace's or Circus Circus.",1,1,1

There is also a Provence station, a Normandy station and a Alsace-Lorraine station. Being my mother's mother's family is from Alsace-Lorraine, I am immensely interested in what they have to serve.

Cons:
They do NOT take same day reservations.
Their spinach dip is horrible

The candied nuts they use are not fresh and have that refrigerated taste. All the meat dishes I tried were delicious. The prime rib was cooked just right and the pork apple dish was yummy, much better than the dry chewy crap at The Bacchanal. Their hot cherries were good. I think it's hilarious how they have sushi.

Wine(Red) - tasted like vinegar :( ...could have used it as a dipping sauce for the crab meat

Food - I love crab legs. They had them but they were still half frozen, no taste and barely had any meat in them. Disappointing. Their mediterranean station was tucked into a corner.

This episode features Le Village Buffet in Las Vegas.  Le Village Buffet, located inside Paris Las Vegas, is one of my favorite places to eat.  To set the record straight before we move forward, the food itself is mediocre but the ambiance of the place is absolutely fabulous!  

After paying for your buffet fees, you walk into this beautiful french court yard with houses and flowers.  All this is created like a french village under a light blue sky.  I know it's a buffet but it's actually romantic enough to take a date out!  There you can really wine and dine her by picking up all sorts of tasty treats from each of the buffet stations.... isn't that awesome?  

I'm not crazy about their pasta dishes so I'll pass on that... but they did have the typical meat sauce, and alfredo sauce pastas, and a pesto cream penne dish.

Along the way I had trial portions of roast chicken, duck, sausage, salmon, roast veggies, stone crabs, and all of them tasted pretty good!  The one dish that really stood out for me was a butter steamed sole...  The fish was curled and wrapped very nicely into the shape of a rose, and steamed to perfection!  Sole itself is already soft and moist and this was just a rose of yumminess!  They came in small pieces like an actual rose so I had about 6 roses of it..... but a totally healthy and tasty dinner for me here for sure!

As for dessert, lots of selections from bread pudding, cookies, cheesecakes, creme brulee, flan, ice cream, fruit tarts, etc.  All pretty tasty especially the creme brulee.... creamy and milky as the dessert melts in your mouth after leaving your spoon..... Just a really good ending to a nice night of buffet experience.

The best thing about this buffet is the crepe bar. They have basic to moderate ingredients that makes starting the day with a nutella, banana, and bacon crepe simply great. 

If sweet breakfast is not your thing then try hitting up the savory brunch options. In the hour between breakfast and lunch they start to bring out lunch options which is an added bonus if you're looking for more savory dishes. 

If there is still room for dessert try one of each of the pastries. You're in Vegas you have to live a little.

I'd say my experience was just ok, not impressed at all for a Vegas buffet, given that the competition has gone up with the new buffets opening up like Wicked Spoon and the oh-so-glorious Bacchanal buffet that everyone should go at least once.

Anyhow, back to this Le Village buffet. The best part is the bucket of crab legs that we ordered for our table. Five of us of course devoured all the crab legs. I believe they were snow crab not Alaskan King but I do like both so I was a happy camper chowing down the crab! The entrees were not bad, edible, but nothing so great. I enjoyed their French onion soup, some pasta and the duck, but I could tell they didn't put any effort in there, which was quite disappointing. 

Even more disappointing was the dessert section... REALLY? Cookies at a buffet? Are you kidding me? Their creme brulee wasn't done well. It's old and the caramelized sugar was not crispy anymore. I walked around the dessert booth twice and I didn't pick up ANYTHING. I just tried one bite of my friend's creme brulee.

No Vegas buffet is worth goin' if it ain't got good desserts.

Service was amazing though! Loved our server. So friendly, helpful and cheerful. 

The decor of the buffet was ok. Honestly it doesn't look like a place to dine. Maybe because the walls don't go up all the way, I feel like I was still eating in a shopping mall, like a food court kind of deal. Weird. I know other buffets like Bacchanal doesn't have an actual room with walls either, but their decor is much more like a restaurant than a food court...

- Nice atmosphere  (not your regular florescent buffet lighting).
- Every buffet has prime rib BUT this was the best I've had in Vegas. It was perfectly seasoned with salt & spices and so, so, TENDER.   
- Great selection of food, organized around french regions.
- The Seafood bar is not as large as the Rio but the clams & mussels were superb. 
- Even the ice cream machine is A+ with Vanilla Custard (not just plain vanilla soft serve).

The food was good and there was hardly anyone getting crab legs, so I got my fill. (This makes up for a terrible experience two years ago, where I waited two hours to get in to brunch, and the server refused to replenish the crab legs.)
The best part is the crepe station, where the very friendly cook makes delicious stuffed crepes to order. YUM!
The only drawback is that they seem to be understaffed, and the wait for drinks and to have plates removed, takes forever. All in all,
I will definitely go back, and I now prefer this buffet to the one at Bellagio.",0,0,0

For being a hotel directly on the strip and with a name like Paris I feel like this buffet had a name to live up to and it sure did disappoint. 

First of all the service sucked.  We saw our server once the whole time we were there. Only when he asked what we wanted to drink. We got no refills, no plates cleared, no ""do you need anything else."" nothing. 

Food was even worse. For the food that was there, since most items were empty, it was either underwhelming and bland or saltier then the sea. Everything looked old and made you question just how long everything was out. Only a couple of the dishes were labeled correctly so everything was a guessing game. Buffet in general was very small as well. Selection was tiny. Was looking forward to dessert hoping it would save the night but boy was I wrong. Flan was gross. Tasted packaged. The FRENCH macaroons weren't even made properly. (for those of you who do or don't know the smooth side is supposed to be out where you can see it and the ugly rough side should be inside) well then had it all wrong. And the only filling they had was chocolate on different color shells. Food overall was bad.

Now let's go for cleaniness. All the windows to guard the food had grease and grime all over it. Since they don't spend time on the food they should at least clean now and then. 

Overall a very very disappointing buffet.",4,0,0

And, once again, because of my parents and their rewards card, we didn't have to stand in an hour-long line...

Now, I am a huge fan of the breakfast meats.  Any variety, and shape, and size.  Almost every station had at least one type of breakfast meat.  Better yet, one entire station was all breakfast meats.  I was overwhelmed!!  I took a huge breath, then made the smart choice to sample some foods before I committed and took a giant portion.  One of my faves was a beef and turkey sausage with sweet potato and maple syrup.  It's got it all in one casing!! So yummy.  I also greatly enjoyed the poached eggs Basquaise.  It was a poached egg with a really delicious, somewhat spicy tomato sauce.  My breakfast dessert was a crepe with Nutella and blueberries--YUMMO!!  And it's always nice when the coffee's good.

They have some other selections which just look weird! Some type of soups, stews, sausage with onion?

They also have their carving station with the usual, and I hate prime rib so I wont even rate it.  Their turkey is OK.  Surrounded by their carving station, the usual sides mashed potatoes,  carrots, legumes, country fried potatoes.  And again, it all is just AVERAGE.

We went for brunch on November 12; our disappointment is as follows:

1. Entrees: prime rib was significantly undercooked and tough to chew. Best left for those who like to chew on bloody towels. Tri-tip steak was equally tough and overcooked. ""Sushi"" was, on my estimate, 80% rice\/seaweed, 15% soggy breading, 5% shrimp. The main highlights were the buttery mashed potatoes and dessert crepes - seriously, the mashed potatoes were the best thing there. Much of the other entrees were dry and untouched, largely things that you wouldn't want at a Vegas buffet: spaghetti, penne pasta, mixed vegetables. Crab legs were okay - skinny without significant meat. Other foods like sausage, bacon, pancakes, waffles were all bland and just plain boring, as evidenced by their dryness sitting under the heat lamps for hours. 

My honest opinion is that you could get better quality and variety of food at a Golden Corral. 

2. Desserts: flan was too eggy and pudding like, lacked the airy consistency desired in French made flan. Creme brûlée was okay; burnt sugar collapsed with scoop of the spoon and did not break cleanly - likely because it had been sitting. Macaroons taste cheap and have cake frosting filling. 

My honest opinion is that you should just go to McDonalds and get a McFlurry. 

3. Ambiance: Cheap, like a 90's theme park waiting to be renovated. False bricks and dusty old signs leave nothing to be desired, completely unromantic and opposite from the true Paris. Tacky. Furniture is reminiscent of a 90's Perkins. 

My honest opinion is that you and your date might strike the mood better at a Chuck e Cheese. 

4. Price: $30.99 for brunch and bottomless mimosas til 3PM. It's what you expect for this price in Vegas. 

My honest opinion is that you should spend a little bit more money for a significantly better buffet elsewhere in hotels in the same vicinity. 

5. Service: possibly the only redeeming quality of this buffet; the attendants met expectation and removed dirty plates and refilled water\/mimosas in a timely manner.",2,3,0

They were out of Nutella for the crepes, so I downgraded to plain ol' chocolate, but it was that yucky, bland, overly-sweet Nestle stuff, I think.  Didn't end up eating it, but the whipped cream was amazing.
Pan a' chocolate was a bit dry.
Sushi was a small selection, but all were made very well, fresh, and great flavours - good job, sushi chef!

Le Village Buffet, along with the buffet at the Bellagio, are two of my favorite buffets on the strip, although I haven't tried the one at Wynn's yet. The ambience here is wonderful and brings me memories of me and hubby sitting outside a cafe in the real Paris sucking on escargot. Well, just me with the escargot bit because hubby would never eat snails.

The snow crab legs and cocktail shrimps are always good here, and this time around they had Jonah crab claws. I was surprised to find out that Jonah crabs used to be considered a nuisance to New England lobstermen, as I found them sweet and delicious. There were delicious baked oysters too, but no raw ones.

The dessert section is wondeful. Their creme brulee is perfect, and they have a crepe bar where they will make your crepe to order. We always seem to end our dinner with soft serve.

They also have good flan, nice and light. 

My mom was able to have her crab legs warmed up by the waiter, although I prefer my snow crab legs fresh and chilled as I find them juicier that way. The waiters, of course, bring you all the drinks you want.

(Coincidentally, they charged us the dinner rate at $30 instead of $18). Brunch, by the way, included all-you-can-drink champagne. Yay!
The food was good. In fact, it was above average for a buffet. But here's the thing - where is the French food? As far as I could tell, here is what they had that might qualify - French Onion Soup, Eggs Benedict, Crepes, and Creme Brulee. Yes, its true that (I've always been told), cooking French food takes time, care and a wee bit of TLC, but come on - there's got to be a few dishes that they could add to the menu. If space is an issue, try taking away the sushi area (which is the one areas of the buffet that is kind of sad, actually). Not all buffets need to be all things to all people, but should have a certain consistency.  Help us out Vegas - if all the buffets verge on being the same - why don't I just go to the least expensive one?

It all depends on often people leave. They offered bottomless drinks for an additional fee. There was a table that was sitting next to us that had already finished eating and was drinking and socializing for the 1.5 hours we were there. That's probably why the wait times there are long. But honestly any buffet in Vegas your going to wait a minimum of 30 minutes. If it's quicker are you sure you really want to eat there? We also ended up having three different servers while we were there so the first two did not receive a tip because they were already gone by the time we left. It's like they changed them every hour or so. I would recommend giving the servers that bring you your drinks a few bucks each time they come to your table much like the servers while you are gambling at the tables. The best part of the buffet was the deserts! They were absolutely amazing! And I'm not really a desert person. I wish I did not eat so much during dinner.

Sadly, we were only here for breakfast, but even that and a hint of some lunch items was enough for me to give it four stars. I'm pretty sure that it was $21.99 per person for the breakfast buffet, which came out to $51 something. 

I'm not going to lie; sometimes, I felt lost maneuvering through the buffet because the décor was a little overwhelming, and made it a little hard to find the food. that sounds a little dumb, but there was at least once where I didn't venture over to an area because I didn't know it was another station full of food. what i'm trying to tell you is that you need to walk around. some tucked away areas looked like they were just for dining, but there was even more food! what?!?!? 

again, we were there for the breakfast buffet. I've never seen so many plates of eggs and potatoes, and potatoes and eggs! there was plenty of bacon and sausage, as well. They had brioche, waffles, pancakes, and biscuits and gravy. This review is getting hard to write because I really can't remember all the food that they had out! haha. Faves? Lyonese potatoes, and a pasta dish with truffle oil and asparagus. 

Their dessert section had a LOT of croissants and other pastries, carrot cakes, cheesecakes, and crème brulee. Faves? tiny chocolate cake, and creme brulee.

They had a made-to-order crepe station and omelette station. The hubby loved the two crepes that he loaded up on: caprese and mixed berry. I, on the other hand, tried an omelette with mushroom, ham, and eggs, which was yum. What i probably loved most about the buffet was that the two people who were operating these two stations were sooooo pleasant. They didn't seem to hate their jobs even though they were the only ones there to help their line of 10 to 15 people. I'm a sucker for great customer service. 

Ok. On the contrary, our first server had a serious attitude. So much so that she was actually arguing with the table next to us. I'm not going into that too much because she was replaced by another server, who was able to smile and not throw straws or napkins at our table. 

All in all, this buffet was probably the best we've been to in Vegas. The ones we've visited within the past two years have been such a disappointment and waste of money.

The spiral macaroni and cheese with mushrooms and asparagus was very tasty and the fruit tarts and the chocolate eclair were quite good.  On the other hand, it seemed like the mussels had been reheated a couple of times because as much as I love mussels, I couldn't eat those mussels.  They were dried out and hard, it was the weirdest thing.  I got the fist batch from the main buffet line, and thinking it was a fluke, I went to the seafood station to try those mussels and those were just as bad.  It was almost like jerky
Moving to the meats, I decided that I was going to try their lamb and the carver didn't even cut me a fresh piece.  Instead he gave me 2 really little pieces, I'm talking like slivers, that were already cut and sitting on the board and I think I was so shocked at the piece that he gave me that I didn't say anything.  I put a few more things on my plate and sat down to eat.  
Turned out that the portion of lamb was good because the piece was so dry and hard that I couldn't even eat it.  By this time I was so disappointed I couldn't eat anymore from the main line. 
I asked for a glass of wine and was TOLD that I would have to pay $4.23 for a glass of wine but I wasn't told how I was supposed to pay for a glass, I was just TOLD what the price was.  If all this wasn't enough, the busser pushed a cart full of dirty dishes right pass me, so close I had to move my elbow.  This dirty dishes cart stayed in the main room of the restaurant and actually got in the way of the customers at times.  I look up to see one of the bussers scraping the food off the plate and into a tray on the cart. It just killed my appetite and I was done.",0,0,0

This place pretty much killed me from ever even wanting to stay or eat at a CET resort. Kinda. I'd stay, (not at Paris tho) but I'd be very careful what I eat. I gained platinum in a short time so ya I gamble. And my prize was a free buffet. Wowee. Yuck. 

You know that scene in Vegas vacation where they go to that rank buffet? I felt like this. The crepes were ok. Barely. Probably only edible thing. I had the ultimate nerve to ask a woman near crab legs if they could heat them. She yelled ONLY FOR 7 STARS!! (Picture the soup nazi screaming). Wow. Really?  So I actually had my first ever experience with spitting out a dessert. I love my sugar but the flan gagged me. And I'm Texan. We love our flan. This was rotten. Horrible. None of the meat was good. I ate a small salad. Hard to mess that up. 

Macaroons. Ok those were exceptional. We were starving and ate like 5 each. 

I would not eat here again if it were free. And it was. It is that nasty. Oh and we not once got a single refill on our iced teas. Hubby dropped a fork and we had to get a new one because no one ever bothered to check on us. Avoid. 

Ohhh one more thing. We had to walk all the way there and were sent back to TR desk to get the voucher for or fabulous dinner. They accused us of already using it. Lol. We had eaten a 250$ dinner about 40 hrs earlier at BLT. Received the offer about 10pm from TR desk. Was told had to use with in 48 hours. At TR desk poor girl had to beg front desk manager to allow us to use this. He said 48 hrs starts at 6am even thought we got it at 10pm. Please explain that to normal people haha. It was 36 to 49 hrs from time we got it. Who said 6am?  It sounded made up. Then manager of TR desk said ""I show you used this at 10 pm night before last"" um we had just eaten a 5 course meal at an upscale steak house at 8pm. I can most assuredly say we did not turn around and eat at a buffet in another CET resort. Oink oink. 

Very argumentative and very unprofessional. Balding guy. Wouldn't get up from behind this small little window cut out of an office. I felt sorry for his worker who was really sweet. Because of this I will never stay at Paris. I liked Ballys and they seemed proficient. But Paris as a whole really turned us off 100%. I take pics usually. But didn't waste my camera space.",4,6,0

We stowed our bags at Planet Hollywood and made our way to Paris, where we were able to pay the $24.99 ""breakfast"" price due to our pre-10 am arrival. Our wait in line was probably around 10 minutes, more than enough time for us to deduce that the additional ~$13 fee for ""All You Can Drink"" (beer, wine, Champagne, mimosas, Bloody Marys) would be money well-spent. And well-spent it was. Our server Deborah was just the sweetest gal, and she kept those mimosa glasses topped off.

Overall, we were pretty impressed with the food at Le Village. Of all the things I sampled, the only weak spot was the Eggs Benedict. The scrambled egg dishes, however, were great as were the hashbrowns. The bacon was paper-thin but tasty! I loved the pretzel rolls, and my friend raved about the apple-filled pastry she got. She would have loved to have tried a savory crepe, but unfortunately the line for that station was always pretty long.

It turned out that we had great timing for our visit as around 10:30-11:00 the breakfast foods began to be transitioned over to lunch items - caprese salad, pastas, mashed potatoes and dolmas were all excellent. There was also a lunchtime selection of seafood, carved roast, and various Asian selections that I didn't really explore but might on a future visit!

First of all... the food. A lot of it was bland or not even interesting\/tasty-looking enough (to me) to pick up. The sushi looked old and dry. Everything else was just.... eh. I usually find buffets dangerous because I end up eating too much at them (which was mostly okay for this trip because we ended up having about one meal a day thanks to them), but in this case I barely had anything to eat. It costs about the same per person as ordering one dish at any of the other restaurants so I was thinking the selection would be great to have, but boy was I wrong.

The only thing that made me happy here was the creme brulee and the raspberries on some of the dessert items. I love raspberries.

Second of all? It took us almost the entire meal before a very winded waitress finally came by for our drink orders. I tried stopping somebody and asking at one point, and they just said ""Oh she's busy trying to get everybody else drinks. She'll get to you guys."" I love getting my drink at the end of my meal?

1. You can book online via OpenTable 24 hours in advance to skip the line.

2. If less than 24 hours in advance call for a reservation.

3. If you are a Total Rewards member (free to join) you get a tiny discount.

4. There are 5 regions of France represented here.

5. There are different dining rooms & Le Petit Bar

6. All cocktails are $18 and a bottle of wine is a better buy.

I think I qualify as a foodie.  I studied cooking for a year. Plus, I have gotten to the point that if I can make something I don't buy that dish at restaurants especially if I can easily source the ingredients locally. Furthermore, if I love something I learn to make it ASAP.

Keep in mind this is a buffet. Dinner for two here is the price of one dinner (including appetizers and dessert) at Mon Ami Gabi. This is not Gordon Ramsay Steak.  Don't expect five star gourmet anything.  Expect French type food that can be made easily and taste good.  Expect to see other European influences.  Please tour the buffet area before making your selections. To get the most bang for your buck you might want to do this with salad plates instead of full sized plates.  That way you can try a little of most things.

Foods to skip:
Duck L'orange - dry
Salmon - dry
French Onion Soup - there is no cheese

Foods to try:
Lamb
Crêpes
Maracon
Spinach Salad
Yukon Gold Potatoes
Anything involving visible truffles

*-Indicates my personal favorites...

Drinks:
Waters all around w\/ my Glass of Sprite

First Round:
-Prime Rib (red and succulent, a bit tough to chew)
-Short Rib (perfectly cooked, came off the bone quite nicely)*
-Pesto Pasta (consistent with what I've had in the past)
-Truffle Mash Potatoes (barely got the taste of truffle, maybe it wasn't accented)
-Roasted Duck (too much oil and lacked any protein to consume)

Second Round:
-Duck Confit (much better in seasoning, not as oily, full of skin)*
-Greens w\/ Balsamic Vinaigrette (lettuce and dressing, nothing more)
-Ravioli (Cannot recall the type of cheese, it escapes me, but filling)
-Mac and Cheese (I can make better, it was shaved with a lot of Parmesan and something else)

Third Round (Dessert):
-Peanut Butter Cookie (second favorite dessert, moist and gooey)
-Creme Brulee (yeah it's that good; not pictured I consumed four more; perfectly caramelized crunch on top, the creamy core is magnificent)******
-Whipped Lemon Tart (I'm not a big fan of lemon meringue, it's tart and moist for the most part)
-Raspberry Cheesecake (again moist, with a good balance of tart raspberry would have preferred it to be Strawberry)

Total cost of Buffet came out to about $22.00 with tip. Good times, I ordered about two other plates for which I did not have pictures of. But all I remember was being a fatty and consuming more Creme Brulees, Duck Confit, Short Rib, and Salad. 3.5 is my rating for now.",5,4,4

None of the food here is actually spectacular but none of it is bad either and the variety sure doesn't disappoint. And when I'm talking variety I mean all the trappings you'd expect out of a good Vegas buffet experience: solid breakfast bar, meat station, salad bar, kabob bar, and so forth. I think the standouts for me included the creme brulee, the omelette station, smoked salmon, and some of the fish entrees.

I guess my only real gripe with the place is the arrangement of the place...everything seems physically congested and when they wheel out the trash bins for clean up you might feel like it can get kind of close to the food. Still, the ambiance is nice...Disney-esque in a way since the buffet tries to mimic the feeling of eating in a French village. 

Service was good here and your standard drinks like sodas and juices (and refills) come with the regular price - I can't say with certainty whether you get champagne refills though. Le Village Buffet is definitely a decent buffet that doesn't rank among the very best buffets I've had, but its certainly one of the more well valued buffets I've been to.",2,1,2

They have your usual meat carving station and even crab legs, but most of the food was mediocre at best. I thought the lamb and prime rib was pretty good, but not amazing. The shrimp and crab legs were left for you to peel and crack on your own. Being the lazy person that I am, I didn't enjoy that too much, especially when the crackers were nowhere to be found. The one thing that I really enjoyed was the crepe station. They had made to order crepes, with your choice of fruit fillings or nutella. Being the greedy person that I am, I got two, which stuffed my stomach beyond capacity. It was not a good feeling. This was also before I enjoyed those delicious mini bread bowls filled with a seafood mix. I was impressed that they actually had macarons, which are quite laborious to make. Unfortunately, I was not impressed by how they tasted. They tasted very stale and the filling wasn't good at all. I guess it was to be expected because this was a buffet and not Bouchon Bakery. Le Village is a little bit cheaper compared to the other buffets in Vegas, but I think I would spend the extra few bucks to have a higher quality food product.",1,0,1

I'll start off first by saying even though I liked this place, my mom and my brother didn't. They didn't like the food because they weren't used to French food... but I didn't even know that they served that much French food besides the crepe making. But yeah, I'm not sure sure on that either.

Anyways, I've been here for brunch and dinner on separate occasions and I'll just say that the food is pretty good. One time I remember filling up my plate so much and eating all of it. I like the crepes here and the omlets that the chefs make for you. The only bad thing is that there's always a line for this..but it's pretty worth it.

I ate here multiple times on different occasions using the 24 hour buffet pass. But yeah, it's a pretty good buffet compared to some other ones. Out of the 7 buffets that the buffet pass comes with, I say Le Village Buffet tops Emperor's Buffet in Imperial Palace and Lago Buffet in Caesar's.",0,0,0

We did the 24-hour buffet of buffets and we liked the food here so much we came here for lunch AND brunch.

I don't understand people's complaints about lack of selection... how much food do you need?!? They had pretty much every kind of protein (fish, beef, pork, shellfish) and several different types of starches and vegetables.  Personally, I loved the Brussels sprouts.

My favorite - by FAR - was the omelette station.  Yummy!! The crepe station was pretty great, too.  My husband loved the crab legs.  The unlimited mimosas for brunch was a nice added bonus.

All the food was really flavorful...none of that bland other crap we had at some other buffets.  While a little corny and ""Disney-ish"", I actually really enjoyed sitting in the little village that they created inside Paris.  It was cute.

There was a line for the buffet, but not as long as at some of the other buffets we saw (like Caesar's) and it moved fairly well.  I think we stood in line for 20 minutes, which for a Saturday at 10:00am really wasn't bad.  There was no line at all when we came for lunch on Friday.

Tips: 
-Set up a reservation online to avoid the lines. Then you can walk in through the VIP side with a much shorter wait. 
-There is a groupon online, we unfortunately could not use it because of the day we chose to eat brunch, but, it is a great deal to check out before you come. (I think you can only use it on weekends)
-Rather than ask for 2 mimosas, ask for champagne and just make your own mimosas at the table. Save your waitress time people.

Usually, the line for this buffet is ridiculous. My visit to Vegas this time was mid-week, and I was fortunate enough to choose a good time to chow down, as the line was a scant 20 people deep.

Pretty interior, lots of seating, interesting sections which gave you a feeling like there was inside seating and outside seating because of little 'rooms' within the seating area. 

Plenty of choices to satisfy most cravings. Standard buffet fare and some non-standard selections as well. Most people gravitate to the crab legs at buffets, I'm more of a prime rib kinda gal. The prime rib here was pretty good. I admit, I grabbed some of the mushroom sauce meant for the Chateaubriand instead of the au jus. I think it was a good choice. 

Other items I had were the brussel sprouts (don't judge me), kielbasa and sauerkraut, chicken with a wine\/mushroom sauce. All very, very good. Desserts were plentiful. I tried a creme brulee and a puff thing that I have no idea what it was called but it was damn good.

I'm not sure I liked this buffet enough to pay the single visit price and wait in the usually long line. I had purchased the ""Buffet of Buffets"" deal, so it was worth it in this case. 

The food is very good, service was great. As soon as I went up for dessert, a staff member came by and offered me coffee. It's like she read my mind.

The last 2 years I went, the food wasn't quite as good as it used to be.  There are still items that were good.  The prime rib wasn't overcooked, which is great and rare for buffets.  The frozen vanilla custard was delicious.

The made to order crepes are just okay.  They batter isn't that great, and resembles pancake batter.  I like my crepes a little crispier.  Also, I don't like how they put the nutella on the outside, and they put way too much chocolate sauce, so you can't even taste the nutella.

This place specializes in French cuisine, so when you think French, you think amazing breads and cheeses, right?  The bread is always old tasting and lackluster.  It is so disappointing.

As for the crabs-- they are typical fair, except they are cold and hard to open.I prefer warm crab claws.

I prefer this place for breakfast over dinner and lunch.  The selection it pretty good for breakfast.  The Eggs Benedict was way over cooked, and the English Muffin underneath was soggy.  I had one of the muffins, and it was the most disgusting muffing I've ever had.  But they had some good items including a nice assortments of eggs, an omelet station, savory crepes made to order, etc...

Day: In my opinion, eating at Le Village for breakfast is what you should be aiming for. They're breakfast crepes, and omelets are wonderfully scrumptious! I always choose to eat here in the morning because, 1) the line isn't long (probably a 30 minute wait), and 2) the atmosphere in here is great. Oh gosh, I just love their french toast with maple syrup! Yum. The waffles at this buffet are more soft and moist than all the others in Vegas. In addition, I believe Le Village Buffet serves the best creme brulee in the strip. When you eat it in the morning, it's just like heaven. What a perfect way to start the day!

Night: I am not such a big fan of this buffet at night. I'd rather go to Rio, Planet Hollywood or Caesar's Palace to eat. At this buffet, it lacks the savory the food needs, not to mention that there is not a lot of choices for food here. The way they makes their crepes at night is too...overwhelming. I remembered waiting 15 mins in the line and I got a gigantic stuffed crepe that didn't even taste good. I feel like I was eating a blob of dough with chocolate and over-sweeten fruits. That really ruined my appetite. I don't think I ever ate their crepes at night again after that. It;s nowhere near their morning crepes. I guess it all depends on the person who makes them

My biggest criticism is that nothing I had was hot - only warm at best.  I had:
*   Eggs Benedict.  Fair English muffin, good Canadian bacon; eggs properly cooked.
*   Croissant.  Good for a buffet, but not nearly as good as at Bouchon.
*   Lyonnaise potatoes.  Disappointing.  Bland; very little onion flavor.
*   Country sausage.  In many ways, like the link sausage you can get at any pancake house - but done right.  Very good flavor and texture.
*   Veal sausage and onions.  Smooth texture, mild flavor, executed nicely.
*   Andouille grilled sausage.  Short, fat sausage in a chewy casing.  Strong grilled flavor, coarse, slightly sweet, slightly spicy.
*   Smoked fish (unknown type): hard and chewy, with a strong, smoky flavor; not too salty.
*   Pain au chocolat.  OK bun, but with very little chocolat.  Fair to good.
*   Cinnamon bun.  Strong cinnamon flavor, not too sweet.
*   Nondescript cookie.  Fair.
*   Pastry.  A flat dense, cakey pastry with slivered almonds and white icing.  Inside, a layer of marzipan.

But buffets and hangover do not blend very well. I was a bit miserable buffet-hopping in the day time. It sucks many of the mom n pop pho shops or dim sum restaurants are not located on the strip. It is taken over by the bigger businesses owned by the hotels, otherwise they would have great business. We started off at Le Village at noon, the line was a bit long for a 3-star buffet. I would expect Wynn or Bellagio would be ridiculous, but  nevertheless it went by quick, especially if you have large parties. There is a service\/gratuity charge if your party exceeds 7. There were 7 of us so we made the cut! (huzzah!)

Since it is located in the Paris Hotel, many food were French inspired like French toast, crepes, Eggs Benedict. I tried to make the most of my buck, but buffets and I don't get along since I eat very little portions. We chose the buffet-hop for the experience since some of my friends really wanted to try as many buffets as possible.

5 years ago, I loved this place. 2 years ago I liked this place. This month....ehhhhh it was ok.  There used to be dishes like beef bourguignon, and coq au vin which made this a unique experience. Lots and lots and lots of different grilled veggies too and great salads. This time around, significantly less veggies (yes I know a lot of people don't go to buffets for veggies), and neither of my favorite dishes. This time around the food seemed like the stuff you find at any other buffet...nothing unique, and the quality was just ok.  The duck was dry. 

People really seem to love the abundance of crab legs, and that may be my problem...I don't really eat crab. But the abundance is definitely there for those that are interested.

There are still long lines, and still less than personable service (but nothing overtly rude...just ok).  The desserts have expanded a bit over the years, but they were just ok.  Wicked Spoon across the street had better (according to the partner who loves desserts, but also cares about the taste more than the presentation).   

The price is a bit lower than say the Bellagio, so all in all probably not a bad deal. I'd go early though at the dinner hour, to avoid the ridiculously long line...you'll just have the semi-ridiculously long line.

They had some fake rustic decorations but I suppose no one is really looking around while they're busy shoveling food into their mouths.

There is the standard meat station, crepe station, seafood (crab legs!), salad\/fruit, some random sushi, pastas, and a crap-ton of breakfast food randomly spread out across all the stations. Service was slightly shoddy as the meat carver disappeared for a while and my waitress never brought me me orange juice. However the food overall was quite tasty. The crepe station was popular (don't get the savory crepes, it's never warmed up quite right inside the crepe) because of the freshly made crepes. The prime rib slab was HUGE and I ended up sharing with my friends. The eggs benedict was quite tasty, as well as the ham quiche\/tart thing. All the breakfast foods were good, not great.

Shining star for me was the dessert station. So many varieties I couldn't make up my mind. I made a few rounds before I saw one of the workers roll in a huge cart full of creme brulees.

We asked our waiter if we could have a second one because the group of 10 next to us received seconds from their waitress but our waiter told us only limit one.

Basically he said you can visit ALL of the Caesar resorts buffets as much as you want for 24 hrs. We though this was an amazing deal, we could have lunch at the Paris, dinner at Caesar's, and breakfast somewhere else all for $50 dollars!

We purchased our wrist bands at Paris and the woman said ""Yes, this is good at ALL Caesar's resorts."" We went to have dinner at Caesar's later that day and after checking in with the hostess she said ""oh, you know you have to pay an ADDITONAL $30 per person, right?"" WHAT?! What a total rip off. We should have known the ""good deal"" was too good to be true. They stamp a little thing on the back of your receipt stating ""pay as little as $15 for upgrade to Caesars buffet."" Who bothers to read the fine print on the back of a receipt? If we would have known it would have been extra, we would have never bothered. We also wouldn't have had to walk my 74 year old father clear across the strip for all the trouble. Paris didn't offer to do anything to rectify the confusion, and I really feel bad for other people falling for this ""deal."" 

All that being said, The Paris buffet had some good things to it in regards to food:

The brioche French toast, the salmon, roasted sweet potatoes, the pasta dishes were all favorites. 

Some not so good:
Lack of fresh fruit and veggies - the salad offerings were very poor. 
The crepe station...the ""bananas"" on the nutella crepes were mushy and weird, swimming in some sweet mystery liquid and then drenched in whipped topping and lord knows what else.

The food is served out of little storefronts that each represent one of the provinces of France and feels as if you are really eating in a cute little French village. Our table was actually situated ""outside"" a small house so it felt like dining al fresco without the bother of bugs or dirt.

The food itself is amazing. Not all of it is French, but the dishes that are not are pretty seamlessly integrated. For example, there were a couple of Italian dishes at the Provence station, but because Provence borders Italy that made sense and didn't distract from the overall theme. For me, the crepe station and the dessert section were by far and away the best parts of the meal. The crepe chef made both sweet and savory varieties. I had one with mushrooms, cheese, and spinach that was to die for. As for the desserts, 90% of them are french classics such as creme brulee. That's right, all you can eat creme brulee.

The pricing gets a little expensive. A basic adult buffet is around $30 dollars, but you can add on an extra $12 for all you can drink beer and wine (dinner) and champagne and mimosas (brunch\/breakfast). You can also pay an extra $10 to jump the line.

The line to get in is also something worth mentioning. If you are in any kind of hurry splurge on the line jump. The line moves relatively quickly, but even on a weeknight it took my husband and I a good 45 minutes to get through it.

As a last note, if you are in the mood to splurge a little, I highly recommend getting the Paris Balloon Cocktail. All it is is your choice of a margarita, daiquiri, or pina colada served in a ceramic glass shaped like the balloon that serves as Paris's logo. The drink was expensive, but the bartender put in enough rum to get both my husband and I buzzing.",0,0,0

Here are a few (hopefully useful) comments and tips about this place:

1. The groupon is a big time money saver. I think each groupon was $44 (not including tax\/tip obviously) and it included admission for 2 plus a bottle of wine. The wine isn't included usually but they were serving some complimentary wine while we were there. I don't know if they do that every night.

2. Get in line for the prime rib. It was soooooo good. I am pretty sure I had about half a pound of meat while we were in there. Delicious.

3. Just like in any buffet, dont fill up on carbs\/salads. 

4. The rest of the food was slightly to salty for my taste but overall it was still pretty good.

5. If you do get the groupon (and the bottle of wine), do not order their cab. That thing tasted like vinegar. Luckily there were 4 of us in our party so we have some chardonnay as well. The white wine was surprisingly smooth. Next time we'll get 2 bottles of that.

Overall pretty good buffet. The food was good, service was good, and the location inside the Paris couldn't have been better.

The only reason I wouldn't go back would be for a lack of groupon. I think there are better options at $40 pp.",1,0,0

The buffet is broken up into multiple stations, each offering different regional French fair.  There are obviously your standard breakfast items available, but the more abstract items really drew our attention.

They have $10 bottles of wine (yeah it was breakfast, what of it?) and a great crepe station.

I highly recommend this buffet for breakfast.",1,0,1

I liked the egg benedict and the waffles. They also had many different choices of breakfast meat (like 3-4 different types of sausages, bacon, ham, etc). They also had many types of egg dishes (like the fritata, scrambles). They also had many choices of bread, muffins selections.

The service was very timely and the waiter that helped us was always available and cleaning the plates as patrons finished them. The selection of food was good as well. Plenty of options for all different palates. I enjoyed the truffle Mac and cheese, crab legs (no butter for some reason), and the chicken de provance. The pastry chef made excellent macarons and creme brûlée. The crepes were awesome too, they had both savory and sweet options.

Ohhhh yeah. Mmmhhmmm. That's right, we did this buffet style!!! Best believe.  

I'm pretty sure my husband was relieved to see that I did not morph into Bridezilla during the months leading up to our wedding day.  Truth be known, I'm pretty easy to please.  I didn't need the eleborate bells and whistles on my wedding day.  I wanted it to be fun, unpretentious and memorable. Plain and simple.  

So what better way to please the 90 nearest and dearest friends and family members that made it out to Vegas than to treat them to a meal buffet-style after the ceremony in the Paris Hotel chapel.  It was only $25 a head and there were LOADS and LOADS of food options to choose from.  Forget about the glitz and glamour of a 3 course meal.  No worries on having to add Meat, Fish or Chicken check boxes on our RSVP cards.  I wanted my guests to feel like they could grub on their own terms.  And believe me - the hubby and I both come from families that take food SERIOUSLY.  Our families love food.  So the option of people heading for seconds (and thirds, fourths...) was a plus.  Being that it was the Paris hotel, the menu echoed of French dishes. The food was amazingly delicious for a buffet!   They were even able to provide us with a private section of the restaurant just for our party.  The decor was breathtaking - the ceilings were painted to look like a bright blue sky with puffs of white clouds.  The floors mimicked cobblestone sidewalks and the buffet stations were made to look like old French houses.   Each ""Station"" showcased food from the 6 different regions of France.They were also able to provide our awesome 3 tier wedding cake (vanilla cake with fresh berries) and champagne for the toast.    We received nothing but praises from our guests on how outstanding the food was.  

I had to go to Vegas for business during the summer of '07 and I took my husband with me.  Where did we stop for our first meal? Uh huh, Le Village Buffet.  We heard so much about the awesome Breakfast\/Brunch buffet that they had, we had to give it a go.  And it was sooooo worth it.

That is to say, it was quite long.  But I had a taste for crepes and the menu display on the LCD screen told me this was going to be worth the wait.  And maybe no matter what time you go, there's always a wait for this place.

Succulent prime rib, pork with this chutney sauce that sang to me between bites, crispy bacon, quiche lorraine, and let's not forget the crepes that brought me there in the first place!  Oh, and the champagne?  Endless.  My bf decided it was too dry for his taste, so I downed both our flutes and kept doing so until even I agreed it was time to cut me off.

a ""what?! I didn't post this yet?"" review
=============================

Ah, mon amis, Le Village?  C'est tres magnifique... !

Even if you don't speak French (I haven't retained a lick of 3 years of H.S. French aside from ""do you speak English?"" and ""would you go to bed with me?""), I'm sure you're fluent enough in ""foodie"" to understand... 

Located in the opulent Paris Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, Le Village is my favorite buffet amongst the ""big"" hotels, rivaled closely by the monstrosity of a buffet over at Bellagio (of course, I am just another wh0rish tourist, so what do I know... Hi, Vegas Yelpers!!) and a Vegas junket just isn't complete until we've brunch'd here.

Just steps away from the cobblestone path, under a painted sky, you'll find a low-lit French village facade representing a general culinary summation of five French provinces.  It's a kitschy-cute setting, cottages crafted and modeled with a little cartoon-iness which is either endearing (a la Disney's ""It's A Small World"") or will make you kvetch (also a la Disney's ""It's A Small World"")...

Because of the French theme and focus to regional namesakes, the offerings at Le Village are prepared with a modicum of practice and expertise, achieving, I assume, a notable reflection and taste of common French dishes (though, not being astute to the nuances of French cuisine, I could be blissfully ignorantly wrong!).  Creme sauces, wine reductions, puffed pastries, and savory dishes aplenty!  For lighter\/smaller appetites, there is a [regrettably unremarkable] salad bar, chilled seafood bar, a selection of cheeses, and a pastry bar, though these seem a bit like an afterthought in comparison to the entree areas.  Peach (apricot?) Duck.  Lamb Cheek Stew.  Scallops.  Etcetera etcetera!!

So, if you're going to have single all-day-sustaining, pre-drunken state, $20-some-odd-number, ""let's buffet because we're in Vegas"" meal... I'd consider Le Village...

Meat lover?  You may want to try another dining locale.

Mmm...this place was awesome.  I'm not normally a fan of buffets- usually there's just too many different types of foods that my stomach can't handle all at once.  So the fact that I was able to eat here (and eat LOTS), and not be totally sick afterwards is a good thing.  

They had a decent variety of meat, none of which looked too appealing.  Honestly, I like meat, but I would be in just as much heaven with pasta and veggies.  Probably why I liked it so much here- every vegetable dish was cooked 'til perfectly tender and thoroughly slathered in butter and garlic.  In my book, that's definitely the way to go.  Heart attack city disguised in greens and other leafy matter.  Similarly, being an Italian stuck in an Asian body, the pasta dishes were amazing, covered in lots of oh-so-yummy marinara sauce (my fave).

Try the sauteed mushrooms.  Try the grilled Roma tomatoes.  HEAVEN.  

Also of worthy note- $2 fabulous looking (and tasting!) mimosas and $5 also fabulous looking (and tasting!) bloody marys.  

The restaurant itself has a nice feel to it- outdoorsy-ish and set to look like Paris (or what I imagine Paris would look like).  Cobblestone is always a nice touch.

As of October 2013, Le Village is the only buffet in Vegas that offers reservations through Open Table.  When you have a reservation, you by pass the line and go through a separate entrance parlor that is also used by Total Rewards Platinum and Diamond members.   Waiting in line for 30 minutes to an hour for a buffet really stinks but with our reservation, we didn't wait at all!  And we were 15 minutes late for our reserved time.  One member of our party had Platinum status so it allowed us to use the special check in desk even if we hadn't had a reservation.  It also enabled us to be seated in a special area where we received special service.  What ""special service"" might you ask?  Our server was extra friendly but the great thing is that she offered to bring us steamed crab legs to our table!  At Le Village, the ""common people"" schlep up to the buffet line to help themselves and pick through the crab legs which are served cold.  Unlike at Bacchanal, where you can request the crab legs to be boiled and served hot, Le Village doesn't offer warm steamed crab legs except for the ""status"" diners.  And she brought hot bowl after bowl of hot juicy crab legs until we begged her to stop!  Being brought crab legs directly to your table elevates a buffet dining experience beyond the normal and makes dining so much more enjoyable.  After having gorged on so many crab legs, we only had enough room leftover to sample a few other dishes.  The only reason that I don't give Le Village 5 stars is because the selection of dishes doesn't rival that of Bacchanal.  But I actually did enjoy the crab legs better at Le Village because they were brought to our table and also they are not salty, unlike at Bacchanal.

Aside from the food, we also loved the slightly kitschy atmosphere of the French village.  The macarons and other desserts were very good (albeit not a huge variety like Bacchanal) and instead of standard soft serve, they offer frozen custard, which has a slightly different texture and richer taste.

At the end of our meal, our server brought to our table of 5 people 10 chocolate bar lollipops shaped like the Eiffel Tower, 5 dark chocolate and 5 white chocolate.  We later saw these identical treats in a gift shop in the hotel for $3.50 each! 

I'd highly recommend getting Platinum status so that you can enjoy the benefits!  If you don't want to gamble a lot to earn your status, you can instantly get Platinum status if you apply for and get approved for the Total Rewards credit card.",5,0,1

I almost feel bad having to give them a one-star, but I realize there are no zero stars! 

The only good thing about the place was our waitress, and our cold beer.  The food was less than average, the selection was minimal. But the reason for my one star is the following:
At 1:00 p.m., which is about 90 minutes into lunch buffet, there were almost discarded trays of desserts from the breakfast buffet, with labels indicating completely different food items. Patrons were walking into food set-up areas to get desserts which were there waiting to be placed in windows for long long time. I would never condone such behavior, but I do understand why. We had to flag down a manager to show them.  I am not referring to one spot, or one tray. The whole area of desserts... 

This is in the Paris Hotel, in Vegas. I had been there few years back, and it was phenomenal. What happened? I expect more, and by that I don't mean more food, but more organization, and just decent presentation of food.

Yet another meal in Vegas where you'll wait in line to get in for no damned good reason:  plenty of available tables, and yet a handful of hostesses who shuffle back and forth doing nothing in particular, looking at a computer console at the hostess station, ignoring parties waiting to be seated, then shuffling off again.

It was about 2:15 in the afternoon.  We paid $30 for the ""champagne brunch"" that was running until 3 p.m.  The crowd was dwindling; there were many open tables, but we still waited (why?) for the indifferent hostesses to shuffle over and be bothered to seat us.  We were well into eating what we'd collected from the buffet on our first trip through before a waitress came by to take drink orders.  They don't bring you water unless you order it.

Food was pretty good, by my estimation.  I got a decent slab of prime rib; not too rare, not too fatty, yet still tender.  Mussels were slightly overcooked, but overall capably done.  The potatoes au gratin had just been refreshed as I arrived; and they were excellent.  The crepe bar was good enough, though the crepe itself was a bit flavorless and tasted as though it had come from a boxed mix.  Vegetables near the prime rib station could have used another minute of cooking, but were respectable.  The crab legs were fresh and still plump and appetizing.  Pasta dishes were a little mushy and overcooked.  The mini crème brulees were a pleasure, with flecks of real vanilla bean and a tasty, crisp, caramelized sugar crust.  The fruit selection at the salad bar was disappointing and thin.

But the service really needs to wake the hell up to be worth $30.  A waitress had just brought us refills of Pepsi before we got up to make our 2nd run through the buffet.  We deliberately put our flatware off to one side so that whoever was collecting our empty plates would leave it alone.  When we got back, plates, flatware, and Pepsis were all gone.  Yes, somebody had taken away our freshly-refilled sodas.  Why?  Beats me.  Our original waitress had gone off shift while we were at the buffet for Round 2, and the new one could not be less interested in bringing us replacement flatware.  There are no place settings or utensils available on the buffet, just plates.  So we rummaged in some drawers in a buffet storage\/credenza in the dining room behind us, and grabbed our own forks and knives.",0,0,0

Because I'm one of those cheap and uncouth buffet goers, I can't say I'm a complete fan.  Their seafood options are really just cooked mussels and clams, plus the usual cocktail shrimp.  I didn't get to fist pump the air like I cheated the system after downing a plate and a half of bivalve molluscs.  It's just not as satisfying as a plate of crab legs.

It was $24.99 for brunch.  The wait was long but the food was ok.  I like from a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 6, compared to the Wynn which I give a 9.  A lot of their food lacked flavor.  The line was long and the dessert bar SUCKED!  I love dessert, and it is a 3 compared to the Wynn which i give a 10.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Taste wise, I did not care for it.  Our waitress was great, she was very busy, but she tried to keep up with our needs especially the mimosa refills, which I guess was the only good thing about the buffet because it was included and non stop refills.  I would have given this place a 3 star except for the situation that happened while we were waiting for a table.  Originally we had 4 people for the buffet, and a few of our friends joined us and it turned into 9.  Which after waiting for an hour and a half in line, we didn't want to wait for a larger table.  There was a large group in front of us maybe about 20 before we got there and they waited for a while for a table.  So we decided that we were going to split into 2 groups since we weren't going to leave the restaurant at the same time anyways.  So we told our waitress that we wanted to go from 9 people into 2 groups of 4 and 5.  Well, when we told her that she got mad, but we weren't even next in line for a table.  We were maybe about 10 people behind being next.  So we did ask if we can get seated near each other if possible but when we told her, Marta the hostess got all mad at us and started giving us dirty looks.  We were then seated and a few minutes later my friends that met us up there were seated as well, they were seated on the opposite side of the restaurant where there was another table that was vacant the whole entire time they were there even before they were seated.  So Marta could have seated us together but she didn't and while we were eating the whole time she kept giving us dirty looks.  We later realized that if it was a party of 8 people or more the gratuity charge is 18%.  So we were given bad service with dirty looks because our hostess wasn't going to get the 18% gratuity charge.  I have been to Rio and the Wynn's buffet, and never at any of the other two buffets had we had bad service due to a gratuity charge.  Like I said you get what you pay for.  And another thing that I almost forgot to mention if you are looking for the omelet station, look at the dessert bar, because it's not near where the savory food is, but if you are looking for the crepe bar, it is next to where the savory food are and oh don't get banana's for your crepe, because they are brown and mushy.",1,0,0

We were seated in an appropriate manner that didn't take too long, thank goodness. We got tables for 6 in an almost room like area where it was slightly closed off, which made it a little quieter.

FOOD: I don't remember anything that stood out, had the usual meat slices and mashed potatoes and vegetables. I also had the shrimp cocktail which were relatively fresh with a good crunch, the cocktail sauce itself tasted really weird almost like medicine. I was really grossed out by it, definitely didn't get seconds on that. They were all pretty meh, I only ended up having two plates of food.

I have eaten here twice, the first time by choice, the second time I was talked into it. I tried to sample a bit of everything that looked appealing. I tried probably 25-30 very small portions of what they had to offer. This is how I like to work the buffets, and if there is anything I really like I go get more. Nothing was even so-so. Nothing tasted horrid, it was all just bland, boring and immediately forgettable. Also, some of the items resembled french food and even used their names like coq au vin, etc. But in reality, the food resembled French food about as much as the Hotel really resembles Paris. Feels more like Disneyland than France by a long shot. 

My advice, go to the Bellagio, Wynn or even The Buffet at the M. They are all far superior and you will have a much happier ending to your meal. Au revoir!

The food was quite tasty, and I enjoyed everything I ate. I could easily give this place 5 stars except for the price ($35 on weekends). It's clearly to account for the more expensive items such as crab legs, which I don't really enjoy. If that's the reason you're going to a Vegas buffet, go to the Bellagio because they have more meaty and easier to eat crab legs.

The decore, which I assume is to be similar to a Paris street, but it's a bit cheesy.

Over the many years of having so many people talk about Vegas buffets being the best, I had to try at least once while I was there. I had so many expectations but maybe that's the problem here. 

First off, we were seated almost a block away from the actual food stations. This place really makes you work for the food. The food is sectioned off into several stations based on the courses (appetizers, main and dessert). I always go for the seafood and meats....you figured you get your money's worth that way. Seriously who wants to get full on cheap salads?

I got a little bit of everything. I'm a dabbler. The meats were salty and dry. The seafood was just okay. I didn't even touch the salads. But their coffee was good. Overall I felt there wasn't much love put into the food. It was all about quantity versus quality while I'd much prefer the latter. There is something about buffets that makes people pile on everything even the food is awful. I am guilty of this but I ended up not eating 80% of what I had on my plate.

As my evening was not turning out as expected, I decided to try their crepe station. Per recommendation from my friend, I got their nutella, bananas and hazelnuts. I have to say that dish made up for everything else I had before there. It was freshly made infront of me, so how can anyone mess that up? 

Now that all the glitz and glamour is gone.....it would take a lot for me to come back to this place again.",8,2,2

Creme brulee had been torched prettily, but was not crisp by the time I had mine.

Went back for breakfast...not sure why.  It was terrible.  Soggy tarts from the night before, lots of heavy American food.  The corned beef hash tasted like it had rotted a bit.  Also would hate for anyone to think the gummy little crepe wrapper was anything like the real thing.

Several types of eggs and potatoes along with bacon, sausage, mini French toasts, mini pancakes, croissants, muffins, bagels, fruit, etc... is what they had.

The shellfish wasn't too great, and I'm a little sad I wasted precious stomach space on them. Focaccia roll? Nice and chewy. Roast mushrooms? Perfectly seasoned. Tri-tip? Nice and pink in the middle. Buffet food is typically pretty meh, but how can you miss out on a Vegas buffet? This was one of the better buffets I've been to during the last 10 years. $15 well spent.

Round 2: http:\/\/i92.photobucket.com\/albums\/l18\/AyJee\/IMG_6996.jpg
More mushrooms! Caesar salad + plain romaine (pre-mixed salads are often so heavy on the dressing!), creamed spinach + artichoke (YUM), sole, marinated tomato and mozzarella balls. 

My tips would be to go easy on the pasta, get the duck and roast beef, get veggies (minus the asparagus), and don't get shellfish.  The fish is alright, the mediterranean section's got great sauces (pesto aioli! :D), and SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT!

But wait wait a minute Gerald isn't the dinner buffet including taxes cost about $32 per person? Yes it does. Being a Total Rewards Card Member I was eligible to redeem $25 on food. I redeemed that amount and paid the difference of the buffet. Please note my review below isn't normally written for someone that paid the regular price, but someone who paid just $7 for dinner.

The layout of food of this buffet is about one-fourth smaller than Bacchanal Buffet. However for this buffet my approach was similar to Bacchanal Buffet - get small portions on the plate. My goal was at least to get 7 plates so that I would only pay $1 per plate. I won't list all the items I ate, but I will highlight the items that stood out. The lamb leg, which is very French, wasn't gamey but flavorable because of the herbs. Since yesterday was St. Patrick's Day corned beef was served. Classical French dishes like pork and beans cassoulet and sausage and bratwurst choucroute garnie reminded me of dishes at Les Halles in New York. This buffet has a crepe station where your can order different types of crepes. Pork belly with apples is a classical French country dish. In the end I didn't end up getting seven plates of dishes; I got nine. A calculation that results in less than $1 per plate. You can say I got my monies worth.

Whereas most buffets display random items of food, this buffet stands out because there are dishes from different regions of France. These regions act as a food station. When you go to a Chinese Food buffet you can tell the buffet is Chinese because of the food that is served. At this buffet you can tell the food is French because of the regional food station.

Overall this is a decent buffet. In terms of quality and abundance of items this buffet isn't up to par with Bacchanal Buffet. However this buffet is much better in terms of quality and unique items than those Chinese buffets in the suburbs. You still be stuffed at this buffet, but you won't feel bloated as other Chinese buffets.

http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/spice-market-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:1QcL6C8Ik11As2dojg5xXw

From past experiences, there was always a long wait for the Le Village buffet, so I decided to see if they take reservations and to my surprise, they actually do!

We were seated rather quickly and the place didn't seem to be as busy as they were in the past (thus the Groupon deal I assume) This particular deal included a bottle of wine of Chard, Cab or Merlot. Unlike the deal at the Spice Market, which offered Miller beer (WTH?), I thought a bottle of wine is a bit classier, so I opted for Merlot. Not wanting to be drunk at lunch time, I was happy to learn though they were required to open the bottle, it was a screw cap and we're allowed to take the rest when we leave.

Considering it was a screw cap and a freebie, it actually wasn't too bad. As for the food, the selection was not nearly as plentiful as say Rio, or Studio B (M Hotel) but the quality was evident. Their prime rib was perfect, red, slight bloodiness and had a nice seasoned crust with just the right amount of fat. That was the highlight. All other dishes were very good also. The items were well stocked and kept hot. 

The crepes were amazing as each was big enough to fill me up. Their dessert selection was much more impressive than the Spice Market (95% cupcakes) Le Village offered macarons, which is very appropriate for being inside Paris. But the one that were served like a lollipop (on a stick) were dry and crumbly, and tasted stale. 

Overall, it was a better experience than when I went many years ago. Perhaps since they weren't swamped like before, the quality of food and service didn't suffer.

We went to the buffet for lunch and it included a pretty good selection of items from grilled vegetables to fresh crepes to some other French-like items that I did not eat (because I was only eating vegetarian and seafood items at the time).

And, that's where things went wrong:  the seafood.  While things like the seafood stew were excellent, the mussels in garlic were extremely briny and tough.  Half of the time, I was tasting sand rather than mussel.

Other than that, I'd say the buffet is definitely worth it, especially since lunchtime is such a great deal (at least compared to the other pricier buffets).

Honestly, I don't know what was the hold up with the line.  As I was waiting with my group, I looked up on Yelp and when I saw people saying they were waiting in line for over an hour, I judged the length of my line and thought maybe 20 minutes tops.  Boy, was I wrong.  They were seating a party about every 3 minutes.  I'll give them the benefit and say that it was probably due to their limited seating, and hope that it is not simply the staff's inefficiency. 

The offerings at the buffet itself were not very 'French' as per the assumed theme this buffet was projecting.  Most of the spoon handles had been in use for too long (and looked like they were given to a teething infant for a few hours and felt just as sticky as you can imagine).   The food that those instruments dished up was bland, and not very appealing.

I will say our server kept on top of our drinks (non-alcoholic), but missed the plates.  The whole staff just seemed over-loaded by the crowds and like they had never experienced such an amount of patrons in their restaurant at a time.  Really confused as to what this was all about since our server mentioned to us that this happens all the time.  Well, then prepare for it a little more!

As stated previously, totally not worth your wait in line.  While you're waiting there, look over the reviews of the Bellagio buffet, and if you can cough up a few dollars more, ditch this line and head across the street.  You'll be glad you did, trust me.",0,0,0

We had a $25 food voucher so we thought we would give a shot. I'm sorry to say we made a mistake. The food was horrible. 

The cashier was not friendly. Usually, I walk away when people are being weird, but we really wanted to do a buffet and we were hungry. We waited in line for about 10 minutes before we were seated. 

Our server was really nice. We knew it was busy, so we asked her to bring double the drinks. I had 2 cups of water, boyfriend had 2 cups of coke. That way we eliminate the need to wait for her when we get thirsty. 

I always walk around first so I can see what the options are. Everything smelled and looked good. I could hardly wait. I grabbed some sushi rolls, I got a savory mushroom crepe, pasta, and shrimp cocktail. The sushi roll was chewy, the crepe wasn't cooked long enough, the pasta was dry, and my shrimp cocktail was soggy, like soggy bread soggy. I asked my boyfriend to bring me a cut of prime rib since he was going. It was dry. 

At this point, I'm not happy, but I saw the dessert and it looked delicious. I grabbed macaroons, creme burlee, and flan. The macaroons were way too sweet. They tasted like when you roll cotton candy into a tiny ball with your fingers, you know what I'm talking about. The flan was flavorless. The only thing I liked was the creme burlee, but it was very eggy. 

This is the worst buffet I have been to in Las Vegas. I've been to the one in Luxor, MGM, Wynn, and Harrahs. At least at those other buffets, you can find something that is really good. I couldn't believe that everything was bad here. I'm still searching for a really good buffet in Vegas.",0,1,1

I searched to see if it has been remodeled since I was last there and I cannot find any info saying so, so I'm assuming that it is the same since I last went there.

My brother came to visit from out of town and for some reason he heard that this place was good and wanted to try it out. Being a local, I'm rarely impressed with what the strip casino buffets offer compared to the local casinos because they all pretty much serve the same foods but the strip buffets are twice as expensive and twice as crowded. In this case both still stand true. 

First off, the wait to get in was about an hour and a half! Luckily I wasn't the one that had to wait in line so I just went to the casino and played while I waited for his call. Finally after an hour and a half he hit the front of the line and it was finally time to eat. 

The first thing I noticed was the layout and design of the buffet. It is supposed to look like some French street market or whatever and there's the main dining floor which had like cobblestone paths or whatever and there were like little ""rooms"" on the sides which was where we were seated. It's a horrible theme and completely bad layout. The rooms looked like little village shops or something and had space for about 4 tables with about 20 seats or so but it's just a horrible design. My biggest complain about that is that if all of those walls were knocked down and all of the rooms were eliminated, they could probably seat another 200 people at any given time, which would alleviate, the wait in the line but getting more people in at once. I could see the rooms being a nifty little idea, especially if you're filling up that room with your own party but when there's 5 other parties in there, it's not so great. The rooms are somewhat isolated and are fairly quiet and it's not so fun hearing the other family's kids yelling and not having the buzz of the restaurant drowning it out. 

The food

The food was nothing nothing special really. I honestly don't remember much about the food. It wasn't anything different than what I could have gotten from a local casino but for half the price. I think the cost was like $40 per person for a dinner buffet and for what we got, it was not worth it at all. 
 
One thing I do remember is that the flow of the buffet was not good. People just kept cutting in front of me and had no clue on where the flow of the buffet line was and every time I went up to the buffet, I would come back aggravated and annoyed with how much side stepping I had to do to get from point a to point b.

Today, I met some friends from the East who I was taking hiking at Mount Charleston and we decided to have breakfast here.  It was a good choice.

We were there when it opened at 7 AM, and we were the first at the omelette\/fresh egg station.  I got an omelette made with mushrooms, spinach, jalapeños, and cheese.  The omelette was quickly done by the cook and it was very good.  I also had a few slices of bacon.  It was not crisp nor limp but somewhere in between.  Now it was time for dessert.

I walked over to the crèpe section.  I studied the list of crèpes and decided on the second one, the crèpe made with fresh strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries.  The cook poured the batter, spread it around the griddle with his little crèpe plow, evening out the batter so it was a thin pancake on the griddle.  He turned it and then filled it with the fruit listed above.  After folding it expertly, he topped it with some fresh whipped cream and then spread some raspberry coulis on the whipped cream.  The crèpe was so hot, the whipped cream slid off as I walked back to the table.

After all, the French are masters in the kitchen, right? $24.99? That's a deal!

What I really liked about this buffet is that they have many types of foods based on the different regions of France. For instance, you can get some food items originating from Burgundy or Alsace. However, I was confused when I found a buffet table that had hummus, sushi and sweet potatoes next to each other. I hope they have changed the way they organize their food station and remember that they are making French food. On another note, the stuffed baked tomatoes were good and I fairly much enjoyed their pasta dishes and crab legs. The ham and the meat station, for you carnivores out there, is a must! The meat is tender, juicy and flavorful. They do have a small section of salad and fruit. 

The crepes to order were okay, I was not very impressed at the selection of toppings and I ended up decorating my plate, my mother's plate and another guest's plate when they saw me making the crepe look somewhat presentable. The batter seemed too thin and so the crepe was more like a pizzelle cookie at the end, except semi-soft. 

They do have a desert station that you can go and browse around, but I recommend staying away from the creme caramel or flan. Definitely needs some flavor improvement there. I heard the creme brulee was pretty good though.

After my parents enrolled the silver rewards card, we have a free buffet coupon offer to dine in some participating casinos, so we were excited to enjoy this incredible offer by trying this place out!

As we entered Le Village, the atmosphere is quite confusing, yet in a French village ways. The concept remains the same as the main casino lobby does. We got the table on time at the VIP area as the server followed us to find a great table spot.

The service has done a great job for serving the customers accordingly. No problems or issues at all!

Now onto the entrees choice for me! My first plate entree is the simple dinner meal which I picked. There are: steamed broccoli and cauliflower, seasoned Brussels sprouts, cooked prime ribs, premium quality macaroni and cheese, baked salmon, and baked talipia. So far, my plate went well! The veggies has done a top notch including the baked talipia and Mac n cheese. The prime ribs however runs a little dry in my opinion, so I placed it a jus sauce and it worked well. The baked salmon cooked excellent, yet sometimes it has some bone in leftovers inside as I chew it slowly.

My second plate choice: more dinner meal which includes leg of lamb, baked talipia (again,) seashell shaped pesto pasta, sweet potatoes, and spinach dip over chopped potatoes. This plate went good! The leg of lamb works like a charm which enhances the natural flavor a of the lamb. The rest of the plate worked well for me, so I have no issues at all!

Finally, to conclude my buffet plate: is the dessert choice. I picked up at the crepe aisle where you can choose any crepe you want from sweet to savory. I chose the 3 berries crepe drizzled with raspberry sauce, and so far, it tasted delicious! The crepe cooking methods cooked very well along with the ingredients too! Very yummy, sweetly crepe I've ever eaten in years!

In the end, Le Village at Paris Casino and Hotel is a great, wonderful buffet right here in Las Vegas Blvd Strip. Perfect for date nights, or friends\/family gatherings! A well, worthy visit!",20,11,15

I thought they had an eclectic mix as opposed to your typical buffet with pork belly, chicken caccitorie and beef bourgurgmon served in miniature iron skillets.  Bellagio's pastas are better, but Paris is a close second.  I dunno if I ran across a Vegas buffet that serves lamb, but Paris does.  I didn't really venture off to the salad bar because I opted for the spinach & artichoke as well as some of the steamed vegetables.

The desserts are pretty similar to Bellagio & Wynn, but hopefully you had enough of the main selection to not even think of heading in that direction.

I've been reading a number of the reviews on here, and not a lot of positive is being said about it, but for some reason, when a group of 6 of us made our way into the Le Village Buffet.. the Prime Rib was the toast of the table.  It was juicy, succulent, and would fall apart just by cutting it with the side of your fork.  Also, we checked out Prime Rib at the buffets at both the Rio and Planet Hollywood and they paled in comparison.

The selection here was not 'worldly,' but it did offer a variety of good desserts and there were a number of vegetarian options for those in our party that had to avoid the meaty goodness.

Another standout was the omelette bar, which had a ton of options and really was surprisingly good.

I felt absolutely cheated paying a buffet price for the amount of food I ate. My husband booked some discount-price tickets to this place, so we went there for dinner one night during our Vegas vacation. 

There are different stations, like any buffet, where you can get different kinds of food, most of it European. I tried really hard to like the food. Not much of it looked appetizing. Even less of it tasted that way. 

Shrimp and crab legs are my go-to items for Las Vegas buffets. They're usually safe, right? Well, the crab legs were cold, not hot. The melted butter was barely lukewarm, so by the time you walked back to your table with it, it was congealing. Still, I could make do with the crab legs, but that's not much of a buffet, is it? The absolute worst part for me was the shrimp. I dipped it in butter, bit down, and CRUNCH. What the hell kind of lazy-ass place doesn't de-shell the shrimp before serving it? Plus, if it's not de-shelled, then it's certainly not de-veined! Crunchy, poop-filled shrimp should not be on anyone's list of things to eat while in Las Vegas.

For that price I don't expect to have the diversity of top end French recipes.  What I don't understand is how you can have a French buffet and NOT serve Beef Bourguignon.  Almost all the ingredients are there in various locations (mushrooms, bacon, beef, soup), you just need to add some burgundy wine,  and pearl onions and cook it down.  You don't need to use a fine Rothschild wine!!  The cranberry rolls that were available at the time were very hard, but still tasty.  The other item I would change is to offer to gratinee the onion soup, which was good and NOT over salted.  Again, add a slice of bread and the cheese, available at one of the stations, and you're there.  The desert crepes were very good - freshly made and satisfying large.

This buffet is a great reminder of what can be great about Vegas; dining in Le Village will immerse you into the feel and charm of eating in a nice village in France. From the setting to the waiters, and of course the food, the ambiance certainly sets Le Village apart from other contemporary buffets.

But the food. That's what we came here for right? And believe me, it won't disappoint. Beyond offering some of the more traditional stuff you'll see at every buffet, Le Village has French-influenced food (surprise surprise) which was a big hit for me. I definitely loved the selection and was able to try different things. And perhaps the best part of it all is that there's a crepe station to fulfill all your sweet-tooth desire. But be forewarned, the crepe line can get mighty long, so if there's an opening, it might be smart to grab one real fast.

Other hot food items were just average and so were their deserts. What really annoyed me were there are some items that they reserved for VIP customers only, and these items are not really special.

Once we were seated it was no holds bar.  We each took off and got our food.  I remember getting the prime rib which I liked the best.  Meat was tender and cooked perfect.  Everything else was just okay for me.  I was hungry so it really didn't matter.  The sole was good though.  Very fresh and tasty.  Other notable notes was the cheese station and desserts.  The creme brulee and lemon tart were really good.  I can't eat shellfish but everyone kept getting the crab legs and cocktail shrimp.

Service was good.  The ambiance reminded me of an outdoor village-like setting.  For dinner we were seated inside an actual cottage of some sort.  It felt more quiet and intimate whereas for lunch (yes we came here again the next day) we were seated in the outdoor setting which I preferred.

The tiny thick Belgian waffles though, are great.  I usually don't expect buffets to do waffles well, but it's fluffy on the inside and they have hot maple syrup ready.

There's a crepe station, but... skip it, unless you want to get a sugar overload?  The fillings are the typical sweetened fruit fillings that is super sweet.  But right next to the crepe station though are these pecan sticky buns.  If you're a fan of sweet, sticky, nutty goodness, then that's for you!

I barely touched the seafood section since we were seated near there and when I saw them refill the area, it made me to not want it since it's all out of boxes in plastic bags.  At least do a better job of presenting\/preparing it :P

Dessert selections could use a little help but I do like how they serve chocolate dipped ice cream cones for the soft serve machines.  There's macaroons but the filling is just jam, which is a little disappointing.

The weekend brunch price for around $30 is the Champagne brunch, which is great if you like bubbly but price is horrible if you want just want a meal.  Take advantage of the unlimited champagne!

The decor is pretty unique for a buffet since they try to make you feel like you are eating at the courtyard of a village.  However, it's dimly lit in some areas so it feels a little... old.

Service... is a little inconsistent.  Our first waitress was slow and looked like she couldn't wait to get out of there.  We eventually flagged down another waitress and she was great, and helped us throughout the meal.

All in all, Le Village isn't bad and $30 for unlimited champagne brunch is a fair price for Vegas buffets.  If they paid a little more attention to detail, then it would be a much more enjoyable meal.  Little things like soup could've been hotter, ice cream rather than soft serve, or even having a staff that actually cares about cleanliness.  Saw a cook refilling the soup and the water boiler overflowed after the pot was dropped it and she didn't bother wiping the station, even if it is only water.",2,0,1

Besides the crepes, everything was mediocre. I got tired real quick of everything. Desserts weren't anything special either. I suggest you get a savory crepe and leave some room for a sweet crepe! That's all you need. Our waitress was an older lady who kept forgetting to get us what we asked for or she would not acknowledge us when we called out for her. She is older so I don't want to bash her or anything, but I'd suggest management to really crack down on their employees and remind them the importance of customer service after all you are in the service industry. It's what is expected from your customers. The buffet itself feels a little outdated, but it does lean on the cheaper side in comparison to the others.

- The last time I was here was four years ago for dinner, and from what I can remember, it hasn't changed much. One important thing I did try to look for in Lunch was crab, which they only have for dinner. Expected.  
- They have a good selection of seafood stews! Loved the combination of mussels, scallops, and clams the best. I think it was called seafood bouillabaisse. I helped myself to 3 bowls. haha
- Avoid the sushi. Pre-made. Hard. Not worth stomach space, if you know what I mean. 
- There was about 5 people ahead of me when I got my crepe, so there was about a 10 minute wait. They don't have just strawberries bc they have a frozen combination of pre-cut fruits, but the chef was nice enough to pick out just strawberries for me. I recommend not passing this up! Although not great, It's an alright alternative from paying the $11 crepe outside of Le Village. Haha. 
- I was slightly disappointed that their soups did not look fresh at the time. I love buffet soups. I did not get a soup this time. 
- The pastas were great. Definitely grab the cavatappi pasta with truffle cream! 
- Sides were delicious. I enjoyed the mac n cheese and scalloped potatoes.

Wine was good; it didn't give me a headache like most red wines do.

The food is overall more dressed up American food than French. About 20% of the selection looked to be traditional French dishes.

Service is quick about taking your plates away but slow to refill your water, get you a beverage, or clean an empty table. Service also seemed overwhelmed\/annoyed if you asked for things. I asked one staff member for water and in response, she silently pointed at the server I should be asking. I was turned off by that and would have liked her to provide a more polite response.

What is bizarre is that there is a line to get in that winds around twice in front of the buffet, but if you go inside, there are consistently about 20+ tables that are empty in the back section of the dining area. Why did we wait in line for about 20+ minutes to get seated when there were so many empty tables near the serving area?

They make crepes right in front of you. It was good. Would have loved to finish mine except I was beyond full.

The best dishes there were the pork and apples skillet and the seafood bouillabaisse. There is also a carving station for prime rib.

In the dessert section, there is a variety of cookies, eclairs, cookies, ice cream, flan, creme brulee, macarons, and fresh fruit. The basket of pears was full of rotting pears. The flan was good; not the jell-o kind.

- decent food but not a very large variety
- French town theme
- great service
- high price
- expect a very long line
- definitely one of the dining places in Vegas that  I recommend 

The price: $$-$$$. I got a lunch buffet with unlimited mimosa and champagne option for about $35 dollars. Thankfully, I thought it was totally worth the money.

Our waitress was very sweet. She was quick, friendly, and funny. We even left a compliment to the manager.

I had about 4 mimosas on the spot. Try them with cranberry juice instead of orange juice, if you dare! The waitress recommended it, but sadly, I didn't think I could handle anymore mimosa at 1'o clock in the afternoon. It sure does sound good to me!

Anyway, the food was decent. The presentation was very nicely done. I liked everything that I tried except sushi, which was dry and too fishy tasting (I'm usually a big fan of sushi). But then I figured it is probably too much to ask for fresh fish in the middle of the dessert.

They have Mediterranean, Italian, French cuisines and a salad bar. The dessert option is wonderful with creme brûlée, bread puddings, ice creams, and more.

Everything was great, the price was average for a buffet, and I didn't feel like a whale after eating at least 3-4 plates of delicious food! The buffet was not overwhelming as some can be. There were a lot of choices but not so many that I felt I had to try it all which is probably why other buffets have caused me to feel lethargic after eating at them. 

The service was a little off which is why I can't give them 5 stars. We were there with friends who were Diamond members who had already paid for everyone. When we arrived there was a host that was over-catering to another group and completely ignored us. When we tried to tell another host that we had already paid and just needed to find our group we had to repeat it several times and the host for some reason still could not understand and kept telling us to get in line and pay. It ended up that we finally ended up calling our friends to come out and meet us. After that debacle things got better and the waitstaff inside was very attentive.",0,0,0

Le Village Buffet should be filed under the RIP OFF Report and reported to the BBB for fraud! They call this French food? Where's the smell of butter, where are the homemade pastries, what's up with the peasant uniforms and why are they serving pita bread, but not one French fry is in sight. In short, this buffet lacks authenticity and bang for your buck. For the price head to Red Rock, Caesars or even the Cosmo.

The line was about 100 suckers long at 9 p.m and they close at 10. When we finally got a table the food lacked freshness and the entire buffet seemed like it was closing. Tables were open all over the place, btw. For $33.50 a person I'd expect for them to at least turn up the damn lights; everything seemed covered in a haze and I wasn't even drunk. Only buffet I walked the length of and came up empty. 

It was mostly shellfish, but the carving station offered turkey breast and dry roast beef. The sides of Brie Mac and Cheese and Cavatapi Pasta were delicious, but who goes to a buffet for that? They had single servings of Beef Bourguignon (pot roast), which were good, but again where was the good stuff? The salad bar had a overly dressed Caesar salad that tasted as if they forgot to wash the lettuce.

Lastly, the buffet lacked variety, they had sushi, but not one PIZZA? They offered cold apple pie, but no petit fours! Cheap yogurt out of a machine, but no freshly made ice cream? Bread rolls, but no croissants.  Turkey gravy, but no hollandaise! I didn't leave hungry, because I'm a trooper, but I definitely will never go back or recommend to any of my friends.

For a country famed for their food and a company that just spent millions re-doing Caesars buffet I thought I a great dinner was in order. Wrong!",0,0,0

As a Vegas local and former Harrah's Diamond card holder, I've frequented the buffet at Paris for the last 10 years. I hadn't been recently so I decided to make a reservation on Open Table so I could bypass the line. When I showed up at 5:30 pm on a Sunday night and there were ZERO other people in line, I should've known right then and there that something was amiss at this buffet. I welcome an explanation or at least an apology from someone in charge of this abysmal buffet.

This buffet used to be one of my favorites but wow, it was downright depressing! First of all, there were many empty tables inside (a sign of a bad restaurant for sure). The food on the stations looked old and tired, and there were many repeats on the bars (how many trays of mussels or rice or green beans do you need)? A lot of my old favorites have been taken off the menu in favor of cheaper fare (mashed potatoes instead of sauteed scallops, for example). The seafood section was horrible! Paris used to have huge, peeled shrimp cocktail but now they have a bowl of peel yourself small shrimp carelessly slapped in a big bowl. It's depressing how steep of a decline in quality has taken place.

It's almost as if the casino has simply given up on this buffet. None of the food was labeled and if it was labeled, it was mislabeled. The employees acted disinterested in everything. Many of the food trays were empty and stayed that way for the duration of my 2 hour visit. It was just sad. It's not like we went at an off time, we went at prime dinner time on a WEEKEND night!

The main reason for my 1 star review is for the lack of cleanliness. I eat at truck stops, street food carts and dives all the time so that doesn't usually bother me, but this buffet was DISGUSTING! Spills everywhere, drips all over, sticky serving untensils, glass crusted with crud -- it was NASTY. The ice cream machine had several used cones with melting ice cream running all over. Some stations had no plates. The crab legs were shameful -- they had been picked over and NOBODY wanted to eat them. It was so gross. I have photos and video to prove how gross this place was, see for yourself. 

Quick, somebody call the health inspector!

The food and beverage department at Paris needs some serious help. Harrah's, are you listening? I am so upset that I paid an outrageous $30 per person for this. It's a dump. I can deal with less than fresh food, but the cleanliness of this place is embarrassing. Shame on you, Harrah's!",17,0,0

A lot of things are mislabeled here.  Some are just funny.  Parmesan cheese was labeled as red onion.  But then mayo was labeled as tzatziki, which angered me. (Holly smash!) I dipped some pita in it and ate it before I realized it was not tzatziki.  I hate it when buffets mislabel things.

They did have Mediterranean selections, which surprised me.  But you need to hunt for the good stuff.  They had a basket of pita that was stale and nasty.  But elsewhere in the station, they had nice hot fresh pita.

We were planning on swinging out to the Four Kegs (see my previous review) for Stromboli, but took a peek in this place. The ambiance and setting were just too much for the wife and our friend to not check out the fare. After poking around the stations we opted to pay the $23 ($20 w\/ a player's card) for lunch.

The food was fantastic and they had quite an assortment to choose from. Some of our highlights \/ favorites were:

Braised Pork Belly
Andouie Sausage
Chateaubriand style tri-tip
brie & bacon Macaroni and Cheese
Capatavi w\/ truffle oil and mushrooms

The prime rib was also to die for: medium-rare and super tender \/ moist!

Many veggies to choose from, including perfectly roasted asparagus!

They offered an assortment of seafood; including stuffed sole, mussels, clams and shrimp.

They had a savory and sweet crepe station, for those who enjoy crepes (we did not partake, however).

As for dessert they had some of the usual fare one would find at a buffet, but here they had three items that are hard to come by (and in which we indulged): creme brulee, French style (lemon infused) macaroons (light & fluffy), and custard (not soft serve ice cream).

To make a long short, we definitely got our monies worth! We are already planning to eat here again, on our next LV trip, with our son and his fiancee! The dinner menu looks awesome (includes duck!). The wife and I concurred that we would give this restaurant (buffet) five (5) stars! 

They MUST have REAL chefs working here, not the ""usual"" hired off the street types who simply follow the establishment's recipes (which usually = WTF).

Seafood.  A combination of crab, shrimp, mussels, and clams.  Not the greatest...but good enough.

Dessert.  Probably the biggest display out of all the buffets we went to.  They're your usual buffet fare...nothing was really wow but enough to satisfy your dessert craving.

Love: crepe bar, whipped cream, $12 unlimited mimosas, bacon slab, coffee, fresh strawberries, quiche, sausage. Solid selection of extremely delicious breakfast\/brunch food.

Watch out for: too many good carb options make it easy to fill up real fast, too many egg-based things (frittatas, omelettes, scrambles, etc) that all basically look\/taste the same.

Our most recent visit was this past week while we were visiting for The Shot Show\/ AVN week for breakfast. The crepes were delicious and fresh, made to order. We tried one with fresh berries and another with ham and cheese - both delightful in our mouths. Variety of egg dishes and scrambles. Great meats, ham, sausage.

We stopped in here for the brunch buffet when we got in, and I have to say I was impressed. This was probably one of the better (if not the best) buffet we've had in Vegas. The selection is not a huge around the world style offering (like a lot of buffets) where you just have a whole lot of selections of crap. The more ""French"" focus seems to help with this. That's not to say the selection is limited though. Some definite highlights were the French onion soup, prime rib, and the crepe station (specifically the banana Nutella crepe). The service was also really good, and the unlimited mimosas kept flowing. I really do like the ambiance of this location as well as it doesn't just feel like you are in a college dining hall. There was no wait when we got there , but I've definitely seen a long line for this buffet, but they take reservations so be sure to check.

For the price I paid, I was pretty disappointed in food they offered. I paid about $40? for brunch on a Sunday and when I walked in, I could already tell the selection was limited. I literally went through the entire buffet my first round & had gotten everything that looked appealing to me.  (Which wasn't much)  When it was time for my second round, I ended up just getting the same thing over again.  The food was not very appetizing at all--it was either really bland, cold or salty.  Nothing stood out & I was so sad that it was such a waste of money.  Never again.

The place itself needs to remodel... I mean, there are so many nicer buffets in Vegas now, they should try to keep up. Honestly, whenever I pass by this buffet I just wonder to myself, ""seriously?? A line for THIS mediocre buffet"" pfttt.  Throw more $$ down and go to Bacchanal buffet instead--well worth the money.",2,0,0

We were smart to get the Groupon that came out recently so it was a good deal. I did see almost all the people pay retail $$$. The line was crazy, we waited almost an hour. 
Firstly, I couldn't understand what all the fuss was about. I get that the ambience of the place was nice, but apart from that I wasn't impressed. The French ambience does make the experience a little nicer, as the buffet is organized by food from different provinces in France. That was the only interesting part , the food and service were really average.

Food - I wasn't impressed by the variety, It contained only French varieties, and no delicacies. In Vegas, one does walk in expecting some level of opulence, delicacies and surprises, especially if I am paying $40pp, which were missing. Of course, since it was only French menu, the few dishes they had were well prepared. However, as a vegetarian, there was barely anything tasty to eat. The made to order crepes were the saviors. Although, they were very nice, delicate and well prepared, I have had better crêpes in food trucks in Austin. Apart from that, all there was, were 4 different kinds of potatoes to eat! Really, after All the hype about French cooking, I was expecting some nicely prepared vegetarian options. Even the bread collection was so mundane, you can find those in your local cafeteria. 
The macaroons were the highlight of the dessert section, but again, what if they're flour less and delicate? A cookie is still just a cookie, bake me a nice cake! No cheesecakes, no tortes, no ice cream.
The seafood collection seemed ton be nice and people were enjoying the crab legs. There was a decent grilled chicken in a so called Mediterranean section, but nothing else looked interesting. I saw shrimp, clams but nothing seemed grilled or spiced. Probably the worst hummus I've had was here. Even the usual suspects, like pizza, Mac n cheese which are kid friendly were missing or scarce.

The drinks and Service - we had the bottle of wine with our package, but didn't feel like having it then. The server said, their policy was that they had to open it! Bummer. We got the red wine and it was a nice balanced Cabernet. There were other drinks like ice teas, sodas, mimosas,beers etc. The server didn't return for the remainder of our dinner and never asked to refill our drinks or bring any other. They have waitresses dressing up in old French maid costumes but they are really old and cannot keep up with the tables. There were so many empty tables, but they couldn't get them cleaned in time to get guests seated.

I'd say, forget the French hype and go for a more traditional buffet next door at pH.",3,2,1

I went this past weekend (7.14) around lunch time and let me say I've had better buffets at Hometown! First off the wait to get in was 30-40minutes. Now I understand it's a Saturday and at prime lunching hour so I was fine with that but then to not even be fed a decent meal, well that really grinds my gears! 

Despite it's creative and Disneyland-esque atmosphere the place was a mess. It had a musty weird smell to it and everything just looked so drab. It was really quite disappointing. Thank god we had a fantastic and friendly server. We got up and did the obligatory ""tour"" before actually grabbing dishes and at the end I was like ""is that it?!"" For such a hyped up place the selection was lacking. There were several stations with flys buzzing around, children putting their fingers in the food and some items looked like they'd been sitting there all day. And the dessert section, HA!!, what desserts..?! It takes up a large area of the central dining area and so you'd think it'd be packed of different decadent desserts but it was all the same - stuffed with awful brownies, sad looking apple pie, itty bitty bland cookies and the ubiquitous frozen yogurt machines. 

As for the food, well, it wasn't terrible. I had a pretty good crepe and decent roasted potatoes, brussel sprouts and french fries but I mean that's all ordinary food. This place had very little FRENCH about it. I think they need to rethink their branding or expect more customers with unmet expectations....",1,0,0

This was about 11 at night.  My car got a flat tire outside of Baker.  We got to Vegas just in time for the Paris buffet to open.

Despite that mess and how awful that last minute trip should have been, with little purpose save crazy college adventuresome spirit, all I can really remember is how great the breakfast buffet was.  

Every trip since then, I've gone back to Paris for the breakfast buffet.  It's like coming to a little slice of home- I know where various of my favorite foods are (the pears in wine are great, and the crepes are obviously fabulous).  I love the kitschy-yet-nice decor too.  Up until this weekend, it was a solid 5 star review in my book.

So then this weekend we go there.  And it just didn't live up to my memory.  It was pretty much the same- the decor, the selection, etc.  I think it was just a particularly busy day with some confusion as to whether a line was for an omelet or for just buffet-style scrambled eggs\/bacon; maybe it was that we had to get there before 11 in order not to have to pay for the champagne brunch (at Bellagio we got to choose whether we wanted champagne or not); maybe it was that the selection of what you could have in your crepe was kind of lacking now that I've become rather obsessed with crepes; I'm not sure.  It was still great, and I'd still go back.  The price (around 15 for breakfast) is waaay better than the Bellagio, but I have to say, the Bellagio's food was superior on pretty much all counts (save them not having a crepe bar).  But still, many a good memory here and the food (and incredible selection) was way better than most breakfast buffets I've been to in my time.   

Also, if you go on Sunday (maybe Saturday too), and get there before 11, you can pay the cheaper price and eat some of the nicer food they put out for the expensive champagne brunch.  Always a plus.",0,0,1

I felt the buffet did not have enough choices as some of the ones I had tried on the strip.  Although most buffets are not worth it for kids, I recommend not bringing the kids here as there is not much kids would like to eat.  There are other better buffets which have many more choices for adults and kids and for the same price or even less expensive.  I do not see much to rave about.  Adults would probably enjoy it more but not as many choices (even desserts were limited with flan, macaroons, yogurt, chocolate cake, and cheesecakes) as some of the ones I have visited.",0,0,0

I wanted an egg benedict for breakfast so when I got to the station, the egg benedict looked kind of dry not very enticing, against my judgment, I went ahead it got one.

When I tried to cut the muffin, I couldn't even cut a piece after about ten tries, eventually I gave up, the egg looked very dry, it must have been sitting in the serving pan for who knows how long, mind you this was only 9:30 AM on Monday morning. I have never had an experience like this not be able to cut a piece of muffin ever.

So you tell me how good is this buffet suppose to be? Does it deserve 4 or 5 stars rating? I am talking about egg benedict, your daily American common breakfast, how can they mess up so bad, can't even cut a piece of the muffin after ten tries? Even if I go to IHOP and order a egg benedict I know for sure I can cut the muffin and enjoy my egg benedict.

Base on my egg benedict experience at Le Village Buffet, this restaurant buffet didn't impress me much at all. Otherwise the rest of the common breakfast, scramble eggs and bacons are just like from any regular restaurants.

The salad station was pretty pathetic, there were hardly any toppings and all high fat dressings. No croutons either. The grilled veggies were delicious, though. The crepe station line is uber long, big downer. The good thing is that it IS one of the cheaper buffets, I guess I feel like you get what you pay for.

I love you, you stole my heart.

At first I thought we were going to be disappointed as we waited in the pending to be seated bench for over 20 minutes as we saw servers slowly clear tables one plate at a time. Soon after, we were seated at a table with no silverware and no one taking our drink orders. When we asked for assistance, Mindy came to the rescue.

She is a doll of a person, a happy-go-lucky lady with the swagger of a G6, sashaying through the tables with her trusty bottle of champagne. Thankfully, she didn't mind that I would finish the champagne before she finished refilling the table, thus getting second helpings.

The food was top-notch. I died on crab legs. Their sausage was so good too, as is their chicken, duck, buttered broccoli, and mashed potatoes. Skip the french onion soup. It looked gross and tasted bland.

However, the hat is tipped to Mindy.

Thank you Mindy for encouraging us to get the most bang for our buck when it came to 3:30 and the last round of champagne has come. Your Grace Kelly charm and Tina Fey wit was not unnoticed, as well as all the strings you pulled to make our buffet experience beyond all buffet experiences.

That little extra effort makes all the difference, and the $$$ in tips.

Since it was breakfast, and we weren't big eaters during the early morning, I was resigned to the fact that the food would just have to suffice. We always received friendly and efficient service in the past. This time around, we found ourselves stuck with strange and grouchy service. I was at the crepes station and asked for strawberries. The lady behind the counter snapped back, ""we don't have strawberries!"" Oooh kay... I guess someone woke up on the wrong side the bed.

Back at the table, we asked our waitress for orange juice, but a few minutes later she came back saying they were all out and offered grapefruit juice instead. Huh? A breakfast buffet out of OJ at 9 am? We thought that was strange, to say the least. Sure enough, tables all around us received tall glasses of OJ.

We have tried many of the buffets in Vegas but always return to Le Village, at least once and often a couple times during every trip there (the buffet ""next door"" is our second favorite!).

The ambiance is quaint and charming with the setting reflecting an outdoor French cafe atmosphere looking up into a blue sky.  Relaxed - ready to hit the food line!

While Le Village may not have as huge a selection as some of the other buffets in town, the quality of the food most definitely exceeds most of its competitors.  We have noticed in recent years that they no longer offer as many French items as they once had but, again, what they do have is of the highest quality, and when you can see them cooking it right there in front of you, you know it's fresh!

The breakfast buffet is wonderful and includes every breakfast item imaginable!  One of my faves are the freshly-made Belgian waffles and Eggs Benedict.  Yummy!  And being the coffee-holic that I am, the pot of coffee that is left on your table for instant refills is all I need to make me a happy camper.

I was dying to try out this place for buffet because of award winning review of this place. Let's say that this place is not overrated, but it's no where near my favorite, Wynn's.

The wait was a major bummer as we waited for almost 90 minutes for their brunch.  It was worth it at the end, but it was too ridiculous.

The food was delicious in many of the aspects.  They did some of the big ones like everyone else like prime rib steak and crap legs.  The deserts are very well made.  They also served out some of the best crepes I have ever had.

The service was also good, so there's not much of a downside going here.  I do understand that this place will be popular because the dinner is only $24.95 compare to the more costlier options like Bellagio or Wynn's.  But the wait was again too long for my taste.

I went to the IHeartRadio Music Festival in Vegas on Friday with my friend. We were staying at the LVH, but I decided to take her to the Le Village in Paris Hotel and Casino for the lunch buffet. We went around 1:30 on a Friday afternoon, and there was no wait, which was nice. The setting was nice and dark for a romantic mood. The service there was really good. Had my drinks ready when they were out and plates cleared out when new ones came in.  

Now onto the food itself. They had Prime Rib for lunch, which is kind of rare since most of the lunch buffets I've been to don't really have prime rib, they have roast beef. I tried their prime rib, which is probably my go to dish when I go to buffet's in vegas. It was pretty good. The rareness is perfect, I like my prime rib as rare as possible, but of course it has to be hot haha.. Not cold uncooked prime rib. There were lots of food choices, On my first plate I tried some clam, quiche (taste meh), mashed potatoes, pasta, and some cocktailed shrimp (however the shell isn't peeled which sucks..ended up just eating the shell and feet, at least they clean the poop out). Prime rib was the only thing that stood out. Everything else was kind of filler. I went back again for a second prime rib and this time they gave me a thick a$$ slice, it was probably equivalent to 3-4 prime rib slices they normally give. After eating that, I was just stuffed. Couldn't eat anything else but dessert. 

Dessert:

My friend ordered a banana, nutella, hazelnut crepe. It was presented very nice, but tasted ok. The nutella didn't really taste like nutella, and the nutella was like a syrup was like put on top not inside of the crepe. Only the banana was inside. They also put a huge load of whipped cream...which was too much. 

Next, my friend and I went on a dessert sampler..We got like one of each dessert available. We started off with creme brulee, brownies, some sort of raspberry cake, some cookies, flan and more. We basically only took a bite of each except for creme brulee... The creme brulee was really good, We went on and grabbed 2 more haha. That's the only dessert worth getting in my opinion. 


Overall,

I give it 3 stars, there are other choices that I feel taste better such as Bellagio, MGM and the buffet in the Mirage. 

It cost 21.99 a person, and personally did not feel like it was worth it. Go try something else. Maybe it taste better at night. For now I'll tick with Bellagio.",0,0,0

The line moved quickly. The interior is totally kitschy and what you would expect. 
We tried:
Banana and Nutella Crepe: Crepe was doughy and not authentic (surprise-surprise), banana filling was cold.
Bagel with Lox: No cream cheese or sliced tomatoes available, bagel was hard, salmon was good with just goat cheese, capers, tomatoes (from salad bar) and red onion alone. 
Mushroom Omelet. More scrambled than omelet and overcooked
Eggs Benedict: Took one look and walked away... gloppy looking mess.
Fresh fruit was great
Coffee was good
Orange juice was great (how can you screw up oj?)
Sausage was flavorful and juicy... but again cold! 

I guess if we're paying for breakfast we expect it to be better than I can make at home. We mostly took a few bites of our selection and left it alone. I wish we would have skipped the buffet and just picked up oatmeal at Starbucks... it was that bad.

But fine fine.. this is a french buffet.. so lets critique the french food. I think the only thing that was good was the ratatouille, some of thier pasta, quiche, and the shrimp. Otherwise this whole buffet was a disappointed. Food was SO bland. All the food was luke warm and had been sitting out for so long. Most of the times you couldn't even tell what you were scooping up because nothing was labeled!!!

Maybe it was a slow night? It was a Sunday night and there were NO lines and lots of empty tables for a 6pm dinner!!! So I think the food was sitting out for a long time. The most disgusting part was the piles of cold, burnt,  grilled vegetables soaked in oil. 

I can say thier desserts were a bit better. But after tasting bouchon's bakery (Venetian) - I  was utterly disappointed.

I notice that they reduced a number of their pastries and food items from previous years I've been here.

Other items of beef and chicken and whatnot were entirely unpleasant and I couldn't believe that this was the same buffet that I enjoyed years ago.

I sat and sipped my coffee since the juice they served were either too sweet or just plain gross and at room temperature. Lunch rotation came and I stuck around.

The desserts were fun. I'm glad they came out. Those sort of helped to ease my disappointment. The food however wasn't much better. Sure a few items that came out were tasty as compared to breakfast, but still not worth the stomach ache.

I love the crepes they make you fresh! Only problem was that when you order a savory crepe, they weren't cooking it long enough so the cheese and\/or ham, whatever it's stuffed with, will be left unmelted or cold inside. I made a small complaint to our wonderful server Mimi and she let the chef and her manager know. I went back for a second serving and I also asked the chef to please cook it longer and it was so delicious!! 

My boyfriend and I were served warm crab legs (bonus for being a platinum rewards member) and the legs were good as well. 

Bottomless mimosas are a nice touch, we didn't drink as much as we normally would but the refills on the champagne were a little slow. I just didn't care because I didn't feel like getting drunk. 

Didn't get to try all the food because I was in love with the crepes and waffles (so fresh!) and their different potatoes and Mac and cheese is good. Their eggs Benedict, I'm sorry to say, is pretty bad. Dry, over-cooked egg with a hard muffin and tasteless hollandaise sauce, that was a little disappointing. 
Their macarons are ok; they're made right texture-wise but the filling is just super sweet chocolate and not very good. That's a shame because macarons are amazing and it should be a highlight at a French buffet.

We got $5 off of each of our dinners (courtesy of a coupon from the IP player's club fun book.) Even if we paid full price at $24.99 each, it would have been worth it.

The ambiance was fun, with the staff dressed up and feeling like I really was dining at a cute little place in France. The foods were delicious and grouped according to different regions of France. There was some pretty standard stuff, but also various cheese, made-to-order crepes, duck, dumplings, special desserts and just other foods oozing with deliciousness. The macaroons were absolutely fabulous!

Definitely recommend coming here. It's a nice treat away from standard buffets (like Harrah's.)",1,0,0

I am generally an avid fan of buffets, especially in Vegas where spirits are up and alcohol is flowing. But in this case, I was sorely disappointed. To begin with, the line was looong, which is expected for Saturday brunchtime, but for some reason, it seemed especially long. When we were finally seated (I went with a group of 10) and began browsing through the food selection, I cannot say anything looked fantastic, although I did enjoy the setup and decor of the place. 

DISCLAIMER: Our group was a little hungover, so my review of the food here may not be 100% accurate. 

After picking at a few plates of food, my first impression was sustained. I attempted to try the crepes that all the yelp reviews were raving about, but the line was too long, or I did not have the willpower and patience to wait. The dessert section, which also looked impressive, did not hit the spot either. Many trays were empty and were not replaced during our time there. 

3 stars are because the service was good, and despite the average-tasting food, my group still had a good time. Our waitress was friendly, welcoming and very willing to meet our requests, even if it was requesting 3 different drinks per person.

Let me start off with the negative and finish with the good.

Pancakes are one of my favorite food no matter what they, I can eat it for lunch, dinner or anytime in between. These pancakes are small and I have no complaints there, easier for them to fit in my mouth. The only problem I had with them is that they kinda taste like school cafeteria pancakes, at least the first 4 did but the other 2 didn't really taste that bad. I've had better pancakes at home.
Their hashbrowns had no flavor what so ever. Where the seasonings at? The potatoe triangle I got was kinda hard.
The waffle wasn't that amazing, nor was I expecting it to taste so great based on the rating. They were just regular ol waffles to me.
Don't get me started on the oatmeal. I usually don't put brown sugar in my oatmeal but I had to this time because let me tell, this oatmeal had no flavor whatsoever. It could be because it's all natural but even Trader Joe's Steel Cut oats have more flavor than their oatmeal.
The turkey bacon, the turkey bacon spiked my blood pressure, I can feel it. It was soft and had too much salt, although some people may like their turkey bacon soft but I like it more with a crisp crunch to it, like the regular bacon they had out. I had to eat it cause I don't just waste food like that.

Now let's end with the good.

Turkey sausage was one of best things I had. Didn't taste any different from the ones at home. The fruit, I give it up to who ever picks out their fruit cause they had flavorful, sweet, juicy pieces of pineapple, cantaloupe and honeydew. You will occasionally get those non good pieces but those that were sweet were good. I can't even pick out a ripe honeydew or fruit if my life depended on it. That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars.",2,2,1

Only two things are great.  Their prime rib and creme brulee.  I had 4 pieces of prime rib.  Even the center part,which is usually less flavorful and dry, is just as good as the coveted outside portion.  They didn't cut slices but pieces for you.

Once seated, the choices were what one expects from an upper echelon Vegas brunch buffet: carving station, Eggs Benedict, breakfast meats & potatoes, souffles, pastries, pastas as well as some unexpected options like sushi, pre-cracked crab legs, knockwurst & bratwurst with sauerkraut and a made to order crepe station.  All of the food was of good if not great quality, the stations were clean and well stocked, and the service was prompt and courteous.

The staff were very nice, but the food was nothing to write home about. This buffet is def not in the same tier as the upper echelon of Vegas buffets. It's about the same price as the upper tier buffets, but gives you mid tier quality. For example, there's no ice cream\/gelato at the dessert station.

It was cold and the crepe was already getting stale. :(

You know you shouldn't do it but damn... it's too good and yes, sometimes you do regret it after a big belly overstuffed with food and you can barely walk. You feel awful and complain but then will do it all over again the next day.

OK... I do have to admit that I have self-control and I do not do buffets more than once a month. But heck, you're in Vegas... the city of excesses and for a foodie like me, this is heaven (and hell).

I'll be organized and break the review down to several key criteria;

Price: Don't recall how much I paid for it (mine and 3 of my dearest friends - I was feeling generous that evening!) but it wasn't cheap. Starve yourself that day and come prepared to splurge to get your money's worth. I'll give it a ""B"".

Layout: Any great buffet connoisseur knows that the layout of the food is pretty important. Take a walk around all food stations first to assess the game plan. Prioritize your favorite food and most expensive food (crab, lobster, etc) at the top of your list. To hell with the proper starters, soup\/salad, main course, dessert order - you are in charge here! Anyway... I digress. The layout was a little confusing and I hate it when they don't provide a proper plan that outlines where everything is. Don't you hate it when you find another favorite dish but didn't see this station until you're way stuffed! Happened too often. I'll give it a ""C"".

Food: The most important of them all - it's good, at times excellent (snow crab legs - juicy, meaty and tasty) and on rare occasions, disappointing (blue crab - cold, dry and tasteless). The hot food section with prime rib, roast, etc were OK. I would have like more creative variations of the usual meats but it's usually a hard sell. Most folks like their meat familiar - yeah, you know who you are - the un-adventurous types. Boring! The desserts were pretty good with a decent selection and variety. I'll give it a ""B+"".

Service: It was spotty but when available, they were friendly. I asked for some nut-crackers to help with the snow crab legs but they didn't have any and provided some other utensils instead which didn't quite work as well. I'll give it a ""C"".

Decor: They are trying for a French cafe\/street look and it sort of works. However, the tables and seats are a little too close together and the tables are relatively small. The place is also a little noisy and being seated amongst the food stations, there's lot of traffic around you. I'll give it a ""C+"".",1,1,0

There's always a long line to get in, but it moves fairly quickly; about a 20 minute wait at the most; i think. Maybe the weekends is more; not sure.

The reason I didn't give it more than 3 stars is that I've been to better buffets in Vegas; and also their dessert selection wasn't all that good. and you would think that being a french buffet it will be all about the pastry!

They do have a crepe station which is a big plus; but still I've been to much better places in other hotels.",0,0,0

Honestly there was nothing too memorable about this place, beside the custom crepe making station, which I took advantage of of course. The food was different since it seems to be French based, so don't to find mush Asian cuisine (if any) or American food for that matter.

The selection of food was not as good as the pricier buffets, but we still found a few things we enjoyed. The best meat dish was this braised beef - the meat was off the bones tender. Paired with the leek mashed potato and an assortment of grilled veggies, the braised beef made a delicious entrée. As for the other savory items, we sampled a little of everything, but nothing stood out. I was disappointed at first that the crepe station did not have banana and nutella for the day, but ended up enjoying the fresh blueberry crepe drizzled with apricot sauce in the end. I would definitely try this combination again. The creme brûlée was as good as everyone said-the BF and I practically inhaled a plate of these creamy dessert.

When it comes to food, I'm more of quality than a quantity guy and - since I'm paying for it dammit - I prefer my food brought to me rather than the other way 'round.  

That said, I've allowed myself to be dragged to the buffets in almost all of the major Vegas hotels (Bellagio, Wynn, Four Seasons, the Venetian, etc).  And in each case I left stuffed but incredibly unimpressed.  Buffet food is almost always the most bland, pedestrian, overcooked, lukewarm dreck.  And I just can't get much of a hard-on over crab legs, sorry.

Then I tried the the Paris buffet.  What a hidden gem.  Instead of a bacchanalian orgy of tasteless dross, I found a casual French buffet featuring surprisingly high quality cuisine.

The dining room is set in a Disney-esq recreation of a French country village, complete with stone buildings and a simulated blue sky (with clouds).  Scattered amongst the faux architecture  are various food stations, each representing a culinary region of the country.  

Note that this isn't an American buffet in a French theme park;  Much of it is quite authentic (at least to this gastronaut).  You'll find mostly familiar fare (crepes, quiche, Coq au vin, etc) as well as  a few unique offerings you may not have tried before, all surprisingly tasty and well made.

In the center of all this is the dessert station, strategically located and sporting numerous decadent French mini-pastries (if you were looking for frozen yogurt and sprinkles, sorry you're out of luck), which are continually refreshed and therefore not stale (as with many buffets).  I'm a dessert junkie, so this is my favorite station, one I generally return to more than once in an evening.

There is almost always a line to get in here, so prepare yourself for a 30min wait at peak times.  In my experience, the best time to avoid the crowds is ~3pm.  If you don't mind eating early, you can generally walk right in.

Note that I don't want to over-hype things;  This is still a buffet. Not everything knocks it out of the park, and the food is certainly not going to compete with Bouchon or Le Cirque.  But if you have to do a buffet while in Vegas, this is your best bet, IMHO.  Worth a try the next time you're in Sin City.",1,0,1

Ate here during the holidays last year, and it was a 4 out of 5 star when the food was a little above average.  Visited here on Father's Day with a friend from SC and my brother and sister-in-law in hopes of celebrating Father's Day.  BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER!!!  The hostess sat us at a table near the desserts, which we did not choose.  The duck, prime rib were so bland and dry!  I had to dress it up over and over before it was up to decent edible flavor. :( I was in total disbelief as to how disappointing the meat was.  I was so turned off, that nothing else seemed up to par except for the Crepe's.  It saved the day!  I had the banana-nutella.  But, now that the crepe shop opened up across from the buffet, the buffet should now be shut down, sealed & condemned because it shouldn't cost  $33.55 for a good crepe.  

Service was definitely a MINUS -5 stars.  Servers were dazed and not helpful with ingredients when asked.  My brother had seen tables around us getting their frozen crab legs steamed, so he got a plate full of crab legs and asked the server where to get them steamed.  He instructed him to have the waitress take them to the steamer.  When he asked the waitress, she said our table was for 7Diamond card holders only, and that we were mistakenly seated in the area where only the 7Diamond card holders are seated, and that in no way was she allowed to steam our crab legs.  The manager was requested, and arrived with an attitude before he even spoke. Since we were mistakenly seated in the wrong area, he was going to reprimand the hostess.  No compensation for the customer or apology!  As manager, he could have at least appeased my brother (on Father's Day) and steamed just this once since it was their mistake and not ours that we were seated in the 7Diamond area...?!!  Wth..?  Voices got loud, but the manager clearly was unable to manage his hot temper and proceeded to call security to have us removed.  Asked for our money back and were ignored.  

PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BYPASS THIS MONSTROSITY OF A PIG STY!  

Am I upset?  You bet!!  Go to The M, Bellagio or South Point, you'll be glad you did!  There's a definite disconnect among the hostess, servers, waitress & the unqualified manager who definitely needs more training.",0,0,0

Pork chops with the rhubarb chutney were my favorite! So tender and savory sweet. The proteins here are generally pretty decent.
Glass of $9 red added a nice punch. Especially with the olives and cheeses they had.

I was examining the crab legs when a guy nearby started asking the lady behind the counter about the availability of clams. He had a French accent. A lady joined him at his side and partook in the conversation about the clams (""klehms"").

And they had macaroni and cheese made with some truffle oil. It was gross, it was all butter and a tiny dash of truffle oil to make it smell like it. 

The only thing good about this place, in terms of food, was their unlimited crepes. I was able to get a dinner crepe and a dessert crepe after. Both were OKAY. 

The staff that were working and taking our plates were very sweet. They refilled our drinks as soon as they were empty and they took our plates fast. I was able to converse with one of the chefs making my crepe, she was cool too.

I've been to the buffet at the Luxor, MGM, Rio, Wynn, TI, Bellagio, Flamingo, and Ceasar's Palace, and definitely over the years, new ones have popped up, and chefs change, but Le Village has always done it for me.

I enjoy the Paris setting in general, the light blue, cloudy sky ceilings make me feel like and happy as i sit and enjoy my meal.  I feel like the extensive selection of various foods from all across the world is better here that a lot of other places, too.

I think what really does it for me is that I feel like the desserts selection is so good!  I know a lot of people where desserts is not a big deal, but for me and my and big sweet tooth, this selection was great and exactly what I wanted!

It tends to be much busier on weekdays because it's cheaper compared to the weekends. Be wary of long lines, especially for dinner!

I went on a weekday at about 11:00am. It was about an hour wait. Once we were seated, however, a waiter quickly came to take our orders for drinks. He was very courteous and took away plates and refilled drinks quickly.

The buffet has a salad bar, crepe station, a dessert section in the center, and European style food. There was pasta, saffron rice, potatoes, sauerkraut and sausage... all good.

The place is a bit cramped and dark if you're in the middle of the buffet. The long meat line can make it harder to see some of the food. But it is all worth it and more. Here are some notable foods:

The snow crab legs are what you'd find at many other buffets in Las Vegas. Fresh and good!

As for the shellfish, the mussels and clams were done in two ways when I was there: tomato-based sauce and white sauce. Both are equally delicious.

The prime rib is rare and melts in your mouth. I haven't had any better meat in my life. A long line can form along the buffet for this, so plan ahead!

There was a moderate selection of deserts such as small cakes, tarts, and the creme brûlée. It will definitely satisfy your sweet tooth.

The only complaint I have is the duck. It was dry, tough, and nearly inedible. However, there's a wide selection of other meats to choose from so it didn't affect the dining experience.

Now, as you're probably aware this place is not cheap! So here is a ""plan of attack"" for the buffet to get your money's worth:

1. You probably waited for a while and you're starving. However, you don't want to stuff yourself with the first plate. Make the first plate all seafood (crab legs, mussels, clams). Avoid carbs.

2. Get in line for some meat. This will let your stomach rest for the plate of meat.

3. Now, if there was that one pasta you've been wanting to try... eat those carbs but limit them if you want to eat dessert.

4. DESSERT!

I am a Las Vegas local with dietary restrictions and have gone to many different buffets downtown and around Las Vegas and never had an experience like I just had. Upon entering the buffet I told the hostess that I needed to speak with the shaft due to dietary reasons. I had to wait over 10 minutes for the chef to come to my table well everyone and everybody else was already eating. When I told him my dietary restrictions the chef laughed and asked what does he expect me to eat... And that was my question to him I said.  I told him I cannot eat cheese or eggs and that I do not eat meat and follow a vegan diet.. He right off the bat said unfortunately there's not much that I could have on the buffet... And I told him I've never had an issue at any other casino with him making customize items for my dietary restrictions. ( nothing crazy- just vegetables with oil instead of butter, pasta with no cheese, some type of potato, maybe something else?!) but wasn't offered anything and said that everything was pre-made and couldn't be altered... Also when we walked around the buffet he told me I could eat stuff- for example- rice pilaf. I know from experience rice pilaf is usually cooked with chicken broth, so I asked him that and he said well yes it is. 3 times I had to tell him I DO NOT eat meat. 


I found a bowl of hummus and asked if it contained dairy in it - as some\/most do. He told me they do not make it here so he is unsure of what is in it. When I asked if he could find out he said that he would have to go all the way to the other end of the casino to find out... Really you are a Chef and do not know what is in the food you are cooking. 

On top of that, I went to get the only thing that I could eat- fruits and veggies and they were out of raw veggies completely. 

The service was also very slow for how NOT busy they were. Our waitress did not refill drinks and forgot to get other drinks we ordered. Plates were not refilled and would have to walk on the other side to get them. 

This also is not just because I can't eat a lot of foods- the other two people in my party were not satisfied at all. I would rather go to a buffet for $8 bucks instead of blowing over 30. For being a diamond member , I would say food was not good( so I heard) , service was not good, and overall very disappointed.

I have been told by many people how great this breakfast buffet is; but personally, I don't see it nor do I understand why anyone would think that it's any good. Maybe since I only tried one breakfast in Vegas and this was probably the best one compared to others? Seriously though, the only thing that I enjoyed here were the grapefruits and strawberries. Everything else was just simple breakfast food like bagels, oatmeal, bacon, ham, etc. and it tasted average, if not, pretty bad.  

However, the setting, design, and decors at this buffet was just very nice. It was basically like you were in a French village underneath a blue beautiful sky. Also, it was cool that there were different food stations. There was a station where you can make fresh crepes and another where omelettes were freshly made just how you like it.

Here's what went wrong for me: 

There were so many different variety of scrambled eggs at one of the stations. Everything had eggs and eventually, it was just quite overwhelming. Another thing was the fruits. Some of the fruits tasted weird and did not taste fresh at all. The grapes tasted soft and weird while the honeydew and cantaloupe were not sweet at all. Then the drinks, I tried the coffee, which tasted horrible, the grapefruit and orange juice, which both tasted horribly. 

The service here was horrible!! Besides from our waitress (who was very nice and lovely), everyone else was so rude! So we ordered a crepe and wanted a regular Nutella crepe with nothing inside... We tried to tell the chef that, but he didn't hear or wasn't listening and asked what number. So we thought we had to pick a number and said ""one."" Then after, we can just leave stuff out. I mean. It's not like I knew and it's not like he even started with the crepe. So when we asked politely if he can you exclude the bananas and such since we just wanted Nutella. He said with so much attitude, ""Don't say one then!"" Well excuse me rude guy! We did say what we wanted but you asked us for a number! 

At the omelette station, the guy before us ordered two eggs prepared sunny side up. The cook broke both of them and asked the guy it. I just thought that was funny. Other places will throw it away and make new ones. Anyways, the point is, service here isn't good. If they didn't say anything rude, they just looked as though they were having the worst morning of their lives or they just hated working there.

Bachannal met their dinner quota at 2pmon this day and was sheer madness. Plus you have to pay $30 more on top of your buffet pass.

Honestly, if i could, i would've eaten $30 worth of pasta\/ mac n cheese. Thats all i ate here.

Everything else was mediocre vegas buffet food. 
The salad was drenched in dressing.
The macaron was a fake macaron with chocolate gumball drop in the center. 
Bellagio macarons are so much better.

The sweet mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts, and mushrooms were delicious. 

The service was terrible but understandable because of holiday madness.

Keep in mind I am reviewing their breakfast buffet, which was pretty mediocre at best.  The selection was very scarce...I am a person who enjoys variety, and there was not much to choose from during breakfast.

I got in line for the crepes with pretty high expectations, thinking that since this is a breakfast buffet in a Parisian themed hotel and casino, their crepes should be pretty awesome.  But no, I was only met with disappointment after waiting in line for 15 minutes.  I could not believe that a Parisian  themed buffet could not afford FRESH fruits for their crepes.  Are you kidding me?  They were using strawberries soaked in what was probably high fructose oh-so-bad-for-you syrup!  Even the bananas and blueberries were swimming in some kind of syrup.  I ended up only eating about three bites of the entire thing.  What a waste of my time.

Some other things I ate:

- Eggs Benedict: These were the only highlight of my entire breakfast.  They were pretty good, so I ate two.
- Prime Rib: I've had better. It was very bland and lacking flavor.
- Roasted Beer: I thought this tasted better than the prim rib.  It was nicely seasoned.
- Spinach and Cheese Quiche: BLEGH! It was so disgusting and hard when it should've had a nice and flaky crust!  I took one bite and had to force it down my throat.


I wish they had a better selection of desserts and sweet pastries, considering it IS a Parisian breakfast.  Maybe I should've gone here for dinner so that I could've tried the amazing Creme Brulee that everyone raves about.  I am a huge sucker for desserts and have a major sweet tooth.

The pot was raised when I heard about the 24-hour all-you-can-eat deal, and then raised some more with rave reviews from friends and Yelp. In our little quartet, me agreeing to do the buffet deal would make two frequent guests friends happy, and my boyfriend full of food, so the expectations were positive, so I went all-in.

The result? The food was pretty good! And by my math, three meals came to ~$15 each, which is a steal for Vegas (you can't even get a drink at a club for that price). The veggies were fresh, the meat was surprisingly juicy, but the real star of the show was the crepe area. Oh boy, I threw in some poached pears and drizzled raspberry sauce on top - delightful.

Helpful Hints ...
*Have your drink order ready when you approach the counter to pay for your meal.  This is the only place that does it this way, so just be prepared for that question. 

*Ask if you can be seated in one of the little alcoves.  The noise level is a lot lower and there aren't massive amounts of people weaving around your table staring at your food. 

*Wait in line for the Crepe.  They are delicious - especially as a dessert stuffed with your favorite fruit.  

*If you don't see an item on the buffet that was listed on the menu, let someone know and they will track it down for you.  This goes for the meat preparation as well.

*Don't skip the mashed potatoes.  They're delicious!     

One star gets deducted for the crab legs.  Having been spoiled by a few of the other buffets, I was not a fan of having to crack my on crab legs. But there were plenty of other items on the buffet that made up for this slight inconvenience.",0,0,0

This buffet is definitely more like a normal buffet, some good items, 1 or 2 excellent, and the rest just meh. I give it more points though because there were more unusual items and I found some things I really liked. Still though, at 25 it's not a bad one to go to. I found enough things to make my tummy happy anyways.

Sunday night I waited about 45 minutes to get in. Their line is situated right in front of their buffet with a good view of the inside. So you can kinda see what the place looks like and all. Basically looks like the rest of Paris, so I was kinda excited to be able to eat in a cute quaint ""Parisian"" atmosphere. Ok so i've never been to Paris, but ya get what I'm talking about. Unfortunately I was shunted off to the side room near the bathroom so that just left the eating part to indulge in.

The stations are all divided into certain areas of Paris with slightly different themes, the dessert station is smack in the middle near the fruit and salad and crab legs station. The best things were the snow crab legs, and the crepes. I don't particularly like king crab legs since they tend to be drier and less flavorful. Snow crab legs are smaller and more work, but I think worth it. They cut slits in the legs here so it wasn't that hard to crack and the meat pulled right out. I really could've eaten so much of this but I didn't want to fill up tooo much. Crepes were made to order, fruity dessert crepes made in a weird location though. Right inbtwn dinner food and not at the dessert area. You picked the stuff inside, they make it, then you top it off with whatever you like. Whipped cream, nuts, fudge, caramel and other things.

There were other things that were pretty decent, but not excellent. At the end I noticed that they had a crayfish dish! I had seen the dish before, but no crayfish since someone prolly picked them all out. Boo...I would've loved to just eat those. Plenty of veggies here also, cooked in several different ways. A cheese platter area, and different types of bread. Desserts were decent, the mini fruit tart was tasty. Brownies too.

The outrageous prices they charge and the mediocre food they serve!  You can spend the $25-$40 at a much nicer restaurant with quality food and service.  They have this buffet around the world deal where you can visit one of seven buffets for a 24-hour period for $39.99 or $34.99 if you have a Harrah's player's card.  Yeek!  Never again will we step into a buffet in Vegas.

Ambience- Cute, small French village is charming. (4 stars)

Food- Old, stale, unsanitary, and bland. (2 stars)

Service- Hit or miss.  We went twice: dinner service absolutely sucked because they stuck us in this room and didn't see the damn waitress.  We also think she was being bitched around by her supervisor that night.  Thus the disappearing act.  Breakfast server was friendly and cordial. (2 stars)

Highlight
*The $39.99 deal for 24-hours.

Lowlight
*Food
*Long lines

I loved their clams, shrimps, pork belly, and some kind of pasta and mushrooms in cream sauce. The crepes, you must try! We shared three crepes at our table and my favorite was number 2 (with lots of berries). Also, the macarons are not the best I have had but they are good. They are just a tad bit sweeter than I would like them to be!

The only negative thing about this buffet was the slow service. If you are someone who just cannot stand this aspect of a dining experience, I would not recommend going here. But your waitresses will get to your table and you will be well on your way to having one of the best buffets of your life!

Overall, I love le village for their food and the french atmosphere. I would recommend!

This is absolutely my most favorite buffet in Vegas. I HAVE to eat here whenever I come for a visit. Le Village buffet is located in none other than the Paris hotel. If the name didn't already give it away, the buffet itself looks like a little French village. Food lines the walls all along the interior and in the center is an amazing dessert station.

The food is always delicious and fresh. There's something for everyone to enjoy. They offer a salad bar, crab legs with melted butter, prime rib, roast beef, veggies, sushi... I could go on forever. The mashed potatoes are to die for. It would be sacrilege if you went without trying them. But the kicker in this place is the fact that they make fresh crepes to your liking, right in front of you. Want it filled with bananas and strawberries? They have it. Blueberries? They've got that too. Cherries, chocolate sauce, caramel sauce, syrup, whipped cream, powdered sugar? Yes. ALL of that. It's oh so decadent and heavenly, eating one of these crepes should be a sin but I suppose gluttony comes in pretty close considering you can eat as much as you want. It doesn't matter though when everything's so good. Please eat here when you go to Vegas. If you don't, lie to me and say you did anyways.",1,0,1

Yes, some are better and some are worse, but this buffet falls right in the middle between a must visit and a completely avoid. It's also included in theTotal Rewards Buffet of Buffets, which is a great deal especially if you go to a buffet you don't like because you can just leave and go to another without paying an extra fee.

There is a wide selection at this buffet, like at most buffet's. Its a french theme so even though there is a lot to choose from, there isn't a huge variety like you would get at the Planet Hollywood buffet. 

Everything to eat here is decent and really depends on your palate and how the food is prepared that day. The menu of what they serve here hasn't changed in the last four years so they'll probably stick to what they have. Most things to eat are a serious hit or miss and the only real consistent thing I've had are the pastas, which are totally not good for you but really tasty in my opinion. My brother got food poisoning from the crab legs here so I would stay away from them. But honestly it's kind of a rule of thumb that you shouldn't eat shellfish from a buffet anyway.

The desserts here are a complete miss in my opinion. It's a French themed buffet and the macarons are different colors and only come in two flavors which are underwhelming to say the least.

Service was slow and everything that should have been hot\/warm was cold except the coffee.  For example, the tomato soup and chicken crepes were luke warm at best and we began eating as soon as we got our food. 

The taste of many food items was highly disappointing as well.  Few items tasted really good which was not the case on our last few visits.  Also, there was prime rib but it was mostly fat and gristle and nearly raw.  Further we were never told (and didn't recall) that champagne or fresh juice was an option.  :(

We've been here several times and have always loved it but today will be our last time as the value proposition and poor service and unappealing cuisine makes it a poor choice for us.

One last critique for Paris...their self parking set up is a bloody nightmare.

We felt uncomfortable and asked this waiter named DANRICK (tall, dark Philipino male) if we could move to a more secluded table under the faux trees. DANRICK gives us a look and tells us that the area we requested was reserved for VIPs (which was understandable). He then goes on to say that we can go back to the end of the line to request to be seated in the VIP section. I said, ""No, that's not necessary,"" but he continues his tirade by picking up our receipt and pretends to take it to the front so we would have to go back in line. I repeated that we were fine where we were and eventually he went away. I have never been so UPSET at the service I received.

I get it, you're a hostess at a buffet restaurant that takes in hundreds of customers every day. It's 8PM and you're probably tired but when my family has to repeat to you for 5 minutes that my cousin has autism and therefore can't wear his buffet wristband, yeah we're going to start off on the wrong foot. Furthermore, if you have to degrade us in front of everyone by slowly repeating ""Make sureeee you don't lossseee the wristband"" more than 7 times, we definitely have a problem. My family's of vietnamese heritage but my parents speak clear english, there was no miscommunication, just a very dim hostess with a disgusting attitude. 

On to the dinner food. I've pay less money for better buffets outside of Vegas. I think that's where the sub-par rating comes in for me. I believe that when you tag seafood as a characteristic of your buffet then there better be some decent seafood to back that up. Instead, all you get is some average shrimp and crab legs. If you want to call the imitation crab sushi as seafood, then i guess that's one more you can add to the list. 

All the fish dishes were insignificant. From what i remember Salmon was dry and the sole was less than flavored. I could go on and on but I think we get the point by now.

There's the typical food that most buffets have - salad, cheeses, Mexican, dessert, prime ribs, lots and lots of bread, etc. But what caught my eye, and my friends' eyes, was the crepes station! There were eight different crepes to choose from, with the maximum of two at a time. Four were savory and four were sweet. I opted for the sweeter crepes, and ordered the berries one and the apples one. The line took about half an hour before I finally got my crepe. After the long line, I'd have to say that the crepes were okay, but not great. The skin was a little too thick for my liking. For my berries crepe, I thought the berries were too sour. I liked the apple one a lot, but there was too much caramel sauce drizzled on top for me to enjoy. I was also able to try La Caprese (the pesto one), the chicken one, the ham one, and the banana and nutella one. Basically everything offered that morning. The best would have to be the ham one. The mozzarella cheese and pesto - the mozzarella balls didn't melt so it was pretty blehh. There's a jar to tip the chef for their hard work, as there is only one pasty chef making the crepes at a time. 

As for the other food, I heard the prime rib was not too good here compared to Rio. The mushrooms were pretty tasty, but a little too much sauce. I didn't see any crab legs that the other reviewers commented upon, but I suppose there was a good variety. 

The best best part of the buffet was the creme brulee. Oh my goodness, it was so melt in your mouth sweet and delicious, and the top perfectly burnt. Must try! There wasn't any more fruit tarts when we went, but we asked one of the pastry chefs who had some hidden! He said he only gave them to the people who asked since there were so limited left. They were pretty good, too :) 

The atmosphere is really cool - live birds flying around your head and the whole place looking like a french cafe or village. You can sit ""inside"" or ""outside"" - very delightful. I do wish that there was more than one bathroom! A buffet with only one toilet? There was a super long line in the ladies room.

And I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe lunch and dinner is different than breakfast, but I was super impressed with the selection of food. Lots of breakfast meats. Crepe station, omelette station, pastries, waffles with strawberry sauce, fruits, yogurt, oatmeal, cereal, quiches - the list probably goes on! I would recommend eating here and the prices are decent.

People were commenting on the staff being rude. I didn't come across one rude person, in fact,  they were all super sweet, friendly and helpful. The omelette guy was amazing and entertaining. Our waitress always had our drinks filled and someone else was removing plates from our table as we finished with them.

I am definitely a foodie and when I get to enjoy good food, I am a happy person. This last trip to Vegas, I got to enjoy many great buffets - Wicked Spoon (lunch and dinner), Bachannal Buffet and the Buffet @ the Wynn.

Le Village's standard is worse than Hometown Buffet. Everything is laden with salt. Don't bother trying the seafood dishes either. Everything tasted frozen and old.  Even the breads were cold and stale. How can you mess that up?
And as for presentation - it reminded me of the horrible buffet from the movie, ""Vegas Vacation"". Everything looked brown, saucy and yellow.

And to top of our visit, we were sat in the section with the worst waiter. An older gentlemen who said ""oh my god"" as he came to our table. When I asked him for an ice tea, after he forgot the first time, he scolded me and cut me off with ""okay, don't worry, i got it"". And then never bringing me my ice tea - EVER. He disappeared after that. He didn't even take away our dirty plates. I had to take my plates and my guests plates over to the bus boy station, myself.

I ordered a savory crepe with mushrooms, spinach, and parmesan and a sweet crepe with Nutella and bananas.  Then pretending I was a food artist I paired the savory crepe with salad and smoked salmon.  I then got some fresh strawberries to accompany my sweet crepe.  Both crepes were delicious!

Foods there are generally good looking and has a good variety, but I am not sure how long they've been there.

You could always see the waiter with a dish cart near by, but he just kind of stood there and stared at us through the door way - it was kind of creepy. 

The people next to us left without tipping, so after the waiter saw that, he began hawking us and constantly took away our dishes\/gave us refills. There were moments where he just stood there in the room counting his money in front of us (signaling that we should give him a tip).

The decor is cute and very French village-esque. However, the selection seems small. The crab legs ran out and weren't refilled quickly. So, I only got to have a small serving. I do like they are already cut in half for easy eating though. I liked the mussels in arrabbiata sauce but I don't know if this is just a specialty item. There isn't anything too out of the ordinary in the dessert section either. Mostly just pastries.

There is a Crepe bar (i had strawberry\/banana), an omelet station, of course, then there were the benedicts, quiches, and other egg dishes. Many different potato dishes and corned beef hash (to die for). And don't forget the sliced ham, bacon, and\/or sausages.

People, it's only a buffet!!!  And you're paying $25!!!!  It doesn't take a math nerd to figure out that it's not worth it!!!!  For half that price you can get a good meal without feeling the need to stuff yourself like Kobayashi in order to feel like you got your money's worth.  But what am I saying, that is so un-American... skip a buffet, and the terrorists win, I guess.

The line to get in was intolerable.  Our group relegated itself to playing word association games in order to keep ourselves from going crazy from the 1 hr wait.  (Side note: if it were up to me I would have left after seeing the line, but others in the party wanted to go, so I relented.  Believe me, I will hold it over their head like the sword of Damocles, oh, don't you worry.)

The scrambled eggs, sausage, and bacon were dismal.  They had a crepe station that seemed okay, but remember, you're paying $25! Imagine how many individual crepes you can get at this price!!

They had prime rib which was about a 5.75\/10, and the rest was completely forgettable.  I guess the Coke they served was okay, it was about a 7\/10.  The desserts were acceptable, they had small interpretations of what was supposed to be creme brulee which didn't disgust me.

I wasn't super impressed the first time however we did arrive during the transition between brunch and dinner so I figured maybe not as many options were available.  To my surprise I actually preferred brunch time since they had more dishes that catered to my personal tastes; eggs benidict and smoked salmon? That's pretty much all I need in my life with some good dessert haha. 

Everything in general is just kind of 'meh' and didn't feel it's worth the money. One of my friends was actually really disappointed with the place and wish we would have went elsewhere for our buffet fix.

If you want some prime rib, turkey or stuffed lamb be prepared to wait in another pretty long line. The lamb was good but not that great. I can get soooooo much better lamb near where I live. My friends really enjoyed their prime rib but boyfriend said it wasn't the best he'd had either.

There's never really a line for any of the other sections of the buffet. Potatoes are whatever...but like I said most things served here is medicore with nothing particularly standing out. And to my disappointment the dessert here was lacking. Come on, the french revolutionized patisserie! I would have expected a lot better. Oh well.


Overall I'd say if you're gonna go to a buffet go big and go to Bacchanal if you're really into your seafood (they had the best\/freshest options for that department in my opinion) or I really enjoyed Bellagios (my personal favorite) buffet which had the most options overall at only $30 a person.",1,0,0

Other staff cleared our tables and did everything possible for one of the best experiences so far at Le Buffet.To start, I consumed French onion soup, French bread and some cheese and I had died and gone far from where I was.

So let's see what changed...oh yes! they had Creme Brûlée!  I didn't get to eat it, because I had a creme brûlée phase 4 years ago, now it's over so I don't really care for it anymore. Their crepe station was excellent, along with their crepe chef, who was very nice and funny (5 stars for this alone if I could do that)... 

What else, what else....think...thinking...thinking...nothing.  Nothing much has changed - still A-OK per Yelp's 3-star standard. So sorry, but won't be visiting the buffet at Paris again. Instead, I'll stick to the creperie or the pizza place across the way.",1,0,0

After eating here, quite frankly this place isn't much different from any other buffet. If I were to compare this with any other buffet that I've been to then I'll say that this buffet isn't worse nor is it better than those buffets I've attended.

They do have a very reasonable amount of dinner items, and I tried to taste as many things as my stomach would allow me. Other than their mashed potatoes and their seafood items nothing really stood out and inspired me to make an urgent return. Even their dessert was nothing special to me. They had a few items that were satisfying but nothing that made me want to come .back again.

I don't think this is a bad buffet and I'm pretty sure that you will be able to find something you enjoy eating here. I mean its a buffet.

Hey this isn't the best buffet I've been to but I do believe that it can get the job done in filling you up.

I haven't decided if I'll ever come back to this buffet because there are so many buffets in Vegas. I guess if I'm on limited time and don't have the time to go to any other buffet then I would come to this one.

This was the first time I had eaten at the Paris buffet for dinner and I was quite pleased. We went later in the evening (around 8ish). Being a lover of buffets, I usually go to the Bellagio for dinner. Or else I wanted to try the Wynn. But my friend convinced us by telling us that they have fondue (melted cheese, my favorite!). But when we got there.... no fondue. We asked the waitress and it seems that they stopped a while back. So for those of you expecting fondue, THEY HAVE STOPPED THE FLOWING OF THE CHEESE. 

But otherwise, it was a pretty good deal. It was cheaper than other buffets and luckily there was no line. One thing I enjoyed was the fact that they had dungeness crab as well as king crab. I enjoy dungeness so much more. The grilled vegetables section was GREAT. The asparagus was the size of a curling iron! They also had some great seafood. The sushi (apparently a French food) was mediocre.

I found a lot of the hot food to be cold. The cheeses were like something you'd buy from the grocery store- not particularly gourmet. I was unimpressed. If I were to ever come here again, I'd get a savory and a sweet crepe for dinner and skip most everything else. 

I also find it kind of sad how much food is wasted because, oh, this looks good, ew, gross, it's cold, let me leave it and go get something else.",3,0,0

One of the hardest things about vegas buffets is that once you start eating at the higher end ones, the older ones just don't seem as good. Le Village buffet for brunch was a waste of $, it was basically like paying for an overpriced Hometown Buffet. Maybe even worse 'cause at least Hometown Buffet offers carved ham. THAT'S RIGHT, LE VILLAGE DOESN'T SERVE CARVED HAM FOR BRUNCH!! I've never been to a buffet where they didn't have ham for brunch lol.

I don't even know where to start w\/ the review on this buffet. I've never been to this buffet so we decided to try it. The line was moving pretty quickly and wait wasn't that long. It was $30 sunday w\/ unlimited champagne, but too bad it took forever for our server to refill the drinks and on top of that she spilled TWICE on the table and it got on my friends. The service here is the worst I've seen, all the employees look like they hate their job and are miserable.

One of the MOST unorganized buffets EVER. Food items didn't match the labels and on top of that they put the omelette station at the window of the dessert station, like wtf? I requested an EGG WHITE omelette and the chef was giving attitude\/lied that he didn't have egg whites left. LIKE BRO it's still early in the morning and your buffet isn't that busy, there's no way you have no more egg whites, so I said fine make it w\/ the yolk then. After he finishes making the omelette he decided to say ok let me go to the back and check if there are any egg whites. LIKE WTF?! WHY DIDN'T U JUST GO IN THE BEGINNING BEFORE WASTING AN OMELETTE?!!? ON TOP OF THAT, WHEN HE WENT TO CHECK, HE LEFT MY MUSHROOMS\/VEGGIES COOKING. They were near burning when he returned. The other chef in the dessert station even gave me the ""wtf? why'd he leave this cooking unattended"" look.

The desserts here sucked, for a buffet that is supposed to represent Paris, their pastries were HORRIBLE. Croissants were worse than costco, the macarons were nasty as well as the variety of carrot cake, cheese cake, etc. Tasted too artificial and worst than store bought at Albertson's. Talk about waste of calories for this buffet. The only good thing was the Crepe station and soft serve ice cream. Crepe station you can select from their menu of sweet or savory crepes. The banana nutella hazlenut crepe I got w\/ vanilla ice cream was good, but the crepe needed more texture to it.

The prime rib and roast beef lacked flavor even w\/ au jus added. It was cooked to medium rare but still tasted dry. The mushroom truffle flavor mac n cheese was horrible. The macaroni noodles were mush, not al dente at all, but at least the truffle flavor was there. The steamed veggies were like mush as well. The crab legs were constantly running out and it wasn't even that good. The crab meat seemed old.

BTW, they have restrooms in the buffet, but TOUGH LUCK! It is as horrible as the buffet cause THERE'S ONLY ONE STALL!!! I can just keep ranting on and on about how horrible this buffet is, but I'm sure ya'll get the point already. AVOID AT ALL COST!",19,13,7

Only stone crab, unpeeled mediocre-sized shrimp, and weak prime rib.  Even the crepes and desserts, which I find Paris should be the best at, wasn't as impressive.  The brunch always seems to be the best for me here.  

Sorry, but as of now, I won't be returning for a while here.

For a buffet, I was shocked on how perfect the egg was on my benedict, and how crispy the muffin remained.  It was just amaing.  The sauce was decent, nothing earth shattering, but the benedict as a whole was well balanced and good. 

The brie mac and cheese was amazing!  It was creamy, not too salty, and the sides were nice and charred.  The macaroni shells itself had a nice firmness, so it wasn't this mushy pile of mess.  I couldn't help but get seconds and thirds.

Overall, the buffet was decent.  The prime rib was actually good, and if you wanted a more crispier cut after your first serving of medium slice, they can grill your slice for you.

First off, we passed here a few times while staying at Bally's, each time we passed the line was RIDICULOUS!! So we kept walking...well one morning waking up hungover & starving we decided to head for the closest buffet in hopes that it wouldn't be too long of a wait, after all it was a Thursday morning!! We get there and it was the shortest we had seen, YES, SCORE! ...NOT!!! We get in line & pay rather quickly but after you pay you wait....& wait..... & wait....& wait some more!!! They are smart, they make you pay before you realize how long you really have to wait!! So we finally get almost to the front, the hostess takes the party of 2 that's ahead of us to a table but NEVER RETURNS!!!!!! We stood there about 15 minutes in the front of the line!!  While we stood there wondering if she would ever return we saw a few waitresses pass by, a manager pass twice, another worker come answer the phone & argue with a customer on the phone...not one of those people said ""is anyone helping you?"" Or ""sorry about the wait"" or ""someone will be right with you""! Really?! What kind of manager walks by with no care of how his guests are being taken care of! At one point I said to my husband lets just go seat ourselves, Who would notice??? NO ONE!!!! Finally a different hostess comes from behind us in the line to start her shift, the other hostess had left on break or something with no one covering her!!! There were about 20 empty tables, SOMEONE could've sat us!! ......anyways as you can tell I was furious with this ""service"" (especially after spending 22.99 a person) !!! 

Moving on to the food... I thought please Paris redeem yourself with this food!! Nope...terrible! It's like they are trying too hard to be fancy...the food Is roasted potatoes, garlic Brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes, Mac & cheese, sausages, pork & a few other random things. It was all gross! The best thing Is the ice cream, if you do decide that you just have to go here, get the ice cream.

The salad \/ fruit counter  was mediocre (only melon and water mellow as fruit) and included a not particularly good sushi (French?). The crepes were disappointing - not even the option to put fresh fruit in it. The sweets were not that good either, some cakes and and of course a very French soft ice cream machine. 
The price for lunch was 25 plus taxes. Kids 4 and older pay 14$. Considering that we are not big eaters and there were not many dishes worth trying it was really a waste of money.

(That should have been my first clue as there always used to be long wait times just to pay). The place was not busy and there were a lot of free tables. 
I would have to say with LV hospitality, I was not impressed with our waitstaff. Forgot my drink, so she brought me water. She never came back to refill any bodies drink or get my drink corrected. My water glass smelled fishy.....I couldn't even drink out the glass. Gross! We ordered coffee for desert and ran out of sugar with no body to get us more. There was also still food on the table when they sat us. I overheard a server next to us at the end of our visit explaining champagne was included on the buffet. That would have been nice to know before we were leaving. 
On to the food....I didn't expect a brunch menu at 2:45 in the afternoon on a Saturday....especially for the price! There were about four different sections of eggs and potatoes, and some kind of sweet bread breakfast (ie: French toast, pancake, waffle). One of the French bread dishes was so hard, even with vanilla sauce to moisten it, I thought I was going to break a tooth. No variety!!! Atleast with other LV buffets (not even as highly hailed as Paris) they have a lot more breakfast options. Lots of the food looked old and gross. I love seafood! The shrimp and crab legs looked gross. I just passed them up.....which I have never done! 
The crepes I have to admit are still amazing! I also loved the macaroons on the desert section. However, the deserts are not as glorious as the used to be either. 
I am such a foodie and would always brag about Paris. I am embarrassed that we took friends from out of town there!

The well kept secret is that they'll make you a nutella crepe. Oh hells ya. Grab some strawberries or bananas from the fruit section first and then go over there and ask them to make your crepe with your fresh fruit.

Anyway, the all-in-all experience of this buffet in Vegas was not shabby at all. The quality of the foods in each station were standard. Variety was alright and there were some items that I wasn't akin to after taking a few bites, such as all the steak offerings -- whether it's beef or fish. Not surprisingly, there were some edibles that frankly didn't appear to be edible to a superficial foodie: e.g. would you trust overly cracked macarons from the sweet stations?

Yet, I stumbled upon some foods that were quite flavorful. For paying dinner price I'd surely nibble on the Duck a L'Orange and ravage through the Crab Legs, even if some limbs were semi-frozen. Last but not least, I certainly found foods that grabbed my taste buds in awe: the addictive Truffle Mac & Cheese, anything with shellfish (which I was personally surprised), salad, cocktail shrimp, anything with veggies, and the scrumptious Brandy Apple Crepe.

This buffet is definitely not for 1st timers in Vegas and for those who need tons of flavor in their gastronomic life.

We arrived about an hour after they opened and were seated right away.  I researched blogs, and ratings and this buffet came up as one of the best in Las Vegas. I was willing to pay the extra for what was described as a really good buffet.    I was so excited, and unfortunately was very disappointed.  
The good:  The ambiance and service was good.  I liked the sweet polenta, lox's and the sliced ham.  My husband liked the savory sausage bread pudding.
The mediocre:  Pretty much all other food was so so and nothing to rave about.  The crepe bar was a nice touch, but the actual product wasn't a big deal.
The Bad:  
1. If you are going to charge $25.00 a person for a breakfast buffet you should not be recycling your bread products!  Really???  One of the least expensive things, and they couldn't toss the incredibly stale leftovers from the day before?  I got a bagel and it was a definite leftover from the day before.  I thought maybe I had just picked a bad one, I went back and checked all flavors with the tongs, and a sampling of all bagels in each basket thinking maybe they put the fresh ones towards the back...nope.  They bagged up yesterdays, and put them back out in the morning.  The croissants were small and over cooked and nothing special....for a french themed buffet you'd think they could have had some fresh baked ones to offer.  Again the pastries and bread products are subpar.
2. The melon offerings were thin and not replenished - empty bowls sitting there.
3. Quite a few of the signs telling you what the item was that was on the buffet were wrong.  I'll assume no one took the time to change the signs from the buffet the night before?  Or maybe they have been like that for months...who knows. 
I wish we had gone to Golden Corral (do they have one in Vegas) for  1\/2 the price and in my opinion a lot better breakfast offerings.  I feel ripped off.",0,0,0

This is the second time I've had the same waitress located in one of the middle rooms (skinny middle-aged woman). The host sat us down and told us to wait for the server to get our drinks. So, like well-behaved students we sat...and waited...and waited some more for our waitress to come over. I was literally watching her as she went from empty table to empty table to set up the plates and utensils when literally there were other customers in the room who needed tending to. There weren't even new customers going to those tables that were being set up. We waited about 15 minutes before she randomly came over with juice and iced tea to our table which we did not even order. It took about another 20 minutes before we were even served water and coffee, but no coffee cups. Once the room started to become filled, she took everyone else's order first, before coming to our table to finally ask what we wanted to drink even though we were there before about 90% of the other tables. It was just SOOO ridiculous.

The previous time we came about 6 months prior, we had the same lady. She gave us attitude when we wanted 1 champagne and 1 juice for each person.  I don't understand why it was such a big issue when in the end she just gave us a jug of each. So simple, yet she had to make such a big deal out of it. Then, throughout the entire meal, she was giving us the stink eye.

Food-wise: I would say it's just average. There's not a huge selection like Spice Market or Bacchanal. There was nothing that really stood out to me.

Tip: If you do decide to come here, try to get a table that's not in the middle room, preferable a table in the main area. Service has always been better there. If you get seated in the middle room beg to be moved elsewhere. You've been warned!",2,2,0

I love the variety; the atmosphere; the service, and the FOOD! 
I totally recommend the duck l'orange. It's my fav. item on the menu.

Thanks from other Yelpers recommended this place for breakfast especially with a 24 hour buffet pass. 

There is a huge variety for breakfast. They have make your own omelettes and sweet\/savory crepes. There are regular scrambled eggs and egg whites. The usually toast, bagels, pancakes, french toast, bacon, and sausages. They serve bacon slabs at the carving area which taste way better than regular bacon. 

The service is superb. 

The lighting for breakfast is really dim. It felts like the sun just started to rise up at 5 am. Hopefully they can change the lighting for different hours in the day.",0,1,0

Come back here much older and much less jaded by Vegas, I can think clearly about how this place actually is.

The GOOD:
+ I really like how the stations are organized into little french houses\/store fronts. It makes the whole atmosphere really cute and unique. I felt like I was getting crepe at a crepe shop and bread at a bread shop.
+ Food definitely tasted good. They had a large variety of foods for breakfast and lunch. 
+ Breakfast: make your own crepe station, waffles, biscuits and gravy, eggs benedict, ham, sausage, bacon, eggs, potatoes, hash brown, and all sorts of dessert items. Lots of things to try and taste.
+ Lunch: asparagus, prime rib, chicken, 3 different pastas, fish, and all sorts of other stuff. 

The BAD:
+ The line was easily a 2 hour wait any time around breakfast... I felt like there was no good time to go. (Tip: You can pay an extra $10 to cut the line at any time, per person. Also if you have anything above a Diamond card, you can cut the line for free.)
+  Breakfast is served till 11 AM... and they will switch on you with NO warning. I was in line for the crepes and was looking forward to getting the rest of my breakfast items but when I got out of line, EVERYTHING was changed from breakfast to lunch.... everything basically just disappeared without warning. After paying to cut the line... I was VERY disappointed by the fact that I couldn't actually eat breakfast...

I think if you plan properly (ie. check times and plan ahead to wait in line or pay to cut), you will enjoy the food here. It's tough getting in, but after that, you can plenty of chances to enjoy a delicious buffet.",3,0,0

It's like once we decided to split they were not Happy and wrote a big SPLIT on our Check and each waitress said oh their a split and made sure we were in 2 different rooms far apart from each other when there was plenty of room in our room and other people came in so they still had other party of fives in there. They were not friendly and although the food was good and had a good variety we will not be returning due to the poor customer service and horrible attitude of the staff. The other 3 buffets split us no problem and still sat us by each other and guess what we left a good tip.

I suggest getting in line when you fill like you may be starting to fill up because by the time you get your food, you will be hungry again!! LOL.

I got a banana nutella one and for my savory, a chicken with asparagus. Both were flavorful and delicious!!

I think next time I would try lunch or dinner to see if it's really as good as I remembered since I think the crepes are offered all day.

A lot of sausage variety also and at least 3 types of potatoes that I saw!

Well worth the hefty pricetage you'll pay almost any time of day for this killer buffet, which on my recent trip included: cheese ravioli w marinara or garlic cream sauce, fresh-baked breads, foreign cheeses, candied yams, mashed potatoes, roasted garlic potatoes, garlic green beans, and create-your-own-crepes were the best parts of the meal but I ate so much that I was literally in pain by the time I left.

Non-vegetarian wise, my girlfriend loved the meat products, including fresh carved meats, sushi, seafood, chicken, French onion soup, and so much more. I can't recall everything that we ate, but we cleaned up good.

I will say this, DON'T MISS THE CREPES but make sure you have room in your stomach to eat them because ooooh my god they are amazing. I ordered strawberry-banana-chocolate crepes and could only get through half of it, despite how bad I was drooling for more. My stomach just could not contain.

The ambiance of the experience is half the fun as well. It's like you're sitting outside at a French market cafe, all blue skies above and a cozy, intimate seating area. Tres romantique, oui?",1,0,2

Highlights: great raw seafood - shrimp, snow crab, etc.  The flan was damn good as well as the crepe area.

For ~$25 this is a great way to get fat.  Also, this was for the champagne brunch - which is a fun way to start the day and watch the hungover people in your group cringe.

If not for the Wynn, I would have named this buffet as the best in Vegas.  I love their set-up and how they cateorize each section by the different areas of France.  Being able to sit in a ""village"" setting under a faux blue sky was nice, but I think that they could have increased the lighting since it seemed a bit dark.  

It was my first time there and I had some things not usually found at other casino buffets.  They had a really delicious roast duck with a sweet glaze...it was just the tiniest bit dry, but it was still good enough that I had two breast pieces and a leg.  I also liked their salmon in the creamy leek sauce.  The salmon skin was crisp on top and it was surprisingly tender in the center.  Unlike many other buffets, the salmon was not dry and over-cooked.  The best dish out of the entire buffet, though, was the mussels in saffron sauce, which was amazingly good.  Even with all the food I had just eaten, I had two full bowls of these mussels.  Dip the sauce with their fresh bread (yes, its the cardinal rule of buffets to not fill up on carbs, but the bread here, was fresh and delicious) and its out of this world.      

I also liked their fresh crepe station, though I wished that they had savory as well as sweet fillings.  Strawberries and bananas were missing as filling options (though they did have blueberries and some really gross, gooey apple filling), though they were VERY generous with their nutella.  Having a nutella crepe with whipped cream and slivered almonds on top was the best way to end a meal here.

I can't remember the dessert section too much, since my dessert consisted of the crepe.  I think I might have had some creme brulee there, but it wasn't anything that stood out in my mind.  

Overall, an excellent buffet.  Service was good, though a little slow.  The line wasn't too long when we went and we were seated fairly quickly.  Le Village Buffet has a good selection of interesting foods and its definitely one of the buffets I'd return to!",4,0,1

But, for what it's worth, I really enjoyed the few items I got!  I got two large serving of the roasted lamb and mint jelly.  The lamb was nicely seasoned and so juicy.  On the side I had 3 kinds of potatoes: glazed fingerling-sized sweet potatoes, yukon gold mashed potatoes, and leek mashed potatoes--all were really delicious.  I was also excited to see that they offered stone crab claws that day.  Even though I never tried them before, I could tell that the quality were not the greatest.  But hey, I was just excited to eat multiple bowls!  I didn't get to make a crepe or omelet at their respective stations, but I liked the idea of having both available.  The only downside was the service which started off being inconsistent but gradually improved as the meal progressed.

We find the salads to be fresh, and plenty of options. Desserts are among the best and a nice variety. However, the location of the desert station is the omelet station for breakfast and it is in an awkward spot.

Staff is always attentive and friendly. Most bend over backwards to make your meal enjoyable. Just take a deep breath, and make sure you look over everything.

Crab legs...yes, prime rib yes....but both were of low quality and the prime rib was super dry. And yah, it's supposed to be a French buffet so they did have some of my macarons, but they were gross and unappealing. They didn't care about the presentation at all with respect to the macarons.

The food handles were sticky and gross. There's no wet naps or purell nearby. It's like someone purposefully lathered the the food handles with syrup and pretty much played a prank on everyone. Gross, and unattended, and lack of ownership amongst the cleaners and food servers.

The waitress knows who you are too, ethnicity, etc...so when she saw a bunch of filipinos, she got into Filipino mode. I guess she really wants to provide that awesome customer service, that or she wants a fat tip at the end. Either way, she was pretty attentive. 

It was a Sunday, so champagne was included. They went all out with the Wycliff Jean champagne....whewwww. Mix with the oj and you get the mimosa. Not bad, they even allowed us to keep the bottle to walk aimlessly throughout the casino and along the vegas strip.

Cute decoration makes you think you are sitting in a lil cafe in a village in Paris... very nice touch.  Very satisfied for coming here and will definitely be back.",6,0,2

When I get there, I realized we paid the same amount on Groupon they charge for dinner so I thought what was so special about our Groupon then? We got unlimited Mimosas, wine, and beer with our Groupon and that didn't matter to me because I don't drink like that. Anyway, this place is French inspired so there is lamb, duck, cheese trays and whatnot. I tried the tri-tip and the lamb and they tasted exactly the same to me, it was weird. The selection to choose from was not large at all. I ordered a mimosa and the orange juice was bad, tasted very cheap. The only thing that was cool and good was the crepe station. There was a man making crepes with anything you wanted and they were really good to. That was the only reason why I gave two stars. Lines was long and slow. We had to wait 40 minutes just to be seated. Not returning.",0,0,0

The food was just okay, sure you get as much as your glutenous heart\/stomach can desire but a lot of okay isnt as good as just enough of great. With so many options on the strip for dinner $30 per person can get you some pretty amazing meals.
They have a lot of italian and french inspired foods to choose from. Yes they have crab legs, but they are cold and not that big. Also prepare to bring you ingenuity because they dont provide crackers or those handy small forks. Even the roast beef and steak are on the lukewarm side.
The pastas are decent but again the quality of the selection of food is only okay at best.

Look around for a better quality of food buffet or more than likely an actual restaurant. Plus then you can avoid all the people running into you while your trying to pile your plate high.",0,0,0

Having spoiled by lots of Chinese all-you-can-eat restaurant, our visit for dinner has not really impressed us. The waiters were not nice and the cashier are rude. But if you come for food then only taste that matters. we like the French dessert which I only served here.  Order Le Relais, which is really good. 
Here is the tips, want to enjoy good sea food in a brighter and spacious environment, go walk across the street try The Buffet in Bellagio. $21 per person. If you plan to stay for 2 nights, get a 72 hrs buffet pass will save you a lot and it works in other buffet as well.",0,2,0

one large bowl of mixed fruit, no separation.
every french-named item sucked. 
cauliflower au gratin tasteless and nuclear green.
salmon roll was 90% dried stiff rice.
roasted tomato had grill marks, but tasted cold.
mashed potatoes had chewy unknown pieces.

This was meant to be a birthday celebration. 

The staff at the front and who sat is made near impossible for us to start the celebration. Since we didn't tell the people at the register that we were a party of 9 they couldn't seat us together or in the same section. They would have to separate us per ticket. Seriously?!?! 

First they took the party of 4. Sat us far out away from the other 5. This was the ""Best"" that they could do for not being aware. There were many empty tables but they went out of their way to make sure our group. 

The birthday girl was fed up and asked to speak to the manager. Instead of just calling. She (I didn't get her name) just gave total attitude and mimicked the Birthday girls request. She called someone on the radio and walked away. 

This is where Nina stepped in. Nina was the second lady working on seating people. She wasn't crazy about anything that had been going on. She gave us attitude as we're but she came through in the end. Nina actually showed some compassion. She was finally willing to sit us together as a group. 

We were finally able to start our birthday celebration! 
Our waitress was absolutely amazing! 
I'm glad we were able to get past the seating issue and get to the food & great company.",2,1,1

AND we had an excellent Groupon for two for $34 that included a bottle of wine (turned out to be a LARGE bottle too), and was good enuf and a deal. If I had paid $25 a piece plus without the groupon and bottle of wine this would be my A-OK 3 star rating. We really like the Paris property, and the Mon Ami Gabi restaurant is a favorite.

We leaned heavy here on the cold seafood, and salads, much less so on the meats and we thought it was a good buffet. Very good crepe bar, and some nice sides like cheese assortments, french onion soup, smoked salmon, LOTS of deserts and ice cream bar of course.

The wait is annoying and seems unnecessary since they have more seating usually, they need to improve something on their end. We waited 40 minutes at 8pm on a Sunday night. It's also pretty loud in there on a faux cobble stone street with those carts bouncing around. Table seating however was very nice and we weren't crammed on top of other people. I recommend it, but check GROUPON, seems like that deal is always up. Don't forget the crepe bar.",2,0,1

All of the desserts were fresh and delicious, the carrot cake, chocolate cake, cookies, custard and banana nutella crepe.  I'm a vegetarian and I had more than enough food to choose from. My husband enjoys his meats and had plenty also.
Cons: The service was slow. More than one station had everything labeled incorrectly.

The food was not good everything was either dried out or not cooked right. The only semi good thing was the crepes and for the amount they charge it's not worth it all. My Apple juice tasted like beer and it was so bad I couldn't even drink it and I love Apple jucie. Will never be going back and the fact we wasted our money sucks.

Definitely try the crepes!  I started off with a savory crepe which had mushrooms and spinach,  It was absolutely delicious. 

I then tried some pasta with truffle cream sauce that made your mouth water it seo good.  I sampled some lamb & Prime rib that were very good,  Some German like sausages with Kraut, smoked salmon with an assortment of cheeses, some salads and an assortment of other things.  Everything I tried was a party for my palate.  

Then after my meal I sampled the caramel apple crepe and the strawberry, blueberry, raspberry crepe that were to die for. 

We had a large group and they made us pay 17% gratuity that I thought for a buffet like this was a bit much. Especially when the service is not quite a good as the last time I ate at a Golden coral.... Lol.  

If you're picking and choosing I would definitely go to Bacchanal in ceasers palace over this one.  However it is worth a try.",0,0,0

What I liked most is that you can get a crepe made in front of you. You'll get a choice between three types, cherry, blueberry and a fruit of the day. I'm a big fan of the cherry variety, so I ordered that. They also have a dark cherry topping you can add along with hazelnut bits. There is a large salad bar area and a slightly smaller dessert section.

I think there might be better options when waiting in line this long for a buffet in Las Vegas. If you like French themed food like crepes, there are a couple of other good dishes here too. Thanks to Caesar's Entertainment Corp for supplying me with a buffet wristband to test a few out.

I would like to try the Champagne Brunch, as others have suggested, which might add an extra star to this buffet.",1,0,1
