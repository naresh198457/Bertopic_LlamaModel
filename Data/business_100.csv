The airport does have a good number of food options for a mid size airport.  That is a big deal.  We all want options.

The other issue is one that it is hard to hold against the airport, it is a US Airways hub.  I cannot not blame Charlotte for that.  You take what you can get, even if it is US Airways.",1,1,0

* Many clean restrooms with very friendly attendants

MAZE - this spot is huge and an absolute maze.  I was flying back on an already 2-hr delayed flight and had to clear customs, recheck a bag, reenter security, and run to terminal B all in 30 minutes.  The international bag pick-up is sluggish and it is actually difficult to find the right exit.  On top of that, customs to baggage claim to security to gate is unreasonably spread out.  I made it with ONE minute to spare because the system was so slow.  

SERVICE - the workers are bleak and trudge along as if travelers are not in a hurry, which is not pleasant

DELAYS - When I was growing up, my main airport was always timely.  Whenever there was a delay, the plane was coming from Charlotte.  This is a well-established pattern, as I fly ~5 times per year.  Additionally, Charlotte air traffic control must be running on poor technology, because the taxi wait is always long as is the landing.

I took photos of the shower with long black hairs strung to the walls. Disgusting when you are forced to stay somewhere else at the account of American Airlines.

Recyclables are co-mingled, which is ecologically responsible. Gates are light years away from each other with skin-of-the-teeth connections all too commonplace. Just as often, there's a last minute gate change, which will have you doubling back on that 4 minute mile, Prefontaine.

Runways and taxi ways are also laid out very poorly. This can add more delays to your flight even after the flight has landed.

The airport concourse corridors are narrow and hard to navigate. The floors are carpeted with very old looking carpet, which makes pulling ones bag more difficult. There isn't any tram or train to take one from concourse A to B, C, D or E.

This review is not blaming any airline. The blame is  solely with the airport board and the Charlotte city council. This airport was never designed to be a high volume airport in a large and growing city.

When I used to fly US Airways all the time, CLT would figure in my travel at least once a week.  Now, it's rare that I get to go through CLT.

It's a fairly new airport and the layout and amenities show that.  It has a wide open, airy feel to it in most concourses, especially the International concourse.  The central area where the B and C concourses meet can be a bit of a madhouse at times with people rushing between gates.  But there, in the midst of all this traffic, are dozens of cozy Adirondack style chairs where you can relax for a bit if you have the time between flights.

There is often some live entertainment in the central area... grand piano, country music, jazz - I've seen it all.  Lots of food options too - and a full fledged cigar\/tobacco store - woohoo!!!

Weather in the area is usually good which means minimal flight delays.  Delays are inevitable in a hub airport but when they do happen, CLT makes the experience a little less stressful by providing a lot of distractions in addition to the wonderful Southern charm of all the people working here.

Great place to connect if you're headed to the Caribbean - you're almost there already ;)

Anyway, we have no hope of having the phone returned, as it's nearing two weeks of silence. But just wanted to put the word out there to warn everyone that the Lost and Found department at CLT is useless. Remember to hold tight to your belongings!",4,0,0

Charlotte Douglas International Airport is the major airport serving the Charlotte, North Carolina area, and is a major hub for American Airlines. 

Compared to other hubs such as Dallas (AA) and Atlanta (Delta), Charlotte is relatively compact. They have multiple terminals A-E, most of them taken up, as one would imagine, by American Airlines. 

Charlotte is created on a spoke system, think Disney's Magic Kingdom.

In the center you have the common area of restaurants and shops, and then the legs of the terminal sprout from that central area. Each terminal itself is lined with additional shops and restaurants. 

The airport itself appears to be in a state of transition, where as some spots are nicer than others. 

The customer service leaves something to be desired. Perhaps Charlotte just lacks that traditional ""southern hospitality"" charm one would often find in the Carolinas (like Charleston, South Carolina). 

They're not the rudest, but employees at the airport (airline and merchant employees) certainly do things their own way on their own time. 

Airlines try to limit the lay over time, so the good news is you won't have to spend much time here. The other good news is, if you do, there are plenty of food options, both quick service and sit down. For both options you can find anything from burgers to bar b cue.",0,0,0

First of all, no matter what time if year, this airport is always freezing. There is a large glass atrium which is kind of like a hub for all the terminals. The atrium is pretty with several places to grab a bite to eat including Chilis, Carolina Pit BBQ, Cinnabun, Tequileria, etc. The Atrium would be a cool place to sit and grab a bite while watching airplanes take off and land but the temperatures are always arctic! I would guess this maybe has something to do with all the glass but no clue. 

This airport is not family friendly. There is nothing like the convenience of a Family Bathroom when you are traveling with an infant. While this airport has several Family Bathrooms, they are always locked and never available for use. Because of this, I am forced to change her in the crowded restroom while my stroller, diaper bag, body, etc block the traffic flow of people trying to get in and out. This is so frustrating!

Every other time I fly out of this airport, there is some kind of problem with our tickets or some crazy delay. I think I've spent more time sitting in a delayed plane on the Charlotte Tarmac than I have in the actual airport (probably not but it sure feels like it and being delayed with an infant is not fun!)

It seemed no one was interested in opening new lines but yet standing around and talking about how long the lines were. To top it off, I watched my bag sit on the tarmac while the ground crew chatted up over something that was obviously more important than doing their job.

Today though I can update my review to say the Delta check in and TSA PreCheck experience was fast and seamless. PreCheck is not available at TSA A so even though I was flying out of A gates I opted to use Pre at TSA B. TSA A&B terminate in nearly the same place. TSA C takes you to the start of D Concourse, but that's not a far walk from A. 

Nothing in this airport is far which I love. No matter where you are flying out of if there is a restaurant or store or service you want to access anywhere in the airport you can do so with just a short walk and without having to reclear security. 

The main area where all TSA checkpoints let you off is really quite beautiful for an airport. I love the trees and white rocking chairs and all the natural light. There is a food court, a few more substantial sit down restaurants, shopping and a second level with seating away from the heavy foot traffic. 

The A Concourse offers a general store, one sit down eatery, a sandwich shop and a Wendy's. Jet Blue, UN, DL and WN fly out of A. There were plugs by the gates, at least as far as DL is concerned. 

B has an AA lounge (the smaller of the airport's two) at the concourse start. There's a California Pizza Kitchen and a Carolina themed eatery both with good tarmac views. B has more food options than A plus a Starbucks and a larger general store. A sandwhich shop and a bar type eatery are also found further down the concourse.

The shops from the main area extend into the C Concourse. There are more unique gift and electronic shops, a burger bar, fast food and grab and go options. The Sbux in this Concourse also has its own seating. A seafood place is near the end of the hall with a final news shop. Outlets by the gates seemed limited - there were a couple standing height counters with plugs. 

D. The better AA Club is here. The shops and food from the main area continue down the hall a bit before the walkways to D&E. There's a massage place too and another Sbux with its own seating area. This is a more spacious terminal, but not as much to do. A smaller gourmet food court is about half way down. The striking difference is the appearance of tile floor versus carpeting. If you go down to the end by D12 there is a Charlotte city view. And since the international planes leave from here u may get a cool foreign carrier in the skyline view.

I will agree with many of the other reviewers - this place is bright, clean and has some good restaurant choices.  If your layover is long enough that you don't have to be sprinting from one area to the other, there are a lot of good places to hang out.  I have been to the Chili's and the Fox Sports Bar so far, and have to say Fox Sports Bar is one of my favorite airport places ever.  I wouldn't mind sitting out a several hour delay there.

At the same time, I am extremely bothered by the whole bathroom attendant thing.  The bathrooms were busy and the bathroom attendant was a hindrance to everyone trying to get in and out of there quickly.  People don't need to be told when they go to the bathroom where the toilet or the sink is, and there was no purpose in having the person there.  And then you feel guilty for not tipping, because there is a big tip jar there.  Why would you tip someone who hasn't provided any type of service for you?  Then I worry, what if she is actually the janitor, and they made her ""bathroom attendant"" so they could pay her crappy wages and claim she was making up the rest with tips?  Then obviously few people are tipping her, so she would then make less than a normal janitor.  I hope that is not the case, but who knows?  I thought it was very weird that there was a bathroom attendant in there and I will be avoiding those bathrooms from now on.

My only critique would be the process for international arrivals. American citizens no longer have to fill out the customs declaration form, but do have to queue up for a bank of machines that take your picture and scan your passport.

Amenities - Cheap covered parking (as compared to other cities), covered parking in walking distance to airport, lots of food options (Bojangles, Tequileria, Chilli's), bathroom attendants, free Wifi (a big plus for which I only found in CLT and PIT) ,easy access to power, rocking chairs (near power access), and two US Airways lounges. 

Airlines - Mostly US Airways, as it is a hub. Presences by Delta, United, American Airlines is also noted. The plus for CLT-ians w\/ US Airways dominance is that most flights are direct.

No experience with security, parking, or check-in, tho, since it's always a connection from CHA or TYS.

Now, the two things that really are irritating:  Why do I ALWAYS have to fly in on Runway R18?!?!?  It takes a friggin' fortnight to taxi to the D or E gates from here.  Uggghhhhh.

The other is the distance between terminals.  E gates are spread out like crazy, and if you're walking from A to E or something similar, then good luck.

Fortunately, if you fly US more often than DL, you connect here instead of ATL.  Charlotte doesn't get as many random storms, and the airspace\/runway traffic isn't as bad, so delays aren't as likely as they are down in the A.

It's not like there's a better airport in town for me to fly out of.  I also doubt that the owner of Charlotte-Douglas Airport is going to read my review and send me an email apologizing for his business' poor service and terrible product like a restaurant owner would do.  Writing an airport review is as futile an effort as catching wind with a net, but I'm going to do it anyway.  

Parking here is cheap and shuttle service from the various lots and garages is good.  The airport is quite clean; especially the restrooms.  To me, these are the airport's only redeeming qualities.  

Traffic flow at the arrival and departure gates = pure misery.  

The TSA force here is unfriendly and inefficient.  Large airports like LGA and BWI run their security efficiently and I find that the lines move much more quickly than they do with the hapless crews they have in this town.  I have to disagree with my friend Nicole W. about Checkpoint A.  Standing in this never-ending line is like eating a misery cookie that's been dipped in s#@%.  A couple months ago the line from the Delta counter nearly ran out the doors while those of us not checking bags were forced to wait in this line rather than being able to use a kiosk to print our boarding passes.  ""What was wrong with the kiosks?"" you ask.  One of the three was out of order, but the other two were simply out of paper.  I suppose that one of the Delta representatives sitting on his thumb behind the counter couldn't take care of it.  Par for the course at CLT.  

The food selection here is miserable (are you sensing a trend here?).  I tend to always end up at Tequilaria, but the place smells like damp Clorox rags and fruit flies buzz around the bar.  There seem to be a lot of positive reviews about there being a Bojangles at the airport, but I can say that a Cajun chicken breast and a biscuit is not what I'm looking for when faced with the proposition of sitting in front of screaming children on a cross-country flight.  I give the food options a D-.

She was screaming at people to hurry and move out of the way (and I promise you, no one was taking their time). 

Our family moved a bit on down and found our ride. We started loading our bags and our getting our two young children's car seats in the car. While doing so, we were approached by an airport employee who told us we could not load there (although there were no signs that said it wasn't a loading zone). So we said ok, stopping packing the car, pulled our family back onto the sidewalk and our driver pulled into a place that was a ""loading zone"" (again no signage for this area either). After we moved, the employee ended up giving our driver a ticket because he didn't move the car fast enough and finished putting one of the bags in the car before moving it (we still had three more bags to load, mind you).

People were having to park on the curbs because no parking places were open. Plus, the shuttle bus was way over crowded and hot. Clearly they are not set up to handle the volume of traffic at the airport.  

My wife and I try to always choose the security checkpoint lines with the metal detectors instead of the naked body scanners. But we were directed by the TSA folsk into a line where only the naked body scanner was being used. So we opted out, which meant that we had to wait for a pat down. And wait. And wait. I don't know what the delay was but it was ridiculous how long we had to wait. 

Once we were through the TSA nightmare, our experience in the airport wasn't too bad. There's lots of space at the airport so even though it's busy, you don't feel like you're in chaos.

It may not be the best airport ever, but after my experience in Newark, I am inclined to think it was quite alright.

We flew into the US Airways terminal so that's all I really know. It was huge, but luckily there were plenty of moving sidewalks for getting around. It also ended up being much bigger inside than it appeared from the outside.

The most obnoxious part was the beeping cars driving around, transporting people. That drove me up the wall, and I found it was hardly necessary. If you've been here, you know what I mean.

Anyway, I am not much of an airport or duty-free shopper, but I would think that this airport would be appealing for those who are, as there were plenty of shopping opportunities, and lots of food options as well (albeit overpriced, but that's expected).

I've been to several USO's at airports, and this is a very impressive one. Although it doesn't have showers and beds like some of the other ones I've seen, this one has this feel like it's one of those red-carpet airport clubs because it has the big fancy leather recliners with a large flat-screen TV, and another room in case you don't like what's playing in the main room.  It's got 3 computers for internet access, a couple of large round bar tables sitting just across a counter full of free food, sodas, hot dogs, baked goods, etc.  There's a section of 2 small TVs for PS2\/xbox, and a small room for young toddlers to keep busy.  The USO is always a place I go when I have time in between flights, even if I'm not traveling on official Army duty.  It's typically operated by volunteers, so I make it a habit to go sign in to show that it's being utilized.  Even if you're not in the military, you can still go up to the 2nd floor where the USO entrance is at, and usually find some free seating even when the downstairs chairs are all taken.

One funny thing about the Charlotte airport is how busy it was one moment, and then how deserted it was the next.  Our flight must have arrived some time after 9pm. After a quick stop at the Tequileria restaurant, we went to the USO and milled around a bit.  Then we came back downstairs right after 10pm, and most of the stores and the food court were closed.  It must have only been about 10-15 minutes where before the airport was bustling with people, to what seemed like a twilight zone episode.  

This airport is pretty nice because most of the shopping\/food places are centrally located. It was a fairly long walk to our gate for our connecting flight, but thanks to those jetson walkways, it didn't seem too far.

I don't know about other airlines, but US Airways at CLT looks overwhelmed. Multiple ""self service"" kiosks, half of which are down. If you need an agent, you will be directed to the kiosks repeatedly, which do nothing for you. If you have a checked bag and need to tag it, you'll be standing in line for a while because there are 3-4 agents for a couple hundred people checking bags. There will be several more agents not doing anything other than roaming around telling people to use the kiosks to check themselves in. 

TSA likes to run one checkpoint per concourse to slow things down. They also like to send one of the non-working employees back through that massive line to tell everyone to have their ID and boarding pass ready. But then of course you're not going to get that stuff looked at for 45 minutes because ONE employee is checking all of them. 

The concourse smelled of urine and feces, and was crowded beyond belief. No area in the restrooms to change a baby - appears to be intentionally devoid of flat counter surfaces and changing tables. I guess the message is if you have a child who isn't potty trained you aren't welcome at Charlotte-Douglas.

I'm still a bit bitter that I couldn't find a direct flight (I detest layovers), but was glad that I chose to fly into Charlotte as opposed to Atlanta.  I've heard bad things about Atlanta, so I wanted to avoid that airport at all possible costs.

We had an hour and 10 minute layover from our flight from Chicago.  There were no issues with that one in terms of getting off the plane (we didn't have to wait forever for a spot to open up) or getting to our next terminal.  I had plenty of time to read my book, relax and use the bathroom before my flight to Pensacola.  

The airport seemed fairly large, but easy enough to navigate with plenty of signs everywhere telling you where to go.  I also liked how the entrances to each concourse had a map with food\/shopping options as well as an estimate of time that it would take you to walk to another concourse.  That was super helpful.  Also, the concourses had moving walkways.  Personally, I love those things since they're faster than walking.  Do make sure to stand on the correct side so others can walk through!

The shops looked nice.  I saw a Lacoste, Pandora and Best Buy Express.  Personally, I'm not one to shop at the airport, if you are; the options seem pretty good here.  There were also white Adirondack chairs where you could sit and take a little break.

However, my 59 minute layover from Pensacola to Charlotte on my return trip to Chicago became a mere 20 minutes after waiting for a gate to open up (despite us arriving at the airport ahead of schedule) and having to walk to the new concourse\/terminal to get on our next plane.  I wasn't pleased, but the therapy dog I spotted and petted on the way kind of made up for it.

I've always had the joy of sitting down in a seat while waiting to board my plane since I always get to the airport early.  That wasn't the case when we got to our next gate and we had to stand around with others, which sucked.  Then, the woman calling the sections to board the plane called two together, which was just cruel.  A mad hoard of people made their way to the boarding area with their luggage.  *shakes head*

In retrospect, perhaps an hour layover wasn't enough time, but thankfully, we got there early enough (not as early as I could have liked, but whatever), so we didn't need to rush to get on our plane.

Bathroom wise, they've got attendants.  Like, what is that?!  O'Hare doesn't have bathroom attendants!  Needless to say, the bathrooms were super clean.  The attendants greeted passengers and were friendly.  There was a tray with peppermints and tampons along with a tip jar.

Overall, CLT's a decent airport.  I'd definitely fly into it again if for some awful reason I'm on a flight with a layover.  The airport was clean and easy to navigate.  However, I may up my layover time in case my flight has any issues since I don't want to be rushing and\/or miss my connecting flight.",11,2,3

Long term parking at CLT is dreadful.  I have never seen LT lot 1 or LT lot 2 anything but full.  Parking there is on heavy stone, not asphalt, great for tearing up wheels on your bag.  Lot lighting not working in many parking areas (security risk for your vehicle).  No signage for access to LT lot 4 until after arrival\/ departure terminal traffic; brainless; suggest bookmarking location on map app to facilitate local access instead.
TSA folks always playing with their phones at CLT instead of paying attention to anything important.  
One-way sign placed by geniuses at top instead off bottom at end of Term A; another genius configuration.  Only redeeming quality is that CATS bus service to\/ from airport to uptown central transit terminal is inexpensive and efficient; runs early and late.  
 No interview slot available at CLT Global Entry office for months; don't waste your $100 to apply; this is another government scam to take more money from each of us.

i Today all 3 long term lots were full before 1PM.  Go figure. TSA Pre-check line is nearly out the front door.  See photo posted today.

Lots of white rocking chairs sprinkled through out the terminals, so you can rest your feet and watch the flow of humanity ambling hurriedly across, light color tones is the paint scheme - which maybe psychologically is helpful in easing any perceived anxiety. Tons of shopping and food choices, so one can divert your attention to different things. I joke that this reminds me of the airport in Dubai - so I could call this an expensive shopping strip mall with an airport attached! :-) The restrooms are staffed - which is why I detect the hospitality theme was first and foremost in the airport operator\/planners mind.

There are tons of shops, cheap and expensive food, lots of walkways, rocking chairs...pretty much anything you would want in an airport. Staff tend to be competent, good Southerners - polite and helpful.

Long-term parking is easy to access and reasonably priced, and the staff is really helpful. I've had two good experiences with long-term parking. After parking my car for nine days in December 2008, my car refused to start. Within ten minutes, a mechanic was there to jump my engine free of charge. When I flew into there a few weeks ago, I had forgotten where my car was parked, and what my full plate number was. But with a vague description for customer service, they quickly gave me my car's location.

The first security checkpoint sometimes gets backed up, but there are four different checkpoints and one of them is usually pretty speedy.

That being said, it's still a fantastic airport that works efficiently to get you wherever you need to be.

Couple of highlights. Despite the chaos, traffic flows smoothly and enables you to get from terminal to terminal in a reasonable amount of walking time. Should you prefer to be transported via laziness, CLT has plenty of people movers to whisk you away. There are also plenty of food and shopping choices to tempt you on your gate to gate travels. It appears some of those restaurants might actually be pretty good!

Couple of lowlights. The motorized scooters in terminal E are deadly. I'm used to seeing people who actually need help taking these from gate to gate. Sadly, it seems that even the most spry of CLT take these as well, increasing volume and death probabilities. In addition, there seem to be a strange number of unoccupied airport workers just meandering around waiting for something to do. Maybe some of that cost could be reinvested in modernizing some of the airport facilities.

The delays weren't the fault of the airport itself, but rather the awful service of US Airways. When I was first stuck in this airport for over 5 hours because of a delayed flight, I wanted to charge my phone. Well, I don't know why they have so few outlets, but when you find one it's like winning the lottery. People were scouring the airport everywhere looking for outlets. We happened to find one and everyone in my group just used it in turns. I even saw some people sitting in the bathroom next to an outlet charging their phones and laptops.  The outlet situation is crazy!

I found the restaurant and food choices to be rather limited, but at least there was something. 

As we were flying back through Charlotte to catch out second flight, we had to go through immigration and customs, because we got off an international flight. As we made our way into immigration, the line wasn't super long, so many people just ducked under the ropes to avoid walking through many rows of empty lanes. These people didn't cut in front of anyone, they just wanted to avoid having to walk pointlessly through empty zig zag after empty zig zag of the line. There was a very angry woman who came running and yelled at everyone. She made them all get back out of lines and walk to the end. She then forced them to walk through each empty section of the line. They actually ended up in the EXACT position, since they hadn't skipped in front of anyone anyway.  This lady was crazy. She was all the talk in the Immigration line. She was definitely channeling Nurse Ratched (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest). We had hoped to get through immigration quickly as the line wasn't super long, but we were wrong. The immigration officers were awfully chatty and there weren't many of them. So, it took an exceptionally long time compared to the length of the line. Customs went much more quickly.

The new addition of the rental car parking deck has eliminated the need for a bus to get a rental. Genius move. Top notch facilities and lots of space leave you feeling welcomed and privileged to be renting a car.  The long term parking, however, is another story.

My closing comment is that either when departing or arriving, all of the runways are north\/south so you have an awesome view of the city if you're on the correct side of the plane.",0,0,0

I have to end up going through this airport in order to go to Boston, which is why I am so acquainted with this airport. I've never really had a problem until the last couple of years when I graduated from being a kid to being an adult which it wasn't required to have people wait on me as I got off the plane and stuff.

That's not why I have a problem, though. I do like that they have a variety of shops and food outlets to choose from, especially a full Chili's in the airport. However, I understand that it takes money and such to build a big airport instead of a small airport to become technology friendly through the building and inputting of charging stations and more outlets to deal with the amount of charging of phones and such people would need to do in-between flights. I just found it vastly annoying that there still wasn't a lot of charging stations or great outlets to charge my phone. Since this summer, I actually had to PAY for wifi which was outrageous for me since it's offered free wifi in the past. I don't know if it was just me, but I could not get my hands on wifi without some kind of payment.

The staff has been friendly as I don't think that the bathroom help is a nuisance and they do a good job. This summer, I was walking and a staff came about and asked if I wanted a ride since I looked tired so he called for a ride for me on the transport, which was great. I have had a pleasant experience as far as the staff was concerned. I even lost my ticket from Charlotte to Boston at one point and they just printed out a new one as soon as they saw my ID and everything. It wasn't a big deal and it was easy.

I just think they should fix their outlet\/charging problem and put in new charging stations and if it's true that you have to pay for your wifi now, then they should make it free again because it's ridiculous to pay for it when it's been free in the past.",1,0,0

The Good:
Security was fast and friendly. I was through the line in about 10 minutes, and cleared to go in about 20 total. I opt out of the body scanners, which takes a little longer but lessons the radiation I'm exposed too. I'm all about saving my future self from slowly dying of radiation poisoning after 20 years of going through body scanners. 
The airport itself is pretty- one of the prettiest I've been too. They have a tree lined terminal with giant windows on one side, risking chairs to sit and reflect, and lots of shops and even a spa to visit if you're laid over here (or misread your flight time and arrive three hours early like me). They have free wifi, clean facilities, a variety of food choices, and an overall friendly atmosphere. As I write this I'm seating in the waiting area by my gate, and the chairs are surprisingly comfy. Not your standard cold, hard, awkwardly uncomfortable chairs. 

The Bad:
Things are EXPENSIVE. By things I mean food and beverages. I know they jack up prices in airports, but $18 for two breakfast tacos and a sprite is absurd. That's like end of the world pricing. 
As I try to save this draft, I notice that their free wifi wont let me continue without an error message. I have since turned off my wifi and am on my phone's 3G instead. No problems anymore, but I think the wifi is useless if you can't navigate pages online. 
The woman who did my opt out patting down was a moron. Apparently she just couldn't grasp the concept that I was traveling with a laptop, a laptop bag, and a carry-on suitcase. I spent a good three minutes trying to make her understand that all three of the boxes\/tray\/item holders that people use to put their stuff through the X-ray were mine. A sample of our conversation:
Me: 'I have the laptop, the next container, and the black suitcase' :points to all three:
Her: 'the laptop is yours?' :points to laptop:
Me: 'yes, and the next two items' :points again:
Her: 'so not the laptop, this bag is yours?'
Me: 'the laptop IS mine, and the bag, and the suitcase. All of them are mine' :points again:
Her: 'so just the suitcase?'
OH. MY. GOSH. Are you an idiot???? How many ways do I need to say this for you to understand???? And you're supposed to be 'protecting' citizens from terrorists?? You can't grasp the concept of traveling with three items, what the hell are you good for? Unfortunately, I can't really curse out a TSA agent without facing potential black-listing, and as much as I enjoy the airport ('they have chairs....') I don't want to become a real life Tom Hanks and live in the airport. So I just shut up and let her figure it out, with the help of a coworker.

If you enjoy an airport that will turn off the people walkers during rush hour, then this airport is for you. If you love the A\/C being turned down drastically while there is 10,000 people running & sweating their butts off with you, come to Charlotte.

Just imagine Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport on a smaller scale, and you have Charlotte. While the amenities are reasonable, you may not have time to enjoy them if you are connecting with a flight that is 2-3 concourses away. There wasn't any noticeable in-airport train services, so you'll have to hoof it through the crowds.

It's where you go when you have to go somewhere. But on my Yelp homepage at the top, it's asking me if I've ever been and if I'd like to review it. I had some time on my hands so I figure what the heck. Let's talk about the CLT airport.

It's actually my second favorite airport in the US, Denver being the first. We can't compete with the Denver airport with its super cool art shops and the fact that during one four hour layover I had a full steak meal complete with bison ribeye and a bottle of red wine. CLT-Douglas doesn't have bison ribeyes. They do, however, have a Bad Daddy's... But without the bison. My hubs and I eat at Bad Daddy's in Dilworth for all of our burger needs and always ALWAYS upgrade to the bison. It's delicious and so much better for you than beef. So we were pretty excited to learn they were opening an airport location. Why the airport location cut the bison (and robust beer list) from their menu, I'm not sure. So in that case, I switch to the turkey burger, which is actually pretty juicy and delicious itself. 

But I digress - the airport... I really like our airport. It's clean, modern and easy to navigate. Security is rarely super bad, and if it is, you can hoof it down to either A or E concourses and usually get right in. I'm not going to say that every person I've encountered at a ticket counter was a ray of sunshine but I don't remember any particular incidents to count toward the negative. I love the rocking chairs, which are dispersed throughout the airport, usually in front of large windows so you can rock and watch the planes if you so choose. 

Another recent addition is Beaudevin, which I LOVE. It's an upscale sort of wine lounge, where you can chill on a chic sofa and sip on some wine, or get a snack if you're feeling peckish for something other than fast food. Even though it's right in the middle of the main thoroughfare, it still feels like a quiet escape. The décor is so very not-airport, with artsy chandeliers and those chic sofas I mentioned. (They do have table seating if you want to tuck into some food in a more serious manner.) 

They've added more charging ports in waiting areas now so that's a convenience. I don't think they have as many as some bigger airports do, but it's definitely better than it used to be when every one at the gate was competing to sit on the floor by the one wall outlet. Progress! 

If you're after Starbucks, the lines can get a little long and each location in the airport doesn't serve the same snacks. I waited in line at one and wasn't able to get the breakfast sandwich I so desired. (I would've honestly rather had an airport bloody mary to be honest but I was traveling with my boss for work on this occasion. Because that's part of the fun of airports - morning bloody marys because you can.)

There aren't any special shops I find the need to hit when I go to the airport like there are in Denver, but I kind of feel like this is a plus for my home airport. I'm there so often that it would cost me a lot of money to have a go-to shopping destination every time I travel. I get by just fine with the choice of Bad Daddy's (if I'm hungry) or Beaudevin if I just want to have a relaxing beverage while I wait for my flight. Sadly, I don't often have time to enjoy the rocking chairs, but I still like knowing they're there. 

Oh, and my dad introduced me to the valet parking and I haven't been able to go back to regular. Especially while they're working on the new garage construction. I'm too spoiled. Sure I could spend that money on a billion other things, and I should, but there's something just so fancy about being able to walk off the plane, pay a fee and have my car brought right to me. Because let's face it - nobody likes airport parking.",0,0,0

Douglas International is a medium-sized airport.

Upon arrival, I was able to easily follow the signs for 'public transportation' out to the end to locate the Sprinter bus that would take me into downtown (Uptown) for a mere $2.  One thing I liked about this bus is that at the start\/end points of the airport and the Charlotte Transit Center, there is only one stop so it's very easy to figure out where to go.  Returning to the airport, I reversed my route back into the baggage claim area and headed upstairs.

I got into the somewhat long security line at section C and was told that there was almost no wait if I headed further down to D, so I did - where I was told there was NO wait at section E.  So the only delay at security was the time it took me to navigate through the queue, which is always a great thing.  Even the TSA agents were pleasant and wished me a nice flight.  

Other positives about Charlotte include the availability of outlets and charging stations for electronics, free wi-fi, and a nice bright atrium area between the concourses.  Probably the worst part is that the gate area between the door and the walkway is fairly short and so as people line up to board their flight - especially if they are boarding at two gates opposite each other - the middle walkway becomes nearly impassable.

I would have no qualms about using this airport again.",3,3,4

I would like to give five stars, but it falls way behind in power charging stations and parking is a bit wonky as they redid the entrance.  Why would you need to drive by the terminal after you leave long term parking?!  #frustrating.   I'll stick to Uber.

I've spent the past 2.5 years flying out of my little puddle-jumper airport of TVC and although lovely, new, small and clean, it basically just flies to Detroit and Chicago (and other places nobody goes, like Ohio)- so I'm thrilled to be living in CLT for a bit and have a real, actual, international airport.

I flew in a couple of weeks ago and flew out yesterday- only to fly back on Friday to return to Charlotte. No complains during my arrival- luggage came relatively quick and my boyfriend illegally parked to pick me up with no problems at all. Hooray for illegal parking.

I was pleasantly surprised to find myself qualified for ""TSA pre-check"" or whatever during my Tuesday morning departure, which was great since I didn't have to take off my shoes, coat, or take out my laptop. Apparently I am a ""low risk"" traveler, maybe because I never beep when I go through security, fly several times every month or two and am a tiny blonde female. Who really knows.

In any case, security was a breeze and I quickly found my gate, right next to a couple of restaurants. I passed a Starbucks and other various breakfast spots on my way there, but was glad to find a breakfast sandwich place right next to where I was flying out of. Don't you hate when you find your gate and then realize all the good coffee and food spots are way way down the concourse? Me too.

I like this airport. It's not crazy big like ORD, it isn't spread out ridiculously like DTW and is not filthy like LGA. I think it's safe to say Charlotte Douglas is a little gem in the south east- not to mention only 10-15 minutes away from my current place.

As far as brief layovers go, CLT is pretty painless.  It's readily navigable with far superior signage to some other airports I've been through recently (MIA, I'm looking at you!).

I wish I had a Fitbit and could tell you how many miles I walked in this airport during my layover. 

Due to a missed connection at the fault of the airline, my friend and I ended up with some downtime here. Of course a valiant effort to catch the plane was made, however confusion over the correct gate would have squashed the 1% chance we had of making our flight anyways. 

So what do you do in an airport with a layover? Bar hop of course. We had some trouble finding the Carolina Beer company. Then we had some trouble finding Bojangles. We walked. A lot.

I'm obsessed with the food court\/nucleus with its white rocking chairs under real live trees and a ton of natural light and a beautiful view of the sunset ( with cool lighting if you come in on a later flight ). 

I was able to enjoy a live pianist playing contemporary songs once and thoroughly enjoyed it!

I usually walk to the end by concourse E to go through security.  Most of the flights out of here are USAir, yet the security gate by the USAir counters don't seem to staff accordingly.  The wait times can differ by 30 minutes.

ARRIVING:
Baggage will always be late here. If you're being picked up at night, have your ride pick you up on the top level where the departures are. There are very few flights departing at night and this area is usually empty.

CONNECTING\/WAITING:
There's enough to keep you occupied during a connection here. Most of the stores are lame and I don't know how you can have multiple outlets of Lids under one roof but they manage.

The livelier bar is the Bacardi bar on Concourse D towards the international gates. It looks to be the airport singles scene.  There's also a locking 'family' bathroom right by it. This is sometimes used by boozy travelers who are looking for an easier alternative to the mile high club. I am certainly not promoting it but just letting you know it happens. I prefer the atrium bar for the people watching.

Some of the public restrooms are staffed by attendants who solicit tips and maintain order, so bring your 1's and don't expect to run into your senator here. 

If you want to nap, the rotunda around the D gates again are usually the most vacant and should give you some space to spread out.  You also don't get the annoying beeping carts down here as much.  They do sweep the airport at night and make you leave the secured area so don't expect an overnight stay.  The airport is not in a nice area of town so all decent hotels are about a 15 minute drive.

EATING:
The restaurant lineup is constantly changing for better or worse.  The barbecue in the main atrium is an abomination.  My recommendation is the Bojangles which is on Concourse B.  They are even worse at math than most other Bojangles locations, so check your receipt or pay cash.",1,1,1

One US Airways Charlotte gate agents, Connie Owens, took it upon herself this morning to make our travel even more difficult, stressful, and inconvenient. I do not have sufficient words to express my absolute disgust and disappointment with Ms Owens' lack of compassion, flexibility and courtesy.  

We have flown with our daughter many times in the past eight years, usually taking US Airways because your crews have been unfailingly helpful, sympathetic and courteous.  Until now.  

Camille is now twelve years old, nearly 100 pounds, and almost five feet tall.  She is non-ambulatory, non-verbal, has autistic-like sensitivities, and often will require one or more diaper changes on a long flight.  Consequently, we always sit as close to the back of the plane as possible, as she is much too large to change in the tiny bathroom, and past flight crews have been very accommodating in arranging to either block off the aisle, screen off the last row of seats, or allow us to use the floor of the galley when everything is locked down After service.  

We were explaining this to the flight crew and Ms Owens when she took it upon herself to insist that that absolutely could not be done, that we were only allowed to change Camille in the bathroom, which is physically impossible, and to aggressively verbally berate my wife Christina over wanting to make some arrangement so that we could get to our destination with a minimum of discomfort and inconvenience to ourselves and our fellow passengers.  

Her aggression set off our daughter into a loud and prolonged screaming fit.  Rather than wait for the meltdown to pass, or to back off and give us a chance to calm our daughter, Ms Owens immediately contacted security to have us removed from the plane, which was unnecessary, humiliating, and a tremendous inconvenience.  

The security manager, Mike, was extremely kind, courteous and helpful as he assisted us from the plane, and consequently rebooked our flights for tomorrow, and set us up at a hotel near the airport. Nonetheless, this has made a difficult and stressful trip even more so, and has caused us to have to scramble to rearrange things at our point of arrival.  We are also stuck in a hotel without most of our luggage and some of our prescriptions. This has been, overall, a horrible experience, and certainly will make us think twice before flying US Airways or its affiliates again.  In addition, I cannot imagine that Ms Owens' actions were in any way acceptible per the ADA.  

I attempted to call to make and resolve this complaint, but the agent and supervisor I spoke with insisted that it could only be addressed through a web form, promising contact in one to three business days, which I find to be completely unsatisfactory. 

On the positive side, Yvonne J, another gate agent, was tremendously helpful and compassionate.  We also received assistance from an airport maintenance man, whose name I did not catch, in replacing a bolt on the wheelchair that broke as we were bringing it up the gangway.  

I would appreciate a response as soon as possible, which should include a plan of action for training your personnel to deal with the needs of disabled passengers.",12,0,0

Pros:
- Clean, spacious and brightly lit concourse

- Comfy rocking chairs with ready access to power in the main concourse

- Free and fast WiFi (when it's working)

- Lots of good restaurant options.  Try the seared Ahi Tuna at Phillips Seafood in Terminal C, its da best!

- All security lines enter into the main concourse, so you can pick any line at your leisure and still get to your required gate

- Rental car shuttles appear frequently, so you'll never wait for more than just a few minutes for a shuttle

- US Airways Exec Lounge is spacious and well designed

- Though I have not visited it personally, there's a wine shop that does tastings between the main concourse and the D&E gates.  That's a pretty good concept!

Cons:
- On busy travel days (esp Thursday afternoons) the security line can be unbelievably long

- Lack of portable food options.  The take-away sandwiches that they carry in the shops around the airport are always soggy, insipid and overpriced.  It's a bit messy and inconvenient to bring a slice of Sbarros or a Nathan's hotdog onto the plane with you

- Gates are spaced pretty far apart.  Trying to get from the E gate to the A gate will take you a good 15-20 mins.

- Due to the crowd, lots of windows, and size of the airport, it can get really hot inside during the summer


Overall, CLT is a well built and maintained airport.  Once you get past the long security lines, you'll have a variety of shops, services and restaurants available to you.  It's by far one of my top 3 favorite airports in the US.",3,2,3

I guess living on the West Coast and flying mostly United and Delta kept me from experiencing this sooner.  Seems Charlotte is a huge US Airways hub (in fact, *every* single airplane I saw here was US Airways).

The airport terminals are mostly standard, but they've got a good mix of stores and restaurants interspersed throughout, and everything seems cleaner and newer than I would have expected.  The main terminal is very large, open, and bright, with several restaurants and stores and even a guy playing a grand piano.  Wow!

With a couple hours to burn here, I tried to check out the Carolina Brewing Co in Terminal E, but they weren't opened for lunch.  Looks like a great terminal, though.  I stopped by the EA store and played NHL 2012 one of the PS3s they had in the store; what a great way to spend time between flights!!  Grabbing lunch at Bad Daddy's and watching some NASCAR on TV helped me feel like I was experiencing North Carolina a bit, too.",10,7,10

For the short duration that I was on the ground while waiting for my connecting flight, I was able to take a stroll around the different concourse and try two worthy eateries.  I satisfied my craving for some good ol' southern barbecue and washed it all down with a good pint of Carolina craft brew.  The airport is easy enough to navigate and quite organized compared with the airports that I'm used to in the Tristate area.  My favorite part, and what really gave it that southern comfort feel was the tree-lined main avenue that had numerous white rocking chairs to sit and relax while waiting for your next flight.  All I literally needed was a glass of fresh ice tea, a good book in hand, and a light breeze caressing my face and it would have been worthy of any southern romance novel.  I don't know if this is a daily occurrence but while I was sitting down at one of those rocking chairs an employee started playing on the piano near the center of the thoroughfare and made the whole experience that much more elegant.

Let's start from the BEST perk - free wifi - that rarely happens! Rocking chairs for you to people watch, a wine bar because travelers also love to drink & a newly added Courtyard by Marriott airport lobby.  The Courtyard by Marriott airport lobby is a new Marriottl Intl promotion, it's been going on for about 2 weeks, not sure how long it's going to last, but if you're in Charlotte airport be sure to check it out.  I visited the one coming out of concourse E. 

So what makes Charlotte a bit of a pain in the ass? Well...it's an airport - what more do you expect? Security lines suck - I've only had to experience them once thankfully.  Every freakin starbucks in that airport has ridiculously long lines, although the starbucks that I frequent has awesome service.  They know my order when I walk up! Charlotte could also use a train service like ATL or a people mover like IAD, trying to run from Concourse E, gate E32A to Concourse A, B or C is horrible....I swear it's like 2 miles & when you're running with luggage it's about 50 times worse.

Best shoe shine...right where ""D"" concourse security let's out so if you use ""E"" for TSA precheck go in and turn right at the Starbucks and walk down the isle and you'll see it on the left. It's money for shines, there is no set charge so you have to tip. I usually tip $10-$20 depending on my cash sitch at the time. There is another one at ""A"" security point but I have not tried it. 

Something to consider...just because your ticket says your gate is C etc. you don't have to enter at that security check point. So many people zombie at A for Delta or B\/C for American. Move down to D or E and you can access any gate from there but the security lines are way shorter and easier. 

Easiest Starbucks is the ""A"" concourse security point and they are fast but ""E"" security one isn't far behind. 

There are tons off new food places but most people hit the seafood\/bar place down in the ""C"" concourse. It's right by the burger place across the way and both are really good. If you need your Bojangle's fix it's down on C concourse at the end on the right. I hear the sushi place where the rocking chairs are in between B and C is really good. 

Don't bother with the free Wi-Fi as it sucks and clogged so stay on LTE. 

If you can get in one of the rocking chairs in between B and C and enjoy the people watching. 

Parking...3-6 days use the Daily East\/West Deck. Longer use the long term parking but allow an extra 15 minutes for travel to the airport. Be advised when you get back the Daily East\/West deck buses cycle through three times the rate as the others so it costs more but faster.",11,4,10

My flight from Tampa let out right near the gate of my connecting flight, which was great and convenient. I ran to the restroom, which was very crowded but understandable. I went into the only open stall, and noticed right away that the post on the back of the door to hang your bags\/purses was broken. I had my carry-on bag with me, which is a big cross-body bag that holds my laptop, tablet, phone, etc. So I had to awkwardly hold it on my lap while I did my business, instead of just hanging it up like in most restrooms, especially those at airports. 

However the most annoying thing about this airport was that the gates and seating areas were crammed into little corners. Not only making it hard to find a spot to wait, but it was almost impossible to hear them call your flight for boarding since many flights were departing around the same time, lines formed and it was just an absolute mess. The trash cans I saw in the seating area were also overflowing. People tried to throw out plastic cups and the like before their flight and at one point some of it just toppled onto the ground.

The Charlotte Douglas airport is one that I sort of dread in that it is so close to RDU that it seems like a complete waste of my time to be there in the first place. It is only about a 30 min flight to and from RDU so I am already frustrated when I arrive. I'll give you that. However, when I have a layover in Charlotte, which there are almost always delays and some issue, I find myself wishing there were more opportunities for shopping, better areas for lounging and hanging out, and better food options. Where is the fresh food for goodness sake? I spent 45 minutes of my 3 hour layover walking around, looking for something that did not look scary to eat.

-The whole point of an outlet is it to supply energy...none of your outlets do this..so what are they? Because, they certainly are not outlets. Three separate attempts in different walls (including a charge station proved fruitless. Sonofabitch!).

-Your courtesy people transporters make the most annoying, continuous whirling beep. Jesus Christ why?! Its obnoxious, but it fits your airport well I guess.

-Your employees are lifeless. I go in to get a protein bar, and the woman made 0% eye contact with me the entire time. When she said ""have a great day"", she must have been talking to the magazine rack.

You get two stars, go sit in think time and figure out how to call and hire an electrician who can re-wire your outlets. ALL YOUR OUTLETS...LOL.

Go sit in a corner somewhere and figure out how to properly run simple, basic crap. Like the people transporters...Get them to stop whirling like the Pope and Gandhi commandeered these vehicles, began grinding, and then left the alarm on demanding everyone watch them grind....

And finally, sit in a corner and figure out how to stop hiring vegetables. Look for people who can have the potential to smirk at me. Just a smirk. I am asking....for just a smirk. I am not that ugly...I think.

I understand they are expanding and going through some growing pains but I've been flying in and out of there for 12 years now.  With that being said, their ancillary services have always been horrible!  Specifically I'm referring to the baggage claim and transportation services.  Example, if you get your luggage within 45 minutes of arriving, consider this a blessing!  I typically have to wait nearly an hour, I've received better service in a 3rd world county.  Transportation and bus's to parking, this is heinous at best, this past Saturday I had to walk to the daily E\/W parking because there were no busses, I waited for over 30 minutes and even begged the attendant 2 times!   I felt bad disturbing her cell phone usage or texting sessions.  I really feel the management of this area needs to kick their employees in the ass, they are rude and extremely lazy.

But cannot be compared to some of the more bigger airports given the International Status. Still, this has to get 4 stars because it is so much better than some of the airports on the east coast. 

For someone who has not been into the city but used this airport as a transit point only, here are some of the good things about this airport:

- The Layout: The design of the terminals is very conducive for travelers who have short durations between connecting flights. All the 5 terminals - A through E fork out of a central point. So the farthest you will have to sprint would be from terminal A to terminal E if luck has it's way with you and dispersing your incoming and outgoing flights that far apart. Even that running time can be minimized significantly thanks to the mechanized walkways that are all over the place. I experienced this first hand. Any US airport with International status and without these walkways should be deemed Ancient and up for reconstruction.

- Restaurants \/ Food Options: This airport is very true to it's southern stylings. Other than the standard fast food and chain restaurants that one is used to seeing at airports and their food courts, it was good to see some local flavors mixed with many an international (even though primarily latino) options to choose from when it came to the restaurants here at Charlotte Douglas.

- Security \/ Check ins: I found these to be rather stress free and in fact less crowded than most US airports I have been through. While getting off from the incoming International flight, the immigration check point lines moved as fast as I have seen - and it has only been made more efficient thanks to the introduction of the security pre-clearance kiosks installed before you are assigned to the immigration officer.

- Gates: Again, this goes with the layout. But I did have to mention that most gates with active flight status were pretty well staffed and I had no trouble getting any of my questions clarified for my outgoing flight that was delayed by an hour. At this point my expectations from domestic carriers are fairly minimalistic.

All in all, a rather good experience using CLT.",1,0,1

The amenities here, first off, are great. The wi-fi is free, fast, and maintains a good connection throughout the airport. The main concourse is also the most picturesque scene from any airport I've visited - it's essentially been modeled as a classic Southern city downtown scene, with a walkway lined by trees, rocking chairs, and retailers, with lots of ambient light, to boot. The food options at CLT are also very good, and it helps to have a Starbucks in each concourse. 

The only down-side about CLT is that, since it's all one large terminal, you have to do a lot of walking if you're coming off a flight in one concourse and headed to a connection in another. If you're really in a hurry though, just flag down airport staff and they'll be happy to give you a lift.

I may understand people to complain how this once humble and low-key airport has grown into this major hub, but it's honestly a great airport.

From a functionality standpoint, this is actually one o the best airports I've ever been to. Betwen the moment I lzft the plane and got my suitcase, barely 20 minutes had passed. Talk about efficiency! This resulkts in this airport being actually great for layovers. I have not been through border controls here, but from what i've heard it's astonishingly swift. Also, the staff members here are honestly some of the nicest, most courteous people I've seen at an airport (and given that many were US Ariways employees, that's saying a lot). Finally, there are so many eateries here. I got to the airport early for a morning flight, and got a stunning breakfast there.

But I do indeed have two concerns with CLT. First off, there are far too many constructions going on, which ruins the scenery. I understand that it is a rapidly growing airport (it's US Airways' largest hub) and that it is expected to grow even more in the near future with a large increase in European destinations, but the management of the airport should be more organized with its growth. Then, the different piers\/terminals are ridiculously laid out. This is the kind of airport where you may have to run from one end to the other to catch a connecting flight.

The TSA agents are usually pretty cheery here, which is always nice when you're toting a fussy (or talkative) toddler through the checkpoint.

I only wish there were a few more food and drink options outside of security.  Currently there's a Starbucks on the top level by the departure desks, and that's about it.

The center section (the ""hub"" area from which the gates extend) is really nice - I love the window wall and the rocking chairs that are lined up perfectly for people watching, book reading, and relaxing. The chairs are right across from the famous piano, and I actually had a relaxing, great time rocking and listening to a volunteer pianist play.

I'm a fan of the airport. It's small enough to easily navigate through - but I live in the Charlotte area, so I never have to use it as a ""travel thru"" city.
TSA is not an issue for me, but I also have Global Entry \/ Pre Check. The only thing that annoys me is how narrow it is - when the people waiting to board their planes stand in the hallway \/ walk way and block you from being able to get to where you need to go.
The food is actually decent here (I have been to a few spots, but avoid the food court type of food. Sushi is actually decent as well). The wine bar is a nice spot that easily allows you to forget that you are in an airport. The rocking chairs are nice, and with all the windows it feels nice and open.

If we cannot get a flight out of Greenville then Charlotte International Airport CLT is our next airport of choice.  Charlotte is not too far from Greenville and often has great tickets.  We try to always leave a little bit earlier than we anticipate because with traffic and the occasional rain shower it can slow you down.  Plus we typically park in the long term parking and catch the shuttle to the airport so that takes  a little more time then a quick drop off at the airport.

On our last two big trips we flew out of Charlotte International Airport CLT.  One of our trips was up to New England and the Midwest and our most recent trip from Charlotte was to Anchorage, Alaska.  The Charlotte airport can be a little busy on Friday afternoons and evenings.  It took us longer than normal to find a parking spot in long term parking.  We were beginning to think the lot was completely full, but we found one eventually near the end of the lot.  Once we found a spot to park and got all our luggage out of the van we immediately made our way to the canopy to wait for the next bus to arrive.  Thankfully they have a bus pick up people every few minutes.  The first bus that arrived at our canopy location was completely full so we had to wait for the next bus which we could see coming down the road.  They had a bus probably every 2 to 6 minutes going through the parking lot.

The long term parking bus drops you off at the basement level and directly across the walkway from the check in counters.  Once you get into the airport you'll need to take either the escalators, stairs, or elevator up to the 2nd floor to check into your airline and drop off your luggage.

We've had great experience even during the busier times of getting through the check-in lines fairly quickly and smoothly.  You can go through any of the TSA check points because all the terminals merge immediately after the check points.  We typically pick the TSA line with the shortest line or one with the most open lines at the time.  As long as you follow the TSA guidelines (take off your shoes if over 12 years old, no liquids, etc....) you should get through pretty quickly.  The terminals are well marked and easy to get to as well.  If you are looking for a snack, drink, or restrooms they have a number of options and locations just outside the main terminals as well as along the terminals.

It can get crowded at times, but we've always had good luck flying out of Charlotte.  The employees are friendly, professional, and do their best to get you on and off your plane in a timely manner.  They do not have any control over the weather, but otherwise we've had no issues.  Thankfully this flight was the same.  Quick, easy, and on time!  Thank you CLT!

Although there are a lot of food options, the lines are pretty long.  I guess that can't be helped, but a lot of the employees--and there seemed to be too many at each store--seemed to be running around but not really doing anything.  I didn't really like that all the choices were pretty terrible chains, but what else could I have expected?  At least most things seemed clean.

The terminals and gates themselves are very clean.  Because I had so much time, I walked through a lot of the airport.  One of my favorite parts about my layover was seeing a US Airways plane that was painted with the old PSA colors, including the smiley face on the nose.  Now, I don't particularly like US Airways, but that brought back some serious childhood nostalgia, although as I remember PSA only flew the planes with the engines on the tail and the wings really far back.  Oh well.

The actual gate employees here were very friendly and helpful.  I watched them help a lot of people with questions.  In fact, I was shocked at how well they kept the lines moving while still being courteous to bumped and standby passengers.

There are 5 security checkpoints so the wait is never too long. They all lead into the center or heart of the airport which is essentially a food court.

There is a ton of construction going on, mostly with parking and the roads leading into the airport. It seems like for the past year or so, every time I go to the airport they are re-routing you a different way. It will be nice when it's all said and done. 

My biggest gripe about the CLT airport is that it is a US Airways hub so you would think you would be able to get great deals on flights out of here that may even be a direct to your destination, right?

The white rocking chairs are in high demand but they are worth a wait because the rocking sensation soothes you during your wait. 
The gates are very close together with the walkway being narrow which made for very hectic and crowded departures and arrivals. It felt like cattle being loaded onto the plane.

My honey and I had all of our research license paperwork in order for the Cuba portion of our travels in case we were asked for it** but the not-even-a-hello immigration officer guy just scanned our passports, looked at us with his best stern face, and stamped us on our way.

Fine! Don't take my money! I gave up on actually sitting anywhere and just got takeout at the BBQ spot in the center of the terminals. 

Did I mention how ridiculously crowded it is? Normally when you have a layover, you can quickly stand to the side and look up your next gate on your phone, or at least reorient yourself enough to find the departures screen (short people problems). Nope, the flow of traffic and the narrow halls don't allow that. I noticed wheelchair users having a hard time getting though without assistance too. 

There were not enough outlets here as indicated by the immediate poaching of my outlet spot when I got up to go to the restroom. There are around 20 for the whole end of the terminal, and people were willing to stand or sit on the ground to use them. Not ideal for a major transfer airport notorious for delays. 

A couple I waited in line with had actually missed their 2pm flight because they didn't hear the announcement.

CLT it the best hub in the US. its a walking airport that has lots of moving walkways. I'm as swift as an NFL Running Back in this place but throw in those walkways and I'm Hall of Fame material. CLT has many cool places to eat and drink and the price points are reasonable. The waiting areas are always clean and there's no tattered seats. You can always find an outlet to charge your electronics and the bathrooms are always clean. One note is (and this is just a personal observation) I'm not a big fan of the bathroom attendant. I'm not looking for pleasantries when I'm having a whiz. Really! who eats mints from the toilet? GROSS! The true fact is these guys keep the lavatories clean. I am just not chatty when I'm peeing.
On the occasions when Charlotte is my destination the baggage claim is super fast and efficient. Security is never a hassle and the check in at the ticket counters are friendly and always super nice.
I normally fly 1st class so we get an elevated level at the counters anyway. You should try it, nothing beats getting hammered on a 6am flight to Tulsa.
CLT is in my opinion the best big hub airport in the country.",2,1,0

I'm not sure how big this airport is, but after taking a stroll throughout the whole facility, I saw that every terminal was bustling with people. Seats were filled up and many people were standing up while waiting for their flight.

Restrooms are fairly clean -- I like how there are attendants there ensuring that the sinks were dry and that there are paper towels in every dispenser. Hey, they even have a basket of candy there, too. I'm surprised some US airports have that -- I usually see attendants in overseas airports.

Most of the airport staff members are friendly. Shop owners were also friendly to talk to while shopping for a few things. The selection of restaurants, however, isn't too great. Then again, if your layover isn't too long, that shouldn't be too big of an issue.

There's free WiFi but it takes forever for me to connect, whether on my iPhone or my Mac. Also, this airport needs more charging stations; there aren't enough to go around for the thousands of people who go through the terminals.

The first time was 3 years ago prior to being a Yelper and, I had experienced several delays, and was late to my destination. However last week, I visited NC and went through there twice to make connecting flights. 

First I must say the amenities and the sheer number of options of restaurants and shops is impressive for a small airport. They have fried chicken places, vegetarian restaurants, a bookstore, nail salon, almost anything you can think of needing here. It's well kept and clean, and the bathrooms were nice. They also have free wifi and rocking chairs which are a pretty neat feature of the airport. 

However, the biggest issue I had with this airport is that getting to the other side of the airport was a slow and arduous process. It's kind of small, and during rush hours and in consideration of making a connecting flight, it can become very cumbersome to travel through. The reason why this is is because it is much smaller compared to others and its aisles aren't very wide. Yet at the same time, they have these large transports going around ferrying people to their destinations. Not a problem, except they stop traffic behind them sometimes and make it difficult to get past them because of the rush. I was also upset that the woman driving an empty one was moving so slow and stopping to chat with people when in fact I was trying to get past her and couldn't because the traffic going in the other direction was moving fast. I think they need smaller transport vehicles here, because bigger is certainly not better as far as this airport goes. 

As for the staff here, they are ok. A bit rushed at times, and as I said earlier, there was a woman who held me up and almost made me late for my connecting flight which was at the opposite end from where I landed. 

Overall, this isn't a bad airport, I just had some bad experiences here. Just be sure to give yourself much more than a 45 minute to an hour layover time.",2,0,0

It got to the point where I had to pull up the statement on the AA website to prove to her that I paid. I was humiliated as the woman made such a scene. I was flying first. By the time she was done attacking me, the entire plane was already loaded and all overhead compartments were filled (even the first class cabin) and the flight attendants had to reshuffle to accommodate my bag. 

Terminal Service:  Somewhere in terminal E around gate 12 there is a woman who works at one of the open shops who CONSTANTLY sings. She sings and sings and sings. If it's a Monday, she sings a song about Monday, if it's raining she sings about the rain. It's nice and friendly, I get it however if your sitting in the gate area, it's becomes uncomfortable and annoying. I bought a water and a magazine and she sang about the entire process as I was checking out to the tune of jingle bells ""coming to the check-out lane, looks like you found sumthanggg""..... It was torture. 
Shopping\/Amenities :  Decent. I give the airport 2 stars due to the nail salon, they do excellent work in a short amount of time and also give great chair massages. They have shops like Brooks Brothers, Johnston Murphy, Erwin Pearl and the like. 

Restaurants:  Disappointing. I usually only go to the Mexican restaurant for the black bean soup. Other than that, it's just a bunch of chains. 

Like I said, this airport is always an experience. Unfortunately if I want to go home, I have to fly through here so it's unavoidable.",2,0,0

Now that they've merged with American, it still serves the same. The airport is kinda big so wear proper shoes. Also, this airport is notorious for not having gate agents ready when you land and your flight already arriving late so be prepared for the run of your life (your two flights are never anywhere near each other). I'm pretty sure I unknowingly have assault charges because of this airport. I have had to run from E50 to B15 in business shoes toting a business roller and using every moving runway more times than I can count. My FloJo moments involved me shoving the elderly, children, workers, etc as I only had 10 minutes to make my next flight's boarding. That's what this airport is about. I owe my weight loss to this airport because I'm almost certain that my run is about 1\/2 mile. 

My only request is mile markers and I'm so serious. I'd like someone to tell me how far I've run when I've busted a move from this gate to that gate. I'm counting calories and I need to know! 

There are decent food options here, but my fav place to visit (when I have a decent layover between flights) is the Terminal Gateway Spa near the D\/E gate terminal. I'd much have a massage than eat. Oh and the addiction of the MAC cosmetics store.... yass!!! 

I'm trying to think of how this place could be better. They have sushi, froyo, fried chicken, a spa, cosmetics store... maybe a bulk candy store?! If they get a bulk candy store and a Rita's Ice, I'd move in. Like seriously, forget my connecting flight... I'm staying here FOR-EVER!!",4,5,0

While I have had both flights terminating at CLT as well as connecting through CLT, it's more often the later for me, on numerous USAirways and AA flights.

I think that CLT has a unique ""large airport with a down home vibe"" going for it. Even when I arrive at E gates and have less than an hour to connect to a flight at A or B gates, I don't shudder with terror as I would if having to cross 3-4 concourses, like I would in an airport such as ATL. With CLT, there is a central ""hub"" that serves as the connecting point for A-E gates. For me, getting from the very end of E to the very end of B took only 15 minutes, and I even had time to stop at Hissin Sushi in the other ""hub"" between A and B gates. Great success!

You'll love the plethora of white rocking chairs, clean, bright layout of the walkways, and the plentiful stores and restaurants. Restrooms are easy to find, well-stocked, and constantly kept clean by in-restroom staff that offer you paper towels, mouthwash, and mints, call you honey and darling, and work for tips.

Wanna walk from point A to point B? Well, don't be in a hurry, because there are 5 million (slight exaggeration) people in your way.

BUT, they have decent restaurant options, and plenty of them. On top of that, the people in the international area are about as nice as they can be: One of them actually called me ""sweetie"". I almost broke down crying because it was so nice to be treated so well after spending several months out of the country. I am telling you... the customer service in the United States is beyond. And the CLT is top notch!

Additionally, the airport is pretty small, all things considered. I was at the very end of terminal B when I arrived. Had to head to D, which was the opposite side of the airport. I think that with all the foot traffic, it took me a whopping 10-15 min. Not too shabby... but I will admit that I am a master maneuverer, and walk with relaxed-looking lightning speed. So maybe add a little extra time for the lollygaggers. Nice thing is there're some little shops there in the middle. Relax, check it out. Then be on your merry way.

OH! One last pointer: AWESOME place to come in internationally... it took me like 3 seconds (again, slight exaggeration) to get through customs. There were plenty of lines, re-entering through security was also well-organized.

Bottom line: the place is relatively clean, easy to navigate (in comparison) and is almost done up-fitting the retail to come up to the current trend of ""mall-like"" experiences.  

All terminals are span out from a center like the hub and spoke system of the airlines.  The center court in the middle is best known for its cluster of shoppes, restaurants and (best loved) row of white rocking chairs that ironically back up to the people-mover walkways.  People watching, alone, is worth the price of admission and the vast open space feels busy and energetic during prime time, but never stuffy.

E Terminal is they newest and definitely feels so. If you fly international from Charlotte, you will be there.  Seems there is a bigger selection of stores here but all terminals have some options.

For those parking at Charlotte, you've got the usual choices of hourly, daily, long-tern and remote- each with successive price decreases but increasing distances from the terminal.  A flurry of busses constantly circuits from the lots to the terminal and, unless you arrive late at night, are plentiful and well-marked.  After hours we have much better success contacting an airport employee to let them know which bus we fare looking for.  Just remember where you park- long term one is very different from long term 2!

For those wanting a higher level of service, there is also terminal level valet and business valet.  While I get the convenience of pulling up to the terminal and dropping off they keys, I do not understand the business valet- it is further away than remote parking and you still have to ride a bus.  Yes, they will change your oil and clean the car (for an additional price) but the premium you pay here does not justify the product.  My advice: skip business valet entirely.

Otherwise, CLT is a typical airport but modern, clean, and open enough to make your time there easier to enjoy.",1,0,0

My family and I have been here multiple times in the past two years, as this airport is a hub for US Air. We've been here when it's been quiet and also when it's been teeming with people. When quiet, it's lovely: there is an airy, open central food court that has a lot of light and open space. There are some neat art pieces and mobiles\/suspended kinetic sculptures which are cool, and rocking chairs in which to relax. The airport's signage is clear and everything is really well-marked. The airport itself has always been really clean whenever we've been through it. There are many bathrooms and all are clean, too. Each bathroom has an attendant who offers mouthwash and mints and various supplies (you either appreciate or don't, these bathroom attendants. For me, they've all been pleasant, wishing me a nice day, and there's never been pressure to use their supplies or tip them, so I don't mind them. I find them to be a throw-back to an earlier, more refined time. I can understand others being off-put by them, though).

What's not so great is the lack of stores and better restaurants here (this can be problematic when you have a longer lay-over here), and how the place is a total cluster-f**k when it's busy. It just seems like the US Air terminal isn't large enough to accommodate all the people they service at busier ""rush hour"" times. I've seen people literally trip over each other, trying to catch connections, when it's busy. The terminal perhaps should have been made larger or wider, so more people could more safely move about.

(As a side note, I think it foolish to downgrade this airport's ratings due to flights being delayed or cancelled, as some reviewers have done. The timeliness of flights run by all the various airlines is often - usually - not controlled by the airport. That's like blaming a mall for one of it's store's questionable return policies. It's not the mall's fault. Just my two cents worth!).",2,1,0

Cons:
It has really expanded into a very busy airport, it is way more crowded than it was 4 years ago. Too many people for my liking.
It is the hub for US Airways and thus flights in and out are frequently delayed, as I have experienced too many times to count on this airline. I have never experienced so many delays as at CLT.

Heading towards the terminal building, a few things became apparent:
1) Some parts of the airport haven't been touched in years. Others are just fine.
2) US Airways is the dominant carrier.

The terminal itself is reasonably modern with adequate signage, moving sidewalks, a variety of shops and restaurants, dozens upon dozens of the aforementioned rocking chairs and scattered power outlets.

1. Free and functional (the latter is extremely important) wi-fi. 
2. The concourse is clean, bright, and full of nice folks who want to provide help.
3. The signage is clear. 
4. US Air did its best to delay me, but my checked baggage was ready in seconds.
5. The rental car shuttle departed immediately, despite us being the only people on it.
6. There are rocking chairs. 
7. I only had to elbow one old woman in the head to get through the crowd (clearly everyone else learns quickly).  

Also, Charlotte appears to be lightyears ahead of us in eco-friendly technology as well. Bike shares, solar-powered parking meters, electric carports, recycling bins everywhere...in the airport in particular, I appreciate the reusable water bottle taps at the fountains.

There is a chapel for prayer, a room for mothers, a full wall of windows with white rocking chairs underneath.

As soon as I realize that my connection goes through Terminal E, My mood immediately shifts into stress mode because the terminal is always crowded, and it is a ridiculously long walk from the other terminals, so be ready to run to catch your flight if you fly into Terminal A or B and connect in E.  In addition, there aren't any decent restaurants or bars in E to pass the time if you have a longer layover, and the terminal is insanely HOT (at least 85 degrees in E today)! I can't begin to understand why the airport doesn't add a tram or something to transport travelers to Terminal E more quickly, and I am also at a loss as to why they don't fix the air conditioning.

One other beef that I have with the Charlotte Airport is the lengthy lines that planes must go through after pushing out of the gate before taking off. As an American Airline frequent flyer, the other options for connections are even worse than Charlotte (Washington DC, Philadelphia, & Chicago).

There is only junk food and 2000 calorie meals to be had anywhere, which is a standard Charlotte meal judging by the waistlines here. Bring an apple and try to keep your layover to a minimum.

But I want to stress that I would rather fly through Charlotte than almost any other airport because of the outstanding chances that my flight will be on time. Charlotte saves me time over airports like Philly or O'Hare because I rarely miss a connector. That is, after all, the whole point.

We arrive in Charlotte with 45 minutes to get off the plane, collect our luggage, recheck our luggage,  go through security and board before our connecting flight takes off. It's one crazy mad dash which we amazingly make in time but not before the a$$holes at security deliberately pick out all of those in rush and send us through the full body scanner! Pi$$ed off is an understatement. Should we have had time we would have told them ''hell no!''. I guess they have targets to hit and knew we really had no choice - it was go through or miss our flight. Or so we thought..

After the sprint through the airport and board the plane with minutes spare we got told the flight would then be delayed at least an hour. The pilot said it could be 2-3 due to ''bad weather in San Francisco'' but would see if he could get the time down.
Really? There was no bad weather in San Francisco. Apart from being a bit cold it was actually a very still and fog free night (I checked on my cell). Passing the blame for the airport effing up is not cool. 

An hour went by and it's declared we're ok for take off but then proceed to sit on the runway for almost another hour! I don't know what the problem was but they didn't even bother to tell us, it's like they had just given up trying to make excuses. 
We finally got back to SFO almost 2 and a half hours later than we were meant to thanx to whatever issues Charlotte were clearly having that night.

One bad experience out of 4 or 5 isn't so bad though, generally the airport is pretty good. 
Seating in the terminals is ample but the chairs are not so comfortable so I recommend heading to the center of the airport where all the terminals meet. That's where they keep the comfy rocking chairs and where all the eateries and shops are. Places to eat include Chilis, Burger King, Papa Johns and Pinkberry.
Restrooms here are nice too and is one of the few airports I have visited that still have assistants. Lovely ladies that supply you with breath mints, sanitizer and a spritz of perfume.

To preface, I am somewhat biased because I live here and I've seen the explosion of growth throughout the last 20 years and what this airport has become. I remember when there were dilapidated buildings, shady areas around the airport and overall the area looked depressing and uninviting. However, now CLT offers a great improvement on parking, daily, long term and valet. The airport signs are still a bit confusing unless you used to them and know exactly where to go. The look and feel of the outside terminal and surround area has received a much needed upgrade even though I really miss how Queen Charlotte looked so stoically over the airport. 

Once you get inside the terminal, the signage and security gates are well marked and if you're TSA pre check then it's a breeze, on the other hand, regular security is tedious, long, and somewhat intrusive but that's the price you pay for being safe or having the presumption of being safe. The ticket counters have mostly been replaced by DIY self check in which seems to cut down on wait times and you can weigh your bags to make sure you not over the weight limit. Charlotte Douglas has greatly improved the selection of shops and restaurants over the years and the decor inside is more modern and up to date. As always, when you're at CLT, you feel like you at home with the well placed seating, rocking chairs and big open spaces. Getting from gate to gate is mostly a breeze unless your connecting flight is minutes apart then it seems like an eternity to make your next flight. 

When you make it back home to CLT, you'll see the baggage claim area has seen some minor upgrades, but nothing spectacular, I really hated the ugly carpet which has renovated and now replaced with clean tile. They got rid of the rental car counters which has opened the space a lot and made it look less cluttered. Again, my review is somewhat biased because I live here and I take a lot of pride in my city but Charlotte Douglas has earned it 4 star rating.",20,12,15

It is a really beautiful airport and the smell of southern BBQ is all through out. Shuttle and nice, not over whelming. Except when you go to the International side it seems sterile and clean, then as you keep going towards the gates it gets dark, like they dim the lights.

One of my sisters has lived in Charlotte for the last 3 years- making that a common drive.  Then I moved to Memphis.  The drive got a wee longer.  Then I moved to Denver- no way in hell I am driving from there!

Then I found out one of my ex-gfs that I have some bad blood with (and I don't even know why, but whatever) works out of CLT for US Airways, I had absolutely no intention of ever visiting this airport.  I am better off just flying to ATL, and then driving.

However, this past weekend, I didn't have that option.  I actually had to fly.  I burned some skymiles to make the journey.  Since I was flying Delta, there was not a direct flight from DEN, I opted to fly through MSP.

When I arrived to CLT, it seemed like a cozy airport.  It looks like Delta is based out of A terminal, which is nice and small (and easy to get to).  There is a walkway taking you to other parts of the airport via foot or moving walkway.  During that small walk, they have a bunch of posters of movies that had been filmed in Charlotte- a cool little piece of history.  

At the end of the walkway, they have a small observation area with rocking chairs you can watch the runway and other gates, if that is your thing.  

Exiting was a breeze, and I got picked up in no time.  I was surprised though to not see traffic people kicking idle vehicles out of the way.

When it was time to return, my mom dropped me off as she was on her way to drive back to Atlanta. This was Monday morning.  You would think the place would be a zoo, but it wasn't!

One thing I did notice, was the amount of on-site parking, and how cheap it was!  5$ a day long term parking!  By far, that is the cheapest long term parking I have ever seen!  I do know they have plenty of shuttles to that will take you to\/from the terminal.

I went back to A terminal, which was easy- there were only 5-6 people in front of me at the security line.  It looks like each terminal has its own security line.  That is helpful in terms of keeping the flow of things smooth.

For getting picked up and dropped off, this is a pretty simple airport.  I noticed too they have plenty of Starbucks, a NASCAR vehicle for show, and even a Wendy's with a breakfast menu.  For a quick in and out, this place seems to do a solid job!",6,3,6

They're expanding it and it's a mess. Upon arrival, I didn't enjoy having attendees in the bathroom, I'm a big girl, don't need help, it's demeaning to have people do such jobs. Restrict that to helping older people.

Exiting the airport is a chaos, worse than LAX, same with crossing the street. Inside the parking lot (under construction), one elevator wasn't working, so we stayed in line to wait to get on the only one working. Exactly what you want to do after a long flight.

When departing, we got lost, they had a tiny sign, handwritten about finding the Departures.

The American Airlines machines didn't accept our credit card, at the counter, people who work there need a bit more manners.
Same with the TSA people. Where is your Southern hospitality, people?
Our gate was at terminal B, but the TSA lady didn't let us go there, made us got to terminal A. What a mess here, small space, inefficient TSA people, rude, slow, nightmare! These people need a bit of training, learn how to be nicer and organize things better. Very unpleasant!

Some OK food choices, some not so healthy, if you have time, browse.

Between 4\/4\/2009 and today, I've departed from or arrived at this airport over 100 times. I've also gotten a couple of gate passes to escort my daughter through security.

CLT is still a good airport for layovers. Lots of restaurant options from a fancy wine bar to a sit down burger joint, plus a full spectrum of fast food. The main atrium even has a pretty good barbecue spot if you're looking for Carolina 'cue and can't leave the secure zone.

For those departing from CLT, you can use *any* of the security checkpoints. Unlike some airports (Newark), once you're inside Charlotte you can go to any gate. The line at A is usually pretty long, so feel free to wander up to B or C if they look shorter.

Southwest, United and Delta are in the A concourse. American is also there but might be moving as a result of the merger. JetBlue and Lufthansa are in D, I believe.

Tips:
- Rental car franchises are not located in the terminal - you do have to catch your company's shuttle bus.
- There's not a smoking lounge inside the secure area. You have to go outside and follow the signs.
- B and E checkpoints have TSA Precheck lines. Other checkpoints have ""elite"" security queues which are not specific to just US Airways. Any elite passenger is allowed to use it!

This airport obviously has a problem with theft by their employees ...please be aware of this!!
Southwest  Airlines apparently has no liability for this!!

Problem with this place is simple: it's way too crowded and it doesn't know how to handle it.

Years ago, before ever considering living in Charlotte, I flew through CLT on my way to Vegas (from Orlando).  I was very impressed by CLT's cleanliness, wide open spaces, and modern feel.  And we loved the look of having the row of white rocking chairs in the main terminal; it really created a friendly atmosphere.  My traveling friend and I both said, ""Why don't we fly through Charlotte more often?""  Living here, now I understand why: unless you fly USAirways, you will most likely never fly through CLT.  USAirways has the monopoly on CLT and pretty much regulates the pricing on flights to and from Charlotte.  

The airport has a nice collection of restaurant options, but I've often had very early morning or very late flights and been unable to enjoy them because they don't operate on the same schedules as all flights.  The airport could use a few more stores to occupy your time, too, but I guess that's all part and parcel of being an airport.  At least they have some bookstores and a couple of Starbucks.

A few things that the airport does have the capacity to improve on, though, are (1) the baggage delivery, (2) the services outside of security, and (3) parking.  CLT has THE slowest baggage delivery I've ever seen an any airport.  Expect to wait 30-45 minutes for your bag.  If there are two of us traveling, one waits for the baggage while the other gets the car.  That way, we're not waiting an hour and a half, only 45 minutes.  

If you're waiting at CLT for someone to arrive, there is NOTHING for you to do.  No restaurants, no shops, no nothing.  If their flight is delayed, you're out of luck, my friend.  You can wander upstairs to the ONE Starbucks, but then you have to fight the crowd of travelers vying for their place in line.  Plus, when you're waiting for someone, you get to wait near the baggage claim with no windows, depressing lighting, and a low ceiling.  How dreary.  And what a ""first impression"" that person gets.  Ick.  

Lastly, the parking.  While it's nice that you can pay to park there pretty cheaply compared to other airports (it's up to $4 a day now), you'll wait for shuttle service to and from the airport.  Allow an extra 30-45 minutes onto your time.  Holidays are insane; you're lucky to find any parking at all.  And paying more for closer parking doesn't mean you have any faster shuttle service, so you might as well park farther out.  Recently, I got to the airport and a sign said, ""All lots open.""  However, when I got to the two main remote lots, they were both closed (even though I could see empty parking spaces).  There were no signs to the one open lot that I didn't even know existed (row ""Z!""), but I happened to find my way there after trial and error.  I felt like I was parking in a field and I felt sorry for the person working the one toll booth there because they had no contact with civilization at all, no overhead in case it rained, and newspapers taped to the windows to allow some privacy and block the extreme sun from coming in.  Odd.  For a modern airport, the parking has a backwoods feel.

Overall, I rate the airport high because it is much nicer than a lot of airports I've been to, but I had to take at least one star away because of the fixable problems they have.",0,0,0

Now I really don't consider myself a travel snob, but spending any amount of time in an airport (especially these days), requires three things . . . friendly airline staff, decent \/ affordable food and, perhaps most importantly, electrical outlets for charging our ""gear"".  When it comes to CLT, I seem to have gotten little of the first, less of the second, and I'll be damned if I could find more than a handful of electrical outlets in the C concourse.

The airport staff came across as a bit cold and begrudgingly willing to help when I was bumped from one flight and had to get transfered to a different flight.  The food selection was minimal (unless I hoofed it to the other end of the airport), and what food there was in the C concourse was edible, but not wonderful . . . and the beer was good, but can someone clue me in to why a local microbrew was $8?  And in todays day and age, why were they playing hide-and-seek with electrical outlets -- I think that frustrated me the most.

On the upside, the nice thing was the big panoramic window at the far end of the concourse -- at the far end of the runway -- where you could relax in the rocking chair and watch the airplanes lining up and landing.

In the end, it's not a bad airport, but is certainly one which could use some updates to accommodate the traveller of the 21st century -- it's definitely not as modern as JFK (particularly T5), but neither is it PHL.",0,1,0

Charlotte also has Pet Therapy dog that will greet you and give you dog kisses.  My Therapy dog greeted me with a nice hand shake and hug. Sure gets rid off all that stress in traveling. They also have a line up of rocking chairs in the middle of the atrium.  It was quite nice especially facing towards the view where planes were taking off.

1. Why do some of the US Airways terminals smell like pee?
2. Why do I feel like a drunk one legged baby with Alzheimer's could move people thru security faster than their current staff?

For the most part the airport is easy to navigate, has plenty of food options, free wifi, and even some rocking chairs for you to sit back with a glass o' sweet tea and watch the planes go by. I also thought the fountain greeting you outside when you exit the airport was quite lovely.

But charm checks itself at the door when you're standing in line at the slowest moving security entrance ever and scurrying by urine smelling gates. 

I read there are attendants in the ladies' room - all I got was a janitor making sure I flushed my pee. Um, was I supposed to pee on the carpet outside B6?",8,18,6

I ended up staying up all night with 3 fellow passenger gals and doing sunrise tai chi, but I assume this is not a typical experience.

Since then I have had several more representative encounters with CLT and I must say that the word that characterizes it best is ""convenient"". If you are the passenger yourself, they have clearly marked shuttles that go directly to all the parking decks. There are alway plenty of security screeners on duty & personnel are quick to point out which checkpoints have short or nonexistent lines. Once you are through security they have the two things that are absolutely essential to & unfortunately missing from some major airports (I'm looking @ you, BWI!): a Starbucks & free Wi-Fi. Throw in those Cracker Barrel-esque rockers and, oh yeah, generally prompt flights on a variety of airlines and you have yourself the makings of fairly pleasant travel.

Maybe you are picking up some other weary traveler. In that case, the loop around the terminal is short & when the pick-up area gets busy there are often employees directing traffic to keep the flow moving. 

True, you aren't going to find a plethora of red eye flights out of CLT, but if you are willing to travel during the hours that humans are supposed to be functioning during, Charlotte-Douglas offers an above par airport experience.",2,0,0

Security line was unnessarily slow. Just two agents..one checking tickets and the other checking the bags. After about a half hour of that slowness, they finally opened up another line. 

If you have a connecting flight on a small airline in the ""E"" terminal, you'll be walking a lot. They do have walkways, but one of them wasn't working. The walkways are narrow, so it's easy to get stuck behind two goobers standing side by side on the walkway. Some of the hallways are also very narrow.

Bathroom: They actually have a bathroom attendant in the men's bathroom. Never seen that before at an airport.  Unfortunately, there are NO toilet seat covers in the stalls and the toilet paper roulette wheel is ridiculously hard to use. 

On the way home, I had a connection back in Charlotte. We landed right on time, but had to wait almost a half hour for a gate. Wait, there's more. Once we finally got to the gate, they didn't have enough baggage handlers to unload  the gate-checked luggage...another 20 minute wait. WEAK SAUCE and LAME-O, CLT!

The main food court looks new and is really nice.

Seems to me food is more important than convenience and efficiency at this airport.

Everything you didn't know you needed in an airport. They keep it clean and tidy and the bathrooms are decent. I don't know much about TSA since this is my connection airport, so I'll let other Yelpers chat about that.

However, when purchasing tickets and finding out your layover is in Charlotte, don't try to save time by getting the flight with the smallest layover. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. As another Yelper mentioned, there are no shortcuts. I mean, if you manage to snag a ride on the multiple carts going by, good on you, but you know good and well that your legs are working and you need to walk.

Got an hour to kill before we head to Turks & Caicos, and this awesome airport offers unlimited free wi-fi in 45 min. increments....so why not...I'll write a review, cuz well, that's what a true Yelpie fan would do, right? 

This airport reminds me of my beloved favorite, beautiful hometown airport, San Diego.  You can tell it's been redone. Everything's super clean and new! There's even a sign as you drive in that says ""Fit for the Queen""...how did they know I was coming??? Lol

Where we are waiting (American Airlines, Terminal D) they have not one, but 2 free charging stations! And what I love about this is that one is the traditional, sit at the counter charging station. But the one I'm at is behind the cushioned seats, so I can charge and sit relaxed at the same time. So now, I can write my review and not drain my battery. Yay for me! And you...cuz you can read my review haha!

Came in last nite, on a Tuesday nite around 6:45pm for an overnite layover. It was busier than I would've expected for a weeknight, but manageable.  Nothing like LAX.  I love how their baggage area actually has a screen with all the arriving flights showing which actual carousel your bags are at...so no walking up and down figuring out where they are. It was pretty crowded for a Tuesday nite.

This morning, Wednesday, arrived around 9:15am and pleasantly surprised no lines for anything. Now, we are flying first class, so that automatically bypasses lines, but even the regular lines were non-existent. 

TIP: Pre-TSA check trumps first class. Our super cool TSA guy gave me a friendly ""Hello, Kitty"" greeting as he saw me wearing my HK shirt, and holding my kitty kat backpack...and instead of checking us thru the first class line, he kindly took the time to walk me and the hubs to Pre-TSA so we could keep our shoes on and leave all our liquids inside our bags! You don't get that kind of service from airport workers. I was gonna take his pic but I'm sure the airport police would've yelled at me lol. Anywhoooo, 5 stars for a quick & breezy pass thru security. I told him ""I'm gonna make you famous on Yelp!"" Hahaha. He really started off our entrance to the airport on a great note. I just love super friendly, happy people!

There are plenty of dining options, restrooms, and they have the moving walkway thingie if you so incline.  Overall, one of the nicest airports I have been to. And I hate airports. San Diego airport has got some serious, strong competition. This may even edge them out (due to the free wi-fi).

Oh and their bathrooms have attendants directing you which side of the bathroom to go in to keep the line flowing.  Automated flushers, faucets and paper towels! I hate the hand dryers which just blow germs around. 

Overall, a great experience and the next time we do our Caribbean travels, I would look to flying thru CLT as a layover (overnite or not).",8,7,9

Absolutely anywhere. However, when walking around the CLT airport, any place you need to be is easily a 20 minute walk - if not longer.

The layout of CLT is terrible. The ""spokes off a hub"" concourse design may have worked  a couple decades ago, but the space has just become over crowded. It also doesn't help when people who have no concept of the world around them will stop walking right in front of you. Then, in an attempt to get around them you're side-swiped by an electric cart for the 27th time. 

The concourses themselves were a bit outdated, crowded, and felt like it had minimal air conditioning. Food selection all around was fried stuff or really good smelling BBQ, but had a good breakfast at the Nascar restaurant.

The one thing going for this place is the hospitality and friendliness of the employees - for the airport, TSA, airlines, and even restaurants. If you as much as give them a smile and a ""thanks much"" they're beyond willing to go the extra mile for you. This was great since we had maintenance issues with our Delta flight.

Shame on United check in employees.

As far as the airport, they are currently doing a lot of construction to both the interior and exterior, so navigating around that can be a chore.  During rainy days, there is no cover between the airport and the rental car\/parking garage area, so you will get wet.

As far as dining and other service options, check out one of the many terminal directories located throughout the airport.  I found the one across from the main food court near Terminal C.  Terminal C happens to have the most food options, followed by E due to its sheer size.  If you're going through A, you have the least and worst options.

This is where my headache began.  The process came to a dead stop when there was someone being brought to the front of the line.  The scanning area became deadlocked and the way the stuff comes out of the x-ray machine forces people to walk into a little area and have to walk back the same way, which causes issues.
There would not have been enough seats at the terminals if we needed to sit.  Got there as the plane began boarding.  I didn't spend a lot if time there.  Seems like a lot of good options.  Not a bad place.  An average airport.",1,1,2

You have to catch a shuttle they will not let you walk and you wouldn't want to anyway. Make sure you pay attention to what lot you are parked in and what shuttle you need to get back.

First off all the gates are pretty close to each other and to add to the ease of use, their are moving platofmrs throughout the major travel pathways.  Beyond that, the seating areas are filled with locations to charge my ever growing collection of electronic components.

Next for me is the food situation.  This place is stellar.  If you look at my other reviews the Jamba Juice, Wine Bar and Burger Bar are all major standouts.  That being said their is a pretty decent mexican concept in the form of Salsarita's as well as decent BBQ.  

Beyond that their is ample massage, clothes and services to execute everything you need.

For parking, you can use the long term lots and take a shuttle in ($4 per day) or you can park in the lots\/towers closer to the airport for $6 per day, and that also requires a 3 minute shuttle ride. You can also park across from the airport in the lot there for $16\/day (I think) and walk across the street to the airport. On your return home, you'll find the shuttles outside of baggage claim in the middle island.  Look for the white shuttle buses and find the shuttle marked ""Long Term A"", ""Long Term B"" or ""Daily"" to take you back to your vehicle.

Inside the airport, ticketing is on the top level.  If the airport is crowded, go to the ends to go through security. Checkpoint A is usually a bit less crowded, and checkpoint D\/E is usually never crowded. This will save you a few minutes of standing in line.

After security, you'll find the middle of the airport has the food court, ATM's, a few shops and the infamous rocking chairs. If you need to power up and have some time, there's outlets near the rocking chairs. For food, I'd recommend the Carolina BBQ- its not the best in the area but is a better option than the other fast food joints. Enjoy your fried pickle!

If you need a coffee, there's Starbucks on both sides of the central area of the airport and there's one in the Gate C area.

The US Airways lounge is between the Gate C and Gate D\/E concourses and you can enter\/leave on either side.

If you need someone to pick you up, have them wait in the Cell Lot. Once you alert them its only 2 minutes or so until you'll see them outside of Baggage Claim.

As far as airports go, Charlotte Douglas is probably one of the nicer ones you'll visit. If you have some time to kill, roam around a bit and enjoy the shops or just relax in a rocking chair and watch the world go by.",3,0,0

In the next 5 years, CLT is planning to expand the roadway outside the airport, add an extension to the E terminal, add another security checkpoint, build 2 new parking decks, and make various improvements to the airport including many new restaurants. 

Flying through CLT is extremely easy. The airport is layout is like a hand--1 terminal with 5 ""wings"" if you will. Concourse A belongs to Delta, airTran, American, United, and Air Canada Jazz. Concourses B and C belong to US Airways domestic travel. Concourse D is home to US Airways international travel, some US Airways domestic travel, jetBlue, and the daily Lufthansa flight to Munich. Concourse E is home to US Airways Express. D and E are the newest concourses, and are very nice. Concourse D was just redone, adding a lounge area complete with sushi and Pinkberry, which is delicious. 

Security wait times are usually manageable, and with the new addition coming in June of a 5th security checkpoints, security should be a breeze. I have found staff to be pretty friendly all around. Delays are usually not bad at CLT, and runway congestion is nearly absent with the addition of a 4th runway at Charlotte. Charlotte offers a wide variety of destinations, including European cities such as Frankfurt, Munich, and Rome. Overall, an airport that's rapidly improving. Another nice touch is that WiFi is free.

Back in the mid '70's, a bond referrendum was help to build a new terminal. Old terminal was a WWII relic and you had to walk out onto the tarmac to board the planes. Not jetways. Eastern was the dominate carrier and the dominate type of planes were still piston.

Charlotte was growing and needed a new terminal but the bond got voted down by a wide margin. Leaders of the Bond Campaign had done a poor job in communicate the need for the project and a bad job negotiating the deal with the airlines.

The Chamber of Commerce along with the Governing Boards and Commissions and took stock and started plans for a new bond campaign. First thing is the formed a Blue Ribbon Committee of 100 to lead the campaign. These people came from all segments of the community. A Central Steering Committee to Run the Campaign was put together. I had the pleasure of serving on both.  Negotiations were undertaken with the airlines to guarantee the bonds to limit exposure.

The rest is history. The Bonds passed and for the most part were paid off with landing and gate fees. The airline continued to grow and expand and still is to this day when they are in the middle of another billion dollar expansion.

It has proved to be the spark plug that has propelled Charlotte grown over the past 40 years.

Today you have a beautiful terminal with 5 concourses. Beautiful glass and steel architecture that is constantly evolving. Best known for the rocking chairs in various parts of the terminal.

Good selection of restaurants and shops for those with time to kill between flights. Good shuttles to a number of local hotels.

Those who have it best are those who are connecting through Charlotte. For those of us who have flights originating or terminating in Charlotte, you have to put up with traffic. They have added more parking and are adding more which helps and they are in the process to upgrading the lanes for those being dropped off or picked up.  Uber and Lift have helped somewhat but the airport is an organic body growing and adapting to it's grown so it's a work in progress.

CLT was definitely designed as a domestic airport, not a major hub of a legacy airline as one of US's international gateway. Literally everywhere but the central nexus is extremely crowded with people, and the situation is worsened by the poor design of the boarding gate, which a huge line of people awaiting to board their flights spill into the hallways. The distance that may take a few minute normally will take significantly more in this airport.

Also, good luck finding a seat!

To add fuel to the fire, the food here is also expensive even by airport standards: more than $10 for the cheapest entrees anywhere.

Bottom line is that avoid transferring in this airport. If you must, don't tempt fate and give yourself more than an hour.

Only drawback I see is that if you are in a rush there is a heck of a lot of walking from one concourse to another and if you go through the wrong security line good luck making you flight with all the walking.

There are quite a few food options on each terminal, although most of them are low-end quick stop types of places. There's a central sitting area with rocking chairs, along with a little food court where you can sit down in Terminal B, which is nice. There is little general seating, though, so LOTS of people are sitting on the floor all along the terminal. I, for instance, just took a conference call from the floor next to an outlet.

I've always admired the airport goodwill ambassadors, or courtesy hosts.  I remember seeing the guys and gals in Denver with the cowboy hats and western glow in their faces... and tags that read ""volunteers"".  Volunteers!  Gotta love folks like that.  They just stone-cold love their city that much, and want to share their enthusiasm.  Sometimes I look at them, and their eager faces, as they scan for someone who might want to know why the Rockies are wonderful or why Colorado is a great place to send your kid to study minerology, and I see them identify a potential convert but then watch them walk by, and I think how sad it is when someone full of love wants to share it and is not granted the chance.  [I know, it's kind of a bit much that I read the sometimes-sadness of the human condition in the gazes of a Stetson-bedecked airport welcoming committee.  But still.  You get me.]

Back to Dottie...  

I approached her.  She identified me as an in-bound inquiry on the verge of happening.  So she launched into Phase One of her professional routine... 

She smiled at me.

Ok, wait, that previous sentence didn't do the trick.  I wrote it wrong.  What I'm trying to say is that she SMILED at me.  High wattage.  Mega dosage.  Not too much, but also not nearly too little.  Splendid.  Brightness.  Warmth.  Like a force of nature.  But a force of nature that cared for you (like a breeze in the tropics), not a tsunami.

Man, it was one helluva smile.  You want to talk about feeling welcome someplace?  I didn't just feel welcome in Charlotte.  I felt welcome on Planet Earth.  

People talk about aptitude for certain kinds of work.  Whoever thought up the idea (perhaps it was her) to have Dottie deploy her radiant smile as a greeter or goodwill ambassador was just simply very skilled at career suitability identification.

Having encountered something so special, I felt funny asking something so mundane: where to get a cuppa joe.  But she rocked it.  And I walked away.

And I thought... Christian, you can't just walk away from a gift like that.  You gotta acknowledge it.  So I went back and I did.  And I learned something interesting...

""Dottie, I'm Christian.""
""Nice to meet you.""
""I just want to tell you that your smile is really something wonderful and I'm glad I encountered it and its owner.""
If you can believe it, the smile intensified.  
""You have no idea how much I needed to hear that today.  Thank you.""

And as I walked away, I marveled at what she'd just said.  Here she was, a professional and sincere dispenser of human warmth, who needed some herself.  I guess guardian angels sometimes need guarding, too.",3,4,2

Charlotte-Douglas is ok in that it is an international airport and large enough to pretty much fly anywhere.  It helps that it is a US Air hub, but it also hurts that it's a hub since it seems like it's pretty expensive to fly in and our of Charlotte.

I've always praised their long term parking since it seems well done, and I use it a lot when I travel for business.  However the last time I planned on leaving my car in long term, all the lots were closed and I had to park in the daily lot (which isn't too much longer), but the stress of driving around trying to find a spot was a bit much on top of trying to give enough time for checking in and security.

They do have the new body scanners installed (within the last year I think) but now all the controversy has sprung up about the technology.

I will say in the ten years that we have lived and flown out of and into Charlotte Douglas, it has definitely improved. The new, huge parking deck has been completed. We choose long term because it's only $5 a day and there are tons of shuttles that are active. There is a new traffic flow, which at first is confusing, but handles the cars and buses much better. Over the last few years they've added a new runway and plan on another one soon. My hope is that Charlotte understands growth and is able continue to improve their services as it happens. I don't know if that is possible, but in my opinion, they have done a good job this far. One huge improvement I hope to see is better management of the drop off and pick up area.

I asked an employee where I should go to wait for someone to land and they helped me look up there flight and we found out it was delayed. So the gentleman guided me to a parking lot and then talked to the lady driving and told her where I was going. Top notch service. 

The parking was only a $1 per hour. I'm not use to paying for parking where I am from but I remember paying around $15 in Chicago so this was a bargain!

Without a doubt, Charlotte Douglas International is the best airport in the Carolinas.  It's the biggest airport in North and South Carolina, so it offers the most options when it comes to flights.  This typically means lower airfare, more scheduling flexibility, and a larger number of non-stop flights.  CLT to SFO, FTW.

Growing up in High Point, our family's ""home"" airport was naturally Greensboro's Piedmont Triad International Airport (PTI).  It's a fine airport if you're making a short regional\/east coast trip.  However, more often than not, you will have to connect somewhere if your itinerary originates or ends at PTI.  That can be an inconvenience.

More often these days, if flying into or out of North Carolina and trying to get to the Triad, we'll bypass PTI altogether and instead use CLT (and in some instances, RDU - Raleigh\/Durham International Airport).  The less-than-1.5-hour drive from the Triad to CLT is worth the time savings and hassle of having to connect in Chicago, DC, Dallas, Houston, etc.

Currently, the Charlotte airport is in the midst of major expansion\/renovation.  Passenger traffic is growing and the airport is trying to keep up.  While the airport is a hub for US Airways, it still feels relatively small.  No need for people movers.  You can walk in a straight line and cover all the terminals in a short amount of time.  This is good and bad - no need to navigate\/walk long distances, but when it's packed, it's packed (not a whole lot of space).  There are multiple security checkpoints and you can easily go from one to another to find shorter lines.

The airport has many years on it, but it's well maintained and feels comparatively modern and clean.  One of the best things about Charlotte's airport are the inexpensive parking fees.  Unfortunately, parking fees will be increasing soon, but will remain at reasonable levels.  Long-term lots will increase to $7 a day from $5 a day and daily parking will increase to $10 a day from $7 a day.  The hourly deck and valet prices are set to increase too.  All parking at CLT requires shuttle access to the terminals.

Overall, Charlotte Douglas is a solid airport for the Carolinas.",4,1,3

Going through security was probably the easiest I have ever done.  Although I had completely forgotten about the water bottle I had in my duty free bag.  You'll have to forgive me for buying that about ten hours ago in a different country and during a time where I was half asleep.  All that was left in it was a quarter of the bottle.  Completely my fault, and a quick scan of the bag (and disposal of the water) and I was on my way.

Gate attendants are really aggressive about the 2 carry-on policy. This annoys me to no end, especially on BIG planes that only have 20-40 people on them. My purse isn't large, neither is my backpack. I keep my meds, phone, and tickets in my purse, I carry my snacks, a sweater, and toiletries in my pack. The purse fits in the pack. I have a 3rd small carry on, which is my expensive work equipment. I am willing to plane side check it because most of the planes I'm on are too small for even a ""regulation"" carry on. Soooo...I tend to assume I'll be checking plane-side...which is why the purse generally isn't in the pack. This is the only airport I've been at where the gate staff THREE TIMES made me stuff my purse into my pack before boarding. 

Other than that huge annoyance, the signage is decent, the food options are ok. It's just not a very pretty airport. They do have a lot of rocking chairs though.",4,4,3

One particular area in Section C smells absolutely rancid. I had a layover at this airport to and from Punta Cana. CLT is one of American Airlines hub and it's extremely crowded. If you are in a rush to catch your next flight you will most likely run into someone since the hallways are narrow and people walk extremely slow. My most recent experience flying back from Punta Cana was the most frantic experience I have had at the airport. My flight landed 20 minutes early at CLT but since we were an international flight we had to wait for a gate to open up at Terminal D. We ended up waiting on the tarmac for literally 1 hour 10 minutes (waiting for the other flight to taxi out and we got stuck in traffic with the other planes). 

So by the time I am inside the terminal, I had half an hour to get through customs, TSA and to my gate. The customs line was extremely long and they only had 3 workers so it took forever. Long story short- by the time I made it through customs, TSA and sped walk to my gate I made my flight. Unfortunately numerous people on my previous flight did not end up making it so there were a bunch of vacant spots on the plane. No thanks CLT. Never again.",5,2,1

You see, it's easy to get turned around in the Charlotte airport. Somehow, we managed to visit every single terminal by the time we left. Sometimes multiple times.

Our main visits were to:
-Terminal F...or maybe E? One of those. That's where we got off our first flight.
-Terminal B: Our connecting flight was supposed to leave out of this terminal, but then it wasn't there. I then noticed the flight being listed off as located in Terminal C, so we booked it there, but it had already left.
-Terminal C: Super nice American Airlines attendant re-booked me in 4D for the next flight out -- an aisle with a bunch of legroom! And no one next to me! I was so pleased. Best flight ever. Best. flight. ever.
-Carolina Beer Company: Mediocre and felt like an Applebees. Pass.
-A Taste of Carolina: Not mediocre and didn't feel like an Applebees. Go.
-BOJANGLES: See my specific review. All the love to this fast food chain.
-Bathrooms: They were...okay. Small but generally clean. Much better than *some* airport bathrooms. (Lookin' at you, NOLA, and your super weird attached seat covers.)

I also bought a Coke for just about $3, which I guess is normal in an airport. Unfortunately, I left basically the whole bottle in the plane's seat pocket. Downfall of having too much space, I suppose.

Does it fit all the man-ssentials on chic guy needs?""  Despite convo, they are pretty quick and getting past security doesn't take forever. 

Might have to buy a plane ticket to simply enjoy the food that they have here.  Big daddy's burger is really good.  Hisso sushi hits the spot. And the food court has many options, with someone on the piano tickling the ivories.  Then, head over to the rocking chairs and relax.  You won't want to leave - and some folk look like they've been there a minute!

But you gotta love the parking.  $5\/day long-term parking is brain-dead great option.  Also if you forget where you park, and it's really late at night, and you keep her good spirits, she'll drive you around to each lot really slowly and help you find your car!

It doesn't come close to having the number of travelers and planes of say La Guardia or Miami, and it certainly doesn't have the weather issues of Chicago or Denver. So why is that I have never flown smoothly through this airport. I have never had a flight that wasn't delayed, cancelled, or required an all-out sprint across the airport. 
Coming from our honeymoon, we sat at the gate for over 2 hours. Just on the plane with no air, waiting. Apparently customs was clogged. I don't think anybody disagree that they would stand in an insanely long line with a little personal space and air flow, than sit on a cramped plane where you were on top of strangers and no air flow. Of course, we missed our connecting flight. We watched the group in front of us that was to take off earlier than ours have their flight held. When we asked about ours being held they just said no. We only held theirs because they were a party of 5. Nice.
A month of so ago, our flight going to a work conference was delayed. We missed the entire first day of the conference. The flight back was delayed also, not to mention they changed terminals and gates 3 times in half an hour. Nothing says good customer service like a 5k before you get on your plane.

Due to some recent renovations CLT has had a bit of a face lift on the arrivals floor. For starters they got rid of the carpet and replaced it with the more logical tile covering.

The main atrium is beautiful and contains quite a few different food and shopping options - even if I do always follow my nose to Cinnabon. The wall of windows lets light in and the trees are a pleasant addition that I don't recall having seen in any other airports to date. Lastly, why is everybody hating on the white rocking chairs?

If you A and B are slammed busy, walk down about 50 yards to C or D and the lines are almost always shorter and typically faster. Most people congregate to A and B since they are closer to the beginning of curbside drop-off. Fear not! On those buys travel days, seek out the slimmer lines of the other TSA's at C and D.

First, if you're flying out of the E gates, stop reading this review and start walking now. Seriously.. even if you aren't flying out for 2 weeks, you better start walking now because it takes FOREVER to get there, especially if you're walking there from the A concourse. Your best bet is to start limping and find one of the hospitality golf carts (you can't miss them.. just listen for the annoying beeping sound) and look pitiful enough until they pick you up. Do this and you just might make your flight afterall.

The airport has a really nice central area with a food court, shops and a sit down Chili's. I typically head over to the BBQ place in the food court and grab a beef brisket sandwich, fried okra and a fried pickle spear, but if I have enough time, the Chili's isn't bad.

Pros:
*Lots of shops & restaurants - if you get stuck here, you won't be bored or hungry
*Restrooms were pretty clean
*Rocking chairs + piano music in the center

Cons:
*Spoke design is inefficient and requires LOTS of walking when going fom concourse to concourse
*At least half the moving sidewalks were out of order. That really, really sucked for my travel partner who recently had ACL surgery

Speaking of the moving sidewalks, do people understand that they aren't a ride?!? They're for getting you to your destination faster - so perhaps it isn't the best idea to stand in the center of it, eating an ice cream cone and vacantly staring. MOVE ALONG PEOPLE!!!",5,4,3

The genius who built this airport thought it is a great idea to put in thick sticky carpet everywhere which makes it so much harder to roll your suitcase over.  I already have carpel tunnel from traveling every week.  I don't need extra strain on my wrists.  

The employees here are generally very unprofessional, lack sense of urgency and priority, and just awful.  One of the employees who pushed my wheelchair when I was traveling with injury looked annoyed the whole time and asked for tip.  Since he stood in front of me asking for tip, I gave him $20 to make him go away.  He acted like the type who will ask for more and more money if I gave him any less.  Later, another employee told me he is not allowed to ask for tips.  They even had people soliciting for tips at bathrooms while selling vanity items.  Am I at a nightclub or an airport?  I have never seen people with this kind of demeanor working at other airports.  

Even when there is no flight delay, the flights always leave late since the United gate agents (the same ones every week too) take their time chit chatting instead of working on getting the planes boarded and out of the gate in an efficient manner.

Not that I'm some great world traveler, but all the more reason.  See, when I booked my virgin transatlantic flight (yes, virgin with a lower case v--as in, I was popping my passport cherry; not capital V, as in going on the airline), I needed an airport that wouldn't drive me batty with traffic.  As fun as it would have been to fly through a big name airport like JFK or LaGuardia, I think I might have regretted it.  In fact, on the return leg, I was even more grateful.  

Being a noob, I took to the interweb for advice.  I had read in some online travel blog about how I should book 3 hours between connecting flights for the first stop back on US soil to get through customs, get to the new plane, blah, blah, blah.  I read that Charlotte was well organized. My flight only gave me two hours and change BUT there was a later one on the same airline to the same destination if I should happen to miss my connection.  So I felt okay about it. 

When we touched down on US soil, the flight attendants made an announcement that a Lufthansa flight had also just touched down and that their plane was MUCH larger than ours and that we should head the heck out ASAP if we have connections to get. Panicked, we all made a run for it to customs but were too late.  Stupid Lufthansa people.  As we stood sulking in line, we realized how quickly the line was moving.  Customs agents throughout the room made sure that travelers were in the correct customs lines (""US and Canadian passengers ONLY on the LEFT--EVERYONE ELSE ON THE RIGHT"").  They came through the line to make sure everyone in line had their documents and KEPT THEM OUT instead of tucking them in some side pocket of some suitcase somewhere only to waste time fumbling for it later. Finally, they segregated people into mini-lines for customs agents to be screened.  All told, we stood in line (behind Lufthansa even!) for just 15 minutes. Take that JFK.  

I might even add that unlike most airport staff, the folks here even seemed to be a bit friendlier.  Customs agents smiled and played with babies.  Volunteers standing in corridors handed us free luggage tags.  Airports of the world could take a lesson from Charlotte-Douglas, I think...",3,0,1

CLT is one of those airports that is clean and straight forward but it really helps to know a few tips and tricks so you don't pull out your hair when you're waiting in line behind 26 teenagers who refuse to take their game systems out of the bag for security screening. 

Parking here is pretty affordable, I'm fairly certain that Daily Parking is still only $6 per day, and long term is $4 per day (thanks Bill F.!). Coming from a Chicago native, that is ridiculously affordable. Once you head in, evaluate your security options. If you're a seasoned traveler, I recommend checkpoint A. It moves the fastest and its typically flooded with well-traveled business peeps. Oh, and really you can go through any security checkpoint and easily access your gate. That is, unless you're flying out of Gate E...prepare for a trek. 

To Faith D.'s point - use the moving sidewalks, but do offer the courtesy of moving to the side and letting walkers pass. If you've got some spare time, there are some cute little shops and restaurants around the 'port and tons of conveniently located ATMs. They also have a delicious little gelato place. 

So, yes, I can honestly say that I kinda like this airport. Yay for the QC!",7,3,5

In my opinion, this airport is one of the worst for layovers if you don't have 1hr+ unless you are lucky and your flights are in the same terminal. If your flight gets delayed and you have 30 minutes or less to get to another terminal, either RUN or forget it. Even if you run and make it, your bags most likely won't (I know, this happened to me before a cruise!!!)  There are no trains so be ready for a lot of walking if your flights are spread out. On the plus side, there are a lot of shops and restaurants along your walk, even a few cute areas with rocking chairs to catch a breath. The bathrooms are kept very clean by the bathroom attendants stationed in each one (don't expect privacy!) Also, this airport can be very crowded. If you choose to sit where you can see your gate but not at it, make sure you pay attention because it can be hard to hear announcements and it is easy to miss your flight, especially at the very end of some terminals where multiple flights leave out of the same area (I've missed my flight this way!) To charge a phone, my secret is to find a chair against the wall, there are outlets so you won't have to fight for a spot at a charging station.

If you are using this airport to fly from or into, it is usually pretty good. I have never had an issue in baggage claim, or with long lines at security since there are several and they are stationed right near departure gates. Just REMEMBER WHERE YOU PARKED. There are multiple lots so remember your area AND lot number. I was once lost in the wrong lot for an hour trying to find my car!

I thought I may have been imaging how busy the airport is just due to being impatient, but it is one of the busiest in the US.  After Chiquita decided to moved their HQ to Charlotte because of more flights, I looked it up.  Charlotte is the 7th busiest airport in the US for scheduled flights and 17th busiest US airport based on passenger traffic.  It is definitely not a sleepy southern airport and it can get hectic.  I arrived for a 7am weekend flight, had to park a good distance away and take a shuttle in to the terminal.  The long term perking was cheap at $4 a day.  

Upon being dropped off in front of the terminal, I checked my bag with the skycap which was quick and painless.  I did what I always did which is walk to the least busy checkpoint.  The Charlotte airport is still not very big, so all gates and concourses can be accessed easily from any checkpoint.  The main checkpoint had a very long line as usual.  Charlotte has the body scanners so you will need to remove EVERYTHING from your pockets, including your wallet and any paper.The concourses were also busy, and the gates were crowded with passengers - mostly transplants going to Buffalo, Philly,NYC but a few going to places like Florida.   

There are some nice food options here, but the only thing I have ever bought here is Jamba Juice.  I used to think it was better than Smoothie King and wanted other accessible locations in Charlotte, but the smoothie I got this time wasn't very good so I am happy with Smoothie King.

After I landed in Buffalo, the airport there was surprisingly calm, and was also calm when I left.  Charlotte's airport is reflective of what the city is today - no longer a slow southern city but rather a fast paced city with people in a hurry to get everywhere.  The city of Buffalo itself had a much slower pace than Charlotte with a lot less traffic.  It took no longer than 20 minutes to get anywhere - even to the outer burbs.  When returning, there were at least a dozen TSA agents at BUF doing nothing, so each person was  able to get into their own line.

That is not the only construction.  There is an addition being built for A terminal. That's the good side. The bad side is parking and the trying to pickup. Every week it's a new traffic patterns. Not unusual to have no parking spaces. Once you get a spot the bus ride is short to the gate. Now more walking and trying to manage suitcases up escalators to the ticket counter. Also and very sad is there are no shops before security other than a Starbucks.  So say your goodbuys before the ticket counter. After you get your ticket, it's off to security. Precheck line seems longer these days than regular And slower too.  The construction is the worst problem followed closely by TSA bottle neck. After the Precheck slowdown the rest of the terminal visit is not bad. There are lots of food and shops. The famous white rocking chair if you have time for a sit. Some gates are getting charging stations, but more are needed. If you are flying on holiday or international plan 3 hours. A normal visit takes about two hours. Experienced flyers try to leave early to avoid afternoon summer storms. If you do get stuck there is Uber and a lot of hotels near by. But no hotel connected to the airport.

Navigating or accessing gate: airport layoff is has one main central access that divides into multiple terminals after security. In other words, no need to catch a tram, treadmill or bus to move from one terminal to another. Those who need an electronic cart should not expect a lengthy ride. Nice size airport that is compact. 

Stopover or Delay: will not go hungry, lots of ports to charge up, lots of food choices to pizza, Southern comfort, burgers, seafood, sandwiches, etc. My favorite is the sushi bar in main terminal.

Warm: open layout and  white Cracker Barrel rocking chairs in the main terminal invites a warm feel. Yes, rocking chairs. I've watched folk fight over these prime seating chairs just to sit, people watch or grab a nap. Or maybe just check email before a flight.

Easy to navigate terminals. Terminal E is a hike though.
Plentiful eateries, all of which are overpriced of course. 
The public areas are generally clean, even the restrooms. 
Spacious terminals and concourses.

Parking is a joke. I always use long-term parking and take the shuttle, and that mitigates the hassle of trying to park close to the terminal.
 
Prices for flights out of Charlotte are also ridiculous. 
I only fly out of CLT if there is no other direct flight option available.

All of my business associates over the past twenty years routinely drive to either GSO or Raleigh, because flights are just SO much less expensive, parking is easier, and check ins and luggage claims are less of a problem.

Leaving on schedule.....just resign yourself to the fact that it isn't going to happen. And the same thing holds true for making your connecting flight through Charlotte. Avoid this place if it is possible, if you have to make a connection to ATL or similar large airports. 
 
A lot of Charlotte Douglas' negative reviews are due to US Airways poor service. Charlotte is one of US Airways major hubs and they should shine here, but that rarely happens. US Airways is just a mere shadow of what Piedmont Airlines used to be, and they were exceptional.

Once we landed, I thought I had a good hour, but because of the ""traffic"" I was on that flight for an additional 30 mins waiting for the next open gate.

On top of that, when I was finally able to get out, I had to run onto the other side of the airport to catch my flight.  I honestly cannot believe that I made it with 12 minutes to spare.  I sacrificed using the restroom to make sure that I wouldn't miss my flight.  We then boarded and was ready to fly out....40 mins LATER...

I can't say that I had one of the best experiences here at this airport (things happen, I understand that)...but the main reason why I'm giving this a 3 star was because I was half way running to my next flight when I realized I lost my phone. *Oh no!!!*, so I had to run back to the previous gate and I asked the assistant at the front.  I informed her what had happened and she had someone go to the back and search my previous seat to see if my phone had fallen. THEY FOUND IT!!! I was so happy that they even let me give them hugs. haha.

My favorite aspects:
- Cheap parking, $6\/day for daily with a short bus ride, $4\/day for long term.  The bus drivers are the friendliest people in the airport too.  Always cheerful, even on holidays.
- Easy to get to.  It takes no time to get to CLT and traffic flow is phenomenal.  I used to live in Chicago and getting to O'Hare was often a nightmare and definitely an hour commitment.
- Relatively short security lines.  I think the ones on the ends are fastest - D & A I believe.
- Copious dining and shopping opportunities and rocking chairs add some entertainment.
- The Queen fountain outside is cool.
- Bathroom attendants (they are always so friendly, hand you paper towels, and have even offered me mouth wash).

Downsides:
- The typical airport headaches such as security and the rest of the ""herd"" (other travelers).
- U.S. Airways
- Due to U.S. Airways hubbing here, a lot of your fellow travellers are just passing through CLT and you often overhear phone conversations of people complaining about being stuck in the middle of nowhere.",1,0,1

First off, this is a busy airport.  I didn't realize it was such a hub!  But, the walkways are wide and so you can easily hurry if need-be, or lazily stroll if you have a lay-over.  Moving walkways are kind of fun, too.

There are oodles of restaurants of all types.  From fast food to sushi.  Of course, it is an airport, so you'll need to empty your wallet for a simple sandwich.  If you have time to kill and money to spend, plenty of places serve beer.

The airport is visually nice inside.  They have big, open window areas for natural light.  Real trees can be found, which is a nice touch.  Big, white wooden rocking chairs are everywhere, which is such a nice, Southern touch.

The restrooms are so clean, and have attendants at all times.  

The ends of the concourses where there are multiple gates can get very crowded near boarding.  Especially if more than one flight is boarding within a short time of one another.  It would make me nervous if I had a small child with me and all that crowdedness.

I'm a cliche mani receiver. I like the massage, the cuticle treatment and the hot towel same as everyone else. Anyway this salon is open until 10pm, so even you redeye jetsetters can get your digits done right before the flight. 

After your tips are dried, I recommend a snack and glass of wine at Beaudevin. It would be easy to stop at Chili's because Chili's is RIGHT THERE and comfortable and you know it by heart, but don't. Do yourself a favor and get a charcuterie platter and hummus. It's good food, and not just by airport standards. 

Then I recommend catching your flight, because as awesome as CLT is, home is (hopefully) the better place to be.

I'm sure leaving on a Monday or Fri would include a very long wait. Overall check in boarding and the general airport were great . I flew US Airways which is the major hub down there and didn't' have any issues.
I did like the bathroom attendant I was there pretty early and had a few Starbucks drinks so I made quite a lot of trips to the bathroom before my flight. She was super nice and friendly . 
My only issue is the baggage claim , my flight was only an hour but I had to wait about 35-45 mins for my bags ! Oh also can't forget about the parking situation , it appears they are doing construction but I would add in an extra hour after you land for baggage retrieval and waiting on a bus to get back to your car.

They make up for it by having a spacious central area.

That being said, it operates fairly efficiently, and I really don't mind connecting here.  I've never been to Charlotte itself so this review is on the connection aspect only.

Seating:  There is not a whole lot of seating near many of the gates.

Wifi:  Free!

Shopping:  There is some.  I've never checked it out, though.

Decor:  They have a bunch of cute white rocking chairs in the center of the airport near the food court.  There is also a piano.  One time I ran through and there was a whole band.  And once there was karaoke.  I'm not sure if that was organized, though...

Outlets:  I've never noticed any, but I'm sure there are some somewhere.  Not optimal.

Food\/Drink:  Pretty much anything you could ever want.  Junk food, fast food, sit down, coffee, dessert, booze.  Off hand I can think of TCBY, Jamba Juice, Bojangles, Starbucks, Seattle's best,  and hundreds of other places.  Good haul.  Definitely one of my favorite airports to eat in.

Cliental:  Most of the people connecting here seem to be on their way to the beach.  That being said, there are so many of the world' SLOWEST walkers.  So annoying when you're trying to make a connection in less than 10 minutes.  I could walk faster than the people standing on the moving walkways.  Giant pet peeve.  The airport needs to post signs or something.

Gates:  As this is a US Airways hub, don't assume your gates will be close.  The express terminals are located in the E terminal.  B and I believe C now are the large US Airways flights.  I have almost died of a heart attack running from the far end of B to E.  It's not a small feat.

Moving Walkways:  Many!  But too many slow and lazy people standing and blocking them.

Try not to laugh every time you realize this airport's code is CLT.  I think it's hysterical.  :)",5,6,6

Also, the food selection is ample and wide; coffee, beer, sorbet, pizza, Italian, hamburgers, you name it. I also saw a Farmer's market in gate E. No kidding!

There are also four long term lots with routine bus shuttles outside of baggage claim. My most preferred is long term 1 because it is the closest to the airport.

+  This place is big, plenty of services from a modern wine bar to coffeeshops and retail locations.  Even a sushi bar and piano player.
+  The layout is pretty simple, and they try to keep it pleasant, they even have rocking chairs.
+ Clean and spacious
+ Free WiFi that's actually pretty decent.

Cons:
- US Air hub... I get delayed every single time... occasionally I get cancelled.
- All of the nice things I just mentioned in the Pros go away the moment you walk into the wings.  Gotta love a dilapidated Sbarros or chicken chain. 
- This all goes to the h - e - double hockey sticks when you try to leave.  The bus and taxi area is a completely insane clusterexplative.  I can't even understand what is happening with this, or why I'm standing in the wrong spot every time I try to reach the parking lot or the hotel.  Signage would help.

But yes, this is a rather larger airport. All the International flights are in one terminal  - -D. Smaller regional flights are out of E. But since I'm typically coming in from or going to PHX, those domestic flights (for US Air) are in B or C. 

Let me tell you...if you land at the end of say B, and you have a connection to a regional in E -- you better book it! There are people movers... but it could be a long jaunt for some. 

I like the white rocking chairs in the middle area. Makes me feel a bit relaxed.... as I am running past them on the people mover. (I don't think I've ever tried them yet -- but they look cute!)

US Airways club -- well, there's one. A large one. However if you're traveling Internationally, it's not an Envoy lounge and therefore not as large as the lounge in Philly. But it's still a nice lounge with great views.

I was going to complain on one point about airport management, until I did some checking...

They decided last November to remove all ATM's except for Bank of America's ATM's.  How dumb.  Okay, I know - they got paid a lot of money!!  Well, why don't you check with McDonald's too?!  They would probably pay you a fortune if you made it the only FOOD available in the airport!!  But wouldn't THAT make a lot of people happy!!

What you've done is simply to inconvenience a lot of people. I won't pay fees to use other ATM's so I can no longer get cash at the airport.

I had mixed feelings about this airport because the negatives easily outweigh the positives. Here's my perspective from someone who's visited CRT for the first time:

Positives: 
-Clean throughout
-Charging stations at each gate
-Lots of food options (Liked the 1897 market)
-Concourses clearly marked with large signage
-Airport staff are courteous, friendly and helpful
-US customs lines were long but steadily moving
-Ditto for the TSA lines


Negatives:

-Crowded (even on a weekday!) 
-US customs kiosk not friendly to the height challenged. (I had to jump to take my photo and I looked ridiculous doing so.) 
-Navigation through customs, baggage claims and TSA can be confusing at times. After coming off the plane, I found a lot of people standing around lost trying to figure out where to go next. I found this to be a problem with noobs like myself, immigrants and the elderly. Had Ben not been there to help me get around, I would've been completely lost. Not knowing where to go held up the lines and caused major traffic jam. They have staff on hand to guide you through this part to help you get to your next destination but, clearly, there weren't enough. There are a variety of ways this could be improved through use of more signage, staff and perhaps a line to corral people into going the right direction. 
-No cellphones can be used in the customs area. Use your cellphone and it will get confiscated. Poo.
-No clocks in the customs area. I wanted to know what time it was but couldn't take out my cell phone. Double Poo.

Side note for international travelers: As soon as you get off the plane, just have your passport, customs form, baggage claim ticket and boarding pass in your hand. You can't believe how many people fail to do this and then hold the line up because their frantically digging through their pockets and purses to get them. Sigh. People!!! If your going to hold the line up, have the common courtesy to pull off to the side and obtain your items! DO NOT HOLD UP THE LINE!!! There are others trying to get to their plane in a short amount of time. Getting through an already crowded airport is nerve wracking enough.

Why do they have no tram?
Why do we have to traverse such a large area between our arrival and departing flights to begin with?  

At other airports, the gates are in close proximity.  Maybe this is common for some airports afterall, I have only flown into\/out of about a dozen different airports; but I am guessing that they could do alot better with this.

A tram would help.

That wasn't so fun, but  what was fun....I was able to grab a Cinnabon and coffee and sit in the rocking chairs underneath a big ass plane....YEAH I said that.  I sit in a white rocking chair (like i was at Cracker Barrel or my granny's house), eating my ginormous Cinnabon, drinking my coffee while sitting underneath a big ass plane hanging from the ceiling.  It was kind of surreal.  
Another time I passed through here, I stopped at California Pizza Kitchen grabbed a bite.  I wish I would have kept walking.  That place left alot to be desired.  
Everything else here was ho hum after traveling from Vegas.  The bathrooms here also seemed to be always broken or being cleaned.  I don't know what that is all about.

Maybe I'm biased because I came through LAX and PHL before coming through here, but it's the cleanest and best-maintained of the bunch.

Yes, the restrooms are staffed and there's a tip jar.  And reviewers are complaining about it????  Tips aren't mandatory, but after the disgusting restroom in PHL, I gladly fished in my purse and forked over 75 cents to the attendant who was keeping the place spotless.  And I do mean spotless.

Atriums and rocking chairs are both nice touches that make the airport feel hospitable even for a long layover.  Yes, the airport is a bit stretched out for the numbers of overall gates, but it allows for nice atriums, spaces to chill, and more restaurants and other amenities for travelers.  I also imagine it allows the airport more room to grow in the future.  I can see how commuter fliers (or those running late) might not appreciate the sprawl, though.

Free Wifi took 60 seconds to connect to.  Several outlets available for free charging in the atria.

Seating, carpet, fixtures all in good shape\/well-maintained.  Signage better than most airports (especially liked the map of restaurants\/shops\/amenities.)  And thumbs up for the trio of trash cans for recycling!

Seems to me like CLT took a few cues from Eurpoean airports.

Easy connection to light rail system (which I also liked) and very good wayfinding signage overall.

CLT, you almost had 5 stars:

Minus 1 star for Wifi not working in the main center shopping\/eating area AND for having all your shops and restaurants close at either 8 or 9 PM!!!!  For an airport of its size, I was shocked.  I wanted to grab Beachwood Farms (Carolina BBQ, fast-food-service-style), but they were closed and cleaning up at 8:30.  Even the bar was shut down!

As I was limping from Concourse E to B, a number of workers asked me if I would like them to hail down a shuttle car. Gee, I didn't think I was limping that badly :) A couple of shuttle cars also pulled up beside me and asked if I wanted a lift. WOW. I was impressed. I have traveled through some airports where the workers would glare at you if you even ""dare"" interrupt them to ask a question. 

I also like the fact that there are SO MANY rocking chairs throughout the airport and that they are close to electrical outlets.

The security check points are some of the fastest I've been to for TSA PreCheck as the Terminal B checkpoint is solely devoted to PreCheck -- a great setup to help get through faster! In addition, I find that checked bags, at least for priority passengers, come very quickly. 

I have fewer praises for the amenities. There is free WiFi if you watch and ad, which works well enough. However, the terminals could use an update -- the carpet is dingy and there are not enough charging stations.

After quite a trek, I finally found myself at baggage claim, and in good company with all the others who were also---totally confused. Ummm, where the hell are my bags and how the hell will I find them?  That's the sentence (add an F word here and there) I said aloud to self while pacing the 'ZONES.'   Come to find out, you have to check the magical  ""baggage boards""  first to help you with the search and rescue mission. 

So, once at the wall-O-baggage boards, I struggled to find my zone still. Why you say? Oh because Charlotte is an international hub which meant there were about 200 flights listed by departing city. And nope---not your departing city--but the departing city where you possibly connected. I mean, I can only assume that since OAK was no where on the board. So, when I located Phoenix---another huge hub---you have to then sort by airlines. Oy vey. But then the flights are listed by times...not in pacific time, or central time but eastern time. WTF. And even then...the times were no where near a time associated with any points in my day's travel. 

So here's what I did. Took a quick survey of where the majority of 'US Airways' flights were zoned and noticed most were Zone 2. So off I went in that direction AGAIN... Once there...Zone 2 was marked ""luggage for all cancelled departures only""   This was due to alllll the cancelled flights due to the East coast winter storm\/blizzards.

So, being a fish out of water, I wandered around like a asinine derelict till over in the corner I spied my doppelganger tagging my bags as abandoned.

The first time I was able to sneak onto the early flight in the adjacent gate, so I didn't spend much time here. The second time though, I had a 3 hour layover, so I was able to do some wandering.

Customs and Immigration was about average in terms of time and service. When I got through, I had to go through security again. This was the main weird part for me. There was a VERY high tech security scanning system that was not your typical metal detector. You have to stand and turn and then they scan you. JFK is my main airport, and nothing there even comes close to the CIA system in place here. And it's safe to say JFK has a much higher demand for an elaborate security system than CDT. 

My next complaint was that the result of this security system, the line moved verrrryyyyyy slowwwwly. It was not streamlined at all, and it took much longer than necessary because the employees were just really laid back and not in any rush. This didn't affect me because I'm a lunatic who leaves exorbitant amounts of time in between airline connections, but it IS a US Air hub and some people need to make their connections! Pick up the pace guys!

Oh dear, where to begin...Charlotte was our one stop between Boston and Pensacola, and my husband had previously suffered at Charlotte Airport so his expectations were low. On our way down to FL there were no issues to speak of, except to mention that one needs a good 20 minutes extra to get from one side of the building to the other. While there are miles of moving walkways, most often there are people standing in the walking lane or parents trying to get their little angel to pose for a picture while harried travelers are scrambling to catch their connecting flight.

On our return stopover, we were on schedule to catch our flight back to Boston when the pilot announced that there seemed to be an issue in Charlotte. We knew this could not be a good thing.

What ensued was a complete cluster on the part of Charlotte personnel. We learned much, much later (like after we missed our connecting flight) that one of the moving walkways in the middle of the building caught fire. Okay, so you're saying, ""hey that's not their fault"" but it was the complete lack of leadership, lack of personnel to keep throngs of anxious passengers calm, lack of transparency about the ongoing situation, etc.

We were held hostage for what seemed like an eternity,  while one airport worker would tell people that shuttle busses would be forming at a certain gate to transport passengers to the other side of the airport, so the masses would scramble to get there, only to be told later that busses weren't coming. Then we're told okay maybe they are coming, but to a different gate. Announcements were made that all planes were grounded and no one would miss their flight, only to get to the gate after the fiasco to learn all flights left on schedule.

The mob scene that ensued once the fire was cleared was nothing short of a disaster film. Pushing and shoving to cram onto escalators, maneuvering around fire apparatus...had this been an actual emergency, you would probably just take a seat and kiss your a** goodbye.

We waited THREE HOURS for the next plane that wasn't already full, paid an outrageous amount of money for food and drink to pass the time (because after that, yeah you need drinks and money is no object.)

It is easy to find your way around, offers lots of options on food should you get stuck here for a lengthy time. The area for rental cars was under construction when I visited, meaning you have to walk outside and across the street to rent your car. Which I didn't mind because at least it isn't like other airports where you have to shuttle away from the property to just get to the rental counter. That aside this place was clean and the TSA line wasn't obnoxiously long. Although... Because there is only one terminal area for all flights there are three maybe four TSA lines to pick from. So be careful that you don't pick one that is heavily trafficked, and don't think all lines are that bad if you do. Our first sight of one of the TSA lines would easily have had us waiting for over an hour, but I waited in line while my friend ran to check out another, only to discover that another line was nowhere near as long. So I hurried across the airport to join them and we were in and out of TSA in maybe 5-10min. Good airport to be in.",2,0,1

I mean part of the confusion with recycling and why I personally feel people don't do it is because they're unsure of what to recycle and where it goes.  But with this 'toss it... sort it' effort, it's a no brainer.

Pluses:
I do love the Jetson styled moving walkway
Various faith based religious services available on Sunday
Cool rocking chairs strategically placed throughout and along concourse

Minuses:
I would love to see more charging stations
More adaptable jet bridges, walking on the tarmac is sooooo lame

All in all, this airport is pretty cool.",8,6,6

Giant rocking chairs line the main food court between terminals and an abundance of food choices makes picking a restaurant hassle free. My only complaint is that it is a US Airways hub and every US flight that I've been on in the past month has either been canceled or delayed without reason.

Anyway...Charlotte's airport is BY FAR the best airport I have ever flown through.  For one thing, they are great about keeping things on time unless a flight is delayed from somewhere else.  I know this is more the airline, but I have never been delayed here.

They have great food and coffee places, shopping options and plenty of walking room through terminals.  And, my favorite are the huge open windows and rocking chairs to relax in while you are waiting for your next flight.  It is the ""homiest"" airport ever. :)

Charlotte- Douglas is one of my very favorite airports and a very pleasant place to stop over for a while between flights on the way to somewhere else. 

It's not only clean but sparkling and squeaky clean. Things actually shine and it looks like you could literally eat off the floor. Pretty amazing with all those people thumping, thomping and thudging though it. 

The inside of the the airport is actually fun to explore and walk around, with line of trees, some very cool rocking chairs and little airplanes hanging overhead. Lots of corners to hang out in and plenty of little restaurants and shops scattered about. Even a people mover and escalators to play on although the things move too slowly to really have fun on. 

Sure it's an airport and everyone is in a hurry, some people are grumpy and the typical airport chaos does happen, but overall the folks I have meet here were are friendly and very hospitable. A nice contrast to the abrupt hostility sometimes found in employees of other airports. I'm always happy to see that my flight has a stop over in Charlotte- Douglas because I know I can have fun and will have no trouble killing a few hours here while waiting for another flight. Maybe someday I'll actually get out of the airport and see the city.",21,18,21

What I didn't hear about was how congested it gets once inside.  Let's start from the beginning....I made a trek from South Carolina to Charlotte Airport and I ended up noticing  that there aren't many gas stations on the way to fill up.  I ended up finding a tiny gas station that did the trick.  Thank goodness.  I ended up driving back to the Hertz lot and dropping off my car.  The rental buses are relatively quick but the guy that was DRIVING -- SUCK!  Let me make that clear - HE SUCKKKKEDDD!!!  I clearly am not the type to ask too much from anyone so when I ask you very nicely and say 'Can you please help me get this into the bus?' and you just look at me like I'm crazy I seriously contemplate throwing my cell phone at you (not that I'm violent).  It's not that it was so heavy, it was more so that I had my work stuff, my purse, and the suitcase.  I was going to do the majority of the lifting, I just needed an ounce of strength. So naturally, he didn't want to help so I took my sweet time -- holding everyone else up because this idiot didn't think that the faster I could get this woman in and out the faster these people can get to the airport.  Anyways,  we get finally get to the terminal and just because I was annoyed I waited until everyone was out to see if the driver was going to at least ATTEMPT to ask me if I needed help.  Nope he didn't, so naturally I just stood there and looked at him and he decided to get my bag (as well he should).  **Caveat** The way he was struggling with that bag made me think his weak a** could've used more bag lifting to get some more strength in his arms.  Moving on.....

The US Airways terminal was packed as usual, I expect no less.  I'm a United flyer and have always, always dreaded flying US Airways but I had no choice.  I gritted my teeth and checked my bag.  I prayed that I would get there at the same time my bag did.  Going through security was ridiculous -- I have status -- and it was still ridiculous.  I was even told by one of the TSA gate agents multiple times to make sure I'm an ""Elite"" passenger.  Little did she know I know what the hell I'm doing.  I've only been traveling all of my life.  What she should've been doing is assisting those SAME people that kept walking through the metal detector with BELTS and COINS in their pockets.  My security episode was only 30 minutes -- 15 minutes longer then it should've been.  I get through security and notice the tight space of this terminal.  I just don't understand why this place is so tight and I realize there is NO SPACE to move around.  Annoyed I see the Chili's and want the strongest drink they have.  I was really excited to see that the waitress felt my pain and told me she would help me out that day.  I had a little burger and a few strong drinks and tipped her quite well!!  I was surprised US Airways boarded the plane ON TIME!  First for EVERYTHING!  There are a few things I do NOT like about US Airways but I won't share them on this post since we're only talking about CLT.  

Bottom line:  CLT can use some work just with overall efficiency.  TSA Agents could do themselves a favor and not nag the hell out of people in the security lines and focus on those ones that seem to be holding up the line.  Between Charlotte and RDU -- I'll take RDU.",1,1,1

I don't recall the gate number I came in on - but went out on D6... It took me for EVER to get from my incoming flight (from HSV - Huntsville, AL) - to my connecting flight to TPA (Tampa, Florida) - and the walk alone was ridiculous at best.  

Sure, there are moving sidewalks - and those are great - 
There are rocking chairs along the way that you need to take a rest in if you're having to walk the what felt like 5 miles between flights.  Had my incoming and outgoing flights not been an hour in between - I'm not certain I would have made my flight.

The airport is very clean - any of the staff I came across were very polite and customer focused - but the lack of a tram to take passengers from one concourse to the next is painfully missing.

The food options are rapidly improving and places like the 1897 are a real boon to the airport. The only major downside is the lack of Chick-fil-a (seriously! we're in North Carolina!). The layout is easily navigable and pretty simple to get around despite the huge size and massive amount of flights that come and go.

There are many options for food in the main area where all of the terminals meet. They have a pretty decent directory which is nice because many airports seem to lack those. They even have people in yellow shirts (I think) to tell you where to go if you're lost or looking for a place to eat. That's also pretty nice. In the bathrooms, they have those awkward-as-heck attendants to give you mints and kleenex and they have a tip jar behind them as if to say ""tip me! you just took a poop now get out your wallet!"" lol... yeahhh.

Overall the terminals I went to were fairly clean. They have a spa near the main area which is always a plus for me, if I have the layover time to get my nails 'did, lol. But I am sure the prices are super high, because, well, it's an airport! They can get away with that shit.

The Chili's was kind of blah, though. Sean and I stopped there for a burger before our flight back to St. Louis and it was way overcooked. When we asked the waitress about it she told us they ""aren't allowed to cook them medium or below."" Weird. I have never heard of such a thing before but maybe airport Chili's is different than normal Chili's because Sean always raves about Chili's burgers. It's one of his favorite restaurants to eat at so the airport location was kind of a let down.

Edit: A North Carolina Yelper informs me that this is due to a law in N.C. about not letting restaurants cook burgers at certain temps due to an e.coli breakout. Thanks for the info! I had no idea otherwise, lol.

Also, before my flight to Daytona, I stopped by their sushi bar\/restaurant also near Chili's and got some special made tuna rolls. They weren't bad but these people clearly have no idea how to make a sushi roll. Each one was so massive I almost choked when eating it. The tuna did look fresh though albeit a little bloody. Weird. I couldn't finish them all mostly due to the size. It was hella overpriced too. I saw they had a Phillip's Seafood restaurant in Terminal C or something and I reeeeally wanted to go there but it was too far to walk and then have to walk back to our gate...we would have never made it in time.

I'm currently 28,000 feet in the air and Yelping to avoid thinking about that fact and the two hyperactive 8 year olds who are literally wrestling in the seat behind me. 

Right, so I hate flying, But I do love a good airport. Maybe it's just that I'm so ecstatic to have my feet back on the ground, or maybe it's that airports like Charlotte's instill in me a sense of adventure, even a bit of nostalgia for the days when flying was a bit more romantic. 

Bright and airy, with plenty of moving walkways to help you traverse the terminals rather painlessly, CLT (perhaps in spite of its unfortunate call letters) is spacious and welcoming. The connecting space between terminals is lined with live trees and an abundance of white rocking chairs (and the occasional live piano music). The bathrooms each have an attendant which, granted, was really bizarre the first time I experienced this, but I've become accustomed to their greetings. One of them used to even sing a sort of ongoing gospel wishing everyone a safe flight. That's called character, people, and this airport's got it.

If there's one downfall it's that the older terminals were clearly not designed for the larger planes. There's almost never enough seating for the passengers waiting to board, and it's almost always overcrowded in these areas. 

Got a long layover? The first good news is you've got access to free WI-FI. And you won't be disappointed by the food and drink options - I have one very fond memory of a long liquid lunch at the Bacardi Rum restaurant (yep -  apparently that's a thing).
