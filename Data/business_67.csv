-Smoked meat sandwich (Medium Fat) - $9.35:
One serving had at least 2 pounds of thick cut smoked meat and you can order your meat from lean to extra fat. 
I honestly didn't care for the rye bread as it was quite dry but the smoked meat ... YUM! Since I ordered the meat medium, I got some of the buttery fat that literally melted in my mouth. That little zing from the mustard complimented perfectly with the fatty meat, but I wished there was more!

Schwartz's is a very basic restaurant in terms of atmosphere. Nothing but a bar and a bunch of tables. While this might deter some people, I feel this is part of the charm.

One thing that caught me by surprise is that there doesn't seem to be any combos. I wanted a smoked meat sandwich, fries and a soft drink, so I had to buy each item separately. After tax and tip, this comes to about $20.

The smoked meat is quite good, although it is of the drier variety which is not my favourite. The fries were fine as well.

We ordered a smoked meat sandwich which had a lot of meat stuffed in it. The meat was good, soft, and tender. I wouldn't say it's the best smoked meat out there though.

The food is good, and the prices are reasonable. When it comes to the smoked meat sandwich you have a choice between lean or regular with more fat. If you want it to be moister don't go with the lean but either I'm sure tastes great. When I was there we got a fries to share, and also a pickle to share which I think was a good call.

VRIO Framework

Value: Neutralizes external threats with unique mandatory 10 day meat curing time and high inventory turnover. Smoked meat sandwiches are served by fat content: lean, medium and fat. The theory of YOLO (You Only Live Once) suggests fat. As well, the theory of YOLO also suggests a cheesy smoked meat poutine, the ingestion of your weekly fat intake in one sitting. 

Rarity: Patrons love Schwartz's like fat kids love pie. Limited supply and persistence over time are contributions to its recipe of success.  Expect a plate of succulent smoked meat. 

Imitability: Schwartz's brand is inimitable. The ""hole in the wall"" décor speaks to its 80 years of history.  This even allows Schwartz's to add merchandizes to its product mix. 

Organization: Complementary capabilities of staff, supplier and culture. The orders are cascaded in a transparent reporting structure. 

Don't forget to complete your meal with artificially flavoured black cherry soda!  Disturbing an 80 years-old carefully designed product mix tradition is bad karma!",2,2,2

I was already satisified with my warm, tender meat served on a fresh rye bread with mustard ($6.65). Next time I'll definitely try the kill-me-fatty option! LOL.

A nice surprise was the cherry coke. I'm never a fan of artificial cherry products, but since almost every table ordered this, so why not give it a try. Oh, It was AMAZING!!! It completely changed my perceptions of all cherry drinks tasted like cough syrup. It was addictive, and a perfect companion of the fatty smoked meat.

Tips: 
- There is a minimum order of $1.50 per person.
- Take out smoked meat (cold) is $1.00 cheaper per pound if you can heat it up yourself at home.
- Go there before 12noon to avoid huge lineups!
- Cash only.",4,0,1

Fortunately, I went in the middle of the afternoon on a weekday in November so I only waited 10 mins or so for seats at the bar. It was, at first, overwhelming to order but the guy behind the counter simplified it. There is really only one thing to get -- the smoked meat sandwich. I opted for the middle option (some fat, some lean) and it was delicious. Food came out super quick and paired with fresh, hot fries and a pickle, it was an extremely satisfying meal.

My gripes with organized religion aside, until I went to college, my impression of Jewish food consisted only of things that were somewhat hinted in the bible about the Israelites' travails in the desert -- I think up until about 18 I believed that the story of the Jews were that of an overzealous nation led by a capricious voice in the sky who pretty much gave and took away land from his\/her own people, while at the same time depriving them culinarily by forcing them to eat unleavened bread and order well-done steaks all the time.

I was pleasantly surprised, when I was first introduced to a proper reuben at Schilo's Deli in San Antonio, and my perception and admiration of Jewish cuisine had been on the rise ever since then; from that point I made it a point to pilgrimage all the holy sites of all that is bagel and\/or smoked meat -- I never even once would have imagined that one of those holy sites would have been in the beautiful city of Montréal.

If you've read this far in my review, you'll notice that I have yet to make a single constructive comment that would be construed as being part of a review. That's because I haven't. I can't quite put into words what I think about Schwartz's, because it's so very much like every landmark Jewish deli I've been to, but at the same time so different as well.

The atmosphere at Schwartz's is one you'd expect from any popular establishment in a bustling city. I've walked and passed by Schwartz's at least four times and each time there was a huge line in front of both the restaurant and the take out area. Whereas the take out area is indeed miles faster than waiting in line to be seated at the restaurant, you still have to wait about 30-35 minutes to get your hands on any sort of tangible food while having to suffer through the alluring aroma of freshly-drained, smoked-for-many-hours meat invading ever orifice of your body as you stand (yes, your dog will love the way you smell after you leave this place)

The food here is mindblowing if you've never tried a brisket\/smoked meat sandwich before. If you have, it's just like anything you'd get at Katzs'\/Second Ave\/Herschel's, except Schwartz's sandwich packs in around the same amount of meat as the aforementioned places (except for Second Ave's. Nothing beats a whole pound of brisket sloshed in between two pieces of rye bread) into three tiny pieces of white, almost wonderbread-esque bread (think Texas BBQ.) It's almost like a poorly constructed Pyramid that was built to preserve a cow that met a horrifying death, and if that wasn't enough, incinerated extremely slowly so to keep all its juices locked into the flesh. Disturbing mental images aside, it's pretty amazing.

The price point is probably what sets Schwartz's apart from most of the Jewish delis I've been to. Whereas you'll come out of places like Katzs' and Second Ave about 20-25 dollars poorer after a meal, Schwartz's only charges 7.75 CAD per sandwich. One can maybe make the argument that Katzs' and Second Ave makes up the difference in the amount of time you don't spend waiting for your food(nothing beats being able to walk up to the Sandwich line at Katzs', sampling the specimen from whence your sandwich meat came, and watching it being constructed right before your eyes within 2 minutes of entering the establishment.) My friend and I saw the pictures online and made the mistake of thinking that one sandwich would not be filling enough and that we'd each need to order two or three. That was also a huge mistake.

All in all a great establishment in a great part of town. I'd definitely recommend Schwartz's as a part of the Montréal experience to anyone visiting the city. I don't know if their online catering\/order service delivers to the US as well, but I'm really kicking myself for not grabbing one of their ready-to-heat brisket vacuum paks for my drive home.",0,1,0

Schwartz's est une charcuterie hébraïque, l'un des restaurants de sandwichs à la viande fumée les mieux connus de Montréal. Une institution, vraiment ?! C'est pas parce que c'est recommandé par les guides touristiques et visité par les vedettes que c'est grandiose.
 
L'intérieur respire la médiocrité, la friture et le gras. L'ambiance est bruyante et peu chaleureuse. Le confort n'existe pas, grâce à des tables minuscules et des chaises bien rigides dans un espace étriqué. Un service minimum est offert par des serveurs indifférents, qui toutefois n'hésiteront pas à signaler : ""Pour info, le pourboire ici c'est 15 % minimum."". Tout est fait pour nous inciter à manger vite et à libérer notre place aussitôt. Et ça tombe bien, c'est exactement ce qu'ils veulent, parce qu'il y a d'autres pigeons qui attendent derrière.
 
J'y ai fait 2 passages, commandant une première fois un smoked meat en sandwich et l'autre fois un smoked meat en assiette garnie. Et invariablement, j'ai trouvé cela grossier et sans intérêt. La viande déborde de gras et le pain est à la limite du rassis (et ce n'est pas la moutarde aspergée approximativement qui change quelque chose). J'ai goûté du smoked meat plus savoureux, notamment au pub Burgundy Lion, qui n'est même pas spécialisé là-dedans.

Bread: Not the traditional Jewish rye I am used to -  it was a softer, smaller version of the classic deli sandwich bread. 

Meat: Succulent and you really get a variety of type in your sandwich (finely chopped, thinly sliced, etc)  - the burnt fatty ends were the highlight. 

The sandwich itself is smaller then your NYC Delis, but the price reflects that as well. The one knock I have was the brown mustard was not available as a free condiment. They do sell the brown mustard in a bottle, which was a little frustrating as I expected it to be available for free.",0,0,0

It's literally a hole in the wall but it's pretty efficient having take out in one completely separate entrance, and the sit down part in another unit (although it would be nice if they could just combine that all)

We got a table right away for 2 on Thursday at 3pm. I had a hard time looking for a menu due to the seat I had but to my embarrassment there were two large wall menus I just didn't bother looking up! It does reduce fumbling in the tight space so that is nice. I did notice the staff were friendly and actually having legitimate conversations with customers which definitely gave the nice cosy family vibe.

I had meat sandwich with poutine and a tea. He had meat sandwich with a pickle and black cherry soda. I was super jealous because his juicy pickle went perfectly with the sandwich and the soda was so good!!! Luckily he was willing to share :')

Washrooms were clean and surprisingly there was one for each gender considering how small the place was I thought that was impressive! 

One improvement I have is I wish the bread slices for the sandwich were a bit thicker as I feel like the bread was too soggy due to the amount of meat grease and mustard that fills up the bread.

The atmosphere was a very traditional Jewish deli and, despite the long line and cramped seating area, the crew did a good job in keeping everyone moving and at the same time not rushing.

Finally inside and seated at the counter, pastrami's everywhere.I order the sandwich and get ready to sink my teeth into deliciousness. No such luck, below average pastrami and rye bread. The coleslaw was runny, and the meat really fatty. Guess I'm used to good smoked deli meats being from Los Angeles and eating at deli's most of my life. 

Immediately I'm disappointed but what the hell I'm in Montreal and it's beautiful outside. While I'm walking I see several other smoked meat restaurants and they all are empty. I go inside one called Slovenka and it smells heavenly. Don't get the draw of Schwartz's other then it was original and old.",3,0,0

As you may have noticed from the photos, the sandwiches are basically 90% meat and 10% bread. It takes skill and training to be able to eat the sandwich while keeping it intact. The meat is oh-so tender and, in the true Quebecois fashion, is grease through and through. The mustard also blends well with the grease. 

On any given day you'll see a mix of tourists and locals lining up in front of Schwartz's for a bite of the delicious meat. The wait is normally around 30 minutes, but you can shorten that wait to 15 minutes if you get takeout instead (at the takeout shop right next door).",2,1,2

You have  two options here, go the sit down route and wait in that horrendous line or do the take out route and be in and out in 15 minutes.  Since we didn't want to waste our limited time in Montreal standing in line, we did option two.  Food here is pretty cheap you can get one of their sandwiches for $8.00 CAD (IIRC) and fries for another $2.00 or so.  This pricing of course is infinitely cheaper than what Carnegie Deli or Katz's Delicatessen will charge you.  Hell you can get TWO sandwiches at Schwartz's for the NYC equivalent.  

However, the big difference is in the size.  Katz's sandwich is huge, piled high with so much meat you could make two sandwiches out of it.  So I guess on price, it's about even.  The smoke meat at Schwartz's has a rich and deep flavor but what I disliked was how dry it actually was.  Because it was so dry, the juicy goodness of Katz's wins hands down.  I never quite understand why these Jewish delis use crappy rye bread to hold down such a massive amount of meat, they always tend to fall apart quite quickly and make a mess.

Its served straight up, tons of slices of meat between rye with a spread of mustard.  And thats really it.  No frills.  Just a lot of meat, smoked and cured and resmoked again.

At one point, I saw a garbage bin sized food-grade container being carried by two large, struggling men from the kitchen to behind the counter, full of the famous smoked meat. I watched each cut, nearly 200 lbs. worth, be unloaded out by fork, and be given the final pinch test for tenderness. Some were segregated to an insulated container to continue softening, some were ready for temporary sequestration before slicing. The meat then goes to the workspace of a very fat man with a messed up eye, whose sole job is to slice the meat, which he did with a rhythmic panache, his jaw swaying agape in a chewing motion, almost davening with each cut. An older fellow then slowly makes the sandwiches with rye bread and mustard, his hands pressing them into the well-worn plates with a tender push, the meat fat still jiggling off the sides, mesmerizing the packed-in customers under its tender, pink, shiny spell.

They didn't have small to go containers so he offered the larger container and actually filled the entire thing for me and my friend (who ordered the same) at no additional charge. This had to be the best poutine I had by far while I was in Montreal.

Don't know what poutine is? Well picture this: french fries (at the bottom), gravy, cheese curds, and a myriad of Montreal's famous smoked meat. This is a popular Canadian dish and you should not leave Canada without having tried it.  

Towards the back of the establishment there is limited seating for patrons. However, they have a bulletin board with newspaper clippings, photos, and notes from patrons. It was amazing to see how many people have come to Shwartz's from all over the world. Trust me when I say all those people weren't lying when they named Shwartz's the best deli in all of Montreal.

Upon seeing how crowded it was on our arrival, we decided to take our sandwiches to go and sit on a nearby bench.

Honestly, it was... bland. About as exciting as eating moist cardboard spread with lard. The pickle was sour and nasty, and there was so little bread to contain the meat that the sandwich fell apart and I had to finish it with a fork. I guess this is how smoked meat connoisseurs like it?

There's a corner store a block down the other side of the street that sells Vietnamese sandwiches for $2 which are easily twice as good.",4,0,1

The first time, the take out next door was closed so we just asked for take out from the restaurant instead. They did have plenty of available tables but we just wanted to enjoy these delicious sandwiches in the confines of our hotel. I did expect the sandwiches to be like a foot high like the ones from Katz, but this was more on the smaller side. Although, it is a lot cheaper than Katz. Definitely ask for medium or else they give you lean meat. The brisket was tender and flavorful. We also tried the fries and they gave us packets of vinegar and ketchup. I never had fries with vinegar before but it did go well. They were crispy and fresh just like the ones from Pomme Frites in NYC. I do regret not trying their poutine though. 

On the second visit, we experienced a HUGE line for the restaurant as well as the take out next door. Guess it really depends on what time you go. Bring cash or else they charge a 10% extra when paying with American Dollars!",0,0,1

The restaurant has a very deli feel to it, as that's exactly what it is. It's not the type of food you sit down to eat, it's more of a wait in line, grab a sandwich and walk around the street type of deal.

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

Schwartz's is the definition of no frills, but the friendly staff are accommodating even if the place is packed with a line out the door (which is likely). I grabbed a seat at the bar, asked for the goods, and had a steaming hot sandwich in front of me in no time. Star Granted. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

If they wanted, Schwartz's could easily charge a ridiculous premium for their sandwiches - but they don't, and my standard sammie came in at $8.70. Have a look:

http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?userid=OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHg&select=NMfOyuZAKwhLRoDtGWsdAw

That's fair. Star Granted. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

Make no mistake, this was absolutely marvelous. Sure, the bread and mustard are standard white and yellow, but the meat is absolutely heavenly. Slow smoked so that it's tender, but the consistency is maintained to where it doesn't fall apart and the flavor mixes a nice lean cut with just the right band of fat and seasoning. Brilliant. Dual Stars Granted. 

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

It's damn close, but as hard as it might be to believe, on one occasion I had a smoked meat sandwich that was better than this on account of the slightly better bread and equal meat:

http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/mile-end-delicatessen-brooklyn-brooklyn?select=f-3HfCK5xgXY82ARMEbeHw&userid=OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHg#f-3HfCK5xgXY82ARMEbeHw

So, that exists, which makes it such that I can't quite go with the full five stars here. Make no mistake, you should absolutely come to Schwartz's as it's the best in the city by a mile, but it didn't quite secure the crown. No Star Granted.",1,0,1

Sandwich #4 (quarter pound smoked meat): 5\/5. Tender, perfectly seasoned, not salty or bland, the fat isn't greasy but makes great fusion with the lean in terms of texture and aroma.

He very graciously offered his advice: they serve a lot of good food at Scwhartz's but there is only one meal to order: a medium smoked meat sandwich (as apposed to lean or fatty), an order of fries, a 1\/2 sour pickle and a cherry cola. BAM! Incredible. On first inspection  the sammy appears huge. One doubts one's ability to take  it down. Fear not. The meat is so perfectly prepared that it just melts on the tongue. The taste, the smell, the sides, the salt of the meat and\/or the pickle contrasting with the cherry cola. Wow. 
You won't have to eat much the rest of the day and have access to a steady supply of water. A lot of salt in that meal, you'll be thirsty.

And if this means anything to you reading this...it was well worth it.  I would have walked 8 more miles if I had to, considering the amazing smoked meat on those sandwiches, laid back neighborhood friendly atmosphere, and very reasonable prices.

Upon entering, because this place had no available table, we opted to go sit at the ""bar"".  No, there is no liquor service here, just amazing food.  Once seated, the guy behind the counter immediately started asking for our orders, for which we opted for combo smoked sandwiches, orders of fries, and cherry cola for me.

When the sandwiches arrived, we were all focused and quiet, devouring our food.  I personally preferred tasting every bite, as this was indeed a very tasty treat.  Just enough fat, topped with a tad of mustard, and wrapped in freshly baked bread.  Simple, tasty, delicious!  Sometimes, keeping things simple is the way to go.

I ordered a simple brisket sandwich (yes, they speak English) and sausages. The first bite of that moist and smokey meat had me prancing around like a little girl in the shop.

While there is another female singer associated with Schwartz's (more on that later) it was Carly Simon who set the theme for my Schwartz's experience. 

We showed up on a Friday afternoon and were greeted with a short line outside. However, we only waited about 3 minutes because two seats opened up at the counter. I'm telling you, traveling in a duo is the way to go when it comes to popular eateries. This encounter was a three-way of simplicity: smoked meat sandwich, fries, and a black cherry soda. With a little extra sumpin' sumpin' in the form of a dill pickle that was large enough for two people to share. 

Oh holy hell. One the best sandwiches I've ever eaten. I intended to save half, but once I dove in there was no way I was stopping. Somehow, in an alchemy of food magic, three simple ingredients - meat, rye bread, mustard - combined to achieve sandwich nirvana. The fries were crispy and delicious, with the perfect amount of salt. 

Then, there was the black cherry soda (Cott's Black Cherry Soda, to be precise), which put this meal over the top. It was unlike any carbonated beverage I've ever tasted. I couldn't find it in the grocery store near where we were staying, but managed to snag a few cans at the Montreal airport. Had I known that the customs process was over and liquids were OK, I would have bought out their entire supply. I still have a can in my fridge that I cannot bring myself to drink. If anyone from Montreal is reading this, be my Cott's supplier and we will be BFFs for Lyfe. Other black cherry flavored sodas just don't compare. And it's not even like I have a particular interest in black cherries, this stuff is just AMAZING. 

Back to Schwartz's. The counter staff was very friendly and efficient. It was an overall great experience. I probably would have gone back, but there's just so much good food to try in Montreal. The very next day I saw on the news that Celine Dion had been at Schwartz's just a little after our visit. So even if you don't believe me, TRUST CELINE.

Waiting for 10 min for a table is fine, but standing in a long line in the street for a restaurant is a no-no. There are way too many excellent restaurants in the city for that.

Every time my parents visit Montréal, we always have to go one time because they love their smoked meat sandwiches. In my opinion, it can be kind of hit or miss because of the way they break down the fat while cooking the meat, which I find can be somewhat gummy at times and not melt-in-your-mouth. You could always solve that problem by ordering a lean cut, which I normally wouldn't choose because I find fattier meat more flavorful, but that's usually when it comes to Chinese meat preparation rather than the Western style. Other than that, however, they season it really well, and for some reason I think their mustard is the best I've ever tasted (I could literally just buy bottles of them; please don't judge me).

So at Kat's deli (my current NYC favorite)... the first thing you get is the pastrami on rye with mustard... at Schwartz's, you get the smoked meat on rye with mustard. We had the option of lean, medium, or fatty. To be on the safe side, we went with medium because the lean might be a bit dry... a decision I ended up regretting. Should have gone with fatty. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious. I just wish there was more fat on it... personal taste, not because there was something wrong with medium. 

The flavor of the smoked meat sandwich was not as salty as New York pastrami... a BIG plus for Schwartz's. And it's actually easily manageable. I have never EVER been able to eat a Kat's sandwich without it falling apart on me. Sure we get to pick at the pastrami after we're done, but the fact that its so salty... doesn't sit as well as a clean sandwich.

The only downside is that Schwartz's is not in New York. Schwartz's wins. Hands down.

Schwartz's is the place to be for Montreal Smoked Meat, so I was informed.
If my Deli encounters taught me anything, I'm definitely in for something special.
It's with sorrow that I did not find the Montreal Smoked Meat overly impressive.

One big bite set my sense wondering, second bit bite got me even more curious.
Third big bite and I had to open up my Sandwich($6.15) to see what's going on.
It's the texture of the Meat that is different from the usual as I used my Fork.

As I Fork it, I see the Meat surface tends to dry out quite rapidly after slicing.
The Meat shreds easily, a little bit too easily without any effort falls apart.
The usually fat marbling connecting Meat strands has disappeared.
That lead to a less juicy less resistant Meaty style bite.  Toothpick required.
Doesn't signal my snarling carnivorous side of the brain as much unfortunately.

Trying not to be bias after one tasting, I requested a second Smoked Meat.
One with more Fat and it came but not quite what I was expecting.
It's the Medium Fat Meat with some slices of Fat Cap layered on top.
It gives much better juiciness and way way more fattiness. It's basically a cover up.

It's not perfect but it's still a good quality product above some others.
For the price, it's reasonable and down-to-earth considering the Tourist crowd. Kudos.
The Pickles($1.75) are a good snack to help with digesting the Fat.",3,0,1

Just about everyone I discussed eating options with in Montreal told me to check this place out, unfortunately I was underwhelmed. As expected there was a long line when we arrived around 3pm. It appears they play favorites to known patrons as parties with the same number of individuals that were way behind us in line were seated before we were. The service or lack thereof was definitely horrible. 

When we were finally seated, no one took our orders for fifteen minutes as we watched them serve those that were seated after us. Under normal circumstances we would have left but given the sacrifice we made waiting in line in the rain and the hype that led to the visit, we had to experience this ""delicacy"". When someone in our party decided to call a server's attention to the delay in taking our orders, he barked at us in French even though he had spoken to everyone else in perfectly fine English. I had never experienced anything like that before. It was rude, obnoxious and very unprofessional. 

Now to add salt to the wound, my sandwich was AWFUL. It was served with a whole pickle, some fries and a can of soda. The mustard coated thin bread slices were almost non-existent for the amount of salty smoked meat served. To me, a street served pastrami sandwich in New York is waaaay better. It was just A LOT OF SALTY MEAT. No one should consume that amount of sodium in a seating!

All I can say is we got to to experience this tourist trap and not only was it overpriced for the quality, it was also such a waste of time for subpar food. This is a place to visit at 3am when you are completely sht-faced and need just about anything to soak up all that alcohol.",2,1,0

We sat on a bench and when I unwrapped the sandwich I had to swallow immediately or I would have drooled. The smell was so tantalizing and meaty. I applied mustard and took an enormous bite.

Schwartz's reminds me of Katz Deli in Manhattan but it looks dirtier, smaller but the Jewish servants remain. Their smoked meat sandwich is not as meaty as Katz but it is juicier and tastier. They don't have fancy sauces but yellow mustard. Surprisingly, it is good enough for all of us. 

Their dill is also great as well as their coleslaw. Try the black cherry soda with your sandwich and get used to being cramped inside.

I'm one of the crazy fanatics who will wait over an hour in -20 degree (Celsius) weather in a snow storm just to get my smoked meat sandwich.  I average about 4 visits a year to this greasy joint and in between I sometimes have authentic Schwartz smoked meat brought back to Ontario for me.  

Let's start with the food:
Tastiest meat ever.  I almost always go for the smoked meat sandwich - medium-fat.  It's definitely on the greasy side, but the fat adds the juiciness.  We once shared a table with a local regular who was disappointed we didn't order full fat.  Her sandwich looked super juicy, but I'm not sure my heart could take it.  When my health-conscious friend ordered extra lean, I could see it was significantly drier.

Schwartz's french fries are my absolute favourite.  They're a thicker cut, they're super greasy and they're cooked just enough to be crispy on the outside but still have the softer middles.  

Steak, liver and pickles are also fantastic, but I have regretted not sticking to the sandwich.  The smoked meat is just that good.

Beverage:
Secret recipe - 1\/3 regular Coke, 2\/3 Cott's Black Cherry.  You have to order by the can, so you do the math.  The glasses they provide are tiny, but sufficient.  I don't think I've tried anything other than this cherry Coke concoction but the stacks of pop in the backroom suggest they offer a good variety of other beverages.

Atmosphere:
The reason there's usually a line-up outside Schwartz is because the restaurant is tiny. It's very narrow and there's not much room for a line-up inside.   On a cold day we're allowed to squeeze between the bustling waiters, the take-out customers and the customers eating at the counter.

The entire restaurant smells of meat.  Everything is covered in a film of grease.  This is all part of Schwartz being Schwartz.  There's a certain authenticity to the place that I just love.  The wall is covered with newspaper clippings of their success.  

The restaurant is very cozy.  You're pretty much sitting shoulder-to-shoulder, knee-to-knee at the small tables.  If your party is less than 6 you'll probably have to share a table with a friendly stranger or two.  The seats at the counter don't offer much room either, so if you prefer a bit more personal space, try to get there at an off-peak time.

If possible, use the washroom before you arrive.  The washrooms at Schwartz are pretty scary.

Service:
Every time I've been to Schwartz, our waiter has been friendly, efficient, fully bilingual and can do math in his head pretty quickly.  I'm impressed with their speed and accuracy even at the busiest of times.  

The staff can be a little rude to the hungry customers in line, but they seem to do their best to accommodate everyone.

It's well worth the wait!",4,2,2

Located on St. Laurent street, there is plenty of parking on the street in and around the area.  It would be a long walk from the Old City but is very walkable from the North East area of the Mont Royal park.

There is generally a line out the door but it goes quickly.  I took off a star from the review because there isn't much room once you get inside the door.  The wall on the left hand side is lined with tables so cramped that generally the back of your chair is resting on the back of the chair of the person eating behind you.  The waiters are quick, courteous, and very accommodating even if you have a small child in your party.

As a New Yorker, I tend to compare any pastrami sandwich to that of our fabled Katz but I have to say that the hot pastrami sandwich with mustard was just as good, if not better than the one at Katz.  The only difference, a sandwich here will cost you $6 - $8 whereas the same sandwich in NYC will cost $16.  The pastrami is perfectly cooked, heaped onto rye bread, and melts in your mouth.  The hotdogs aren't bad either.

For three sandwiches and fries, the bill was around $19.  You cannot beat that.  They only accept cash and you pay up in the front of the deli.  They do take American dollars but will give change in Canadian coin.

Another couple at the other end of the table ate quickly enough that we didn't even find out where they were from.

We each ordered a smoked meat sandwich, Schwartz's specialty.  You have a choice of lean, medium or fat.  We chose medium.  Lean is reportedly too dry.  We overheard our server explain to someone that today's fat used to be medium 15 years ago, but cattle are being bred leaner these days, so they're unable to obtain the level of fat they used to.  We also ordered fries to share.  The fries came first.  There were fewer of them than at Steak Frites and they were much, much better.  The sandwiches were excellent, w\/ rye bread that was on the small side and the smoked meat piled high.  It was a manageable portion and oh so tasty.

Plus, we hadn't eaten anything more than a tiny poutine sample and some nibbles on a beer tour prior, so we were starving.

Everybody said to be prepared for a wait. As a tourist attraction, it gets busy. It was almost 6:30 pm on a Friday night when we approached the restaurant, and though there was a line out front, it wasn't nearly as bad as I had expected.

They do a good job of managing the people outside and clearing tables inside. We thought we were going to have a wait of upwards of 20 minutes ahead of us, but the guy working the line got us inside and at a table for 4 (with another couple) within five minutes.

It is crowded inside. The deli counter runs along the right side of the restaurant, taking up most of the space inside. Tables are crammed along the left side, with a very narrow aisle for servers and customers to walk down. The register is located at the front of the store (inconvenient if you're in the first table with your back to the register, like me), and the restrooms are squished in towards the back.

Menus are either above the counter or on a placemat on your table. The harried wait staff will come by to take your order, though, which is nice because fighting the crowd to get to the counter would have been a nightmare.

Our waitress suggested the smoked meat sandwich (""of course""), which we each ordered. To that, we added an order of the hand-cut fries and the pickles. 

While we waited, I tried to make small talk with the couple across from us. We were forced to sit together, and we were both trying Schwartz's for the first time. I was trying to be nice. I asked, ""So, where are you two from?"" and got, ""Ontario"" out of them before they shut me down. That didn't make for an awkward meal at ALL.

The food came out quickly, which I absolutely appreciated (because I was starving, not because the other couple was making things strange.) The pickle(s) that we had ordered turned out to be one regular-sized dill pickle, whole. The fries were a bit cold and didn't look like a whole lot.

As for the sandwich...my husband liked it a lot more than I did. The meat was good, and the bread was soft and moist, but it didn't wow me the way Katz's sandwiches did. 

It was good to try, and I'm glad we went, but after we left, we both agreed that there was no need to try to go back. It's too frenzied inside, and it's kind of pricey for what you get. You know - at Katz's you pay through the nose, but you're given a sandwich the size of your face. Here, it's kind of expensive for a regular-sized sandwich. Maybe that's just the American in me expecting everything to be ""super-sized"", though.",4,1,1

I, Ludwig Facessen, present you with a new Cannibal Resto Review. 

Sure, the meat is presented as though a freshly filleted fat man is still hanging in the back somewhere, but upon inspection, I recognized that the restaurant space is too small to accommodate multiple fat cadavers ready for consumption. 

Their cooking quarters are small, but so is their space. I was forced to dine next to two business men discussing quarters and stocks while I attempted to enjoy my disappointingly non-human meat sandwich.

Once I put ketchup on the bun, I was met with stares from the businessmen. I replied to their stares with the declaration that I would have preferred to see them between my buns. Dead and filleted. Cooked to perfection. Doused in ketchup. 

I was informed that the custom is to apply mustard and not ketchup to the meat sandwich.

The pickle tasted as though it were brined in a mix of vinegar and human body fluids so there is some hope for Shwartz's yet. 

The amount of staff that I encountered and spoke to led me to believe that this was the procession of people that I was to select from to sacrifice so I may ingest them. 
I chose a rotund lady named Rhonda. Unfortunately, there was a misunderstanding and she was not prepared to be sacrificed to quell my hunger.

However, we did go out to the movies and we're seeing each other again this coming Wednesday. Fingers crossed!

After a short spell of erraticity, the Schwartz smoked meat is back among the gods of food, gracing us with its charming and addicting taste and its luxurious texture. Shall I mention the spices? 

You know your friend who always brags about the ""dining experience"" shtick? Get that shmegegge to Schwartz's. Elementary and efficient service in a cramped deli is the ideal backdrop to the simple and natural symphony of flavor about to play on your tastebuds.

My recommendation is to sit at the counter. I saw the guy who mans it until about 9.30-ish and he is hilarious. Skip the fries and the coleslaw, but go for the pickle and the smoked meat sandwich. Hungry? Have a large plate: they'll pack whatever you can't finish in one sitting.

Believe me on that one, you won't have the guts to. The large plate is enormous. And compared to the small plate it's a bargain.

My typical fare is smoked meat sandwich and a black cherry drink. Somehow it's just delicious.

When you are ready to go, leave your tip on the table for the server and pay your bill at the cash register. Check how much they surcharge for paying with USD, when it's at parity they will take greenbacks and give you Canadian change.

Now how cool is THAT?",2,1,2

The smoked meat was really tender yet with thick cuts but didn't have much flavor and the fries were not crispy. 

Boo Boo would give this place a 3 but 4 stars is fair. I'm no pastrami expert but the sandwich tasted good to me.

I did like the cherry cola a lot. It's different and has a weird after taste which reminded of all the crap I ate growing up in the states. I couldn't find the soda in supermarkets like the IGA in downtown.

As such, I'll give advice more than a review.

Line-up outside Schwartz's? - Option 1: Takeout Counter

Depending on when you go, there can be quite a line up outside the door.  If you just want a smoked meat sandwich, fries and a pickle, you can save yourself a lot of time by just going to the takeout counter.  The prices are the same and they have some seating at the back so you can still sit and eat (while saving yourself about 30 minutes to an hour in line).

Line-up outside Schwartz's? - Option 2: Eat across the street

If you want a full sit down experience (i.e. more menu choices), I have to say I'd recommend going across the street to the Main Deli Steak House.  The smoked meat sandwich is just as good (and in my opinion, better), the service is good, and there is no line.

I guess if I head down to Montreal and I'm in the neighborhood, I'll check it out again but I don't know if I'd go to Schwartz's or Main Deli Steak House.",1,1,1

It is worth the time and the hype because locals, tourists, everyone comes here. And bring cash...it's old school here.

I was just in NYC eating a pastrami sandwich at Katz's and everyone seems to compare NY vs Montreal for deli sandwiches. Well, here's the deal - they are both great in their own ways! Only downside of Katz's is the pastrami sandwich for about the same size is $18.45 USD while the smoked meat sandwich here is $7.95 CAD.

For those who might have been disappointed with their sandwich here - key is to get some fat with your smoked meat. They will ask you if you want it lean, medium or fatty.....you only live once so get the fatty cut (I did and it was love at first bite...it literally melted in my mouth) or at a minimum the medium cut. Meat was moist and not overly seasoned - just perfect....only thing is I am used to Winnipeg rye bread (which I think is the best) so the rye here was so-so in my opinion but I won't let that affect my rating for this place.

Fries are crispy, coleslaw is perfectly tangy and provides a lightness to the meal if that's even possible. 

We waited about 40 mins in line on the Victoria Monday starting at around 1 pm. There is a take out only store beside the original restaurant but that line wasn't any better. At least we got to sit down and eat although a bit cramped. Service has it's personality and charm and food is ready relatively fast. Bathroom is small but surprisingly clean despite the age of the place and the volume of people coming through.

Can't wait till my next visit!!!

I ordered the classic smoked meat sandwich with a side of coleslaw. Unbeknownst to us, you can actually select how fatty you would like your meat to be (I recommend medium). The lean meat is nicely smoked, while the fatty meat add a great texture. Despite being a simple sandwich, you will leave stuffed with the amount of meat they stuff in there.

The star is the smoked meat sandwich, which is like a corned beef or pastrami and tender like brisket.  The meat spills out of the bread, all but making it disappear.

The smoked meats are the star at Schwartz's and I can't help but be reminded of famous Jewish delis like Katz's or Carnegie Deli in NYC.  

I ordered the smoked meat sandwich and you can choose it in fatty, medium, or lean.  I opted for it to be medium and paired it with a Black Cherry Cola as recommended.

The line to sit in the restaurant was insane, but we barely saw any lines in the to-go entrance on the left, so went there.  There's a small sitting area in the back for the to-go orders and some merchandise to purchase as well as more deli meat products.  

As soon as we put in our order, a high proportion of the patrons waiting in the restaurant line came over to the to-go line and it was soon almost equally as long.  Crazy.  Go whichever line is shortest.

Smoked Meat Sandwich - $8. it's a bit smaller than I expected but only given the price and the comparison to American oversized pastrami sandwich (which are meant for two and cost $19).  The bread is rye bread and almost seems too small for the amount of meat but that's both because they stuff the meat but also because the bread is regular\/small for a sandwich.  They put mayo and mustard, but I had to add extra of their excellent mustard for an even better kick.  

The smoked meat was great.  Like pastrami but different.  Not too salty and just right on the fattiness.   Despite my thinking the sandwich wasn't as huge as I envisioned, I was full by the end.  (the bigger guys in the group got two).

Pickle - a patron didn't want his pickle and offered it to me.  I like pickles but this was very sour and very heavily pickled.  Good with the cherry cola and thick and crunchy, but not my style. 

Smoked Meat Poutine - a friend got this variation and it's good too.  Lots of carbs, good cheese curds, delicious smoked meats, gravy.  I had a bite and you can't go wrong with poutine.  It's calories in an aluminum pan.  

Overall, I'm glad to have stopped by Schwartz's.  It's a quick and simple visit and it's no wonder the lines are so long.  I really liked the smoked meats and the mustard but bet their sandwiches used to be bigger than they are now.

It's basically a packed diner (where you have to sit with others) that offers 1 type of smoked meat. You get a ton of meat but it's basic service and cash only. We waited in line and then were so underwhelmed with the menu. I was expecting there to be at least 3 or 4 types of smoked meat to choose from but it was just your standard brisket. My friend got the liver plate. The pickle was very good. They gave me a plate of bread and a plate stacked with meat and that was that which was interesting. I tried to tell them I didn't want the bread before they ever served it so that felt very wasteful to me. The liver plate was tiny. The fries were okay but we didn't even order them so were a bit meh about having to pay for them. The waiter was friendly enough but clearly in it for the bigger parties like the six that sat down next to us and were ordering a ton of food. It wasn't worth the hype at all and I didn't feel the meat was anything special. Not a place that I'd return to.,0,1,0

I tried some of the smoked meat and it was really good! I can't even describe it, because it doesn't necessarily taste smokey, and the meat is not saucy like slow cooked beef, or dry and shreddy like pulled pork. It's tender and chewy at the same time, on the verge of falling apart but not mushy.

I came on a friday night the first time and luckily there wasn't too long of a line for the dine-in section but when I came back on sunday afternoon, the line was soooo long. It was easter sunday so i guess more people were out and about?? there was also a line in the take-out part but the line moved super quick!

You get the option of picking if you want the meat to be lean or medium fat. Definitely get with the fat because some of the pieces were super tender and juicy! Add some mustard and boom, one of the best sandwiches i've ever had hands down! Definitely will be my first stop the next time I go to Montreal.

They are cash only and also accept american dollars (USD) but there is a 10% surcharge!",6,0,1

Tasty, messy & reasonably priced. I now understand the line.",0,0,0

I have had better smoked meat - and much more of it - in delis in other cities. Seating is whoever you can find it, with others at the table. It was packed, but we were seated quickly. The best part was probably our server, who had been there 10 years and had his own act worked out.

When I got to Montreal and saw the lineup, I was like ""are you *bleeping* kidding me?"" The lineup to get a smoked meat sandwhich or purchase smoked meat was about a half hour wait, no joke! So I walked all the way to the back of the store thinking to myself, how can people wait in a line this long for a freaking sandwhich? 

Throughout the course of my waiting I chatted with my friend, who was just as curious, and grumbled to myself that this must be overrated. I may have grumbled a little too openly as when we got closer to the front of the line the man who was slicing the meat said in his most Jewish\/Brooklyn souding voice ever? ""Hey ladies, have you been here before?"" To which we answered no and that we were from Vancouver, and then just like something out of a New York TV show, he shouted down the line that ""hey we got some ladies over here all the way from Vancooovah"" and it was pretty much the most awesome part of my smoked-meat purchasing experience. He even made sure to shrink-wrap the meat we were taking back home to Vancouver. 

The sandwhich, well, it was pretty okay, I don't know if I would bother waiting in line that long again, but the pickkles.... well, that was worth waiting for! They were so big and so fresh and delish that I can hardly wait to go back and get a whole jar this year!",2,1,1

I stood outside and ate my sandwich. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't Langers or Katz pastrami. It is cheaper at like 7 dollars and they don't skimp on the meat. I just wasn't amazed.

I recently visited Schwatz's for the first time in over 8 years and opted to skip the line by visiting their takeout operation connected to the main deli. The takeout place has bar-style seating at the back, so in theory this is a decent option if you don't need a table or service.

The takeout prices seem to be the same, and I won't complain about them because they're fairly reasonable (though the cherry soda seems a bit expensive).

I ordered a fatty sandwich, fries, and a black-cherry soda. The fries aren't bad, and seem to be fairly typical Montreal fries: dark, fairly crispy, and quite short with lots of fragmentary bits.

The real letdown was the sandwich. The flavour was there, but it was deeply compromised nevertheless. Unlike previous times I've been to the sit-down portion, the smoked meat wasn't actually sliced: instead, it was chopped up and combined in order to get the desired fat profile. Although I couldn't see the grill, there were obviously pieces\/slices of meat laying on the grill, and when a customer ordered you could hear the cook chopping the meat together in order to get the right mix. This meant that some of the meat had been laying there for a while, and some of the individual pieces\/fragments (which were pea-sized) were dry and almost seared. Fresh cut slices of smoked meat this was not. Disappointing.

In contrast, if your order meat by the pound at the takeout counter you will get fresh-cut slices.",0,0,0

The high pile of meat is the star. I found it a tad dry, but still delicious. It came with a smear of mustard- I added more. I like the simplicity; you don't need to cover things up in sauces and spices if the main ingredient has quality to show. But it wasn't perfect.
Their fries were good, not over salted or greasy. I did really like their slaw- vinegary rather than mayo drenched, which perfectly cuts through the fattiness of the meat. I even piled some on into my sandwich.
The rib steak here is even better- get the Schwartz's combo and you'll get a nice fatty and flavorful steak, smoked meat, and a little cut of a tasty sausage, with slaw, fries, and a pickle. They did cook the steaks a bit more than what was ordered, they aren't thick steaks however: medium came out as medium-well, and the medium-rare found its way to the table as medium, but still equally delicious, and I did try them both.
Their liver is overcooked completely. The liver I do not recommend- dried out and far from how liver should be.

There is a wait, a line that can extend outside and down the street, and the three of us shared a table with a party of two, but I think it's what makes the place. There's nothing pretentious about it- this place is a dirty little diner. Our waiter was delightful. When I asked for fries, a pickle, and slaw, he only put in the pickle.

Numerous delis, sandwich shops and restaurants in NYC (and I'm sure elsewhere) serve tastier pastrami and corned beef sandwiches. 
The more famous shops charge close to $20 U. S. a sandwich while Schwartz only charges around $10 Canadian though the sandwich at Schwartz is quite a bit smaller. 

The smoked meat at Schwartz is quite lean and the seasoning is a bit bare bones.  It is not bad but I wouldn't drive out of my way during a visit to Montreal for a smoked meat sandwich from here. 

On the other hand the smoked meat poutine was very tasty with a delicious gravy, fries and cheese providing moisture to compliment the lean bits of smoked meat. I felt it was a lot more worth the close to $10 price tag it shares with the smoked meat sandwich.

It was divine -- it was fall off the (non-existent) bone perfect, perfectly balanced with mustard seeds and pepper.  I know other reviewers said it's large enough for two, but I happily ate my whole sandwich and am very glad I kabashed my husband's suggestion that we share a sandwich.  I do wish I'd nabbed some more mustard to add to my sandwich.  On the side, I had a plump perfect pickle which cut through the fattiness of my delicious sandwich just perfectly.  Strange that the menu had both pickles and sour pickles, but we were told they are one and the same!  

I didn't think that given the quality of the food, it was overpriced.  A little under $10 for a sizeable and truly spectacular, world-renowned sandwich and $2 for a truly massive pickle seemed reasonable to me, though being from DC, perhaps I'm simply used to being overcharged.

What the heck, just give me a plate of the smoked meat instead and i'll instantly devour it! 

For about $10 Canadian cash (which is not too shabby), you get a hot smoked meat sandwich layered with lots of smoked meat and mustard in between. So simple yet so orgasmic. Meat is so tender and juicy and it just melts in your mouth with every bite. I probably ate this whole sammie in less than 5 minutes. I had to slow down so I wouldn't choke on the meat...

Other than their popular hot smoked meat sandwiches, you can also buy other meat like turkey, chicken, and salami. They also have sides like pickles and fries. Curious in trying the other stuff but I think I'll stick with their smoke meat ;)

Schwartz's has a dine in area with a few tables and seats and also a TO-GO area with a few stools here and there. If you want to avoid the long line and wait I suggest you go get yourself a few sammies and plates of meat from the TO-GO area and eat elsewhere :).

The place is old school, for sure. The vibe is totally New York, which I like. People are piled in at tables and slamming down millions of calories of food in a very blue collar setting. Totally enjoy the vibe of the place. We were squeezed in where they could fit us. People watching was ok, though it's a small joint and reading the stuff on the walls was just as entertaining. 

We got a sandwich. For me, this is pastrami from a Jewish deli. I know, I know. Everyone is going to say that no, it's different. To me, it tasted more or less the same as a real good pastrami. It's good, it's tasty, gooey, fatty, succulent, etc etc. I am not a big enough red meat fan to say that you absolutely must go here. It was good, the sandwich was good, the experience was good.

If you are from the NY area and have eaten pastrami & corned beef all your life, don't go here. You will wonder what the fuss is all about. If that does not describe you, then you should go for it.

On a recent trip in May I brought some out of towners who wanted to eat here. Let's get things straight. Yes it's a small place and they can boss you around as a patron(like a bistro in Paris). You order lean or medium fat. Lean is dry in my opinion (need the extra mustard to choke it down) and medium is what you want to get if you want flavour. 

On our visit the service was very cordial polite and one of the guys working says they go through around 2000lbs of brisket a day there. That's a lot of beef. However this is the place to come in MTL and the tourists love it up. In Montreal you can get smoked meat at pretty much any sandwich shop in town. Heck, across the street is the Main, Ruebens on St Catherine or Snowdon Deli, smoke Meat pete's (Ile Perrot) all serve it up quite well. My favourite is in Laval at George's.  

Schwartz's did deliver for my out of town guests and I was mildly impressed. I've eaten here probably six times in 10+ years. This visit sure impressed them and that's what counts.

The smoked meat sandwich is worth getting. Meat is on point and moist enough. The bread is really soft. 

Don't leave this place without the coleslaw! It's probably the best I've had so far. It completes the sandwich!",1,1,1

Well when the hubbs wanted to come up to watch our Mets take in the Blue Jays at Stade Olympique I made it a point to come here for dinner. 
I do have to say Jewish Deli is my #1 favorite type of food. The reason for this has to come from my Grandmothers next door neighbor who IMHO made the best sour dill pickles EVER!!!!  But I digress, but will get to their pickles in a bit. 
Let me start off with the place. We get there and it is tiny with maybe 8 tables I could see that were chocked full of people. Also facing the food was a bar that had stools you could sit at. When we got there (9 on a Saturday night) the only two places to sit were at the bar which were fine by us.
Now as I have said before I love Deli food so when it comes to the meat I am a little picky.  I do prefer a more fatty cut of meat and they deliver. You have your choice of three levels of fattiness which is a nice option as not everyone enjoys the fatty part of brisket. 
The fries are amazing as they are whole potatoes that look like they are cut in house. An order is large enough to split although I tried valiantly to not hog them all but failed miserably. 
Ok now the star of the meal for me was the pickles. They were so good that I let the husband have the rest of the fries so that I could have his pickle. Putter is the brand name of them and I really wish that they had them on this side of the border.",1,0,0

Then, the service is curt because they want you in and out of there as fast as possible.  That's fine, I get it, but then you want a tip?  I get friendlier service at McDonald's.

But what really fries my latkes is their tax-evading, cash-only policy.  I don't like using cash, especially as an American tourist.  My entire trip, this was the only occasion where I couldn't use my credit card.

In addition, as a native Texan, I don't take my smoked meats lightly, particularly the holy grail of smoked meats, the brisket. There's the context.

So of course I was excited to try the O.G. of Montreal-style smoked pastrami sandwiches (the Viande Fumée) in Montreal, the legendary Schwartz's. Long story short, it did not disappoint. Fresh off a healthy night of copious refreshments, our ragtag group sought something greasy and delicious, only to be met with a ridiculously long line squirreling out both ends at Schwartz's. Popular, this place apparently is. We deftly split into two, with a couple folks waiting in each line of roughly equal length. Spoiler alert: the to-go line moves much faster.

With a few bags of greasy-delicious sandwiches and a plethora of black cherry soda, we took a short hike to the nearest park, stole some seats on a bench, and promptly devoured the meatacular sandwiches. I'm sure it was quite a sight. 

Like Texas brisket, like Fumare's amazing sandwich, there's nothing special about the setup except for the tender loving care dedicated to producing the tenderest, most succulent, melts like butter, tastes like heaven, meat you can make. That's the rub at Schwartz's. It's all about the meat, and everything else is just dressing for show.",6,4,5

We arrived a little bit past 5pm and there was a short line of 3 people... the inside looked different than the photo too... later I realized WE WERE at the to-go spot ahahahah!! Well, no worry!!! Shorter line and there are seating areas in the back!!! Yes, counter seatings only but hey, we pretty much had the whole area for ourselves!!

We ordered two smoked meat sandwiches.. one medium fat and one fatty!!! Yes, choose how lean\/fat your meat... 1 Regular poutine to share and we also grabbed a couple of Cherry Sodas from the fridge per other reviewers' recommendation. Total 38 CAD!

The order came out FAST! We had to wait 5 minutes for the poutine...

Poutine was amazing!!! the cheese was gooey and stringy.. yummmmmm!!!!! they were generous with the gravy too OMG!!!! flavor explosion in my mouth!!! A bit salty but yummmmmmm :)

The smoked meat sandwiches.. o gosh!!! I was so worried it would be wayyyy too salty.. but one bite and I was in smoked meat heaven!!! Both hubby and I preferred the fatty meat as it was juicier.. you need that little bit of fat to enjoy life! It wasn't overly fatty.. no worry!! Washed it down with the ""oh-so-refreshing"" cherry soda!! BAM!!!! amazing simple meal!!! So so so so so good!!!

It's kind of a far walk from the Mont Royal station, but I got some required souvenir shopping in as there are tons of boutiques and spots to do stroll around in.  I was heading to the airport that afternoon, and so wanted to take this sandwich to-go to unwrap at the airport and grub - because my airline did not offer any free snacks for a six-hour flight.  I answered back with Schwartz breath. 

Walked in and there was a short line, but the restaurant's seating area (which is minimal but still enough..  though you'll be stuffed like a sardine) was quite full.  They are very fast to service, and you pay and are out the door in a matter of less than 5 minutes (Wednesday around maybe 2pm?)  I asked for ""medium fat"", as that's what I'd been suggested to do.  I don't think they cared, and medium fat is probably the default.  

Anyway, I unwrapped it at the airport a couple of hours later, and although the paper wrapping and bag were soaked with some grease, the sandwich itself was not greasy.  It wasn't glistening with oil.  The grease was just from the natural fats that are melted into the meat itself, and not dripping really - since it's a dry meat.  I think it was on a mild rye toast and slathered in mustard.  Yum!  The meat is sliced medium.. and perfect for just grabbing a chunk out of your sandwich and eating with your fingers.

Just kidding.

I would be really curious to see what is the ratio tourists\/Montrealers there. No offense if you'd drive 7 hours from NY to eat their smoked meat: but I would personally not go out of my way for their stack of meat, not even on a sunny day. 

I might get killed for saying that.

We did, and we understand.  

You go for the ""smoked meat"", the deceptively generic-sounding menu mainstay. (There are other items, such as turkey, salami, and chicken, but we'll leave those for another visit).  

The smoked meat comes in three degrees of fattiness. Sorry to have to shorten your lifespans, but stick to the medium and fatty.  Schwarz's sandwich is a simple presentation of bread with a swipe of mustard.  The lean would work on a more complex sandwich, but in this presentation it's flavorless.  I worried that the the fatty would arrive with chunks of free-standing fat, but it doesn't.  There is simply more of the flavor-bearing fat elixir in the meat pile.  Go for the fatty and don't look back.  Just walk an extra, oh, ten miles or so after you eat.  

The pickles and cole slaw are outstanding, to the extent that this place would be in four or five star territory even if the meat was store-bought bologna.  The sour and dill pickles and the zesty, non-mayonnaisey slaw drew multiple ""best I've ever had"" comments from our dining party.  Vegetarians might want to stop here just for those two dishes, even if it might be a bit awkward explaining the order to the waiter.",1,0,2

Our waiter informed us you can order medium or lean. This refers to the amount of fat you want on the shaved meat. Our waiter recommended medium, so when in Rome, do as the Romans do.

It's on the smaller size, circumference-wise. But packed high with the tender as hell beef. The original simply has plain ol yellow mustard, nothing more. The bread is soft and airy, leaves optimal room for the protein!!

Perfectly cured, prepared, cooked and dished out coupled with a can of cold soda, this place can turn a humid, blistering afternoon into one refreshing, stomach bursting adventure.

Pretty much everything on the menu is good. I didn't get everything but I got a wide cross section of their offerings. Just eat the meat as the bread will just slow you down.

Few things that I have to speak on that's not food related but will affect your visit here. First off, if you're driving here, you're going to have one hell of a time finding a parking spot. Be prepared to park a few blocks away and make sure it's ok. The markings are unclear and confusing at best and if parked in the wrong place, you'll get a ticket or worse yet, get towed. When in doubt, go into a store nearby and ask the worker there for some parking tips as they should be familiar with the area. Most people on the streets are either assholes who refuse to talk to you or just as clueless as you are. Second, the wait is long. And when I say long, it can go up to two hours. My cousin stood in line 45 mins before we arrived and we waited another 45 mins after we found parking and walked over to where he was standing in line. I do not suggest groups of more than 4. You will not find a table together unless you want to wait over 2 hours. Third, it's really crowded in here. You'll be sitting close to your neighbors so be prepared to be engaged in some friendly chatter with your seatmate. Lastly, order everything at once. Because it's so busy and super crowded, the waiters will be very difficult to flag down so when you sit down, look at the menu, agree on what you'd want and just order everything at once. Side note: it's be a plus if you spoke French and you'll get some bonus points for attempting it if you're a non-Québécois.

They were good at their job and I am sure that they get asked 1000 times a day on what to order especially since everything is in French. They suggested a medium smoked meat sandwich, fries, pickle and a black cherry soda. 

I must say that I liked the smoked meat better than salt beef (sorry London). The best way to eat one of these is ""medium"" (with a bit of fat) and fresh cut.

However, I do want to express a major concern I had with this establishment being cash only. I was visiting from out of town and had not exchanged any money as most of Montreal is very debit\/credit card friendly. One of the men behind the counter told me to use the ATM machine inside the establishment, which is in the back near the bathroom. I checked the machine for a skimmer and it seemed pretty legit. I used my card, withdrew cash to pay with no problems. However yesterday (about three weeks after my visit) I received a call from my Bank letting me know my debit card information was stolen from an ATM I used while traveling in Montreal. That ATM was the only ATM I ever used during my time abroad. 

It's a bit concerning that the only ATM available in an establishment frequented by tourists is compromised. I highly recommend the staff get this sorted out.

All that said, my take away is that this place is frankly a lot of hype at the end of the day. The sandwich looks packed with smoked meat (Montreal's contribution to cured meats) but if you look carefully, it is mostly an optical illusion as the bread is seriously small. Whatever. The meat is delicious, and I would have wanted more fat but my waiter didn't give me that option. After I ordered I heard another guy ask for it and I was like, dang! So if you go, make sure to ask for the fatty cut for more flavor. If you are counting calories, what the hell are you doing here anyway?! The fries are a definite meh, and the pickle tasted weird. We noticed this at a few places in Montreal, so maybe it's a local thing, but their pickles have an odd aftertaste of sweet that fades into a cheap vinegar, like white vinegar flavor. I am used to hearty garlic German pickles, so maybe that's my problem, but I couldn't even finish it as it tasted of urine (sorry!)

It's not the best deli I've ever been to, but it was much better than the other smoked meat I had in Montreal. Since this does seem to have a big tourist crowd, I suggest to fellow tourists that you just go to the take-out side and bring your sandwich a few block to the edge of Mont Royal Park.

I was wandering around my hotel looking for a place to eat for dinner and saw a huge line outside this place. I decided to stand in line to see what the commotion is all about. 

Initial reaction: This place reminds me of an old school restaurant you see in movies. This place has been around for nearly 80 years. The dining area is brightly lighted and pictures and newspaper clippings covered the wall. There's even a counter for solo eaters like me to eat. I ended up talking to a guy next to me and now we're friends. According to the staff they have hooked up two couples this month! Overall a very lively experience.

What I ordered: The guy next to me recommended me to try their smoked meat sandwich and get the pickle. Normally, I am really critical of sandwiches because they all taste the same to me. 

Time to order to time served: Food came out quite quickly (should've take that long since it's only a sandwich right?) even with a packed house and people waiting for a table outside. 

Food: I can see why there's a huge line outside. The sandwich itself is packed with meat and it was delicious. The fact that I was hungry made the sandwich taste even better. As stated before, I'm not much of a sandwich person and this is good. Wash it down with a soda and some fries and it's a winning formula.  

Bathroom: Didn't get to use it so I cannot comment. 

Customer Service: The customer service was very straight forward and aggressive but still in a friendly way. I did not feel unwelcomed or rushed even though I was a bit dazed with all that commotion when I first walked in.  

Would I eat there again: Yes, I will eat there again even though I'm not a sandwich and to me that's a pretty big deal. This place is not that cheap. For a smoked meat sandwich, fries, pickle, soda was about 13 dollars.",0,0,0

Sure, they're not cheap and their might be better Montreal smoked meat out there - but this place is great and a real institution. While I've never done it myself, those pressed for time might consider the take out option and picnic nearby - weather permitting. 
Over-hyped? Perhaps, but the staff is always friendly, the food consistently good and places like Schwartz's seem to be disappearing so I plan to continue to visit every time I get the chance!",1,1,2

It's crowded all the time and you have to wait in line outside for the surly wait person to come out and check the line for a party of your size. It looks like they have spent $0 ever for renovation. There is a window in front with a pile of whatever they've recently cooked. Usuallly, a pile of beef briskets, tied in string. Last night it was a
Pile of smoked chickens very unglamourously dumped. Of course, they don't stay here long, so why make an elegant pile? When you do get inside, you have very few choices to make on the limited menu. It is crowded and noisy and you need to be ready to order as you sit down. 

This is all, OK! It's part of the Schwartz's shtick. 

The simple thing to do, then, is immediately order a brisket sandwich and a pickle. I'd also get some fries (frites) which are pretty good. Here is the big hint - get the FATTY brisket in your sandwich. They have three settings: lean (=meat cardboard anywhere including here), medium (what I had mistakenly ordered in the past = just OK), and fatty (= the one that is unmatched and unbeatable). So moist and tender and flavorful. Fatty. Remember that. 

No beer here. Just water, soft drinks and such. In a way, it's brilliant because with the simple menu and inventory, they can serve you within five minutes even with all he crowd all the time. My chum from work (we are here for a convention) thought it was totally great too.",1,0,2

We arrived a little after 10am on Thanksgiving day. Walked in and was seated immediately by a man behind the counter. After we sat down, the only waiter in the entire restaurant came by and wanted to take our orders. I asked if I could get a menu because I'm not aware or sure of how to order and exactly what to order. The man rudely said and I quote ""there is no menu, we only have smoked meat and we're very well known for that"" and he proceeds to point to their wall covered in newspaper clippings of their restaurant. 

We were already turned off by the rude comment. But we insisted on having smoked meat for brunch. We settled for two Montreal smoked meat sandwiches. These sandwiches were gigantic and beautiful. They are what heaven is made of, i'm sure of it. Fresh bread spread with mustard and filled with so much Montreal Smoked Meat that you totally forget about the bad service. Each bite reminded me that I was closer and closer to finishing my sandwich and that i should probably pace myself. But it was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD. Before you knew it, i gobbled up my sandwich in about 10 minutes.

The restaurant has been open since 1928, and the history shows when you're finally able to get a seat inside. The long, thin interior coupled with the restaurant's popularity makes for a very busy establishment. No matter how you slice it, you're going to have to get friendly with those around you.
The sandwiches are basic, and exactly what's you'd expect. You'll get an unreasonable amount of smoked brisket, between thin rye bread slices, with a spread of regular yellow mustard. The folks at Schwatz's obviously know not to mess with what's not broken, and serve you up a simple sandwich that people have lined up for for years. All that being said, history alone does not make a knock-your-socks-off sandwich. If we're being honest, these sandwiches are pretty dry. I definitely suggest giving yourself a squeeze of yellow mustard for dipping, and having a glass of water at the ready.

The smoked meat sandwiches are superior to the sandwiches at infamous NY delis, such as Katz's, 2nd Ave and Carnegie. Yes I said it.

But man....it tasted so good.  Juicy and hot - the 2 things I like best in my meat :)   Keeping things simple always is a plus in my books.   I really can't describe in words this place - you just need to come here and try if for yourself.  We did see they had poutine and were tempted to try it but it was late at night and we had already eaten dinner before so we stuck with the classic sandwich.  

The place itself looks like a worn out diner, but in a good way.  The menu is simple, the prices are decent and the service is fast.   Order and then pay at the front.",1,1,1

We ordered a side of fries to share and of course, a pickle. In terms of the smoked meat, wow was it ever dry. Now, I understand that I ordered mine lean and some dryness is to be expected, but I've had lean smoked meat before that was nowhere near as dry. It was also thicker than I'm used to but I'm OK with that. In terms of flavor, I really enjoyed it - but the dessert-dry feel didn't work for me.

The smoked meat sandwich was bland. Just a big pile of bland and old meat, which had clearly been reheated and was now dry and stringy. The fries were, actually, pretty good. The cherry soda, also pretty good in combination with the other things. But in the end it was not worth it.

The uncomfortable part started when we sat down and the guy behind the counter asked us where we were from. My friend is from Vietnam, and once the counter guy heard that he started going off on how ""I bet you're from south Vietnam"" and talking about how he knows the whole story, and basically recounting a poor History Channel summary of the Vietnam War from some documentary he watched. Thanks, but my friend already knows. Then he mentioned something about Asians taking jobs, and wouldn't stop talking about Vietnam until I completely changed the subject.

While we were waiting for the check I hear one of the guys brag about how he just scammed the guy sitting next to us out of 10 dollars by saying he ""didn't have any change"" and then he pressured us into giving him a higher tip too. We just wanted to leave at that point.

To start off, Schwartz is quite small and has that old diner feel to it. Even though it's small, their sandwiches are definitely not small! My friends and I ordered the Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich, poutine, and the black cherry drink. The poutine was alright, just tasted like normal poutine, but the Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich was absolutely amazing! There was so much meat stacked in the sandwich and mustard on the bread complimented the meat nicely.

Also, beside Schwartz, they had a ""take out"" Schwartz store that let you buy the meat to make your own sandwiches at home! My friends and I bought some of the packed meat to take home. The coolest part of this was that there was a tac board filled with napkins pinned on it with people writing comments about where they're from and what they thought of Schwartz!

However, going to Montreal at least once a year exclusively to eat at Schwartz's and pick up a dozen dozen bagels is something I take very seriously. 

There are really only two things you'd want to get here and that isn't because the rest of the menu is poor, I'm sure it not, it's merely for the fact that the smoked meat is just that good. 

If you're a sandwich lover (and if you're not, we're just not going to get along, don't bother contacting me in any way) order the medium fat smoked meat sandwich with fries and a pickle. If that doesn't sound like enough food for you it is, but if you don't trust me go ahead and order the coleslaw as well. It's average. But don't worry, you won't need to eat more than a forkful of it anyway.

The smoked meat sandwich however, is anything but average. We're talking about a mountain of thick cut, beautifully marbled brisket piled between rye bread and some appropriately plain yellow mustard. There's usually enough meat on each sandwich that you'll want to take a bit off and eat it with a fork and knife but even if you think you can open your mouth wide enough keep the fork as some of the meat is guaranteed to fall out. One bite and you'll realise what the 80 year old hype is all about. This is meat like no other. MUST be tasted.

The fries are a nice compliment and the pickle is enormous and juicy as a mofo. Not crunchy like you'd expect but definitely one of the better pickles I've eaten (though I hear good things about the Moshies pickle just up the street). 

If you're on the Atkin's diet, I'd suggest the smoked meat plate which is literally a plate of the smoked meat. That's too decadent even for me. It's common for people to order a loaf of rye bread with this and just build there own sandwiches, in fact, the last time I was there I saw a dude polish off 3-4 handmade sandwiches in less time than it took me to get through my sandwich. Fat ass. 

One thing you can definitely expect is a wait. Located on St Laurent in the Plateau, you can expect a 10-40 minute wait. The lineup is certainly part of the Schwartz's experience and even though I hate waiting, I love the fact that they haven't caved and moved locations - there's something special about that spot. Once you get inside, expect to be rushed to a table, where you're likely to sit with strangers if you're a twosome. But don't worry about making awkward conversation, it's understandable that no one could talk with that much meat in their mouth.

The servers are attentive but somewhat impatient. I feel as though part of that comes from the fact that if you're from out of town you should really just be ordering the smoked meat and if you're a local you already know to get the smoked meat. The other part? They're French. Ehyo!

If you are from out of town do yourself a favour and spend the $50 on a brisket to go. It won't be the same, but it'll still be the best thing you eat that week. Wish I had some in my freezer right now. I guess it's time to go back.",3,2,2

I also have mixed feelings about the staff. One woman, while polite once we got her attention, was completely oblivious to us, her face buried in her phone.

Of course we had to try it, and we had envisions of some kind of unique, delicacy only found in Montreal. 

We arrived a bit before noon and a line was already forming. However, it went quickly and we were seated at a table with other patrons (super small place and utilitarian in style). We quickly realized this  was a Jewish deli serving up what is akin to a corned beef sandwich on rye, which was decent, but I wasn't as enamored as the locals. Maybe having had great corned beef sandwiches in New York and Miami have spoiled me. The service was great, though, they don't rush you, and they let you choose the level of fat\/leanness you want in the meat.",0,0,0

When you're standing in front of the joint, you'll find yourself asking if it's worth the wait. Don't be discouraged though, the line is most likely for the sit down side of Schwartz's. That's how we felt until we found the line to the take out\/away which was much shorter and quite fast. The menu is simplified to the max. Three types of sandwiches, poutines, and pickles. All you need is their infamous smoked meat sandwich (first one on the sign, about $10 CAD). The other two sandwiches I can recall is turkey and pastrami. 

The line probably took us about 10-15 minutes and we got the food the second we placed the order. It's not prepackaged, they just have guys continuously pumping them out. That's why the menu for the take out side of the house is very minimal. We grabbed a few of their #1 smoked meat sandwiches and headed across the street to hang out like hoodlums and enjoy the feast. Trust me, we weren't the only ones doing this. 

The smoked meat is super tender and not too salty. I wished they had grey poupon available! The sandwich comes with a little mustard but I would suggest adding a little more to spruce up all that meat that is going into your mouth. That's all the sandwich really is; soft white bread, tons of meat, and a dab of mustard. Sounds boring, right? But really it's not. Initially it's like meh but then it leaves you with a lasting impression that comes out of nowhere. We even had this after a full blown meal nearby. I will say, one order for a single person will definitely put you in a coma.

If ever in Montreal, don't pass this up especially if you're not a local like myself. It's an one time deal until you come back on another trip. They've been in business since about 1928; it's practically an iconic landmark. The dine in line sucks but just opt for the take out line and eat it elsewhere. You'll be on your way to the next eating adventure in under 30 minutes.

So the deduction of the star comes from their fame and long lines with no adaption. I know the reason is not due to revenue shortage cause this place is packed all day long. Open a second location or expand! It's simple business practice. You may not want to grow but your customers do so open that other location and donate all the proceeds to the mass of homeless if you don't want the money.

Meanwhile, we don't have the around the corner, long lines that Schwartz's has, possibly because the above locations are much larger. Even with the massive hype Schwartz's gets via TV, social media, etc, it's not overblown. The smoked meat (or corned beef as many of us call it) it that good. It belongs amongst the best in North America, almost as good as Katz in NYC and at par with Harold's in Jersey, Caplansky's in Toronto and way better than Dunn's. 

Coming to Schwartz's isn't normally a quick stop. There always seems to be a crowd here. Patience is a must and if you are big into delis it's worth the wait, even though sometimes it's well over an hour. Think of it as an adventure and enjoy it.

I think the sandwiches are great tasting, the place is a little crowded, but that doesn't throw off the purpose of the deli, it's got great food, who cares about the so called crappy service.

The line outside of Schwart's is for the small dine-in section of the main deli.  The building on the left has the same awning and is the take-out deli. The line inside is short and moves VERY rapidly as most people are purchasing packaged meat or smoked meat (aka pastrami) sandwiches to go.  A few people (like us) will notice that there are a few stools in the back of this deli against some counters for eating.  Short line and a place to sit?  Plus a restroom to wash hands afterwards?  Win-win!

My friend and I originally waited in the main line on a Sunday afternoon along with other tourists and then realized there was another door.  We went in, bought our smoked meat sandwiches ($9.60), cherry soda ($2.35), and poutine with smoked meats ($9.45), and sat in the back to enjoy Montreal's top pastrami sandwich.  In less than 10 minutes.

The sandwich looked pretty small when wrapped but once revealed, we were shocked at the amount of meat they stuffed between two small slices of bread.  (We should have just gotten 1 to share instead of 2.)  They also managed to squeeze in some yellow mustard.  Two people can definitely share one sandwich.  The poutine was rich and heavy, as expected.  It was so much food that we brought the poutine back to reheat for breakfast the next morning.

Unfortunately, the sandwich was more on the dry and salty side.  They got the smoky taste down but it's not as good as the pastrami in Katz's Deli back home (NYC).  

I loved the cork board in the back and all the love notes that people write on their paper napkins.  They're pretty fun to read as they are written in various languages, including pictures and stick figures.",1,1,1

This place was out-of-this world delicious. I'm super glad we got there at an odd-moment where we were seated right away.

It seemed like the second we sat down, a giant line formed at the door that wrapped around the block. Apparently it's like this often.

Service is really slow but I think that's because they make these sandwiches with lots of love. Or at least, lots of smoked meat, and I guess that's hard to cut or something.

Either way, you sit communal and we were stuck next to a whiny couple who kept complaining that other people got their smoked meat even though they came in after the couple. They were whiny, but we were determined to stick through the inequitable service if we had to.

We split a small smoked meat sandwich with medium fat (you get to tell them lean, medium or Roseanne Bar circa 1980 level of fatness).  I thought the fattiness was perfect but my girlfriend wishes we went lean.

The rye bread is delcious, the cole slaw was tasty but overpriced and we ate every centimeter (I'm using metric cause we're in Canada) of the sandwich and then proceeded to lick our plates. 

The meat was delicious and super-seasoned, it's much dryer than the corned beef and pastrami I'd had in the states. I liked this but I understand others liking the moist stuff ""south of the border.""  (that sounded really gross).

Well, any smart local scoffs (or laughs) at the massive line of people in front of Schwartz's. There are enough solid smoked meat joints in the city that lining up for more than 5-10 minutes seems absurd.

Combine the ridiculous line with the fact that both the atmosphere and service sucks, doesn't make for a place I yearn for (if you like blinding fluorescent lighting and being pushed out the door before you've finished eating, you might like it though).

SMOKED MEAT. do not get the smoked meat plate for two people. three people, that would work. for two, it's a lot and getting individual sandwiches is CHEAPER. they serve fresh sliced bread with it. 

FRIES. do not get the fries. if you think you can knock out to local food groups (poutine) keep looking. they don't have it here. save the room for the meat plate you just ordered despite my recommendation.

PICKLES. definitely get a pickle but be warned, it's a la carte and not cheap. 

SODA. definitely get the cott cherry soda. there's something about it that enhances everything else.

I turned up around 11:30 and was amazed there wasn't a line. Inside was plenty busy, but there were a few tables still open and seating at the counter. I squeezed into a seat here, between two gentlemen, and stared in amazement at the mountains of smoked meat waiting to be sliced for sandwiches--we're talking kilos and kilos of beef encrusted in Schwartz's special spices.

""Parlez-vous Anglais?"" I asked the gentleman on my left. ""Yes,"" was the reply in a suspiciously American accent. I then asked if the counter guy would come back to take my order, or if there was some arcane process that wasn't obvious. He said the guy would be back to take my order and we struck up a conversation. It turns out Tim was originally from Dallas, but had been living in Montreal for about 17 years. He was already halfway through his lunch of a medium-fat smoked meat sandwich and fries. He recommended I also order the medium-fat, as the lean is too dry and some don't like the full-fat version. I followed Tim's suggestion and ordered a med-fat.

When it arrived, the sandwich was a little smaller than I'd anticipated. But then I had to remind myself I wasn't in the good ol' mega-sized U.S. of A. anymore--and it was too big for me to finish anyway. The smoked meat was piled thick between two slices of a white-type bread (not sourdough, and not rye) and garnished with a bit of plain yellow mustard. The meat tasted like corned beef but not as salty, and there was just a hint of smoke to it. Tim said that he's not really sure why it's called smoked meat, because it's primarily steamed. Regardless, it was good, but I think I would have preferred the full-fat cuts. I noticed that by the time I was nearing the end of my meal, the meat had cooled and had definitely become a bit dry.

So, I'm glad I made it to this shrine to smoked meats, but I think once was enough to satisfy my curiosity. And my arteries thank me.",7,7,6

Maybe of the high expectations.. I was not impressed with my Smoked Meat Sandwich Medium Fat ($6.15)... it definitely not tender or moist as expected...blame it on the lean meat?

2nd order of Extra Fat was just a little better.. I am not convinced... this is decent but not good... and why am I eating a EXTRA FAT Smoked Meat Sandwich?! I thought I am on and on going diet!! And it was funny to see the reaction of the staffs when I placed my order!

I secretly have to admit that Katz's in NYC is much better, but Schwartz's pricing definitely more down to earth!

Turns out it's Smoked Meat sandwich, dill pickle, french fries, and cherry coke. A lot of food!
The sandwich is just... perfect. So simple but ... so good! When it started being a bit dry their fries and pickle helped. Fries... were the kind of magic fries that are amazing even if soggy... I gather prob due to extra amount of grease? I did not want to know but I ate every last scrap because that fry was EXZCELLENT~ Pickle was good but at $2 CAD... Well. Cherry coke is a MUST with this meal. 

One downside was that I found out later that this is all cash and I obviously hadn't even calculated the total upon ordering! I was $5 short in CAD, but cashier allowed me to pay the rest in USD, which they penalize you a bit against the CAD.

Schwartz's is thankfully the latter.

I'm going into snob mode for this, in order to compel those who are on the fence about whether they should come here or not, to do so.  You absolutely must, since this is one culinary experience I think everyone should have before they die.

First off, if you're going to fret about calories or healthiness, don't bother reading beyond this point, and don't bother eating here.

Second, know that the meat here is so good, all other regular restaurant rating criteria considerations are rescinded.  Do not let the lack of fancy decor, the occasionally less than personal (but often awesome, and never rude) service, the long line-ups, or the cramped, shared tables prevent you from eating here.

So, what you should do:

- If you haven't had anything here before, get the smoked meat (bread - optional, fries - optional, black cherry or diet black cherry cola or beverage of choice - optional, it won't matter what you have with this, anything good winds up complementing the meat, anything bad throws it's awesomeness further into relief).

- Order it only one of the following ways:  medium-fatty, fatty, or, as I usually request, super-extra-fatty (i.e. give me a bit of meat with my fat!).  Do not let health concerns get in the way of this, do not let peer pressure or shame get in the way of this, do not let armed killer robots get in the way of this.  The fat literally melts in your mouth.  You WILL have the tastiest liquid fat known to man dripping into the bread, onto your hands, down your chin, into your shirt...

- Bring cash, and come on off hours, in the middle of the afternoon or as soon as they open, lest you die as the heavenly smell fills you to bursting while you wait in the interminable line.  Don't bring weapons, because you'll use them, and then you'll go to prison, and the only way you'll be able to eat here again is to sell your body to someone to smuggle it in for you.

- By all means, get take-out if you don't want to eat there (again, where you eat it does not make any difference, in the restaurant, at home, in the street, meandering through rush hour traffic), but if you do, order it from the restaurant proper, not the special ""Take-out"" side next door, it's not going to be the same unless you take it home and plunk it into a professional steamer for six hours.

- When weighing this review against others, note that anyone who hasn't given Schwartz's five stars invariably doesn't know how to spell - how much can you trust someone who is so stupid they either don't realize they're doing anything wrong, or they do and don't know how to run something through a grammar\/spell-checker?  I poop on them and their lack of any semblance of taste, as should you.

- If you don't live near, do feel free to buy entire briskets to bring home with you, and invest in a large professional steamer so you can enjoy the meat as it was intended to be eaten.

Which becomes a topic of interest with my friends whom are trying it for the first time as well.

The meat comes in three options: lean, medium, and fat. As I've ordered medium, the amount of fat provided made the meats tenderness just right, juicy enough to not feel guilty and also tasty enough to feel enlightened.

Eagle eyed Yelpers may even remember that it was in my profile pic for the longest time!  And what's not to say about this storied Montreal deli that's not already been said: delicious, melt-in-your-mouth sandwiches that are cheap, filling, and will give any NY delicatessen a serious run for their money.

There's always a wait outside to get into this hole-in-the-wall of a restaurant, but once you brave the cold queue, you're packed into the seats one of the many communal tables.  You could order anything other than the smoked meat, but you'd be kidding yourself if you did.  It's a seriously amazing sandwich, and unlike its New York counterpart, not oversized to the point where you'd burst.  The fries are good too: not too greasy and a great complement to the sandwich.  Bonus points also for a pretty healthy-tasting cole slaw (little mayo).

One can't wonder, with the press clippings lining the walls, the posters advertising ""Schwartz's: The Musical"", and the paraphernalia for sale, if Schwartz's had indeed ""jumped the shark"" and ventured its way into tourist trap territory.  Judging from the overwhelming amount of English I heard throughout the restaurant, I'd venture to say that Schwartz's may be more popular with tourists and out-of-towners than the locals.

This is the kind of place where people go just because it is popular and then when they actually try it, they feel like they HAVE to say they like it.

Smoked meat can be very flavourful if it's prepared properly.

That's what you taste: Mustard and bland dry meat. Get water ready unless you want to choke to death. Grocery store meat sandwiches are far better.

Service is -100 stars. I don't know if this is a French arrogance thing or Schwartz's own inflated ego.

We had some crepes. It was down to our last dinner in town so we asked the concierge, ""If there was one place you'd say we HAD to try before heading back to the States, where would it be?""

With little to no hesitation, he said:
SCHWARTZ.
And then he proceeded to warn it was not a ""classy place."" He explained the whole 'smoked meat' phenomenon, which sparked an entire cab ride of lewd jokes revolving around meat smoking. Ha - and the concierge was worried about classy.

It was refreshing to see this family owned and operated, bare bones shop serving solid platefuls of meat, classic french fries and giant deli pickles. There was absolutely no way I could finish my sandwich (I swear there must have been a pound of meat on there) and I left with a big, full-belied grin on my face.

I do love me some Jewish deli... so when I found it, I was excited. I've never had ""smoked"" meat, so to me, it was like a kid eating a mystery meat sandwich. Because of all the warnings of ""long lines"" and what not.... with the quickness, I hopped on the subway and bus with my bf from our hotel, 20 mins away. Turns out there was the street fair madness on Laurent, so our bus took a detour, and we got off a couple stops too late (damn you google maps!). Anyways, after getting off the bus stop, I literally ran like the wind to try to beat the so-called crowd. Many blocks later I saw the light at the end of the tunnel.... it was SCHWARTZ'S... bright orange. I ran some more (with my trailing bf). I ran to.... no line. 

Haha.... well, that was before I knew there was two Schwartz's next to each other. So I suppose the sit down place might have a wait, but there was also a tent of outdoor seating, which looked pretty full but no one was in line waiting. So we went inside to order 1 lb of smoked meat, cole slaw, and a turkey sandwich. There was actually plenty of seating in the back.

The anticipation... opened up the package to a mound of smoked meat. Poor cows. Toppled tons of pepper and mustard on it and voila... yummy. Meat overkill for sure, but couldn't waste the pound, each of us consuming half a pound of hefty meat. Thank god for no bread, or we wouldn't have been able to finish it! Mixed the coleslaw (vinegary) with the meat and made mini sandwiches sans bread. Saved the turkey sandwich for watching Phelps swim at the Olympic stadium.

Overall great meat. You can't get that stuff in NYC, so it did me good. Thank you Schwartz!",3,3,3

Montréal smoked meat is made by salting and curing brisket with spices and using some sort of delicious wizardry. We had heard that Schwartz's was an institution in Montréal and the frequent line down the street solidifies this claim. We were lucky enough to drive by on our way out of town and when we saw there was no line we decided to go for it.

We picked up a few sandwiches for the ride home and because of this we were able to skip dinner. This was our second encounter with this awesome creation; after having it under eggs and hollandaise at Restaurant l'avenue, we had to give it a shot in its most famous incarnation - on rye bread with house-made mustard. We are glad we were able to squeeze this into our trip and our mouths are watering thinking about it, so check 'em out!

If you check out Scwartz's on Yelp, you'll find the main complaints to be about long lines and limited space. So if you're impatient and\/or claustrophobic, don't try to go during lunch hours and get your grub to go!

You can also check out Scwartz's website, though there really is no need - get the smoked meat, the menu is irrelevant.

If you think smoked meat sounds similar to pastrami, we have no idea what the difference is - but the guy who wrote this article does, so read it if you're curious!

I had to remind myself how Montreal parking works... it's been a while since I've driven in the city.  You have to know your parking spot assigned number so you can enter it into the parking machine on the street.  You don't need to put the ticket on your dash, you just need to make sure you're entering the right spot assigned number in to the machine.

I didn't see any lines so this was good... it was about 4:45pm.  Walking into the place it was still packed.  There was a single stool at the bar so I ended up taking that spot which worked out since I was by myself.

The choice was simple... smoked meat sandwich!!!  If I didn't get the fries I probably could have eaten 2 sandwiches.  I did get the fries which are basically fries but they are good.  The black cherry Cott soda was a good compliment.  I'm trying to drink less pop these days but really it was a must to complete the trinity.  

This sandwich is spot on and this is one of the reasons why Montreal will always have one up on TO when it comes to food... IMO this one food item is one of the cornerstones of Montreal's food extravaganza.  If it's not their version of bagels, or pizza or steamies it's their smoked meat and this place serves the best I've had.  

I went to Katz in NYC but didn't get end up eating there.  We walked in and walked out pretty fast.  Why?  It felt like I was lining up for get on a Disney ride before the reservation system.  Thanks but no thanks... it was a long walk that day in the summer in lower Manhattan and although I can't compare what Schwartz's has compared to Katz's I probably won't ever have to.  Schwartz's was no nonsense, quick, no line up and I didn't have to feel like I needed a wristband to get into a club that had bottle service.

Schwartz's again = the best I've had in my life for Montreal smoke meat.  Carnegie Deli on 7th Ave in NYC so far is the best corned beef and pastrami I've had.  

Schwartz's prices also are not outrageous either.  Considering they serve a lot of sandwiches both eat in and take out their consistency of their quality has really no choice but to be what they are in order to garner the attention they deserve.  

I will have to now make this restaurant a must go place every time I go to Montreal now... I think I may go there again on the way out of town too!",8,4,6

The smoked meat was definitely melt-in-your mouth, juicy and full of flavor, but the indifferent service left a bad taste in our mouths. It was dinner time, and the guys behind the counter were evidently ""over"" the steady stream of tourists, and the lady ringing us up at the cash register acted like she was doing us a favor.

Service was sort of Meh, which is part of the reason I took off a star. But also, I found the place to be super cramped. In order to eat a sandwich this stuffed with meat, you need a little extra elbow room. Also, I wished they had hot mustard and saurkraut on the sandwich. I guess I would have been happier if I had brought the meat home and made a sandwich there, myself.

Think ""Katz's Delicatessen"" if you've been to New York. The interesting thing is listening to the Jewish workers speak french. We went on a Sunday morning at 10:30am. No wait, not crowded - so what's the hype? My best friend and I ordered one smoked meat sandwich to share. I'm disappointed that you have to pay $1.50 for a pickle (from a jar!!!!) and $1.95 for some coleslaw. The sandwich costs $5.95 CAD or $5.36 USD and that's basically all you get. Two slices of bread and maybe a quarter pound of meat with some Heinz yellow mustard. 

The breakdown of each - the meat (Corned beef or pastrami I think) is really good. Tender with plenty of fat on the edges and you can see the cracked peppercorns. (Dieters be wary). The bread was pretty moist, not stale. We shared it and it was plenty enough for a share. The service is nothing to rave about at all, but seriously, you can tell right away as people just walk in and they're pretty much on their own. We ordered some meat to take home and the counter is pretty much no order, just get up there and cut people and order your meat at about $12.95 CAD \/ pound. That amount is worth it if you're not going to eat tons of it in one sitting. I took the cold cuts home and I'm eating about four slices a day and still have plenty left over. If I were to go back again, I'd pick up more meat at their take out counter but I'd avoid the sit down service. I did nab a bottle of Montreal steak spice for $4. Pricey, but hey, located on ""the Main"" everything will be pricey. You'll be amazed at how much Eastern European foodstuff you'll see on that street - Saint Laurent. My best suggestion, buy the meat - heat it up and pile it on Fairmont's ""all dressed"" bagel with a dash of dijon and deli mustard. That will do you good.  The meat will not come out the same - fluffy and moist, but still it has good flavor although a bit flat and dried at the ends upon reheat.

As I finish this review, I will be stuffing my mouth with more smoked meat.

Moist, tender, truly smoked, pinkish beef is piled high between the bread.  I came here a few hours after Boullion Bilk and was considering stealing a bite off my friends.  Luckily, the friendly waitstaff encouraged* me to get my own sandwich.

Line ups are abound year round, especially during the summer and long weekends.  Here's a tip: don't go in large groups, go as a couple or threesome, it allows you to skip the line faster.  

The smoked meat here is delicious, absolute heaven to taste into.  When you order your sandwich, ask for fatty meat for the most flavour, also order a side of coleslaw, pickles and a cherry pop to complete your Schwartz experience.

Schwartz's and the locals know that this place is popular.  The day before we visited while buying bagels at St-Viateur (another name you'll surely hear being held in high regard), the other patrons were raving about the length of the ""lineups"" in front of Schwartz's.  Schwartz's also realizes this, and in turn operates both a sit-down and carry-out side of their business, a major plus for moving the crowds through quickly.

The beef itself...pretty good.  If you're familiar with the corned beef, this has similar consistency, utilizing the same brine-curing process, but is actually kosher-style beef brisket.  Throw a bit of mustard on that and put it between 2 slices of bread, and that's all you need!  The amount of hype may have knocked it down a star, but if you go, you won't be disappointed.

se cas il est plus facile de trouver une place. A l'extérieur la queue peu atteindre 50m facilement de ce que
j'ai vu mais lorsque je suis venu (un peu en avance) il n'y avait que 10
personnes dehors. Une personne se charge a l'entrée de demander combien vous
êtes afin d'organiser au mieux ce qui permet des fois de se trouver a coté de
personnes que l'on ne connait pas du tout.

sa colocataire française qui venait d'arriver en PVT. Cela a été très utile
puisqu'au final je me suis laissé guider par le canadien quand au choix :
un sandwich, frite, une boisson et le fameux gros cornichon. Pour ce qui est du
sandwich il n'y a pas non plus un choix énorme puisque la boutique est
spécialisée dans la viande fumé qui est préparé le matin et qui marine pendant
8h ! Ceci dit la viande est vraiment délicieuse : elle fond dans la
bouche et elle a un gout vraiment fin. Je tiens à saluer la dextérité du
cuistot car il coupe ce jambon à une vitesse incroyable et sans y laisser un
bout de doigt ! L'ambiance dans le restaurant est un peu bruyante mais tout
va très vite et tout le monde parle avec tout le monde. J'ai bien discuté avec
mes voisin pendant se rapide repas et j'ai appris pleins de choses sur Montréal

That sandwich would easily be able to throw down with Katz's pastrami in terms of pure, smokey, beefy goodness with a little mustard. As I found out on wikipedia, montreal smoked meat is basically brisket, but it's different from pastrami in that more peppercorns and a lot less sugar are used. 

The craziest thing about this sandwich is that despite the overflowing, thick cuts of meat piled on your sandwich, it costs $6. six dollars?! Last time i checked, katz's pastrami sandwich was somewhere around $15. Even on a wet, snowy, December night, there was a line of about 10 people standing outside for their smoked meat fix.

The medium fat smoked meat was good, but maybe I was expecting planets to shift based on all the reviews I've read.  A good sandwich that I might eat on occasion if it was in my neighbourhood, but not something I would drive 6 hours to try (which I partially did).

The fat was probably the best tasting part...and the only reason I ate it (because I usually avoid it at all costs), is because removing it would have de-flavoured the sandwich.  

So, if you're a tourist like me, I guess you have to go because all your Facebook friends told you to go...but if you don't care much about peer pressure, then you might save your stomach for something tastier...like foie gras poutine?",1,1,1

Also, they can put the smoked meat on top of your poutine - but only in the takeout area. They do not do this in the sit in area. However, if you do sit in and want smoked meat on your poutine, if you're nice enough, have a nice smile, and speak to your server, they may accommodate.

He wanted to be sure I went and ""kvelled"" over a pastrami (smoked meat?) sandwich. While not an aficionado of most Jewish Deli despite my pedigree, I happily obliged him.

I understand why so many feel the urge to compare Schwartz's to Katz's in Manhattan, however, there is really no need because they are very different is scope and nationality.  Where Katz's gives a broad menu of many J Deli's most famous hits, Schwartz's has a much more limited menu that focuses primarily on their meat sandwiches.  They both have a ton of ethnic atmosphere, and for the People, it feels great to connect with another part of the lost tribes.  Otherwise, the food itself is excellently prepared with an almost Biblical recipe, and is quite tasty.  Certainly worth a trip if you are in Montreal and enjoy fat sandwiches. 

Otherwise, most North American cities have at least one old Jewish Deli that can satisfy your craving for smoked beef on rye.  Schwartz's up in Montreal is on that short list of great pastrami houses (Maison de Pastrami). 

Sooner of later, someone will put together a Yelp List of great P'rami joints and this one will be in the top 3.",2,1,3

To call it a ""tourist trap"" is ridiculous - for one thing, the prices are incredibly cheap even if though they could probably double them and still pack the place.  They could have opened a larger location or franchised it and made a bundle, but they didn't, because this place is authentic.  I guess it's not surprising that there is a hipster backlash, since there almost always is to anything good and popular.  

One word of advice would be to try to go during off-peak times, especially if you have a group larger than two.  I forget how late it's open, but I'd often head in late evenings or so and the place would be half empty.

We said ""he's 10 minutes out still but we'll order for him"" and to our shock the owner responded ""no you wont; if you order it for him and I bring it out when he's not here the food will get cold and I don't serve cold smoked sandwiches I want him to have the best"".  At first I thought ""this guy is crazy"" until I ultimately ordered my own smoked meat sandwich with a side of spicy peppers and a kosher dill pickle... and wow, they aren't kidding.

Ordering there, you can chose your meat cut as lean, medium, or fatty. For a full-on greasy spoon experience, get the fatty... but for myself\/and most ladies, it's a little too much to handle, so I'd recommend the medium.

Unfortunately, I wasn't.

Yes, the smoked meat at Schwartz's is pretty good.  Damn good, actually.  The rest of my experience was subpar at best.

Every time we drove by, the restaurant was full and there was a line out the door at least three parties deep.  That's always a good sign, but given that it was about 7 degrees outside, we opted to pass by each time.  But on our final day we spotted a second door next to the restaurant: ""Schwartz's To Go.""  So we parked and headed inside.

Inside was a takeout counter with some tables and chairs in back.  We took a number, waited in line, and placed our order.  Unfortunately, they were out of nearly everything on the menu, which was pretty limited to begin with (it was about 5:00 in the afternoon on a Saturday).  All they had was beef and turkey, so we got a beef sandwich, a turkey sandwich and fries.  Then we waited in another line to hand our receipt to the guys making sandwiches.  Then we waited in a third line to pick up the sandwiches.

Ravenously hungry, we dug into the fries as soon as we got in the car, but they were terrible; cold (it'd been less than 5 minutes since they were put in the bag), soggy and limp.  Very disappointing.

When we got back to the hotel and unwrapped the sandwiches, I was surprised at what I saw - two thin, soggy pieced of white bread surrounding about three inches of meat.  That was it.  So we dispensed of the soggy bread and dug right into the meat.  

THAT'S where the reward was - tender, juicy, BURSTING with flavor.  It was pretty awesome.

In hindsight, I should have dispensed with the extras at Schwartz's and just bought the smoked meat by the pound.  Them I needed to visit Marche Atwater for some fresh bread and produce, and make myself a real sandwich.  THAT will be the plan next time.",4,1,2

However, when I try the smoked meat at Schwartz's, I was amazed by how juicy and flavorful it can be. I am now a believer of the Schwartz's smoked meat, not sure if it is the best out there, but definitely the best I've tried. I was so excited to buy some for home back in Toronto, but it is not the same as having it there (although it is still good)! So for those of you that tried ""take-out"" and about to jump into conclusion, please be mindful that the take-out clearly does not justify! Tips: order the fatty part of the smoked meat; it might not sound like a healthy idea but definitely a good idea once you take a bite!",0,0,0

This is the only place in Montreal that I enjoyed eating at and I'll have you know I tried a bunch of places there.

We didn't know about this place at all until some dude at a men's clothing store in a near by shopping mall next to the W recognized our funny accents and felt the need to give us the 411 on Montreal eating joints. He gave us other hints too, but too R-rated to share.

Well, he couldn't stop telling us about this place being the best smoked meat house in the world. Yes he said the world. He was even stating how famous people go there all the time. The latter bit of information was irrelevant to me, but when someone is willing to say it is the best in the world, you have to put it to the test.

The place is a small divey looking joint on St. Laurent street passed all the nightlife. There was a bit of a queue, with about a 20 minute wait. Once you get in you either sit in the 10 or show tables they have or sit at the counter next to where all the meat is cut. If I was alone or with just one other friend, we would have sat there, but there were four of us and we were going to do some gluttunous style damage (aka American overindulgence). 

The floors are greasy slipper, so they are covered with rubber mats to try to provide you some gripption as you walk. Don't let your clothes touch the ground lest they be drenched in smokey oils.

We are big eaters, so we ordered a couple brisket plates, a entree of sausage and a entree of liver. The latter two were just okay, but when the plate of juicy sliced brisket came, we were in heaven. 

You actually get to choose between a lean, medium and fatty cut. I would have defaulted to fatty, but that might have been a heartattack waiting to happen, so we opted for a minor stroke instead and got the medium. It was super juicy. The seasoning fantastic. 

Slap a piece of rye bread in between two slices of brisket with a touch of mustard and you've got a true man's meal. It was definitely not for the calorie conscious nor those on low sodium diets. But if you have to go, why not with a plate of brisket. 

I was so in love with this place, I got a t-shirt to go to commemorate my visit. This place is awesome. 

I can't say it's the best in the world, but seeing my world of smoked meats is small universe, its got my vote for now....",1,1,1

Donc... c'est sans trop d'enthousiasme que j'accorde 3 étoiles à cette "" institution "" montréalaise. Une note correcte, sans plus. Voici pourquoi :

Oui, la viande ici est bonne, mais ce n'est pas la meilleure que j'ai goutée. La viande maigre (il faut dire "" lean "" car certains serveurs anglophones feront semblant de ne pas vous comprendre) est trop sec, il faut donc commander la régulière pour vraiment gouter un bon sandwich. 

Pour le reste, Schwartz's est un petit resto à l'ambiance médiocre. À l'intérieur, tout dégage une odeur de gras et de friture. Les tables sont minuscules, les chaises inconfortables, le service est "" garoché "", l'ambiance est bruyante sans être vivante ou sympathique. On vous incite à manger vite et à déguerpir dès la facture arrivée à table. 

Ce que je trouve dommage, c'est de voir à chaque été cette longue file de touristes, un petit guide de Montréal à la main, attendant patiemment d'avoir une table. Triste oui, car malheureusement pour nous les montréalais, les guides tels que Lonely Planet (ou autres) imposent Schwartz's comme la porte d'entrée "" culinaire "" de Montréal, alors que bien d'autres restos méritent l'attention des touristes, qu'ils servent du smoke-meat ou non.

Je le dirais toujours à nos amis touristes : vous désirez manger un bon sandwich smoke-meat et vivre une vraie belle expérience de resto de quartier à la montréalaise ? Alors quitter cette longue file d'attente et rendez-vous chez Lester sur la rue Bernard. La viande est aussi bonne sinon meilleure et l'ambiance est franchement plus authentique. Vous avez une voiture et vous êtes prêts à sortir de Montréal ? Alors prenez l'autoroute 720 direct Ouest et roulez jusqu'à île Perrot (30 minutes sans embouteillage).  Une fois passé le pont de l'autoroute du souvenir après Ste-Anne de Bellevue, vous verrez un resto au toit rouge nommé Smoke-Meat Pete. Un autre endroit que je conseil fortement.",12,0,2

There was no way we were waiting in the freezing cold for a table to eat something like this. Although one of the nights we went late, around midnight, so we sat in the main restaurant because there was no line. Take-out closed by then anyway.

Seriously, this place does not muck about with their pastrami. When you approach a restaurant and they have a big bay window hugging the front door on both sides, and one of the bays has like twelve sheets of wax paper spread out in it, with two dozen crusty, smoked briskets of pastrami stacked on it like cord-wood, fogging up said window, you know you are about to enter a place where shit is going down. 

I went here for the first time a few summers ago, secure in the knowledge that the best pastrami sandwich could be had at one of handful of places known to me in my then home of New York city, and that the ultimate determining factor was just were you a Katz's guy, or a 2nd Ave Deli guy, or did you subscribe to something a bit more obscure in the outer boroughs. Schwartz's shattered that little fantasy world.

I'll put it to you this way, go look up Plato's parable of the cave, and that will describe to you my experience of eating a Schwartz's smoked meat sandwich for the first time.

So back to the story.  We got inside the door and were immediately whacked in the face by the aroma of briney, smokey, fatty bliss-ket of pastrami, and headed to a seat at the counter. There was no question that we needed smoked meat sandwiches (that's what they are called on the menu - possibly due to the francophone thing - not sure). Our counter service guy comes over and starts engaging us in french, which of course neither of us speaks, so we ask if he speaks english. ""sure thing. what'll you have folks?"" New York accent, and all. I'm not afraid to say that I kind of wanted to kiss this man on the mouth at this exact moment.

So we got two smoked meat sandwiches on rye, with mustard, split an order of fries (NY deli style as well) and washed the whole thing down with cokes. I mean, really now, this was an outstanding goddamn meal, and the whole thing right down to the cokes coming in cans with glasses of ice on the side, to the brown mustard and the wax paper between the sandwich and the plate just oozed North Eastern US Jewish Deli. 

This sandwich is superior to any I have had in America (not just NY, but come on, NY leads the rest of the US in Jewish comfort food hands down, and I'm a die hard Red Sox fan admitting that). I love Katz's high stacked, house smoked pastrami on rye, and I love the sandwich that Yonah Schimmel made famous on 2nd Ave, but this thing is lean and fatty in all the right ways, and smokey and briney in such an uncanny balance that I dare say, regardless of their location, these folks have the pastrami sandwich against which all others should be judged.

If you live in Montreal, or even just Quebec, you have no excuse for not eating here regularly (unless you're a vegan or something). If you are visiting Montreal, eat here at least twice, I'm serious, and then you may want to grab a sandwich to go for the ride back to the states or to BC. Any way you end up here, just make sure you end up here. You are missing out on something wonderful if you don't.",0,0,0

It was a cold, wet, damp day and I stood in line for 20-30 minutes and I hate line-ups but I was in Montreal and I had too pay homage. We eventually got in and were seated at the counter. The place is old and rickety and resembles a tomb, more than a shrine. But that is part of the charm and legend of Schwartz. Service is non-existent, you feel more like an interloper than a guest. Its like going to your new in-laws who wanted you too be a rich, jewish doctor, not a brown guy who writes Yelp reviews as a hobby. But too be fair the gentleman behind the counter was smiley and considerate. My wife and I ordered 2 medium smoked meats, a poutine and 2 cherry cokes, the classic. The poutine was terrible, the fries were far from crisp and had an al dente texture, which may be good for pasta but not so much for deep fried potatoes. I found the smoked meat too dry for my tastes but you don't get too stay in business for 80 years unless a lot of others do. But the cherry cola, that was the bomb!

As an aside if i do go back, ill ask for the fatty, not the medium next time. It might change the dryness of the meat. The plate looked like better value than the sandwich. Also i'd use the side entrance, located to the left of the main entrance and get take-out. No lines, no fuss, the same smoked meat to go, without the purgatory.

The place is small and popular, hence the long line. We came at 11pm on a friday night in whats probably the off tourist season so we had no wait. But the ambiance\/experience of eating in was nothing special to me (me having had the Jewish deli experience already, that is). So I'd take-out before I'd wait more than 15 mins myself. Don't be afraid to sit at the counter, though, as you'll have attentive service there; clearly the most animated server was stationed at the counter when we were there (our service was dull and lifeless). 

Its silly not to get a smoked meat sandwich of course. I didn't know about the cut\/leanness options and just got what they gave me. And it was great. I've been spoiled by Katz's pastrami. But Im sure this is the next best thing outside of NY delis. This is shreddier than pastrami, I should note. It really falls apart; so be prepared for that. And its a little less flavorful than NY pastrami; it doesnt have that dark, peppery crust as much. Despite what you see in the window. Still great. These are smaller and cheaper than NY's. Get your own; dont share it. A half sour completes the experience. Though this one had the light green color I like, it lacked salt. The cole slaw was more vinegary than Im used to, not mayo, and more finely shredded. It was good, if different.

The meat was ordinary, but a good amount.
The bread used is a sliced bread, which adds no flavor to the sandwich, other type would be a better choice, that way you taste more than meat (is still called a sandwich for a reason, otherwise would be meat only).

This place is always extremely busy, no matter winter or summer. There is always a wait, sometimes the lines are insane. 

This place is best known for their Montreal smoked meat. I have to say, the smoke meat is pretty good if you know how to order.  Most people usually order medium fat. But the best smoke meat is the fatty ones. My boyfriend and I usually order a large plate of montreal smoke meat alone and share it. There's a plate sharing fee of $1.75, I believe. This included a side of bread. This is nicely paired with cherry coke. But sometimes we get cream soda. 

We've also gotten a Montreal chicken. The chicken was ok but I don't feel like it's worth it because it's more expensive than the smoked meat. I like the smoke meat better 

We've also tried the pickle. The pickle is a little too salty for our liking.  Fries here are also okay but the Montreal smoke meat is the main show. 

Overall, I would recommend to at least try this place. I like it but some people don't.

The portion is good for one but we shared it out as there are simply too many places to eat for a tourist. The staff took our orders and he didn't sneer at us when we told him its sharing, the only time was when I told him I wanted a lean meat in my sandwich! He laughed and ask why Asian always wanted to eat something lean which he adamant says it will not taste good. He coaxed me into eating a medium-fat nature which he has succeeded. 

Indeed, u have to order either a lean or medium fat meat that are not too tough and drying out. I liked its smokey note and somewhat delicate but not entirely frail texture. The meat has a good balanced of smoked and natural meat flavour and less harsh in it's seasoning. The lightly toasted rye bread combines quite well, but I wish they could splatter more mustard sauce (seeds along) underneath my rye, anyway u can doubled it up since a bottle is made available on each table. HP sauce, tomato ketchup, salt and pepper is within reach if u need any of them. 

I had the cherry cott drink which some says are good. Sure enough, there wasn't traces of awful cough syrup hint in it though it says artificially flavored. But it's not an everyday occurrence, so why be bothered!

Though there was a line when we arrived, it moved quickly, and we shared a table with two other customers with no appreciable wait.  Our waiter was efficient and good-natured--no small feat given the hordes of people moving through there at all hours.

We got smoked meat sandwiches (medium-fat, following advice from just about everyone) with a pickle, cole slaw and fries.  The pickle was great; the coleslaw was sweet and sour and vinegary, in a style I like and associate with Eastern European countries like Hungary and the Czech Republic.  The rye bread on the sandwiches was fresh and tasty with just enough caraway. I appreciated the portion size--generous but not crazy a la Carnegie Deli. So far, so good.  Not so good? The fries, which were greasy and not remotely crispy.

As for the meat, well, Zabar's in NYC wins for me (their spicing is a little more complex and the meat is moister), and my husband maintains his loyalty to his favorite Cleveland smoked meat.  It's worth mentioning that what constitutes ""medium-fat"" is really the luck of the knife and which end of the meat your portion happens to come from.  My husband's sandwich had several pieces that were entirely fat, which felt a little excessive to both of us.  My sandwich was leaner, and in our opinion, tastier as a result. On the other hand, I do agree with others that ordering the sandwich ""lean"" would be a mistake--the meat is on the dry side already, and without a little fat along for the ride would lose much of its flavor. 

In short, Schwartz's for us was good but not great--definitely not up to the considerable hype.  If you've never encountered deli food before, it would be a fun experience, but for us, it just didn't hold up to the excellent deli sandwiches we've had elsewhere.",0,0,0

after many people recommended schwartz's, i did a little happy dance when i found out our hotel (hotel 10) was only a 10 minute walk away! gathered my friends and onwards we made the walk to schwartz's.

we were expecting to split a sandwich between 4 of us because we were thinking it would be the size of american sandwiches however, the portion sizes are perfect for 1 individual. we were a bit deterred after seeing the long line of people waiting to be seated but while walking with our heads hung low, we saw a little door for ""take out"" service. i did another happy dance when i saw there was a small seating section in the back! whoo hoo!

we were at schwartz's around 7pm and line was long but we must have hit the take out counter before it got super busy!  we split 2 smoked meat sandwiches and got 2 pickles. they do take card so don't worry if you don't have cash on hand.

a lot of people compare this to pastrami (and katz and carnegie deli in nyc) BUT i don't think you could really compare as the smoked meat was a much more tame taste.  not too salty and not slathered with mustard. the sandwich was actually quite the perfect size and pickles were just the amount of crunch and sourness.

First thing first - the staff is super friendly! And I don't think it was because we came in after 8 pm. No matter the server's age, young or older, each and every one of them was very nice, chatty and welcoming. Everyone is bi-lingual, and doesn't make you feel inferior if you ""ne parles pas Francais"". 

I sacrificed my vegetarian preferences, and ordered the famous smoked meat, along with half and sour pickles, and a side order of French fries, to share. All came very quickly, and I promptly bit into the sizable half of the smoked meat sandwich (aka pastrami), which was served on the freshest rye bread with a droop of mustard. The bread made a better impression on me than the meat: the latter was quite bland, though soft and well cooked. I added more mustard - nope, still not there. I toped it with the English brown sauce - nope, there's just something missing: flavor, spices!  I politely finished my half, pressing harder on the half sour pickles and fries. 

When our very friendly server asked how we enjoyed the meal, my husband honestly told him that it was not as good as the last time he ate there, about two weeks prior.  Well, not two minutes went by when a plate of freshly cut pastrami appeared in front of us, with the server saying THIS was the cut we should have had. Of course we had to partake, and, boy oh boy oh boy, THAT was phenomenal!  Juicy, flavorful, tasty, melt-in-your-mouth delicious! We polished that off so quickly, he brought more - all at no extra charge, simply to ensure the customers were satisfied with the meal, the service and the experience. The total bill was very reasonable, and,of course, we left a generous tip for the excellent service.

With the menu larger than anticipated but the object of our desire displayed prominently the order was placed and asking if we preferred ""fatty"" or ""medium"" I suggested he give us whatever was better and he said ""medium"" before turning to a younger man who prepped and wrapped the sandwich, grabbed a can of Canada Dry, and bagged it for us to pay another young man at the door - the whole interaction took perhaps five minutes before we emerged on the street.

Moving on to the sandwich - three quarters of a pound at least, if I were to guess - I have a little bit of trouble describing exactly what I ate because I really have no reference standard, but with a touch of mustard largely avoided and sampling both the brisket on its own and with the rye bread I have to say it was actually quite good - a supple mouth feel with big notes of smoke complimented by what I believe was mostly peppercorn and coriander plus a slight sweetness that worked nicely with the rye.

But let's not forget the star of the show - the smoked meat! Medium fatty is a good level of juiciness for me without overwhelming the flavor of the meat. It's well seasoned, tender, and probably the best in the city.",0,0,0

I'm vegetarian, but I will come here just for the decor, the ambiance, the chips and salade de chou. I usually hate cole slaw, but they have a very nice one here. Their chips taste very clean and fresh which is probably because they don't fry anything else in the oil. It is very different than a NY deli.

I think it will be very nice when they open up the take-out annex with another smoker. I hope it works out for them!",1,0,0

The guy working took my order and suggested a black cherry soda.  I told him no thanks, but he wasn't paying attention and promptly brought me one and poured it for me.  There goes your tip, man.

Sandwich was pretty good, and reasonably priced at $6.65.  (The unrequested soda was $2.10.) I'm not a huge smoked meat fan, but this is probably the best smoked meat sandwich I've had.  And this place is legendary, so how can you hate it?

+ They seat you, you order, finish the meal, then pay up front.
+ If you order smoked meat you get asked how much fatty meat you'd like (lean, medium, or real fatty). I got the medium but I may try the fatty if I get the chance to return.
+ The yelp photos are pretty spot on.
+ Smoked meat, coleslaw, & french fries were yummy.

So one Saturday evening i decided to join the masses and have my own say on it. 

The place: The establishment has two different sides a take out and sit in and if you are going there for the first time sit in is a must as the ambiance is half the experience. From the outside you can't see much except that there is always a lot of activity around it. There is meat that in the window and most of the other windows are steamed up probably from the meat sweats and excitement from people inside. This adds to the place as you cant really see inside. We went around 5 o clock and it was very busy however we were seated straight away. You could tell there was something special about this place as soon as you walk in. You might have to wait if you have group (4+) however they turn over the tables quite fast. 

Food: So like anyone going for the first time, I went for the classic smoked meat sandwich a dill pickle and fries. It came out within about 7 minutes maybe less. I went for the extra fatty version because you know ""When in Rome"". My eyes could not believe it when it came out, there was a substantial amount of meat with a small bit of mustard and two slices of bread however you have to realize when you come here that this place is about the meat. The taste was amazing, so flavorsome and juicy with every bite. Adding a bit of extra mustard can be useful as its quite heavy. You could tell that the meat has been aged for a very long time the meat was very tender. The dill pickle was good but probably not worth $2.10 for it. 

We finished our meal in about 10 minutes. The price in total was about 15 dollars. 

I would highly recommend this place especially if your only in Montreal for a weekend and your looking for a meat fix. Its one to remember.",0,0,0

Be aware that in spite of the Jewy name, Schwartz doesn't serve kosher smoked meat. I believe Reuben's deli does, but don't take my word for it.

My only criticism about Schwartz's is the fact that it's the epitome of a cash cow. There is no decor or ambience whatsoever, the management doesn't care, and they aren't about to do anything about it. The place is constantly packed, there's a lineup in the middle of winter, it's actually a fairly unpleasant affair.

That said, I honestly can't tell the difference between the smoked meat here and at Rueben's deli on st cath. I really appreciate Reuben's atmosphere, it's a very comfortable place to eat, and they offer the same food.

When all is said and done, Schwartz is a famous, historic joint. You eat there because everyone has eaten there. Because you're a good goy that does what you're told.

Well, my favorite smoked meat joint is Reuben's because they even make an effort to make their restaurant comfortable for their customers, so eat your heart out, Schwartz's, you phony non-kosher profiteers!",1,0,0

Tonight, I chose the infamous Schwartz's.

It is located north of downtown on a busy main street - you might miss either of the two entrances if it weren't for the line of people out in front waiting for a table.  Yes, this place is relatively small and always packed.  Don't fret though - most meals take less than 20 minutes and the guys who work the door are great at getting people in (and out).  Be prepared to sit elbow to elbow with other diners though.  I was seated at the counter, where I could watch the magic.

I am not sure of the age of this place, but it is staffed by young men who know their business.  The food speaks for itself, but the servers add a bit of ""flavor"" by being personable and highly efficient.  You can shout out that you need more water or your bill and someone will hear you and get to it.

Note that the menu is not big - basically it's meat and meat.  I saw plenty of people order steaks, with a side of meat and a side of sausage.  I would not recommend this place to vegetarians, although they do offer sides of fries, cole slaw and pickles (all of which I was happy to enjoy).  I had the standard fare that they are known for - Montreal smoked meat.  I know it is sacrilege for me to call it pastrami, but it is as close to a NYC pastrami sandwich as I've ever had.  The bread is fresh and cut to order.  The guy by the window cuts the meat and throws it over the bread, which has been mustarded (yes, I just made up a word).

Note that they don't have any alcohol (hence why people are in-n-out in less than 20 minutes?) just canned sodas and juice.  Try the Black Cherry Cola - it is a perfect combination with the above mentioned items I had

Similar to NYC's old school delis, Schwartz's has been making sandwiches for close to 100 years. The formula is the same: salted meats piled high, mustard, and bread. Perhaps I went on an off day but half the smoked meat sandwich was too dry (lean?), and the other half was perfect (fatty).

I got the smoked meat sandwich (medium fat), and it really didn't have much flavor, other than just tasting like a pile of meat. While tender, there was no real spice or seasoning coming through, and the smoking process interestingly didn't really enhance the flavor of the meat. The rye is good but doesn't really hold up to the meat, with the sandwich falling apart once you get about half-way through. The fries are an afterthought for the kitchen, lukewarm and more limp than crisp - don't bother.

What *is* impressive is how quickly they can turn customers here - I was seated at the counter and was in and out in less than 15 minutes, a veritable turnstile.

It comes with mustard on it and it's sandwiched between three slices of bread...that's how much meat they give you. That one sandwich is enough to completely fill a person up. Maybe that's why they sell the sandwich without any sides. I, however, always split a side of fries with my lunch mate. They're the perfect combination of crispy and soft, with just a little seasoning, but not too much. The employees in the take-out side move customers through the line quickly, too.

It cost about 10$ and it is a cash only establishment. However, when I did go to pay, I left a 2.25 tip and the cashier did say ""that's it?"" which i was a little weary and not happy about... How much more did the cashier expect on a 10$ meal?

You can find smoked meat at quite a few places in Montreal, but the rest are just fakers. No one can quite get the fat-to-meat ratio exactly right like Schwartz's! Slap on some mustard and eat it up, Joe!

Some things that others haven't mentioned:
-Service here, while generally good, can be hit or miss. Some servers aren't always pleased with some of the blatantly American tourists (""Whaddya mean y'all don't have hamburgers?"") and, honestly, I can't blame them. As long as you're not obnoxious, you should get decent service.
-The fries aren't always so good.
-The black cherry soda is called Cott's, and it appears to only be available in Montreal...you can't even find it in Quebec City. If you don't have one, you're missing the full experience at Schwartz's.
-Smoked meat is NOT the same as corned beef or pastrami! It is in a class by itself.
-Seating is sort of Darwinian, but that's part of the fun. If you're looking for private and sexy, you're missing the point and probably shouldn't even set foot in here in the first place. But if you are truly a gastronome of the highest caliber, mangez vous!",3,2,1

Really?  There was nothing great about the food nor the service. 

The experience.  I got here around 11:30pm and this place still had a line, but it was a pretty small line and the wait about 5 minutes.  We were on the take out line, because we wanted to just eat and go.  I came here with my wife and her 2 cousins from Montreal.  One cousin said that Schwartz deli tasted like school cafeteria lunch at best.  I was skeptical and didn't think it could be that bad.  I asked if my sandwich could be cut into 4s rather than 2s.  The person said he didn't have time for that because there's a line.  What line?? There was only one person behind me.  I thought that him cutting one additional time wasn't too much to ask for.  Ordering, paying, and picking up the food was very confusing.  Also this place is cash only.

The food.  So putting the above issues aside, I thought maybe the quality of the food would make up for the poor service.  We unwrapped the pastrami sandwich and it smelled gamey, and it actually tasted gamey. Strike one.  We asked for no mustard, because my wife and I don't like mustard.  Guess what?? There's mustard smeared generously inside the sandwich. Strike two.  

As mentioned above, confusing process in ordering, paying and picking up food, along with poor attitude from the staff in just cutting the sandwich one additional time, strike three and you're outta here.  I will never come here again nor recommend this place.  Even if there was no line and they were giving these sandwiches out for free.  Stay clear because this place was a big waste of time.

Just a note, I've been on cruises and Katz deli in New York City several times, so I think I know how pastrami is supposed to taste.  Schwartz deli falls short in all ways possible in taste and service.",6,8,6

I came back the next couple of days but was discouraged by the long line outside. What I found out though is the line is for the sit-in. They have a store beside them that does take-outs only and there is no line-up. Well, depending on the time you go, I guess, but it's not comparable to the dine in. 

When you order, you can ask for fatty, medium or lean meat. I got the medium fatty because to me, the fat makes it tastier. When I got the smoked sandwich, I thought it looked too small, but it was a satisfying amount. Also, I overheard the waiter that if you're buying a platter of meat, they charge extra dollar per person. That, or you all order your own stuff. I can understand why. They're a pretty small restaurant and they get a lot of people waiting to sit in.

Plus, they treat you right, with a simple deli professionalism that gets you fed quickly and gives you time to enjoy. The sides are perfect deli style, nothing's been re-imagined and fusioned and brought into the 21st century, this is the real thing, traditional, and perfect.

We were recommended this place as the ""go-to"" for Montreal smoked meat samiches. I've never been partial to Montreal smoked beef but after eating here I believe it's because no one does it right.

The place itself is a very narrow shop, very retro in an almost dingy way. The ceiling looks like it might sink in and collapse at any minute and you wonder if it's really all that safe to come in. We managed to snag a seat later in the night but boy was it packed and filled with people to the brim.

When the sandwiches come out, it's so simple you kinda have to do a double take to assure yourself that's it. Two plain looking pieces of bread smothered with yellow mustard spread apart by a heaping mountain of meat. At this point I'm like ""why even give me bread?"" I pull out a piece of beef and munch and OH MY GOD I SWEAR I HEARD THE ANGELS SING. The tenderness mixed with the smokiness mixed with all that hallelujah seasoning. You want to bathe in it. I hate it when smoking places stinge me in on the smoky flavour but this place delivers it.

The process is even more fantastic, and would explain the flavour. (Don't shoot me if I don't remember it to a tee.) The beef, I am told, is marinated for 13 days to age and let the flavors set, smoked for 10 hours (or something?), and steamed for 10 hours leading to the ungodly amount of tenderness, suppleness, and flavor.

But is it a culinary revelation that puts famous Jewish deli stalwarts like Katz's in NYC to shame?  Absolutely not.

I made a point of dining in the restaurant and got here at 10:30am on a weekday to ensure I don't get engulfed by the long lines.  Fortunately the restaurant was barely half full when I got in.  I sat down and made sure I had the full experience in hand.  I ordered their famous smoked meat sandwich and paired it with a plate of poutine and cole slaw.

The sandwich was fine.  To be honest, their meat felt a little dry, even thought it was still flavorful and a solid sandwich as a whole.  The poutine was also ok.  It wasn't the best poutine I had in Montreal by a stretch but it was still tasty and a pure artery-clogging experience.  The cole slaw was just average IMO.

Generally speaking if it wasn't for all the hype around this place, I would probably have more reasonable expectations.  But even if I strip out all of my preconceived notions, frankly speaking I still think a good smoked meat sandwich from Katz's or even Carnegie Deli (or even Junior's) in NYC is still a cut above simply because their meat is juicier and more flavorful.

There was a generous amount of the smoked meat, which tasted pretty much like corned beef, with slightly of an off-taste to it.  Not too much fat, but I was curious as I've heard that you can request the different levels of fat (that wasn't offered to us).  It would have been nice to have more rye bread slices, or the option to request some more.  There is a bottle mustard on the counter, though, for convenience sakes.  Service was friendly, when available; however, the guys behind the counter seemed more transfixed in socializing and not really tending to the patrons dining-in.

The sandwiches are definitely smaller, but also much cheaper (around only $6).  The rye bread doesn't have seeds.  The mustard is standard deli, not spicy.

Got to the spot around 10:30PM: the storefront is old school and we could see the line for take out through the glass door (note, I did do take out so I have no idea what the waitstaff service is actually like, but the place is tiny and there was an old guy who was very informal both directing take out line traffic\/in house dinning traffic while serving food). Very casual place with 1930's decor (pretty sure 90% of the interior has never been updated). For those of you who have been to Katz's in NY, very similar look and feel, just a lot smaller (also smells phenomenal, just as Katz's does).

You order your food at the counter and then turn around and walk 10 steps to pay the cashier (very inefficient, but I am sure they wanted to keep the feature from back in the day). The guy who takes orders isn't very helpful (no suggestions when you ask him what's good; seemed sort of annoyed that tourists impeded on his local spot area), but I ended up playing it safe and ordering the smoked meat sandwich. While I was waiting for my food, I was a bit worried that the meat wouldn't live up to my expectations: as soon as I walked in, I thought to compare the place to Katz's, so when I saw the meat slicer (Katz's only hand cuts their meat bc its so tender that it would fall apart in the meat slicer), I started to doubt.

No need! For a $7\/$8 sandwich, I thought this was great value; not the largest pastrami I ever had, but the taste was great (meat, rye bread, a little bit of mustard). The thing may not be oozing with juice, but the meat is moist and flavorful just the same. Each bite was delicious, with a little bit of variety (whether you get the peppery skin or the moist, center pieces with a tad of mustard).

you know this place has to be guud if the line is covering and blocking the window view\/entrance of the stores next to it.

The smoked meat here is aweeeesome. Not too smokey where its painful to eat, but cooked and smoked to the perfect tenderness. The cool thing about this place was that you were able to choose what kind of smoked meat you wanted. Your given an option of smoked meat with no fat, smoked meat with a little fat, or smoked meat with a lot of fat. Obviously...for me...gotta go for the smoked meat with LOTS OF FAT! Yah I know its not healthy for you...but for me: ITS WHERE ALL THE GUUDNESS AND FLAVORS ARE! 

We also ordered a side of french fries and dill pickles. The fries tasted like fries and the dill pickles tasted a bit different, but in a guud way. 

One of the highlights of this restaurant...the server kept on talking about this ""cherry soda."" He talked about it so much that I had to order one. THIS CHERRY SODA WAS SOOO AMAZING! It literally was the best cherry soda that Ive ever had! If Guinness Book of World Record had a category for best cherry soda in a can...it has to be the one that this restaurant has! ITS A MUST GET! Goes great with the smoked meat! This soda was sooo guuud that I bought another one TO-GO after the meal!

Anyways...service was fast and quick. The size of the restaurant was very small...so be ready to get cozy with some strangers. Vibe and environment was awesome...always filled with upbeat and energized people.

P.S. get the plate! who eats bread\/carbs anyways right? And plus...you get a free side of bread when you order the plate.

Schwartz's Deli is a venerable institution in Montreal, and it is all about smoked meat. Similar to New York style hot pastrami (not that shaved crap you get in most delis), but not as salty. Just full of rich, smoked flavor, perfect with some deli mustard and bread, and served in Montreal at Schwartz's since 1928. They must be doing something right!

There are other things on the menu here, of course, but I would pass on any other meats. I also had a grilled steak, and it paled in comparison. The usual accoutrements are available, including fries and cole slaw. 

But be prepared. This place is quite small and most of the time, packed to the rafters. At usual meal times, getting in here can be a contact sport. But it is organized chaos. The guys in here have been directing traffic here for a while (one of the newest team members has been there 8 years), so they will eventually take care of you.

And as a bonus to American visitors, they accept US$ (currently at par).

Everyone who knew about smoked meat advised me to go to Schwartz's. I did not know where it was located so I went on the hunt for this famous place. I asked around for directions and all of the Montreal people stated ""its just down that street make a left."" So after following these directions to Schwartz's, I finally arrived there 1 hour later. With that long and dreadful walk my appetite was at an all time high. Unfortunately I forgot that a couple of people mentioned that there is always a lineup. I would estimate that there were 23 people were in line. Being hungry and impatient we decided we would go into the other shop dedicated to takeout orders. Even going in there there was a line up of about a dozen people. 

So I decided in line that I would just go for the Medium Smoked Meat Sandwich, with a pickle, and a Cherry Cola. After all the wait I sat down with my sandwich and began endulging. The bread was a nice thin slice filled with a fat stack of tender smoked meat and mustard. Im not a big fan of mustard but in this sandwich it was perfect. It was 6-7 dollars for a decent size but excellent quality sandwich. I washed it down with the delicious cherry cola and was satisfied. I would have got another one if I didnt have to wait in line. I would definitely recommend this place if you come to Montreal. I would just suggest that you know where you are going before you go on a mile long walk.

Founded by a Jewish immigrant from Romania, Schwartz's is famous for  its amazing smoked meat sandwiches. The meat could possibly be described as a cross between corned beef and pastrami, but really it's in a genre of its own. 

Comparisons are often made to NYC's Katz's Deli, and there seems to be a bit of a meat rivalry between the two, which makes the experience that much more interesting. Personally, I think Schwartz's wins for flavor and juiceness, but the debate rages on. 

Like Katz's deli, the atmosphere at Schwartz's is chaotic, loud and crowded. And like Katz's, you stand in line first to yell out the order for your food, then wait among the crowded tables to be served. You can choose among three cuts of meat - fat, medium, and lean. Take the plunge and go for the medium or the fat. You didn't come here to eat healthily anyhow. And go with the Montreal tradition and get a black cherry soda and pickle to accompany your sandwich. 

The perfect place for a great nosh at a Montreal institution. People make pilgrimages to this legendary deli from around the world - if you're in town, its worth it to experience at least once, at least if just to weigh in on the great Katz vs. Schwartz debate.",2,2,2

It was the meal I had after my quasi-epic trek up and down Mont-Royal the woodsy way, thus I was prepared for some meat!

The ambience of the restaurant is tiny, grubby, cramped.. yet I couldn't imagine it any other way-- and I do admire the owners' refusals to commercialize the restaurant into a chain. The grubby atmosphere was actually oddly inviting. It was raining heavily the day I went, but there was still a sizable line (plus, it was dinnertime on a Saturday evening), and the wait was about twenty minutes.

I have to admit the wait IS worth it though. The meat was amazing, and nothing like I'd ever had before. The fries and bread were average, and I unfortunately didn't get the pickles.. but either way, the meat was.. indescribably good. I probably could have eaten it forever if I could. It's so hard to put into words that I won't even try-- one must experience it her\/himself. It probably isn't the most amazing meat in the world, but it IS pretty good.

The service, however, was questionable. Our waiter was courteous enough, but didn't have a very welcoming attitude, and one of my party got into a small argument with him about one of the fees-- though, nicely enough, he ended up not charging us the fee that we so contested. Still, the service was only okay.

While I must admit that Schwartz's IS a bit overrated.. it is worth going to at least once if you're in Montreal.

The food is good if you just want a meat sandwich with not a lot of fan-fair. They're known for making this smoked meat, and while it is good, it isn't something truly unforgettable. They give you a choice of lean, medium, and fatty brisket; which I like. I usually get the fatty brisket because I'm thin and in relatively good health.

I guess first off, I should mention that their food is really as good as other reviews claim it to be.  The meat literally melts in your mouth, fries are as good as they get and the pickle is what you would imagine the perfect pickle to be. 

All was good in da hood.  Service was initially very good.  But it all went downhill when my friend finished his can of Coke.  We waited until our waiter came around, then he asked ""Sir, could I have another can of Coke please?""  The waiter replied no problem, right away... then 5 minutes goes by.  Then 10.  Then 15.  20 minutes, and the dude does not come back with my buddy's Coke.  We were pretty sure he forgot by then, so when he came around again, my friend asked him for the Coke again (not rudely, but very politely as before).

Things started to go really sour from there... the guy started giving us the kind of screw face that only the old Eastern European dudes permanently carry around.  Then he muttered something in French, which we could kind of tell was an insult because the locals surrounding us started snickering.

Another 5 minuets passes by until the Coke finally arrives... slammed on top of the table.  WTF?  Why so much attitude buddy?

So by this time, we are pretty much done our meal.. we grab the can of Coke to go, and ask for the cheque.  Even though we waited 20 minutes for Coke, we receive this promptly.  The awesome part?  He followed by two finger taps on the table, with instructions to ""leave the tip here.""

Hahahaha!!  I could not believe this guy!  I've seen some guys with big balls, but this guy has the biggest balls of all time!  You want me to leave you tip?  I have never in my life had anyone ask for tip before.. never mind by someone who gave us kiss my ass service.  So after having a chuckle at his face, I grabbed the cheque and paid the cashier.

Then we hit the sidewalks and started walking to our cars... out of no where, we start hearing some angry French speaking dude yelling at us.  We turned around, and sure it enough it is Mr. Big Balls himself.  When he had caught up with us, he had a copy of the cheque in his hand, and was doing math to figure out how much we should tip him.

My friend and look at each other and started bursting out laughing.  We turned around and kept on walking, while LOLing non-stop... and of course, we heard lots of follow up French cursing from the angry man.

It's filled with classic delis that serve those iconic piled high sammies you need at least two sittings to finish. Apparently this is THE must stop for smoked meats and classic Jewish fare in the area. 

We arrived early in the morning and there was the start of a line. If you come before 10am they will not sell you hot meat and that was somewhat of a bummer for hubs as he was really looking forward to a Rueben not just a cold corned beef on not toasted rye. It was huge and priced appropriately for size. He said it was pretty good, not outstanding. I honestly think he was just disappointed that he wasn't able to get what he was really looking for. 

We also bought one of each of their mustards to bring home to family and house rub. All were absolutely incredible as was the single large kosher dill I couldn't resist. Definitely grab some bottles to go!!! When these are done, I'm calling to figure out how to get more. They're insanely delicious! Best mustard ever! 

I say give it a go but get there right at 10am to avoid long lines and if you want a hot sandwich.

After reading the reviews, we expected our lunchtime wait to be much longer than it was. We reached the front of the line relatively quickly, and were seated at a table with two couples. Both of us opted to order the smoked meat sandwich (in case you're wondering - that's pastrami) and sour pickles. It was some of the best pastrami I've ever had. The flavor and texture of the meat were perfect, and it had just the right amount of fat. The rye was flavorful. The pickle was hands down one of the best pickles I've ever eaten.

We had a large group, but we did not mind splitting up because yeah, smoked meat from Montreal is worth it.

Another fond childhood memory of my aunt bring us smoked meat once every few years. We HAD to have smoked meant and when in Rome (or Montreal), you want the best there is.

Schwartz's is GOOOOOOD. They are not stingy with the meat and they are spot on with the prices. I generally do not enjoy peppercorns, but they prepare the meat in such a way that they only add to the flavor.

I ordered my sammie with a black cherry coke, just as fellow Yelpers had advised. Normally, I'm a diet soda kinda gal... would rather save my calories for the main course. But today was a special day, and boy, that black cherry soda really topped off my sammie.

The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because my Canadian companions were not as thrilled as those of us from the States who had smoked meat on a pedestal since long before we crossed the border.",2,1,1

The meat is littered with black peppercorns, but the peppercorns are not too strong as to distract from the meat that has been cooked for hours.  The sandwich is filling. Noms.

Schwartz's has nothing to hide; simply pure good meat. 

Pure ingredients, and pride of tradition that has been round since 1928.

And a black cherry soda with your meat rocks.

The sandwich wasn't overwhelmingly large like Katz', it was actually lunch sandwich size, maybe a little large.

Also, it was only 7 bucks. Perfect amount for what you got. Very fair. Plus they took American money. Happy time!

I really wanted to like this place but it just fell short. 

Overall, the sandwich was just okay. Luckily I did not wait long to get seated, however, if the line were any longer I'd say it wouldn't be worth it. The flavor of the smoked meat was very tasty, it's less peppery than the American pastrami and more mild, which I liked. My one complaint about the meat is that it was sliced too thick which made it tougher to eat (I prefer thin sliced). The bread was pretty standard and a little too soft because it fell apart easily as I bit into the sandwich. I also highly recommend that you order the dill pickle or coleslaw (which is vinegar based) to accompany your sandwich to cut through the fattiness of the meat.

The highlight of our meal was the fast, efficient, and friendly service. Make sure you bring plenty of Canadian currency because this place is CASH ONLY. They will let you use American currency but you will be charged extra. I'm glad I got the chance to check this place out......but I probably will not be going back for more.",0,0,1

Pickles are one of my favorite foods, and I loved every second of the giant pickle I ordered. Paired with a coke and a side of fries, this was a pretty good lunch. 

I'm not one to complain about lines. If a place is delicious enough, I will wait up to an hour. I was in line for about 20 minutes, and I have to say if I came here again and I saw that line, I would probably decide not to go in. Not because it was bad, but just because I could probably find something else to suit my drunk cravings. 

It was very crowded but the selection was minimal, so I made a quick decision that I was happy with. The meat was drier than I was expecting, but still very tasty. Add dat mustard and you'll be good.

The atmosphere was deli-ish. I don't know how else to describe that. Be prepared to sit at a table with people you don't know.

My BFF and I were so infatuated with the smoked meat that we even bought a lb each to smuggle across the border (12.95 lb CAD). Sadly enough, it's just not the same after you make numerous attempts to revive the moistness and tenderness of the meat. It sorta just fell flatline.

I have a tendency to be a harsh reviewer when it comes to these types of meats because I've sampled very good pastrami\/ smoked meat in NYC. When I saw this place on television and heard from my friends about the place while researching in Montreal, I became excited to see what the hype was all about. 

Little education for novices--smoked meat is akin to the combination of pastrami and corned beef--having the rich fatty, peppered skin of pastrami, but the lean, tender texture of corned beef.

Somebody call my momma-- I was NOT disappointed at all. 

I encountered a long line when I strolled up to the restaurant but was not deterred.
This was the best food I had during my Montreal experience. The sandwich comes in three different options--lean, fatty, and medium (which is a combination of the two). I ordered a smoked meat sandwich, double fried french fries, and a 1\/2 sour pickle. This was awesome and satisfied the smoked meat fix that I developed after hearing about this place--fatty and lean, one bite melting the fat in your mouth. The fries were amazing as was the pickle. Wash it all down with a cherry coke ladies and gentleman-- its the perfect compliment to this meal.

I went back after and tries a lean sandwich for comparison and must say that the medium is definitely the way to go.

Here's a good hint--if you want to avoid the long lines, then come an hour before closing time. You will be served immediately BUT risk not receiving a fresher piece of smoked meat.

Thankfully, one of the best things about Schwartz's is that you can get yourself one of these bad boys at pretty much any time of day. So when I needed my midnight snack I knew I had to come here. 

Ok first of all I don't even like smoked meat. Except here, of course. Anywhere else I can't do it. So I ordered 2 medium smoked meat sandwiches, 2 turkey sandwiches and 2 half sours. Sadly they were out of half sours so I ordered a regular pickle.Despite there being a line (even at 12AM), the service was polite and efficient. Just a reminder, these guys are cash only, but theres an ATM in the back. For the 4 sandwiches+pickle it came to $36, pricey I guess, but totally worth it. I realized I forgot my cherry coke on the way out which was plain silly.

The meat was a bit dry. It wasn't moist and delicious like the first time I had it, perhaps because it was at night? Perhaps there was more fat on it the first time? Either way, it was still so huge it was nearly impossible to eat, and the amazing spices were all there so it still tasted great.  The pickle was also great, if you haven't had a pickle that isn't from a jar you bought at the grocery store, you need to. I don't know why they're so much better but they are. The turkey was also exceptionally good, but it was a cold cut, still it was seasoned wonderfully and also nearly impossible to eat like the smoked meat one. Also they threw in a few extra pickles for me! Yay

I read the reviews while I was standing on the long queue for seats in the restaurant side of the establishment. Some people said the meat was bland and tasteless, but after trying it myself I had to ask...where were they from and what do they usually eat?? 

The smoked meat was so tender and pretty flavorful, with just a bit of fat left on to make me swoon. I ate it plain without the bread or mustard and didn't feel it bland at all, maybe if you were comparing it to Southern American BBQ.

However, as part of my Schwartz combo, I also had a steak with my smoked meat. I asked for rare and it was no where near it.  It was so overcooked and completely bland. It's probably why they sprinkle even more of their signature rub mixture on it before they served it to me, this piece of meat needs all the help it can get in the flavor department. The combo also came with an hot dog sausage, not too memorable.

The sides were good though. The cole slaw was crisp and with just the right amount of vinegar, one of the best slaw I ever had. The large pickle was also just right. I devoured both.

Stick to the smoked meat, ask for cole slaw, pickles, and peppers. Try to pair off when waiting in line. The counter opens up much faster and it always has room for two or less.",0,0,1

Shawartz c'est un restaurant hébraïque qui est pris d'assaut le midi. Pour les pressé je vous conseil de passer votre chemin sauf si vous êtes seul car dans se cas il est plus facile de trouver une place.

A l'extérieur la queue peu atteindre 50m facilement de ce que j'ai vu mais lorsque je suis venu (un peu en avance) il n'y avait que 10 personnes dehors. Une personne se charge a l'entrée de demander combien vous êtes afin d'organiser au mieux ce qui permet des fois de se trouver a coté de personnes que l'on ne connait pas du tout.  En étant tout seul je me suis retrouvé au comptoir avec un Canadien et sa colocataire française qui venait d'arriver en PVT. Cela a été très utile puisqu'au final je me suis laissé guider par le canadien quand au choix : un sandwich, frite, une boisson et le fameux gros cornichon. Pour ce qui est du sandwich il n'y a pas non plus un choix énorme puisque la boutique est spécialisée dans la viande fumé qui est préparé le matin et qui marine pendant 8h ! Ceci dit la viande est vraiment délicieuse : elle fond dans la bouche et elle a un gout vraiment fin. Je tiens à saluer la dextérité du cuistot car il coupe ce jambon à une vitesse incroyable et sans y laisser un bout de doigt !

L'ambiance dans le restaurant est un peu bruyante mais tout va très vite et tout le monde parle avec tout le monde. J'ai bien discuté avec mes voisin pendant se rapide repas et j'ai appris pleins de choses sur Montréal et les endroits à faire.

This is simply the best place for smoked meat. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Some people seem to get steak, but I have no idea how they manage to resist the sandwiches. 

There will be a line. Just wait in it - you won't regret it. If you're getting it take-out, though, just head next door rather than waiting to get in to the main restaurant because they have all of the same food and it will be much faster.

There's nothing fancy about this place. If you're in a small group there's a pretty good chance you'll get sat at a table with people you don't know and there are no frills on the menu. It's crowded as heck, with the quintessential diner feel. But everyone is in a good mood because the food is so good and it's great fun to watch the guys behind the counter fooling around, yelling out orders and slinging out sandwiches. 

And that's what you should get, by the way. Medium (or maybe fattier, but medium's always been enough for me) smoked meat on rye, or a smoked meat platter with rye bread so that you can make multiple sandwiches. 

Be prepared to have a sandwich appear in front of you very quickly and for it to take a moment or two for you to figure out how to wrangle the huge pile of delicious meat for which two pieces of rye seem wholly inadequate to contain. Yes, you'll make a mess. Then you'll go fishing for all the little bits of meat you drop, lest they go to waste. I always order my sandwich with a dill pickle, even though I don't normally eat dill pickles. The acidity cuts the fat in the meat beautifully, plus there's just something about the smoked meat, rye, mustard and pickle combination. The boyfriend gets fries, which are only OK in my opinion. If you have enough room for fries it seems to me you've got enough room for extra smoked meat.

So yes. It's good. It's worth the wait. Don't cheat yourself, just go.",4,2,1

The price is probably OK for the buck for their smoked meat sandwich (since they give you so much meat!), but although it's soft and falling apart, it is absolutely fatty and flavorless.  It has nothing special going for it whatsoever with its pound of meat doused in yellow mustard on soggy white sandwich bread.   Even on the outside bark of the meat itself I was searching for some other flavor than some oppressive salt that they used, and found absolutely nothing worth savoring.

I usually order a smoked meat sandwich and a pickle on the side, because what goes with a smoked meat sandwich like PB&J other than a pickle!
Unfortunately I find the bread to be quite dry and hard... so maybe I could recommend just ordering  a platter?
I would say maybe 50% of the time the meat I get served is pretty good, and the other 50% it's on the old\/dry side... maybe it just isn't busy and dries out? I couldn't say...
But, the staff is always on point there, no matter how busy it is, you'll order in good time and get your food in even better time!

The original Montreal smoked meat sandwich. A pile of fatty, perfectly smoked meat with mustard between two modest slices of bread. The first bite is literally a life-changing experience. Literally. As in, ""taking words in their basic or most usual sense"". Your life will be different after your first bite.

Others have complained about the fries, and\/or coleslaw; reviewing them as separate entities\/menu items. This is nonsense. All in Schwartz's revolves around the smoked meat, and under necessity must be contemplated in its context. They are the perfect companions to the glory of the smoked meat sandwich, especially the Cott's black cherry soda.

The decor is relatively unchanged from the days of yore, a time before the omnipresent distractions of cell phones and other forms of invasive, food-experience-disrupting technologies. The common tables are another drive toward interaction with fellow man; a place where kings rub elbows with paupers.

Just watch your waiters.  Mine was rude and terrible.  I was told by a Canadian friend, that I just received an authentic montreal experience.  But my waiter got everything wrong.  He brought me lean meat, and I wanted to stab him with a fork.  Luckily, he came back promptly with fatty meat.

My colleague at the time said it was the best smoked meat in Ontario. I had no expectation since the only other thing I had that remotely resembled it was Arby's. When I had it, the meat was dry like the desert, and the mustard was over powering the flavour of the meat. So when Banana Girl wanted to try it at Schwartz, I was a little hesitant.


As we were drenched in sweat while walking down the Saint Laurent Blvd during our holidays, we were looking left and right for this place. When we arrived, we immediately walked to a packed store filled with history. It looks like a very traditional meat shop. Employees were dressed in uniforms resembling the movie American Gangster. We sat down dumbfounded, and full of curiosity. We obviously knew we wanted smoked meat but didn't know if there was a selection. The nice waiter (who looked like he worked there for 40+ years) told us that the best was  1\/2 and  1\/2. (Lean and fat) When it came, it looked amazing.


We didn't even attempt to use our utensils. We grabbed the sandwich and we were going for it. Smoked meat in general has a very strong flavor. I have done some homework on the technique of smoking, and understand that dehydration is a part of the process. I can't really explain why juices were coming down my hand. The mustard was a nice compliment to the sandwich itself. I just want to say, I will never have a Montreal Smoked Meat ever again, UNLESS I have the opportunity to visit Schwartz. I've been to the alpha, the mecca of this unique dish. I can`t imagine anything better.

 

Since this is a very short interview, I might as well review the beverage we had. I had a coke to go with the sandwich, and as I opened the can and inserted a straw, I`ve noticed every other table ordered a cherry type of drink. I can`t leave without trying a can. Here we are kids, Cott Dark Cherry Soda. It taste like... Fruitips Black Currant candy. If you don`t know what that is, I can`t help you. The only place you can have this is at Schwartz and Montreal local grocery stores.

For me, there are not many things that get me more excited than talking about meat. To end my dry spell, I could think of no place better to write about than Schwartz's.

On a recent trip to Montreal this spring, Schwartz's was the place that I made sure to stop by.  Founded in 1928, Schwartz's is a Montreal institution and is best known for their beloved smoked meat or viande fumee as the locals call it.  Whatever you call it, smoked meat is just plain delicious.  Unlike pastrami which has a distinct sweeter taste, smoked meat is brisket cured heavily with spices such as cracked peppercorns and coriander.  For me fat equals flavor, so I selected my smoked meat served medium which was the perfect combination of lean & fat cut from the middle of the brisket.  Served between 2 slices of rye bread slathered with mustard, this was the perfect late breakfast on a cold Montreal morning.  

If you plan to visit Schwartz's, keep in mind that this is a small place & does get very crowded with both locals and tourists alike. Unless you plan on taking a taxi here, Schwartz's is also about a 5-10 minute walk from the Sherbrooke Metro station.  Another interesting fact about Schwartz's is that they were recently purchased by a group that includes singer Celine Dion.  Being an old school eatery, I really do hope that they do not change anything as this is truly part of the Montreal experience and was one of the culinary highlights of my trip.",8,4,7

Other than that, Schwartz's is a cool experience. Think of the ultimate New York Jewish Deli, then Quebec-ify it a little bit.

I went for the lean smoked meat, my boyfriend had the medium. I was undecided, especially since everyone on Yelp said recommendations from Schwartz staff dictate medium is best. Still, I'm more of a 'head-in-the-sand' carnivore. I'm happy to eat the juiciest of steaks, cooked to the raw-side of medium rare, as long as it's lean. As soon as I get a piece of fat or gristle to chew on, the true horror of what I'm eating sets in and I lose my appetite. So, for a theoretical vegetarian with the will power of a junkie in a meth lab, the lean was a perfect fit for me. Just juicy enough and the 'OMG -- adorable moo-moo cow!' factor was kept to a minimum. Bliss!

Just as an FYI, my boyfriend tried my lean sandwich and deemed it 'much drier than the medium' so take from that what you will fatty meat lovers.

Their specialty here is the smoked beef.  Their very tender slices of smoked beef melt in your mouth between two very basic slices of bread and mustard.  I also ordered their steak, which was cooked with a delicious pepper marinade.  Not to mention their french fries were crispy and amazing!

Number 4 on their board of items to order. That's the thing you get here (and of course, get some poutine) and that's the thing people will ask you if you got here. 

It's incredibly, wildly popular here. Which doesn't coordinate well with the teeny interior. There is precious little seating, so unless you luck out on a rainy day and arrive with no waiting for a single seat at the bar (but a nearly full house otherwise) at 11:25am, you're going to wait. By the time I left at noon, there was a monstrous line out the door and down the sidewalk. 

If you've made it past those two paragraphs up there, I should also indicate that there's a massive menu here and I feel kind of bad giving you the same tourist info that is undoubtedly on many websites and traveler books. Yes, this is what you get. But it seems like if I were to come back and really dive into the menu, I could find some things that are real treasures. The fellas next to me came in and ordered something entirely different; one was a local and the other visiting, trusting his judgment. Indeed, the menu is actually pretty large.

I delighted in that sandwich, was totally happy to have also ordered poutine, and it was a totally wonderful and pleasant meal. The bread, the mustard, the pastrami; it's hearty stuff and stacked high. Currently it's around $10 for the sandwich, and I was out of there for less than $20 with the poutine. 

Be aware that it's cash only. There's an ATM a few doors down, and they were super patient as I asked directions. The whole staff, in fact, was patient with my questions. Incredibly kind and tolerant. I'm sure I asked the same questions that they're asked a hundred times daily, but they were nice in answering, prompt in service, and got me in and out quick--but not too quickly.

So I dutifully queued up on a holiday afternoon and waited patiently for my turn to take a seat and tuck in. The thing to order is of course the smoked meat sandwich, but there is a choice to be made--are you pretending that this dish can be made healthy and get it ""lean"" or do you through caution to the wind and get the ""fatty""? Well, you can have the best of both worlds and get it ""medium fatty"", which is what I did (my table mates got it lean, and I felt very sorry for them, since it looked quite dry and unappetising). Since I was saving fat on the sandwich, I decided to go whole hog (is that OK to say at a Jewish restaurant?) and got French fries on the side.

The sandwich was very good. Not excellent, but very good. The reason for the reduction in grade was the bread, which was completely uninteresting. If they had something more like a New York rye, with a bit of body to it, it would have been great, but alas, the bread was rather limp and uninspiring. Also, please note that the sandwich is not a NY-style monstrosity that you cannot imagine a person actually eating. The size is quite manageable, so you'll have room for those sides. Unfortunately the fries were a bit lacklustre, but that made me feel less wasteful for not finishing them.

Don't let this deter you.  The line moves quickly because it's not really a place where people can linger; there are only a dozen or so communal tables + a row of stools at the bar.  Also, the staff are pros at keeping track of who's next to be seated, and they turn the tables fairly quickly, too, without rushing patrons to go.
On that note: DON'T try to cut the line.  Unless you're a major celebrity or have known the owners since birth, you'll be unceremoniously bounced out the front door.  We watched at least 3 people try to sneak in during Saturday lunch, and the host\/waitstaff weren't having it.  Fair warning.
Once you're ushered inside, you're directed to the nearest open seat and are pretty much immediately on-deck to have your order ready.  That said, the only thing you really need to decide is whether you want your meat served up lean, medium, or fatty (I went with ""lean,"" and I thought the texture and moisture were perfect), and if you want it served on seedless rye bread or au naturale, i.e. on a plate.  (Tip: skip the bread.)  
From there, your only dilemma is how many kosher dill pickles to order on the side.  (FYI, these are not your typical namby-pamby dill spears, folks.  These are whole, crisp cucumbers, brined and spiced to perfection.  You'll want two.  Trust me.)
The meat is unique (fork-tender, peppery with a hint of smoke, and perfect when slathered with the house mustard); the atmosphere is authentic (the spartan decor looks like it probably hasn't changed much since the 1940s or 50s--in a good way); and the service is fast and efficient.

I hate to admit it, but Schwartz's very-hyped smoked meat* sandwich was delicious. Juicy and never tough, just the right amount of fat speckled with beautiful cracked peppercorns... $6 is actually mighty reasonable for this sandwich, compact but mounded like a pyramid. This was definitely a tourist destination that DELIVERED. (not literally)

*FYI: ""Smoked meat"" is simply Montrealers' term for pastrami, but there was nothing pastrami-like about it. It was corned beef through and through! Which is a good thing since I looooove corned beef and usually find pastrami just a bit too salty\/dry. (Pastrami is corned beef that has been smoked.)

Just a few notes on the touristyness: We waddled into the restaurant shortly past noon. Every single one of the tightly packed tables was full. A waiter was cycling through languages at his table: ""English? Francais? Espanol?"" We were told that to order to-go, you go to the shop next door. I couldn't wait to get out of there.

The shop next door is MUCH quieter, AND it has seating! Why were people in the restaurant at all??? We got our food in under a minute, ate it in peace in the mostly-empty sunny windowed cafe space toward the back, and even had the leisure to gaze at their prepared food items - meat, slaw, souvenir-y items...

When we left, there appeared to be a tour bus lineup outside the restaurant space's door. 30 people stomping in the cold. Why?? Is table service integral to the sandwich experience? Maybe I missed out? My stomach doesn't think so...

You might eat your sandwich with a knife and a fork. And that's fine. (My order? A sandwich, fries to share, a pickle, cherry coke. The A1 steak sauce needs to be nearby, too.)

I don't know if I would call this place 'the best restaurant in Canada' or 'the Katz's of Montreal', but it is terribly good smoked meat, in a style very different from New York delis (bagels and smoked meat - it's what sets New Yorkers and Montrealers apart). It's mouthwateringly delicious, served in a setting that requires that you get close to your neighbour (and I've had some great conversations as a result).

It would really be unfair to compare Schwartz's with another one of my favorite Hebrew Delicatessen's: Katz's in New York's Lower East Side.  It is unfair, but I will do it anyway. 

At Katz's, their specialty is pastrami, which is sweeter and sliced thinner.  They also serve it on rye bread with mustard, and it's also delicious, but it's totally different here at Schwartz's.  Katz's is the undeniable champion of the pastrami and the salami, but this smoked meat thing in Montreal is really special.

Here at Schwartz, the smoked meat is cut by hand into big chunks and slathered on the bread.  It's very juicy and fatty, and more smoky than sweet.  Their mustard and spices work as a perfect counterpoint to the flavors they have working in the meat.  They're subversive.  This sandwich may be perfect as it is.

Got the smoked meat sandwich and a side of cole slaw.  My first reaction is ""I made a mistake."". The 4 people in front of me all ordered the smoked meat by the pound and a loaf of bread for take away and I was the poor schmuck who went with the actual sandwich.  However, being a solo diner looking to follow up this fatty meal with a slow hike up Mt Royal, I think I made the right choice.  However, if its a nice day don't be afraid to have a picnic.

The smoked meat is what I expected, a nice greasy helping of corned beef with some mustard (kind of a cross between yellow and golden...I'm assuming it's proprietary mustard) on soggy bread.  My fat body told my brain that this was smaller than what I was used to, but my brain pointed out I don't need a tower of corned beef and when adjusted for FX, it is likely close to what you get in the states as a pricing point. 

At first I wasn't impressed.  I don't know, I guess I saw the HUGE line for the dining room and all the reviews and I just did not think it held water to the American delis.  However, by the second half of the sandwich the flavor started to hit my tongue.  It's moist and flavorful without being overwhelming.  The Cole slaw was tasty too.  Sweet, but not too creamy.

Bottom line is that I left thinking i miss Attmans of Baltimore and Hymies of the Mainline.  However, this is a solid choice and I may make a stop to the dining room before my trip is over.",0,0,0

This place is arguably the most popular, most crowded tourist-trap in all of Montreal. The lines are extremely long the minute lunch starts.

If you don't like smoked meat, then go elsewhere. They do have turkey and salami, but from reviews, they didn't compare to the smoked meat.

- pastrami sandwiches - the way the wrap it in the paper, it looks like a tiny sandwich compared to what you see in photos on Yelp.  However, once you unwrap it you find a ton of meat inside.  The bread was soft and soaked with some fat, there was just a bit of mustard, and the pastrami was well seasoned.  It could be more moist, but the flavor was great.  You can actually smell how good and tasty it will be when you walk into the store!
- cole slaw - we got the kind without mayonaise, and I loved it.  It was lighter than the traditional cole slaw, yet still tasty
- fries - eh, I've had much better. I'd rather use up calories on another half sandwich.

The most famous place to get your smoked meat fix is, of course, Schwartz's on St. Laurent street. You can tell which one is Schwartz's by spotting the line of excited tourists lined up down the block for a chance to get a seat! The meat (I get mine full-fat, not lean) is juicy and smoky and greasy and tastes amazing with a massive pickle and yellow mustard. Everything you could want from a smoked meat. But personally, I will not wait 30 mins for it-- I usually go to the Schwartz's STORE which is right next door to the restaurant and order mine as take-away.
My honest opinion: Schwartz's smoked meat is really delicious, but not that much more delicious than the smoked meat at le Main across the street! There is never a lineup at le Main, and although you won't get the novelty or feel of the real thing, the food is right on par.",2,0,1

We ordered the regular smoked meat and some soda drinks. The service for the take out counter was efficient and prompt. 

The sandwich was one big, meaty affair. Just looking at it, I was prepared to be blown away. The actual result wasn't as epic though. 

The meat was super tasty, and I can see why this place is famous. But the bread was a little dry and the meal was too salty for my taste buds. Even for a meat-loving dude, I thought that the sandwich had too much meat and not enough anything else. The sandwich's flavour was too one note.  Perhaps I just expected too much?

The sandwich was certainly not the highlight of the meal for me, but it was good and the combination of it and the black cherry soda were fantastic.  The smoked meat on its own was top notch, but the bread just kind of got in the way for me.  I definitely had to add tons more mustard, but better too little than too much, I say.

Schwartz's is the original and have not changed a thing since when they started.  no matter what time of day you go you are waiting in line.  The line does move pretty fast.  This isn't your typical restaurant where you sit around and chat when you are done eating.  When you are done eating GET UP and GET OUT as there are many others waiting for your spot.  They have many items on the menu but why go there and not order the world famous smoked meat sandwich.  The amount of meat that I saw being prepared in the half hour I was there was more than your typical butcher shop.  My sandwich came piled high and still warm out of teh smoker.  The meat was super fresh, warm and tasty.  My fries were crispy and cooked to perfection  The pickle was more like a cucumber found my self eating it with a fork and knife.  Schwartz's is by far the best Montreal smoked meat I have ever had I just wish it was closer.  Every-time im in Montreal Schwart's is a MUST.",5,0,3

After you wait the hour or so line outside to even reach the counter, you'll have the choice of how fatty or lean (or in between) you want your sandwich to be. It's placed in between 2 TINY slices of rye that I believe is just there to house the brick of corned beef you're about to devour.

Schwartz's is a Jewish Delicatessen serving smoked meat among other things. The interior is simple with many wooden tables placed closely together. It appears that the restaurant is almost always packed. We only had to wait a few minutes before being seated however.

Since we had dinner reservations later that night, we decided to just eat lightly.

We had the smoked meat sandwich which was piled high with thick slices of fatty brisket. The sandwich is relatively simple with the only condiment being mustard. The meat has a definite ""beefy"" flavor with extra richness from the nice fat cap. The mustard helps to cut through some of the fattiness however.

It is also hard to go to Canada without having poutine. The French fries were nicely crisp, topped with squeaky cheese curds and smothered in gravy.

Even the waitstaff have the old deli hats.

Let alone, the pastrami sandwich ($5.90) is fantastic. The pastrami is steamed and smoked enough so that the meat breaks down and falls apart in your mouth upon biting into it. The meat is thrown between two pieces of light rye bread  and a light coating of yellow mustard. However, for those mustard pastrami mustard fiends like myself, there are bottles available on each table allowing you to liberally slather on as much mustard to your liking. It is leaps and bounds above many people's expectations. Don't forget to add a dill pickle ($1.60) to add some much needed crunchy texture, and a Cott Cerise Noire ($1.80), a yummy cherry soda, to swallow it all down. If you're really hungry, a small plate of fresh homemade french fries ($2.65), crispy on the outside and potatoey on the inside.

But Schwartz's has been a long-time contender to the famous Katz's Deli in New York City and I couldn't help but to compare the two (they even had a Maxim article comparing the two just above where I was sitting, see photo). This is not your classic Pastrami on Rye that you are accustomed to seeing in New York City. There are subtle differences: from the lighter and softer rye bread compared to the heavier and thicker version sold at Katz's and delis throughout America, simple and sub-standard yellow mustard is used as compared to the more savory deli\/spicy brown mustard, to the pastrami, and the portions are smaller. The flavors in the pastrami are not as deep and smoky, holding a bit of the flavor from its corned beef brethren. But there is one thing that Schwartz's reigns supreme, the price!! For the price of a Pastrami Sandwich ($5.60), Cott Soft Drink ($1.80), Dill Pickle ($1.60), and French Fries ($2.65), it still blows the price of a $14.95 Pastrami Sandwich at Katz's Deli. Sometimes price can make all the difference in the taste of food and that just might do it for me.

And another sidenote: Get there well BEFORE 12pm. Luckily we arrived at Schwartz's at 11:45 AM on New Year's Day when there were still a decent amount of tables empty. But as we ate, the place was fully packed, with strangers squished together and sharing tables. There was no seat unoccupied. By the time we left, there was a long line extending out the door and 2-3 storefronts down.",3,1,2

The subdued sting and jowl seizing bite of mustard contrasts the saltiness of the meat. The juiciness of the beef is pretty much consistent throughout each piece, and this is due to the brining, then the steaming of the meat. Some may argue that the retention of moisture is the attributed to phosphates used in the brining, however, Schwartz's boasts an all natural-non-chemical brining process. To be honest, they could marinade in a stew made of old gym socks, and I'll probably still glob some mustard on it and slap it on rye.

It kind of goes without saying that Schwartz's roots run very deep in Montreal, being opened over 80 years, Schwartz's has had celebrities of all kinds pass through their doors as well as had a musical written about them.

Had been a regular customer for over 20 years... but in the last few years we noticed it is not what it used to be... a decline in consistency little by little... along with an increase in price little by little...

The kicker was when my parents visited the last time.  My father had been hearing about Schwartz's literally for 20 years from my mother my siblings and myself.... and anyone he knew who had made the journey from out west to visit me.... it felt like I dragged half of western Canada to schwartz's over the years... We took my father there and saw it from his eyes... it is no longer the gem it used to be and we will miss it as it was when I first moved here....

We did not have to wait for a table - the only blessing ... we made sure we went early enough to be before the evening rush... so it was busy but not crowded and there was no line. It would have been dreadful to wait for that meal...


Our waiter was a liitle too chatty ... I prefer the old style where they were efficient and slightly rude... you got hot and good food... and we're left alone. he should have spent some time cleaning instead. Our table was sticky and we had to ask for it to be cleaned... we also noticed that the place in general could have been cleaner...and this coming from a man who had eaten in some of the dodgiest places in Asia. 

The meat in our sandwiches was dry and cold. We generally like medium... but not served cold... the fat was hard instead of buttery melt in your mouth gooey. The pickle was OK.  The fries were inedible. They had stopped being home cut for a while but they had always been hot at the very least... not so on this visit. 

We did not eat it... and tried to send it back. They did not offer to exchange it or correct it. We left with the cherry colas in our hands and a sinking feeling in our hearts.... and went to find somewhere else to eat.

Would give it .5 star if we could for the cherry cola and pickle.

Located on rue St. Laurent, a street adjacent to the ever popular Rue St. Catherine, this modest establishment has been in business for over 80 years, serving some of the finest smoked meat you can find around. Everyone recommended this place, from our hotel concierge to my local friends and even random passerbys. Everyone swore by it and warned us that despite the long lines we might face, the experience would be rewarded.

So off we went - all seven of us. We waited in line for a while and finally stepped inside this place. It's tiny, really, especially considering how popular it is. We were welcomed in both French and English and were given menus; not that it mattered, we already knew what we wanted and barely glanced at them. We proceeded to order 7 smoked meat sandwiches, fries and black cherry soda, a local speciality drink. A meal fit for kings, and apparently to the tourists that we are.

The sandwiches weren't as big as the deli ones you get in NYC but just as tasty. The meat was tender, flavorful and absolutely delicious from the first to the last bite. The mustard adds a nice kick to it as well.

The service is prompt and efficient; they were hard to try and turn the tables and minimize the lines; the prices are nothing one should ever complain about, especially considering the quality but keep in mind that they are cash only.

Unfortunately, to get a truly filling meal of smoked meat sandwich you need to order at least 2-3 sides (because the sides' portions here are bloody TINY, unlike across the border in the fat-o-rama known as the US), and the prices are VERY Canadian, with of course a tourist premium.  And if you are unfortunate enough to not carry Canadian dollars with you, they'll take your US dollars but at an exchange rate that's very very favorable to THEM.  So, be forewarned: get some local currency before you head over here!

Anticipate about $20 per person, add another $5 for a non-alcoholic drink.  

The food is great, the service decent, the blue-collar ambience is cozy and down-home and lively, but $25 a head for this kind of deli food is pretty darn steep even in NYC.

So, while I did quite enjoy the sandwich and don't regret coming, I don't see myself coming back here again next time.  I can get a lot more food, and healthier food, just a couple blocks over in Chinatown or in the University area.

I have been to Shwartz's and other delis in Montreal and NYC many times and let me tell you first hand that Shwartz's is also the dirtiest. Often the floor appears to be dirty and the bathroom is always a complete mess you would be lucky if you found soap in the dispensers. Simply disgusting that now the same employees who close up early might not even be using proper sanitation. 

Don't get me wrong their sandwich still tops the list for best smoked meat. However, if you're looking for a real MTL style smoked meat sandwich with better service and cleanliness head over to Lester's and Mile End in NYC.",1,1,0

Perfectly pink, melt-in-your-mouth tender, well seasoned, and trimmed in scrumptious fat... You must have this in your life... And I only tried 1\/4 lb.

Undoubtedly 5 stars and assuredly a must do on every and all trips to Montreal. I was lukewarm to the idea of making a point to visit a Jewish deli in Quebec. How and why would a ""deli"" be a destination.  Even though I saw quotes from an American Francophile celebrity chef imploring tourists to visit Schwartz's I remained non-plussed.

Then I asked my tour guide a life long Montrealer an open question, ""What Québécois food must I be sure to eat?"" - expecting to be told to try pouting or venison, I was surprised when he said our smoked meats and that redoubled when he said Schwartz's is one of the best in the province.

That piqued my interest but I foolishly did not set an intent on this as a destination. Instead I chanced upon it while strolling on St. Laurent and decided to grab some takeout. I was able to order by the pound and being very full at the time only ordered a quarter pound for me and Erin to share.",3,1,1

I was already full from dinner but I was so tempted to eat again just to try the delicious looking smoked beef.  Sadly, didn't want to eat 2 dinners and I've been regretting it ever since.  EIGHT YEARS of regret!

So immediately after landing at the airport, i hightailed it to Schwartz's and it was actually better than I expected! We got there around 9pm on a Saturday and there was a line of about 20 people waiting to get inside. The line actually moved fairly quickly and we were seated at the bar after about 15 minutes. The waiter was very friendly and insisted that we get a sandwich, fries, pickle and a drink. That sounded just about perfect, but just as he put in my order for a medium sandwich, corrected him and told him that I wanted a FATTY sandwich. The FATTY was actually perfectly marbled and and was absolutely delicious. The sandwich was very simply made - about 3.5 inches of thinly sliced smoked beef, with a little bit of mustard, between 2 slices of rye bread. The fries were OK, and the pickle was OK. I wanted some veggies so I also asked for a side of slaw which was tangy and sweet. The sandwich was amazing and I'm glad that I finally got to have one after waiting 8'years for it.",0,0,0

We all ordered the #4, and I ordered the fatty while some ordered the regular and one person the lean. After sampling them all, the regular makes sense for most customers. I wanted the rich indulgence of the fatty but it hasd a lot of fat and on return visits, I'd stick with the regular (the lean was too dry for my tastes). But all in all, just a lovely sandwich. 

I also washed it down with a black cherry soda. I was told that this was their go to drink, but since it came in a can, I was a little bit bummed that it wasn't more of a soda fountain experience.

My sister highly recommended it, but my expectations were not met. 

The smoked meat sandwich was good, but not fabulous.

My friend and I ordered take out (I wonder if that's where the difference lies). If you waited 1.5hrs in line, and you were super hungry, anything would taste that much better. We only waited 5 minutes for take out.

There's a side door that suggests you can just pop by and order some food to go.

For the small price of $6.15 for one smoked meat sandwich, it is totally worth it. By far, the best meal I had during our 1-day stay in Montreal.

(If you just want to read about the Menu\/Food ... scroll down.) 

That's how I felt. I did ZERO research on your beautiful Montreal. Fact is, I wasn't even sure if you drove on the same side of the road as I'm use to. So when I casually asked the rental car attendant where to grab lunch, and was told Schwartz's for smoke meat, I dismissed the idea as something like a Togo's or Quizno's. I'd never heard of smoked meat. It seemed to me logical to go where the guy I was talking to on my flight thought I would like ... Moishe's. ($$$$x10) 

I made my way to St-Lauarent Blvd or Bole St Laurent and saw Schwartz's right next door to Moishe's. The line and the cold temp, 2 degrees Celsius, I instinctively knew this place must be something special. BTW Americans, 2 Celsius is about 38 degrees ... I know, I was confused too. 
I made it in the door of this narrow and tight old old place. The group behind me were told to wait outside. No slack here for anyone. Someone actually wrote a play about this place. Given I was in the door I was going to relax and enjoy the experience as this is just one of those places you need to observe and blend into.

Ten minutes after arriving I was seated at a table for four. Thought it odd as the place was too busy to leave three seats empty. WRONG. They brought four more and we all shared this small space. It was fun. My table mates spoke French beautifully but had no French accent when helping understand the Schwartz's tradition. My new friends were very tolerant of a provincial guy like me. 

THE FOOD. 

I memorized the menu ... its that limited. I had the smoked meat, I think its Canadian for pastrami, sandwich with mustard. (no need to tell them rye bread as that's all they have) and a pickle. Very good. You can order more flavorful (fattier cuts) smoked meat if you want but I took the standard fare. I also had a coke no ice. Not sold on that tradition yet. 

It was a delicious sandwich. The pickle was crisp and snappy. The mustard was obviously home made and the bread? Whats not to love? Jewish Rye. Fresh, moist, great crust. How can you ask for more? Good thing as you wont get it. 

I had a blast and was really glad I decided to try it. Thank you Budget Car Rental and my friends with whom I shared a table. 

My sincere apologies Montreal. Thank you for the intro to smoked meats and a great time.",1,0,1

We arrived around 1PM and there was a short line outside. We must have beat the rush because no more than 5 minutes had passed when someone came out asking the line for a party of 2. Luckily we were the first party of 2 and we were seated in the very back.

The menu is simple and here's what was ordered:

-small smoked meat ($5.90 CAD): I was a bit disappointed in the sandwich actually. I felt the meat was a bit dry and flavorless...except when you happened to get a bite of fat which then made the sandwich moist and flavorful. I think the meat is corned beef (?) so I guess the dryness is part of the meat property?
-pickles ($1.90 CAD): an order consists of 2 and they were crunchy and a bit too salty for me...but definitely good
-fries ($2.65 CAD): crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and not too oily. I might even have to say they're better than In-n-Out! Sufficient side dish amount.

The place is known for two things: the smoked meat sandwich and their cherry soda (which actually, you can find in NYC). Make sure you get the sandwich with mustard and if you plan on ordering the large sandwich, be warned that you make your own sandwich (they give you slices of bread and meat and you can make about 3 small sandwiches).

Schwartz's is good, but I wouldn't say it's exceptional or the best sandwich I've ever eaten. The price is nice though!

P.S.: you can order your meat to be carved lean, fatty and some other in between option. If you don't mention anything, your sandwich cut defaults to lean.",2,0,1

I entered Schwartz a bit drunk around 11 pm, brightly lit with fluorescent lights, my friend and I stumbling in just looking for some amazing smoked meat. Now, Schwartz was effectively pumped up to as much as it could be. My friend's parents ranted and raved, and they're foodies that are friends of the famous Normand Laprise. Christ, I expect the smoked meat to taste like it was carved by God himself. I sat down, at what could only be described as a Waffle House-esque bar, with a bunch of raucous Quebecois night shift workers behind the counter ready to carve me up some meat. I took one bite and... damn. I lost it. It's different from New York pastrami, it's not quite the same. It has a different flavor, not as much strong vinegar, with a distinct smokey flavor, rubbed in pepper and carefully loved until the meat is divine. There's nothing else to the sandwich: two slices of bread, a vegan's nightmare serving of meat, and some mustard. I ordered the sandwich, with (perhaps now I look at it) shamefully, a water and a pickle. Now, I love my dill pickles with my sandwiches, but nothing complimented the intricate flavors of a carefully smoked meat than this homemade dill pickles. If you are not a pickle person, stay away, but if you can appreciate a good deli pickle, get it. All in all, I'll describe it to you. The meat, tender and moist, melted and fell apart like Britney Spears when she shaved her head. It was as good as I imagined it to be. The sandwich itself was just so juicy and delicious I'm sitting in my dingy Atlanta apartment pondering if I have enough money to fly back.

Schwartz's does a great job, the high speed line is efficient and the sandwich is the right amount to fill one person (Katz's you need at least 2 people to eat the thing along with a fork and knife, which can be inconvenient when on the go).

When my local contact met me in the morning, he asked me whether I had ever had Montreal's famous 'smoked meat'. I told him that I saw it listed on the breakfast menu at the Hotel Ruby Foo where I was staying, but I asked him what it was. He didn't understand my question. So I asked whether 'smoked meat' was beef, pork, or what? He looked confused and admitted that he didn't know. Later a meeting finished early, so he said he was going to take me to Schwartz's for the best 'smoked meat' in the city. We parked and walked down the street to find a line out the door and down the sidewalk. It was lunchtime and this place was packed. Eventually we got inside and were hustled down a narrow aisle to a long communal dining table where we literally sat elbow-to-elbow with strangers. A brisk, no nonsense server took our order and rushed away. As I recall you could order your 'smoked meat' sandwich with varying degrees of fattiness. I think medium fat was recommended to me. Soon our meals were unceremoniously plunked down in front of us. A tall 'smoked meat' sandwich stacked high with meat and bright yellow mustard. Some decent French fries and a beverage in a can. One look at the meat told me it was pastrami. So the mystery meat turned out to be pastrami. It was very good pastrami but just pastrami after all. It was obviously a memorable meal because I'm writing about it years later, but something needs to be said about Schwartz's. This deli is probably over 100-years-old, but it didn't look to me like they have ever cleaned the place in all that time. The floors were filthy. There's something to be said for authenticity and historical places, but why don't the owners take enough pride in their shop to clean it? It doesn't seem like they want to provide a clean and comfortable place for their dining guests to enjoy their food. Instead they run a cramped, crowded, dirty place with people standing outside in all weather waiting to get in the door. They're obviously riding on their well-deserved reputation for food but their hospitality leaves a lot to be desired. Oh well, I can say I ate at the famous Schwartz's...",0,0,0

I only waited in the line up for about 10-15 minutes.

Although there was no wait (and available seating), we decided to order a sandwich to-go, so as to enjoy it in the car while watching the downpour. 

While our experience within the restaurant was brief, the service was friendly and efficient; our order was ready within minutes. Back in the car, we unwrapped the smoked meat delight and began our critique. Our sandwich was made without modifications - It was hearty, tender, and very good, although it was a bit too fatty for my taste. Traditionally, the sandwich is served on plain sliced bread, which is fine but it does not add to the overall sandwich. This is definitely a meal where the star is the meat, without competition from condiments, bread, or other features. For New Yorkers, Schwartz's smoked meat sandwich is relatively comparable to Katz. 

While I would rate the sandwich itself a 4\/5, my overall rating was around a 4.5\/5 because of the significance in local cuisine and culture. This smoked meat sandwich was my third favourite food item from Montreal (1. La Banquise, 2. Sesame bagels from Fairmount, 3. Schwartz). I would definitely advise Montreal visitors to stop by Schwartz for a taste of popular Montreal cuisine.",2,0,0

first time trying smoked meat was Dunn's in Vancouver. so the first thing we ate while in Montreal for the Gran Prix was the infamous Schwartz's smoked meat, but before the visit i read some articles (Montreal vs NYC) of how Schwartz's was better,... better even than the king of all jewish delis,... Katz in NYC. now if i've never had smoked meat or a Katz pastrami before to compare especially 4 days later, I would've agreed, but I have and did. 

http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/Montreal-vs-NYC 

first... schwartz's smoked meat vs dunns is not the same. dunns was more pastrami like in seasonings and flavor, while schwartz's is more corned beef. 

to the new there's a huge difference in look but even more important, in taste. pastrami is bolder, smokier, and one they forgot... ""darker"",... not just in its crust... but the color of the meat. pastrami also uses the naval, and corned beef uses the brisket, and there is a difference in texture and a bite.

and to the point of this review. the writers and bloggers in the link does not know what they are talking about, or they forgot to use the word preference. mind you ive only had smoked meat twice (Vancouver and Montreal) and Katz countless times while in NY (25yrs). one could even say that i'm a bit bias, but i haven't had a Katz pastrami since 2012, and while ive had other delis in LA in between, i haven't tasted a katz pastrami for nearly 3 years so my palate has been pretty much Katz's free. i think im able to make a fair comparison having had both in a span of 4 days, and if Schwartz's was better I have no problem stating that. 

nothing on this planet comes close to a Katz Pastrami,... noth-innng. not even Katz corned beef can touch their pastrami. even if you say that you've had both, my next question,.... how many days apart and did you have it to stay while it was still hot. 

i will upload two pictures of both sandwiches and feel free to message me who looks better, and tell me which one would make you run out and get one. also one was close to room temp and the other a bit warmer cause of the steamers they use before slicing (Katz).

other differences is their choice of mustard, Katz uses what we call deli mustard (spicy) and Schwartz's uses yellow. ordered the smoked meat ""medium"" with no mustard and Katz ""juicy"" also no mustard, but one was on rye the other on club bread (NYC). both looked juicy and both had a very distinct and different aroma. based on smell alone, Katz made my mouth water more and i was hungrier while at Schwartz's. texture its Katz all the way. brisket when cooked too long will fall to pieces, and that's why its used for american slow smoked BBQ. Katz was like biting into an aged prime cut of steak cooked perfectly, tender and juicy.

you really can't go wrong with either one, but it comes down to if you like bolder vs milder. if you like Nirvana in your taste buds then its Katz, but if you like Vivaldi then its Schwartz's. with or without mustard Katz wins the flavor and taste test for me because its ""very ape"" in every bite. when it comes to juiciness its a draw, and you can see how juicy both sandwiches are in my pics. 

one aspect we did like at Schwartz's they don't allow you to pile on BS toppings like cheese, russian dressing and coleslaw or sauerkraut like Katz's. great deli is like a great steak, its great on its own. the only thing on both should be a super light schmear of mustard in a bite. that's why its always best to order no mustard so you can add it accordingly on every bite. plus it allows you to taste the meat on its own. 

we did like the vinegar based Montreal coleslaw vs the mayo based, and we both said we could eat that with anything. the pickles could be more sour cause it was like eating wet cucumbers. 

in the end both sandwiches are great in their own right and it will come down to preference. in fact both places are so a like that when I walked in Schwartz I thought I was walking into a smaller Katz which was a good thing.",0,0,1

This is the most accurate description of this place I can give you. After a colleague gave the strongest recommendation possible, we headed over here for a dinner after arriving in Montreal.

Simply put, this is one of the best things I've ever eaten. The meat literally melts in your mouth and you can even choose the level of fattiness that you want. I went with the medium fat meat sandwich which comes with a coating of mustard... Good lord... That's all I can say.

If you add more mustard to the sandwich, it takes things to another level. The kick from the mustard along with the juiciness of the meat makes for an unbelievable taste. I also got a side of cole slaw that was equally delicious.

The meat is already prepared and comes out within five minutes of ordering it. It's a mom and pop type of restaurant that can get a little cramped, but is well worth it. It's also shared seating, so you'll likely be sitting next to strangers at your table. Also worth noting, they only take cash.

Sandwiches are basic, served on rye (ours were un-toasted) with a bit of mustard.  Everything was excellent.

My husband didn't really know where we were heading to when I took him there, and almost gave up once he saw the line, but left plotting to come back for one (or preferably all) of our remaining meals in the city.",1,0,0

I did most of planning for attractions and foods. I researched lots of different travel blogs and pages - they all seem to recommend this as must-try in Montreal. QC, so we decided to take online words.

Inside is nothing special. Just an ordinary deli shop with small tables here and there. I remember reading that 'smoked' sandwich is the way to go and never EVER get the lean version. I decided to roll my dice and try the fat sandwich with fries.

The foods quickly came and I was genuinely pleased with the size and taste of the sandwich. I now see why people come here and recommend this place for must-try in Montreal. However, I didn't think it was all that spectacular. In fact, there are many deli shops just like Schwartz in United States that offer very similar sandwiches if not match the taste. Schwartz may have the history and all the fame in Montreal but it's not the best sandwich I ever had in my lifespan. 

The service was adequate. Nothing great but not lazy either. We didn't ask for much, so the server didn't bother us many times. He already knew we were out of staters not knowing what we're eating, so probably just didn't care much for us.

The price wasn't friendly either. I'm sure the management team hiked the price just for the fame part, but I didn't think it was worth the price we paid for. My meal, which was a sandwich, fries, and drinks were well over $10 CAD. I believe a place like this shouldn't go over $10 for a combo meal.

Although my review may sound little harsh, I did enjoy the sandwich. We got there early for lunch. As we were walking out of restaurant, we noticed a line of 30 or some people outside -- thus explains the fame of this restaurant and Canadians must really love this place for lunch. The restaurant is located in heart of Montreal, St. Laurent Blvd so it's nice to walk around and grab a quick bite if you're not in hurry. Nonetheless, I do recommend this place if you're a visitor from out of country.",1,0,0

Our server was excellent! He was funny, personable, and super fast. With such quick turn over I was expecting crap service and not planning to hold anything against it. But our guy could probably serve the whole place with his eyes closed and just rock it. I loved him.

The place was packed on 3 PM on a Friday afternoon, and luckily we were seated right away. As the waiter came around to take our order, my boyfriend was originally planning to order the pastrami sandwich, before the waiter suggested the smoked meat was the one to try. His exact words? ""After you try our smoked meat sandwich, you won't even want to eat pastrami ever again.""

Was that true? Not exactly.....don't get me wrong, the smoked meat was bommmmb. It was so good, I finished the whole thing and that never happens to me and my small appetite. But some parts of the meat were dry, and I did have to force down a few gulps with water.

Me and my family all ordered the smoked meat sandwich dressed with mustard and pickles on the side. After they arrived, we all started digging in. The smoked meat was amazing. However, more smoked flavor would have made the dish perfect. The pickles were a nice side and served well with the sandwich (ordered separately). The service was quick and fast but also helpful. 

Schwartz exceeded some of my expectations. The smoke meat was great but I was expecting more with the smoked flavor. Also, the check (or bill) was very expensive, costing $46 for four people.

  My mother used to take me here for lunch I'd split a sandwich with my sisters and some fries, nothing beats their warm cuts of meat and trip to flavor town.

 Parking seems to work out okay there's usually a spot on the street and don't forget to use your credit\/ debit or cash at the meters, you will get a ticket in Montreal.                     

 I am lucky to say I have yet to experience a huge line or any line for that matter at Schwartz's ! I've always had timing that I sit right down at one of the large tables side by other people, or at the bar, it all works. 

 I order the medium sandwich, my fiancé likes to try the platter, it's pilled high half a fresh loaf sliced rye bread, a plate mounded with the tender smoked meat.

  I always add more of the mustard thats on the table.. success.  We share a fries, and a couple of waters. We have also tried the steak platter as a appetizer  and its good and flavorful, but the great is in the smoked meat sandwich. My sis likes a cherry coke to make her meal complete.

  The customer service is great, I personally like the old school look of the uniforms and the whole inside in itself, posters and framed articles galore! 
 
 I asked the cashier about Celine Dion and ownership, she told me its Renee her husband who shows up now and then, and one time Celine came in and bought the entire restaurant's lunch that day, which is a nice gesture.

  The bathrooms are tiny tiny so I'm sure no big people can use the bathrooms here.

  Remember to bring cash here! They do have an ATM inside, and there are ATM's outside nearby as well, but save yourself the hassle. They also welcome Canadian and American money, both with a Canadian currency outcome.

Of all Smoked meat I've had Schwartz is for sure the best hands down. My fiance is a fan now too. You can't leave or come to Montreal without trying the amazing sandwiches, they have it down and are very consistent in quality.

They definitely know what they're doing here, highly recommended!",0,0,0

Finally had time to visit Montreal, there was no chance I'd miss going to Schwartz's. Arrived on one of the coldest days to Montreal. The wait was about 10-15mins for 4 couples ahead of me. It was blistering cold outside, my hands and feet were numb from the cold weather. Finally got to the door and as the door opened a gust of the smoked and boiled meat smacked me in the face. At that moment, I knew I was in food heaven. 

Sat quickly by the bar. Ordered a medium smoked meat sandwich and their poutine. Food arrived extremely quickly. One bite into the smoked meat and I knew my life was complete. Meat fell apart upon the bite and melted on my tongue. Slide down my throat effortlessly. I never liked mustard but the mustard was perfect for the sandwich. Bite after bite I soon realized I was eating my fingers. Poutine wasn't worth mentioning. Went next door to the takeout to grab an extra pound of meat just because I couldn't get enough of it.",1,0,1

C'est simple, deux tranches de pain de seigle avec des tonnes de viandes fumées dedans le tout avec une tite moutarde. Alors ce n'est pas de la haute gastronomie certes, mais qui y va pour ça? J'ai testé plusieurs smoked meat mais ça reste ici le best :)",0,0,1

Going to pay the bill and she insists on on the tip : ""you have to pay it, are you gonna do it here or give to the waiter ?"" I know what a tip is, Ma'am and the waiter does deserve it ... but damn, not you !

So I decide to give the tip to the waiter, we put on our coats, get ready to leave, I have the tip in my hand and I'm heading the the waiter when I hear behind me that lovely lady : ""Hey, did they give you the tip ?"" The waiter looks as bothered as I'm surprised ! Damn woman, what's wrong with you ?! I'm gonna give you all my money don't worry !

So, tip the guys, we go out and we won't go back in there, end of story ! Plenty of other smoked meat place in Montreal !",2,1,0

Could only come up with that it was so nice out no one wanted to be inside, which I was very appreciative for.  To be honest i like to call them suckas!

They accompanied a party of 6 with no hassles or sighs!  Staff was super friendly n helpful for us non locals.  

Food is basically a review on the MEAT!  The smoked meat, which i feel needs to be ordered ""medium"".  It provides the perfect amount of fat, moisturizing and flavoring the meat perfectly!   Killed my first Sammy, I had to get a 2nd one. Basically had to look like I was prego for 12 hours but it was 126.83% worth it. 

Besides that the fries were good n my friends said the pickles were outstanding.  Im not a fan of them but if i do make any recommendations from what women say they do like my pickle!  ;-)",1,0,0

Been to a similar place in NYC, better than this one.
Price was bit expensive for a sandwich, their service and decor.

If it's just a random restaurant, i will give a 4 star. 
But with all the hope I got from yelp, I have to give a 3",0,0,0

We had 2 platters:  Combo plate and the chicken combo.  Both of which are served with fries, cole slaw and a pickle.  The cole slaw was good, especially for someone who doesn't usually eat cole slaw.  It wasn't the kind with mayo but tasted very refreshing and light.  My friends tell me the pickles were good and that it was sweet but I didn't get that when I ate it.

The combo plate was a plate of meat with different sections.  We got the medium fat one.  The fattier parts definitely tasted better.  Considering this is their bread and butter, I thought it was just okay.  Maybe it would have been better if I ate it as a sandwich.

The chicken combo had chicken and a little meat.  The chicken was the best thing on the plate.  It was very seasoned and done well too.  The chicken was the highlight of the place for me.

I think I was expecting the meat to taste better.  It was good but no wow factor.  

It's a small place so expect to be sharing tables with others and make some new friends :)",0,0,0

However, be careful you don't overhype it. It's literally a bunch of smoked meat on some fairly dry plain bread with mustard. That's it. That's all you get. Unless you're weirdly obsessed with smoked meat, don't plan on this becoming a regular lunch spot. And I wouldn't say standing in the huge line that frequently snakes down the block is worth it. Wait for a day and time when there's no line. Make the most out of your Schwartz's experience. And be prepared to be underwhelmed.",0,0,0

We ate the smoked meat with plain mustard.  My friend got their fries - which I didn't really care for.  I only cared about the smoked meat. It was really yummy. I can eat pounds of this stuff.  And yes, I have eaten my fair share of pastrami and corned beef in authentic Jewish delis in Mahattan.   I also love me a good reuben...  I mean I know it's not exactly pastrami or corned beef, but I can definitely say I prefer Schwartz's smoked meat to anything I've ever gotten in a Jewish deli in Manhattan, but perhaps I need to do another taste test.",2,0,0
