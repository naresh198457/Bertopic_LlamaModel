Where do I start?!
The casino was smoky,shady characters
roaming, I got diarrhea and stomach cramps the remaining 5 days on my trip from the buffet, blood stained curtains,dirty room. We asked for a crib for our son prior to getting there, they said they would have it, we then got to the hotel, asked again, waited 5 hours and still no crib. Called the front desk again at 8pm and they said they would bring it up, never came. 

I would never stay again nor recommend this hotel to anyone! Horrible customer service and run down hotel.",5,1,0

Bed was very comfortable and rooms were updated with modern decor. We got a gaming card but never got enough points for any free gaming. Part of our stay included free buffets. Buffet was disappointing would not pay full price for food quality there. My rating was based on our rooms. We had breakfast at the Starbucks during our stay. Service their was quick and plenty room to enjoy our breakfast. Stay at TI if you can get a good rate.,0,0,0

This is a 2-3 star in my opinion, so naturally I will not return.  I would rather pay $200 plus\/ night for a really nice property than $100 \/night for this place.
Let me start of with all my positives.  The room was nothing special but it was clean, had everything we needed.  The beds were comfortable with nice linens.  If you are a light sleeper you dont want to be on side facing pool as you can hear pool dj through the walls.
We had to leave the hotel to do everything: gamble, eat, good food, shop, party, see show etc.  Thank goodness the hotel is well located close to some pretty nice properties.  Oh! another positive:  There is a Starbucks in the casino.  Usually not a big deal to me but I'm struggling here for positives. The casino here is terrible.  It really feels like a GreyHound Bus terminal. They literally had duct tape on the rugs as you walk into the casino.  The tape seem to be used to tape them to the floor.  Ugh!!  Really nice first impression.   I have been to nicer Casinos on Indian Reservations in LA and OKLA.  REALLY!!  We waited in line for over an hour just to check in.  Every time I was in the Casino I felt like I wanted to just get out of there.  The ceilings are low, and everything is jam packed in there.  Including all the people.    Seven ladies dressed to the nines looked very out of place walking through the casino, in fact we looked LOST!  ""If Bellagio is the Queen Mary II, TI is a Carnival Cruise""   Sunday at the pool we got a cabana and being a pack of women footloose and fancy free for the weekend we made our own silly fun here all day.  The cute little cocktail waitresses in red hot bikinis took great care of us and a good time was had by all.  No complaints on our day at the pool.  Not fancy, but again- no big deal.  Do your homework.  You can get a room for less the $200\/night on the strip at places like Wynn, The Hotel, Ceasars, Mirage, MGM etc- stay anywhere- dont stay here!!  I have no complaints about any of the staff or service at the hotel.  They were all friendly and hospitable.
This was a girls trip to celebrate my Youngest Sister's Graduation, so regardless of our hotel choice, we had a wonderful time.
One of the girls found the deal $169 for 2 nights, which after taxes and resort fees etc ended up being $220 for 1 of our rooms.  I did not get this deal and my sister and I paid $350 for 2 nights.",4,0,0

The property was sold to him 2 years ago, he was the previous owner of the Frontier Casino.. And guess what?  It is well on its way to becoming the low roller joint that the Frontier was it even has a Gilleys Bar to go along with the TI's old Pirate theme. Pick a theme will you!

As an invited guess on my last visit my room was comp 'ed. So,I figure they like me. Right? I gamble a lot. So what could go wrong ? Turns out everything. 

Night 1 check in was ok then drink in Lobby Bar arrive 11:00 pm                                   I went to the bar for a night cap and ordered a beer, after a few sips I noticed my glass had a chipped razor edge, most likely from it hitting the tap. I notified my server  she then took my half consumed beer and emptied it into a new glass, not even checking to see if a glass chip was in the bottom of my old glass.  Not really a safe move, normally you would get a new glass and a new beer. My server looked like an aging ex stripper who had hit rock bottom. She was rude had no manors and offered no apologies. I paid my tab and went to bed.

Day 2 I hit the pool totally obnoxious sceen loud blaring Rap music that most people we're cringing over and leaving almost as soon as they arrived. That evening I am eating dinner elsewhere as they offer no good food options.  So  I went to the Valet to get my rental car unfortunately the valet gave me the wrong car. The car was somewhat identical but not mime. When I returned  five hours later TI  security almost  tried to blame me even though I had the correct valet ticket. I felt bad for the people who really needed there car I am sure they were upset as well.

Day 3 Service issues with room service a 2 hour wait for a midnight breakfast and  I was on hold for 30 min just for them to take my order! Again crazy bad service  to make matters worse my TV then goes out. So they send a cable guy to my room at 3:00 am rather then just giving me a new room, and he did not get it fixed.

When I got  home I wrote a letter to the TI informing them of my crazy almost comical stay to my surprise I got a phone call from the general manager Mr. Najam Khan, he agreed with my concerns however he did not really apologize but said  when ever I return to Las Vegas just call him and he would gladly comp my next stay, he even gave me his private cell phone number. So three months later I called him for the comped room and this is where the itI really goes down hill. My call to the general manger goes as follows.

1st call to him he says send him and e-mail on my arrival dates which I did twice with no reply. 2nd call 3 days later says he will call me right back no call back. 3rd call a day later he says he's not going to comp me a room and says his room rate's are $290 a night! Which was total BS I am seeing on line the rates are about $70 a night via Expedia. Then I have to remind him of what happened during my last stay. He then claims to have no memory of it lucky for me I saved his voice mail and replayed for him his message from three months ago.  Then he says he has to search for the letter I sent 3 months ago. More stalling more BS.

Botton line this place has sold out it's customer service and is now a low roller grind joint serving the lower end trailer trash crowd and gang banger market. They could care less about the customer  all they want is your money and then they tell you to get the hell out. Stay elsewhere  Ballys, Harrahs, or any MGM property will be better. Oh, the TI has the tightest slot's on the strip too, and they nickel and dime you for everything!  Not safe either a lot of thugs lurking around. Avoid at all cost!",4,4,2

I had a room on the 29th floor overlooking the pool. I was here for a conference and many people on lower floors complained of noise from the cannon ball during the night and some sort of fan system. I like the location on the strip and it's pretty convenient to get to a lot of thins. Mall right across the street with higher end stores over Miracle Mile. Fuck the miracle mile! 

The crowd for Mystere every night was a little annoying. The bars in here aren't so great, a little seedy and felt older than the hotel was. I did not like at night that there is a good fellas looking guy standing at the elevators asking for keys abrasively. Nor do  I care for the almost exact looking guy guarding the pool, which by the way is in the weirdest location, you can see it from every angle of the hotel except for where the entrance actually is..... it's odd. Gambling is so so, not the worst but not a great variety of slots. These penny slots are the biggest rip off, I want the old days with nickle slots.

Asked for a room upgrade and got it the second nite, not the first ( I had even emailed the manager ahead of time and said this was a special trip for my 11 yr old son) The upgrade was nice, big jacuzzi, lots of space....would have been nice to have it day 1! I don't know why people are hating on the buffet....I thought is was awesome! Mystere is a terribly boring show, don't waste your money on it....I actually fell asleep! The decor in the room is standard, nothing to write home about....comfy beds, not enough blankets tho!!! and no robes, even in the suites...but over all it was comfortable....now for the REAL problem....the pool was closed! Said nothing about that on its website. At first I was told it was closed for season, then I was told maintenance. The hotel charges u a ""resort fee"" for the pool, internet and the fitness room, this is BS in my opinion but its pretty standard... but if your POOL IS CLOSED!!!!?????? I asked the very uninterested manager Kenny Cho if they could get reciprocity at another pool so my son would have something to do. First he said no but then walked over to the concierge desk with me. The 2 women working there said yes, we could us Ceasar's and The Cosmo, so we went and checked them out. We pref the Cosmo but there was a small sign saying for guests only. We walked in and looked around and no one said anything but as we left I started to worry that we would get there the next day and they would thro us out. So the next am I went to concierge desk to ask them to call over and make sure.
Before I even reached the desk, I could tell James behind the desk had an attitude. He told me the sign told me everything I needed to know. I asked him to call anyway. he pursed his lips and sighed. Picked up the phone, took the first no he got from the first person and hung up. He gave me a self-satisfied look. I said that the women yesterday had said it was ok. He said that wasn't his problem. I didn't have a fit because my son was there but we walked away...I guess we looked dejected because a lovely woman stopped us and asked wht was wrong. I told her ansd she said ""give me a minute"". She went back to the desk, and came back with passes to Ceasr's for us and said there will b no problem....and if there was to call her directly. Her name was Melissa...she deserves a raise.
James at the concierge desk, should be fired.
Kenny Cho needs sensitivity training.
We did get the upgrade, that was good...and we eventually got the pool....but the hotel should have offered us some other token. It is their JOB to make things right....they are in the hospitality business. 
James would be better suited as a bill collector...he has that demeanor.
Mr Cho may well be a good manager but I don't think hospitality is his game.
I will not be back.

He was giving us a king bed and I requested the double queen bed. Finally found one with accessible shower which wasn't that pleasant at all.  

When we got to our room,  there was a cup with soap in front of our door and then we found a cup of beer in the closet!  The bathroom sink faucet had some sort of smell when it was in use.

What an awesome deal for the new year: 50% off almost all rooms for the weekend of 1\/6-1\/9 and i cant complain especially for the awesome price for two standard connecting rooms. The rooms are clean and neat. Wish they had a bigger TV tho. Suites aren't that big, but big enough for two roll away beds to fit in there. I enjoyed the two standard connecting rooms though. 

Housekeeping here are really nice and friendly. Front desk check in took a while due to complications w\/ the computers but the lady Connie was real nice, shes AWESOME.

Besides that, no windows for fresh air = weak. Shower is weak, i need some stronger water pressure up in there. Their irons suck, leaked water all over my clothes when I try to iron.

Lastly, the black jack tables. Whoever the asian male manager is down there, that fool is a trip. The dealer already checked my friends' ID's and my ID too, then this fool comes over and asks if the dealer checked our ID's and she said YES. No shets sherlock. Then this oompa loompa went ahead and asked us if we were even 21. REALLY? we already got carded and you still trippin about it? damn idiot. A few of the girls may look young, but we're all at least 22.

I hadn't stayed here prior to their remodel, but I'm assuming lots has been upgraded. The decor (carpet, lounge chairs, etc) is really nice with a modern touch and colors. There was also a flat screen TV and iPod docking station, if that is of importance to you. The bed was SUPER comfy, just the right firmness for me. The pillows, while not down, were very comfortable as were the high thread count linens. The only reason TI isn't getting 5 stars from me is their bathrooms.

Very kind staff.  Very patient.  Decent, clean rooms.  Comfy beds.  I honestly had an okay time staying here.  I had low expectations so that may be why.  

Some cavaets on whether or not you should actually care about my review or not: I was staying here for a work trip (i.e. I didn't actually pay out of my own pocket), I was here during weekdays (Tues-Fri), was only mostly sober and am not much of a gambler (work or play).  

All that being said, I found the rooms to be very clean but surprisingly worn or showing signs of age, especially in the bathroom.  TI is gonna need a renovation in a few years!  The bedroom\/living area was in the best shape. Everything here was recently updated and clean (at least within a few years) - flat screen TV, ipod docking station\/alarm clock, wifi, and modern-ish furnishings.  The bathroom, however, either didn't get the same treatment...its been heavily abused since it was last redone....
The door and counter & finishes had all seen better, smoother, shinier days.  Despite the wear in the bathroom, the plumbing had no issues. No problems with water pressure or leaky faucets or anything like that. 
The things that really matter are good\/great and clean - linens, towels, tub\/shower, sink, counter, desk. The bed is comfy and cozy. 

Service was great!  The staff were very accommodating, friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and patient.  My boss realized she lost her driver's license at the airport when we were checking in & came a hair close to having a full-on panic attack!  The staff handled all this drama with ease and professionalism.  They helped in calming her down and were able to find useful solutions (the reservation was in her name so they were able to help get us checked in despite the missing ID).  The bell desk were the best and went out of their way and called the airport, taxi, airline, etc searching for her ID on her behalf. With their help her ID was found by the Southwest Airlines baggage claim desk!  I also had a more minor situation (the hairdryer in my room wasn't working), but it was handled quickly (I got a new dryer literally 5 minutes after calling housekeeping)!  The service alone was a big highlight. I felt comfortable asking any questions and felt like the employees knew their hotel and knew the city. 

There is a great fitness center - decent amount of machines and equipment (& pretty updated\/new) for a hotel, fresh towels, free water, lots of TV screens to distract you from the agony.  The down side is you need to pay an extra daily resort fee to access it.  The good thing with that though is that the fee also includes internet access in your room, so taken with that the price is more than reasonable.  So pay the resort fee! 
 
As for pricing and gambling action, I can't really speak to those like I said earlier. 

The decor is pretty blase and cheesy.  Personally, I thought the whole Pirate thing and the Sirens show was ridiculously cheesy. Not worth the time. 

Pros: Great service, comfy beds, vents that allow you to let fresh outdoor air into the room, bathtub (!!!), efficient taxi stand, fitness center, spa, clean, great location (near lots of shopping, the Wynn & Encore hotels, etc).

Cons: Mediocre to average restaurants, worn out finishes, boring decor, cheesy pirates, the Christian Audigier nightclub...even if its closed, the general atmosphere in the casino\/public areas.

Bottom line, I would stay here again and probably be pleased with it.  Its clean and not sleazy. It works.  Although if you're not staying here, there's no real reason to come here in my opinion.  If you just need a clean, comfortable place to stay, then go for it!",1,0,0

*Checkin - we came after 5pm short line and moved quickly.
*Room - stayed in a standard 2 queen bed. Partial view of the strip and pool. Clean, modern decor and air con worked well. Housekeeping always did a good
Job.
*Parking - valet was always full when we pulled in. However, I found it easier to self park at this parking lot in comparison to others. First, there's tons of
Parking and the lanes are wider and make for easier turns and access. Close to the 15hwy as well. You can avoid the strip of you want to.
*Casino - I can't complain on this trip because all of our party got good payouts on the slot machines. The area is clean and good smoke ventilation. There is also a few shops and my favorite - CVS and Starbucks are in-house. We really didn't need to leave much.
**BED - this is why I will only give hotel 3 stars instead 4 - it was stiff! Both beds. There was cushioning, but still hard. Holiday Inns have better beds! My only disappointment!

I only ate at the buffet. Save your $$. For
That much per person, there are better buffets. I'll review that separately.

We are frequent guests at this hotel's stay here several times a year.  The last time we were here we were not charged a resort fee.  Today we went to use our 2 for 1 Buffet but we were advised we needed the coupon we get from check in. The buffet cashier told us to inquire with the front desk.  We go to the front desk the guy said we did not pay a resort fee.  When we checked in the attendant at the front desk told us the resort fee is waived and did not charge us the fee.  The person at the desk told us (in a rude manner) there's a difference between the fee being waived and comped. We told him that we were not given a choice when we checked in the attendant told us the fee will be waived (we assumed they weren't charging it to us since we are frequent guests). Bottom line's attendant was rude.  The front desk was not clear with things.  Very dissatisfied with this last stay. We will not be staying at this hotel anymore. 

Lastly the valet has been horrible the past 4 days. Is it too much to ask to open the passenger door?  Every hotel we have every been to in Vegas,  the valet attendants have always opened the passengers door.  Mind you the valet wasn't busy during our stay (during the weekdays it's kind of slow... plenty of times we were the only ones waiting in the valet). Last night the valet phone was ringing over 5 minutes and there was no one at the valet desk.

I remember when I was a kid this place was very tacky, tourist-y, and pirate-y. It was so very themed and so very Vegas. That pirate show was my everything. I miss that Treasure Island. 

Anyways, this hotel is a piece of shit now. They are under some ownership and call themselves TI or something, trying to be all swank. 
A friend of a friend was staying here in a suite so after the club we went to hang out and party some more. 

For a ""suite"" I would have to say that this was NOT impressive. It was very dated and actually very small. Their ""strip view"" was really lame because the window was SOOO tinty! Also, dumbshits only booked one King bed. HAHAHA! So, it got later, shit got weird, I was sobering up so I decided to go have a smoke downstairs in the casino. I told my friend I was taking his room key and going downstairs to have a cigarette or two. 

I go downstairs by myself and go into the dead ass casino. It was probably like 3am. It was depressing. I was gonna play slots but I remember how tight the slots in Vegas are  so I  just sat down and lit up a cig. While chilling, I was approached by a man in cargo pants. He worked for hotel security. He proceeded to ask me for my ID and told me I looked young. He asked me a bunch of questions about where I was staying and who I was here with. He then told me he needed to take my ID and show it to his manager. OKAY WTF! He came back and I told him I would just leave and to let me just take the room key back up. He said, If i called metro right now you would be arrested for burglary. UHHH for burgaling what exactly??? What in the hell. So I called my friend not knowing whether she would answer and told them what was up.

They came down and rescued me. I think he just wanted proof that I knew people who were staying here because yes, he thought I was a lady of the night, working the TI. I was still in clubwear, mini dress and heels. Could be read as hooker, but I'll credit my girlfriend with saying ""you looked like you were gonna put out maybe, but you don't look like a prostitute."" Thanks gurl.

PROS-
-quick elevators
-very comfortable bed
-close to Venetian\/Palazzo, Mirage and Wynn
-great price

CONS-
- there was no trashcan in the main part of the room only in the bathroom. Maybe it doesnt seem like that big of a deal just annoying not having it there and having filling up the bathroom one with beer bottles etc
- slow  or non-existent cocktail service in casino. I ordered an drink waited for 20 minutes and it still never arrived. Ended up switching machines a  few different times as I proceeded to play $200 in penny slots and still was never served a drink the whole time!
- not a great selection of restaurants. We did eat at Kahunaville for breakfast great price and very filling.
-super slow check in. Checking in at 2pm on a Saturday and there was a line of maybe 40 people waiting to get checked in and 3 agents working. 

In regards to the resort fee,I guess we lucked out because even though when we checked it she said it would be $22\/day  when we checked out we were never charged for it! I had however took advantage of the internet thinking "" hey if I'm paying for it why not use it?"" So we were charged $15\/day for that.

I planned a long weekend of fun for my son and I and we ended up booking at TI.  I won't lie ... I was nervous because it's VERY different from the Palazzo, but you know what?  We loved it and had a great time.

Check-in was a breeze and our strip view room was great.  Our agenda was to be poolside by day and dining out at fabulous restaurants by night.   Done and done.

The pool was super fun!  While you couldn't place your lounge chairs IN the pool (like you can at the Palazzo), they had bench seating all the way around the pool so you could easily kick back and enjoy the sun from there.  We also rented a couple of day beds so we could ensure our sunning comfort.  A DJ plays from 12-6 which really helped the vibe.  The crowd was a total mix of kids, 20-somethings and up.

The room I stayed in was clean (compared to some more expensive rooms in other hotels I've stayed in Vegas). The location was decent. It's close (walking distance)to the party's at the Wynn hotel and also to pick up some tasty treats at the world famous Carlos bakery in the Venetian.  The first few days I hung out at the pool at the with my wife and nieces. The pool party was ok. The pool was tiny, but the DJ was on point and the crowd was feeling it. Their pool party was not at the level of other famous one, but nonetheless I enjoyed myself. The restaurant was good (the prices were not bad) and they had  a vegetarian choice on the menu too. Inside the hotel I really loved the Vietnamese restaurant. The pho was outstanding and my party ate there a few times. I paid about $16-18 a plate at that restaurant. Another place that we went to was Senor Frogs Mexican restaurant and once again it was not disappointing. The restaurant doubles as a club at night. We went and the music was mostly hip hop music that was good to dance to. The dance floor was packed.

I get to the lobby and the line was kind of long.  30 minutes later I get to the counter, my reservation could not be located and I had to wait another 10 minutes till reservations fixed it.  My clerk was helpful, I asked if the wait was normally that long, he said no, in fact they had one of the busiest check-in days ever that day.  He apologized for the wait and gave me a room with a better view and sent me on my way.  It took me a while to find my room, as it was on an upper floor and on the end of the wing.  I open the door and was in ah.  It was a beautiful room, view of the strip in both directions.  I couldn't be happier with the accommodations.  The bathroom was large, good size tub.  The bed was comfortable and the sheets were very nice.
I had a good time in the Casino, left with more money than I started...always a plus.
I ate at most of the restaurants in the hotel (see separate reviews) and saw Carlos Mencia perform (highlight of the weekend)
The staff was always helpful and courteous.  They took care of every legal want and need.  I will be staying there again for sure.",0,0,0

For the kids (loved it when I was little): an awesome arcade where you can win prizes and a crazy ""climb the ladder"" game where you can win a huge stuffed animal or fall *splat* onto a big bouncy cushion.

For the young adults: The fun club, Orange (I think is the name?), with a great dj, strong drinks, and a cool outdoor area.

For the older family: The crazy ""Senior Frogs""-style bar where you can watch the bartender swirl tequila bottles followed by free shots for all... (also a good pre-game for the club)

For everyone: The outdoor pirate show!",14,8,14

We had never thought to stay at TI but found a great deal online. Our suite was beautiful!! The view from our room was just breathtaking. Room service was timely- better than expected really. 
More than anything, I wanted to spend our days at the pool. Saturday we laid out, drank & loved the DJ!! The music was EDM\/Hip Hop- what you would expect at a pool\/bar setting. Because of our experience Saturday, we got a Cabana on Sunday to celebrate my birthday. Unlike the day before, we did not start out the day so great. The DJ on Sunday was HORRIBLE!! He played country music and 80's music, in between he would say ""Taking requests"". My girlfriends and I went up to him and asked if he would play ""Todays Hip Hop"" or even just ""Today's Hits"". This DJ was extremely rude, stating he has been mixing it up & will continue to mix it up!! We couldn't believe how offended he was and after that he played more country. I'm not against country music at all, I actually love it! However, playing ""Friends in low places"" is definitely NOT a song you want to party to. We let our waitress know about how rude he was and she told her manager. The manager spoke to the DJ and nothing changed. We spoke to our waitress again and she said the DJ was also rude to her manager and that they were working on talking to someone higher on the ranks. 
We had only planned to be at our Cabana from 9am-4pm. It wasn't until about 3pm or so, that the DJ finally started playing Today's Hits. We were told that one of the managers were able to get ahold of the DJ's boss to complain. Too bad we only enjoyed about an hour of our pool time that day.
I would not recommend TI if you want to spend your days at the pool or Cabana. However, if you are solely going to Vegas for the hotel, food & night life then this place will suffice.",1,2,0

Want to check-in early or check-out later? Just add $30 each! Heads up, the express check-in line is the only check-in line so even if you paid $30 for express check-in, be prepared to wait a good while especially if you're coming on a busy weekend like EDC. 

I dislike how the self-parking garage is pretty much on the opposite end of the hotel so it can be a trek. The pool can get fairly crowded and the sun is brutal. 
Make sure you have your room key to show the attendant before you can enter the elevators. Also the jewelry store and lotion girl will be bugging you daily to try and get you into the store.

The rooms appear to be newly renovated and look aesthetically pleasing. The bathrooms are very spacious and even come with a vanity mirror.

Couldn't beat that, especially for that part of the Strip (close to Wynn\/Encore, Venetian\/Palazzo, The Mirage, Rockhouse, Fashion Show Mall, etc.).

I was surprised by the remodeling. I thought this hotel was hella outdated but they're managing to keep up with the times. The rooms are spacious, more than enough for 2 people but of course it's not a Venetian-sized suite. The beds here are so comfortable; very helpful when you wanna sleep in after a long night out on the town. 

I thought it was cool that they had a pho restaurant, although we didn't eat there. Mostly, my friends and I tended to venture outside of TI for dining options. Nothing at TI really caught our eyes. Same here goes for the bars and nightlife. If you stick the name ""Christian Audigier"" to a nightclub, I'm definitely gonna avoid it for sure. Never in the mood to see a bunch of guys in pec-hugging Ed Hardy tees. No thank you.

Basically, they have good rooms to sleep and pre-game in before a long night out. But other than that, they really don't have anything that keeps you staying there during the day.

And they should really think about getting a new show to replace Mystere. That show's been there for at least a decade. You know how Vegas is - always looking for the next new and best thing to attract customers and keep them coming back.",0,0,0

I'm aware that my reviewing days may be numbered when she sees that I outed her age. : )

My current life expectancy aside, let's talk about Treasure Island shall we? This will focus strictly on the hotel and it's amenities, not the casino, since all Vegas casinos are essentially mirror images of each other. 

We arrived on Friday night around 10:30pm and proceeded to the check in. There was, of course, a long line, but it moved relatively quick. Upon checking in we were greeted with this welcoming news: ""There will be a $25 resort fee per day of your stay, but we will waive today's"". Resort fee? I had heard about this before the trip, but forgot the deets. Well, for $25 you get internet and tv, 2 for 1 buffet MONDAY-FRIDAY only, access to the gym, a newspaper, and the ability to print boarding passes from the guest service center. 

Let's break this down.

To Do in Vegas:
1. Party
2. Gamble
3. See Shows

To Skip in Vegas:
1. Watch TV
2. Be Online
3. Workout

What else is there? 2-1 buffet Monday-Friday. Well, it's now the weekend. That's out. Newspaper? I don't care. Print boarding passes? Can do that at the airport. SO! In conclusion, what am I paying $50 extra for the weekend for? Nothing. 

That little quirk aside, let's talk the room. Pretty standard fare, but lacking an in-room coffee maker, which would have been nice. FYI, the in-hotel Starbucks charges $4.89 for a grande brewed coffee. No way are they going to just GIVE you a coffee maker of your own to use. Our sink in the bathroom had a slow drain, and the internet wouldn't connect at first. Yes, for $50, we're damned sure going to use the internet while waiting on each other to get ready! I put in a complaint to the front desk and within 5 minutes they had a maintenance guy show up and fix both sink and internet. Shouldn't have been that way in the first place, but the immediate response was appreciated. 

The bed was extremely comfortable, and our view was superb! We were on the 18th floor looking down on the pirate show they have going on! There's something pretty awesome about fireworks exploding right outside your window!

The hotel's pool was small by Vegas standards, but nice nonetheless. It was heated, and with daytime temps in the mid 60's, it felt fantastic. Best of all, they don't care if you take your drink in with you!

Overall, the hotel was pretty nice, but didn't really scream 4-yelp-stars at me. I would stay there again if I found a fantastic deal, but wouldn't necessarily aim to return otherwise. The location is perfect, though (lower end of the strip but closer to the REALLY nice hotels\/casinos). 

Oh, a word to the wise. Weekend buffet is $27 PER PERSON. Cheap buffet this is NOT. Do like everyone else on the strip and hit up the closest Denny's for a much more affordable breakfast.",4,6,2

The casino floor was definitely not as fancy as some of the other hotels: for example, I previously stayed at The Venetian and there's a definite difference in the gaming portions of the hotels. Also, the food options are not great within the hotel itself.

*What is up with check-in and check out?!? We had to stand there for, get this, just shy of TWO HOURS for them to honor our reservations.

The casino area is small in comparison to some others, but it suited us just fine.  There are more slot machines than tables.  The hotel had a few restaurants, a variety of types and styles.  We did have a breakfast and dinner at the buffet.  Breakfast was much better than dinner and was only $16, cheap compared to most buffets.

We enjoyed our dinner there and had great service, although we weren't satisfied with the expensive drinks that we ordered from the fruity cocktail menu.

For a guest who purchased the room on Priceline, an additional $20 a day was a big surprise.  It should already be included in the room price, if they have to raise the rates then they should.  It's sneaky to tack on that extra fee!  Also, our towels smelled awful.  The only way I can describe them is that they had a ""burnt"" smell.

It's only a few minutes away from the mall and other major casinos. The addition of the CVS in the lobby helps prevent you from overspending on cocktails at the bars. If you forgot your toothbrush or other products you can conveniently purchase those at the lobby now. 

Treasure Island is quite sneaky with their prices. They offer great prices for the room but they'll hit you with crazy resort fees when you check in. The resort fee is $30. They claim it covers wifi, the hotel gym, parking and other amenities that you won't use. I bet 90% of the visitors don't use those amenities. To make you feel better they give you a stack of coupons to their crappy restaurants. You'll get buy one get one beer at Senor Frogs or a free appetizer at the steakhouse.

The room designs are not very modern. You'll find dark carpeting and beige color wall painting in most rooms. Don't expect a fancy mini bar or a fancy walk in shower. I guess it doesn't really matter if the purpose of your visit is to party. 

The check in and check out at the Treasure Island is terribly slow. The staff will tell you it's the system their currently using. Perhaps they're still running Windows 97.

The whole lobby and casino floor was scented with a perfume-like fragrance which was way too strong. The scent was so strong it felt like my nose was burning inside. I'm not  kidding.

The Check-In line was long but went by reasonably quick, but it was pretty warm for a hotel lobby. I was pretty uncomfortable.

The room floors did not have that awful scent the lobby and casino had. 

The A\/C was not as strong and cool as I was hoping for when I entered the room.  

The wifi internet did not work when I needed it. When I called the front desk he said to wait 30 minutes so he can reset it.  

The shower head was so clogged up it didn't work very well. Looked too old.

The window in room was too small, but view was nice of strip.

The guest service book was no where to be found as well.

A new towel that was hanging in bathroom had a huge brown and yellow stain on it. It looked so disgusting.

The ironing board was stained and very dirty looking, but iron was in great shape,

Bed was comfortable and pillows were too.

The TV is a small LCD screen that has low end quality.

Although the location is great if you want to see other hotels that are walking distance to it like the Belagio, Ceasars, The Venetian, The Wynn, and even the Mall.

It was relatively inexpensive when I booked it, but recently I saw they were charging $230\/night, that's double what I paid . I felt ripped-off when I paid about $115\/night for my stay.",3,0,1

We don't mind paying alittle extra for amenities that make our stay nicer and the hotel claims to be 4 star. Not that this review will be long winded but if you want a four star hotel this is far, far from it.

It was a one night stay so what could go wrong?  The room we were given was a standard room with two beds.  When I travel my biggest wish for a hotel, any hotel, is that it is clean.  Our room had serious cleaning issues: backed up sink, black mold in the shower, black marks on the walls, closet and corners and a bug casing on the wall.  I called down to the front desk and complained so they upgraded our room to a strip view room.  The room was basically the same but with a small window with a view of the strip.  

We had dinner in the hotel at Canter's which was very good. We returned to our new room to find new problems.  We were missing shampoo and bath towel so I had to call housekeeping. Just before retiring, I set up my laptop on the desk to find a sticky syrupy red mess on top the glass top. YUCK! Didn't know what it was but I cleaned it up so I could get to bed. Then my wife comments we are missing pillow cases. Half of the pillows didn't have pillow cases.  In all of my travels I have never seen this.

And I've stayed in every type of hotel from the Ritz Carlton to Motel 6. From all of my experiences, I have found that hands-down, Treasure Island has had the absolute worst customer service I've ever encountered.  I felt like the employees felt that I should be honored to stay there.  They were not receptive at all and asking for anything was very uncomfortable.  I have many examples of their rude behavior but I will only share a couple examples.  The first example was at check-in; when we came in, it was 2:30am and we were really tired because our flight was delayed but I felt that we were still in a good mood since we just arrived in Las Vegas.  When we talked to the girl at the desk, she indicated that we would not get what we reserved. We reserved 2 beds in a non-smoking room.  Her reason was that we booked through a third party and therefore don't have the right to reserve a room.  I didn't know that booking through a third party would make my money any less valuable  When the person I travelled with said that we should be upgraded, she said that it would be impossible because once again, we booked through a third party.  Enraged by this information, I asked to speak to the manager, whom she called and poof!  We had the room that we reserved after all.  Of course, the girl made it seem like she did us a really big favor.  Later on, I read online that at this particular hotel they do this, so they could obtain tips.  I'm sorry but I will not be forced into tipping somebody for something that was expected of them anyhow.  Now if they went above and beyond, I could understand that and would tip generously.  Another example was when I needed a sweatshirt laundered.  I filled out the sheet in my room which indicated that the cost would be $5.50 to launder a pullover, put the sweatshirt in the bag, and called down for them to pick up this bag.  They would not come up and pick it up and forced us to go down and wait in a line for 10 minutes to provide them the bag.  (BTW, we waited in line 10 minutes and when it was our turn, the girl at the desk turned to another customer who just walked up to the desk and helped her, who didn't wait in line and just walked up, rather than help us who were waiting for a long period of time.)  Then when the sweatshirt was ready, they told me it was going to be $8 and they didn't want to bring it up to the room.  At this point, I was insistent that I should only pay what the sheet indicated, the $5.50, and that somebody drop the bag off to the room.  I was on vacation and didn't want to keep running up and down for errands...that's why I was at a hotel.  Furthermore, I had to argue with about 3 people to get the rate of $5.50.  They finally called me back about a half hour later and indicated that $5.50 was fine and that somebody would come up with the sweatshirt shortly, although that took another half hour.  Furthermore, the hotel wouldn't charge anything to my room, although they had my credit card on file.  They wanted a large daily deposit before doing this, which I've read online that wasn't returned in a timely fashion and many times, customers had to argue to get that paid back to them.  I did not want to deal with Treasure Island ever again, after this experience so why in the world would I allow them to hold a hefty deposit on my credit card.  I've never been so unpleasantly surprised and dismayed at their lack of complete customer satisfaction.  In addition to their lack of customer service, the rooms did not have refridgerators, coffee makers (of course coffee there was so expensive so why make something like that convenient), the décor was ancient, the smell throughout the hotel was disgusting (the smoke from cigarettes and cigars wouldn't have been so bad, but that scent that they have piped into the casino smells like a sweaty stripper), the hotel nickel and dimed you for everything (ie. room service was expensive but when ordering it, you'd be charged an extra charge just to order it, etc.), the pool and surrounding  area were closed down due to  renovations (it was January and I probably wouldn't swim but it would've been nice to read a book by the pool since I live in a colder climate),  and many more things.  I would never recommend this hotel ever.  I've stayed in some shacks in Europe in  my past and would prefer those to this experience any day, mostly because of their attitudes towards customers.",0,0,0

(Keep in mind it was only 7:30 p.m.) He also told me that it was most likely the house keeping staff because ""they have issues with that"" Also keep in mind I always had the do not disturb sign on my door because I didn't want anybody in my room. The front desk management didn't seem to care that I was robbed. They offered nothing to make my stay better or make me more comfortable. They were barely apologetic at all. In my opinion they could've at least offered us a free dinner or show tickets. Treasure island has so much money it would not hurt them to try and accommodate a guest who was robbed (especially in their ""best penthouse suite""). In the end after they did their ""investigation"" (which conveniently enough didn't start until I was checked out and returned home) they decided that i was not entitled to any form of compensation. When I asked about security cameras they told me they don't have cameras in the hallways for ""privacy"" reasons. I highly urge you NOT to stay here!!

I distinctly answered ""NO"" to leaving my card open to having incidentals charged to my card.  Well guess what?  Christian, who checked us in, apparently thought it better and took it upon himself to leave it open.  T.I. put a hold of $500 on my card.  This is similar to a security deposit when you rent a car.  My card had a ""reservation"" placed on it and because stupid me used my debit instead of credit, my bank red-flagged my account due to suspected fraud and blocked it from further charges.  I found out the hard way with my card being declined the next day.  Thanks a lot, Christian!  Went down the next day to get it straightened out and they apologized and made the correction, but three days later my bank still hasn't released the hold.  I'm not blaming my bank for the hold still pending, but this all would've been adverted if directions would have been folllowed and a simple keystroke would've been correctly punched!

Everything else about T.I. was satisfactory and I would probably be rating it 3 stars if it were not for the mishap with check-in.  The deal we got was actually a steal: $45 for Sun night and $40 for Mon night with 2 free buffet coupons each day.  Although the free buffet coupon was only good Mon - Fri.  Buffet, ehhh.  Still, the rates themselves were great.  The Sirens show is temporarily close until after Christmas, but judging from reviews for that, didn't miss out.  Pool was closed, but it's friggin' 50 outside at this time so who'd be swimming?  So, wouldn't you think they'd ease up on the $20 resort fee????

We had adjoining rooms, one with a king bed an the other with two queens. The beds were comfortable and soft, leaving me rested for long evenings of silliness and debauchery. The rooms were minimally, but tastefully, decorated and the bathrooms were huge. Other than the safe and refrigerator, there were few extra amenities. But, given that we were getting both rooms for dirt cheap prices (two rooms for two nights: under 200 dollars total), I can't complain too much. The household staff kept the rooms tidy and there were no early morning interruptions (particularly annoying when you have the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign up.)

Anyway, living in California, I've become used to all buildings being smoke free...which obviously is not the case in Vegas. The air filtration system certainly helped. But there was also a fragrance they add to hotel casino to cover up the smell of smoke. This was a bit of an annoyance, as the smell nauseated me: kind of sickly sweet vanilla marshmallow. Yuck.

At first our room was a smoking room on the 10th floor, but it reeked, I called the front desk and I kid you not in minutes we had a bell man helping us move. WOW, I have never experienced service like this. 

Pros:The room was spacious, and impeccably clean. I'm a stickler for random hairs etc lol. They had these awesome magnification mirrors in bathrooms lol
The jacuzzi was great for two people and our view of the strip and Mirage volcano was top notch. 
Cons: The ventilation system was meh. There were no fans in the bathrooms
The hotel applied a $300 security deposit to my bank cc. They slipped this by me somehow :\/ Apparently it's 'policy'. *eye roll* I was NOT happy to have $300 of MY money tied up while in Vegas. grrr

Mixed bag on the bed. The sheets were so soft, the pillows were perfect. It was like sleeping on a cloud. I liked it, my husband however did not, he needs a firmer bed.

WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE!
I booked Treasure Island Hotel through Orbitz from December 25-27 and had a horrific harassing experience with this hotel during my stay with my family. To make a long story short, my mom and I were staying in the hotel room, the hotel guests next to us started banging on our door and attempted aggressively to enter our room through the side door and front door. I had to call security various times in our hotel room during this time and my mother and I ended up having to file a written complaint, because of the severity of the matter. 
I have called Orbitz countless times in order to reach higher management and have been misguided and told someone will contact me within 24 hours, which is not done. It has been a week now since I have made the complaint to orbitz and TI, with no contact back. I am VERY unhappy with my experience with Treasure Island and Orbitz and TI lack of customer service due to the severity of the incident is insane. The hotel was very disrespectful and did not seem to care that we were at threat to our lives.",8,3,0

TI has some fun shows (Mystere by Cirque is really pretty funny and worth the money if you get a deal), but is lacking in the LV restaurant department.

I am a personal believer in the necessity of mirrors in bedrooms, and TI has never failed me there with floor to ceiling mirrors in the room; also, they have a people-mover from their hotel to The Mirage, which is only slightly better of a hotel.

If you're wondering whether to stay here or not, and your options are NYNY, Mandalay Bay, Luxor\/Excalibur or Trump, I say stay at TI... but if you're choosing between this and Imperial Palace, stay at the palace because you get THE BEST bang for your buck there.

I stay at TI most of the time that I come to Vegas and that is about twice a year.  On this stay, I stayed for free due to a 2 night comp offer from TI.  Score!  Not really....I'm starting to think I have a gambling problem.  I donated another $600 to this casino this trip and now i'm sad.  Oh, the things I could have bought.  

But why still the 4 stars?  Well, when you are a casino invited guest, you get to bypass the super long check in line...makes you feel pretty important.  The rooms are clean, beds are comfy and I like where the TI is located.  It's directly across from the Venetian\/Wynn...and I love the convenience of a tram that connects to the Mirage.  Saves you a cab ride and from there it's just a quick walk to the forum shops at the Cesaer and the always classy Bellagio hotel.  If you want to do some more shopping, there is a bridge that connects to the Fashion Show Mall too.  

There is a free show called ""Sirens of the TI"" outside of the hotel too.  It's basically a bunch of skimpy dressed girls that tempt a bunch of pirates onto their boat...with their singing and gyrating.  It's nothing spectacular, but hey it's free right?

The TI has a bunch of food choices to choose from too.  Gilley's recently opened up (bbq)...i'd pass on that.  I tried it and didn't think it was anything special and overpriced.  Oh, and they have the only pho on the strip...given it's nothing spectacular but when you have a hangover the next day, it's the best remedy.  If you want a quick bite, Francesca's just opened...it's a pizza joint.  You can grab a slice or a whole pie.  Of course, every hotel in Vegas has a buffet and so does the TI.  There's also a steak house, Kahunaville (island fare), Khotan (Japanese), and for you caffeine addicts, good old trusty starbucks.  

And of course, how can I leave out the gambling?  I like gambling here too...MOST of the dealers are nice and will help you out with advice if you aren't sure what to do.  There is a good variety of games-blackjack, roulette, baccarat, poker, pai gow poker, your usual slots or as i like to call them, ""sluts"" and craps.  There are a ton more but then this review will never end.

The room was pretty clean-- bed was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was nice, but they were very skimpy with the towels.

Casino leaves a lot to be desired. I didn't like hanging out here at all. The ceilings seem really low or something. I much preferred going across the street to the Palazzo or Venetian. One of the nicest things about TI is the location-- right in the middle of the strip.

Price was a little higher than usual because of the holiday weekend, but it wasn't outrageous. $25\/ day resort fee was reasonable I guess-- you get internet, gym, and some restaurant and drink coupons.

We ate at the buffet which was fine. Otherwise, we went elsewhere for food, drinking and gambling. Oh, by the way, there were a LOT of little kids there.

You'd think Las Vegas is immune to second hand smoke (I know its not just TI, but some of the other properties seem to get fresh air in better).  

Food at the coffe shop is mediocre at best, and the fabulous steak house was way overpriced and overblown.

Little Bit and I were just coming in quick to see ""Mystere"" and then bailing the next morning. I don't like Vegas so my ventures onto the strip are EXTREMELY limited. This trip I was solo and here for the Catersource Convention being held over at Ceasars Palace, so I went onto priceline (name your price) to get a hotel hopefully somewhere NEAR Caesars. I lucked out got a rate of $78.00 per night coming on a Sunday for 2 days. 

Rooms are nice be sure to tell them you do not want a room near the Pirate show if you would like to get some sleep... although I didn't hear the show to late in the evening, perhaps it is different in the summer time when they are busier. Service was fine nothing SPECTACULAR but check in was quick and friendly. Gift shop personnal smiling and nice, valet courteous. I had a view of the strip on a high floor it was nice but honestly you spend no TIME in your room so I don't imagine it is important when you really think about it. I could hear my neighbors from time to time so walls are thin (or neighbors were just loud) My classes during the convention were long starting at 7:00am and out by 6:15pm so needless to say I was not in the room for long. Last week the monorail that takes you to the Mirage was broken and they were offering a shuttle to the Mirage but my destination was Caesars so I took a cab each day.

FYI if you use credit cards in the cabs there is a $3.00 transacation fee. I did not partake of the pool but it is a nice size. I did not eat at any of the restaurants here this time so can't review those. Elevators are through the Casino like every other hotel in Las Vegas... as they want you to be tempted to loosen your pockets and ""give it a go""!LOL

This was booked through hotels.com, not sure what their guarantee policy means! Anyhow, the corridor leading to the room on 32nd floor smelled of dried vomit but at least when we got into the room it smelled clean.

Yes ladies and gentlemen the 80's are alive and well at the Treasure Island Hotel on the Vegas Strip.  I had recent occasion to go to Vegas for a trade show.  One of the recommended hotels for the show was ""TI"", a very modern twist of a name to a OLD hotel.  I booked a ""suite"" for my stay and was excited to get Vegas.  That was until I arrived at the hotel.  The first thing that struck me was the smell!  It just smelled odd.  Like someone was trying to use an air cleaner that was dirty....It reminded me faintly of the dog grooming area at Petsmart.  After checking in I hiked the equivalent of the ""batan death march"" to find my room.  Upon entry I was greeted by ""The Maid"" yes thats correct, they checked me into a room that was almost clean.  After saying hello, I did see a spectacular view of the strip.  I have to say it was something to see.  So once my friendly housekeep said goodbye (in a language I hadn't heard before) I set out to unpack.  The first thing that I noticed was the abundance of bathrooms.  The suite is advertised as 900 sqft of which at least 650 was bathrooms.  1 bathroom with a twin vanity and full sized jetted tub and walk in closet, Another with a twin vanity and full-sized shower for 2 complete with a bench to sit and rest on, if all the soaping and scrubbing becomes to much for you, and yes a half bath with another sink.  This place must have the single highest cost of SOAP of any hotel ever.  The furniture was straight 80's complete with multi-armed chrome lamp over what was a ""sofa pit"".  All the counter tops cabinets,night stands and vanities were covered in glass which did nothing to hide the fact that they were all scratched,scuffed and completely worn out.  the carpet was just slightly softer than sand paper, which is to say there was carpet.

I have to say, being of the 80's generation it was nice to see that vegas still can do ""throw back"" even if they weren't trying to!

       Upon arrival to Treasure Island hotel and Casino we waited for a bell hop to assist us with our bags. While he HELPED HIM load the bags onto the cart he did not say a single word to us. He did not say "" How was your drive?"" or "" Hello where are you guys coming from?"" or even ""Hello welcome to TI"". After the cart was loaded(that we helped him do) he wrote up our bell ticket and proceeded to ask several times "" do you need help with anything else"" in a demanding tone that was clearly suggesting that he wanted us to give him a tip. He then stated several more times in a even more demanding tone that "" I will not be the bell hop delivering your bags"". We said all right and thanked him and walked away. As walking away my party and I hear him yell at us "" WHY THANK YOU HAVE A GREAT DAY"" in the most sarcastic tone I have ever heard. In my experience I have always tipped the bell hop who delivers the bag(which we did with a generous 10 dollar tip). 
       We thought this would be a isolated incident, but while leaving your hotel we asked for bellhop assistance from our room. Once again we helped the bell hop load our bags onto the cart and before he left I THOUGHT EVEN THOUGH I USUALLY DO NOT to tip the bellhop who picked up the bags. AGAIN this bellhop did not say a single word to us until it was time for him to go. I gave him a two dollar tip just to avoid the same problem that we ran into. I gave him the money and he unfolded the bills and then scoffed at the money RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME AND ONCE AGAIN IN A INCREDIBLY SARCASTIC TONE SAID THANKS WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT ME WHILE WALKING AWAY. He gave off the impression that I was insulting him by giving him money. 
       The bell hop that assisted us with the car we tipped well again because that is how I have always tipped bell hops in las vegas( even at other hotels such as the Wynn, Encore, or Cosmopolitan). 
      I do not know if this is typical nor am I saying the entire bell service department acts this way, but with my current experience with them I would NOT want to stay at your hotel again. I do not enjoy feeling as if I did something wrong when in fact I am giving a person money for doing a service they are getting paid for already.

On a last minute decision to stay one extra night from our original planned trip, my boyfriend and I decided that it would be fun to Priceline a room and ended up at Treasure Island.  We left the hotel the next day as fiance\/fiancee and of course ever since then I have a super soft spot in my heart for this place.

Last weekend the girls and I stayed here since the rates were good.  The pool was a bit muggy and smelly, but we met some cool bachelor party attendees and the bartender was so funny and sweet.  Room service buffalo wings were amazing at 5 am and from a 5 cent machine I didn't know how to play, I won $16. Sweeeeeet!  The rooms are decent and comes with the necessities, but no mini-bar or fridge.  Beds are comfortable and the water pressure is good - nothing amazing about the rooms but nothing horrible.  The food here at the hotel are surprisingly good, too - from the room service, over to the buffet and even Isla was a pleasant find (yummy margaritas and SLIDERS were randomly memorable).

The one thing that I do love about here are the staff.  From the super friendly waiter I came across years ago at The Buffet to the bell desk, to housekeeping, and most recently, lost and found.  I was 95% sure I left my camera in our hotel room (4% sure it was hanging behind a bathroom door on the casino floor and a mere 1% that it might be on a slot machine).  I called L&F Monday morning and a sweet lady picked up.  She said there was nothing in the room reported as of yet but assured me that they still had a few bins to sort through.  She asked for my name and phone number and said she'd call me back in a few hours once they've gone through all the lost items. Feeling like dumba$$, I mentioned to her that there's a slight chance my camera might be on the casino floor or bathroom and she told me not to worry, she'd look for it outside of the room as well.  I get a call 20 minutes later and she asks me if I could identify some pictures on my camera: 2 weddings, 1 Yelp event (ha) and about a hundred Vegas pictures.  ""What color dresses did you and your friends wear?"" She asked. ""Pink, blue, silver and leopard!"" I said happily.  Making my day, she responded with, ""I found your camera!""  And it was that 1% - someone had found it in the casino. Ooops....

To make things even better, they have free UPS ground shipping in the continental US for lost items!  Thanks to the nice citizen who turned in a light pink Canon instead of stealing it and the responsiveness of the staff at TI, I'm getting something priceless returned to me.  Beautiful memories of my friends' weddings that I thought were lost are coming home to me along with the new ones from my Vegas trip.  Thank you, Treasure Island for your hardworking and understanding staff!  And thank you even more, to whoever turned in my camera.",6,4,6

Treasure Island pool has changed since I last was there two years ago.  T.I.'s pool used to be a semi-quiet and relaxing pool to hang out at to recoup from the night or morning before.   That's not the case anymore, well not for this past weekend (18th-20th Sep 09).  They had a DJ kicking out tunes which really set the tone for pool...party central.  And a party it was!  The pool area is small compared to other pools and was packed by 2 pm and turned into a floating dance floor with everyone grinding, drinking, and celebrating.  What were they celebrating?  There were bachelor, bachelorette, 21st birthday, and even divorce parties cutting lose.  There were guy and girl dance competitions, Hula Hoop contests, and other silly antics.  

I recommend for drinks to stick to bucks of beer (a.k.a buckets of beer) which have ice to keep them cold poolside (6 beers $42).  For mixed drinks I recommend the medium tube glasses at $18 each because the smaller cups ($9) melt too quickly and the yard sticks seemed bulky.  

If you are with a group I recommend reserving a cabana (#8) which will allow you a place to sun your buns and grab some shade when you need it.  There are two chairs and three lounge chairs with each cabana.  Plus your cabana comes with a flat LCD screen to watch some sports games.

Prices:
Monday - Thursday \/ $175.00
Friday - Sunday (except holidays) \/ $200.00
Half day prices may be available.

Cabana Times:
Daily \/ 9:00am - 6:00pm

This wasn't the Wet Republic (MGM Grand) but it was a GREAT time nevertheless!

Treasure Island Casino

Treasure Island casino is a GREAT place to stay on the strip.  Nice rooms, friendly staff, and great amenities (shows, gym, clubs, pool, and restaurants).  Somewhat centrally located and can get to most other attraction and casinos easily.  I would like to say it pays to be a player's club patron because the comps are excellent.  This stay 18th - 20th Sep my room was free, received $355 in player's reward cash (slots), VIP club passes, and was offered buy one get one free mystique show tickets.

The downside of this was in the terms of the gambling.  I used the $355 in player's reward cash (slots) to win a little over $200 in actual cash.  I blew through that and my original $50 in less than 40 minutes.  I went to several different machines of different bets (.25, .50, and $1) and could not get more than cherries (6 credits) or odd combination bars (15 credits).  So I quit for the night.  The next evening I tried again and blew $60 just as fast.  

Yes I know slots are casino's bread and butter and you'll lose 9 times out of ten, but I normally will play for several hours going back and forth winning and losing and having fun and slowly putting more money in as I go.  But the slots were tighter than a frog's watertight ass.  Last time I was here I saw individuals winning $10k, $2.5K, and $1.2k, not  a single person I saw won.  This time I saw a guy get up from a slot machine and reminded him his player's card was in the machine and he said they can keep it along with his money (ouch).  Like him I wasn't having fun so I didn't gamble.  I normally blow $900+ a trip but only lost $110 of my own cash.  Actually came back with $1.4K of the $1.6K I brought.

So stick to the tables or hang out at the pool (that is what I did 6 hours a day).",2,1,1

I've tried pho in many other cities and my mantra regarding pho is, ""how could you mess pho?"" I certainly wasn't disappointed yet I was expecting the worst from a place in Treasure Island that had a picture of a coffee cup as their logo. I certainly was put in my place when a huge bowl of noodles piled high with scallops, shrimps, fish cakes and fish balls were presented.

I wish I could go to Vegas just for that bowl of Pho. I'm kind of ashamed of liking the Pho there more than the Pho I've had in L.A. and Chicago yet at the same time, I wish I could find that intense flavor anywhere in California. I ordered a small bowl of the seafood pho since I can't have too much beef in my diet and the size of it blew me away. Not only was the seafood cooked to near perfection, there were various amounts of hot sauce and a mountain of bean sprouts, basil, cilantro, limes and jalapenos. Delicious.

I brought my kids to see the Jabawokeez, as it was my daughters birthday wish so we booked a room at TI. Check in was a bit lengthy as only 3 of the 8 hotel employees behind the desk were helping guests. However,  the gentleman who helped check us in was very pleasant and helpful. The room was clean. The beds were comfy and the pillows are great. I really liked that each set of elevators went to a set number of floors.  We hardly had any wait times and they were never packed. The maids were very sweet.  Each time we passed them they would kindly greet us.There is a CVS attached to the hotel, which was convenient.  Go there to buy water and drinks.  The prices are higher than a normal CVS but cheaper than the vending machines and bars. 

The main issue I had is that this is not a kid friendly hotel. 
There aren't many restaurants. The restaurant prices are outrageous.  Do yourself a favor and go somewhere  else to eat. 
The pool was full of beer and beer guzzling 40 somethings.  They were spraying each other and having a great time...normally I would not care but there were kids in the pool  (not just mine). The lifeguards and pool attendants didn't care.  I called down to the front desk and inquired about the normalcy of having beer dumped into their pool.  They didn't have an answer.  There is very little shade and not much deck room.  The lounge chairs were clean and comfy. The pool looked nice.  It's very shallow and quite small,  especially for such a large hotel. There are a lot of cabanas. The jacuzzi looked more like a little tikes play zone. Luckily it was barley luke warm.  TV channels are limited and spotty, but the tv was a good size. 
The bath towels were a bit rough but they were clean. The bathroom is a good size,  lots of counter space. The tub is deep and roomy. There is no fan in the bathroom and the door must be manually shut or it will swing back at you. It is quietly ventilated. There is a blow dryer hiding in the closet with the mini fridge and ironing board.

This time around I made reservations for my 25th birthday at Treasure Island, or now known as TI. Let me break down as much as I can remember.

Overall atmosphere:
Great layout with alot of traffic because of the Cirque de Soleil show and other stuff going on here. TI did a great job reeling in the 21-35 guests with the renovation.

Rooms:
The only downside was our room was on the very far end of the hallway but the rooms were very nice with a great view of the Sirens of TI show \/ strip. You cant beat the flat panel TV for your television viewing needs. If you have an IPOD you can dock your music device here! Score! Newly remodeled rooms make you wonder how it looked before?

Casino:
I played alot of blackjack here but they had $5 tables early in the morning but slowly moved to $25 min tables as the evening progressed. Their poker room is a bit confusing because of the size and waitlist setup. I never had a chance to bluff  :)

Buffet:
This place reminded me of an Asian themed buffet, maybe because of the atmosphere. We ate at this place twice. Once for lunch and once for dinner. They have a pasta station, salad station with people making salads for you, BBQ (ribs, brisket, pulled pork), Asian station, Sushi, and a pretty nice selection of desserts. I love eclairs. They had Kalbi steak and pre cut snow crab legs. For $26 the crab legs better be sliced in half!

Customer Service:
This is always a big thing for return business and TI did a great job with it. Short lines checking in and out. During check in the check in lady told me my card would be charged the room rates again even though it was all paid upfront. She had to call a supervisor by and squared things away.

Location:
Location, Location, Location is what its all about now in Vegas. Why stay at the Palms when you only have the Rio next to you. Its all about staying in the middle of the strip. People watching at its best. Across the street from the Venitian and down the street from the Wynn and The Mirage. The only downside is the monorail doesnt stop at TI, you have to go to Imperial Palace and walk through to the monorail. 

Room rates were affordable, I will definitly stay here next time in March!

Overall, not a bad place to stay though for the price.  The $22\/day  ""resort fee"" tacked onto the normal room rate is a joke though. It's bad enough to have to pay separately for amenity's like internet or health club on a as-needed basis, but their ""Resort Fee"" is mandatory. You pay for these services whether you use them or not... 

So... An OK hotel, but we'll stay at one of the nicer\/newer ones next time...",1,0,0

This was our first time in Vegas, so we didn't really know what to expect, especially since we got a wicked deal through Southwest Vacations - I think it was like $315\/person for a roundtrip flight and 3 nights. Ummm yeah. That's pretty damn cheap. 

In all honesty, I booked it because a friend of mine tipped me off to the fact they recently remodeled, and for that price I just couldn't pass it up. I was still expecting something akin to maybe a Best Western - which this CERTAINLY was not. 

I already knew about the resort fee, so that didn't really bother me. Since it was my birthday, the guy at the front desk tried to get us a nice room even though we has booked just the basic. We ended up on the 35th floor (second from the top) with a pretty sweet effin' view. 

Check-in wasn't too bad, we waited maybe 10 minutes even though the line was long. They had about 7 or 8 people working the desk so it went pretty quickly. 

Didn't order any food from room service, but requested more hangers and pillows and they were brought up pretty quickly.

Unfortunately I can't comment on the maid service...the bf kept the 'privacy please' thing on the whole time because the new laptop that he had just bought wouldn't fit in the safe and he was convinced someone would steal it. Le sigh. 

We hung out by the pool one afternoon, got some ridiculously overpriced drinks, and chilled out in the water for a bit. Even in the 104 degree heat, that pool was ICE COLD. A bit of a shock at first, but much better than the alternative (we're from Texas and in the summer most pools are like bathwater...nasty). I think we got some wings at some point and I remember them being fine...but I was also a little buzzed at the time, so take that for what it's worth. They were reasonably priced though...maybe like $8 or $9 for 10 or 12 wings, pretty normal. 

The bed is SOOOOO comfy. Honestly, that was the only thing I really cared about, considering that I was sleeping in every day and have a tendency to wake up with pretty bad neck and back pain - which never happened. Hooray. 

All in all, I'd definitely stay here again. Not sure I would pay upwards of $100 a night for a basic room, but I am kind of a package-deal vacation girl anyway, so hopefully I'll score another winner like the one we did this time.",3,0,0

Their per day hotel fee includes free WIFI for two devices and anything over two you will get charged. So when you get on line a box pops up and ask you too activate that device and agree to the terms per room # and name. So this tracks the number of IP address per 24hrs and which room.

Well we check out using the TV and I noticed we got charged per day for the WIFI. So I call to the front desk and told them about it, she said her manager had to run an IP check to see how many devices where running per day. Well out of the three days that took off two days, but the third day they would not.  I asked them why, she said I had 3 devices using the wifi. I told her thats untrue, we only had one device that sign the terms. She got all nasty with me and told me ""this time we will take it off, but next time you will be charged"" I asked her why I being charged for using 3 devices when only one agree to the terms. She hung up on me.

Fuck that BS!! Sorry you just lost a customer. Is that how you treat your customers? I feel so sorry for your other employees because they were over the top. But this coming from the front desk is wrong. 

So after driving 6 hours back to AZ I was thinking about this and only two things came to mind on how they said we had 3 devices. One is someone hack in and used our info and the 2nd is the hotel is scanning the rooms and once it see a device sign the terms it auto activates any devices that can use an WIFI without agreeing to the terms per device.

We parked in the structure and had a hard time looking for the lobby... They need better signs\/ direction cues... Don't lug your baggages around if you dont know where you're going, your shoulder is going to HURT!
They charged us for resort fee eventhough we said we won't need any of their services... COME ON! 25 a night for nothing?! This is my least favorite part about TI.

Room service is quick, they promptly bought me my hairdryer when my room is missing one. The halls were fairly quiet. The binds are DARK so you won't even notice the sun rises (this can be both good and bad...)

However, with one of my best friends getting married, and some groomsmen getting the stereotypical idea of going to Vegas for a bachelor party (and me shaking my head in disapproval,) all those memories are rushing back to my conscious... and it REALLY makes me want to write a review.

Honestly, I really wanted to do a review on JUST the Strip itself because I just want to bitch about the Strip. It just doesn't look like it's possible. If I can write a review on the Mission, how come I can't write one about one goddamn street? I digress. I'll still bitch about the Strip, but also give a fair review of Treasure Island.

So my friend was leaving for Peace Core service and he wanted to go on one last road trip. Oh, if only I could give a review about THAT trip. I guess that's what regular blogs are for. Whatever. So he wanted to go to Vegas because he had never gone. And since I never went, I was curious and agreed to go. Our partner in crime... er... road trips... was also interested, but he brought along his girlfriend at the time. Great... yeah... that's what you do. Invite your girlfriend on a guys' road trip to Vegas. Your girlfriend that you just got with two weeks ago and never really established herself within the group so that we could all get use to her. Great. I digress... again.

So I looked online, and after looking at the Luxor and some other hotels, we all agreed that TI was the best deal... and viewing the other hotels that we might have gone to and walking around inside, I'm really glad we went with TI.

We finally get there... the free parking lot was pretty far away from the reception desk and it was really confusing as to whether we could park there before we check in or whatever. The person that I talked to for my room was pretty rude... some middle aged woman. We had to walk through the distracting lights and sounds of the casino to get to the elevators to our hotel room. I could care less about gambling (I only bet a dollar or two, lost, and never looked back at the machines.)

The most important part of a hotel -- the room -- was very satisfactory. The beds were REALLY comfortable. The bathrooms were relatively clean and very spacious. The view from whatever floor we were on was breathtaking (for like a second) and showed a great deal of the southern part of the Strip.

The restaurants within the place are a bit overpriced. But I guess one would expect that from a tourist trap. The banquet had tons of food... it felt like a cafeteria... an overpriced cafeteria. I know that's the purpose of an all-you-can-eat place... I just kinda have a problem with ""all-you-can-eat."" By paying such a hefty price to get inside, you feel obligated to get tons of shit, even to the point where you should stop eating... I guess that's why there's tons of obese people in Vegas. Once again, I digress.

Their fancy shmancy pirate getup outside their hotel was closed either for renovations or repair or whatever. I didn't mind all that much since I didn't stay there for that anyway.

So why 3 stars instead of 4? Because Yelp won't let me give fractions of a star. It's more of a 3.5, but I really don't think it deserves a 4. Rude receptionists and overpriced eateries ruin it for me. It definitely deserves credit for being a cheap alternative to the over-the-top hotel\/casinos that inhabit the Strip without totally sacrificing quality. I was inside Excalbur and the Luxor, and I'm just glad I didn't go with those casinos.... something about them just didn't feel right.

Personally, I just don't like the Strip. Maybe the rest of Vegas ain't that bad. But just walking around the Strip makes me feel surrounded by cigarette smoke and desperation. And bad body odor. Sin City is a very alluring nickname, since I'm the exact opposite of being overly religious and conservative, and have my own vices just like everyone else who comes here. It's just that my vices can be taken care of without having to go here and not feeling totally shitty after spending a day or two in it. And smelling like cigarette smoke. To me, it's just all  overrated. If I wanted to get drunk or gamble my money away or have a cute chick bounce on my lap and show off her goods, I can do it for WAY cheaper here in the Bay Area without having to deal with desert heat.

So if you're easily distracted by pretty lights and bodies and fancy drinks and want to waste a whole bunch of money, and you say, ""Hey, Vegas has exactly all of that!"" then TI is a great hotel to stay at. It's nearly not as pricey as the other hotels (and seriously, you're not going to be in your hotels for the majority of the trip), the beds are comfortable, and it's not too far away from other hotel\/casinos or bars or strip clubs, if you're into those things. And if the groomsmen force me to go to Vegas... which they better fucking not... then I'm going to suggest going to TI. Otherwise, I probably won't come here again.",1,0,0

It was kind of like stepping into a different world for a bit with the Caribbean style village, the gas lamps, and the splashing of the bay.  There were more family oriented things to do as well. Themes seem to be gone now on the strip.  Things like the MGM theme park which used to be behind the MGM Grand Hotel and the pirate themes have been demolished to make way for money making retail spaces.

Everything looks updated.  Well, except for the the LCD television.  I'm pretty sure we had a 20"" in the room and it was laughable.  Did you ever see the episode of The Office where Michael invites members of the office to his home for dinner?  Remember the ""flat-screen"" that Jan let him buy?

Yeah.

Another downer is the cigarette smoke-scented casino floor.  I don't know if the casino was part of the make-over or not, but what I do know is that the aroma of smoke is thick enough to linger on your clothes for an hour or so.

The newer casinos don't have this problem.  Perhaps they have better ventilation or maybe there hasn't been enough time for the smoke to saturate every square inch of the casino.  In any case, if you're a classy individual, steer clear of the casino at TI.

But the rooms are great...",2,1,2

I argued to not charge me for Fridays check in since I actually made it in at midnight. They said no, I was tired and didn't feel like starting a fight, plus the line was getting longer by the minute. 

Once I made it up to my room, the AC was off. There were no lights turned on and I kinda got a bit scared to walk in. Lol 
I had a view, the view of the Encore and Wynn which was a plus. I did not enjoy resort fee!! If I knew that, I would have stayed somewhere else. 

I tried the Pho place in TI. I was a bit wasted and didn't finish my food. But I do remember spending $22 bucks for a bowl of soup and 4 pieces of egg rolls. I can get 2 bowls of soup and egg rolls for a cheaper price in San Diego. But I guess it came with it being in a hotel.

The second strike is when the bell hop arrived with our luggage and one of the pieces was missing....I guess they gave it to a different room and I had to wait another 45 minutes for it to be found.

The rooms have been remodeled with dark wood furniture and looks very contemporary especially with a flat screen tv. The bed itself was just fine with it not being too hard or soft. The only part I wish they could have changed was the shower heads as they looked old, but did have decent pressure.

Our check-in process was fairly quick and just took about 10 minutes to get through the line and get our room keys. They also went through all of the discounts we got  booking online on the TI website. We had gotten 2 for 1 buffet, 2 for 1 spa and 2 for 1 drinks at Gilley's.

I actually haven't been back to Treasure Island since they ended the show. It was kinda like my ""official"" boycott because they canceled it. But, since I wanted my wife to see the casino we came to visit.

I stayed in this hotel many years ago. Going to that show was a ritual every time I came to Las Vegas. It brought me to the casino and the Treasure Island clubs. When I came I spent money. I would come early and play Blackjack for a while then go to the club for a drink. When it got closer to the time the show would start I would go to the outside bar get a beer then get an up front spot. Needed to get there early because  it would get crowded. It was free, how kool is that. I know several people that said because the pirate show was so good they went to shows at Treasure Island. Sometimes things should just be left alone. I'm sure it was a very expensive production. But I'm sure the hotel and casino made more than enough to cover it. I understand the retail aspect for the change but couldn't something else have been done?

Haven't stayed here in a while but I checked the prices, and for the location and this casino is in a great location on the strip, it's seems to be a good value.

Pool: Nice pool, glad to say there weren't a bunch of screaming kids. There were plenty of chairs and the pool was a decent size. They had some hip hop music playing and a bar.

Within 2 hours of our stay of 3 days and 2 nights, we decided to eat at the buffet. The food was okay at best but it made my boyfriend, friend, and I sick after about two hours later. Two hours after that we all started throwing up. We spent the first night holed up in our rooms throwing our guts up and with shivers. Even setting the temperature at max wouldn't keep us feeling warm. We all decided to not go to the hospital because we don't want to add a $1000+ bill on to our already horrible night. The second night we opted to just walk around instead of doing the fun things we intended to do (zip lining, drinking, nightclubs) because our stomachs were still in really bad shape. We complained when we checked out. They made it hard to complain. We went to talk to the manager at the check in and she told us to talk to the manager of the buffet. After 15 minutes of waiting for the buffet manager, that manager told us that we have to go back to the front and complain to a security guard which doesn't make much sense. After waiting another 10 minutes to get in contact with a security guard he began the process to report the problem. The security guard was nice and heard us out about our problem. He explained in detail what the follow up steps were and was about the only pleasurable experience at our stay in treasure island. We could not get at the very least our hotel fee back. We have to reply to an email sent to us about 6 days later to call a number where they told us we could only get our fee back after they mailed us something where we would have to fill out and send back. At no time did we ever feel like they genuinely care about our horrible stay there and made it so complicated to get at the very minimum of compensation for being poisoned. This trip was made to allow my boyfriend to go to Vegas for the first time as a 21 yr old before he went to basic training for the Air Force. It was all ruined and who knows when he will be able to go again. Weeks later our stomachs are still recovering and we are still working on the process to get our hotel fee back.

The room itself was very nice. It was just me and my 8 yr old this trip, so we had lots of room in our 2 queen bed room.  The beds were comfy, pillows were soft, and the AC was nice and cold. Everything was crisp and clean. 

Yes, the casino has a funky smell.  The pool was fun but a bit crowded. Personally, I did not care for the DJ with the crummy sound system, but oh well. 

What else.... Ummmmm....GREAT location, close to Venetian, Mirage, Mall, Walgreens (we went there several times!!)  Self park was very easy. Not a long walk at all.

We stayed here because we were coming in Friday midnight and got a cheap rate on hotwire and wanted to save money since we got the Palazzo for Saturday night. As we got in it seemed like hip hop night at the bar (gilleys I think ) and lots of rougher people around as we walked towards registration. Actually the next day was also rougher crowd. Not as bad a circus circus though.
We got a suite and it was HUGE! but the decor was very dated. 90's almost cheesy! with reddish marble in the bathrooms. (there were 2) and those alien looking lamps, the ones were its springs into 5 different bulbs hanging over the sofa. Also, it didn't feel completely clean. The tub felt gritty, like maybe they didn't wash the ajax off and saw grime on the handles. The lights were so dim that I couldn't examine everything else completely. I know it's an older hotel so I wasn't expecting anything fancy and we just used it to sleep. I wouldn't stay here if you plan to spend a lot of time in your room. 
It's just way different than when I started coming here as a child back when it used to be kid friendly with the arcade and pirate show. I remember coming here when they had social house sushi and celebs were dining maybe 10 years ago and it's just gone downhill. This is a cheap decent hotel in the middle of the action.

When we returned at 3am the TVs weren't working and it was an hour wait for room service to bring up our ""complementary champagne"" (whatevs no biggy) but they decided to send the maintenance man up too and he stayed in the room for over an hr just to tell us we could change to another took at that point. Same type of room we had before... (NOT THE CASE AT ALL) ceiling was a lot lower AND to make matters worse the TV wasn't working AGAIN! So we called to kindly ask if we could have another bottle of champagne for our troubles and were told ""NO"" by Earl at the front desk. He was very rude. At that point i asked to speak with a manager at which point I was told he'd be in in about 10 minutes. I walked down to speak with Edgar one of the assistant managers and he was not much help. He offered to give us back some of our upgrade fees and get us back into a comparable room that we had the previous night. He also found that Earl had given the okay for the extra bottle of champagne (I'm not psychic how i was supposed to know especially after he blatantly said NO). Also, Edgar had a very condescending nature to him and actually laughed at us while my boyfriend and I were expressing our frustrations (HOW UNPROFESSIONAL!)Finally got up to our new room Friday morning at about 8am which was a very nice room but I was still super upset about everything I had to go through the last few days. It was just one hiccup after another and now I come to find out my boyfriend had planned to propose there but that he didn't feel it was the right time and honestly it wasn't I was in a horrible mood, we were celebrating our anniversary and they just don't even care. I am so upset at how the trip went it was my original plan to bring my boyfriend out for vacation but little did I know he wanted to propose and now I'm just so angry. That would have been such a pivotal point in my life and I've always wanted to do that in Vegas. Moral of the story....

Upon arrival the first thing I noticed was the overwhelming scent of Mold in the lobby. I assume this is because of all the water around or in the building. 

Once I checked in, I noticed that although they upsell the beds on the website, they're nothing to write home about.  but there were a variety of different types of pillows so at least there's that.  I was also disappointed to find no tea\/coffee maker in the room, this made me sad as the coffee or tea in the eateries was $4.00  One thing I did notice is that the glasses that you get beside your sink.. they were pretty gross looking, so I didn't use them.  I've watched too many shows where they show how they're 'cleaned'.

The rooms themselves were large, well appointed, and if they were non-smoking, they truly were non-smoking.  No hint of a smoker being in the room.  The bath tub was a large soaking tub. Not a HUGE one, but large enough that I could soak comfortably, and let me tell you, I NEEDED it after walking every day. 

The casino was your typical casino, filled with smoke (YUCK) though the air handlers did a good job of getting rid of a lot of it. The eateries: The coffee shop\/Pho, The buffet and Phil's were all nicely appointed and decently priced. I was able to eat and not go broke, even if I was determined to put it all in the slots. ;)

My best friend and I did a package deal airfare and hotel and this hotel fit the bill. I read the mixed reviews but I also read mixed reviews for other hotels too so decidee to check it out for myself.   
We arrived late Friday around 12am, our flight was delayed 45 min.  Since it was my birthday weekend and my first time there I wanted a great view. The great view comes at an extra cost, of course. I was going to pay but my best friend talked me out of it. The guy at the front desk said he coukd get us a view of the Venetian at no charge. I was fine with that. When we got to our room it was a view of the Trump tower. I was so tired and didnt want to fuss we just stayed in the room. They also gave us some champagne for my bday so not too bad. 

I inspected the room as I would in any hotel for bugs, bed bugs roaches etc.. I found no trace of either. Everything was clean and there was no smell of cigarette. We were on the 31st floor. One thing I do like in a hotel bathroom is when the sink is separate from the toilet and shower. It makes it easier for multiple people to get ready. This is an older hotel so I get that they strutured their bathrooms back in the day. 

So, this hotel in ny opinion is not centrally located. Its Towards the end if not the end of the strip if you dont count circus circus and the stratosphere which is much further up. I would not say TI is centrally located. I found it to be further away from everything. 

It's not a bad hotel if you just need somewhere basic to stay, nothing fancy. The beds are reasonably comfy and the decor seems to have been updated within the last 5 years?  A good stay with no issues. I do wish I took photos of our room but wanted to get the birthday weekend started and I forgot.

SHOWS: 4.5 stars

- stayed on the highest level floor which means = high ceilings
- NO robes, but they did have  a safe\/hair dryer\/iron + board

CASINO: 3 stars
The casino is just OK, it is kind of aging and old looking now. 

FOOD: 2 stars
The food choices are very minimal, and everything was just OK. Treasure Island has no fine dining choices or high-end restaurants.

So overall, TI gets a high 3 star (close to 3.5 should be more accurate). The overall appeal of the hotel on the outside still holds well, and the location is settled right on the strip next to Mirage and across from Palazzo\/Venetian; the rooms are extremely renovated.

I arrived here for a conference and moved the line quickly at check-in.  The gal wasn't overly curt but she wasn't very friendly.  The hotel is trapped between its 90's ""bring the kids"" past (the way I remember it as a kid) and the need to modernize and shed its tackiness-something I don't envy them trying to do.  In the end, it doesn't work, its still tacky with a pseudo modern veneer that doesn't mix, so I don't recommend spending a ton of time in the casino if you are staying here.

Pros: the room was spacious, clean, and mostly exceeded my expectations.  The bed was nice, and the restroom was spacious and had great bath and countertops.

Cons: views are hit or miss, the walls are thin so you will hear noise, the casino is very smokey and not that hip, no in-room coffee machines, the tv is small, and the hotel rooms don't have power outlets that you can find without a treasure map of your own, which despite the name of the hotel, they do not provide.",4,4,2

Lot of counterspace for makeup and hair supplies. One complaint though. I was in the middle of a shower and the water suddenly went super cold! What is that all about?

I like how they spit the elevators so that if you were on the top floors, you don't have to stop at all the lower one before reaching yours. We had a really good view of the strip and it was walking distance to a lot of the places we went to.

""If it were possible to give this establishment   a 0 I would. I would never recommend this establishment for a nights stay, trip to the casino or the circ du soleil mystere show. I am appalled by how I was treated by the ticket manager of the box office Justin Hawker. During the show my family and I purchased a box of popcorn to enjoy. As the show began one of the circ du soleil mystere performers stuck his hand in our bucket of popcorn. I understand this was probably fun and games so we waited till after the show to ask for a refund because we no longer wanted the popcorn after this happen. We were told at the refreshment  stand to talk to the supervision (Justin). When we explained the situation Justin stated the performers don't do things like that. He had a rude tone and stated the best he could do was give us another bucket of popcorn. We again asked for a refund because the show was over and we had no need to take a bucket of popcorn home with us. Justin then stated he would not give us a refund and that we had to call circ du soleil directly to ask for a refund. When asked for that phone number he stated he didn't know. When asked for further clarification related to why we could not get a number to contact them, Justin became even more rude and dismissive. He acted very unprofessional stating he didn't have to give us an explanation and to get out of the theater because another show was stating. When asked for his supervisor he refused to give us a name stating that he was the supervisor. He then told other staff to call security because we were trying to argue,fight, and were threatening him. I was shocked and appalled at these lies he told! He caused a huge scene when we were trying ask him questions. I have never felt so disrespected and embarrassed in my life! He exemplified a horrible way to treat guests of Treasure Island. I will NEVER again go to this establishment. This situation was un called for and could have been avoided if Justin acted more like a professional. What a terrible way to treat guests!

We were all on a budget, and wanted to go to the Wynn nightclubs, so this hotel was in the perfect location.  Because of its proximity to Fashion Show Mall, we were also able to eat a few cheap meals (Chipotle and Grimaldi's) and do some shopping at the giant F21.  We saved a lot on cab fare from walking back and forth from the Wynn\/Encore as well.  

The room was very clean and spacious, even for four of us.  The beds are comfy, and the bathroom was clean and had a big mirror (essential for us ladies), although it could use a vent or fan.  For the price, we didn't expect stellar service or a beautiful interior, and we strategically didn't hang out in the casino or hotel itself for very long, opting instead to explore the nicer nearby hotels.  Housekeeping was very nice about bringing us extra towels, and our room was close to the elevators and the ice machine, so the room was perfect for our needs.  The casino and common areas were very smoky, but surprisingly our room itself was completely free of that gross smoke smell, which was great because I can't stand smoke.  

The only low point was when we requested a wine and beer bottle opener and had to pay $5 for it, only to realize they only brought us a wine bottle opener.  I had to call several times and wait on hold to correct the situation, but this was just a minor incident.  

We did eat at the Coffee Shop in the lobby one morning when we were too tired and hungover to venture out, and it was not great, but not bad (greasy breakfast food that did the job).

 The Resort Fee

 I'm not sure how much longer this will be legal but for now, TI thinks it's ok to advertise a price for booking, and then when you check in, say you owe them $25 extra a night as a ""resort fee"". They say it's a great deal, you get free local calls, a newspaper, a 2 for 1 drink coupon, and you can print your boarding passes free in the lobby. This charge is NOT optional, even if you don't use what they force on you. 

 It's seriously the bait and switch scam. If TI wants $25 extra a night, it needs to add it to the base rate that is ADVERTISED.

 The only reason I'm not rating TI a 1-star is because they are not the only place in Vegas that does this, but they are one of the most expensive. 

 Other strikes are: The bars are overpriced and lacking in fun. Restaurants are twice as much as an off-strip option. The pool is a little small.",3,1,1

From here, I walked to the Fashion Show Mall, the Wynn, the Venetian, etc

On a Sat afternoon, the front desk had a long line but it went pretty quick.  Vdrana? (lady from Bosnia)from the Front desk staff was very pleasant. Even though they didn't have any king rooms or strip view, she did give me a renovated room on a high floor with view of the back of the hotel which was not bad.  She was also nice enough to offer an amenity for my bday!

The room was nice and clean. It has a safe and mini fridge in the closet. Bathroom has one sink but a big counter to lay all your toiletries on.

The hotel also has a spa, fitness center and a great variety of restaurants: pizzeria, buffet, steakhouse with happy hour ($7 cocktails and flatbreads), señor frogs, kahunaville (which has a tahitian show and latin nights on saturdays), a saloon, frozen yogurt, etc.  During our stay, we got to try the Happy Hour at the steakhouse which was pretty good and used our 2 for 1 voucher that they give you upon check in for the buffet and that was unfortunately very bad (see separate review).  

I also checked out their pool which was a bit small but nice with cabanas and music.

I was a little apprehensive about security due to previous reviews but felt safe especially because they had security guards checking room keys by the elevators.

The hotel is not as giant as some of others, so it isn't overwhelming to walk around. The rooms were pretty clean and really big - especially the bathrooms (though the shower heads could be replaced with nicer ones). Beds were comfortable and had nice blankets and sheets. We even had a nice view of the strip and the pool. I thought the rooms were just as nice as they looked in photos. Price was unbeatable. Lines to check in weren't too bad either. Not too many kids, hotel felt safe as they check your room key prior to entering the elevator areas. Seemed to have a decent amount of machines for gambling. CVS inside the hotel too nice a nice plus. Pool area was also very pleasant - though the DJ came on at noon and was way too loud for an older crowd so we left the pool area. Nice that they have a tram that goes from TI to the Mirage. 
The biggest \/ main con to staying at this hotel is the SMELL. It was SO smokey. The vents in the hotel ceiling were black. They need a better ventilation system for the smoke.

Disclaimer: This is a true story. I did not leave out any facts and I have no personal bias against TI. I've been Yelping since 2011 and rarely do I write a scathing review unless I think something unreasonable happened that the public should know.

The day after we made our reservation, the room rates went down. So we called to find out whether TI does price adjustment, and if not whether cancellation was possible.

We called around 1:00 AM and apparently the reservation department was closed, so we got transferred to the front desk. Some guy picked up. He sounded like a young guy in his early 20s and annoyed. (I will not give out his name out of respect for his personal privacy, but TI should know who worked the 1:00 AM shift this day if they really wanted to find out.) We called and gave him our reservation number. He pulled up our account. We asked him if price adjustment was possible and if not, if we are eligible to cancel our reservation. He paused for a few seconds and said,

""It's been canceled."" and hung up the phone. 

Let me repeat this in case you didn't catch it the first time. He hung up on us. This entire conversation with him took place within 1 minute. If you are wondering whether we were unreasonable or rude on our part, I assure you we were not. We couldn't have pissed him off in 1 minute. We called, asked the question, and after several seconds, got the hung up.

I was sort of in disbelief\/shock for a good several minutes about what just happened. I texted my friends who had been to TI to ask if their customer service was this rude. They said no, and that guest services are usually friendly and accommodating, and that this kind of treatment usually never happens in ANY Vegas hotels.

About an hour later I found out that the show tickets we bought as a package deal would cost us cancellation fees. So we called back to reactivate the reservation. The same guy picked up. He said, ""ok so you only canceled about an hour ago... and you still wanna come in on X day?"" I said politely as possible, fearing he might put us in some crappy room, ""Yes please. Thank you.""

He said, ""Ok I'll note it... (pause)... bye."" and hung up the phone before I hung up.
I checked my reservation about half an hour and it was still canceled. It was 2:30 AM by then so I went to bed to check the next day.

I checked this morning for my reservation. IT WAS STILL CANCELED. This guy never followed through with the ""note."" I had to call the reservation department to reinstate it.

So there you have it. I understand that this guy might had a bad day but he is still representing someone else's business\/livelihood. He has to work with some level of professionalism. I don't understand how TI management does not review employee phone calls and how they can let these rogue employee be the face of the hotel. At this point, my only prayer is that I won't be stuck in some crappy room in retaliation and I won't be further harassed during my stay with inconveniences.",6,2,0

1) It's literally across the street from the Fashion Show Mall, if you're a girl (although this may apply to some guys), you'll appreciate not having to trek down the hot ass strip to buy some extra accessories, last-minute shoes, or a new outfit altogether before going out that night. Total score! And also, if you don't want to spend hoards of money on food, you can enjoy the mall's Food Court and all it has to offer.

2) It's adjacent to many of the hottest nightclubs: XS, Tryst, Surrender, TAO, LAVO, JET, Pure etc. Yes, you have to take a cab to Marquee, but that's only one club compared to the handful that are within walking distance from the TI.

3) The rooms are comfortable and housekeeping was friendly [unlike some housekeepers that give extreme attitude]. 

4) There's a Walgreens across the street. I can't even begin to tell you how many times we walked over there for crap that we forgot to pack. Total score #2!

Why the TI is 1 star short from the full 5:

1) Our room was right above the stunt show that they perform 100x a day between the hours of 10AM-12AM (I'm making those times up), but that doesn't matter, what matters is how NOISY and obnoxious it was to be awoken by gunfire, bellowing, and splashes everyday! UGH.

We liked that fact that TI isn't one of those behemoth hotels that requires a 20 minute hike to get to your room.  Plus, rooms were recently remodeled and our deal came with two free buffets.

At check in, we were told our room had a resort view (i.e., overlooking the pool).  While technically true, we ended up with a great view of the Strip, looking south.  We were also given a buy one get one free buffet coupon for a weekday lunch or dinner.

Our room was obviously fairly new, with lots of dark wood and a modern design.  We were especially impressed with how large the bathroom was.  The carpet was a busy pattern designed to hide dirt, but closer inspection revealed a carpet in serious need of steam cleaning.  There were lots of stains.  The rooms also aren't very soundproof and you might consider bringing earplugs to block out the noise of late night revelers and slamming doors in the wee hours.

TI has a great selection of in-house restaurants.  The buffet space is also recently remodeled and very attractive.  We used our freebie coupon for dinner and enjoyed an expansive buffet with a Southern themed menu for the main section - bbq, sweet potatoes, greens and chicken fried steak were all passable.  It was supplemented with a pasta performance station, baked potato bar, a basic sampling of Chinese food, some Mediterranean appetizers and sushi.  The best part was the made to order salad station and the dessert buffet.  Do not pass up the mini donuts with caramel icing that have been warmed under a heat lamp!  Or the chocolate dipped strawberries!  We were surprised, and disappointed, to find the exact same menu a couple of days later at lunch, with the exception of the baked potato bar which had been replaced by out of the box frozen seafood selections.

Canter's Deli was incredible, offering large portions of delicious fare at affordable prices.  Think typical Jewish deli.

The casino was a bit smaller than other resorts on the strip, but we liked this because it was easy to navigate, and less crowded. There are a few resaurants and several cool bars here as well. We didnt go to Gilleys (the country bar) but definitely want to check it out on our next trip. Kahunaville bar was cheesy, but the buy one get one drink specials and bartenders doing tricks made it worth stopping into for a drink or two.

If I decided not to ball out on a trip to Vegas this and Paris would be my two places that I would love to stay. The hotel itself is classy but has a nice atmosphere that's half themed, half not. The pirates show in the front is a nice little touch about five times a night and the casino is quite a happening place despite the fact that when I was here I did not find any $5 tables ... although the economy may have changed that recently. 

The rooms have sort of a grey-ish theme to them and the beds are so comfortable you never want to get out of them. They're decently sized and the view is okay for the price you pay. The showers are wonderful and everything about the room and the service is just pleasant. It really gives you a nice escape from the busy bustle of Las Vegas but puts you right back there down the elevator if you need another whiff. 

I am especially a huge fan of their 24\/7 cafe because they serve the best fried chicken!

If there's one thing I don't like, it's spoiled Negative Nancy's that love to complain about how this hotel is not like the Wynn or the Bellagio. It's NOT. Now please stop posting pictures of receipts showing how much you spent at Burberry and Ferragamo for an item made in Vietnam or Sri Lanka. Nobody cares. 

For its price, this hotel is really nice. The rooms have been recently renovated, and its location on the strip is almost perfect. But the main reason why I'm giving it a 3-star rating (I was even tempted to give a 2-star) is because somehow, some way, my protein shakes (of all things) went missing between my arrival and the bell desk taking my luggage upstairs. Now of course they were only $7, and it shouldn't be a big deal. But it's the principle that counts. It was still MY property. So yeah *Kanye shrug*

Pros:
- Nice renovated rooms.
- Safe and fridge in rooms.
- Decent dining options.
- Great location on the strip.
- Great views (if you're lucky).
- Pool is very nice.
- Easy check-in and check-out.

Cons:
- Having to show room key every time at the elevators.
- My frickin' protein shakes went missing.
- Self-parking is all the way in the back.
- Many of the dining places close early and open late.
- TV in room was slow and clunky.",3,3,0

My reservation was booked and prepaid through Orbitz. The hotel where the conference was held was booked out which is why I ended up at Treasure Island. Two days into the conference (May 7), I was informed that a new block of rooms were released. So I contacted the front desk at Treasure Island and asked if I can check out two days early, and Ausi (hope I didn't massacre his first name too bad) said I can check out early and a refund will come back through Orbitz. Taking his word, I went ahead, packed my bags, checked out from Treasure Island and moved to the hotel where the conference was held.

On Thursday May 10, I contacted Orbitz to see when would I get a refund, so they put me on hold for around 10 mins while they contacted Treasure Island. After 10 mins, they told me that Treasure Island does not do refunds and that I should go ahead and contact Treasure Island directly. So I did, I contacted the main number (702-894-7111) and after talking to them, they transferred me to the Front Desk. After talking to the Front Desk, I was transferred to the sales department. The woman in sales said that I am a customer of Orbitz, Orbitz is the one who took my money and I should talk with them. I told her I did talk to Orbitz, Orbitz told me to contact the hotel, which is why I'm talking to you now, but she didn't care. When I told I spoke with the guy at Front Desk and he told me not to worry and I can checkout early, she said he wasn't supposed to... However, he did. She said that's not her problem, he wasn't supposed to talk to me in the first place, go contact Orbitz, and went ahead and HUNG UP ON ME!

Even without that, the place is a dump. When I got there on Saturday night, they gave me a smoking room even though I had requested a non-smoking room. They moved me into a non-smoking room on Sunday, but the room didn't have any towels. When I requested towels, they didn't bring them until at least an hour later (I waited for an hour, but ended up having to leave to go to my conference, without a shower or anything). Then this whole refund fiasco happened on Monday. And don't even get me started with the stains on the bed!

The negative:
1.  They no longer have the pirate show.  Other then looking at the ships outside there really is nothing pirate or islandish about it.  
2.  Do not bring kids here.  There is nothing for them to do.  No arcades, no scenery, nothing. 
3.  The options for places to eat are limited.  There are no food courts with options to choose from.  All the restaurants are higher end with the exception of Senor Frogs and the Coffee Shop. 
4.  You will be paid more in wifi then just to risk going over in your data plan. If you opt to you use it good luck getting it to work.  Not one of the people in our group could get access to it all weekend. 

The positive:
1. Hotel is clean and smells good. I couldn't find the air fresheners so I am assuming it's in the vents. 
2.  Its across the street from the Fashion mall that has a great food court at regular mall prices. 
3.  Beds are super comfy but could use heavier blankets. 
4.  The foot court had a ton of options to choose from but the food was just average.  But I must say the place was very clean, and didn't feel like you were in a buffet.  Very well done but again you get what you pay for.  (3 people for $103!!!)
5.  There are two Starbucks which was a huge help considering there are no coffee makers in the rooms.  There are refrigerators which is a nice thing to have when traveling with kids. 
6.  Loved the soap and shampoo they supplied.  smelled and felt great. That's a hard thing to find in hotels these days a well.  
7.  Senor frogs was a fun spot.  
8.  Staff was very nice and helpful. Security guards at room towers could use some personality.

I had what appeared to be a decent deal through hotels.com. The rooms came with a free buffet for two and were at a comparable rate. At the front desk, I was charged an additional resort fee for $56 dollars a room thus effectively negating the good deal. I was also advised that of the three rooms there was only one non-smoking available, this was at 6pm. With the $56 two day mandatory resort fee, we had the privilege of using the fitness room, using WIFI but only 1 device per room, and daily paper which you had to go to the lobby to pick-up.

The rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom was spacious and clean. There was a small refrigerator and a small safe for personal items. 

I brought a bottle of champagne to celebrate my daughter's twenty-first birthday. I called the front desk to get an ice bucket, there was none in the room, they gladly would bring one up for $5.41. If we wanted Champagne glasses would be an additional $5.41 for 2. 

I was getting slightly annoyed with all the nickle and dime charges for normal services. 

In the morning, I searched for a coffee maker and found none, not included. 

I tried the fitness room. There was a complete gym. The machines were well maintained. They had a nice variety of nautilus machines, cable systems and free weights. There were plenty of cardio machines. 

The free buffets which were included were for lunch 11-1 on weekdays. They offered a two for one special in exchange. They come with an all you can drink addition of $12. All you can drink was limited to Budweiser and cheap wine. After hearing feedback from my children on the buffet, I decided to pay full price for a meal elsewhere.

I had never stayed on the strip before, and the closest my husband had ever gotten was the Stratosphere, so we were happy to be somewhere centrally located. In fact, I think location is TI's strongest suit: you are directly across from the Venetian and Palazzo, and Belaggio and Caesar's are under a mile away. 

We booked our hotel and flight together, and even on a weekend, TI ended up being only about $60 per night, which was a pretty good deal. Overall, the hotel was easy to navigate, clean, moderately priced, and obviously well located. We were supposed to have a cruddy view since we had a discounted rate, but we actually got a corner room, which is slightly larger, and a view of the strip from two sides of our room. The room was comfortable and adequate, and I was overall happy with our choice to stay here.

However, some things did detract from our stay: upon arriving, we had to wait 45 minutes to check in. Yes, it was a Friday, yes it was busy. But guess what? Fridays in Vegas are always busy, so perhaps TI should staff more than 3 people to check in guests, when they have room for at least 10 clerks at their front desk. Of these 3 staff members, 2 spent literally 20 minutes with a group of clients, so essentially only one person was working. He was exceptionally good at his job, but there was only one of him. 
The ""resort fee"" is $20 a day which is ridiculous. This includes access to the fitness center, and wifi. Wifi is normally $15 per day, but I would rather just not have wifi, or have to pay to use the fitness center. 

Our second night, I was awakened for 2 hours in the middle of the night by an endless stream of hotel guests walking up the stairs and by our room ceaselessly, and loudly. At first I thought it was one rude group, but as it continued I realized something must have gone wrong. Turns out the elevators stopped working, which meant people were having to walk all the way up to their rooms, (we were on floor 17). They were obviously unhappy about it, were loud and drunk and woke up everyone who was asleep. Although TI cannot make people be quiet, they did nothing to make up for this to anyone, including the guests who had to walk up 17+ flights of stairs. 

Although our room was clean, I was surprised that all horizontal surfaces in our room were covered in a week's worth of dust. I found it puzzling that surfaces were not wiped down between guests. Additionally, we passed several discarded room service carts that sat outside our neighbor's room for over 8 hours, and were never cleared.

The next day, we got a room change to another room with a double bed, but that room was father from the other room we booked and we requested both of our rooms near each other. On the positive side, Both of the rooms had a nice view of the street facing the Trump tower. The beds were comfy, no bed bugs were found, and the rooms were surprisingly clean despite the yelp reviews.

Food was on the pricey side (that's almost everything on the strip), but we only tried the pho while staying there, and ate out for all our other meals. 

There's a CVS on the first floor when you turn right when entering through the front door of the hotel, and the prices are similar to ones back home. I got a naked smoothie for about $3. They also sell souvenirs, some are pricey and some not. 

The part I disliked the most was walking from the parking garage to the hotel room elevators. You have to pass by shop and restaurants and slot machines just to get to the elevators. The part I liked the most was that there was a tram to the Mirage. It was convenient, because we didn't have to walk in the cold or ride the elevator to get there. 

Overall, it was an okay place to stay. The rooms were clean, but it wasn't the room we wanted. I didn't like walking through smoke permeated lobby. The location was near one end of the strip, but that was okay.",0,3,0

She didn't even say to me i'll be right back!  so finally i get into my room and in the bathroom there's facial hair all over the sink that i wiped down myself! GROSS!  the rest of the room was fine.  Then what made me never want to go back there again is the fact that in the end i asked for my receipt for my corp CC and the girl constantly repeated herself over and over again in an obnoxious tone that i just told her to stop talking.  Didn't make any sense and she couldn't explain why she couldn't give me a receipt.  And the icing on the cake is they charge for EVERYTHING now! i needed a humidifier in my room and they wanted to charge me $15 a day for it.

Each time we stay at T.I. check in is fast and I love that about their customer service. On our last visit they even gave us a bottle of bubbly to welcome us. This time however we stayed with them as official parents so we had to tone it down, a bit.

If memory serves me correctly nothing has dramatically changed. Casino floors still smell smokey even though Nevada is enforcing the 'clean air act.' Tangerine is now replaced with that dude that makes those tacky t-shirt designs, Christian what's-his-name. Our room was on the 25th floor with views of both the strip of the east and beautiful sunsets to the west. 

I do have to complain about their beds and since I've been spoiled with staying in their suites in the past their beds in the deluxe room are one big bust. The mattress was not comfortable at all and found myself rolling down toward the center. Yuck! However I have to give them credit for using high thread count sheets.

Room service was on the pricey side and didn't offer anything interesting for dinner not even from their adjoining restaurants down stairs. I got a cobb salad even though what I really wanted was steak and eggs or a meal from Social House. 

I think it's safe to say we'll be staying next door next time. Thanks T.I.!",1,0,0

LOCATION: AWESOME, center of the strip. The location worked out well for a girl's weekend, esp since CVS was across the street (BIG PLUS!!).

Hotel:
A bit old for my taste, especially since we have so many other hotels in the area, but we booked this hotel on Hotwire, so didn't have a choice.

The plus side is that you don't have to pay the resort fee, so saved us a bit of money there.

Service:
The lady checking us in was awesome  she gave us a view of the strip when we asked. Smooth check in and even gave us 4 cards.

However, the guy calling the taxi with red hair seems to lack any sort of filter. We were confused as to who was going to take the first taxi because one of the girls was going back early and we were telling her to take the first taxi. The taxi guy whispers under his breath, ""Guess no one speaks English."" Why even say that? We did absolutely nothing to aggravate him. I can't believe TI employs people like this.

The Tower Suite has two bathrooms, one with a stand alone shower, the other with a jacuzzi bath tub.

The other negative was that booking the room was a bit of a pain in the ass because according to the booking staff you may request that you get two beds in your suite but they do not guarantee that they will give it to you, for this reason they recommended that I show up on the day of my check in at 11am because they sometimes honer an early check- in and the double bed rooms go to first come 1st serve. Me and my party arrived at 11am, I waited in a long line and was told that my room was not ready and to come back within 2 hours.

Check in: Very smooth, We were checking in at about 9pm so I was surprised to see about 10 people in front of us, but the line moved quickly and the woman that checked us in was very pleasant. We booked a tower suite, and she asked us smoking or non. We said whichever was located higher up, and while she phoned to find out the answer, she grabbed us an envelope with a bunch of promotions inside. We were given a complimentary drink ticket and a 20% off dinner to Kahunaville, a 2 for 1 buffet ticket, 2 free passes (44 dollar value) to the spa, and free entry into the night club. It also included a VIP ticket to the Sirens show, but I hear you can get VIP access with just your room key.

Tower Suite: Our room ended up being 32-011 (non smoking). Rooms 30 and up have their own elevators where you have to enter your room key so it will recognize what floor to stop on. Nice touch, it sure made me feel special! The room was HUGE. Very clean, spacious, and looked just like the pictures I have seen. The his bathroom has a glass door shower with the ""rain"" like shower head. The closet is small with sliding doors and a safe inside. The hers bathroom is much larger with lots of counter space, a make up area complete with a seat and a vanity mirror, a spacious closet with a dresser and plenty of hanging space, and a whirlpool tub. The room has a flat screen TV which is very nice and has plenty of channels. The rooms are dim even with several light fixtures, but this was fine with me. There is a couch which is pretty comfortable, a fridge, a dining table, and the double doors to the room is a beautiful touch. We slept in this room the first night, but the boy decided to switch rooms the next day because the bed had a rather deep dip in it on one side, when the tub was turned on sand came out of the faucet, and the fridge didn't work. Our second room was 7-050 which ended up being our room for the next 3 nights. It was still a tower suite, but the main room was slightly smaller. Everything worked well, the only problem we had with the second room was the bed. While it was plush and comfortable, apparently they don't have sheets that fit it, and the boy was really upset when we crawled into bed and our feet were touching bare mattress. He requested the bed to be changed, and when the maids came to replace the bedding,they had to try several different sheets before they could find one to cover it. Even after that fiasco, the sheets would slip around and expose the mattress because they are not fitted. Kind of odd, but a minor problem. Oh yes, and all of the reviews I read they talk of the ipod dock clock radio in the rooms, so I didn't bother to bring my ipod charger. Neither room that we had had the ipod dock. The first room was a bose machine, the second was just some generic clock radio. Oh well, didn't really need the ipod besides for the plane ride home! We got a movie one night and was surprised by their extensive movie choice list. If you want to call it a night and want to relax with a movie you won't be disappointed!

Room Service: We ordered room service twice which was very quick and not too pricey. Always try to order between _:10 and _:20 because they deliver on the 1\/2 hours. Our food was piping hot and made right before coming up. I would suggest the chicken tenders and the clubhouse sandwich. Both delicious! Do not make the mistake I made of ordering soda to the room. 3 bucks for each can when all I had to do was step out of my room, walk 10 feet and get 20 oz. bottles from the vending machine for the same price. Oops! Vending machines also have vitamin water which we both love.

Casino Floor: Rather small compared to other casinos, but I liked it a lot. Had a very cozy feel. The poker room is tiny but we spent some time in there playing their daily tournaments which are cheap ($65 for 3500 in chips with the ability to rebuy in the first hour) which were extremely soft and easy to place in. The cash game looks okay, but I wouldn't personally choose it because the players will tend to be regulars, thus making it not as soft as other places such as MGM and Mirage. The table games seemed to be busy at all hours. The boy played some ""Let it Ride"" but we didn't see any good runs, most people just lost their money, got up and left. Cheap blackjack tables were available also for those who don't want to spend too much. We played Lobstermania slot machines for a laugh and actually more than doubled our money in 3 spins!

Check out: Very quick and easy. We checked out at 12 but our flight wasn't until 4 so we gave our bags to the bell desk and they took care of our bags and loaded them into the taxi right away when we came back for them. All of the staff was extremely friendly and caring. We ate at several of TI's restaurants, so please look at my reviews on them!",2,0,1

It's an easy walk to Fashion Show Mall, Wynn, Palazzo and the Venetian. The connecting tram to the Mirage makes Caesars and Bellagio a comfortable walk.

Following Puff Daddy's and Prince's lead, the hotel formerly known as ""Treasure Island"" is now ""T.I."".

Treasure Island was a great option for a moderately priced hotel for both purposes for my trips to Vegas.  The beds are comfortable and the room decor is trendy and looked recently renovated.  There are a few good options for drinks or appetizers onsite; and a selction of restaruants, though not upscale, offer decent dining options.   The casino is not as large as other hotels, which may dissappoint gambling fans, but also felt quieter and made the hotel easier to navigate than other Vegas hotels I have been in.   The location on the strip is very good with more upscale hotels such as the Venetian  and tons of shopping very close by.   

There are a few negatives to this hotel.  The Sirens of TI show occurs several times a night, which is fine if your purpose in Vegas is to stay out late so you never hear it anyway; but can get obnoxious if you are actually in your room which faces the show and hear the blasts of the fireworks night after night.   Most people in Vegas will opt to eat dinner out; however, if for some reason you are eating in your room I do not reccommend TI room service.  It was very expensive and the food was greasy.

I chose this hotel on a recommendation of a friend. We came to get married and to go to Defcon. Upon arrival, I noticed how generic and tacky all of the decorations were. Then, I had to wait in line for an HOUR to check in. That's exactly what I want to do when I have been on airplane for over seven hours. Then we found out about the resort fee. WHAT RESORT? The pool is small, and plays really really really loud rap music for ten hours a day, so loud in fact, that I could hear it in my room, FOR TEN HOURS A DAY. Since we were in Vegas to get married, we had expensive jewelry with us, so we didn't want to maids to come in the room. We put the jewelry in the safe, and then put the privacy sign on the door. We came back about ten hours later, and the sign was gone, the room was cleaned and the safe wouldnt work. I called security and they had to come and unlock it, which to me, means someone messed with it. I called and complained and they blamed me for not putting the sign up. I KNOW that I put the sign up. The jewelry was still there, but I shouldnt feel unsafe in my hotel room. I would have loved to nap during the day before going out, but I couldnt because of the loud obnoxious rap music coming up from the pool. All of this was nothing though. The night before we left, I was getting ready for bed, and was rearranging the sheets, and FOUND FECES. FECES on the sheets. Like a dried, crusted spot. We didnt have an animal with us, and we are two grown adults. I was so angry. When I called the front desk, they sent a manager upstairs, and she was astonished. They promptly sent someone up to clean our room. HOWEVER. We went downstairs to talk to a manager face to face, and she basically told us that there was nothing for her to do. She was trying to tell me, who just got married and chose to spend our honeymoon in their hotel, that when I find SHIT in my bed, they can't do anything about it. I was so pissed. Luckily, their bar is open 24 hours. I had a drink, and went back up to the room. By then, the housekeeper had cleaned the room. The next morning, we went to check out to come home, and re-told the morning manager what had happened. She was embarrassed, this manager was much nicer. They comped the $120 ""resort"" fee and our room service. I was glad...because there is no way I would have paid for this stay here.

I would like to repeat again, that I will never, ever stay here again. The food in this hotel is TERRIBLE, the service is TERRIBLE, and the decorations are TERRIBLE. Cheap, tacky and not in that cute Las Vegas tacky way either. They are going to have to do something, because there is no way they will maintain across from the Wynn.",1,3,0

I was on the 24th floor with a window view looking northeast up the Strip. The furnishings and amenities were stylish and comfortable. As other reviewers have noted, T.I. is a good ""friends and family"" spot, which, alas, is not such a good thing if you are looking for something a bit more urbane, sophisticated and adult.

We got their at around 7:00 am. Wow. The bell hop man told us their is rooms available at around 11:00. And we waited 3 hours and walked around. Finally, we checked in. We had a really nice room, with a strip\/pool\/the rio\/and mountain view. It was beautiful at night. The room was a strip view room with two queen beds. The tv is nice size, but it stinks because their is not a variety of channels. The beds are pretty comfortable, especially the pillows. Soft as a cloud. Some people might think they are overrated though. Their pool had a nice vibe to it. Very nicely decorate. I didnt bother going though because in two weeks, next sunday, im going to grand mayan in puerto vallarta. The restaurants are pretty good. I will review those seperately.

my first real  halfbaked vacation in two years and not so planned either as everything was just out of impulse. I remember when i first toured LV we stayed at an average hotel--well this ones waaaay better. I never realized from the inside that T.I was really huge until we crossed the walkway towards some shopping center, i forgot the name. lobby is mediocre-- not really the huge type halls with all those big vases and marble type counters. Youll see the mediocrity in their carpets, but all in all it was a good experience with TI.

minus 2 stars for the $15 dollar internet service. and for not having extra toiletries and towels. we still had to call. They should think that families  and not just couples avail rooms too, so why give 3 towels per room when I specified 4 guests each?? come on. The price i guess was reasonable, like $ 700+ for 2 rooms adjoining.  I learned my lesson well, next time ask for rooms proximate to the elevators- saves you from shoe marks after partying all night esp. when your feet are numb and tired. the pillows really wrecked my neck, i prefer the firm ones.

The room is definitely nice and spacious and clean. We had a nice view even though it was the strip. The price for our room was great  because it was 30% off the normal price per day which save us a lot.

Checking at the Hotel was great cause we got to check in at 2pm instead of the normal 3pm Check in. Checking out was easy and simple. There's a person that stands on the line for express check out. They only need your last name, email address, and phone number of you choose to do express check out which I did and very convenient plus they will email you a confirmation receipt within 4 business days. 

The only thing I didn't like was that there jacuzzi wasn't hot at all. It was like ambient water.

I'll put this review in bullet points:

PROS:
- Easy access!  Getting on and off the freeway was easy.  Finding parking on NYE afternoon was easy.  Finding the way through the casino was easy.  Getting our luggage to the room on our own was very easy (no maze, no long walk, no lugging your bags through a mall, then a parking lot, then ten casino rooms etc).  We went from the parking garage to our room within 5 minutes easily.  And most importantly, access the the Strip was fast and easy.  If you forgot something in your room and had just walked out the Strip, it wasn't a big deal to go back and get it.

- The Tram to the Mirage: a nice bonus in cold or hot weather.  It was nice to be able to have a tram to go to another hotel without walking a mile or two to get there.

- The rooms: UPDATED and CLEAN.  Even on NYE and the day after, house cleaning was prompt, thorough, and quick.  Upon arrival, our room was clean, the bed was clean, the bathroom was clean, and it was comfortable.  The towels had a bit of a bleach smell, but at least you knew they were getting clean instead of having a BO smell, right?  No complaints about cleanliness here.

- Customer Service: We got to the hotel on NYE two hours before check-in and went to the front desk to see if we could check-in early.  And guess what, it wasn't a problem at all.  The lady working at the front desk was polite and very helpful.  We requested a higher level floor and she put us on the 31st floor and then said it would be easier for us because it was the first floor on an express elevator so we wouldn't have to wait for it to go to a bunch of other floors to get to ours.  How nice of her!!

- Location: Beside just easy access to the Strip or the freeway, it has a walkway to the Fashion Show Mall next door and a tram to the Mirage on the other side.  Walking across the street wasn't a problem at all.  There isn't a maze to get into the casino like there is at others.  It's at a GREAT location on the Strip, especially for the price.

CONS:

-Casino Smoke: This is a given though in ALL casinos in Las Vegas, but I think since it's a bit older of a hotel, the smoke has just been in the carpets too long, so you can smell the smoke a bit more here than in say a brand new casino, but it was never unbearable.  The room wasn't smoky at all and was a nice get-a-way from the smoke.

- No refrigerator or microwave in the standard rooms.",3,0,0

I thought the rooms were very nice and clean. I don't understand the negative reviews, it's not The Cosmopolitan or The Bellagio so don't expect 5 star rooms when you're paying less than half the price.

The rooms aren't huge but they're newly renovated and nicely appointed. The bath tubs are larger than most standard rooms which was a big plus. The beds are quite comfortable also. Location is great, right across from the mall and the Wynn hotel, walking distance to everything and a tram ride to the Mirage.

Yes there's a $28 per night resort fee that's required upon check in but that's also stated when you're booking the hotel, so why the hell are people surprised? Every hotel charges a resort fee in Las Vegas similar to TI.",4,1,1

My sister just turned 21, so it was obviously necessary for me to take her to Vegas. Luckily my mom and my sisters best gal pal agreed. So we embarked on an adventure that I guarantee can not possibly be duplicated, but we were more than impressed with the accommodations we called 'home' for three nights.

I love my bed. We have had a wonderful, committed relationship for the past five years. Sure, I've slept around but I always knew I was coming back home to you. It was a close call this time... I didn't want to leave and I definitely spent more time sleeping than I should have. But I couldn't tear myself away! The bed was just so damn comfortable and the linens were so soft and luxurious!

Now, I wasn't really a fan of the restaurants they had there but they did have a cool bar called Kahunaville with a station outside by the pool. We got these huge huge huge drinks (three of us had to share) and I would say we had a pretty nice time relaxing by the pool. Not the coolest pool in the world, but it served its purpose and we found four lounge chairs next to one another.

Good location. The price was outstanding! We ended up paying like $80 per night. The rooms really were very nice, the bathrooms were huge (although there was no blow dryer in the room) and when our Ipod docking station wasn't working very well, we called down to room service and they brought us a new one within the hour.

Great value, amazing bed... if I can muster up the will to go to Vegas again, I will certainly be back to share another night of bliss with the amazing bed.",9,7,7

Not a laugh or a joke or even a smile. Is Treasure Island owned by Disney? The card dealers are all animatronic. No. No. They're Dementors.

We go to our room, which was ok. We were on the 29th floor. We get to the pool at 1pm and there was no chairs available, nor much room on the ground and the pool was jammed packed. So we left. We went to Gilly's with our group of 14 and asked if we can get separate checks, they refused. We told them if it was a gratuity issue then to put the 18% on all of our checks, no big deal. They still refused. We asked for a manager and our waitress did not get her so someone else did. The manager also refused our request. Then we requested another waitress since the last one was rude and she refused that too and said they would have to re seat us and we would have to wait again. After our kids made a mess of the table, all 14 of us got up and left. We went to kahunaville. The waiter was nice enough to separate our checks without us even asking. So he got a big tip. 

The next day we call housekeeping to make sure they will clean our room. We leave the room and I get back around noon to a messy room. I found the maid and she told me she already cleaned our room. I said said "" you sure didn't"" and she said she did and showed me where she marked it off. So I had her take a look at our room and she said I made it a mess and she was not going to clean it. So we get the manager who saw it had not been cleaned and the room was cleaned. 

That day we also got to the pool early to get chairs. We wanted drinks and getting the pool waitress to help us was like pulling teeth so we got up and got them ourselves.

Since we were on the 29th floor and overlooking the treasure show, it was loud! We could hear it clearly at 11:30PM which is one of the show times. But when you have kids, it wakes everyone up. 

My one last complaint is the cigarette smoke in the casino. A few of the newer casinos filter that out so you cant smell it. They need to do the same. 

The rate was very reasonable, but we reserved a block of a dozen rooms, but this takes you get what you pay for to a whole new level. Wont be staying here again,",8,4,1

Immediately upon contacting TI, I was taken care of by a team of professionals to make sure every detail I wanted was handled. Misha and Bianca from the chapel, along with Jaime from catering, were AMAZING! This is a chapel that might put on as many as 15-20 weddings in one day, and I never ever once felt like a number. Every time I spoke to them I felt like I was the only bride they were working with. We brought in about 35 guests to our reception, and had a buffet style meal catered. I was most nervous about the food, but this was probably the best part! Everything was fresh, and beautiful and tasty. Additionally the staff serving us were amazing. It was worth every penny and then some! The Cashman Photographer was excellent, and he took a lot of pictures. They will get you in to order pictures typically the day after your wedding. Be prepared to be shocked at the cost of copies and enlargements!

Over all I had good luck here in the past but I must say my last visit was not that great. First I checked in and had issues with them telling me I owed more than my reservations because I had booked through a t v add to waive the resort fee of like 30 a day for what Internet and use of gym I don't think so ! So after proving my reservation correct on paper with t v
Add and it waived the resort free then he gave me a bigger room haha end of hallway corner room might have been larger but the tv is not on a wall facing the bed its way off to the side and its damn near impossible to watch it from the bed. The toilet was slow flushing as well. Over all the room cleanliness was a 7 out of 10. There were stains on bottom of duvet cover there was a lot of dust as well on fixtures. Not many upgrades other than the phones in the rooms over theist five years. Same decor it's ok but getting a little dated. I had room and bell service one time each fairly prompt and pleasant. The rest of my visit was ok I used the pool it was ok. They now have staff at all elevators all the time now looking to make sure you have room keys and are a guest which is good keeps the riff raft out. So I check out leave go home a few days ago in the mail I get a bill from TI. For $230 for the resort fee for my stay. I say wait a minute I had no internet in my room. It was
Waived at check in and I had paid cash for my stay at check in. I immediately call and I'm told yes you owe us pay now or go to collections. I said no my reservation was from TV promotion with no resort fee ! One transferred call to front desk
Then the manager to explains situation and threatening to go all over social media and reviews with the is BS and the bill is waived but not until I have to make threats on my end. Not cool. He tells me oh booking or front end didn't know about the promotions. I call BS. I mean you don't update your employees on new promotions or pass

The 9th floor room and hallways wreaked of smoke. The room felt dirty maybe because the smell but as I looked behind dresser for plug it was dirty. I checked for bed bugs per other reviews. It was good and all clean. Everytime I rolled over the smell would wake me up. Horrible. If I rated smoking room it would be been 1 or 2 stars.

Room:
The room was decent but nothing spectacular. Other than a bit more space, the biggest difference from most standard rooms was having two full bathrooms; one with a shower and one with a tub. The bed and pillows were also decent\/fairly comfortable. On the negative side the tv was pretty small for a suite, I think it was only 32 inches. Also, and despite being on the 27th floor (mountain view) there was still a considerable amount of noise from the roadway below. Although the room had a refrigerator, it was empty, no minibar items, no snacks, no water bottles (for purchase or otherwise). We were told at check out that too many guests were having problems with the touch sensitive items in the fridge (making unintended purchases) that they removed the minibars all together. 

Food
Our deal included 2 for 1 buffet. We ate there on a Sunday for the champagne brunch. The regular price is $23.95 and despite having the 2 for 1 deal, we didn't feel it was worth the cost. Food selection was pretty limited for a Sunday champagne brunch; the omelette station had few choices; no waffle station; the only fresh seafood was peel and eat shrimp. For comparison, we ate at the Sunday buffet at M Casino later that same night and it was spectacular. It's a bit more pricey at $39.99 but well worth it. But be sure to have a big appetite\/be very hungry because there is so much food!! There were so many options I can't even begin to name them all here but a few highlights in addition to unlimited beer and wine there was: peel & eat shrimp, steamed and cold crab legs (already sliced open so no struggling to get the meat out), oysters on the half shell, prime rib and roast turkey carving stations, several Thai selections, sides, sushi, salads, deserts, espresso; the options seemed endless. I highly recommend this buffet. We also ate at the Seafood Shack at TI; it wasn't the worst meal I've had but it was disappointing and again, not worth the price. We had calamari, scallops, and beer battered fish. The calamari and fish were so greasy. I wound up pulling all of the batter off the fish. And by the way, under all that greasy batter there was very little fish. The scallops and rice pilaf were just okay. The best thing I had in the hotel was the Green Iguana cocktail at Kahunaville. 

Other:
Upon check in my BF was told to call room service at anytime during our stay for a complimentary bottle of champagne for my birthday; unfortunately I never got it. We tried to contact room service periodically for 2 days and ALWAYS got a busy signal. I finally contacted the front desk and explained the situation. The young lady offered to call room service to see if she could help. After putting me on hold to try and contact them she returned only to say that she was put on hold and was unable to help; I would just need to keep trying. 

Overall:

Treasure Island is not crappy.  

Despite a room rate change, which they promptly lowered to the correct rates, I was completely satisfied with my stay. 

The rooms have a nice contemporary design, with nice colors.  The king sized bed was incredibly comfortable.  I even appreciated one soft pillow and one firmer pillow.  The bathroom was quite large.  Even the toiletries had a nice scent to them.  We were on the 11th floor, with a view of the Strip.  I found myself sitting in a comfortable lounge chair and staring out at the movement and lights.  

Check in was easy.  The clerk was helpful and pleasant.  

My one complaint was the smoke right by the room elevators.  For whatever reason, the filters for the ventilation couldn't really compensate for the smoke right there.  Everywhere else in the casino was fine.  I couldn't smell smoke.  But, everytime we went by the elevators, it was super strong.  

I did end up gambling about $20.  (For me, that is a lot.)  I stayed for about an hour at the Star Wars Droid Hunt game.  Super fun.  Those game companies know how to keep us entertained!

Nothing was terrible, by any means, but it wasn't as amazing as some of the other places that I've stayed at. 

Let's break it down.

The location is superb. It was easy to walk from it to nearby casinos, like the Venetian, Mirage and Caesars. We even walked as far down as Bellagio and Planet Hollywood, although those are a bit more of a trek and I'd recommend getting your walking shoes out for those. We did make it from Treasure Island to Tao at the Venetian in heels though via the overpass with no problem. 

The rooms are basic but clean. We had a standard room with two queens. The room seemed a little smaller than others that I've stayed at in Vegas  but we mainly used the room to sleep so it's not a big deal. It did come with a mini fridge, which was handy for storing drinks. Ironically, our group of California liberals ended up in a room overlooking the Trump tower, which severely spoiled our view. Obviously, I'm not holding this against the hotel. It's just unfortunate that Trump is their neighbor. 

The biggest disappointment for me was their tiny pool. It was over 100 degrees and I was really looking forward to hanging out by the pool. I didn't realize that Vegas hotels had pools this tiny. It was very crowded and we were lucky to be able to carve out a little section for us to take a dip as it was way too hot to be sitting in the lounge chairs. Believe me, I tried and started to feel faint in the heat. The water felt nice though but it was annoying to be bumped into by other people repeatedly. Next time I'll look for a hotel with a bigger pool area and probably multiple pools. 

On the plus side, Treasure Island is home to Mystere and we loved being able to get dressed up, take the elevator downstairs and walk such a short distance to the show. We also received 2-for-1 tickets for staying at T.I., so that was a perk!

Check in on a Friday around noon was relatively easy with about a five minute wait. We had another friend who had booked her room separately and we asked to be on the same floor. They were accommodating and were even able to give us adjoining rooms. 

Food options were just okay. We ate at the hotel's cafe and the small pizza joint inside (I'll write separate reviews for both) but there wasn't a lot of choices for a quick bite. 

We were bummed to learn that the pirate show isn't performed anymore out front but at least the ships are still in place.

Love the free parking and ""free"" wifi that is included in the mandatory $35 daily resort fee. Considering that it's the only feature of the resort fee that we used, I can't really consider it to be free though and it's a bit annoying that we're forced into the resort fee that covers things we don't even use, like the fitness center. 

Overall, I'd give T.I. 3.5 stars if I could but it just doesn't quite warrant four stars.",8,3,3

It's on the West side of the Strip in between the Mirage and the Fashion Show Mall and directly across from the Venetian and the Palazzo, so you're pretty close to TAO (Venetian) and XS (Encore)
if you're planning on hitting up the clubs. 

I stayed here last April with a big group for our friends' 22nd birthday, so we all packed into one of their suites. The room was pretty nice and very clean, but it wasn't incredibly special. They usually have pretty good rates here even on weekends, so if you want to stay somewhere nice but not necessarily go all out then this is a happy medium. But if you can find a room at the Venetian for only $30-40 more a night, it's probably just worth upgrading and booking a room across the street.

This hotel has my favorite casino because they have this Gold Fish slot machine that's really fun to play. I've never won much money on it, but I like it.

Don't forget to catch their ""Sirens of T.I."" show, it's pretty hokey but it's one of the many free things to do on the Strip.",0,0,0

It's very fancy for what you pay for, the staff is very nice, and our view was awesome! We stayed during the week and got a great deal (which had me worried about the service) but it was much more than I expected. Our suite had two FULL bathrooms! One with an amazing shower and the other with a spa! Incredible. During our stay I called the concierge several times to ask questions and they were always ready with answers. I called to ask if i could buy a shower cap somewhere and they has someone run it up to my room. It's super close to the mall which was nice especially in 110 degrees! And, it has a tram that connects you to the mirage which was also very nice. But no food court :( which actually wasn't too much of a big deal since the mall has a huge one and is right across the street.

There were only two down sides to this entire trip (which were to be expected to a certain extent). The first was the extremely long line to check in. Apparently there was a convention or something, but I had never seen a line wrap so many times. A gentleman in front of us said he had been avoiding it for two hours because it was moving so slow, so I was nervous. But the line actually moved! They kept calling more and more staff to come help and we were to the front of the line before we knew it. It was a little longer than I would want to wait to check in, but I thought they handled it quite well. The other thing was the mandatory amenity fee. We were only there for two days so we didn't even make use of the gym, or anything they offered other than the internet (which would have been cheaper on its own) so that was disappointing.

I chose this hotel on the recommendation of a friend plus it was one of the few available for a one night Saturday stay on Memorial Day weekend.
 
I drove into town and the hotel parking was easy to find. It was a hike from the parking deck to registration so pack light and wear comfortable shoes. Thanks to my sherpa guide provided by the hotel.

Check-in seemed to take forever but in reality it was ""only"" 50 mins. I can't blame the hotel staff for this; it seemed almost everyone was a self appointed VIP with a list of special requests  who found it difficult to treat the staff with common civility.  The others were European tourists who nodded their heads eagerly to everything but clearly had no idea what was going on.

I had reserved a room with a Strip view at an extra cost but was then told that a reservation for a specific room type was in no way a guarantee that would be the room you'd actually get. I was down-graded to a different category with no assurance that the rate would be adjusted. Welcome to Las Vegas.

The room: Once upstairs the accommodations were clean, bright and spacious. Everything that was supposed to work worked well; flat screen television, wi-fi, comfortable bed. The bathroom was large with plenty of little shampoo bottles and large towels. 

The pool: well maintained with plenty of comfortable chairs. I had barely settled in when a roving server showed up to take my drink order. The water was clear but without the overpowering stench of chlorine. There was a good sized crowd with the usual assortment of big people in small Speedos, screaming kids, Jersey Shore types and cooler-than-thou Vegas veterans. One thing was apparent; everyone was out to have a good time and a good time was being had by all.

Dining: It was a busy, high traffic weekend and as expected there were lines for everything. I had picked up my girlfriend from the airport (excellent directions provided by the staff) and we were both hungry and tired. We opted for the buffet and weren't disappointed. It may not have been high-end pretentious gourmet but the food was fresh, well prepared and well presented. The selection was huge and the lines moved quickly. 

Casino: I'm not a gambler so that wasn't a factor in my stay. However, I was up early and went down to get coffee at the adjacent Starbucks. The casino was nearly empty so I went to the craps table and asked if they could show me how to play. They were very friendly and helpful. I ended up getting a ""free"" lesson (not counting the $30 I wagered and loss) from the two dealers and a pit boss. 

Bar: We only went to one and I forget its' name. It was crowded, smokey and loud. The floor was sticky from countless spilled margaritas. In other words, it was just what I was hoping it would be. 

To sum up: Other travelers have raked this property over the coals. Maybe they were bounced out their regular suite at the Cosmopolitan or the Four Seasons and were expecting a $600 a night experience for $75. The TI doesn't aspire to be anything it isn't. I come from solid Brooklyn working class roots and that's just what this property caters to. I paid a premium rate for coming in mid-weekend on Memorial Day and I have no one to blame but myself. Weekday rates are extremely reasonable and if there weren't so many other hotels to experience I'd definitely stay here again.",5,0,0

FYI $28 resort fee here per day and rooms were about $55 with tax 

Upon check in- no rooms available 'with my requested type' (NS King- regular room- ) so we were placed into a two queen bed room for the night. (wasnt happy about that- my BF is larger- we were pretty squooshed in that bed!)

Next day we had to try to get the 'right room' and had to stand in line at desk to do so (1\/2 hour wait) and they gave us another room as they had said they would.

Usually , in all the other hotels in Vegas they would upgrade or comp you something to try to make amends that first night- They didnt- and should have- moving rooms was a pain in the butt. I spoke with the front desk staff she was very "" I could give a rats ass if you stay here or not' and when I spoke with the manager on duty-even she didnt seem to care if I was unhappy or not.That fake smile was so annoying.

Its not like the entire hotel was full- it was New years Day-everyone was checking OUT. 

Take note TI from Caesars,NYNY, and even CircusCircus - who have all done that ! Ive been to Las Vegas at least 10 times...Really TI?

Pros: The beds are wicked comfortable. Oh, I could've stayed in bed all day! Housekeeping (who would've thought that's a pro?!) were great, and very quick to bring up a cot for our third guest and towels. Pool was fun, we didn't spot one major dbag, and I was worried about that. Poolside service was quick. Starbucks in hotel was convenient. Great location on the strip, everything easy to get to. Parking convenient and always able to park on the same level as bridge to casino. Rooms were nicer than anticipated.

Cons: The check-in line was long. But you know what, I only paid $80 a night, and I'm on a good location on the strip. If I paid more at a different hotel, I probably wouldn't have had the wait. I checked in on a Friday afternoon, so I knew it was going to be busy (about 45 minutes to check in). And seriously, don't be all whiny about it when you're standing in line, okay? It just annoys the crap out of the happy people. I guess the line is the only con. I guess I'm so-so on the resort fee, as I did use the wifi included in the price...but it seemed a little high ($20 a day).

I would definitely stay at TI for my next trip. That is, unless the Bellagio starts offering $100 or less rooms, then I'm totally there.",0,0,0

This was my first trip to Vegas, and I was thrilled with my decision to stay at T.I.  Why are the rates so low?!  Our room was gorgeous and T.I. is in an ideal location!!  It's a quick walk to the Wynn, the Palazzo, the Venetian or the Mirage, and Caesars is within a 10-minute walk.

The room?  Beautiful.

The beds?  AMAZINGLY comfortable.

The staff?  Kind, helpful and professional.

The crowd?  Young and fun.  (More kids than I would like, but I hear that's the case in most hotels.)

The buffet?  FANTASTIC!!!

The location?  UNBEATABLE.

I also slipped the check-in clerk a $20 bill, and she got us a room on the 28th floor with a view of the pirate show (which is cheesetastic but worth seeing once and laughing at it).

The only reason why I give it 4 and not 5 stars is that there is no reason to visit T.I. if you're not a guest there -- Cirque du Soleil's Mystere (which I did not see) is the only attraction.  However, with last night's opening of Christian Audigier The Nightclub, that could change soon.

Bottom line, if you're looking for something not as expensive as Caesars or the Bellagio, GO TO T.I.!  I was VERY happy with my experience.",3,0,2

Simply because they have horrible customer service. I've worked in customer service for four years so I know what good customer service is suppose to look like. 

My BF and I got this hotel a week before his bday. We booked the room for two days (three nights). With that being said, the first night we were there the drain got clogged. We thought it go away but by the time we got back that night (a couple of hours later). It was still the same. 
Later on when we woke up it was still the same. I called housekeeping and they seem ""apologetic"" and said they would have someone come to the room as soon as possible. 
We waited 30 minutes and no one came up, by this time it was already 11:30am. So I called again, again they said someone was ""on their way"". Another hour past and still no one had come to the room.
So I called front desk, they said they would contact housekeeping and have someone come to our room.
By this time it was almost 1pm.
My BF then decided to take it upon himself to find a way to drain this tub. A few minutes later he was able to fix it.

I called housekeeping and told them I don't need anyone to come to our room anymore. The woman the that answered told me they had no history of me calling that day. 

I was so upset, annoyed, pissed off, ready to ask for a refund LOL

We were out the door by 2pm, and had lost hours trying to have someone come help us. The people working their are being paid to do a their job. The fact they left us hanging for so long is unprofessional and rude. We're on vacation and little things like this shouldn't be a problem.

The suite looked really nice online. Very modern but maybe somewhat cheesy. We were deciding between the Wynn and TI. We knew the hotel itself at TI would not be great, but we felt like we wouldn't be spending much time there anyway. The location was good so we went for it.

When we checked in at around 9:30 pm. The first thing I noticed was that the carpet in the check in area was kind of dingy, but I didn't expect anything spectacular. When we checked in they informed us that our room had been downgraded from the Tower Suite to the Executive Suite. We said we had not requested the downgrade nor had we been informed of it. They got the manager. He said that the person in the Tower Suite that we were supposed to get had not checked out yet, so they had to downgrade us to the only other available suite. they automatically reduced our rate by $40 per night. We asked if we could be upgraded instead of downgraded, but they said they didn't have any  nicer suites available. In the end, they agreed to take an additional $20 each night. They forgot to take the additional $20 off for the second night, but that is a different story.

After all that annoyance, we got to our room and the room was just fine. It was basically the same as the Tower Suite, but just a little smaller. It was perfectly fine and a steal at $240 per night.

Security may seem helpful at first but they are not! Once you leave, you can say goodbye to the thousands of dollars stolen. All they will say is that you have to go through risk management.

Justin then stated he would not give us a refund and that we had to call circ du soleil directly to ask for a refund. When asked for that phone number he stated he didn't know. When asked for further clarification related to why we could not get a number to contact them, Justin became even more rude and dismissive.

HOWEVER, treasure island has never ceased to fail me. The first time I came to Vegas (legally) I checked into the T I with my friends, and from what I can remember it was a fun trip while staying here but as the years have passed something always drags me back. I've stayed at really nice hotels such as the Bellagio, The Wynn, Excalibur etc..even crappy ones such as the Luxor (ugh, which reminds me I should probably write a horrible review for them) But in between all of those trips I still manage to stay at TI when I can just because it's one of those hotels that aren't TOO fancy and definately not low end. 

They have this scent every time you walk in that really gets me (I dunno, I'm  a sucker for small things I guess) It smells like baby oil of some sort. The slot machines in there are really good if you're not TOO much into gambling like myself (I'll play like 25 cent blackjack all night) .Customer service there is great. I'll never forget the time my friend and I were super wasted when we got to our hotel that we got into our pj's and next thing I know I'm locked out of the room and she's passed out- and I'm literally in a little black nightie, so I have to go all the way downstairs like 16 levels in an elevator and through the casino (and of course there were kids everywhere for some wedding so i'm stuck in the elevator with some 13 year old starring at me up and down) so then I go and ask customer service in this teeny little black dress to please give me a key since the hotel wasn't even in my name! I think they just felt sorry for me and let me in while holding in their laughs, but either way it was nice of them cause it was so embarrassing. Oh, and if it's your birthday tell them when you check in and they will send you a free bottle of champagne up to your room. They also have a buncha goodie buy 1 drink get 1 free coupons when you check in. 

The club there is really lame though, I mean for one its owned by that Ed Hardy guy, Christian Audigier so that says it all already...but since we got in free being hotel guests and all we gave it a shot, it's definately a place to be if you want to be surrounded by a buncha tools. Oh and the bartender was extremely rude. But besides that TI is a perfect hotel to stay at, and this is coming from a girl who's been to em all.

OH and that new $20 resort fee is bull, yes, but EVERY hotel does it not just TI... its a new Vegas rule now which is lame I know, but someone told me that if enough people complain about it then they are gonna get rid of it. So complain at the front desk about it when they mention it at the end! Throw a hissy fit. But then apologize and say it's not their fault cause TI employees are super sweet but the new Vegas rule is just BS.",5,1,3

Now with that being said the buffet (as I reviewed earlier).....the Mystere Cirque show.....and the overall intimate feel of the place.....does make this an OKAY hotel and Casino. 

I do have one very important suggestion for this locale though.....if your attending a show here or just visiting in general park on LEVEL 3 near the SKYBRIDGE to the Casino. We found out by doing this you can walk right in.....get on the TRAM if you want.....do a little shopping.....stop by Krispy Kreme......go down the Escalator and there you will find the Mystere Theater and Gift Shop. The buffet is about 40 yards or so right down the hall from there and then the Casino itself. So as you can see by parking on LEVEL 3 you can pretty much experience the Highlights of this Hotel and Casino......easy in.....easy out.

There is nothing spectacular about the place except for the location. I wuold consider it good as it's near by a mall, Caesar's, Venetia, PAris and Bellagio. 

The pool is alright. Not too big, and not too cramped. 

The room price is here is affordable. I would recommend this for people who are on a budget or planning on spending their money elsewhere. Besides, you only stay in your room to sleep and take a shower. So why the big fuss if your bed is not made of 600 thread count and the pillows are not made of goose feathers? 

The crowd is young as the other reviewers mentioned. The vibe is hipper than before. Better for people who is looking forward to parties (though I don't recommend the lounges and bars here. You may want to get in Tangerine for starters- pre party but head elsewhere for better party scene).",1,1,0

Pros:
- Clean, spacious rooms with nice views
- Prompt, courteous bell, front desk, and housekeeping staff
- Location; right next to the Mirage, Venetian, Wynn, near Cesar's
- Lots of coupons for in-house drinks and activities at checkin 
- Pool clean, large, and pretty w\/ towel service, drink service
- Señor Frog's has good food and drinks (albeit at strip prices)
- Tram to Mirage
- Access to Mirage pool

Cons:
- The salon wasn't great. They were 45 minutes late to start our makeup appointments because a technician had called out that morning, putting them behind. We had to cancel our dinner reservation before seeing Celine because we finished our appointments an hour later than planned. This would have been avoided if we had been called before the appointment and advised of the delay; we could have finished doing hair, getting dressed, etc., and been ready to leave at the end of the appointment and made our reservation. The woman at the front desk was very helpful - She printed our show tickets and gave us a discount for the services when we requested it. They made it as right as they could, but I wouldn't recommend the salon if you're on a schedule.
- Prices of food, drinks, slots, and gambling match that of the rest of the strip
- Didn't love the service at Seafood Shack; staff grumpy and not very helpful
- Mystere is fantastic and more reasonably-priced than other Cirque de Soleil shows
- Not the best hotel for nightlife; Señor Frogs and Gilly's Saloon are the only bars; no clubs, etc.

Tips:
- Like most hotels on the strip, if you arrive before checkin you can check your bags beforehand for free. At checkin they will bring your bags to your room. Only cost is gratuity to the bellman.
- Ask for any extra coupons at checkin. These may include 2-for-1 drinks at a couple of the bars, 2-for-1 buffet, and 2-for-1 Mystere tickets.",2,0,0

- Bring back the Sirens show; 
- Add a will call only window to the TI Theatre box office; 
- Turn down the goddamn volume at Señor Frogs;
- Be different than the other corporations on the strip and cease the madness of the superfluous resort fees; and
- Bring back the Sirens show.

Sadly though, it's prime has come and gone. Now, all I wanted to say was ""ARGH!"" We just got home from a four night stay at this hotel in Vegas. I won't lie, the hotel did it's job, but it should have done better. It should have been like how I remembered it. Oh well.

What I liked about the hotel: the price. It was more than reasonable for the strip. It's location. It's right next to the Fashion Show Mall and across the street from the Palazzo and the Wynn. This hotel is the home base for Mystere, one of the best shows in Vegas. The rooms here are pretty nice. The standard rooms are a little on the small side but they have a nice flatscreen tv and a radio with a dock for your ipod. That was a nice touch.

What I didn't like: the service. Aside from the guy who dropped off our bags in the room, it seemed like everyone had a damn chip on their shoulder. The people at the front desk were very rude when we were checking in. I mean these are the first people we see and the first impression means everything. We lost money here. I know, I'm sure everyone does but it's upsetting. Also, there aren't any good restaurants here except for the delicatessen.

You will leave with your bags lighter at the end of the trip. Our team stayed at TI for a conference and while I was out for a few hours the first morning of our trip, my iPad and digital SLR were stolen from my room. When I realized that my room had been ransacked (the intruder left drawers open and opened the closet to try and access the safe), I immediately called hotel security and filed a report. They took my information down and told me that risk management would be in contact with me in 4-5 days, despite me stressing that I would be leaving on a red-eye the next day. Feeling uneasy about receiving any resolution, I went down to the front desk to speak with a manager. They told me there was nothing that they could do that I needed to speak with risk management. This was repeated over and over like a broken record. The following day, I called security to try and get an update and they offered no further support. I was told again that risk management would handle the situation. He did provide me with the number to risk management and I left a voicemail after repeated attempts to get a live person on the phone. Feeling frustrated, I took time away from the event that I was attending and went to the front desk again, hoping to seek a sliver of assurance that my situation would be handled with care. I spoke to another manager who gave me the same run around - there was nothing that he could do and that I needed to speak with risk management. Wait until Monday, he said. He proceeded to ask me if I had my report number on a pink slip of paper, and a copy of my report. This was news to me as I had received no such information - which only heightened my feeling of being lost in the shuffle. My stay at Treasure Island was my first and last. Should you take the chance and stay at TI, you're putting yourself at risk and will receive absolutely no comfort from hotel management even if you've been robbed blind.

Arrived at McCarran and promptly realized that the hotel doesn't offer a shuttle, bummer. Forked out $40 for the round trip ride.

The rooms are not equipped by design which meant we had to either go without or rush down to the coffee shop and pay $$ with the rest of the hotel guests and hopefully get a seat or go outside to Starbucks and wait in their line. Starbucks won the toss, 2 coffees $15. On to the gambling...never won more than $10 at a time so we quickly gave up that idea. Didn't use the pool as we have one at home. Thought about going to the House of Blues and take in a Billy Idol concert but after researching tickets @ $380 for two people, we abandoned that as quickly as the gambling. Could not think of anything we wanted to do! Freemont street meant another $40 round trip and dinner at the Stratosphere's Italian restaurant would have also been another $40 round trip. The first night all we could hear were sirens and the music from the pool. Slept maybe 3 hours and that's being generous. Woke up, made it down stairs to the coffee shop where we split an Omelet for $18 and decided, screw this.

-Vanity in the main room was fancy and large mirror, great for ladies

CONS
-Shower is extremely narrow and small. Not alot of room to move around due to an ironing board in the shower. Standing straight at the showerhead is a challenge. This puzzled me because bathroom itself was big....

From the moment I stepped into Treasure Island, I was not welcomed with  any kid of friendly service. They made it seem like they were doing US a favor (for doing their job). Upon checking in, the concierge was very unprofessional and rude and told us we needed to wait thirty minutes in order to pay an additional $40 to check in. That was fine with me, because we did get to the hotel a bit early, but it could have been handled in a different and friendlier tone.  We asked if there was any way to have our luggage stored for thirty minutes, while we got something to eat, which brings me to the next unfriendly and most unprofessional employee I came across. 

We went outside to the bellhop area and came across an employee, who stated his name was Mike.  He told us he would be happy to watch our luggage and gave us a stub, and gave us the directions on once we check in, to call the number to have our bags delivered to our room. He stated that he ""works off tips"" and if we are ""happy with his services"" to provide him with a tip.  I told him we would be more than happy to provide a tip and to please be careful with our four pieces of luggage because we had valuable items stored.  My friend and I were not expecting for Mike to say, once again, that he would appreciate a tip. My friend and I were appalled that someone would be asking for a tip, when no services were being done thus far. We are more than generous to tip employees once they have provided a service for us, which would be...receiving our bags into our room after they were being properly stored and taken care of.  Mike stated that because we had valuables in our bag, that if we were to tip him, our luggage would be safe.  Mike threatened our valuables, which is not okay at all.  My friend and I walked away to go inside to get change to go and tip Mike, because we felt threatened and were scared that our luggage would be tampered with\/not watched\/etc.  Having an employee threaten us to provide him with a tip is definitely not okay. This by far was the most unprofessional employee I have ever came across in my life.  

I am a club member of the Venetian, Palazzo, and M life group. This time, I wanted to give Treasure Island a try. The only thing positive going for them was their location. I was completely dissatisfied that my friend and I wasted our money by staying at this hotel.  I had emailed treasure island to let them know how unprofessional their employees were, and how appalled I was to be treated like that. I never heard back.

You get to use the fitness center, get free wireless, and a newspaper.  This is ridiculous.  These are things that other hotels, outside of Las Vegas, don't charge for.  The fitness center is only opened limited hours-- it closed at 7 p.m.  it's not large enough to accommodate all the guests that want to use it during peak hours.

And we don't gamble.  So, when my son gave us a Xmas gift of two nights at Treasure Island and a show, at first I was confused on how I should feel.

As it turns out, the show was the Cirque du Soleil, Mystere.  And it was showing in a theatre inside the casino.  That had possibilities since we would also not have to worry about parking. And the show was magnificent.  I can really appreciate the permanent stage, customized for that beautiful performance. Some evenings, there are other high quality acts going on.  Gotta give those acrobats some time off to re-charge, you know.

We arrived late Sunday, which it turns out has multiple advantages.  First, the traffic was all leaving LV.  We skated in.  Yay.  Secondly, since the masses were gone, I believe we ended up with a far nicer room, upgraded to the upper 5 floors (had a special designated elevator!) only because we had requested adjacent rooms so we could be next to my son's room.  Nice desk clerk. Beautifully maintained surroundings.

The room was very masculine, with black modern furniture, decorated in soft browns and autumn colors.  It was a gorgeous, spacious room that had a big picture window looking out on the strip. The bathroom, also, was quite large, with plenty of counter space and an attractively tiled shower-tub combo. And we had a fridge. No coffee maker or microwave, but that would do fine, since we usually don't use them anyway.

Just so you know, they do charge for wifi.  Fine...we didn't need it. I only needed Yelp on my phone.

This was a wonderful experience, happily\/partially financed by Groupon.  The seats for the Cirque show were moderately low end, but still good.  After I took out the retail value of the entertainment, I figured we had stayed in our upgraded room at Treasure Island for less than $40 a night.  Not bad.

Had a great time, loved our room, even though I still hate the smoky casinos.",6,0,3

The music at the pool can be heard in our room but that was done by 10pm. I wish we would have gotten there earlier to go to the pool.  We enjoyed walking around the strip and ended the night at Gilley's which was so fun!  Can't go wrong with good music, line dancing and drunk ladies trying to ride the mechanical bull.

This visit the hotel seemed to be feeling it's age.  The rooms were more worn though still very spacious and received a strip view room for the first time which was awesome view. Comfortable but definitely aging.  About half of the escalators or other mechanical items were out of order, basically if you could get up, then down was stairs only or circle to another area of the property.  Staff was friendly enough but no real enthusiasm or providing much in way of overview of features of the hotel, just hurry you on your way and move on to the next guest.  We were supposed to get some kind of champagne service free but nothing in the packet from the front desk explained how it worked so never bothered.  

Valet is a joke. Not enough staff and either poorly trained or poorly paid.  5pm on a Friday and they had two lanes open, one guy working and he forgot about the second lane.  You had 5 guests who waited 30 minutes to get service and another 15 cars that were served within 10 minutes, just depended on if you were in the unlucky lane. Morning was just as bad though plenty of staff working. Had guy that took four tickets, dropped one and didn't remember how many he took so left guest waiting for 30 minutes. Found the ticket and tried to hid fact it was lost, didn't bother to apologize and still had 10 minute wait to pull the car up.  

On the upside,TI is very conveniently located to reach fashion mall and several other casinos. Parking is easy and casino is easy to move around. On downside, not that much in comparison to other hotels to get you to stay and dine or play, more likely to head out somewhere more fun. Or with better food. Even places like Gilleys had older crowd who was mostly eating and no real excitement. The island grill had best crowd though didn't make it there to eat. 

Gambling was low key, didn't play much but slots and didn't win enough to keep playing for long enough to count.

Reasonable priced hotel, comfortable if older rooms, and convenient location would be reasons to stay. If looking for young crowd, high energy or exciting dining options, look elsewhere.",0,0,0

- Location - connected to the Mirage by tram (easy waking distance too). You also have walkways to the Fashion Show Mall, Palazzo\/Venetian and the Wynn\/Encore are on the opposite corner. All this to say you have access to TONS of restaurants, attractions, etc. 
- Rooms - we had NO issues with housekeeping or any of the other issues mentioned here on Yelp. The room was clean and comfortable. LOVED the size of the bathroom. Plenty of room (it seems a new theme in hotel design is to skimp on the size of the bathrooms and you no room or turn sideways to close the door. Lol!). The room itself was nicely furnished with a empty fridge to use, which was nice to have. 
- Restaurants - although Kahunaville is now closed  there is still plenty of selection to chose from. Senior Frogs is awesome and so is Gilley's. The buffet is so nice. 
- pool - the pool is great! Loved the DJ and plenty of deck space. The pool isn't as big as others but nicely kept with upgrade options for seating e.g. Cabanas and luxury loungers. The only frustration we experienced is they do not allow outside food and drink, even if you buy it from one of the TI establishments. 
- spa - beautiful place and it is well equipped with steam room, sauna, whirlpools and lounge areas. Prices are also reasonable to other spas. 
- resort fee - I know fees aren't ideal but I love the way TI breaks it down and demonstrates the value you receive. I don't think any other resorts do this. 

The only other recommendation I would make to TI for improvements is their ventilation system. TI seems smokey compared to the other resorts especially compared to Mirage or planet Hollywood.

I have to first say that this hotel had the most comfortable beds I had on a vacation. Pillow top mattress with large comfy pillows I was very happy after traveling from the east coast to a comfy bed. The rooms where spacious clean and modern. We had a great view of the strip facing the Mirage, Venetian etc... The negative was the noise level coming from the pool and our neighbors next door.  
All in all we had a great stay. This location could not have been better! A quick tram ride to the Mirage, walk across the street to the Venetian. Shops to the left of the hotel. The Perfect strip location. 
Restaurant wise I have mixed feelings Kahunaville was awful. Awful food and drinks.  Phil's Italian Steak House was delicious I stopped by for a quick bite and had the scallops and a side of asparagus. The food was delicious my only complaint was too much butter.  Beyond that the meal, drinks and service were very good.  Room service after hours menu is pathetic I should have just waited for breakfast or walked across the street to Dennys. The regular room service menu was very limited but the food wasn't that bad. I had the decent steak with french fries, my sister had a grilled chicken which she refused to eat due to the large amount of butter. 
The bar in the front center of the casino was a great meeting place. Good drinks and great environment... waitress could have been more polite and it completely blew my mind they kept reminding us to tip them....  Being told to tip someone immediately took their 25% tip down to 12%! 
The pool was nice however I do have major complaints about the pool #1 there are not enough chairs, Saturday we had to put our personal items on the side and sit on the ground. #2 understaffed wait staff they need to hire double the amount of waitresses they currently have. 
Kids - I know this is not an adult only hotel\/casino but the kids need to be sectioned off. In the restaurants, casino area, POOL area everywhere. There should be sectioned off areas so the kids are not a witness the debauchery that is happening around them.

The room size is decently sized with dual queen size beds. I had the deluxe room, and I picked whatever room was available during the check in process. I had a shared wall with a shared door - while I could hear people speaking, it was difficult to understand. I just drowned out the external noise with my laptop speakers. I did notice stains on my work chair - but I'm not going to complain too much about it. 

I just covered it with pillows to make the chair more ergonomic to work in. Without the pillows, the lack of ergonomics can be a concern for those who type a lot - it can become painful to the wrists or shoulders, or lower back if they are not aware of their body posture. The pillows does help out - but doesn't eliminate the problem. 

The curtain does block all of the external light from entering the room, perfect for when I need absolute darkness for sleeping. The AC works well and there's a small fridge and a safe. I used the fridge to keep drinks cold - never did test the freezer capability. I did notice the lack of conveniently located electric outlets.  

Seems that there were only one available in the most unusual spot, away from the work area, and away from any place to do any ironing. Speaking about ironing, the ironing board cover could be replaced - it's showing its age. 

There are a few Starbucks located in the area. I counted two indoors and one outside. This hotel is located next to a 24\/7 Walgreens, perfect for those trips to acquire basic traveling necessities. 

The sound of the Siren show is annoying during the evening; the window could use better acoustic insulation. The noise from the hallway is noticeable - people in their drunken ways wondering through the hallways. Good thing I have ear plugs to remedy these noise issues. 

Overall, not a bad spot to stay in Vegas, and on The Strip as well. 

Tip: Check-in process is a total mess during after 11AM, or even 3pm, or even 5pm. There's lots of people checking in. Suggestion for this, plan to wait a while in the lobby, or just drop your stuff off at the Bell Desk, go amuse yourself in Vegas, and come back later, such as 7pm or 9pm.",8,3,3

Review #4:
well, it's mediocre, as you would expect; still carries traces of its Disney-type heyday, particularly the Strip-front pirate ships (which are actually kind of cool), so there's a fairly high family\/rugrat factor here; but most of the restaurants\/bars are more adult-oriented, albeit tacky & touristy (Gilley's, Senor Frog's, Kahunaville); it's overall a pretty nice place and low on the smoke smell; seems smaller than most of the Strip casinos, so you run out of places to explore fairly quickly here; best craft beer bet = believe it or not, Gilley's has a few decent selections, including some Alaskan Brewing Co. beers on tap, and Abita beers in a bottle.",1,0,0

The only good thing is that if you are on a budget, this place is located right across from The Venetian and Palazzo and down the street from Encore and Wynn. For me personally, I don't need a nice room in Vegas since the whole point of being in Vegas is to be out and enjoying everything and not be stuck in your room.

Understand it was a saturday night stay ... and I booked it at the last minute 2 days early.  They were UNDERSOLD so such a fine place could be had for cheap - and the place was indeed ""light"" for crowds.  So if this was so good for $ and service, free room upgrade and just a miserly resort fee to contend with - why only ""A-OK"" three stars?  

Because it had nothing desirable for dining on property.  The pool area was too cold to visit.  The overall size and variety of the property was limited compared to many other superior properties.  So it was not hitting on all cylinders for me\/us.  It was competent but just not enough to ""wow"" us up to 4 stars.... although I dare say it approaches 4 stars.  Clearly it was not leaning into 2 stars.  But gee - they stopped doing the FREE Pirate shows on the big boats out facing the strip years ago - what an anticlimatic disappointment?  Chuckles....

So for the money it is excellent - if you want your vacation to truly be memorable and your budget is comfortable spending up to $200 a night including resort fees and taxes - I know we could have gotten many other properties with clearly superior facilities and refinement.

    me i dont know, probably 
  (goes away to a far corner to talk to manager lady)
   (comes back)
 agent : so did you pick up the bug after you killed it.
 me: no absolutely not
 (goes away again, returns after 5 mins)
agent: you will have to wait here. The security will be here to escort you to the bathroom where they will look for the bug.
me: wait a minute, did i ask for money back? did I ask for a refund"" Nothing ! I just wanted to report that there is a bug of some kind. 
Agent: you are free to leave any time madam 
(STRIKE 3 )
Me: you know what you gotta be kidding me!!!! Your attitude is really bad. Are you insinuating to my face that i am lying. I mean why should i, what can i get from it. I got bitten and you are asking me if i saw it killed it picked it up. Really!!!(i walk off)
 
never before have I faced this situation and it was such a dampener and made me so upset!! I kept thinking what was it that someone had to nerve to be so rude. Anyways, if I could suggest one thing to TI, fire the agent and the manager who put her in a front desk position. She is not people friendly. Again, all it takes is a friendly  kind word .

Later as i read other reviewas, i realised TEHRE ARE beg bugs and still tehy treated me like crap. tehy knew about it and still put me there to be bitten while taking so much money.

Additionally :
around midday the bathroom (which has inadequate ventilation) starts stinking.

in short, never going back. Specially pay ""RESORT FEES"" and then get bug bites all over and be called a liar, no thank you.",0,1,0

We went on President's Day Weekend and we chose the TI because it was the least expensive hotel. We figured it was going to be tacky, but the rooms were actually very nice.  The bed was extremely comfortable and we had a pretty nice view of the strip. The staff was also extremely courteous. 

The Casino and restaurants themselves are pretty tacky. I wouldn't stay there to eat or gamble, but I'm basing my review strictly on the rooms. The rooms are comfortable, nice and somewhat modern.  The best thing about staying at the Treasure Island is that you are walking distance from the Palazzo and Venetian.  They are right across the street.  You can also take a little walk to Caesars Palace and My absolute favorite . . . The Cosmopolitan.  

BEWARE of the Resort Fees!!  If you purchased your room online through a different website, expect to pay a resort fee of $22.50 per night!!  Not sure why they would charge a resort fee, it's actually pretty lame, but a lot of hotels and casinos are adding this ridiculous fee.  Just make sure you take the extra cash because they expect you to pay it up front.

The casino isn't great, but it will do....I surprisingly did not play in the poker room, but my buddy made over a grand playing $1\/$2 and it is a nice sized room.

The food choices seem good, but act suck. I wish they had a cheaper option in there as well, but everything is priced the same, around $15. 

$20 resort fee or whatever is a complete ripoff, especially when their wireless sucked most of the time and then finally just stopped working the last two days.

We each got a single room with a huge king size bed for 327, including airfare, 5 days and four nights. We could not pass up this deal. It departed the day after thanksgiving and Vegas was pretty barren. 

When we checked it, the front desk clerk gave us a coupon book good for many free items, including some things located right at Treasure Island. One of the items was a coupon good for twenty five dollars in slot play up the street at the Stratosphere. There were also free meals, BOGO buffets, two for one helecoptor tours of Hoover Dam, ETC.

The rooms were huge, nice and clean except for one thing, my toilet didn't flush, I called the front desk and they apologized and sent up a bellhop to get my bags and upgraded me to a suite. What a great suite it was too. Nice living room area, walk in closet, and giant bedroom with a california king sized bed. I could travel like this a lot!

Great casino here at TI, I found the slots to be pretty loose, the blackjack dealers are extremely friendly, and, they have a great sportsbook.

The only other time I had been in Vegas, we stayed at the Venetian which is not the fairest of comparisons given that they are catering to a different crowd.  All around, I was very pleased with Treasure Island.  

First off, the staff is great.  When we checked in we reminded the guy helping us that there would be three of us staying and so we would be paying a bit extra.  He told us that he appreciated our honesty because most people do not tell them that and comped the extra person: honesty is its own reward I suppose.  Also, the concierge was very helpful and friendly when we talked to her about maps.  The cleaning staff was good as well, though we couldn't seem to get clean glasses very often, which is usually a problem in hotels at any rate.  

The room itself was pretty nice.  It looks like TI might have recently gone through a bit of updating as a lot of the room looked relatively new.  Our room had a good view of the Strip though the window was pretty small.  The beds were comfortable, the bathroom updated and large.  For the price we were paying it was a good room, though not as nice as what you'd find at a place like the Venetian or Bellagio.  

The casino floor is pretty bland and the table games never came down below $10 dollars while we were there.  I know that that is pretty standard but Harrah's had some $5 Blackjack and Roulette to pull you in.  The restaurant selection was also underwhelming and we ate out most evenings.  We did try the buffet because we had vouchers and while it was decent, it doesn't even begin to compare to some of the higher end ones at places like the Wynn.

there's one big king size bed and a very long L-shaped couch that can comfortably sleep two people. you can also request additional rollaway beds if you've got a lot of people cramming in. we also had a nice partial view of the Sirens show from our suite and could see fireworks go off periodically during the night shows. the suite was definitely spacious and i'd definitely recommend it.

the only one picky detail was that there was only one tub and one shower...it would've been nice if there were two showers instead. regardless, the suite was nice, spacious, and although it wasn't super luxurious...it was just right. definitely had some fun times hanging out and drinking before going out on the town. i'm sure i'd come back again soon...unless i can find a suite somewhere else with two showers along the same price range...",0,0,0

The fact is, there's 15 other hotels with pretty much the exact same rates and rooms as TI. So, if you can get a deal, go for it. I got one on Vegas.com and the strip view upgrade was basically free, so I took it. My husband loves pirates, so that's the main reason I chose it over the other 15 hotels with pretty much the exact same rates and offerings. I will say the hotel has done a major overhaul. They no longer refer to themselves as ""Treasure Island"" but as the more swag-a-rific ""TI"" instead. With the name change came the demise of about 90% of the pirate themeing they once had.

Service: The lady who checked my friend and I in was super helpful. We explained to her that we would like adjoining rooms if possible, or at least as close as possible. She paged through all the rooms for a solid 10 minutes trying to find us linking rooms. Eventually she apologized and told us she looked through everything and the best she could do were 2 rooms on the same floor. Not exactly what we wanted, but I really appreciated her trying hard to find us something. 

Rooms: The rooms were totally fine. They must have done an upgrade within the last couple of years because the furniture was updated, but the bones of the place showed some age. The room was totally clean though, and the BED WAS GREAT!!! Because the bed was so comfortable, I would consider re-booking TI over another hotel of similar rates in the future because I know I will be comfortable. 

Location: The location is okay. It's towards the end of one side of the strip, so  a walk to somewhere like Flamingo is going to take a while. There's a shuttle that goes back and forth from Mirage. I prefer the location of somewhere like Planet Hollywood or Caesar's (more centralized) but it wasn't terrible. 

Food: Upon check-in I received a voucher for buy 1 get 1 free at their buffet for ANY time. I dug that. We decided to go to ""brunch"" the Sunday we were there. The wait was about 15-20 mins. We thought it was pretty good, and it was a champagne brunch for only $24 for TWO of us with the voucher. They had a lot of choices, and I would return to their buffet even if we weren't staying at that hotel.

I would probably try a new hotel next time within the same price range, but I definitely wouldn't rule out staying here again if I got a good deal.",1,0,0

Umm, here's a tip, TI:  hire some staff that will at least flush the toilet between guests.  They don't even have to fold the TP into that little triangle thingie - I don't really care about that.

Pros:
-Deals! All the time. Sign up for their e-mails or constantly check the website. It's super affordable (especially if you're going with friends and are splitting the cost). The last time I went it was about $70 a night.
-Great location: near almost all the schnazzy places on the strip. Right across the way is the Venetian\/Palazzo and the Wynn\/Encore. You're also right next to Fashion Show Mall. You can walk out of TI and be surrounded by a bunch of hip things; it's awesome.
-HAND DOWN THE BEST BED I'VE SLEPT IN. I've been to other ""nicer"" hotels on the strip, and TI's beds make you feel like you're sleeping on a bed of marshmallows (but not sticky). The pillows are great too. The rooms overall are decent, and the bathroom is average in terms of amenities. There's a flat screen TV with a good amount of channels.
-Gambling: Lots of slot machines
-Good service from housekeeping and staff in the casino\/concierge.
-Pirate show!

Cons:
-Doesn't have super fancy areas within the hotel like the Bellagio or the Wynn does (nope, no waterfalls, sorry).
-It holds one of the older (and in my opinion, less intriguing) Cirque shows. But hey, you can even get a great deal on the show for staying in TI, so it's all good.

I just really like this place. Maybe it's because after a long day of being in Vegas it's nice to fall asleep on something that feels like my own bed at home.",1,0,0

Secondly, we will never stay at this hotel again or recommend it to anyone due to how the hotel management handled the situation.

Arrived on a Wednesday morning. Check in had no line and it went by very smooth. We were on our Anniversary vacation so the lady that checked us in was able to give us an upgrade on our room to a strip view as well as a complimentary bottle on champagne. She had also given us a few coupons for things located in the hotel, She was great. I believe her name was penny? We was also able to check in a little early at 1pm with no early check in charge. 

However i did not like the smell of the lobby \/ hotel. Every time we would walk in the hotel it would always smell so muggy and have a very strong cigarette smell everywhere you go. But most hotels smell like that right? 

My boyfriend and i enjoyed our stay here at TI. It was walking distance to the Venetian, Cesar's palace, Flamingos, Bellagio, Wynn and much more other hotels. It is also close to The fashion show mall which was great. 

They also have a monorail that takes you over to the Mirage hotel. It does get very hot during the day and wit the monorail it really helped a lot. It beats walking outside. 

VALET:
We rented a car while in Vegas and another great thing is that they do FREE valet. Well of course all you would need to give is tip. Which isn't bad at all. 

FOOD:
We did not eat at any Restaurants in the Hotel. But we did get a few drinks from Senor frogs and it was a bit pricey. $32 for 2 footlong freeze drinks, and mind you we used the buy one get one free coupon. We also went to starbucks located outside and that was your average starbucks. 24\/7 CVS and Starbucks was great. 

ROOM SERVICE:
Upon checking in we added a $80 for $100 purchases on food. Ordered Room service twice. Once for morning and Once for dinner. Breakfast was good, I had an Omelette and my boyfriend had the Pancakes. Dinner was also good, I had the Beef Pho and my boyfriend had to Cheese burger and fries. We were both satisfied. However it was a bit pricey. The food ranges around $15 - $40. Plus they charge a additional $9 service fee. But we still had a great experience. 

POOL:
Unfortunately we did not visit the pool, But we did see the pool everyday. Always had a lot of people and i believe a DJ would play music through out the day.

ENTERTAINMENT: 
We seen Mystere and that was great. We never did see a show in Vegas so this being our first, it was a wonderful experience.

After tons of research I decided on Treasure Island - the cost, it's location on The Strip, the amenities offered, and food & entertainment options were perfect for our group so I felt that I had made the right choice!

LOCATION - Treasure Island is on the Northern part of The Strip, right in the middle. It's directly across from The Venetian, The Palazzo, next to The Mirage and a little walk to the Wynn and Encore. There is also a Walgreen's across the street and a Starbucks next to the hotel. Fashion Show Mall is also across the street.

ROOMS - The boy and I stayed in a Deluxe Room. Upon checking-in, we were upgraded to a Strip View room and had an amazing view of not only The Strip but also the pool! The room was clean and spacious, as was the bathroom, however I wish the toilet was separate from the shower for obvious reasons ;P Beds are beyond comfortable - so hard to wake up in the mornings and from naps! iHomes, flat screen tv's, blow dryers and refrigerators in the room. 

POOL - It's FREE! Just gotta show your room card. The pool is pretty small but did the job, especially if you don't want to pay for pool parties. There is a bar outside and also a DJ playing music till close. There's tons of chairs but if you don't get down to the pool in time, you are stuck with the ones in the shade. Cabana's are also nice, but obviously cost money.

DINING\/ENTERTAINMENT - Many different options inside the hotel\/casino ranging from moderately priced to expensive. I recommend Kahunaville, ISLA's, Phil's Italian Steak House, and The Coffee Shop. Skip the buffet unless you have the voucher, which is only good Monday-Friday. As far as entertainment, they have the original Cirque du Soleil show, Mystere, but unfortunately I didn't get to check it out. They also have the Sirens of TI show outside, but it seemed pretty cheesy.

CASINO - I'm not big on gambling, but I did spend some time in the casino since my boyfriend likes to. The ventilation wasn't too bad in there but could be better. It was a little hard to navigate around there, but after awhile it was easy to get around. Tons of blackjack tables, slots, and virtual games. 

SERVICE - Check-in was fast! I was so scared we'd be waiting in a Disneyland-esque line, but we were checked in under 10 minutes. The staff was really helpful and nice. Our rooms were cleaned everyday and overall had no issues!

We really enjoyed our stay at Treasure Island and will definitely keep them in mind for my next Vegas trip!",7,5,4

That was our first time in TI. We just book this Hotel for the location, friends of us stayed at The Venetian where we've already been so we decided to try a new one and we saw the TI had a really interesting suite with jacuzzi "" Petit Suite"", so we gave a change despite than the bad reviews in everywhere. My husband is a gambler, I love enjoy the amenities of the hotel, so what a perfect deal I was thinking.
Let me start with the check in where the lady at the front desk said than she doesn't have any room with good view for us. Ok, we stay just one night. No problem! As soon we arrived in the room we didn't have any time to check the room because we were starving. so let's go to the buffet, call our friends and met at the buffet where the food was good but the  service OMG inexistent. No one server in all the place! Ok. Let's go back to the room just for relaxing while my husband goes to play. What a terrible surprise found hair in all my hot tube, and dust in everywhere in my room.Dirty suite??!! Never happened in any casino, come on is a Suite not a regular room!!! So call the front desk and they soon give me another room. I just had one day and I don't want do that, I was imagine just a relax in my hot tube. Anyway moved to the other room I found a beautiful view and clean place. Now my question is why 3 hours before the lady a the front desk told me than she didn't have a room with view??!! 
Also my husband than usually is happy in any hotel casino was disappointed because in the high limit table didn't found a good bar service.
We just tried this hotel for one day because we are going to Vegas at the end of the month for celebrating our anniversary and my birthday and we want make sure that was a nice hotel for us before booking for 5 days. Now we know, we will book another hotel.
Sorry TI but your reviews tell the true, I don't recommend this place!",3,1,0

I thought everything was going good until the next morning my boyfriend told me that about 2:00AM  one of the employees or so he thinks let herself into our room!  She opened the door with a key and my boyfriend ran out of bed and yelled THE HELL ARE YOU DOING??!  She mumbled something and left,  and then my boyfriend went back to sleep!  You would think he would flag her down, but noooo.  I'm a super heavy sleeper so I didn't hear a thing or else I would have thrown a big deal with her.  I complained to the front desk and all they said was that they would look into it and do a lockdown of our room.  Well nothing became of that.

It could have been some crazy person with a key to our room who could have stolen our belongings!  The whole thing just pissed me off.

THERE ARE BETTER PLACES FOR THE MONEY.
MANAGEMENT IS NOT IMPROVING ANYTHING, THEY HAVE A CASH COW AND ARE MILKING IT!

Okay sorry for the caps but, I wanted to get your attention. You're here because you're looking for a place to stay when you come to Vegas. My advice is not to stay here.

 We stayed here via the Hotel room finding service, called ""hot wire"". This is a service where they do not tell you where you are going until you have paid for it.  After this experience I'm not really a big fan of it. 
What I can say about this place that it is ""nice"" and just that, nice.  It has a decent location, but they're simply treading water.  I really don't know how else to put it.
The room wasn't terrible, but it was a long way from the best I've ever gotten.  The service is ok, but it's nothing special.  So, I rate it as ""nice"".   I don't want to do it injustice, like saying it was less than that, cuz it wasn't, but at the same time, for someone to come to Las Vegas to have fun, to cut loose, have a nice time, there are much better places than this! 
The most annoying thing is that it seems to me that they know this and are running this place just to get the money, not putting any real effort forward to be one of the standout destination hotels in Vegas.   The Pirate show, all of the small things that were here before to make this a place I'd want to go to, are now gone. This is just a hotel on the strip, owned by large corporation, running on their past fame.

I will also add as an aside that this has happened several times with hot wire, I will no longer use them.",3,1,2

This place also doesn't have much quick grab and go food that's not a donut or horrible pizza. They do have a CVS,  and the location is good, just a short walk to so much. Also the room it's self wasn't great, very hard mattresses and someone else's used cotton balls in the bathroom when we arrived. At check in the front desk agent wasn't very friendly to either of us. Our room was at the very end of the 14th floor with very slow internet and loud doors slamming at all hours. This is an older hotel but so is the Luxor and they make it fun! I much prefer the older Vegas spots that have the hotel off to the side or the newer spots with better ventilation.

The line to get checked in took WAAAAY longer than it should have. But!!! We slipped the lady a $20 with our ID and we got a room upgrade...SCORE!!!! So, I highly recommend using that trick at ANY hotel you stay in while in Vegas, it works 99% of the time. 
The casino is smaller, smells like cigarettes. The only bar that was open 24\/7 was the Breeze Bar...it's OK...pretty small. The ""club"" that they have is the Christian Autiger Night Club. It's only open Thursday-Sunday and of course...we weren't there any of those nights, so I'm not sure how ""hot"" it is. 
The buffet they have is very average. I've watched shows on the Food Network about how awesome Vegas buffets are, and well...they didn't go to TI for sure! Its...average. The only restaurant that I felt was news worthy is the deli that is located by the elevator. It's called Canters. Our sandwiches were worth the $13. I got the BLT and it was PACKED with bacon! Such a plus!!!! 
The pool is small and there isn't anything uniquely special about it. This is a family spot so expect kiddos to be running around instead of hot ladies and gents.

The rooms are clean and relatively quiet.  We've been placed on the ""mountain view"" rooms to limit the booming sounds from their nightly pirate show in the front of the hotel.  We had a room facing the strip and you can definitely hear the booms.  

Normally we eat at the caesars properties or go to the outskirts for food so I can't comment on the offerings here.   The casino is relatively small but it's great to wander around if you're with someone and split up because the floor is small you'll be able to find and meet up easily.

Beds are super comfortable though the rooms are on the smaller side. I usually stay at Aria, but I found this to be okay for a trip with a couple of friends (more drinking, less upscale trip). 

Location is next to the Fashion Show Mall, Wynn\/Encore, Venetian\/Palazzo, Mirage and Caesars. I'd say all of those are about 5-20 minutes at most. It's cool if you like the North Strip but after staying at Aria so many times I've learned I prefer to be in the middle.

Walking into the hotel I was surprised by the smell. And I do mean that in the nicest way possible. Most hotels have that clean but smoky smell to it (part of the Vegas charm I suppose), but TI has a nice flowery smell to it, and yes, good smells make me very happy. I have been to TI other than once or twice in the many many trips I've had in the past two years, so I didn't really know what to expect.

The room was a good size for four people. The bathroom counter had plenty of space for all sorts of toiletry items. The room had a more modern set up, dark wood and what not with lots of clean lines. The flat screen was a little on the smaller side, but since we weren't planning on spending most of our time in the room, it wasn't a big deal.

Cheryl Y. got a special rate for the room (her being a card member and all), so at the check-in desk they gave us a voucher for one of their bars for a ""buy on get on"" cocktail. Nice touch considering we didn't spend more than $90 per night.

The best part of staying at TI is that shopping is quite literally right next door.

Back in the middle of June, I as a savvy traveler contacted Treasure Island through its Twitter account. The reason was that I wanted to know if the hotel still allowed I guests to waive the resort fee if they received the hotel through an opaque travel site. For example on Priceline if you bid for a 4 star hotel and are awarded Treasure Island.

Treasure Island verified that this is still in effect and a few days later I bid on Priceline -- and did indeed receive Treasure Island (like I said I'm pretty savvy). However at check in on Saturday the 23rd, I was berated and humiliated by an assistant front desk manager (Mr Sheehan) who based on his incomplete knowledge and a quick call to reservations refused to honor stated hotel policy. This was even though I provided my Priceline confirmation, showing the word offer which means bed, and also a printout of the hotel's proprietary Twitter posts that validated.

This situation got even worse when I vociferously objected and asked if my situation could be reviewed further. I was threatened with removal from the premises and or not being allowed to check in to my prepaid room. As such under duress and under protest, I was forced to initial that I understood the resort fee pricing structure, & I sign my name with the words ""under protest"" alongside that to time stamp my circumstances. Otherwise I would be out on the street in Vegas for my weekend vacation.

Further, the manager tried to make this Priceline's problem - even though Priceline provided me a confirmation number for successful winning bid in Treasure Island decided that it would not honor its previously stated policy. the manager was clearly not serious at attempting to resolve a genuine issue because, had he been serious, he would have taken my paperwork from Priceline and Treasure Island Twitter, and escalated it to his supervisor or another management representative. It's not so much the 50 or so dollars, it's the principle in terms of a multi billion dollar entity not honoring its policy and also extremely humiliating me.

As the manager instructed me that nothing could be done and was threatening my opportunity to stay in the hotel as reserved, I accepted the room keys and then did try to address this issue. Both by Twitter to the hotel's Twitter account and email to Guest Services and Marketing. However, apparently Treasure Island does not believe in monitoring its email or social media entities on weekends even though most of its business comes on weekends.

So I am in this situation right now and wanted to documented in a timely manner and also a respectful chronological manner as it has been one day since the incident occurred.

I travel quite a bit -- this is approaching 50 nights away for this year -- and I have never ever ever been humiliated and demeaned by a hotel or travel organization like I was on August 23rd. In fact this really ruined my mood for what should have been a very exciting and relaxing getaway weekend.

Yes, weekend getaway at Treasure Island totally ruined and personally humiliated.

Hopefully this can be addressed and resolved by the appropriate folks but if not and this is how the hotel treats its guess, I thought that folks should be aware. Maybe this is the one exception and not the rule, I sincerely hope so for the other guests, no one should go through the situation that I went through.

P.S. Stephanie at the front desk during the initial part of the check in process was exceptionally helpful, cordial, and efficient. She was a joy to deal with and I'm sorry if I may have put a bummer on her day as I know it was the beginning of that day.

Update of of 8\/25 (review originally written on 8\/24 a.m.) -- TI Twitter folks did respond to me on Monday morning and said they'd look into this.  Then it was implied as Priceline's fault for not showing an opaque bid win code on the res, and I was asked for more documentation and Priceline apparently has been enlisted.  At checkout (normally I do it electronically), I went to the front desk to receive a final bill and verify if the resort fee charges were present.  When I matter-of-factly stated that it was under review (the Twitter folks had said so), the rep got hostile, requested my documents, and began to discredit\/disparage me (I was not asking her to review it or complaining). As I was about to leave, I attempted to take a pic of the rep's nametag (didnt want to write on bill but did want to fully document my experience details, incl. people), and she threatened me with Security removal for doing so (I'm leaving, luggage in-hand, huh?).  Then I arrived home to en email from the Marketing Dept (which did not respond to my polite ""please help"" 8\/24 email) that it was cancelling my future November res because of these ""incidents.",7,0,0

Treasure island updated their rooms. They are on the small side, including their bathrooms although the shower is a good size !!! I booked a standard room. 

The maids were always prompt and the rooms were not only tidy but CLEAN. Meaning sheets were not stained, there was no dust, it was what you want when you pay over $150.00 a night for a room. 

We ordered the typical drunk room service at 5 am and the food was decent, prompt. 

Elevators were SUPER fast, clean and they had the elevators in sections of the hotel which was sooo nice so that you don't have to walk a mile on your floor to find your room and also, the elevator is never packed.

At first I was POed that a lot of my colleagues got to stay at much more upscale hotels\/casinos but I was pleasantly surprised with the TI hotel and casino...

The Pros:
Nice location across from the Sands Convention Center
Updated modern rooms clean comfortable beds
Starbucks on the first floor
Couple of good restaurants on the property.. Liked Isla Mexican and their Vietnamese restaurant both were very good. Couple of people did the buffet and said it was OK... I'm not a buffet guy so...
Gilleys bar off the lobby is a good place to have a brew and watch the tourists get tossed off mechanical bull.
Casino has low minimums which is OK
Not staying at the hotels attached to the conference center meant I was out of the bedlam of trying to get a coffee in the AM or a drink in the PM with the thousands of exhibitors and attendees...

There are Cons:
Yea if I was taking wifey for a romantic getaway weekend the TI would not be choice number 1 or 2
As someone earlier mentioned the casino is smokey but others on the strip are just as bad
Make sure you request a room that is not facing the strip and their nightly cannon show.. I mean everyone has to sleep a bit even in Vegas.

They say it's $30 more to get a strip view, but if it's low season, you might get the upgrade if you're very very nice.

There is a skybridge that connects to Fashion Show Mall; go to the half-priced tickets counter at the Mall to get discounts on shows, including the onsite show Mystere.

There are so many things I loved about this hotel. First, if you stay here, you are steps away from what I consider the best Cirque du Soleil shows in Vegas: MYSTERE. I have a separate review for that. On to other things I like:

The pool isn't incredibly large, but definitely refreshing. More than enough towels to go around, and the poolside bar has friendly and engaging bartenders. The Caribbean tropical theme is alive and well at the pool, which made me feel like I was truly in a desert oasis. There is a young, hip feeling to the place, and not thousands of kids like you might think would be there. If you had a large group with you, it looked like it would be fun to rent a cabana for the day (about $250 during the week I think).

The casino area is attractive and not too large, unlike Caesar's or the Mirage. I always felt like I had my bearings there. The general layout of the hotel is pretty easy-flowing and the front desk provides you with a map. In general, I was very pleased with the front desk; they upgraded me both times I checked into the hotel (long story), and there are free coupons for 2-for-1 drinks.

I did not eat at any of the restaurants or get pampered at the spa, but the samples from WET (the spa) in the room were very delicious-smelling and luxurious. The hotel is going through renovations (when are Vegas rooms not...?). I stayed on the 34th floor, and the view was divine, but don't trust my words alone: see the pictures.",6,1,3

I got the feeling that they are definitely moving away from the ""kid friendly"" vibe this place used to have.

The pool area was decent... went there mainly for the kids. Just a pool\/cabana's.

The resort fee is a bunch-o-crap .. I don't care if it is now the industry norm. You book online and pay for the room, then they hit you up for more money when you get there? Bad business IMO.

Yes, I understand it's a busy weekend...yada,yada,yada. But is this the way to run a business? Definitely not coming here again and letting everyone I know to avoid this place like the plague.

I honestly have no complaints, other than a somewhat bland buffet, but even still, we had a 2 for 1 which the front desk gave us.  No big deal.

Free parking (if you're from LA you'll understand how nice it is to park your car and not have to pay!); check in took 5 mins; nicely themed casino.  Was much nicer than I thought it would be.

The beds are SUPER COMFORTABLE!  I can't remember the last time I had such a good night's sleep.  The rooms are super nice and modern.  Nice shower with an oversized tub.

It's not the newest or flashiest hotel on the strip, and as long as you don't expect Bellagio levels of luxury you will not be disappointed. 

The one thing that I'd like to note here (and another thing I loved about this place), is that it's not ridiculously crowded like most of the other casinos.  Because there is no mall, etc. attached to it it is not nearly as insanely crowded as other properties.  This I loved.  It is certainly busy, but you aren't ""over it"" in 2 hours.  Walking around Caesars, The Venetian, Cosmopolitan (admittedly nicer hotels) I got tired of quickly because there are always people in your face.

Would definitely stay here again!

One bummer:  The pirate show has been permanently discontinued :(.",8,0,1

I got hooked up here on multiple occasions!  I got upgraded to a premier suite, luxury suite, and a penthouse on 3 separate times. It was newly remodeled, so the rooms were very nice and clean. 

Food:
The restaurants here are mediocre and don't get me started on the buffet.
1) Kahunaville
2) Pho - overly priced for wack pho and service!

Casino:
Low limit, so you if you have a budget for gambling, TI is pretty good place to gamble.  
Poker room - extremely small and not worth playing there. There's never a good amount of people playing.

Service:
Quick with room service (ie, rollaway beds, towels, cups, etc...)",0,0,0

Had seen complaints about long lines to register but it only took us about 10 min. (There were 7 CSRs working). I hadn't realized there was going to be an extra $22 per night for the ""resort fee"" when we booked and pre-paid 3 months earlier but after reading online reviews was not surprised when they hit me with it. They've gotten smarter probably because of all the arguing from guests and provided a list of dubious benefits which no longer includes the pool or VIP area of the Sirens show (since there is currently no show). I managed though to get them not to tie up my cc with their cushion for ""incidentals"".

We were able to get non-smoking and two beds as requested. The room was clean (we do the bed-bug check immediately) and though there was an odor of mildew in the bathroom, I decided not to complain about it because I was too tired and the smell didn't extend outside the room into the bed area.

At midnight when we were back in our rooms, my son tried to use his laptop but it was taking 5 minutes for the simplest of pages to load if they came up at all. Since the damn ""resort fee"" covered internet access, I finally called the front desk The guy who answered was polite and didn't seem surprised by my complaint. He said that probably too many guests were online as well. Someone delivered an ethernet cable in about 15 min. It didn't help. 

Pros:  quiet - didn't hear much in the hallway and only a little of the family next door through the adjoining door.
          clean - no funky smells
          beds - COMFY
        adequate towels - not exceptionally soft or fluffy but not too thin either
          easy access to and from parking garage to strip, highway, etc.
          great strip view
          ice machine clean and funtional
          housekeepers were all friendly
          elevators adequate - no long waits
          Canter's pastrami sandwich was a winner according to the man-          child
           easy, quick, polite check-out

Neutral:  tv remote and wireless keypad were noticibly dirty (sticky) but    I always clean and disinfect anyway.
              don't drink coffee so the lack of coffee maker is fine and doesn't   take up real estate

Cons:  whatever foulness of a scent they are piping in to the casino at the entrances\/halls is possibly a deal-breaker for a future return. I hate smoke but this concoction of both just makes it vomitrocious and a misery leaving and returning to the rooms. (I noticed that the Palazzo seems to have the same feature happening so note-to-self to do research for possible Feb 2011 trip).
            resort fee - if you're gunna charge it then just put in all into your    quoted rates
            poor internet access although it did improve after the first night
            some levels in the garage had large areas of standing water
            the up escalator to the garage was not working when we were departing - had to haul my butt up manually - no small task (no small butt)",1,0,0

Then again, I am used to sleeping on memory foam beds so this could be the case. I agree with the others about the Coffee Shop service and food quality. However, there were a few times when the service was really great so it probably depends on what server you got.  The music is totally awesome that they play when you walk back from the Fashion Mall. I didn't get to see the Sirens of TI show though because it was canceled due to high winds two times I tried to see it.  Valet was a bit slow but that's everywhere in Vegas. They were going as fast as they could. I recommend self-parking when staying at TI.  You can't beat the location of TI as it's right by the Mirage, Caesar's and across from the Wynn.

The only down side of the room that I could pick out was there was not a refrigerator.  I mean really TI!!!!.  

Another downside of the hotel is the pool was on the small side compared to alot of the other hotels on the Strip.  The casino itself was ok  nothing to brag about.  I did not visit any of the restaurants based on the reviews that I read.

Not sure if they were going for a tropical bar smell or just trying to cover up the smoking odors... however, none of the other hotels had this issue. We ended up spending most of our time away from our hotel primarily for this reason... I just could not stand the smell.

The drink and food prices were very spendy (as with most of the strip). The best deal was the buffet ... look for the buy 1 get 1 1\/2 off deal.

We wanted to play some of the tables, but we are not big spenders when it comes to gambling... we were thrown off by only seeing $10 on up minimum bet tables.

Also a complaint that I have in general (not just TI) is I miss the chink chink chink of the coins.  I was turned off my using vouchers for my gambling... I might as well stayed home and played my computer games... Much cheaper and enjoyable.

Needless to say we only lost about $50 between the two of us gambling in Treasure Island... if they would fix their gambling payouts and minimum bets then I am sure we would have lost much more.

My advice to you... if you can stand weird odors and price is an issue then TI may be for you... Myself, I will never return there. I will spend the extra money and stay at a different hotel that has better gambling and no strange odors that makes me feel sick every time I walk through it.",0,0,0

Nowadays I'll book here when I have to go on a quick trip or if I'm on a tight budget.

BASIC is the one word to describe TI. It was one of the mainstays in the 1990s and early 2000s, but as soon as the big boys started coming in, it sort of just fell back in the shadows.

However, if you're not looking to spend for some of the higher tier hotels but want to stay above some of the lower end joints (Flamingo, Harrahs, etc), TI is one of your better picks.  Rooms are clean and simple. The pool is comfortable but far from luxurious.  Casino leans towards mid-lower limits, so if you want a clean yet affordable place to gamble. the TI would suite your needs.

Also be sure to tip the representative at check-in. Super easy to get a strip view upgrade from the basic room and TONs of coupons (BOGO buffets, comp drink, etc)! 

My biggest complaint would be the lack of a nightclub. I like to pick a hotel where I can just drink beyond my limits on one of the nights of my visit and be able to walk right upstairs to my room and knockout. They had the Christian Audigier Nightclub a couple years back, but it closed down. 

This review didn't really sell TI as your Vegas destination haha. But if you just want a clean room to crash at, it's a great value. And the location is top notch. You're right next door to xS, Tryst, Surrender, Tao, and 1OAK Nightclubs, so you'll save a ton on cab fees.

Beds were comfy, the bathroom was clean and spacious and the hotel room was very quiet. Also theres a free show in front of the hotel and Treasure Island guests get special VIP viewing.

Location: The hotel is located right next to Fashion Show Mall, theres a tram that takes you next door to the Mirage, and also its a short walk to the Wynn and Venetian across the street. Its not in the middle of the strip, but it is definitely centrally located to some of the best hotels in Vegas. 

Price: Not bad at all, I believe we paid around $129 for 3 weekday nights including a Friday. 

Service: Friendly, checking in there was a long line but checking out was no problem at all. The information desk is also helpful and was able to print out our boarding passes for us (there is a charge but it is super convenient).

We stayed in one of their deluxe rooms which included one king bed, a desk, and... that's about it! There was no fridge (excluding the usual overpriced beverage fridge), bathroom was decently sized but nothing to boast about, and the room itself needed an update as it was pretty dreary and uninviting. We had asked for a late checkout (usually around 3:00PM) and the front desk said it would cost $100 PLUS tax! Likewise, be prepared to wait in a long check-in line!! If you decide to pay an extra $50 they'll allow you to check-in early, if not, be prepared to wait until 3:00PM!

Resort fees were $28 and included access to their gym (which wasn't all too impressive to say the least and closes at 7:00PM), wifi access for TWO mobile devices ONLY, two for one coupon for their buffet, and a few drink coupons.

The few positive things about staying at TI?...It's on the strip and there is a free tram that takes you to and from the Mirage Hotel. It's also walking distance from the Fashion Mall and the Vietnamese Coffee Shop\/pho restaurant inside the hotel is pretty decent for those late night munchies! The Cirque du Soleil show, ""Mystere"", is also located inside this hotel and it is decent for the price. We paid around $30 for our tickets at those 1\/2 off stands and thought Mystere was ""OK"" but nothing compared to ""KA"" at the MGM (my personal favorite) or ""O"" at the Bellagio.

As the saying goes, you get what you pay for. Yea, the rates may be lower compared to other hotels but, in all honesty, I'd much rather fork out the extra money and stay somewhere nicer like the Wynn, Encore, Caesar's Palace, Palazzo, Vdara, Cosmopolitan, Bellagio, or even Aria!

The smoke from their room seeped into our room through the service door, as well as into the hallway. As a result, our room had a very strong smell in it. While the bell desk did send someone up to spray our room and warned our neighbors not to smoke, the reprieve from the smoke smell was temporary. After leaving our room for a few hours, we found that our neighbors had smoked yet again, stinking up our room and requiring a second visit from housekeeping.
To make matters worse, despite our pleading, we were told that we would not be able to change rooms until the following night. As a result, we were forced to endure a full night of the stench of drug smoke.

It is understandable to not want to embarrass your guests by ""busting them"" for bad behavior (after all, Vegas strives to be an adult playground). If a hotel is going to allow such bad behavior in a guest however, it should not be at the expense of another guest. If someone wants to stink up there room with smoke, so be it, but don't make us have to suffer through it too.

*No cover for TI guests at Christian Audigier the Nightclub

The bad:

*Lackluster food and nightlife options.

         I'm a 33 year old engineer with a graduate degree and have been serving the US Navy for almost a decade.  I rarely complain about services I pay for, so I am a happy customer 90% of the time, but my experience with Treasure Island Hotel in Las Vegas was absolutely devastating and the worst service I have ever paid for in my life.  I had to write this letter since no one from the hotel's direct management team has been neither responsive to my issue nor cooperative.  Please read my story below if you think you can help or if this could affect you.  
         On Friday 17 of Feb 17, my wife Sarah and I decided to celebrate Valentine's weekend in Las Vegas. We had not had a romantic getaway since our beautiful baby (Sophia) was born eight months ago. We were extremely excited for the trip and enjoyed the drive from San Diego, CA. We checked in at The Treasure Island Hotel and Casino (on Vegas Strip) Friday night of the 17 of Feb 17 and we were planning on checking out on Sunday 19 FEB 17. We also were very excited to see Circus Du Soleil show in the same hotel for Saturday night since we paid for the tickets as part of the hotel package.
        On Saturday 18 Feb 17 around 5:00 PM, the fire sprinkler systems in our room was accidentally activated. I am tall guy (6""4) and I was moving my hanged clothes from the bathroom to the closet when a hanger barely touched the sprinkler setting it off (I found out later that the sprinkler had no casing around it even when regulations clearly mandate it). Water started pouring and the room was flooded in no time.  Sarah panicked and went outside screaming for help. It took maintenance and management over 15 min for them to show up and shut the water off. It was too late and water damage had already occurred in the room by the time they showed up. Our personal belongings were damaged as well (clothes, cell phones, and laptop). It was a nightmare and what made it even worse is how the hotel security and manager treated us.
           Firstly, the hotel security and manager were extremely rude assuming that the incident was intended and that it was our fault.  They all marched into our room completely infringing leaving us no privacy.   We were treated like we just committed a crime. I asked for privacy since I was wearing only my underwear boxer briefs and needed to change quickly into something dry, but they bluntly stated that they're not leaving the room.  One of them was a really big bouncer who clearly threatened us that if we don't willingly pack our stuff, pay the damages, and leave the hotel (even though we paid for that night), he was going to forcefully and physically throw us out on the street.  We were completely wet, startled, and covered in some kind of black chemical that came out of the sprinkler with the water, so the idea of not even being offered a room to shower and change into dry clothes was just shocking to us. On top of all of that, they prohibited us from attending Circus Du Soleil show which was happening that same night at the hotel auditorium, which I still cannot understand why until now since Circus Du Soleil is a separate company and our tickets were paid! 
          We had no choice but to give away our show tickets to a stranger, take our stuff, and get into our car completely disappointed and livid. This was around 8:30 PM Saturday night of President's Day weekend, so everything was sold out or $$$$\/night.  After about 2 hours of calling hotels, we were able to stay in a low stars Inn for $200 and drive back to San Diego the next day.
        Today 23 FEB 17, I received a bill from Treasure Island Hotel and Casino for $7056 for room damage. We are given two weeks only to pay the full amount or they will send the bill to collection. I honestly do not have the money and I believe we were treated so horribly with zero customer service. We were forced out the hotel in the most disrespectful way possible before our check out date wet on a cold and windy winter night, they did not let us go to the show for which we had pre-paid tickets, forced us to find a cheap hotel room for $200, and claimed that the incident was our fault charging us 7 thousand dollars! 
        We could not be more disappointed with the way Treasure Island Hotel and Casino treated my wife and I. No one deserves this treatment. My wife and I are both highly educated (Masters degrees) and we both professionals working for the Federal Government. 
I will never step a foot again in the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino. I do have pictures and videos of the room and the way we got treated from the hotel staff.

Enough about my problems, the question is, will I stay at t.i., fka Treasure Island again?  

The answer: Yes.

While t.i. is not a 5 star resort, it is a solid option for something mid-grade, decently priced and centrally located on the strip.  It was a perfect spot for a bachelor party that was not spending a large amount of time in the room.  It also begs the question, if you're in Vegas, why are you spending any time, besides sleeping...errr, passing out, in your room?  There are funds to be lost at the tables and drinks to be had!

Highlights:
1. The Coffee Shop was a great morning and late-night stop for food.  Decently priced as well.
2. The pool had a good amount of talent walking around, though 1 in every 2 gals had a tattoo.  And  of those tattoos were tramp stamps.  Sign of the times I guess.
3. Location, location, location!  It's a quick walk or taxi ride to all the hot spots on and off the strip.

Lowlifes:
1. The maid service was slow...if it even showed up at all.  While they did a decent job at cleaning the room, they forgot to re-stock the towels (among other things.)  A call to the housekeeping desk did not get it done either.  Swiping some from a passing maid cart was how I did not have to drip dry on my ensuing shower.  
2. The buffet was just gross and over-priced.  I've never been a big fan of buffets anyway and this confirmed my prior beliefs.
3. The Sports Book:  I wish they read a book on how to make a good place for watching and betting on sports.

Keys to getting the best price:
1. Booking online with the hotel directly or calling the hotel directly had the best pricing.
2. If you are a AAA Member, you can get a 10% discount off your room rate.  Though you do need a separate AAA card for each room.
3. Book early!  The hotel was sold out by the time we had arrived and the rooms were over $150 more than the price we got it at.
4. Want an extra bed?  A single sized rollaway is only $20\/night.",2,2,2

Another bonus was the radio\/alarm dock in the room so I was able to play my music from my phone while we were getting ready to head out. The gross part was that my comforter had these nasty looking stains on them! At least swap them out for a comforter that doesn't have stains! Yuck!

STAFF: Besides the bartender eyeing every drink we ordered and double checking to make sure we were playing MAX bet, the staff was friendly and attentive.

What I do like about T.I is that I was able to sign up for a slot play and I actually came in third place and won $150 credits on my T.I card, whoo-hoo! I took my credit to the high limit slots and played there and won like $200! Totally made my last day in Vegas! 

T.I was just ok for me. It's at the end of the strip too. Would I stay here again? Most likely not unless it's free!",3,2,2

1) location
2) price
3) comfy bed
4) easy to navigate throughout the casino

The room
Stayed in room 35065 with views of traffic and Fashion Show Mall. My room was missing 2 lamps and a hair dryer. Lack of lighting will make your makeup application a hassle, so pull up a chair in the bathroom. The fridge was broken. 

The service
Omg the check-in line moved slower than my airport and the TSA line combined. Took 2 calls for housekeeping to deliver a hair dryer, but at least they came... 1 hour and 15 minutes later.. after INSISTING I wasn't looking hard enough. Also, if you're staying for just 2 nights they will replenish your towels, but will not clean your tub. It's a soaking tub too, but not as big as I had hoped it'd be.

Comfort
Loved their bed! Hated their pillows - it's much too high\/fluffy for my bf and I (I'm 5'3"", he's 5'9"") The heater is quiet. No water sounds from your neighbors!

Location
This place is small enough that you won't get lost while sober. If I was staying at the Venetian, I'd somehow end up in the Palazzo and can't find my way back to my room.  I like TI's tiered elevator system which probably goes from level 1-15, 16-30, and 31-36. Up the escalators will take you to the bridge which crosses to Fashion Show Mall. Across the street is the Venetian and Palazzo, where you'll be able to have better choices for dining.",0,0,0

When we arrived, our rooms weren't ready despite our request for early check in and calling in before hand to confirm. That was somewhat annoying because we were on a time crunch to set up the room and decorate it with panties, phallic-themed goodies and all the bachelorette fixings. 

Regardless, we were able to get in after a 45 minute wait in the lobby.
ROOM:I was surprised to see how renovated and nice the rooms were. Usually you don't think luxury when you hear ""Treasure Island"". I was expecting just very plain décor, but the rooms were nicely furnished, clean, spacious, and had modern décor. They looked newly renovated! 
The three rooms we booked were adjacent, so it was a large suite basically with a total of 3 beds. Also, I forgot to mention that the lobby offered 3 bottles of champagne (one for each room) as an apology for the late check in. Not too shabby. When they delivered the bottles we had finished decorating the room and hung up the bridal panties by the door so I'm sure the room service guy thought we were funny lol. 

POOL\/AMENITIES: We rented a cabana by the pool for our party and the service from our waitress was excellent!! She was so sweet and so attentive. They have beer pong tables to play, lots of lounge chairs to lay out on, and the cabanas are close enough to the pool yet far enough for some privacy. The food was SO good!!!! I ordered a kale salad and it was ENORMOUS and super flavorful. Everyone rolled their eyes that I got a salad, but those beezys were taking it all back when I let them try the delicious salad. The other girls ordered pinwheels (mini wraps), stuffed jalapenos, fruit, and other finger foods. As far as I remember, it was all really good. For drinks I ordered a canned coconut vodka that I saw on the menu. I also got eyerolls because of that. But hey guess what, it was also BOMB! Ingredients were just unsweetened coconut water and vodka, and that's it! the waitress put it in a cup with ice and she threw in fresh fruit and viola! It was amazing. 

NIGHTLIFE\/RESTAURANTS: 
They have a senor frogs here at TI so we decided to eat there the first day (lunch). It wasn't too packed and there was a air-balloon lady making us crowns\/hats. it was all in the name of fun. 
We also saw that they have a Latin Night on Saturdays so we came for that (we're a group of Latinas) lol. The line was CRAZY long but we had a bachelorette, and just went to the front of the line, perked up the girls, and got in no problem LOL.

Room was clean and well taken care of while we were there.

TV had issued that never really got resolved after a couple of attempts by the hotel to fix.

Breeze Bar staff very hit and miss.  Sat and watched some Sat FB while playing Video Poker at the bar....with free drink coupons and credit for playing cost my companion and I only $5 overall.  But the bar tenders on a Sat afternoon are far from energetic or engaging....just going through the motions.

TI Buffet is one to avoid.   Got two free passes when checking in but only good Mon-Fri so we decided to use them for a late dessert on Fri evening but ended up snacking on other items as well.  It was close to 10pm closing time so did not think much of Buffet being sub part at that time.  Then had BOGO that we used for Sun Brunch with free Mamosa's....breakfast was no better than later dinner.  Overall spent $30 on four total meals and still feel a little disappointing.

Checked out the Sports Book on Sunday before leaving to get some scores on the early games and found this to be the smallest and least accommodating SB on the strip.  The big screen TV's on the wall look like they are from the 90's and still 4x3 aspect ratio, low definition rear projection from the looks of them.  Could not even read the scores on some it was so bad.

2.  The bedsheets had margarita salt on it.  Did they even clean the beds?  Minus a point.

We had a double queen room with an awesome view of the strip. The beds were SUPER comfy and the bathroom had a huge tub that I indulged in a couple times. 

I dont gamble but my friend did (and she won big!) and the waitresses were super nice. We also met some VERY drunk men that let us put our drinks on their growing bar tab :) 

The only place in TI that I ate was the pho place....that was a pretty sub-par experience. I had to hunt down the waiter and we barely got service after that. I ordered the lemongrass beed vermicelli (great flavor but not enough beef) and my friend had the chicken pho, which she said was mediocre. 

However, one of our girls ate a cursed quesadilla at the Hotel cafe...and got horrible food poisoning. It was so painful for her that she missed out on one of the best nights in Vegas history (at least for me and our other partner in crime). I felt so bad about this that I called the front desk the next day and told the front desk, hoping they would compensate with a free dinner at the buffet or Kahunaville...instead I spoke to a Cowboy-soundin' old man who wanted to send security up to the room to take an official ""statement"" to include explicit details of the physical symptoms of food poisoning (you get the idea of the questions he was asking). He also didnt know what a quesadilla was and pronounced it ""KAY-SAH-DILL-UH"". I was pretty much laughing out loud at the whole situation.

The only gripes are the cable options on the TV sucked and there was no fan in the bathroom. But other than that, I would gladly book at Treasure Island again.",1,0,0

First of all, it's usually cheaper than many of the hotels on the strip. Secondly, it's pretty center strip and you can easily walk to The Forum Shops or Fashion Mall next door. 

We were in Vegas during what I would deem an off-peak season but the check-in line was still crazy long. It moved fairly quickly however.

This was my second time staying here. The first time the room was very nice and the beds were comfortable but this time we had the most uncomfortable beds ever. Our fridges barely worked and the TV remote was out of batteries. If you do get a Strip View Room though, it's a pretty amazing view. 

There's cigarette smoke pretty much everywhere and you don't really have that nice perfumey smell that you get at Cosmo or Aria.

The rooms are very nice. Great views.

At night they have their pirate ship battle show. It's awesome. But can easily be canceled due to wind conditions. Don't want anyone getting hurt. They make up for it by taking pictures with the performers in the lobby. Something that would've happened after the show. I'd watch the show from across the street or maybe get there early.

I will never stay there again. The first room we were sent to SMELLED disgustingly like a wet, old, moldy towel. I seriously opened the door and didn't even take a step inside and I could smell an overwhelmingly strong musty smell. We went down and asked for another room. The clerk just said sorry and didn't even offer an upgrade or anything to make up for it. I've been to many hotels and whenever there is a problem like that the hotel will most definitely make it up to you. However, whatever they made it right I was willing to let it go. Except it didn't get better.
The second room was okay. The room smelled okay but the bathroom had a slight scent of mildew. Since I couldn't put my finger on what was wrong I let it go. By the end of the trip I realized it was probably the shower curtain that smelled. 
The tv was messed up. No matter what channel it was on it displayed a big 11 across the top, so I couldn't see what channel I was on and it was just annoying to watch tv that way.
The mini fridge did not work. The ""liquids"", after being there all night, were still room temp. Why advertise a fridge if it doesn't work?
On my second day there I was walking back to my room only to find a overwhelming musty smell in the hall. I think the maids were cleaning with a musty rag cause it was gross.

Fact that hotel is located very close to Fashion Show Mall, most of the people loved it.  Of course, there is a outlet and many fine retail stores are all over the strip.   One that I want to make comment is that, we were placed near the lower floors.  5th and 6th.  My room was on the 5th floor and even with the windows closed, I could hear a Air Condition Cooling tower's fan.  I am pretty picky about the noise.  So, I went down and asked them if I can get the room changed. The respond that I got was,  Flat out NO, reason being is that, because I came in as GROUP, the bell service already has the room assignment and they cannot accommodate the room change.   
The fact that the lady on the back of the counter didn't even try to change the room and didn't show any concern about the noise just made me angry.   I wasn't asking to change all the rooms, but just 1 ROOM out of 15 rooms that I reserved for my group.

They didn't have much for restaurants but that's what the rest of Vegas is for.  If you like to gamble, which I dabbled, the tables were inexpensive at $5 Blackjack.

When we checked in, the front desk guy couldn't have been nicer.  One of my friends had just celebrated her birthday earlier that week, and he wished her a happy birthday and said he would send up a bottle of champagne to the room to celebrate.  When we got to our rooms (on the 3rd floor which was less than desirable), we instantly smelled a horrible smell in one of the rooms.  It smelled like a sewage or gas leak.  We tried to move to another room but they said that they were full for the night and sent someone upstairs to spray the room with air freshener.  When we woke up the next morning, the smell was even worse and was giving us headaches.  I called the front desk and demanded we get our rooms changed.  It took them several hours to clean the new rooms, but we were finally able to change to a different set of adjoining rooms.  When we went to the front desk to get the new room keys, the guy who was helping us acknowledged that they were having a lot of problems with plumbing and other maintenance issues on the 3rd floor and he wasn't surprised we had a problem with our room there.  This was extremely frustrating to hear.  If you know there's a problem with a specific area of the hotel, then you should not put guests there and hope they don't complain.

That pissed me off and there was no way for me to cancel the extra room. However, a manager allowed us to stay an extra night and pay the difference.

I've been to Vegas at least once a year since I was 21 & while my bucket list is to stay at a new hotel each time I go, so far Treasure Island is the best for those who want economic luxury! 

Anyone who has been to Vegas knows that Memorial Weekend is crazy ridiculous and the prices for rooms at other hotels are mind blowing expensive, but somehow Treasure Island wasn't. I know what you're thinking, that I stayed in the worst part of the hotel, but NO! I got a room on one of the highest floors with a view of the Strip and the Pirate Ship & the room was upgraded! 

It's in close proximity to the Wynn, which is where I'm always at because I love XS, Surrender, and Encore Beach Club! There's a Starbucks right outside of Treasure Island, which is perfect for me because I need a caffeine boost and a little breakfast munchie to get the day rolling since I'm not a breakfast buffet person. The slots have always been good to me & don't forget to get a Treasure Island Casino Card because that's how you can receive MorePlay, sign up for their newsletters to get their best room rates, and get food comps!

Granted, it's conveniently located and it's been recently renovated to look relatively new and stylish, but the service here is horrible! So horrible that while I felt clean and comfy in my room it wasn't enough to outweigh this 1-star review.

This hotel was installing a new computer system during our stay, which understandably would result in some minor delays and kinks being worked out, but it appears this hotel management put NO thought whatsoever in how they would do the switchover.  For example:

 We had to wait close to 1 hour (yes, one hour!) to check in to our room on a Tuesday afternoon! There was literally about 50 people in line to check-in and not because the hotel was busy, but because the agents were so slow. Seriously, 3 agents for this size hotel when you're going through a computer system switchover?? Unacceptable!

 The next day on Wednesday night, I had to request a duplicate copy of our room key because I left mine in the room. BIG mistake....  I had to wait 35 minutes in the lobby just to get helped ~ and this was in the ""check-out"" line at 11:00pm on a Wednesday night! The check-in line was even longer. But the kicker was that the agent who helped me, while nice and courteous, had just started his shift and what did he do when I asked for a room key? He had to get on the phone for 5 minutes and call someone to find out how to print out a room key?!? Come on man, isn't that basically the entire job function of a front desk agent = to print out room keys?  

 Twice we tried calling the front desk to request a late checkout. Both times, we waited ON HOLD listening to the pre-recorded message for 20 minutes before we hung up in exasperation (luckily they have speakerphone in the room because you'll need it). 

 At checkout, they tried to charge us for the entire stay even though it was prepaid through Hotwire. This mixup took yet another 20 minutes out of our time. 

More cons: They couldn't even fix the bed correctly! All 4 nights that we stayed there, we got  really short ""fitted"" bottom sheets, and by short I mean that when we got into bed, there was a good 1.5 feet of uncovered bare mattress! It's not even like the sheet got loose or something. The sheets were just that short that either you could cover the head area or the foot area, but not cover both. What are they thinking? Most people in the modern world are over 5'0 tall so who do they think they can fool with these short sheets?

Our room had no remote control for the TV and we had to call maintenance to get one. After we got the controller, we then realized the cable didn't work either, so had to get the maintenance man back again to fix the cable. Ugh.

Oh, and TI now charges $20\/day as a ""resort"" fee. Pfftt... Well, it does cover free internet service in your room but when you're in Vegas, how much time will you actually be in your room doing work? For us, this was just a waste of $80 during our 4-night stay.

But sometimes, for some people, that can be a good thing. If you want to be in the middle of a million people anytime you step outside your hotel room, if you must have a gazillion restaurants right at your doorstep, and if you don't mind being sequestered at the far end of the Strip and waiting 15 minutes in the taxi line any time you want to go anywhere, go stay at the MGM Grand.  

As for TI, the location in mid-strip is extremely convenient and is probably one of the best things about the hotel. Parking is plentiful and free. The hotel is lively but not out of control; busy but not overwhelmed with people. Our petite suite was very nice and blessedly and remarkably quiet, even though the suites are right near the 'vators, and we enjoyed the jacuzzi tub and the large shower. (Not as luxurious as the Venetian suites, but much cheaper, too.) The clients at TI run the gamut from business folks to older folks to younger people looking to party and families. It seems like a good mix, nothing too wild but not staid and boring either.

I wasn't impressed by the food in the hotel. The brunch buffet was pretty bad. The Italian restaurant was just OK. The upscale Asian place upstairs has decent, if pricey, food and a wonderful outdoor patio, complete w\/a view of the Strip and the pirate-ship-portion of the crappy Britneyesque Sirens show. But the Pho restaurant was terrific - and a big bowl of Vietnamese chicken noodle soup is awesome after imbibing.

The other disappointment was the pool. We should have taken the tram over to the Mirage hotel pool, but we were lazy. The TI pool is small and at certain hours becomes party central, complete with really loud booming music and lots of drunk people waving around enormous drinks.

Location was great as its literally right off the freeway, across street from the mall and still considered close to main part of the strip. Best part of this place, FREE PARKING!! Majority of other properties will cost you $8-12\/day!! Check-in was pretty quick. Line wasn't too bad. Lots of employees checking customers in and were pretty quick at it too. It was also pretty easy to find the check-in area compared to some other ones that may be a maze to find it.

Room:
Got the generic room with 2 queens which is good as some hotels give you 2 full ones instead. This hotel is one of their older established hotels so it is a bit old\/outdated. I would help a lot if they did updated a bit, fix or replace some of the wear and tear areas and furniture. Most important is it is still clean and pretty spacious. They don't have a fridge in these rooms or maybe because its a generic room and not a suite so double check when you book. I do have to say that the walls between rooms are thin also as you can hear people in the other rooms and hallways. The room next door was pumping super loud music at 4am. We called front desk and they took care of it immediately and the music literally stopped which was great. The showers pressure was awesome!! Had it blasted on high heat on my back and it was so relieving!
Casino floor:
Pretty big hotel with lots of varieties of slots. Plenty of restaurants and retail as well. The Pho show was not too bad just super duper expensive because its in the hotel for your convenience. Buffet is meh here. Not too much selections on food or dessert. Except their creme brulee's are yummy, not worth paying just for that of course.

Overall, a pretty good and descent place to stay just for the free parking, location and convenience alone.",6,2,2

The location is pretty good. An indoor walkway leads you to shopping (Fashion Show Mall), to the latest & greatest (Wynn) and to the fun (Venetian).

The cigarette smell is stronger than at some of the newer hotels, but it only lingers in the casino. It never followed me onto the guest floors or my room.

The room felt comfortable, with the soft bed that everyone is screaming about on Yelp. The furniture was convenient, too, despite the fact that some surfaces (cups, walls, shower wall) were not cleaned as well as I'd like.

The food options are pretty decent. Nothing to write home about, but it's tasty and isn't too overpriced. The staff was very nice (at restaurants) and housekeeping is pretty prompt & helpful.

I enjoyed our stay here primarily due to the location. A comfortable place to rest was all I really wanted, with as few surprises as possible. To me, that was worth the premium in price.

My only complaint is the long check-in line that I dealt with on Friday afternoon. The hotel should be better prepared to handle the influx of guests or shorten the check-in process so that the line moves faster.

He comes up to your driver window aggressively and tells you, ""This must be your first time driving"".  I ask, ""What do you mean""?  He states, ""Because you were going too fast and you stopped in the crosswalk in the valet area"".  What a clown I thought, especially since the car is a rental, I take great care in driving in crowded areas and I was picking up my parents so I had to be careful and drive slow.  What upset me was that the taxis cut me off (one almost clipped me on the way out of valet\/pickup area), the taxis and limos bypassed me in speed through the valet\/pickup area and the taxis and other cars literally parked in the crosswalk putting me to shame- they didn't care one bit and I am a couple of inches over and I am the A-Hole, okay...  So I blew off this occurrence and thought...okay, maybe it will get better and one employee shouldn't spoil the vacation. 

How to make things better- check in for the Tower Suites was 3:00 pm.  My parents and me showed up at 3:30 pm and we stood in line for about twenty (20) minutes.  When we got to the front finally, the lady we spoke to was pleasant with us but she kept fighting with their system and called her managers multiple times because our reservations through Southwest Vacations was for non smoking rooms but at the time they only had smoking.  You could tell that the front desk staff were not happy- which was, well sad. After 30 minutes, multiple calls to management and awkward looks from other vacationers, mom and dad got to their room on 15th floor, and I got my room on the 32nd.  

Mom and dad's room looked like the picture posted online, my room looked anything but- my room looked newer and renovated, but it had its issue.  For my room, some jerk scribed their name into the window in my room, one of the lights did not work and was unplugged, there was a tear in the couch and stains on the hot tub tile.  For the parents- the fridge did not work well and they needed that to work for their medications.  What both rooms had in common- god awful, underpowered air conditioning- the rooms were cooking at all hours of the day.  The couches in both rooms were springy and the beds were terrible.  The folks had trouble with room service on multiple days- luckily, I did not have that issue and room service was on top of their job to their credit for me.

Throughout our time in the casino, interestingly enough - as much as mom and dad gambled, when we went to the Coffee Shop we were never informed that they could use their comps.  When mom and dad went into the Gift Shop- guess what, you can't use the comps there.  When checking out, there was no offer to use any comps that mom and dad had built up.  So if you are going for a TI card, I have no idea how their program works and hopefully you can find out because we got nothing out of it.

Upon checking out, I brought my stuff over to mom and dad's room.  We called for the bell desk so that our baggage could be held for a couple of hours.  When the bellman came up, I remember him stating, ""There will be another bellman, you won't see me again.""  He didn't leave until he got his tip ransom which was disappointing. 

The kind of positive: 
* The wifi was somewhat okay.  
* Checkout via text message was good.  
* The spa inside the room felt good- but it shut off every 10 minutes.  
* Free parking but very limited Handicapped spots on the 3rd floor bridge.  I learned just how important these spots are when you need them! 
* A CVS located in the property
* The cost of the rooms were very competitive with other properties 

I am disappointed.  Years ago I stayed at TI and loved it, but never again after this experience.  If the hotel got a makeover for the rooms, upgrade AC and bedding is a must, fix the terrible taxi\/pickup cluster in the lobby\/hotel area of the hotel and maybe made their comps program universal throughout the property- I think things would improve.",3,0,0

They have gone away from the family-themed hotels and back to the more adult-like theme, probably because it was not making them any money. 

Also, with the constructions of so many new hotels in the recent years, Treasure Island is not as popular as it used to me. Still, it is casual and nice.

Subject: more shockingly disappointed again
 

To whom it may concern:
 
What a woeful embarrassment for your establishment.
As a follow up to my last email, it is of sincere concern for how your operation is run for the complete ineffectiveness to achieve simple reasonable requests.
So after my concern of my multiple reservations potentially resulting in rooms throughout the hotel, upon check in, I reviewed exactly what our goals were to have rooms on the same floor. I was assured that although rooms cannot be guaranteed since room assignments are not made, they would block out rooms. 
So I am certain you can appreciate my frustration to find on Saturday that the rooms were now on multiple floors. I can continue on with what transpired for over 30 minutes to resolve the situation, the only resolution was for me to pack my stuff and move to another room. Clearly an unacceptable outcome.
Had the hotel been booked, or if I hadn't reviewed the situation in advance and been assured the success, things would be different. However the clear inability for this hotel to operate their system to avoid these gross deficiencies is unsettling.
So once again, I was left certainly dismayed and frustrated. This is the level of service one would expect at a low level facility. It is with great sadness for you I must give a one star review. 
TI should be embarrassed for themselves and I would recommend patrons stay elsewhere.
I am hopeful to never have this experience again in any of my travels.
 
You should be ashamed,

Subject: Shockingly Disappointed
 
To whom it may concern:
 
I booked a reservation for Friday 10\/21.
Confirmation: xxxx
 
I was so looking forward to coming I encouraged my entire party to cancel other reservations elsewhere and we are all now planning to stay until Monday at your resort in multiple rooms.
 
Due to wanting to stay on one reservation and keep rooms together, I wanted to cancel my 10\/21 room and just hop onto the other new larger multiple room reservation.
 
I was told I could not cancel multiple times by multiple people (including the supervisor), as I was told the reservation was non-refundable after 24 hours. I am surprised to get such resistance when the confirmation email I received said,
 
""Should you find the need to cancel your reservation, please notify the hotel at 1-800-944-7444 by 4:00 p.m. Pacific Time at least two (2) days prior to arrival. Cancellations received after that time will be subject to a fee equal to at least the first night's room rate and tax""
 
It seems reasonable that I would think I could cancel well after 24 hours if that is the email sent (which I attached)
 
I then asked about a rate change as the current published rate as your site boasts: BEST RATE GUARANTEE and RISK FREE RESERVATIONS. I had to ask multiple times and get to a supervisor to make the change, which was only $10. It was more of the point as we gamble thousands where we stay.
 
Needless to say, I am tempted to encourage all for us to go somewhere else as the way I was treated was clearly not heard. Had the reservation said ""non-refundable in the email"", this would be different. But as it clearly did not, I was repeatedly read fine print that I did not have, is not the way I would expect to be heard by a highly acclaimed establishment like yours.  
 
The worst part was I only wanted to cancel so I wasn't double booked as I was going from 1 room to 3. But again, the operators were more interested in policy and what their computers said than to listen.
 
I am hopeful this is read in the nicest of terms so you can accommodate other guests in a way that doesn't leave them angry and with a bad taste in their mouths. I come to Vegas 6 times a year and have never been shut down the way your establishment did.
 
Highly disappointed.

Bad: $22 per day resort fee is nothing more than a scam. For your $22 you get access to the fitness center, wireless internet, 2 for 1 LUNCH( B4 for 4pm) buffet (not good on weekends), local phone calls and a discount on a future stay. Fitness Center is tiny one of four treadmills broken, the 2 for 1 Lunch is set up so there's no way you'll use it. The dinner buffet is expensive and very average. Local calls included...kind of a joke. They only offer it because of cell phones. Who wants to use a hotel phone?

More Bad: There was a giant green spluge stain on the bed skirt. Would post a pic, but YELP doesn't do that.

This T.I. thing is bullshit. What happened to MY Treasure Island?

What kid didn't have a pirate phase? I was lucky to live in close proximity to the Mutiny Bay video arcade. It seems like it has been almost completely forgotten, which is sad. To be honest with you, I have trouble remembering it myself. The only things about it which are fresh in my mind are those creepy skeletons out front which intimidated me every time I came here and that it was a lot of fun.

What happened to it? About 80% of it was replaced with a wannabe Bahama Breeze like establishment. The other 20% became a theme-less hallway of games(so small and plain I'm not sure if it warrants being called a full blown arcade). 
And please, don't get me started on how they bastardized the pirate show.
The outside looks almost exactly the same, but they painted the tower mahogany and I actually think it looks nicer than the original pale orange color. Also, they changed one of the ships for the Sirens and fucked up *cough* I mean redesigned one of the coolest marquees ever so it would look ~hip. The inside is a totally different story.

I really don't have much to say that's negative about our stay at TI.  I found my favorite penny slots (the ones where you can actually bet a penny if you want) in the casino downstairs, we were close to many other casinos we wanted to go to, and our hotel provided us with a ""two-for-one"" discount for the Cirque du Soleil show ""Mystere"" (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/cirque-du-soleil---mystere-las-vegas#hrid:Ey-5kZKy2dmfgW1RlvqVqA) which is also located in the building.

I have two complaints.  One, there wasn't a coffee maker or a refrigerator in the room, though when we called the front desk, they were more than happy to deliver a small fridge to us. And two, the only Wi-Fi option was a paid service, which when ordered, was very unclear about whether you would be paying monthly for the service (you don't) and cost kind of a lot of money for a short time.  It would have been nice if our iPhones were able to get online, but there seemed to be a 3G block in our room (maybe others as well?).

Basically, our stay was fantastic all around.

The beds were awful. Like sleeping on a rock. We didn't even get a fitted sheet, only a flat sheet over a used mattress pad.

Saturday morning we went downstairs for brunch. We ordered a grilled cheese and wonton soup. The frys were cold and the soup was terrible. 

Saturday night I accidentally locked myself out of my room while trying to push the room service cart. I ran into a really nice man who worked there who called security for me.

We had a small problem with an overflowing toilet, to which after I shut off the water valve and stopped the water from reaching the carpet, we called the front desk, and they quickly sent someone over to take care of it, and they also ordered for someone to clean the bathroom and send new towels, which also cam very quickly.

The pool also opened for the summer the time I went there in March, which was awesome. Tons of lounges with pop-up flags to alert waitresses when you're in need of a poolside dranky drank.

So we hit it up and were really surprised. We had heard that the Wynn was good and the Bellagio was good, but we had no idea the Treasure Island Buffet would be any good!

They had a bunch of different styles around the edges, and from the prime rib to the deserts to the shrimp cocktail... it was all really pretty excellent. I think we even tried the wannabe sushi and were surprised that it wasn't as bad as we thought it would be. All in all, we left full and satisfied!

Then we went gambling a little, had a few rum and cokes to get us in a piratey mood. Quite a few drinks later, we hit up the 25 cent slots... and I won like $350!!!!

Since the machine was just going crazy, and so were my wife and I, a bunch of random dudes were looking over with jealousy in their eyes. One crazy old dude who looked quite like a retired pirate in rehab said, ""How do I make my machine do that?""

That jam gave me that added feel to this hotel, really that melody relates to that beachy tropical theme that TI has to offer, Wow... only if I had used their swimming pool outside I'd probably spot Nicki Minaj singing to the beats and following her rhythm, shoot! her song haunted me even walking by Serendipity because they played that song through their speakers and it also got us singing along Starships on the road trip back home.

We had the double queen bedroom that had the pool view, but we wanted a king bed facing the strip, that wasn't available.

The bath was clean and had a decent layout, flat screen tv, overall size of the bedroom was just right.

Mildly hip hotel, I see now why they shortened their hotel name to T.I. (nice marketing scheme.) Their casino here is not as big as other hotel casinos on the strip, but I don't gamble.

There were 2 bathrooms with a shower & a jacuzzi style tub.  There were plenty of mirrors which was a plus for us girls.

Cons:
-Wifi is only available for 2 people at a time & if there were any other devices that logged on, it would be an extra $10 (not sure if it is per device or per day).  This was a nuisance because my girlfriend was charged $30 for 3 days & when she asked what times there were 2+ devices, the worker stated all day for 2 days & at 1046a the day we checked out.  This was so frustrating because I was the last one in the room & checked out before 1046a & if I was there & used the Wifi at 1046a, there was no one else in the room that could have been using the Wifi with me for there to have been 2+ devices because I was alone.  Thankfully, she was able to dispute the last charge but we do not know if TI was lying to her to make her pay extra or if there really were 2+ devices.

When we arrived, we arrived at 9am, and I believe check in was at 3. So, we went to valet parking area and they have someone who will hold your bag(s), free of charge!! That way, you're hands free in Las Vegas! ;) they also bring your bags up to your room once you are checked in.
When time came around for check in, we got in line around 2pm just to see if we could check in a little bit early. We didn't get up to the counter until about 2:30, and got checked in no problem. We stayed on the 12th floor. 
When you get to the elevator, you must show the security your room key each time you need to go up to your room. So, have it ready! Anyway, we made it to our room and the size of the room was pretty big for two people. We got a standard king. Bathroom was big with a pretty big tub! In the closet of your room, there is a safe and refrigerator. Take advantage of the fridge, most hotels on the strip don't have them!!
The light in the closet is automatic, when you shut the closet door, the light turns off. Well for us, that's not the case. The light was stuck on. It was a little bit annoying, but that was not a big deal to us! Room was decently clean, saw a few missed dusted areas.. Not biggie. We had a little bit of a strip view and were facing the palazzo and the venetian. Then, the roof top of the check in area where all the lights light up the hotel at night. The curtains were great! Blocked all sunlight and hotel night lights! The pool was crowded, and there was just only one pool.. Had a live dj everyday and had a nice hot tub. Not too hot, thought. Felt like taking a bath. Lots of kids invading it, which could be a reason why it's not that hot. 
This hotel is in a great spot on the strip!! Also it's in a more quiet area of the strip as well.. If you want tons of people and lots of action, you might want to stay on the side over by monte carlo.

It did its job, but that's it.  Nothing about it wowed me.  It's in a good place on the strip, right across from the Venetian, but if you're looking to venture to the other end of the strip on a hot day, I suggest a cab.  The walk becomes a hassle pretty quickly when it's 100+ degrees outside.  The few complaints I had were these:

Please, please, please build a ""families only"" pool and ban anyone under 21 from the regular one.  I really don't understand the draw of bringing your underage offspring to Vegas, since they aren't allowed in the casinos or bars (which happen to make for 90% of Vegas), many of the shows are even 21+, and they create a constant annoyance for the adults who are actually trying to enjoy their vacation without having to dodge kids running through the hallways or banging on the walls in the room next to them (I experienced both).

My main complaint about Treasure Island is the pool.  You have a DJ playing club music with a bunch of people (mainly in the 21-35 age range) hanging around drinking beers and relaxing.  Then you have a bunch of toddlers in swimmies and a bunch of 9 year olds jumping and splashing.  Their oblivious parents?  Talking to their friends and not caring that their kid just jumped in the pool and spashed 5 people who are trying to have drinks and relax.  Seriously, the worst part of my stay at Treasure Island was going down to the pool every day and having to deal with the 20 or so kids in the pool doing whatever they wanted and just creating an annoyance to everyone around them.  They all congregate at the steps going into the pool because they are all so small they can't swim anywhere deeper.  Then when adults want to step into the pool they are forced to dodge all of the little ones with fear of knocking them in.  Really, bringing your youngens to Vegas is probably the dumbest thing you can do.

The 2nd thing that will definitely stop me from staying here again is the filtration system in the casino.  Last time I was in Vegas I stayed at Aria.  The minute you walk in Aria all you smell is vanilla.  This is mainly to hide the stench of cigarettes.  The vanilla is strong and gives you a headache at first, but you adjust to it pretty quickly, and after the first day at Aria I had no issues with smells of any kind.  Treasure Island is a different story completely.  By the second day my sinuses were history and I was blowing my nose and wiping my eyes every 5 minutes because the smell of smoke was so strong.  It was bad.  Really bad.  And a hotel that charged a $28 a day resort fee should be able to do something better about the smell of smoke, in my opinion.

One thing I can compliment is the staff.  Every staff member I encountered was very friendly and helpful.  The waitresses at the pool always had a smile on their face, the cooks at the buffet were always friendly and asked how you were doing, and checking in and checking out was a very pleasant experience.",0,0,0

It's a mid-range resort only interested in providing sub-par customer service and shuffling people through their cattle operation.   The check in experience was unnecessarily lengthy and the employees were rude.  

I had reserved a Petite Suite.  Upon arriving in my room I was surprised to see that it was nothing like what the pictures online provided.  It had a sad, hospital style bathtub rather than the large jacuzzi tub indicated in the listing.  I called the front desk and they indicated they needed to put me in a handicap accessible room due to availability (we not not require an accessible room).  I asked for a refund to make the room comparable to a standard room since we were not getting a true petite suite with the jacuzzi tub, and they only offered me a $20\/night discount.  I declined and opted to wait until they could accommodate us in a true Petite Suite.  But, I thought the way they handled the whole ordeal - NOT telling me that we were being put in an accessible room so that I might not notice and complain - was shady at best.

The room showed some wear.  And the music from the pool could easily be heard in our room on the 16th floor.

Will never the posh hotel like Venetian is, but very good rates despite it being in the middle of the action on the strip. 

oh, and there's gambling there too (hahaha, I'm being sarcastic). I felt there were not enough table games though there. Blackjack tables had mix of shoots and single decks. Poker room was small but very beatable players. Nice profit there. 

Service was good and Mystere (Cirque show) was very good. I think I saw the ""amazing Yan"" there.... ""we found a grease man!"". (for those who can't remember, it's a line from Ocean's 11).  :-)

I wanted to try a different hotel after the Bellagio was disappointing and Bally's was too road worn for me. Having last stayed at the Bellagio where I paid 3X the price, I was so pleased with ti. 

We came for a weekend in April. We're not gamblers, so there will be no review of the gaming facilities. We arrived late on Friday in a rental car, the self-park lot is so easy to use, once you find it (the roads and driveways between ti and The Mirage are a bit of maze...it took us a few tries to find the easiest route to the garage. The pedestrian walkway to the hotel was very easy to use.

We do enjoy the Vegas experience, walking, dining, and general exploring. Check in occurred late on a Friday night and after waiting for 35 minutes in line, April was friendly, professional and efficient getting us checked in. We had a Strip view room on the 19th floor, I couldn't have been happier. The view was amazing and mesmerizing. We could lay in bed and look out onto the Strip to watch what was going on.

Honestly, the room was nicer than I expected. Considering this hotel is over 20 years old, our room had clearly been updated. The main part of the room had a Kind-sized bed, a fainting couch, nice sized bed-side tables (I want to find bedside tables like these, they had 2 huge drawers each, I loved them), a desk\/chair and another bureau with plenty of drawers. 

Fabrics were nice, plain white sheets for the bed (this seems to be the standard for most hotels worth their salt) and king-sized pillows (I ordered lower pillows and provided with 3 smaller pillows, 1 feather pillow that did the trick). The carpet had a design to it that seemed to show more lint than it should, it seemed like it could have used a thorough vacuuming. The AC was powerful and on 100% (with temps in the 60s outside), we turned it off. 

The bathroom was larger than I expected, lots of space and very nicely finished. 

Strangely on our last night, housekeeping had changed the bedding and left us with only a top sheet. The resort fee is not optional (no surprise). The wifi was okay the first two nights but I could not connect the 3rd night. 

I had a cold (respiratory problem) during my visit and I could really tell the casino floor was quite smoky when we emerged from the elevators. Other casinos clearly had much better smoke removal systems.

We loved having a Starbucks just around the corner from the elevators, though double-priced Starbucks is hard to stomach. We also enjoyed the pool, the furniture was comfortable, the music very pop-y, and the pool was perfect.

Wish they still had the pirate show, but Vegas is constantly changing with something new every time. It's an easy walk across to the Palazzo where there are plenty of restaurants. There is a breakfast place and some other restaurants in TI itself, but super pricey, even by Vegas standards, so wait and see where you really want to spend your money. 

It was easy to get a Lyft from here which is good because I know it's harder to do ride sharing here because of the cabs. I split a hotel room with two other friends for two nights so it was pretty darn cheap.

The pirate show that my daughter looked forward to so much doesn't happen anymore. Bit of a downer. On the bright side the staff that we have all met have been very friendly except for those in the Instant Millions kiosk. We were told no obligation to buy(as my wife agreed to speak to them) then I put my foot down and said no we need time to think about it. I was kindly told they work on commission which isn't my problem then he told us to leave. Funniest thing I've ever seen... A thirtyish year old man having a pint sized temper tantrum. This ""BS"" aside the coffee shop is great for breakfast, it's expensive but I'm yet to find anything in Vegas that isn't. We did a trip to Gilley's to have drinks and a bite the service was poor and the food was actually not good at all. I don't recommend a trip to Gilley's if your looking to do a family meal. More a drunken party with the boys in the bar rather than the restaurant.

The value is hard to beat, which is why I have stayed here a handful of times over the past decade, which comprises a significant number of the 2-3 trips to Vegas I average per year.

With that said, some aspects of TI have been on the decline since it was sold off by MGM-Mirage. First, the dinning and nightlife options have been significantly downgraded. TI seems to be in transition from a place which catered to a young crowd to a primarily budget oriented crowd. 

For example, TI used to offer a decent nightclub (Tangerine), a great sushi restaurant (Social House), and a great lunch option (Canter's Deli). None of those options were replaced by a near equivalent when they departed. Senior Frog's is the closest thing to a nightclub, and there is no restaurant of note.  Also, I did notice that the beds were a bit overly warn in on this past trip. But these are things I can live with in light of the competitive rates.

Here's why I had to reduce the review from 3 stars to 2:

Our party had a problem with the Cabana host. We were told that the cost for a Cabana was $145, then later billed $300 exclusive of food, beverages, or extras. The servers were relatively unapologetic for the miscommunication and nobody from TI would take any responsibility for THEIR mistake. The issue was never resolved fully resolved, though a cabana host ultimately reduced the price to $275, which seemed arbitrary. Nonetheless, our party was forced to pay a price that it did not agree to, which was nearly double what we were quoted - as witnessed by several of us. 

Further, the server treated us like degenerates and would not allow us to leave the pool area until she counted out our payment, which of course was sufficient. This added insult to injury. Nobody threatened to not to pay, or to only pay $145. We just sucked it up and paid an amount we did not agree to. This all made for an embarrassing and aggravating experience, and I regretted ever setting foot at the TI pool. 

There is plenty of competition on the strip for cabana's. $145 sounded like a reasonable price for a cabana at TI, when comparing it's small, dumpy pool to competitors who charge double or more. If we were at the Venetian pool or EBC, this would be recognized as an obvious error. Not at TI, however. 

Overall, I do not think I would return as a guest at TI because of how my party was treated at the pool. Our food and drink bill was well over $400 before tip, so I am uncertain why our servers felt it was imperative to pull a bait and switch on the cabana price. TI was 100% responsible for the confusion, and they should have acted accordingly. Instead of elevating the issue to a manager, it was simply along the lines of ""sorry, this is what you have to pay."" 

Luckily, there are always plenty of options in Vegas and I will be happy to take my business somewhere else.",9,1,0

Also, on the tail of that, perhaps have a policy so that if housekeeping discovers a room that their system says should be empty (because the check-in\/out person didn't follow the above-mentioned capitalized words) that instead of taking the items to lost and found, that security and staff investigate as to why the room is obviously occupied by people who are going to be returning as evidenced by the clothes, electronics, and toiletries.

-Free wifi!
-Located right on the strip.
-Nice, soft duvet, an array of different-sized pillows

The bad:
-Our room smells pretty smoky, but maybe that's something hard to avoid since it seems like everyone smokes in Vegas.
-The shower is terrible. Low-pressure showerhead that leaves me feeling icky...yuck!
-There is a $25\/day surcharge on top of the room fees that they only tell you when you check in. Sneaky! (Okay, the hubs just said that they mentioned the surcharge on our booking page, but it was in small print all the way down the page on Expedia. I maintain that this is super sneaky.)
-You're not allowed to bring your own water or food to the pool, which sucks as Vegas is so hot and dry it takes no time at all to start getting thirsty. They do this in the hope that guests will buy more of their overpriced drinks, which is really annoying.
-The hubs thinks that the AC in the back of the hotel is noisy and can be heard from our room, but he is super sensitive when it comes to noises like these, whereas I am able to tune it out, so this only affects whiny people like him...

Since neither of us had been to Vegas we decided to go all out by getting a suite at TI. 1st night toilet over flowed with raw sewage that ran from the toilet across the ladies bathroom, through the wall and soaked the carpet in the closet of the men's bathroom creating a pungeant mildew odor. Housekeeping was called. She brought a spray bottle of something pink and proceeded to wipe what came from the toilet with towels we had been given to bathe with! No she didn't replace them. No we weren't offered another room. No the cleaner didn't have bleach, ammonia or anything resembling a product to kill germs, diseases and God only knows what else! Ecoli? Staph? or i dont know Hepatitis perhaps? I don't live in a 3rd world country! I live in this one where people are suppose to have some common dam sense! Then the actual day of our anniv it was warm so I cut on the a\/c. Long story short it didn't work and needed the entire motor replaced. So the day of our anniv instead of the romantic time planned (and paid for) there were maintenance men running in and out our door replacing the motor to the A\C unit. Our 10th anniv was completely ruined at that point between the noise and smell. Yet again we weren't offered to move or anything else for all these problems. At checkout we asked if maybe some of the charges could be refunded on those nights. We were told all they could do was they could knock off the $20\/night resort fee (total of $80) which was rather insulting. We spent over $1000 plus room service, had our weekend ruined and had the worst stay at a hotel I have ever had in my life! I travel a good bit been to 27 states and this has never once happened! Bad service and things break yes but they compensated in some way for the problem. Would never recommend this place to anyone! Truth is we had planned to stay a week but after all of that, we left and got another suite at a much nicer, less expensive resort that actually seemed to care they had people staying with them and not just another dollar sign. TI wasn't at capacity and wouldn't have cost a dime to move us to a new room. Actions spoke loud and clear that TI did NOT care we had problems during our stay due to no fault of our own.

The casino is ""okay"". It was a little dark but plenty of slot machines, $10 min tables, etc. 

There is a tram that you can hop on that takes you to The Mirage which we actually used quite a bit. It is free. 

I think TI is located in a good spot on the Strip.... fairly central. Across from Venetian and next to Mirage and Cesars. 

One IMPORTANT thing I must point in regard to getting around The Strip in general is that each Casino has a designated Uber\/Lift pick-up spots.

When we first walked in, the perfume-y smell was a little overwhelming but my sensitive nose was able to get over it pretty quickly.  The line moved pretty swiftly and we were in our room less than 20 minutes after stepping into the hotel.
The room had 2 king size beds with a decent sized bathroom.  It was clean and the beds were super comfy!!  Nothing to really write home about.  But, once again, for the price we paid over Memorial Day weekend, I think we got a killer deal.

Pool Review: The pool was nice, on the smaller side but nice. I liked how they had a bench running along side the pool, so you were able to sit.

We tried their dinner buffet because of the 2 for 1 special and boy oh boy, BAD CHOICE.  The selections were so few and maybe 2 out of 6 dishes were good.  The only up side about the buffet is that the chefs can make you vietnamese PHO, and personalize your pasta to your liking.  

We had to find activities outside this hotel.  However, we did get a free firework show from our hotel window because they would perform their pirate show around 7pm.

There was also a total mix up with my room , 

They were suppose to give me a refund because I had an emergency but did not process correctly and kept blaming my bank , as a banker I know that this was not true the staff did not know what they were doing the managers were clueless and everyone kept giving me different information clearly they were not trained properly and do not understand their own policies. They messed up me reservation and almost left me with no room and when I let the manager know they would be leaving me with nowhere to sleep they did not care one of the managers being Justin.

I came into the hotel not expecting a whole lot but got a whole lot.  I'll break it down into sections:

Staff - The staff were very friendly and helpful from the check-in guy who upsold us to a suite for $50 more a night (which was well worth it, more on that later) to the room service guy who brought us our dinner one night and our free champagne the next night).
  
Accomodations - We upgraded to a suite which had two bathrooms (one with an uber-deep jacuzzi tub and one with an awesome shower) which was well worth the extra $50 a night.  The bed and linens were amazing.  When checking in, ask for a strip view and clarify you want a view on the pool side and not the Sirens side.  We also had family staying in a non-suite which we visted and had the same great beds and linens and a very nice bathroom with a deep tub.

Casino - Pretty standard fare.  Good amounts of slots and table games.  $5 blackjack during non-prime times, $10-15 minimum during peak hours.

Food - Loved the buffet and room service from The Coffee Shop was great (try the malted milk cake...delicious and only $7).  The deli\/sandwich place was overpriced and under-delivered.

Extras - The Starbucks was easily accessible.  The tram to the Mirage was great, although it's only a short walk.  The Sirens show was embarassingly bad.  Not ""this is so bad you have to see it"" bad, but just ""I kind of wish I had a sharp object to stab in my eyes and ears"" bad.  Zero entertainment value to it....it's too risque for kids but then not risque enough for the 20-30ish crowd they're trying to attract.  Not sure it really has anything to offer to anyone.  Also, Mystere is performed here...a good all-around show that's not heavy on the wallet.

Just from the looks of it, it certainly wasn't the Caesar's Palace or Bellagio's but I enjoyed it. The room was surprisingly clean and modern, we didn't do much hanging around in the lobby area but the restaurants & casinos were plentiful. The bed was so comfortable, I slept like a baby! (Also may have to do with the fact that we were out all night!) 

The service is obviously not what I was looking for in a Vegas hotel, so I wasn't disappointed or impressed. The check-in process was like a cattle call, nothing personal and not friendly. 

The location was probably the main thing, right on the strip and close to everything! I loved it and my heels appreciated that too! 

As far as the Sirens of TI, I had the worst luck. I went when they were doing construction, so everything was torn apart and nothing was going on. You couldn't even tell what was supposed to even be there - it was that bare. I'm upset, but hopefully I'll get another chance to watch it! 

The price - as everyone knows - isn't as ridiculous as some of the neighboring hotels. If you're looking for quality customer service with a top notch room, maybe pay the extra $100 to stay elsewhere, but if you (like most of us) only need a room with a bed to stay in that's in a great location, save the $100 for the craps table and stay here!",0,0,0

One of the negative things about the hotel was the Front Desk staff.  I did have two women that were nice, but for the most part, whenever I called and ever checking in the women was very rude and not informative at all.  Our deal included a pool cabana, Cirque tickets, and complimentary champagne and strawberries and she gave us no information on what or when to claim these items.  Also, on GroupOn, it said there were over 500 hundred vouchers sold and none of the staff at the front desk seemed to know anything about the deal.  I work in a office where we use the vouchers often and we are trained to know what to do when a client comes in with one.

On the plus side, the staff at the box office for Mystere, which was a very impressive Cirque show and would highly recommend it, was wonderful.  He instantly new were had a GroupOn voucher and was getting to know us and being extremely helpful.  And I can't say enough good things about the staff at the pool.  Our cabana supervisor, Scottie, was the most personable guy we met in Vegas.  He checked up on us, made sure all our goodies were stocked constantly and got to know us as well.  He really seemed to be interested in our plans and us which made the pool experience so much more natural and comfortable.  Also our first server of the day, Erin, was so awesome and helpful!  I loved the pool and the DJ.  He played such a variety of music and was taking requests and shout outs.  I would also recommend eating at Kahunaville, an American\/Hawaiian fusion restaurant, or Gilley's, a country saloon that serves BBQ and has a great bar!  We ate breakfast and lunch at Kahunaville one day because it was delicious.  Our room was a tower suite with a great view of TI's Sirens Show and the strip!  The most comfortable beds we have ever slept in by far!  Very large and great bathrooms.

The new Sirens Show is different.  Very much more Vegasy...there are signs warning parents that it's not for kids.  And it's Vegas...why are you bringing your kids anyways??

I would definitely stay at Treasure Island again!  Loved being on the strip and our experience.",1,0,0

Arrival\/Check-In: Easy to access the hotel from Las Vegas Blvd. and Spring Mountain. Only downside was the horribly designed parking structure and the long walk to the check in counter. There was complimentary early check-in that day (10am!) which was cool! Check in took about 15 minutes around 2:30pm.

Price: Got a great deal here for about $180 for 2 nights on Vegas.com (plus 2 free buffets). Added on was a $25\/night resort fee and subtracted was a $15 Vegas.com discount code, bringing my 2-night total to a very reasonable $215.

The $25\/night resort fee is high, even for Vegas, but I found it to be bearable. Includes wi-fi, fitness center access, newspaper, printing\/calling\/faxes, 2-for-1 on cocktails and buffet (M-F only), and $20 for a future visit.

Location: Great for what my girlfriend and I had planned: A Friday night trip to Surrender and touring around the north end of the strip. There is a free tram to the Mirage and a crosswalks right by the hotel, making the north end of the strip entirely walkable. Although the hotel lacks a major worthwhile attraction aside from Cirque du Soleil's Mystere show, its proximity to places like Wynn\/Encore's clubs or Venetian's shops makes up for it - all at a fraction of the cost.

Hotel: Well laid out. Easy and to find your way around and quick elevators up to your room (they're divided up, so my 26th floor room elevator was for floors 25-30, plus the spa and ballroom floors). The hotel itself is not flashy like the ones surrounding it, but it's still very nice and made me feel comfortable. 

Room: I loved the room! Clean, luxurious, and very functional. The beds were amazing and left me ready and energized the next day following 2 long nights out. Bonuses included was a small refrigerator (no minibar crap inside), safe, a lot of counter space, and an ironing board\/iron. The bathroom was contemporary and luxurious as well, featuring a makeup mirror, a well-built bath tub, and toiletries from their in-house spa.

Gambling: Came up $25 on 5cent slots! hahaha

Food: Ate at the TI buffet. Middle of the road, but hey, with a free pass or the included 2-for-1 it's worth a quick meal. Did not get a chance to check out the other places. My girlfriend ordered a drink from the Starbucks inside the hotel - skip this one and try the one on the strip instead.

Amenities: Did not take advantage of these aside from the wi-fi, unfortunately. If I had more time I would have liked to check out the fitness center. The Sirens of TI did not interest me (The Yelp gods warned me it was not worth my time).

Check out: Fast and easy via TV. Late check out was granted to me so that was cool.

Overall: I had a wonderful time at TI. I got a tremendous deal but my stay was so good that I would not hesitate to stay here again even if I had to pay a little more. The comfortable rooms were just what I was looking for and its location on the strip should make for quite an appeal to those who want to go out and have someplace nice to come back to. 

I will be coming back here in the future, hopefully to catch Mystere. My trip to TI was definitely one to be treasured. Great value, great rooms, great location, and a very pleasant stay. 4\/5.",5,0,1

John is rude and have no empathy. We booked TWO bedrooms  with Double\/Twins and paid everything up front except resort fees. My sister-in-law flew in from different city and checked in early. She requested a roller bed and she had to 50 bucks per night, which is reasonable.

When I checked in, front desk - Kyle. He said we booked a king size bed. I showed him the resevartion and it is twins. He told me they didn't have any room available. I asked what does it mean? Then he said If we want to upgrade to twins bedroom, we have to pay extra 50 dollars each night. So I said NO, this is no right! I told him my  sister in law didn't pay for that why do I need to? I asked him to show me the upgrade document that she signed. At first, he said okay and printed it but he didn't show us. Then, we talked to the manager - JOHN BISHOP, who is very rude person and I don't know how could he be the manager in the front desk. No manners at all. He told us that my sis-in-law was offered for an upgrade without any charge for the roller bed, which is bullshit!",6,0,0

1.  Big room.  We had our kids sleep on the large couch since there was only 1 king bed.  They loved it. 
2.  2 large bathrooms!  The jacuzzi tub is the bomb...went in it 2 times a day.
3. The cost for this suite was very reasonable for the holiday.
4.  The customer service is very helpful when you call in to inquire about reservations. I advise you to call instead of booking online since the reps will give you the best rate at that time.
5.  Mystere is awesome and located inside the hotel.Call to get tickets for best rate.
6. CVS is located downstairs so you can load up on water and snacks and bring to the room

Cons:
1.  We had no clock or coffee maker in our suite. We did a refrigerator at least.
2.  The room service prices are extremely high for average food. Plus a $7 per room fee is tacked on.  We would go downstairs and eat at the coffee shop or other restaurants.
3.  The pool is small.  I was really bummed because the kids were really looking forward to go to the pool but it was packed like sardine with adults drinking alcohol and partying. We were able to get some time between 9am-11am but after that its packed.  I wish they had 2 separate pools.  There are cabanas and couch seats that range from $75-$300.  Those were pretty much empty. At other hotels I have stayed at, they would usually offer that for free if on a slow day as long as we ordered food and drinks.  That would have been a nice perk to offer the guests at TI and make it more memorable but they didn't budge.
4.  Barely watched TV but when I did it had a slow response",0,0,0

I got great rates here from Southwest Vacation (I am not affiliated with them in any way) and the staff here is friendly enough to upgrade me to bigger suite with my choice of view. I like both sides of the building, I don't think there is a ""bad"" view here because of the way this building is structured.

There isn't a lot of things to do in this hotel. Gift shop, casino, some restaurants, and the outside free entertainment is all great. Also a small club, not crowded at all, free with your stay, of course. Some small indoor shows, also, depending on days. 1 star less because of the lack of things to see here. 

The rooms are large and clean! There are so many other resorts in the Strip that is much more expensive and yet very small. This is economical, clean, doesn't smell bad, great looking, and is large!! The level of noise is very minimal, and the walls between rooms isn't paper thin. 

One thing i really love (Idk if ALL Vegas hotels has it) is the blackout curtains! Swear to blob I can't see or hear a thing with those blinds closed. I'd swore it was 2 am no matter what time of the day it actually is! I love it, gives me the needed sleep after a loooooong night. Haha.

I remember they had a free pirate ship show at night, which later morphed into the Sirens show.  Inside the casino there are lots of casual places to eat and drink, and it just seems like a fun and laid back atmosphere.  

GAMING
The Blackjack here is great - mostly $10 tables, but shoe games and continuous shufflers pay 3:2 on blackjacks compared to that horrendous 6:5 at most newer and more glamorous\/modern places.  Single deck pays 6:5.  There's just one Ultimate Holdem table at $10.  A few Pai Gow Poker tables too.

LOCATION
Easy walk to Fashion Show Mall for non-gamblers and Wynn for the high rollers.

Our tower suite was clean, comfortable and nicely decorated. Plenty of closet space and two gorgeous bathrooms, with lots of seating area for groups to hang out and relax. 

The Chapel at TI did an amazing job and we felt like the only wedding of the day (they had eight). Dinner in the private room at Phil's Steakhouse was amazing and my guests spent the rest of the weekend going on about how great the food and drinks were. Mystere was pretty and family friendly but also a bit incomprehensible...no plot, more like a weird and well costumed circus. 

Daytime room service people were amazingly friendly and helpful. Nighttime room service was not as good and the server insisted on leaving my room with my credit card in his hand!!! Two days later I got a spoof email from ""my bank.""

I definitely suggest that if you want to sit by the pool for a day in Vegas, a cabana is the way to go!",1,0,1

We had such an amazing room with such an amazing view.

They also have a really good buffet that we ate at a couple of times. The people who work there are all really helpful and we only waited like 5 minutes to check in.

PROS: The room: LARGE ROOM, living room, huge super comfy bed, table with chairs, desk, flat-screen TV, double-door entry, large window, two bathrooms (his and hers). The hotel: Nice hotel in a good location on the strip. Plenty of restaurants, bars, and even a 24 hour Starbucks. 

CONS: The room: The TV was fairly small with not so great speakers. The hotel: Nice hotel, but don't expect a super awesome ""Pirate Theme""; some parts of the casino have a Pirate vibe to it, but not as extravagant as you would hope for. Although there are quite a few bars, this is one of the only major resorts on the strip with no night-club. If clubbing is your thing, expect to walk a little ways to another resort for that club experience. Upon check-in, definitely take advantage of the complimentary valet parking. If you self-park, you will have to walk a very long way through the casino to get to the front-desk.

However, I always forget about the resort fees (about $30 a night) so I guess it kind of evens out, haha.

Nonetheless, I really did enjoy my stay here. The rooms were very nice.. nicely renovated, high ceilings, pretty overall. We stayed at the highest floor, which I assume is the VIP floor.. so in order to access it through the elevator you have to insert your room key in a designated slot in the elevator; it was weird but I guess its necessary. We also had a veiw of the Strip, which was pretty cool as well.

In addition to the room, I liked the parking situation (easy access to the garage), security at the elevators to the guest rooms (making sure guests are safe), and also all the cool deals that come with the room (most of which are for their establishments in the resort). It's also good that it's in the middle of the strip, so it's walking distance to all the cool spots on the Strip.

Views, needless to say, were terrific.  The room was plenty big enough, with a very nice bathroom.  Everything was clean (kudos to the Housekeeping staff).  We were also pleased with how quiet it was upstairs.  No noisy neighbors, or kids running up and down the hallways.  Very nice!

Downstairs seemed pretty chaotic.  No separation between the casino, restaurants, and aisles to the lobby and elevators.  Personally, I prefer for the casino to be somewhat separated from the common areas, so that you don't have so many people walking by you while you're trying to concentrate on your games.  

This is definitely a family friendly resort, so if you're looking for something a bit more ""adult"", this might not be the best choice.  

The restaurants on site were mostly decent.  We enjoyed one breakfast at the Coffee Shop, and another at the Buffet.  Both were good, and the staff in both places were very friendly and helpful.  We had a Happy Hour Drink and snack at Phil's Steakhouse.  Terrific!  Senor Frogs is standard tourist fare and ambience.  Gilley's - well that was just a big disappointment. Several times, we just parked ourselves in the Breeze Bar - enjoyed our adult beverages, and had a blast ""people watching"".  Great way to relax and recharge!

We found it easy to walk from TI down to Caesar's, Bellagio, and Paris.  The Mirage is on one side of TI, and the Fashion Show Mall is on the other.  So, there are many things to go see and experience within a very reasonable distance.  For this, we give TI's location very high marks.  

All in all, we had a great time.  We're empty nesters, so maybe we'd go somewhere less family oriented next time.  But we were treated well, had a very comfortable and clean room, and we never went hungry (or thirsty!).  Solid value at TI.",3,2,2

I went straight down to the  front desk where manager Fabiola was completely rude and told me all she can do is move me rooms and there would only be a 20$ refund. I spoke to her and tried to reason with her. No luck. They ended up moving me just right across the hall which I didn't think was safe. 

After returning home my girlfriend ended up having to go the doctors because she was so bit up on her back by the bed bugs.

For some reason, I'm comp'ed here.  I think they have me confused for someone else, but I do play at the $10 tables and run a Martingale - can bet up to $80.  So the room is free and the food\/drinks are all inclusive.  Can't beat that.

When we checked in at 10:30 PM, my wife asked for a high level.  We got put onto floor 30 with a view of the Strip.  That was excellent and unexpected with such a late check in.

There's a Gilley's and a Kahunaville that we went to.  The Gilley's was a lot of fun: the Stephanie Eason band was playing and they were doing a pretty excellent set of Miranda Lambert, so it was easy to get into.

Then, at the Craps table, I ran into a unique experience.  I was making regular bets of come and then odds.  Then I am leaving the odds working for the come out roll.  Anyhow, I'm excited (high fives and such) about winning the last point (a 6) and I forgot the odds bet on the 6, much less having it work.  So the come out roll is... a 6.  I should have been a winner if I kept doing what I was doing.  But then, a twilight zone moment occurs and the dealer to my left kind of leans forward, about to pay me off but there's no bet, when he says, ""well, he MEANT to bet it.  Hold up!  The player over here has been making the same bet all afternoon and he would have bet the six and had the odds working.""  There's a brief discussion, not too long and boom - here comes $34 my way, for THE BET I WOULD HAVE MADE.  

I have never been paid for a bet I never made before.  But I tip the dealers in craps which is rare.  (how come nobody does - these guys have special brains being able to keep track of 10 different peoples' bets at once).  Anyhow, I tip even more afterwards, about another $15.  The boxman, who has a sense of humor, says ""so you got your little quid-pro-quo going again I see, Charlie"" and we keep rolling winners.  Fun group - like rolling with your buddies.

Last story, I sent in my sports book tickets in the mail.  A day later, the local post office sends back a shred of the envelope with a message ""sorry, your mail was damaged"".  Well, I thought the mail was swiped.  I google on line for advice and one person says, ""well if you know the hotel exec, you might have a 0.1% chance of getting paid.   In a desperate moment, I call the Treasure Island accounting department anyway and Dena, the best employee of all time, takes the run down from me, puts a stop payment on the mailed in tickets so that no one will cash them and makes the arrangements to meet with her boss to pay off based on an electronic scanned copy of the winning tickets!  Turns out this is not needed; a day later, she calls me back saying the tickets arrived, flopping out of a now open envelope, but intact just the same.  Expect the check in 3-5 days.  I wish I could have tipped her, for the diligence, follow-up.",0,0,0

A lot of the reviews that give TI low marks are based on a critique of the free street viewable Pirate show which is not really something that is important to me when selecting or reviewing a hotel (unless of course you count the uber-fabulous Bellogio Water Show and then maybe it is worth considering as an added value.)
Room rates fluctuate greatly in Vegas and I wanted to stay at Planet Holly wood but the rate of 297.00 for Friday night was a little ridiculous since I had paid as low as 89.00 a night before there.  So I tried TI.  I am glad I did.  It is a great location.  The newly refurbished compact room on the 19th floor was clean and well appointed.  The one experience I had on the phone with the front desk was of high quality.
So if you are looking for a reasonable, well located, clean place to stay.  TI fits the bill.
The age seems a lot younger here than Planet Hollywood which can be good or bad depending on what you are looking for.  I found the median age to be around 26 at the pool which had a kind of better landscaped frat-house vibe.  Much smaller than the pool area at PH, but kind of more interesting for people watching since you must stay close to others because of the size..  I can see the pool area getting kind of rowdy, but that isn't necessarily bad.. It's all about what you are looking for.

The room was nice, the towels were minimal, the people that really drive the hotel, the cleaning crew were awesome and made our stay a great one despite that experience.
This resort fee thing that's popular in Vegas..to use the gym, and internet..well mixed feelings there, however the internet was extremely fast and easy to set up.

This hotel is in the middle of the strip and a short walk from pretty much everywhere so we had a good few days here without the need of using our car.   

But I agree with a lot of reviewers on here, the wait staff at the desk it's a sign of management not coaching the staff, not encouraging them to go above and beyond, good things come to people that do their best at their jobs.  They may not think of it as a career option perhaps, but regardless, put in your best effort, you never know who will be on the other side of that counter, imagine ""I remember you, you were so nice to me and my wife and still had a smile even after checking what seems like thousands of people"", at an interview where you are sweating bullets for a job you really want.

TI isn't the worst place to stay but far from the best of moderately priced resort casinos on the Strip.

First, registration is a mob scene with too few guest services windows and it's one of the smokiest hotels I've stayed at 

(And I've stayed at at least 10 different properties over the years, usually on business). 

Despite the griping from Yelpers, the rooms aren't that dated and housekeeping does a *superior job cleaning the rooms and common areas. 

The pool is always populated but the DJ spins lousy music with a heavy rotation of Maroon 5.

The Coffee Shop has decent breakfast selections and on the other side of the restaurant is Pho that serves its namesake and okay Americanized Cantonese dishes. 

In addition to the elevators taking you around the edges of the casino (if I were playing I'd be annoyed) the doors on the rooms don't have gas hinges so insensitive (or drunk) guests slam doors at all hours of the day and night.

I didn't sleep well the two nights I was there. 

You'll pay the now-common ""resort fee"" ($29) per night to get wifi and use of the pool and gym. 

Actually, you'll pay regardless so avail yourself.

Not the best but far from the worst and their housekeeping staff gets a big gold star.

On this excursion all the important boxes were marked. First, we arrived too early to check in so we were instructed to leave our bags with the bell hop outside. We did, and he attended to us nicely even though the day was approaching SWELTERING status.

So, off we went in search of the pool. Our company rented cabana # 15 and we were immediately introduced to our server Christine\/Christina. This girl was LEGIT. She was working her tail off making sure all of us had what was required. This started at noon all the way to about 4:30. Seriously, I had to tell her how AWESOME she was.

After our escapades at the pool with frolicking adults and a full blown DJ, I decided a small nap was in order prior to our dinner across the street. When I called the bell hop for my bag I expected it to take a nice block of time since I was on the 32nd floor. INCORRECT-a-mundo. It seemed like the bag and the bellman were transported Star Trek style. Yes, I had a plethora of alcohol but I was not THAT tipsy. The bellman was polite & courteous. 

Okay, now I was able to investigate the King Size bed. The sheets and the mattress were divine. Yes, the pillows were a bit mushy but everything else was above the bar. The bathroom was HUGE and plenty of items were provided for my use as well as some pilfering. SSHHH!!

Price is decent for what you get. The only problem is the price of wi-fi. 15 bucks per night is a rip. Not everyone is using an expense acct for business use.",1,1,1

As far as location on the strip, it's a little bit north of center.

They had really comfortable firm beds, clean quiet rooms, and the best rates during any season.  They were pretty much the best bang for the buck on the strip.

Since the change of hands, TI has really transformed into something else. =( My man and I decided on a last minute (booked the hotel on Monday and arrived that very Friday) trip out to Vegas before both our schedules got too hectic. As a result, we had to book a hotel with rates that weren't completely ridiculous at that point.

Upon our arrival, there were some complications with the room we had booked (king bed, non-smoking) -- they didn't have one for us! =(  So they decided to give us an ""upgrade"" for a room with two queen beds (even though we only needed one bed) with a view of the strip.  However, the lady at the front desk did tell us that if we were not fully happy with our room that night, we could switch to a king bed\/non-smoking (what we had originally booked) the next day. The reason for this was that they were overbooked so a king bed\/non-smoking would only be made available during check-in time the following day.

We were hoping to be satisfied with the room they gave us so that we wouldn't have to go through the trouble of switching rooms the next day. Unfortunately, the room we got for the first night was a disappointment:

1) It was a handicapped smoking room, so even though it was slightly more spacious in some areas, such as bathroom square footage, there was a lot of compromise as well.  There was only one sink and the vanity space was only about a foot on each side of the sink as compared to the typical vanity that would span from wall to wall.

2) They only provided 3-4 towels TOTAL in the bathroom.

3) There was no tub, nor was there a stall for the shower.  Since the room was designed for the handicapped, the floor was continuous into the shower so it was easy for water to get all over the place. 

4) The TV in the room had issues -- we were not able to change the channels\/volume or turn it off, so we ended up having to call maintenance to turn it off for us because it was already on when we got to the room.

5) The clock wasn't working at all, and we ended up using our cell phones to set our alarms.

*************and last but definitely NOT least...************************

I discovered that I had bed bug bites the next day!  AHH!! I only had a couple bites show up the next day so I didn't really think much of it.  But then both of us developed more the following day and they lasted about a week.  (We both have experienced bed bug bites from a previous trip to Jamaica so we are familiar with identifying them).

We ended up switching rooms the next day, but since I already got the bites by then, we were sure that there were bed bugs in the handicapped room. Our new room was slightly better in terms of amenities, but the bed had two sunken areas on each side (even obvious with the comforter on it!) -- the sign of a very old mattress. And because more bed bug bites appeared later (I believe I counted 14 bites), we are not certain whether they were a delayed response from the handicapped room or if the new room was infested by bed bugs as well.

With all these issues with our stay -- ESPECIALLY THE BED BUGS -- we don't plan on staying at TI again in the future.  We've been loyal to TI for a long time from our great past experiences, but that has come to an end. I have never had bed bug problems at any other Vegas hotel before this trip and have been thoroughly dissatisfied with this stay. So sad. We wish we could still love you TI. =(",11,1,1

Again *sigh* yelp needs 1\/2 stars!  I would have given 3.5, but rounded up.  The Buffet is very good and I would say a hidden gem.  The café is good as well.  

Our room... we stayed in a mini upgrade that had two bathrooms!  Since we have two teenagers this was awesome!  LOVED the bathrooms. One for them and one for us.  One side has a full size closet, mini fridge, safe, and a Jacuzzi tub.  The other side has a full size closet, and huge shower that you can sit in.  The room itself was nice, but for the size of the room the TV could have been larger. 

My husband and I had a great night out at Senior Frogs.  We sat at the bar, drank, and people watched all night.  

It is a relatively kid friendly hotel if you've got teens.  My daughter loved the oxygen bar.  She got to sit on the outside of the nightclub basically and did her own people (drunks) watching one night.  Yes, thought she was all grown up.  Had a great time.   There are also shops for them to cruise, a good pizza place, and it's right across the street from a huge indoor mall.  


CONS
We were there for a baseball tournament.  Usually I am a sun junkie, but the weather was a bit off that weekend with some thunder storms that even shut the pool down due to lightening.  We have a pool at home and I LOVE laying out... add a cabana and someone who brings me drinks and I'm in heaven.  Although, we were so busy I didn't get to use the pool once that weekend.  That doesn't mean I didn't go down to check it out.  The music was a bit ""off"" and for the size of the hotel I found the pool to be small and kinda boring in design\/nature.   

Where my ""sucks"" portion really starts... is the Phil's Italian Steak House.  I called down for reservations.  Asked for party of four at 7:45pm.  She said couldn't take us until 8pm.  Hey, ok, they're busy.  NOPE.  Place was pretty much empty.  So let me get this right... if I had said no to the 15 minute time difference you would have been okay with losing out on the sale?  Food was simply ""OK"".  Nothing spectacular at all.  For a meal that was over $450..... take your money to Ruth Chris, Morton's, etc.  The quality here was NOT the same in comparison by far.  Was very disappointed.  I understand, that hotel restaurants can be pricey, but for a steak house I would at least expect great quality for the pricing.  Again, take your money down the road to another place if you're wanting steak.  Will come back again, but will not eat at the Steak House.

Two more somewhat sucky portions.  We drove from San Diego.  Pulled up to the front entrance about 1:30am.  There was one car in the valet lane so I thought he was unloading and pulled behind.  No, he was loading up to leave.  Now, I could see there was a valet guy further ahead and he was leaning on something making no motions to us what so ever.  Mind you... it's 1:30am on a Thursday (well technically now Friday), so nobody here.  Most valet I've encountered hop on over to you, flag or wave you over closer, etc.  Nope, not this guy.  Then, when I did go around the car and pulled up further he asked me our last name and was giving me my ticket... nothing else.  Not ""are you checking in"" ""let me get you a bell hop"", nothing.  We had to state we were checking in and ask for a bell hop.  Seriously, how many families do you have pull up at 1:30am that aren't checking in?  You could tell this was definitely the night crew that had not been upgraded.  I will add that during the days and other nights we pulled in and the other valet guys were good.  But the guy on a slow Thurs late night... not so hot. 

Checking in.  We were literally the only ones at check in at this hour.  Again, definitely the night crew that has not been promoted yet.  While the guy checking us in was very nice... he was soooooo slow and robotic.  I'm used to perky and quick... perky and quick.  Instead of swiping the credit card once and be on our way... he swiped it once for each night.  Huh?  So, nice enough guy, but not up on his speed and perkiness yet.  Night crew.

We will definitely go back though.  We will simply avoid the Steak House for sure.",0,0,0

The on site Pizza Parlor was surprisingly good and even gluten free pizza available. 
   CON'S:  The  dealers on the craps table except for Billy, were just nasty.  They enjoyed the failures of anyone playing.  Laughing at one point when things were going poor.  The bar tender at the center bar had an attitude that since he has been there for 15 years, he was the s**t.  Don't bother asking him a question, he's too good to answer correctly.

At Check-in, the way the associate carefully and with two-hands returned important things like Drivers License, Credit Card, was so specific and intentional, I liked it.

My room was comfy, clean and relatively spacious; the King bed gave me a good sleep. The in-room internet worked generally very well. I upgraded to the Strip View for a few bucks more to insure a higher floor, and that's recommended if you're at all concerned about possible noise.

OKAY, obviously nothing like the Venetian, Wynn or Palazzo BUT for the location, price and what you get: TOTALLY WORTH IT.

The only reason why it's not 5 stars is because the pool is small!

We must have gotten a newly remodeled room because it looked beautiful! Straight out of Architectural Digest. BIG comfortable, soft bed (seriously it could have comfortably fit 3 people), flat screen tv and a lounge area\/seating. The bathroom was pretty sweet too. I was impressed.

The casino is pretty small. Lots of slot machines, not even tables, I think. But I don't really gamble so it's not that big of a deal to me.

There are some great looking restaurants that I have yet to try but they all seem really hip and swanky. Treasure Island also has the only pho restaurant I know of on the strip. It's not very good but hey, some people might dig it.

The pool area is soo small. Lounge chairs all crammed together everywhere! The pool was filled with sweaty bodies with their drinks, spilling them, kids swimming, adults swimming in DENIM SHORTS - EW!

The pool was just gross but it was so hot!!! We had 2 medium pina coladas ar $17 EACH!! Hey, you get a free cup too.

I agree with Matthew E.: the best thing about TI was location if you like to go clubbing. It's right across from Venetian for TAO and the Wynn for TRYST. Also, right next to the Forums shopping (or window shopping) and Fashion Show Mall.

Not going to lie...but the last time I stayed at this hotel was probably in like 1992...and I remember it being pirate themed.

I guess these days Treasure Island (or apparently TI as they liked to be called) is steering clear or swash buckling pirates and moving into swanky siren territory. I, on the other hand, want more people dressed up with peg legs and hooks for hands.

The hotel rooms are smaller than say Venetian or Bellagio, but decorated pretty nicely. If you've stayed at the Mirage it pretty much has the same exact feel. I do have a problem with the size of the TVs though. They are WAYYY smaller than the other hotels I've stayed at.

As for location...well that's probably why I took off 1 star. Its pretty much on the end of the strip (close to Wynn and Venetian) so walking everywhere will be difficult especially in summer time.

Other than that is was totally worth it.  did not win money on the slots though.",0,0,0

Our room was very nice and had everything we needed. AND was clean! Bed was very comfortable, pillows could use replacing though. 

Pool area is awesome - and anything you'd need you can find in one of the shops inside. I lost my ass like I always do on the slots... but it was fun. 

My only complaint is about the check in process. We arrived AT 3:00pm. The line to check in was very long and slow moving. BUT - the ""express check-in"" area was empty with attendants standing around doing nothing. One of the TI associates began walking around stating ""for $50, you can jump in the express check in line and have NO wait"". So my question is... if I didn't pre-register for express check-in, what would make it so much faster THEN, other than I'm having to pay $50 to get it. when associates are just standing there with nothing to do? Why not open up those lanes during the busy check in times - waive the $50 to provide better customer service?? Also, when we finally got through the long line (almost an hour) and up to our room... our keys had never been activated. But the associate checking us in kept talking about how she couldn't wait to get off work when she was done with us...... so we had to drag all our bags BACK to the lobby (from floor 35, though the busy casino) to get the keys activated. So TI, do the customers a favor.... stop trying to pinch every penny out of our pockets and provide better customer service and better attention to detail.",1,0,0

Front desk: Helpfun, Sweet & Generous with upgrades. 

Casino: The vibe is calm and cosy, limits are usually low, but goes up on weekends. Joe @ the craps table is by far my favorite dealer! 

Pool: First time this year I found it a little dirty, and the pool area should be cleaned twice or more a day when there's a pool party going on. Too many bottles and cups and straws floated around the pool, not very delicious for the people who wants to take a dip in the nicely cold water, away from the 117+ heat in Vegas (June) 

Restaurants: Can't recommend any really because we never really tried, but the Loco Moco burger @ Kahunnaville is pretty good.

When I first heard that we were staying here I was under the impression that it was an older hotel only its not its newly remodeled and conviently RIGHT where we need to be. All of the clubs that we hit up were within walking distance. MIGHT i add one of the best dealers I have ever encountered worked there. Her name was TONI.. from LONG ISLAND...so toni if you ever read this.. I still wanna be married into your family so I could enjoy your wonderful personality for the rest of my life ahhahaha..

I have stayed at TI several times and always had a great experience, until now. We checked in last night about 7:00pm. Upon pulling into Valet we were promptly approached by the valet attendant, although there was not a Bellman in sight to help us with our bags. No biggie, our bags had wheels so made our way to the registration desk. The line wasn't too bad, and we soon checked into our Petite Suit. Because we were celebrating my husbands 40th birthday the lady who checked us in offered a complementary bottle of champagne which we appreciated. She also then offered us baggage assistance but said they were a bit short staffed and it may be a few minutes wait. Again we decided to manage our own bags. We excitedly made our way to our room on the 33rd floor and hurriedly checked out the bathrooms once getting into the room. I was disappointed to find the large jacuzzi tube visibly dirty and while looking around for the light above the tub discover the dirty Kotex pad stuck to the wall of the bathtub! It all went downhill from there...I called the front desk and spoke with Leslie who told me  she would send up housekeeping to investigate. Really? No apology, just an Investigation? Hmmmm, okay then. Anthony from housekeeping came up, took pictures, and said he'd ""let the front desk know"" and that they'd call me. A few minutes later Leslie called the room and offered to switch our room. I agreed (obviously) to which she said she would send up a bellman with the new keys. About 5 minutes later a bell desk attendant arrived with the keys. We dragged our bags to our new room on the 10th floor only to find it was a standard room, not the petite suit I had paid for. I went back down to the front desk. I spoke with a rather timid girl (who's name escapes me), explained the situation from the beginning Kotex pad and all! and when she looked up our room she said ""Sorry, it looks like someone wrote down the wrong room"" (right!) and that she'd fix it. I asked to speak to the manager and after a few moments standing around Joy came over. I AGAIN explained the situation from the beginning. To say she was terribly underwhelmed by my dissatisfaction would be putting it mildly. She offered a very flat apology followed by an offer of a ""comped 2 for 1 buffet"" which come as part of the fun packet you receive at check-in. I declined her offer and tried to explain that I wasn't looking to get anything for free just that I was surprised and disappointed that NO ONE including her seemed the slightest bit bothered by the disgusting circumstances. She actually replied to me ""What do you want from me? I've already apologized to you and offered you a comp. do you want a free room or something?"" I thanked her for her time, asked for my keys and decided to walk away, never to return to TI after this trip. As she began to walk away she rolled her eyes and shook her head. That was it. I asked the shy girl to kindly call Joys supervisor. She walked over to the phone where Joy was standing, which was within earshot from where I was standing. Joy asked her what she was doing, she replied that I'd asked her to call another manager and Joy said ""No. She asked to speak to a manager and she did. That's me and I'm it. Don't call Agnes"". I was blown away! The shy girl comes back to me and says Agnes is very busy and not available. I promptly picked up my handbag walked over to Joy and said to her ""Are you seriously refusing my request to escalate this matter?"" She said no but that her manager was too busy to talk to me. I left with Agnes' phone number and an intention to call her when I arrived back to my new room. We were now late for a dinner reservation so I called from my cell on our way to dinner. I waited on hold for Agnes over 5 minutes only to be hung up on! At dinner my husband and I decided we'd stay the night at TI, but then we were getting the hell outta there! I made alternate reservations at the Venetian for the rest of our trip. When dinner was over I again approached the front desk to inquire about cancelling the reservation for the following 2 nights. That young lady of course wanted to know why, although I could tell there was a novel worth of notes on her screen. She asked me  how she could fix the situation for us and I declined her offer as we were ready to just be done with TI. After a few minutes talking with her, I ended up talking with another manager named Ophelia. After explaining the situation yet again from the beginning she apologized profusely. THATS ALL I WANTED FROM THE BEGINNING! I declined her offers for a comp buffet and late check out, but she asked if she could inconvenience us with one more room switch and said she would do her best to make it worth our wile. She ended up upgrading us to a beautiful suit on the 36th floor (see pics). Thank Ophelia for the room, but more thanks for being as appalled as I was for the service we were shown.

I liked the wide array of restaurants and bars in the hotel and the casino had a pretty good lay out.  I have to say though, it wasn't my favorite casino.  Treasure Island was definitely a little muskier than some of the others we visited on the Strip.

I don't know if it was  because it was mid week but the staff just didn't want to bother with helping us. Nobody was real rude or real friendly.  No bell hop service, the concierge really didn't want to stop reading his paper to answer our questions, no one at the pool to check just grab a towel and walk in. I take it back the bartenders at the pool were nice and the lady working at the Oxygen bar was very nice and friendly.  Besides those three people, the service wasn't great, which is kind of weird since it was so slow there.  
My biggest complaint is there are NO Coffee makers in the room, so once you stumble out of bed, down the stairs, through the casino, wait in line, and then you can buy a Starbucks coffee.  I took away a whole star for just that! 
The beds may have been comfortable at one time, but not so much now.  They need new top mattress covers, they deep dips where other people have been. 
We ate at a couple if places there.  The Kahunaville was OK.  The Coffee shop was expensive and sit at booth if you go there, the table chairs are horrible.  When we sat down the chairs sunk in and the table was just below our shoulders. So, I am thinking a booth would be better unless you are 6'.   We didn't eat at Senor Frogs... but did order a drink there... yuck and expensive.  that's all I have to say about that place.
I wouldn't go back, there are so many other choices and in the same price range.  I didn't think the coffee maker would be such a big deal but it really was :(   
They do have refrigerators in the rooms, stock with your own booze.  A Coors Light bottle cost $7.00 and mixed is $13.00 to $21.00 each.  WOW.  No more drinks free if you are gambling unless you are playing with over $20 and a dollar min each bet.  I didn't see any servers on the floor this was the bar video poker rules.

When we got up to your room the view was good(strip view) but the room was smaller then the rooms at any other hotel I have ever stayed at. The bedding on the bed was the cheapest I've ever seen and made the bedding at a motel 6 desirable. The bedding was a thin sheet( not fitted) over the mattress the two more thin sheets with a thermo or fleece like blanket between them.

As we where cleaning up all our stuff to leave we found the insole to some ones shoe laying under the lounge chair in the room.

Out of all the staff that I had enteractions with the only person who seems happy and friendly was the last at the players club desk who went out of her way to explain how the club works and asked me if I had any questions.

When I reserved my room months ago, I specified that I require a non-smoking room due to my asthma - staying in smoking rooms makes my asthma act up and then I can't breathe. When I checked in, there were no non- smoking rooms available. Ok, that's fine. The front desk then found me a room that is smoking ""optional"" whatever that means.

When I entered my room, I was appalled. The rooms tables, surfaces, dresser and even the sheets has significant dust in them. It was clear the room had not been used or cleaned in a very long time. Running your finger along the surfaces resulted in a dark black layer of dust, so I was very disappointed. When I contacted the frith desk I was told I could not change rooms due to CES.

My family stayed here for a few days in May 2013. On the last night of our stay, I was using the hair dryer they provided which kept turning on and off while it was plugged in. I turned the dryer off, reset the plug and turned it back on. When I turned it back on, there was a large spark that could have started a fire. The outlet on the wall and surrounding wall space was badly burned.  
I called the front desk and they had someone from security and a mechanic come up and check out the dryer and situation. It turns out, after close examination, the hairdryer Treasure Island had a cut in the wire near the plug. It was a serious hazard that created a very scary situation. The mechanic determined the problem, and cleaned up the burn.  I filled out paperwork so they could save the incident on  file and that was it. There was no personal follow up from the hotel management. 

I was put in a dangerous situation because of the hotel and there was no follow up from the hotel management??? Nothing was even said when we checked out and received the bill. I've already e-mailed TI about this issue and never heard from them.
I take many trips to Las Vegas over a year. I don't plan on staying at Treasure Island again with this hair dryer hazard and Treasure Island's poor customer service to not even reach out to me or extend their hospitality.

We went on a couples trip with friends and were all very pleased with the hotel.  I really liked the new modern decor of the rooms with their flat screen tvs and ipod clock radios.  The marble floors in the bathrooms were a nice touch but be careful of those floors-slippery when wet.  We also had double beds and they were just heavenly with their pillowtop matresses, fluffy comforters, and silky soft sheets.  For the price, we were very impressed with the hotel.

We had a chance to hang out at the pool and it was pretty good.  We didn't feel the need to choose a hotel that had a huge impressive pool so it was good for us.  They had waitresses coming around steadily to take our drink and food orders, and that was good enough.  Although it was about 90 degrees out, we stayed in the huge hot tub because it was a comfortable temperature-warm.  The pool was too cold to take a dip in.

I did have one complaint, however.  We were glad our room had double beds because one of the duvets on the bed smelled heavily of mildew!  The minute I sat on it, I could smell it.  As I said, it didn't bother us because we had the other bed to sleep on but just beware.

Treasure Island (or TI as they call it now) is not The Bellagio, or the Wynn, but it is a fantastic value for the money, particularly if you can get it on Priceline. 

PROS
-If you enjoy shopping, there's probably not a better place to be as the Fashion Show Mall is directly next door and accessible by sky bridge, the Forum Shops at Caesar's are adjacent to the neighboring Mirage hotel, and the shops at The Venetian and Palazzo are right across the street (also by sky bridge). 
-The hotel is well-designed and it will take you no more than 5 minutes to get from reception to the guest elevators. There are several bays, and each elevator is designated only to go to a specific set of floors, which prevents overcrowding. If you've ever had to walk through a casino for 20 minutes to get to your room, or waited in a packed elevator bay at rush, you'll really appreciate this.
-Though the hotel does have a resort fee like most outside of the Caesar's Entertainment chain, it is OPTIONAL. If you don't plan on using the WiFi or the fitness center or using the 2 for 1 buffet passes, you can opt out of the $25\/day fee. I wish other hotels that had resort fees would do this.
-Beds are comfy and conducive to a good night's sleep. Or spending all day curled in the fetal position, praying for the pounding in your head to stop. (see next point)
-The bathroom is relatively spacious, and the floor is comfortable. Let's be real. No one talks about bathroom floors in these reviews, but it's not a real trip to Vegas without a massive hangover, and you might be spending a lot of time in here. The bathroom floor is marble, and feels very cool to the touch. The vanity runs the length of the wall and is completely open underneath without cabinet space, so you can pull a pillow in here and lay under the vanity if you need to be close to the toilet but want to get out of the light. The bathtub is actually spacious as well; I've got broad swimmer's shoulders and I had plenty of room.

CONS
-The pool area was closed when I went, even though it was 80+ degrees outside, and it looked rather sad compared to some of the others in Vegas. 
- Food is EXPENSIVE. A large cheese pizza will set you back $29.00 at the hotel pizzeria, and a supreme is $39.50. Kahunaville had specials late at night, but the atmosphere gets a bit obnoxious after about 8pm.
-If you opt out of the resort fee (25\/day) and want to use the WiFi, it costs $19.95 for a rolling 24 hour period. They put a 100 dollar authorization on your card for every day you stay at the hotel when you select an auxiliary service like WiFi, even if you only elect to use it for one day. This is ridiculous. 

TIPS 
-If you're not looking for fine dining, take advantage of the food courts at the Fashion Show Mall next door, or across the street at the Palazzo. The hotel buffet is underwhelming, even when 2 for 1.
-There is a 24-hour Walgreens directly across the street from the hotel via sky bridge at the Palazzo. Go here for all of your sundry needs, snacks and sodas. They also have a full liquor selection so that you can pre-party before dealing with the sticker shock of drink prices at Vegas nightclubs.
-If you like shows, Mystere plays at TI, and Beatles' LOVE (both Cirque du Soleil shows) plays at The Mirage next door. NEVER pay full price for tickets to Vegas shows. Half-Price Tickets has a kiosk right outside of the Fashion Show Mall right next door. 
-Though the food prices can be a bit much in general, the $4.00 to-go tiramisu at the in-house pizzeria is pretty good. Make sure you're eating it over a table or with a napkin on your lap though; it's topped with lots of chocolate shavings, and it won't be pretty if one slips and melts on your clothes. 
-There is a 24 hour Starbucks inside the hotel, but it is not corporate-owned and does not have free WiFi. The Starbucks right outside of the Fashion Show Mall does have free WiFi, though.",13,1,0

Pros:

- as a local, handing 10$ to valet had my car waiting by door when I wanted to leave. Super friendly guys
- easy location to walk to Fashion Show & many nearby dining options
- room was clean, comfy bed 
- Gilley's was a hoot watching drunks ride the bull (avoided a 10$ cover Sat night showing NV driver's license)
- Isla had decent Mexican & was very helpful with my special order, chef came out to ask exactly what I wanted (we were only eating at bar, so kudos to bartender for attention to detail)

SERIOUS CONS:

- tried to rent a cabana @ pool & after waiting 15 minutes were told they were sold out as another group walked up to get one

- the daybed they offered instead was ok & manager (male) who walked us over brought extra towels & water. (he was a GEM, see later)

WE WAITED MORE THAN AN HOUR FOR HAILEY THE COCKTAIL WAITRESS TO COME OVER & she was more interested in promoting her fiancée's family restaurant than in serving us. The manager did check in with us 3x during that hour. 

After getting 2 cocktails for 36$ & tipping 7$ she never looked at us again and my friend requested another waitress who came once (I immediately handed her the 20$ I had been holding in the air trying to get #1's attention) Upon leaving I tipped the manager 20$ for his help. HORRIBLE SERVICE (sans manager @ pool

- Room Service: breakfast was 70$ Lox (served to 2 NYERS) was INEDIBLE & brown & they refused to remove it from bill even though we didn't touch it & tipped 10$ on top of the 5$ room service charge. VERY DISAPPOINTING

- Somehow after being out at pool all day Sat, our key didn't work and my friend had 
to wait at long check in line for 30 mins & then wait another 10 outside room for security to let us in

As a local (of 10 years) and being in the PR business (and both my friend and I waited tables & bartender in past lives) I know what type of service to expect and 
the shortcomings were very disappointing, especially with no offers of compensating us (Except for the male cabana  mgr who did offer us to come back Sun, but we 
were over the pool by then.)

There was an acoustics problem in the room, and you could hear every door slam\/drunken revelry throughout Saturday night. Otherwise, the room itself was clean, well appointed and had an empty fridge & safe.

I made a rsvp for 1 night and decided to make it 2 nights, when I called to add another night to my rsvp I was told that I need to call a 3rd party to book a separate rsvp. So my initial thought was maybe they don't have rooms available (so I inquired) and I was told thy did in fact have rooms available however because it was past 3pm (it was 3:40pm when I called) they can't add or make changes to my current rsvp. 
The lady proceeded to tell me I could cancel however I would have to still pay the full amount (again because it was after 3pm) or get a room for 1 night at another hotel and come to T.I the next day on my original rsvp.

It had everything we needed in the hotel such as restaurants, shops (cvs), bar, pool, and so much more. The staff were so welcoming and were helpful when we needed help (like me getting locked out of my room). 

When checking in there were no ques so we got seen straight away, the woman that was behind the desk couldn't have been more nice and approachable. Everything was done really quick so we were able to go to our room and relax.
  
The hotel was very clean both in and around the hotel, the bedrooms were the right size and the beds were really comfy which we loved after the long plane ride (10 hours). The room had a really nice bathroom with a bath and shower and had a safe which was really great.

The hotel was in a great location on the strip it was a small walk to a few malls, there was a Denny's across the street and a Starbucks right outside the building. There are bus stops all over the place that take you up and down the strip for a really cheap price or the hotel have taxis waiting if you want to go somewhere further out.  .

Katrina checked me in, and was as sweet and helpful as possible.  The room was two queen beds.....no coffee machine...that would have been nice.  Furnishings were clean and tasteful.  Bedding was barely sufficient, I prefer a nice blanket or comforter and there was a very thin blanket on bed.  Pillows and mattress were very comfortable.

The towels were crap....rough and thin....better than nothing, but barely.

Housekeeping did a top notch job of making the room neat and tidy.

My stay here was one to be remembered. I stayed here for 2 days under a package from travelocity, and I got 2 free tickets to Cirque du Soleil Mystere (140-220$ value), and 2 free dinner buffet passes (40-50$ value). The dinner was OKAY (3 star material), but the show was fantastic (5 star material)! Now, onto the rooms. This casino isn't as big as the other casinos, but I would still say that it is a medium, if not large, casino with plenty of slots, 5$ blackjack, and a small poker room. the parking lot is only a short walk away from the hotel elevators\/lobby. The line at the lobby was about 30 minutes, but it wasn't as bad as most negative reviewers claimed it to be. It was a bit long.. but bearable, and the staffs were all very nice and professional. I asked for a room on the higher floors and the guy helped me do that immediately. The pool outside looked very nice and sexy, but because it was high winds when we visited, we didnt get to check it out. 

The room was spacious, and looked very good, similar to that of a half-room at the venetian. The beds were VERY VERY comfortable, and is probably, or if not, similar, to that of the comfortable venetian beds. Treasure Island is relatively clean, but not THOROUGHLY clean; if you know what I mean. By not thorough I mean that I could still see the dust in the hard-to-reach-corners of the rooms. I feel that if the room was more thoroughly organized and thoroughly cleansed it would be like that of the experience at the venetian or bellagio.

overall, the price and deals would be the reason you would go to treasure island. there are constantly free tickets being given away with the purchase of a day or two's booking of this hotel through sites such as travelocity, hotwire, or priceline. If you plan to pay around 200 a night, go to the venetian\/palazzo\/wynn, but if you don't want to spend that much money, but still get a very luxurious experience in vegas, I would recommend Treasure Island (~100$ a night, but sometimes come with free show tickets valued at 70-120$ each + buffets). oh yeah.. sometimes u may get trapped in an elevator.. though probably rare, but if you do, you can get 100$ comped for room service, or perhaps a comped night of stay.. but u should insist it if it happens to you or get skimped out

hope that's helpful",3,2,2

We liked the location of Treasure Island (close to Caesar's Palace, the Bellagio, Mirage and Paris) and it was one of the only hotels left in our price range because we came during a busy weekend.

The hotel is also connected to the Fashion Show Mall and is connected by a walkway. We never went to the mall, but could see it from our room. Our room was a good size, but the walls were paper thin and we could hear everything our loud neighbors were doing next to us and everyone walking down the hallway. Channels on the TV were very limited and hard to find (the navigation menu was atrocious) but the bed was comfortable and the room was clean. Did smell slightly of smoke as did the hallways.

The casino level has a lower ceiling so it does smell really badly of smoke. There are a few restaurants on the same level too (Señor Frogs and a Buffet) but nothing worth stopping at. There is a small gift shop with snacks and alcohol and this is the only place I stopped in because it was next to our elevators and convenient to get to.

Checking in and out was easy and we had no problems. I may stay at Treasure Island again next time I'm in Vegas, but if there was anything else around the same price available, I would stay somewhere else.",16,6,15

You've got to be kidding me!!?!? Why would they even offer a SUITE with one bed? That's ridiculous and we couldn't get one with Two Beds. So 8 girls crammed into that suite with one bed. We manage to accomodate, but it was horrible. There were two bathrooms which was a good thing, but only one shower and so we all had to take turn with the shower. You can imagine how long it would take to get ready in the morning with 8 girls and one shower. Let's just say 3 hours later we still haven't left the room. 

Back to the hotel. I wanted to gamble and I did. It was dead in the casino. I played Blackjack and I never win no matter what!

The rooms at Treasure Island are about average for a strip casino\/hotel.  If you want a nicer room, go to the Hard Rock, Bellagio or Wynn.  We did have the bonus of a room that looked out over the Sirens show, which was kinda neat.

Perhaps my favorite place in this casino is in Kahunaville, a cheesy themed bar\/restaurant.  Note that I said the place was IN Kahunaville.  That place is the oxygen bar off to the side of the entrance.  It seemed a little fruity at first (that's an unfortunate pun, by the way... the O2 is scented) but when we learned that it's a GREAT hangover cure we were hooked.

C checked in before I got there and had to get put in another room because the shower had a hole in the ceiling, part of the drywall fell out. But when he called, the guy at the front desk told him to go to another room and met him there. He said check in time was pretty quick, 5 minutes tops. So customer service was good.

Room is the smallest I've been in so far (out of MGM, Venetian, Palazzo), but it's Vegas. Like you spend any time in your room anyway.

I don't know if this happens to other people, or if I was just drunk, but I slipped in their bathtub. I wasn't expecting the slip and so I hit pretty hard and have a nice bruise on the inside of my right knee to remember my time here. Oh, and then I stepped on a shard of glass in the bathroom. That was fun too.

But the bed is pretty comfy, and we had a great view of the strip from the 15th floor. And I liked the tram that took me to the Mirage even though my friend and I lost $150 there. I like how the rooms have an iPod dock, although it didn't actually charge my iTouch for some reason.

Our view overlooked the pool, and the hot tub is freaking ginormous. It doesn't look like it gets a lot of sun though...but I'm writing this at 9am and one half is decently sunnified (not a word, I know. Sue me.).

My one complaint (apart from almost killing myself in the bathroom, which I'm just going to blame on myself): I love being warm, and I'm normally someone that sleeps under a duvet in the middle of the summer, and I was sweating my ass off in this room. I couldn't even spoon.

We really enjoyed the Cirque de Soleil - Mystere - recommend it highly. They have the popular gaming tables and video machines. The sportsbook is a bit small. Senor Frogs and Gilley's were fun. 

We stayed in a Petite Suite and liked that it had two bathrooms. One bathroom had a large jacuzzi tub and the other had a large shower. A drawback is that a large amount of the room is taken up with the foyer and bathrooms.

I understand that it was late, but we were the only ones in line and they were not busy. Plus, I was invited by the hotel to stay there! 

The room was nice and clean. Three lamps were missing some light bulbs so our room was very dim. Also, two outlets did not work and the Curtain rod was broken so we could not reach to open and close it easily.  

Side note**They may want to rearrange where they put the beds... I'm sure I'm not the only person woken up by other peoples ""night noises"" because the headbords from room to room share a wall.

-Check in- Went very well. My mom had already checked into her room so we just asked if we could be near her. They didn't have anything on her floor so we got one a floor up. There was no line at check in but we got there at 1 am. 

-Room- We had a double bed room on floor 20. It faced the fashion mall. The room was clean and modern. The bathroom was very large and had an awesome tub(sadly I never go to use it). The beds were cozy. Overall good accomodations. The bathroom did not have an exhaust fast so it got pretty steamy in there. The shower head was also a little low for us 6 footers. I managed to flood the bathroom every time I showered. I am not a fan of those cloth shower curtains. I didn't really watch TV. The wifi seemed to work fine, I wouldn't have used it but I did not seem to get 4G in our room. 

-Casino- Casino was smaller with lower ceilings. Not very crowded. Husband did not have luck at most tables. I didn't do that great on roulette either. 

-Food-We only ate at the pizza place and frozen yogurt. Pizza was pretty good and frozen yogurt was ok but lacked rich flavors, price was good though. 

-Pool- We used the pool on a day that wasn't that warm so I only went in the hot tub which wasn't very hot. The DJ was super loud and played music people in their early 20's would like. 

-Location- Almost at the one end but near the places we wanted. I liked the tram to the Mirage and the closeness to the Venetian. 

-Theme- WTF Treasure Island, I don't get you. That is all I kept thinking the whole time we were there. I thought this place was supposed to be pirate themed. They removed the pirate show out front and now just have decoration pirate ships. They have a Pirate themed gift shop and that is where the theming ends. The rest of the hotel is just generic blah theming. There is so much opportunity with this theme and they failed so bad. They have a new sign for the strip and it says TI so it looks like they are going with new theming but that theme sucked too. The colors were ugly together and to primary school looking. This I feel personally is something they need to work on. It is just so generic and boring that I cant even recall the decor. You can do a classy pirate theming. I don't even like pirates and I am demanding them here. Work on this please, k thanks. 

I dont have much else to say, I just mostly wanted to rant about their lack of theming. Overall, the stay was fine. I would go somewhere else next time though. Nothing wrong with this place that is a deal breaker it was just boring and smaller.",2,2,1

We first got 1 king bed and when we went to the counter, we asked for two twins which was perfect. However, they added a $60 fee that everyone had to be charged. I dont know the exact reason but that sucks. The room was alright and had the basic necessities but it definitely is not some luxury hotel. The demographics of people who stay here are all old people haha so we definitely did not fit in. I think all the hip people go to Planet Hollywood like we did last time.

That weekend, we ended up being near MGM during the day and nighttime on Saturday and Sunday daytime so we just paid for taxi so many times. We should have stayed around that area so just make sure that whatever clubs or buffets you hit up, it is close to where you stay so you dont have to taxi all the time. You can walk to Caesars Palace for Serendipitys and buffet from Treasure and it is about a 15-20 minute walk, which is totally doable if you are only going for food and you need to walk it off. I really think Planet Hollywood was an ideal location because it had the mall, Fat Tuesday, and 24 hour Earls. Treasure has the Coffee Shop that is 24 hours but not as good as Earls. 

**TIPS**
1) Cheaper than the other places but not the super best location on the strip.
2) If you plan on going to XS, this is walking distance so no taxi needed!
3) Hotel guests arent the hottest and hippest but it will do.
4) Enjoy!",1,1,0

Since their website showed photos of new remodeled rooms, I figured it had to be better than before.  Plus, it's across from the Palazzo, Venetian, next to Fashion Show Mall, and from the Wynn so it seemed convenient to all the popular places.  The deal was good, $110 a night.  When we got there on Friday night, there was a long line of about 20 people waiting to check-in.  At first, there were only 2 people behind the counter.  20 minutes later, there were about 7 people working.  That was irritating that we had to wait so long to check-in.  They should be well-staffed on the weekends.

We ended up getting the last room in the hall, which was far from the elevator.  At first, we were upset that we had to walk to the last room in the hall, but it ended up being a corner room with 2 big windows on each side so that was pretty cool.  The room was what I expected based on the photos on their website.  The room was pretty spacious and the room had a contemporary look with espresso-colored furniture.  Bathroom was pretty spacious as well.  Loved the comfortable bed and the super long chaise.  

The other thing I noticed was that although we booked a promo on their website, we didn't get all the savings coupons that we were supposed to.  We did get some food coupons, but our promo also included discounts to their spa and their stores, but we never got it.  Since we didn't have time for the spa, we didn't complain about it, but you should make sure you get what you ordered if you go with any of their promos.",0,0,0

I figured I'd at least check with the front desk to see about checking in. The briskly brushed us off and told us to come back at 10 or 11. Okay, whatever. We left our bags with the valet and came back about 10 and were able to check in. It was quick, but probably because the guy didn't say two words to us. We got a basic room on the 31st floor with the crappy window cling cover. The room was clean and no bugs. Small and dark, but clean. There is no where to just grab a bite to eat here. It would be handy to have a fast food place or something quick, convenient and cheap around. We spent almost all of our time at other hotels primarily for this reason.

We got to Vegas early so we ate first, then checked in at 3. As per our initial reservations (MONTHS in advance) I requested that all rooms be on the same floor, and have 4 of the 5 rooms have those connecting doors (2 and 2). At time of check in, they only had 3 rooms ready for us. 1 single room, and 2 that connected, and informed us that our last rooms will be ready in the next hour or so. So we all went up stairs, and pretty much crashed in those 3 rooms. After an hour or so we called down to the front desk to check the status of our rooms. NOTHING. No progress. They said another hour. So we called back around 5:30. Still no progress. I then asked to speak to a manager. He said he'd get right on it, and have housekeeping clean some of the rooms for us to settle in. Shouldn't the rooms already be cleaned as check IN is at 3?! This went on UNTIL EIGHT O'CLOCK at night. Which was ridiculous. Its impossible for 23 girls to rest, and get ready for a night in Vegas in 3 cramped rooms. We were NOT happy. So I called and requested late check out for all 5 rooms. I had to ask 3 times until someone said ok, we'd give each room an extra hour, when I had initially asked for 2. By that time I was beyond frustrated and settled for 1 hour. The rooms itself were decent. Nothing too fancy. Good sized tv, comfortable enough beds. The casino was decent as well, my friend won 1200 on slots, so that was a perk. Buffet was good, nothing spectacular, but it fed us, the employees at the buffet were very nice, and very hospitable.

Customer service: Incredible. Vegas is notorious for treating you like a celebrity, and this couldn't have been more true at TI. We were checked in by Rohit at the front desk, who was the best and answered all our questions! Check-in also moved really quickly compared to other hotels on the Strip. They check room keys at the elevators and are strict with it which is very appreciated as far as security goes. Everyone we interacted with, from restaurant staff to parking valets, was cheery and super helpful. 5 stars. 
Room: We were upgraded to a corner suite with a panoramic view of the Strip *heart eyes*. The ONLY complaint I had about the room was that the AC wasn't very powerful, and only had a ""cool"" setting without a specific temperature setting.

What the aesthetic lacks in modernity (looks pretty 90s) it makes up for in being affordable and pretty spacious! 4 stars. 
They took away the Siren show outside, but the boat remains and is lit up at night which is pretty. Onsite dining options are fairly limited, and they really need a modern and fun indoor bar that isn't themed.

 1.) Parking was relatively easy and close to the casino, short walk to the hotel. 2.) Check in was fast, we were next in line so I did not anticipate much of a wait, but I did expect the usual longer than necessary check in, with the multiple questions and never ending typing. However, I was wrong and it only took about three minutes and I was off to my room. 3.)  Our room was very nice, nicely decorated and spacious for two to four people. All the decor and art looked new and contemporary and added the feel you get when staying at some of the more expensive hotels. The King bed was very comfortable and was on par with some of the beds I've slept on at the Venetian and Encore. I was extremely satisfied with this revelation. Rest room was nice and big, everything worked and everything was clean.  4.)

What the hell was I doing in Vegas then?
I'm a gamer, and Gamestop was having an all-day expo at the Sands. I needed a clean hotel room for a 3-day, 2-night stay.

My hotel requirements:
- Clean, and preferably with white bed sheets\/comforters\/pillow cases
- Convenient location to everything on the Strip
- Affordable

I had been eyeing TI because of its location and price but was having a difficult time choosing which mid-ranged hotel to pick because of Yelp reviews. This has an overall 3.5 rating, which isn't exactly horrible but not great either. An iffy so-so rating made me hesitate to book.

So I decided to let Hotwire decide for me through their Secret Hot Rate selection process and, whaddaya know? They chose TI for me. For reference, TI is considered a 4-star hotel in Hotwire's system.

I was able to check in at about 1-1:30 despite the official check-in time being at 3. The room was located on the 18th floor and didn't have Strip views, but we got better views of the mountains to the west of the 15 freeway. It was roomy enough so the three of us (2 adults, 1 child) didn't feel cramped.

The room featured:
- Two queen-sized beds with all-white bed dressings
- A desk area with ample room for my laptop and convenient three-pronged outlet with direct ethernet cable connection (not supplied)
- A basic flatscreen TV (didn't use at all so unsure about channels)
- Bathroom with complimentary toiletries
- Inside the closet: Iron with board; blowdryer; safe; small refrigerator

Everything was clean and the overall value was great. Can't comment on the casino\/games or any of the hotel's special services, as we didn't use them. What I wanted was a conveniently located Strip hotel with a clean and comfortable room where I could lay my head down at the end of a long, stinkingly hot and humid day, and that's exactly what I got.

Stayed here for 3 nights.

Early checking cost $50 extra. Better than napping in the parking lot with wife, baby and mo in law in our tiny Honda insight.

Not many places to plug in all of our chargers for cell phones so we took turns and used the restroom plugs.

Check in line was always long, with not enough staff to handle it...

Check out was a mad rush too. Vegas wasn't very busy this time of year. End of march.

Parking was free. 

The iPod dock didn't charge the iPod and it had the wrong time.

They had a fridge and safe in the room.

No coffee pot in the room.

The checkout was kind of weird.  I suggest an easy checkout.  Get the folio under your door and just walk out if there aren't any problems with the bill.  We ended up standing in a 30 minute line just to check out.

I have to add a PS.

What a nightmare, I'll never forget this trip - especially because I went for my birthday weekend and the total cost of the 2 nights was close to a grand. Don't get me wrong, I travel to Las Vegas about three times a year (at least) and understand it can be expensive just for a basic room. BUT, I do believe in you get what you pay for and had I known how TI was going to be I would've been happy to pay more and have a more enjoyable weekend. 

I checked in Friday night (late) at 9\/25 to a petite suite for three people. We were on the 23rd floor I believe. I don't typically get large rooms in Vegas so I thought it was pretty nice (not the decor, but the layout). 1 large king bed, a sofa sleeper, two bathrooms, one bathroom had a whirlpool tub while the other had a standing shower. My bf went downstairs to get ice, my brother jumped in the shower and I ordered room service. I went to the bathroom with the tub to start doing my hair and as I look down between my legs a cockroach was crawling right through. UGHHH WHY!!?? Seriously. 1. We just got here 2. I have MAJOR anxiety\/fear of roaches, I can't. I wish my picture was better but I didn't want to get any closer, I about died. 3. Are you kidding me? This is NOT happening. I've stayed in cheaper places in Vegas including Hooters AND Primm at Stateline. Come on now. I'm sure all places have roaches but I don't want to SEE THEM!!!! No way was I staying in this specific room if they're already coming out within the first 15mins to check out their new roommates. I called downstairs and honestly, Sabrina was the only nice person dealing with the situation and sadly I came to find out I'm pretty sure she was just the operator. So I'm on the phone and room service comes up. Please come back later I can't have food in here :'( !!! My brother gets out of the shower and is like no way!!!?? My bf comes up and is like what's going on??? Sabrina calls back with options. 1. Move 2. Someone can come get it out 3. Spray.... I chose to move. So my sister and brother in law come to our room to help us gather everything up. The bell boy comes in and is like *barf* when he sees the roach running around the bathroom. Sabrina tried to make it right by saying we were going to a ""higher end"" room and assured me that the room would be clean - she said ""the maid just left"". And I told her if there was a problem, I'm calling back.... And just my luck ...

Room 2. So this is supposed to be the higher end room. Well now it only sleeps 2 people. So when you walk in the front area looks like a front room with a TV and sofa and dining table. Then doors to go in to the bedroom, king bed, and two bathrooms again. So everyone is like ok this is nice. Not sure where my brother is going to sleep but, oh well.... Wait... What is that? An open condom wrapper on the floor between the nightstand and wall. Is this a joke? I'm being punked right ? Of course I call downstairs again and as I'm on the phone my brother in law sees multiple wrappers and mini lube packages around the area. I wish I had taken a pic of those too but honestly I was fuming at this point and kind of feeling like my bday weekend was pretty much down the drain with my tears building up. Obviously, people do what they do in Vegas- but just like the roach - I DONT WANT TO SEE IT!!!! So what else was not cleaned since this was obviously in plain view. Sabrina answered again and this time sent up a supervisor. Well...... He was actually a ""maintenance manager"". FAIL!! He also had 2 women with him - one of them was the maid who was previously in here. FAIL!!!!!! Nice job putting her on blast. I was very nice to all three and apologetic because I had just moved to this room because of a roach in another. They were like....ok.... so do you want us to clean the area? WOW, GREAT IDEA!!! Absolute joke and complete waste of time!!! It is now after 11 PM and I've been in 2 disgusting rooms, back and forth with the hotel operator and now 3 employees standing in my bedroom with 4 of my family members around like ---- We can throw that stuff away for you. 

I wanted to cry when I checked out because nobody even said sorry about the room situations.  I never asked for anything for free, a discount, a voucher\/coupon or even an apology from the hotel manager. They obviously could care less. I received a survey from TI via email last week and submitted that with honest reviews of the casino, rooms, service, etc. and you would think someone would've contacted me but NO. I never even mentioned that the area that you pass to walk into the whirlpool bathroom smelled like vomit. Kinda like the guy puked on the carpet in the corner after he had sex. So GROSS! I plan on submitting further complaints regarding cleanliness and unsanitary conditions with this hotel. *** Needless to say, I will NEVER stay here again and I will tell everyone I know about my experience.

At first i wasn't expecting much of the hotel, i'm not sure why, even though i read it is a AAA 4 diamond rated hotel some of the pictures online made it seem only decent, and some reviews confirmed the hotel was like that too. 

But when i actually go there, it was a whole different story. From check-in to check-out we had a great time. The staff throughout the hotel is always courteous and friendly. It's rare for me to stay at a hotel like this and get great customer service throughout my entire stay. 

Gotta say, the rooms at TI are really good. The decor was modern and upgraded, and the room was very clean. I liked that the bathroom was also not only clean, but is designed nicely and comes with toiletries branded with TI's spa name. The fact that you get a ""massage soap"" is pretty nice too :D But the room is definitely the thing i loved the most about this hotel. The bed was really clean and just super soft pillows and comforter. Felt great knocking out on it after a good night of partying at Tao.  There are some things i didn't like though, the TV was kinda small. Although it had a decent amount of channels to watch, it was probably around 27"" which is a little small for such a nicely upgraded room....but then again when your in Vegas your not there to watch TV are you? Another thing i didn't like was there's no in room fridge, it would have been nice to have one. I didn't see that you could add it anywhere either, i'm not sure if the hotel has the option to add one to your room either.  I also didn't like that the resort fee was nearly $25 but with it you get a $20 credit for your next stay and free Wifi, plus access to some other stuff at the hotel, so the resort fee more than makes up for itself considering you get that $20 credit and Wifi is i believe ~$15 a day.  Btw the Wifi at TI is pretty damn fast for a hotel wifi, i'm a techie so i did a speedtest, 9Mbps down, 2Mbps up, maybe my room was just in a good spot, but its much better than any other Hotel i've stayed at on the strip so far. 

Sirens of TI was a great little show too. I enjoyed it, if you want to watch it make sure you get there at least 30 mins before the show starts. You'll already see everyone trying to find a good spot around that time. Hotel guests get ""VIP Seating"" to the show, i thought that was nice, although i didn't end up using this cuz i watched the show as a last minute thing instead. lol. It doesn't last long, definitely not more than half an hour, but its entertaining. 

The Casino inside the hotel is pretty good as well, not crowded and its one of the better ones if your like me and don't like inhaling huge amounts of second hand smoke every time you come to step into a Vegas casino. There's a lot of staff on hand if you have any issues\/questions too. 

Other things i liked about the hotels are the location of course, its right on the strip not far from the big hotels you probably wanna hang out at. There's also the free tram to Mirage, which makes it much easier to get around and cuts down a good amount on walking if your heading that way. Restaurants are really good at TI too, the Coffee Shop is my favorite, don't let the name fool you, its much more than a coffee shop, they serve Mexican food and some kick-ass burgers too! 

All in all, i had a great stay at TI and TI is on my top 3 list for Vegas hotels now, right next to Venetian and Wynn\/Encore. TI might not be as ""flashy"" as Venetian or Wynn\/Encore, but its pretty affordable and you get a great room with great service that's right on the strip!",4,0,0

The hotel made it super difficult to check in because the rooms were booked by my employer, even though the rooms were under my name. Finally after two hours of waiting and speaking to a manager, the situation was rectified around 1am. I was a bit annoyed by the amount of time I waited to be checked in, primarily due to the fact that I was on a business trip and needed to report to work at 9am. As I walked into my room I was initially pleased. The room seemed clean and comfortable. I put my bags away and walked into the bathroom. Everything in the bathroom looked fine at first glance, I lifted the toilet seat to pee and began to see a brown liquid leaking from the toilet seat. I decided to check into it and put the seat down. What I found startled me and disgusted me more than anything I've ever witnessed. The toilet seat was covered with shit!!!!!

I was arriving into LV on a Friday while most of my girls were arriving Saturday night since they all had to work Saturday morning.  But I had other friends who were already in town so it wouldn't have been that difficult to find a spot to crash just for one night....

So I basically had two choices for my Friday night accommodation:
1) Cram myself into a room with 7 boys, 1 king bed, a small ""L"" couch and plenty of floor (marble) space... or
2) Cram myself into a room with 8 girls, 2 queen beds and 1 bathroom.

The more I thought about it, the more I hated my choices.  So, of course, I opted for choice #3 - get my own digs for the night! My search began on Thursday afternoon (yes, the day before!).  It took a bit of research but I finally settled for a room at the Treasure Island and I just booked through their website and signed up for the MyTI guestbook membership.  

It was a really good deal - $138 for 1 night stay in a Deluxe room on a FRIDAY night! Of course, there's a $20 resort fee per day (you get internet access, fitness center access, print your boarding passes, 2-for-1 cocktail, etc), but they give you a $20 credit towards a future stay so it basically pays for itself if you're an avid LV visitor.  Apparently, I was extremely lucky to be able to get a room because I found out that they were booked solid because of the UFC weekend! Crazy.  And when I checked in, I got upgraded to a suite FOR FREE. This suite, could easily have fit 4 girls (there was a huge king bed and a couch) and - omg - there were two bathrooms!  No view, but was extremely comfortable.  More than enough for a one night, last minute, stay for myself or 1-4 people and perfect for a group of girls since there are two bathrooms.  Another bonus was their checkout is anytime before noon.  I couldn't do a late checkout on Saturday but that was understandable since they were completely booked.  

The only thing I could complain about is I did express checkout from the TV in the room but in order to get a receipt I would've had to stand in a line at the check out counter in order to get it.  Instead of waiting in line, I gave an employee my email address to get a receipt emailed to me but it has been almost a week since I stayed and I haven't received my receipt!

But for now, a 3-star rating is the best I can give.

Our room was absolutely great.  The whole floor appeared to have been recently remodeled.  The view from the room included the fun of the strip and the beauty of the red rocks to the West.  The bed was a dream with comfie mattress and covers.  

The restaurant in the Casino--Isla--was very good!  Seafood enchiladas, yummmmm.  Also the Lemon Drop at the bar--made by  Augie--was perfect.

Hopefully the spa will open soon.  We were directed over to the Trump for spa services and it was not a good experience.  Do not go there.

I got fooled into booking this place through Priceline. I really wanted to stay at the South end of the strip because I usually stay there. When Priceline didn't want to accept my original bid, I decided to expand my search to the North end, thinking that maybe I'd get Caesar's Palace or the Mirage. Nope, I got stuck with Treasure Island. Just great.

There's only two positive things I can say about the hotel so I'll get those out of the way:
1. If you want to be close to the Fashion Show Mall and the Venetian\/Palazzo, it's right across from both places. 
2. I had a perfect view of the strip and could see that outdoor Sirens show from my room.  It was a neat to see fireworks from my bed.

Now the bad stuff:
1. The $22.50 resort fee. The only good thing about that was that it included the WiFi fee which would've been $15 a night. All the other crap it included like the 2 for 1 stuff was useless to me because I was staying by myself. And $20 credit for my next stay? Puh-lease.
2. Check in begins at 11 AM. I have stayed at so many different hotels in Vegas and this is the first place I've been to where they've enforced that. I've gone to the Palms at 9 AM and they've had a room ready for me. I got there at 10:15 AM and was waiting in the wrong line for 10 minutes until someone told me where the check-in line was (which wasn't marked at all). I sat down on the carpeted floor for about 40 minutes until the line started moving. There must've been at least 30 people in line by then and there were only 2 staff members checking people in. 
3. Small room. Not a huge flat screen TV. Bathroom needs more handles in the shower\/tub. (I work in the travel\/hospitality industry, I know this stuff)
4. Housekeeping sucks. I left the ""service please"" sign on my door when I left my room for brunch and when I came back to my room about six hours later, my room was left unlocked with the deadbolt sticking out. There wasn't a service cart around the hall either so I don't know why my door was left open. I was freaking out because I had my laptop in my room and all my other valuables too. Thankfully none of my valuables were missing but I was still upset knowing they could've easily been stolen. 
5. The casino smells awful. 

Lesson learned about booking Vegas hotels on Priceline. I'll stick with the Vegas hotels I know.",3,2,0

3 stars. No more, no less. 

We stayed at Treasure Island the weekend of the Las Vegas Rock 'N' Roll Marathon. By the time we picked up our race packets and made the obligatory booth rounds at the Expo we checked into the hotel's last available room: standard smoking with two double beds. Despite our room smelling like a dirty ashtray I was just thankful we were able to get a room at all (#missusbrightside). Treasure Island was one of the official race hotels and you know what that means: the place was packed to the rafters.

Room availability issues and lack of basic amenities (e.g., coffee maker and hair dryer) aside we had a relaxing stay at Treasure Island. The hotel did, however, provide us with extra towels and an assortment of mild-scented toiletries from their in-house spa, so that was appreciated. Fully functional bathroom. Quiet, comfortable, and clean room. Overall the hotel was decent for the price. 

Yo-Ho-Ho: 
-Reasonable rates. 
-Free parking.
-Buffet was surprisingly decent. 
-No annoying salespeople! Unlike the Luxor we did not have to contend with pesky salespeople trying to sell us a timeshare.
-Located next to Fashion Show Mall!

It was centrally located on the strip, close to shopping and other hotel\/casinos. The pricing for the rooms was great, although they do get you with the $20 resort fee if you're not planning on taking advantage of the coupons and amenities.

The one major issue I had was with the hotel check-in. We checked it at 4:30 on a Monday and the line was literally 30 - 40 people long. It took over half an hour to check in, and after working a full day, the last thing I wanted to do was wait in a Disneyland-sized line. We had thought it was a computer issue, but when we got to the front we were told that it's usually that busy.

The Breeze Bar is a good place to get some drinks, but if you're looking for good wine, the Italian restaurant is where you really want to go. The menu for the Breeze Bar says you can ask for a larger wine selection menu, but they didn't have one. So that was a little weird.

The rooms were much nicer than expected. The bed was comfortable, and I want those pillows for my house. They're full and comfortable, with not too much give. The blinds blocked out all of the light from the strip (super important!) and everything looked well-maintained.

One weird thing was that my friend opened a drawer to put her clothes away and found a full drawer of someone else's clothes in there. I think housekeeping usually checks drawers at other hotels when cleaning, so may have just been an oversight.

First off, I just have to say that I come to vegas all the time and typically stay at planet hollywood where i have no problems whatsoever. However, on this particular occasion, i went for a friends 21st birthday and didn't make the reservation myself thus, i was forced into staying at this crappy hotel.

Now mind you, my friends and I have gotten into all the biggest cubs on the busiest nights for free with no problems. After a long time of partying, we figured we'd stop into Gilley's (located inside TI) for a casual drink. The bouncer checked our ID's and stamped everyone in our party except for my cousin. He called over 5 security guys and the ""head of security"" was a total dick. He told her that she stole someone else's ID even though it was hers and it DID look like her! She showed him all her credit cards, her emails, and basically the entire contents of her purse to prove it was her and he still didn't believe her! anyways after being hassled for 20 minutes, he said he could refuse service to anyone and decided not to let us in. Needless to say, we flipped him the bird.

At check out, they overcharged our party plus charged the hotel room on the card we had given them to hold the room though we told them our party was paying in cash!

Then...we tried to go to the pool after we had checked out but they hassled us about needing a room key but we had turned them all in so we couldn't go in even though we had proof we had stayed there (valet cards, receipts, etc). Ugh! I finally found a key that I hadn't turned in and we got into the pool (which btw wasn't worth searching in my purse for 5 minutes).

We were so sick of everything and thank God we were finally leaving! However, the valet took literally 40 minutes to get us our car plus, when we got it back, the anti-theft on the car had been disarmed and it was clear someone had been in my cousin's car and had tampered with it! EPIC FAIL! That's not how we expect to get our car back after giving it to valet. After all, isn't the point of valet to make your stay more convenient and keep your car safe?

My cousin DID end up complaining and they apologized (barely) and offered a suite upgrade on our next visit. Unfortunately for them, there won't be a next visit. We'll opt to pay full price anywhere else in return for our safety and enjoyment.",4,6,3

The rooms are well appointed, the bathroom clean, however, the rug that led to the room was dirty. Looked like someone poured some dark liquid or something and no one has gotten around to cleaning it.The front desk was pretty friendly even though I didn't book through them directly. Ivy at the concierge area booked my shuttle for me and was a wealth of other local information that you would not find on any guide.

I left my luggage at the bell desk since I had a couple of hours between shuttle pick up and when I checked out. I thought it was a great service until I ran across this bell desk agent that was more into getting a tip from me. He hadn't even taken my luggage and he was already telling me he would take care of my luggage with his hand motioning for money. He repeated himself that he would take care of my luggage but he didn't think that he would be there in 2 hours when I returned and then motioned again for money. Such a turn off! When I told him I didn't have any change on me (which was true - I was not about to fork over a $20), he told me he would give me change. This is just poor taste!

The Tower Suite was more than enough space for the 9 of us -- there was a King-sized bed (sleeps 3 people), an L-shaped couch (sleeps another 3), plus we asked for a cot (slept 1 person), and ample floor space (slept another 2).

With floor to ceiling glass windows, we also had a perfect view of the Pirates and fireworks show every night (although at times, since we were so close to the show, the sound of the fireworks scared the crap out of me when the curtains were closed).

Treasure Island, or, TI as it's called now, is a pretty good hotel in Vegas. not the best, but certainly not the worst. it's definitely geared towards the 20- and 30-something crowd, and is shaking off its once family-based friendly pirate theme. arrrrrgh, matey!

the rooms are fairly standard - no fridge, but the bathroom is big. we had a 32nd floor room, with a view directly above the pirate ship.

speaking of which, the Sirens show has strippers, pirates, and explosions. it's like if Michael Bay did ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" as a live theater show. in other words, AWESOME.

the bed...holy crap, I don't think I've slept in a better bed in any hotel ever before! I passed right out each night (that may also have been partially due to lots of partying, but I didn't wake up once during each night).

guests at the hotel get coupons to the shop, the restaurants, VIP passes to the Sirens show, and free access to the Christian Audiger club.

one last thing, the location is awesome - a majority of the hotels are right nearby (okay, ""right nearby"" in Strip terms means a 10-15 minute walk).

Good: room looked like it was recently remodeled, nice TV, radio w\/ the iPod dock, a comfy lounge chair to take a nap on.
Bad: bathroom could use some work, no fan, no heatlamp.
Good: Pirate show in the front.
Bad: the margarita stand by the pirate show was always closed!  I never got a huge margarita in a skull mug!
Good: the tequila bar was a nice place to grab a drink with pretty good beers for $5.50.
Bad: the classic margarita was far from classic.
Good: plenty of slot machines.
Bad: not enough bars.
Good: Starbucks on the first floor to keep you going, or get you going.
Bad: the cinnamon roll I had was way stale.

For starters, Gilley's is a BBQ\/cowboy\/southern themed restaurant. I like BBQ but it was a group decision on coming here and not my own. 

The menu here is huge, there were so many options it was difficult to decide on what to get. I think huge menus are generally a bad thing, because it is difficult to be good at ""everything"". 

I decided on the veal short rib with mixed vegetables and mac n cheese as my sides. The meal also came with corn bread muffins and possibly some other stuff I don't remember. 

The meals took a little bit to get out but I can let that go as our party was more than 12 people and they probably felt that we wanted to break bread together. Understandable. 

The food itself was not that great. I was reminded of sit down family chain joints such as Applebee's, Chili's, etc. My short rib tasted dry and overcooked. Some of the food was lukewarm (probably from us having to break bread together). I can't speak for anyone else, but one of my friends did comment on his meal being the same afterward.  

The service on the other hand was awesome. Vegas was dead this time of year, but the staff didn't drop their customer service levels one bit. We were well tended to with drinks, napkins, or whatever kind of bullshit large groups need in restaurants. 

I didn't think the prices were too bad, especially since Vegas charges extra for everything simply for being in Vegas. I had my entree, several drinks for myself, and several drinks for others and the bill was only $73 (excluding tip). I was expecting for it to be over a $100 for sure. 

Overall I think if you're in Ti and don't want anything fancy for dinner with your guy\/girl, or friends I think you'd be better off getting Canter's or the buffet than Gilly's.",1,0,0

This hotel is pretty clean and updated! The decor in the rooms isn't too modern but it is modern enough. We had a weird experience just because there was something wrong with our bath tub.... It wasn't draining so this moldy stench started smelling in our room. After we called the lobby, the front desk had someone immediately fix it for us! Thank goodness!

If you drive to Vegas like I did you will find parking at the hotel very convenient...the parking garage is located right off the freeway at Spring Mountain Rd....no hassle dealing with Las Vegas Blvd. traffic.

Check-in process was very long around 11:30 AM....roughly 30 minute wait.

Rooms were decent for $75\/night. Beds were very comfortable and the room was clean and looked newly renovated. TV was on the smaller end but then who watches TV while they are in Vegas. 

Casino was nicely laid out and I was always able to play one of my favorite games.

The location of TI is in a nice spot if you like visiting the hotels on the north strip. There is a tram that will take you to the Mirage and from there you can easily walk to Caesars or Bellagio. You can also leave TI and walk to the Wynn or Venetian which is across the street. 

Overall the hotel is a great value. Other hotels in this area are asking $200+\/night (weekends). This hotel works well if you are on a budget and looking to crash somewhere comfortable.

I stayed here Memorial Day weekend with my friend and I'll say that we got a really good price (it was bundled so I can't really break out the actual price but we paid about $350 each for round trip airfare and 4 nights\/3 days at TI). So the price deserves a star.

I'll give them two stars for their location. We were pretty much smack-dab in the center of the strip so taxi cabs weren't too expensive and we were close to Ceasar's shopping and the fashion mall.

As for the cons--I was pretty disappointed that when I came into the room and checked my sheets, I found that BOTH beds had stains on the sheet. I mean there's a reason why sheets are white....so let's keep them white! I will give them kudos for sending someone up at 8:45PM to change my sheets when I called room service. However, the new sheets that replaced the sheets STILL had stains. I don't know if the stains are from the washing machine being old or if it's from overloading it.

I was also disappointed that they didn't have our room cleaned in a timely fashion. We had been out for most of the day and when we came back at 4PM, we still did not have our room cleaned. I think they were on their way but by that time we felt it was too late for them to come and clean. We really only needed towels so it wasn't a big deal but I stopped by one of the other ladies cleaning the rooms and asked if she could give me 4 new towels and she seemed to be really bothered by giving me new towels. My Spanish isn't that good so I couldn't tell exactly what the issue was but I had gone for two days without a room clean, so I needed new towels. 

Another disappointment was that on our last night, we called room service at 4:30AM and they told us it was going to take 1.5 hours before we got any food.

Last disappointment was that they wouldn't give me a late check out. I mean, I understand that it was a crowded weekend so it was fine but considering they hadn't been cleaning my room for the entire trip, I figured they could cut us a little bit of slack and give us a late check out. Sure enough at 11AM housekeeping came and knocked on the door to start cleaning.

We talked with players club, marketing, casino host, blah blah blah. 

No internet unless pay for it...are you kidding me?? Rooms were ok, but see pics of gross blood stain above bed, filth in bathroom, rotting doors, etc. Beds very comfortable, but a blanket instead of sheets would be nice. 

The Coffee Shop...host and asst manager rude!! Ozzie great. Went daily and had Antoinette brought us fruit plate, bill right after and never returned. After 25 minutes of seeing her walk around other part of dining area like a zombie, my sister tracked down some1 to take care of bill. Then, they never came back with our credit card. So, after another 10 minutes, she chased lady around restaurant to ask where card was....got it back. Talked to snotty asst mgr in suit at counter who cared less...said nothing, did nothing except tried to argue bc there was another name on bill other than Antoinette and we didnt want her to get in trouble so said it wasnt her. He was like...""u didnt c her she is a cashier in back."" Who cares? Ok. She wasnt problem. Then he argues that we couldnt have seen Antoinette walking around bc she was on break....really for 35 minutes?? And does she walk around restaurant during it? All i know is he didnt care even though we were spending $50+ daily there plus $10 tip. He should have discounted the bill...nothing or at least showed some empathy!!  rude!!

Even though checked in during late evening...couldnt stay in 1 of our 2 rooms til we headed out to airport. 

We had buffet coupons and hostess wouldnt let us use them. Friday lunch buffet AWFUL!!! Turkey dry, potatoes cold, fruit tasteless, ribs hard and dry....desserts....strawberries white, chocolate brownie delicious! Eclaire frozen...ick. pumpkin squash soup tasteless...DO NOT WASTE UR MONEY! gentleman who helped us was very nice. 

Seafood 2 for 1....lobster mac good, pan roasted lobster...uncooked...couldnt cut with knife...waiter never came back and asked how it was, scallops great! Mussels ok, clams...1 excellent, 2nd popped when getting out of shell and a black goo was all over...double ick! The shrimp were good but small. The rice, nut dish with seafood was excellent! Best ever had. 2 for 1....use on something easy.

Richies....a lot of food, very friendly service. Id suggest they sell half portions for half price or 2 people split 1 meal.

Check in: The front desk was SUPER FAR from the parking structure. We literally walked across the entire hotel just to get our key to the room. The check in process went pretty smoothly. There were many people standing in line so there were many workers at the front desk. The guy that checked me in gave me a map of all the things inside the hotel and a huge coupon book for eateries. None were too appealing so we didn't use any of them.

Eateries: most of the had low reviews on Yelp so we didn't really want to try them. There is a ""fat tuesday"" look alike bar near the parking structure, but we didn't purchase anything. They sell Krispee Kreme donuts throughout the hotel, and apparently there's different deals depending on the time of day. We went late at night and got each donut for $1. I think there was a cheaper deal because the cashier kinda slipped up and mentioned it and then retracted her statement because the ""sign wasn't outside so she couldn't offer us that deal"" - i think it was 50cents per donut. There's a huge starbucks inside, but it's ""not a corporate office"" so you can't use your birthday drink there.

Ambience: It's just like any Las Vegas hotel, filled with the smell of cigarette smoke. You need to have your room key out or the guy won't let you into the elevators. And the elevators are set up differently, they have a certain number of stairs at one elevator and the other half at another.

I had to call literally 4 times in order to get help from the front desk on how to log into the internet because each time, their directions were so unclear.

Positives: great location on the strip. Access to the fashion show mall walkway from hotel.  A variety of restaurant options to choose from although the only one that I actually liked and visited more than once was the café downstairs which is also a pho restaurant; it had a great breakfast! Valet parking was quick and professional. The rooms were spacious and updated. I appreciated the staff checking for keys to insure that only hotel guests were allowed into the room areas (although the truth of the matter is I could return with my old key and access the floors). I paid for the early\/VIP check in ($30 in advance or $40 at hotel) and in spite of it being such a busy time my check in was quick and easy. Please note, however, if you don't opt to pay for this service your wait was over an hour! I loved that there was a Starbucks right outside the door that was 24 hours and the one in the hotel stayed open until midnight. I liked having a refrigerator in the room.
Negatives: the walls are paper thin; I could hear the entire conversation of the people in the room next door and my television was turned up pretty loud. I am a cautious gambler and I didn't appreciate them having no $5 tables. The housekeeping is bad; the toilet wasnt clean, the towels had brown stuff on them, and the shower was not cleaned. I requested that all the above be cleaned and they complied BUT I should not have to request that. I feel like in a city like Vegas (that never sleeps), they should have microwaves in the room. I ABSOLUTELY hated that they did not have HGTV!!! The only thing I hated more was the view! All the rooms on one side of the hotel (and that's a LOT of rooms!!!) have the worst view on the strip (I SERIOUSLY considered checking out just because of the view!)-it is of the trump hotel!!!

To get to floors 31 and above, you will need to slide your room key inside the elevator. I stayed in the executive suite with a view of the strip. The view was AH-MAZE-ING. Palazzo was sitting directly in front of us, and I could see the TI ship right below.

The suite was on the smaller side, but it was enough to fit four girls. We had a king bed with THE most comfortable bed I have EVER slept in. There's also a small plasma that you can angle so you can watch TV from your bed. There's a glass wall directly in front of the bed. The glass is the type where you can't see through it. On the other side is the long couch that can fit two people, a refridgerator, a large plasma, and a big desk that faces the strip. 

For a group of girls, the idea of having two separate bathrooms is genius. One bathroom had a shower and the other had a huge tub. There is also a big dresser where you can put your folded clothes, and a closet in each bathroom. I wish they had switches for the fans in their bathrooms. The only way you can turn them on is through the AC switch. When you choose to turn on the fan, you will have no choice but to have the fan on in your room too. 

All of my meals this weekend were from room service. For a late night snack Friday, we ordered chicken noodle soup. The chicken was super dry and it had small strips of carrots. It was okay, definitely not the best I've had. For breakfast, I had the ""eggs any style"" which came with two egg whites, 3 big round pieces of sausage, hash brown, and sourdough bread. Again, nothing over the top. It was diner quality. I wasn't a fan of their sausage, but it was between bacon and sausage and I hate bacon. 

For dinner, we had the vermicelli with bbq pork. Do not order the pho! Read my review on their restaurant. The vermicelli was undercooked, kind of hard to swallow down. The pork had a lot of fat on it, but I like fat! You get four eggrolls if you order the appetizer. Not what I remembered when I ate it at Pho. Super dry and taste wasn't all that. 

Their buffalo wings were grosse. It was overly salty and it tasted like it was marinated in tobasco sauce. The actual wings were a good size with lots of meat on them. Unfortunately, the taste killed it. The clubhouse sandwich was a nice size, but their french fries were too salty.  They were big thick fries, but we simply couldn't finish all of it because of the saltiness.

The lady that took our orders on the phone was super friendly. We had a short conversation after I ordered, but I was impressed with her customer service.

TIP: If you order room service, remember that gratuity is already included in your bill. When they bring you the check, there's a space for you to leave tip. We knew gratuity was already included, so we never added more tip. This seemed to have pissed off the guy that brought us our food, because he never thanked us or even cracked a smile. What a jerk!

If you want Social House, you'll have to eat at their restaurant. No room service from them BOO! Valet has been consistently great. I just wanted to get my sunglasses and sandals from the car, and they had someone run to the car to get it for me. If you want to take a taxi, it's across the way from the entrance to the casino.

Decent hotel with decent food. No more TI for awhile!",5,2,2

It obviously isn't a luxurious hotel but we had a good experience and I'd consider staying here again.

The hotel is very easy to get to off the 15, and we self-parked easily.  The registration area was a bit of a walk from the garage, but that didn't hugely matter.  There was a line for registration but it moved rather quickly so, again, not a huge deal.  

We stayed in their regular ol' Deluxe room on the 7th floor, with a beautiful view of the roof.  The air conditioners or the ventilation system on the roof make a lot of noise, but my husband and I like having white noise when we're trying to sleep so that was not really a negative for us.  But - they are loud, and I could see someone getting PO'ed about it if they need peace and quiet.  The Deluxe rooms feature tiny fridges that take forever to get cold but eventually chilled our vodka and wine, so all was well. :)  The room was clean, but really dark; there was a tiny lamp on the desk, a floorlamp and florescent lights over the bed, and even with all of them on it was pretty dark all the time.

The only restaurant we tried there was the Coffee Shop for breakfast;  I think the meat-less skillet I had was ~$15, which is a little ridiculous, unless you're in Vegas I guess.  Portions were big, at least.

The one pretty big downside was that our room had doors connecting us to the other room next door, and the people staying there was so freaking loud.  Or maybe not, maybe having the doors serves to amplify the noise from your neighbors.  But at one point, before I realized what the issue was, I honestly thought they had a group of 10 people shouting right next to our hallway door.  But, no, just 3 middle-aged women gettin' drunk in Vegas.  Which is cool, but please shut the hell up at 3 am - your jokes are not funny and the sound of your incessant laughing is annoying.

TI is a bit older hotel, but still a good bang for the buck.  It is decently located on a bit of the mid to north end of the strip, but still access to a lot of other big names that surround it, including Caesars, The Venetian and Fashion Show Mall.  (Really centrally located if you plan to do a bit of shopping in Vegas).  Not the biggest hotel, not the best restaurants, not the best shows or the best of anything at all, but not too bad either.

We stayed in a Petite Suite, which isn't really a suite, except for having two bathrooms and room for a pull-out couch.  They are going for a his and her's bathroom I guess.  It is a good room for a couple.  I haven't stayed in anything smaller there, and not sure if I would want too.

The one bathroom has the standard stall shower with maybe the worst shower head ever.  Not adjustable at all, and this one was a bit limey so the water wasn't the smoothest flow.  The other bathroom has a giant two person hottub, which is very nice and fun.  There is also a mini fridge in there, but no actual minibar.

The bed was really comfortable, one of the better hotel beds I have slept in (assuming you like the soft pillow-top type mattresses, not the best if you like them firm *giggle*).  The couch was pretty decent, though nobody pulled it out to sleep on it.  T^he desk and little bar like table (with bar-like stools) in the corner seemed like they may have come from Ikea.


As for the rest of the hotel, we didn't spend too much time there, so the review is going to be mostly limited to the room.  Additional, the :20 dollar trick"" was successful in getting us upgraded to a high floor with a strip view, and a comped bottle of champagne.

Well I have to say that it delivered big time...decently sized room and comfortable to boot, not that much time was spent in the room.

It is a great location and walking to our favorite places isn't too bad. It is the closest hotel to Fashion Plaza Mall. It also has a 24 hour Starbucks and CVS right in front of hotel entrance. We went mid June. We took a day two trip, and drove from Phoenix. It was about a five hour drive of just cactus, and dry desert. However, we knew we were getting closer to the strip when we saw bright lights starting to blind us, and we got giddy like two children in a candy store. We opted for self parking which was free. We were casino invited guests so we got to bypass the long line, and was just behind two people. There were several agents behind their desks, however only four were actually helping guests. Not sure what was going on there? However, the man who helped us was pleasant, and quick. We were on the 32nd floor with a Panoramic view of the strip. It was beautiful! The room was clean and spacious. 
 
The morning of checkout, we were both so exhausted so we decided to ask for a late check out. We called the front desk and they said $56.00, which was reasonable for two people whom barely slept for four hours in the last fourth-eight hours. It is only $ 30.00 if you decide to pay for late check out while booking your hotel room on their site. What was a little inconvenient was the housekeeping staff kept knocking and trying to open our door about three times while we were trying to catch up on some much needed sleep. We really didn't have any strength to say that we paid for late checkout, we assumed they would have been notified by the front desk.. I guess not. 

Every staff member we came in contact with was ready to help, and always had a smile on their face. Except one Debbie downer that seemed to be the supervisor\/ manager at the Player's Club Desk. The employee that was helping us was courteous, and making conversation with us. She was waiting for another employee to call her back once he updated some account information, so my boyfriend could get his free slot play. While we were waiting she was talking to us, and two other guests lined up. Then the manager, in front of us bluntly asked her if she needed help. The manager didn't once smile or acknowledge us (the hotel guests). The employee then said to the manager with a smile that she was waiting for another employee, and the manager didn't say anything else and just walked away. She could have helped the other guests who were waiting instead of talking rudely to her employee. I'm not sure if she was having a bad day, or what but my boyfriend and I were not pleased with her attitude in the situation. She could have handled that situation a few different ways, like came close to her employee and just ask in a nicer tone how everything was going etc..

Moved over to the Red Rocks Resort for a couple days after we left here, I would have rather stayed here.",0,0,0

Usually stay at higher-scale hotels when I go with my parents, or lower-scale hotels when I go with friends. But this time, got the Spa Suite at Treasure Island. The room was a little smaller than I imagined, but quite nice. Two bathrooms, one with shower and the other a giant tub. Had a nice north view of the Strip as well. 

Like most casinos\/hotels, Treasure Island had everything. Had the lunch buffett one day, and the Vietnamese restaurant next to the cafe another day. Both were good! Caught the Mystere show one night. Check-in and check-out were speedy. 

One of the best things about Treasure Island is the location. It's one of the few hotels that isn't priced sky high and still located in the middle of everything. I heard the Fashion Mall across the street isn't too great, but at least it's across the street. 

I guess my only complaint about this place was how long it took to get a new blow dryer delivered from housekeeping. It seriously took 40 minutes, 4 phone calls, and a dozen apologies. And the replacement didn't work either.

Other than that, I'd definitely stay at Treasure Island again!",2,0,1

The location isn't the best because its almost at the end of the strip, but in all reality it isn't bad.. it's just a little walk up towards Caesar's Palace and the Bellagio area. Plus.. you get to see some interesting things on your walk.. ;) 

If you are here to party instead of having the classy visit in a penthouse this is a pretty cool place. It has good views (if you get the right room) and you will run into some fun people. 

The pirate's\/sirens show was out of commission when I was there--boo to that. 

They have a pretty cool casino and it's actually pretty big--I got lost getting back to my room. Yikes! (Maybe that was the alcohol.. ha)

I stayed here while driving across the country with my friends & it was our best night across the states... so hopefully this is helpful! ENJOY SIN CITY!

I am going to be honest with you I would not have stayed here if it hadn't been for Groupon. I always thought of Treasure Island as a hotel for families (Kids). This is not the case! Right when we walked in it was very clean and the appearance is upscale. But we still weren't convinced yet, any hotel can put up a nice front. 

You know when you see pictures of hotels online and the rooms and the other parts of the hotel don't look as extravagant, well in my opinion Treasure Island is a Hotel that the Pictures did not do it justice. The casino area was very clean it can seem like a maze at first but with a drink in hand you won't mind the extra walking when you get lost and there is plenty to keep your eyes and your mind busy while you walk. My favorite Bar in Treasure Island is the Breeze Bar. The atmosphere is great and they had a wide variety of liquors (I personally am a scotch person and they have great scotch names and ages). 

We spent a lot of our time at the hotel so we enjoyed some of the eateries they had to offer. We ate at Gilley's BBQ, we got the appetizer Nachos but we asked for everything to be put on the side of the Nachos because we weren't entirely sure about all the toppings that would be on them, and let me tell you this was a great idea because the portion was huge, so we were able to enjoy the Nachos later in our hotel room without the chips being soggy from the toppings and it was not as messy. The main course I had the ribs which were not good they very obviously use an artificial smoke flavor that made the ribs disgusting. So all in all I highly recommend you go to Gilley's BBQ for the Nacho appetizer but not the Ribs I can't say much about the other Entrée's. 

We ate at The Coffee Shop for breakfast (yes that is what it is called (not confusing at all (sarcasm))), the breakfast was great! They have very healthy breakfast options. I highly recommend this place for breakfast. We also ate at Pho Vietnamese to satisfy a late night craving and it was good, nothing to rave about but it was good. 
Our Groupon included Mystère by Cirque du Soleil and a Spa visit. The show was amazing I really enjoyed it. It's not just singing and dancing it has some comedy entwined, the music is great I actually bought the CD from the gift shop afterwards. We were so busy while we were there that we actually never made it to the Spa so I can't opinionate on that. 

We also had a Groupon for the Kahunaville for a meal and drinks, let me tell you first off we didn't use it. I felt like Kahunaville is Treasure Islands downfall, but it's so far out of the way that if you didn't know about it before hand or go to the Cirque du Soleil show (it's across from the show entrance) you wouldn't know it was there. When I was there I felt like the inside was not that nice looked a little worn, the placement of things just isn't appealing and the speakers were all treble no base (which is hard on your ears). We walked in and stood at one of the standing tables for a few minutes before deciding the place sucked and our heads hurt from the poor quality speakers. Kahunaville not recommended!

Over all I would recommend staying at the Treasure Island. The mattress was so comfortable, I have never had comfort like this on my mattress at home or any other hotel mattress. I actually bought a new mattress when I got home and used my Treasure Island experience as the comfort level to meet. The pillows were the same and I have not yet found a pillow to match those pillows. We fell asleep when we hit the mattress and had the best sleep of our lives. The rooms are very clean and very modern. You don't have to gamble to have fun at Treasure Island. All I can say is don't judge Treasure Island by its cover like I did. I will be staying at Treasure Island again next time in Vegas who know's maybe I'll see you around.",4,4,4

The rooms themselves are okay. Nothing fancy! Our room smelled like a tortilla factory when we first walked in. The tv is a nice size. The beds are comfy with a variety of different pillow types. The only thing I didn't like was that the window was small and in a corner. The lighting is very dim in the room.
We normally stay at the Aria so we are used to big windows. We didn't expect the high tech technology but we also didn't expect a tiny corner window. 
The bathroom itself has a nice tub. It's upgraded up to date over all.
The carpets are disgusting but what else can you expect from a 20+ year old hotel. The room was a 7\/10 because it was clean! I did my OCD examination and I couldn't find a bed bug, stains, or left over trash. 

Housekeeping is incredibly persistent!! They knocked 3 times the 2nd day we were here after we denied the cleaning crew! But they were sweet because they insisted we get new towels and more rolls of toilet paper. They let us know that if we needed anything to call them and they'd send whatever we need needed! 5 stars for house keeping! Thank you for making sure the rooms are clean!!

The only thing that bugged me is the fact that they removed their pirate show and they lack in theme!!! Their casino area feels like I'm back in the 90's gambling era! And their elevators make you feel claustrophobic!!!

I reserved a room for our week in Vegas over a month in advance directly through TI. At the time of booking I chose to pay extra for a king deluxe room rather than ""run of the house"" because my fiance wanted a king deluxe room. When we arrived at TI at about 2 am we were told we were being given a 2 queen room. I told the lady that I had reserved a king deluxe room and infact payed extra for it. She said that we had reserved as ""run of the house"" and a 2 queen room was all that was available. I presented a printed copy of my reservation that clearly stated king deluxe at which time she said (in a tone that I would not expect from anyone in the customer service industry) ""that is just a request, you are not guaranteed any type of room, it says so if you read the terms and conditions."" That's right, at Treasure island you get the opportunity to pay extra to make a request, what a bargain!!! She also told us to call down between 11 and 1 the next day for a room change and they would try to accommodate us. The queen room was less than desirable to say the least. It was ""cleanish"" but the shower looked like something out of a nursing home and the bed was on the hard side. The next day we planned on visiting the Grand canyon, but being that we had to hang around until 11 for a room change those plans were postponed. The next day we did get our room change and the kind deluxe room was decent and clean. The bottom line is I feel ripped off having paid for an upgraded room and not having it available when I arrived. Aside from the room, the rest of TI was probably 2.5-3 stars. The buffet was better at the Golden Nugget and Aria and both comparably priced. The seafood shack sucked, no other way to put it. The omelets at the coffee shop were about $20 and was about the same quality as I'd find around home for $8. The bars in the casino were priced on the high side compared to other casinos and the drinks were what you would expect from an amateur bartender. The pool area was decent but don't expect to swim. It's pretty small and shallow.The bottom line is this, as a hotel and restraint TI is on the ""never again list.""

I can tolerate smoke in Vegas. I really can. I go to every casino and breathe it in and don't particularly mind. But this place is smokey. Smokey to the point that my lungs were burning after I stayed in for two hours. If it weren't for some freeplay for signups that lured me in, I wouldn't have stayed.

I had fond memories of this hotel. The memories were spending time in a really larger arcade area and winning tickets. The arcade was removed in 2003 and replaced with more adult themed attractions. Still, a part of me inside wishes that the sign to the video arcade pointed to where that old ticket madness inducing attraction, rather than leading to the dismal six aging video game machines stashed away in an unimportant room.

This place is an absolute nightmare.  Checked in, didn't get into my bed until 2am.  I had 2 beds and a guest that was sleeping in one of the beds.  I unfolded the sheets and saw a small red stain and puncture hole on the bottom sheet (i.e., the one I was going to lay on).  It looked like blood and, based on the tinge, likely fresh.  Horrified and tired, I shared the other bed.  A picture of this stain is attached.

The next morning I went to the front desk and had an incredibly tough time finding someone to help me.  I first waited in the main line at the front desk and, after several minutes was told that they couldn't help me and to see guest services.  I waited at guest services for 10 minutes and then was told there was a special ""managers"" line.  I waited in that line for 15 minutes.

When I finally reached the desk, ""manager"" Justin T. greeted me.  I explained my situation to him.  At first he was obstinate and insisted on an explanation from me for why I did not immediately bring it to the  hotel's attention.  Apparently my explanation for being ""very tired"" is not enough.  Perhaps TI does not often cater to business-oriented customers.  After having to defend my decision, Justin said that they would look into it and call me.  I went back to my room for about half an hour and then down to the casino floor where I waited with my phone and lost a few bucks at the tables.

I went up to my room and saw that the sheets were changed.  I called the front desk and was transferred to Justin T.  He told me that there was no stain, that room service had come up and inspected it.  I said that they must have been mistaken and that he should have called me.  He told me that I was supposed to wait in the room for room service.  First, this is completely fabricated because he never said this to me.  Second, I was in my room and, after that, available on my phone.  Justin even told me that I was supposed to wait ""an hour"" for someone to come to my room, compounding the lie.

I was offered nothing for this horrible experience.  In fact, I was treated with absolute hostility and disrespect.  I didn't ask for anything, I wasn't rude, and I was genuinely trying to get someone's attention about this health issue at the hotel.  They ignored me and told me there was no one else I could complain to.  Apparently Justin T was the last word on the subject.  Disgusting hotel, even more disgusting managers.  What absolute pigs these people are.

Treasure Island has now had an opportunity to explain itself but has not even apologized for this horrific experience.  They have not even acknowledged my email.

In my life I have stayed at hotels as luxurious as the Waldorf-Astoria in NYC or the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, and have also stayed in sleazy, gross motels that I am not comfortable even entering much less sleeping in.  Treasure Island, I am sorry to say, falls into this latter category.  You're better off at a Motel 6 for cleanliness.

This is like getting food poisoning from bad fish at a restaurant and them offering you free desert if you buy the fish again!

I've stayed at the TI at least four times in two years, and my satisfaction has only grown.  Mind you, all of these times have been for work, going to nasty conventions, so that colors my opinion, and means my needs are likely very different than the ""what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas"" crowd.

As a business traveler in a city geared towards anything but seriousness, I appreciate the TI's approachability.  I can be out of my cab, skirt the casino, and be in my room in well under five minutes, something no other large hotel in Vegas can offer.  I've never had anything but polite, helpful and quick service at check in, and luckily, I've been able to get a room no matter what time I check in.

Other pluses for me:  Super clean rooms.  Extremely comfortable bedding.  Big tub.  Makeup mirror (the best invention of the 20th century).  When the toilet exploded (I have infamously bad luck with plumbing, it literally just exploded on its own), I had maintenance there in two minutes, and they were polite and professional.  Pho restaurant is delicious.  Social House, while insanely expensive, is very good.

Minuses:  Pirate show is huge, heaping pile of sh*t.  Very little fine dining options.  Very little fast food either (like a good coffee stand).  Bars are small and not welcoming.  Gaming is lackluster.

I know nothing about the nightclub, show, or pool.

All in all, the TI is not much of a destination hotel, but a very good place to stay, either for business or just as a quiet place to chill between party hoping.  Ask for a room facing the Mirage, and you'll have something cool to watch at night.  Avoid rooms facing the mountains (described as scenic, of course), unless you like staring at Elvis-o-rama.",1,0,1

I dont agree with the 20 ""resort fee"" since we didnt use the pool or any other amenity. My one problem with the room was that there was no mini fridge! That sucked because usually whenever we travel we like to buy stuff from the stores and keep it in our fridge or bring back leftovers and we couldnt in this room. Would I stay again?

Best bang for your buck so to speak. That was then. This is now. This hotel had pretty much everything back then. A decent club (tangerine) back then. Social house. Clean rooms. And pretty good gaming if you ask me. At reasonable rates. To top it off it sits right on the strip. Even the pirate show was worth watching.

Now all of it's gone. Social house, tangerine. Which by the way turned into that gay ed hardy club, which later shut down. Rooms are not very clean. And come on really? gileys salon, give me a break. I last stayed there in late 2010. Which was probably the worst time. They stuck me and a buddy of mine in a smoking room. When we clearly asked for non smoking. They never fixed it. At least it was strip view. Sheets were dirty. Toilet had a hard time flushing. There were dead bugs stuck in the shower lighting fixture. And the water didnt drain properly. also the handle to the faucet kept falling off. The pirate show is a waste of time. But hey it's free. No quality in that. Khotan restaurant which replaced social house, sucks now. 

In all honesty pay the extra 20 or 30 bucks and stay at mirage or Mandalay bay. It's just not the same here anymore. And from the looks of it. Things don't seem to be getting better. Just kinda bothered because this place was great. Now i would rather chance it at flamingo or elsewhere. Also the so called resort fees they tag on to your room bill, are a joke. If your gonna charge me resort fees at least have the place up to par please.",2,2,2

We are not big gamblers so I can't comment on that.  

We went to happy hour at 2 of the 3 bars.  There was line dancing and karaoke at the western bar.  It was fun to watch.  Good appetizers and drinks at the island bar.  We didn't do any shopping within the hotel.

The buffet was just a 3 star, which I assumed it would be.  We got a promotional price on it but it really couldn't be beat.  Afterall, it was just breakfast we went for.  The omelet station was really good. 

In regards to location...I loved it.  There was a Walgreens within walking distance.  But this is seriously better than any I have been to.  They sell liquor and beer, have a fresh fruit station, deli station, etc.  It was great.  And it was easy to walk to a couple of the hotels nearby.

Upon calling security to remove her, it wasn't until about 20 minutes later when we spoke to management that someone came up, took pictures of the incident, took a report, and had medical help sent up. We had to make a stink out of the situation to even get the common courtesy of taking an incident report. Management was EXTREMELY rude and brushed us off. We asked for a complementary dinner since we had to cancel the show we were going to see for my friends bachelorette party. Nothing.

There's ample parking in their garage if you rented a car, but you might as well leave it there. TI's got a good, central location on the Strip, so most things should be within walking distance.

We've stayed here before and based on our previous stays, we made sure to check in early before the weekend rush started. It seems like everyone arrives mid afternoon and registration line becomes super long.  

Our room was immediately available. The room and bathroom were in good order and the bed and linens were crisp and comfy. The air was a bit stuffy however was quickly cooled down by the quiet AC unit. Our room was quiet as we could not hear any of our neighbors, if there were any at all. Elevators got a little crowded as the weekend progress, but that was to be expected. 

We made reservations for a Cabana on Saturday of our stay. The pool area is smaller than some of the the other resorts, so it's a good idea to reserve one so you and your party do not have to fight over pool real estate and chairs. We paid $250 for the cabana however received a $50 credit as part of the ""hotel tax amenity"". The Cabana attendant was very attentive and quick to fulfill our requests. Our pool server was very good as well. It was an added plus that she rocked her ""server outfit"" very well...guys and girls agreed. Her service was speedy and personable and she didn't forget about us. At other resorts, Cabana service is spotty unless you're a VIP or something. Service here was very good, hence, the reason we returned here for a Cabana.

We'll begin the tour of dissatisfaction in the room. The room was riddled with a flickering light in the bathroom, a sink that struggled to drain, and a television remote with a five second delay. Let's not leave out the knocking on the door at eight in the morning. To clarify, no one was knocking. It was just the staff accidentally banging into the door as they mopped the hallway's carpeted floor. In my opinion, though, besides the loss of sleep, room issues don't hold too much significance. How much time do you actually spend awake in a Vegas hotel room? Unfortunately, my discontent with Treasure Island was spread throughout the hotel like a disease. 

Next stop on the tour: the staff and dealers. If you're new to the tables, don't expect the dealers to hold your hand. They could not care less about their players. Should you hit on that 13 with the dealer displaying a 4? Don't ask the dealer for advice because he\/she seems to be playing against you. Not too sure about the odds for the craps payouts? Make sure to study up before you arrive. Don't expect that dealer to remind you to up your place bet on that 6 from ten to twelve dollars in order to receive the correct payout. I'll admit, there were select dealers within the establishment that contradicted these claims, but they were far and few between. Ultimately, Treasure Island disappoints from the player's perspective. It's also the same view from that of the average patron. Poor attitudes seem to be contagious in the establishment. Disappointingly, I can use a single hand to count the number of employees that I observed greet customers with a smile.

I would go as far as describing Treasure Island as a shit-hole (excuse the language). What other term would you use to describe a hotel where you made an afternoon visit to the bathroom - the one located near the Seafood Shack - to find human feces smeared across the toilet seat, walls, and floor of a stall?

I always book my stay for longer than expected because I attend events that COULD last up to 7 days depending on the number of participants that fly out, so most years I check out a day or two early and never have an issue with any of the Harrah's properties.

When we finally did check in we were told we would get complimentary champagne because we were on our honeymoon. Never happened. 

Then housekeeping ""forgot"" to clean our room for 2 days in a row. We had to call each day after our outings when all we wanted to do was relax and then force ourselves to go out for another 3 hours. Everyday we would come back hoping our room was cleaned. 

We went to eat at the Seafood Shack (in house restaurant) and the next day I saw a hold for $250+ when out total was no more then $20. And when we called to figure out WHY they were holding this much no one could give us a straight answer. To this day we still don't know why.

It's conveniently located next to Fashion Show Mall and across from the Venetian which there's a bridge you can cross through. The casino itself was average in size, but it was laid back for a hotel compared to crowded areas like Planet Hollywood. What I like about TI is how they divide up the elevators based on which floor your room is at, which is so much faster and simple. I must agree with other Yelpers that their beds are really comfortable to sleep in. Since my trip was during winter, turning up the heater at its highest wasn't warm enough so I had to call room service for extra blankets. The room was nice and clean, which meets its expectations of a 4 star hotel.

There were some things that disappointed my stay at TI, but I'm sure it could be better for my next stay in the future. We were placed all the way at the end of the floor, but somebody has to stay there, right? So I'm not gonna complain about that since we were placed right next to the Emergency Exit if anything happens. There were no alarm clocks, so we had to rely on looking at our cell phones for the time. Every time we use the sink, there would be some odd smell coming out from it, so it needs some plumbing work. The resort fee is about $22, so we made our money's worth by using the internet. However, the channels are limited to just mainly news channel and some international channels.

I stayed there from July 28-August 1. 5 girls split amongst two conjoining rooms... it was awesome.. we didn't have the best view but we enjoyed it regardless.. could see Encore & Wynn.. and the city.. to us it was most important to have two joining rooms. 

Now we ended up seeing a LOT of hotel rooms on the strip (due to room parties) and I must say the rooms in TI suited us SO well. Our room was always BRIGHT, in the evening there was more than enough light to ensure a bright space. I loved the furnishings, very modern, without trying too hard. The bedding & beds are unbelievably comfortable! The bathroom was nice and big.. enough counter space, and the extra makeup mirror was excellent! There also was enough light and space in the room to set up a second vanity! The size of the room was great, as well, the two beds are well spaced out from each other. 

The room comes with a safe.. it barely fit my macbook (13inch).. this is of concern.. if i had anything bigger i wouldnt have been able to store it. 

The hair dryer was awesome! I have thick long hair and all 5 of us forgot to bring a blowdryer and the in room one worked just fine. Due to the excessive heat we spent a LOT of time in our room, predrinking, getting ready etc. 

As for the hotel itself.. it wasn't too big which is kinda nice... we saw the mystere show (free tickets with room booking) it was AWESOME! i recommend going even if u have to buy your ticket. We ate at Pho.. cheap and filling, as well at the coffee shop.. we just LOVED the cheeseburgers w\/bluecheese of course. We're from Canada.. so we found the restaurants to be extremely cheap! 

The bar @ the casino is pretty good, Dee made us the best tequila shots i've ever had! for a great price too! 5 shots for under $35!!! (i've paid way more at our local bars here in canada!) She was awesome! 

The pool was small... we only checked it out on a Tuesday... not that many people there but felt crowded.. you could over hear others talkin about you and hard to miss the dirty stares.. I cant even imagine what it'd be like on the weekends! There seemed to be more than enough loungers though. 

Location is awesome! We partied @ Tao so it was just a walk over the bridge, as well, across the street at casino royal (?) you can find $1 margaritas (life savers in the heat) andd. don't forget the walgreens! So close! .. TI also connects right to Fashion Show mall (another plus!). We did check out the Ed Hardy club.. looked pretty cool but absolutely dead on Thursday night.. bouncer told us its better on Friday\/Saturday but we had table reservations else where... on that note the staff is pretty good.. have no complaints.

Group demographics: 5 friends 21\/22.. we were on a pretty tight budget...... we didn't want to go super cheap and TI was absolutely perfect for our budget and we got way more than what we paid for.

Check in was a pain. Tried checking in at 2, the line was ridiculous. Played in the casino a little and tried again at 3. The line was not as ridiculous, but I still probably waited at least 30 minutes. The room I requested was available.

The rooms are decent size. They have definetely seen some better days. Some stains on the bathroom counter,bathroom floor and rug. The bed was really comfortable or was it because I was really tired. There was a nice flat screen t.v. in the room. Not sure why none of the Vegas bathrooms that I've been in don't have exhaust fans.

About 7 p.m., I went back to the room to drop some stuff off. There was a bag of garbage, dirty dishes from room service and a comforter in the hallway. Not the sort of thing I expect to see from a four star hotel, especially at 7 p.m.

I hate the resort fee. I thought it was supposed to include 2 for 1 buffet, it did not. I don't know if thats new or they stopped including that in the resort fee.

When we had asked them to change it on a specific day because Ana had been sooo drunk that she was eating apple rings in bed, and fell asleep on one of them and got stuck to the bed. LoL..

I love the fact that they had security before the elevators!

I had actually thrown up at another hotel bathroom after the club, and was walking back to the room with the guy.  I was trying soooo hard to get rid of him, that the only way I could was once I got to the elevator area and asked security NOT to let the guy following me up.

It is not worth the aggravation, discomfort, and outright disgust you will feel during and after your stay. We arrived at 11:30 p.m. on 3\/12\/15. After waiting for a few minutes in line to check in, we were (not) greeted by the most surly, rude man I have ever encountered at a hotel check-in. Although the room had been paid for when I booked it, we still had to pay the ""resort fee"", which is typical of Las Vegas hotels, and a general rip-off, as far as I'm concerned.  My friend asked if the fee could be waived for the first night (of three), as it  was 11:30 p.m. NO was the answer. Period.  

Our room seemed o.k. when we got to it. Certainly nothing special at all. We made it an early night, as we had both been traveling most of the afternoon\/evening. The room had a door to an adjoining room, which was locked. Our neighbors thought it was funny to rattle the doorknob as though they were trying to come in to our room. Not really funny when that is the noise that awakens you in in the middle of the night! The next morning around 9:00 a.m., we went to the front desk and asked to be moved to a room without a door to an adjoining room. We were told to come back by 11:00, so we walked around some of the nearby (fabulous) hotels and then came back. No room ready. Come back at 1:00. Since we received an envelope with two free passes for the lunch or dinner buffet (Monday through Friday only!), we decided we may as well use it for lunch, and then maybe we could move rooms. The dining hall at my daughter's college has more options than this Las Vegas Strip hotel buffet. I believe the price listed for lunch was $24.95. If I had paid that and then experienced the buffet, I would have been really angry.  

Back to the front desk to find out if our room is ready. NOPE, but it will be soon, and they will hold it until 3:00.  How very thoughtful!  Are you kidding me?  We have now spent most of our first day in Las Vegas hanging around this crappy property waiting to be moved to a room where we will be able to sleep and feel safe. What a waste of time. We did finally get a new room without an adjoining door. It had a better view, and I guess that was our bonus, compensation for wasting a good part of our vacation day, as no other compensation or apology was offered.

We hated this hotel so much, from the grocery store bunches of flowers stuck in a vase at reception, to the surly attitude of the front-desk staff, to the run-down feeling of the whole property.

My first bit of advice. Join the players club! Seriously. It's worth it if you ever plan to return to Las Vegas (and who doesn't). The offers keep coming even when you don't visit often. A word to active duty military, give them your drivers license, for some reason they have issues processing a military ID card at the Players Club desk. 

The TI rooms are clean and tidy. As a smoker I prefer a smoking room. It was obvious that they used some kind of chemical to cover up the smoking smell, but since I'm a smoker making the smokey smell I could care less. The bed was super comfy, and the bath tub was huge! We had a lame view this time around, but other visits have put us looking over the pirate show, and other sites of the strip. I'm not too hung up on the view because unless it's a one sided hotel, you're bound to have to look at something, maybe a rooftop now and then.

T.I. fans, please don't hate me for this.

In all honesty, Treasure Island would rank at the lower end of my hotels and resorts preference on The Strip. Why?

First and foremost, unlike the rest of the casinos that give off a pleasing aroma with but a faint whiff of cigarette smoke (Bellagio, Caesar's palace to name a few - Quad is an exception), you are greeted with blast of strong, uninvited smell of a science experiment gone wrong the moment you open those T.I. entrance doors. I remember my mom unable to handle the smell of the casino that she requested I take her out for some fresh air. Vicks Vaporub to the rescue! 

It was almost as if T.I. management intentionally chose the heavy scent to cover up the cigarette smell (which I felt was sticking to the carpets!) only to have them both mix up in all the wrong ways. Arrr! Alright, let's look on the bright side. Maybe it's part of the pirate theme?

Also, parents out there, take heed. The FREE pirate show that plays nightly is NOT for kids. I've seen parents carrying their young toddlers over their shoulders with a hesitant smile one too many times. Expect canon ball blasts, fire shooting out of the walls and suggestive dance movements. Once was really more than enough for me, but I wouldn't stop myself from taking peeps here for a visit. 

Only giving this a 3 because the show is free, or else, I would've stuck with 2.",1,2,0

After approximately 50 minutes I finally made my way to the counter.  The gentleman working the counter was very professional and friendly which made up for the long wait IMO.  I made my way up to my room which was a strip view room on the 22nd floor over looking the pirate ship.  Upon first entering the room I thought ""Hey, this is not so bad"".  I then started to unwind and relax.  I started to notice little things one after another which really built up into me feeling disgusted with the room.  There are blood stains and other unidentifiable stains on the sheets, the bed wasn't made (the blanket was just thrown on top of the messy untucked sheets underneth), a couple of glasses have food stuck to them, the is a large amount of dust all over all surfaces, the carpet has not been vacuumed, trash on the sofa, and more.  If I wanted an unkept room I would have booked a room at a motel on the north side just past the Stratosphere.  I'm in my room writing this and right now I just want to get my night of sleep and get out of here.  Oh, and the resort fee of $22 plus tax is just astronomical!  The MGM Grande is the only hotel of their properties I have stayed at that I have been satisfied with every stay.  It's sad that the room keeping is such a black eye on this hotel.  If it were not for the uncleanliness I would have rated 4 stars.",0,0,0

I'd put my husband in charge of making our Vegas hotel reservations for this single night, and ultimately he chose Treasure Island because of relatively low rates, the Las Vegas Boulevard strip location, and the fact that this hotel-casino hosts Cirque du Soleil's Mystère.  Mystère was great, by the way!

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised.  The value here is pretty darn good.  Was especially pleased by how clean and modern our room was, and staying on the top floor was another nice surprise.

The one thing that really bothered me during our quick stay?  The overly perfume-y (vanilla?) smell throughout the ground floor.  Even the thought of it makes my stomach turn a bit.

Let's not forget that Treasure Island, with its big ship outside, features the ""Sirens of TI"" every night (weather permitting), the first show beginning at 7PM.  The show is mildly racy and incredibly corny but is worth seeing for the cool special effects.  Gosh, I still have one of the cheesy songs in my head over a week later!

Bang for buck, I'm giving Treasure Island 4 stars.  Anything one can't find within this establishment--better casinos, better dining, better shopping--can be found within a couple blocks on the strip.

Sorry, no photos.  It was more important for me to fill my camera's memory card with photos from the National Parks we visited.",11,7,8

When you go to Vegas i don't believe you should spend a lot of time in your Hotel as you're going to be out and about. All you need is a good bed, a good shower, and a safe place to keep your stuff. Maybe a good place to eat. 

Treasure Island has all of this. It's not really a place you want to spend your whole vacation at. But that's ok.

They have the best mattresses, like literally can't compare. Also too the hotel is very nice and clean. There's not a lot to do other than eat and gamble here. But if you're a partier they have 2 bars (senor frogs and saddle ranch) that were always lively. Also the pool area had a concert with Ginuwine when we went.

It is right smack in the middle of everything. It is nestled between the Fashion Show Mall and Mirage, catty-corner to Wynn and across the street from The Venetian. 

The price was okay but for the amenities and quality of the room it should be less expensive but they are charging for location. I also liked that you had to show your card to get into the elevator banks. But it was confusing that they were split into sections depending on the floor you were on.

I was expecting an outdated room since this is an older hotel and it's what we got. The lighting was TERRIBLE! We looked like criminals in all of our selfies. Coupled with the fact that there were maybe two outlets, tops. Half of our stuff was plugged in in the bathroom. The bathroom was roomy but it felt like it was missing something. 

Also, their valet signage is completely wrong! On the day we were leaving we hauled all of our stuff to where the sign was pointing and it turns out it was on the opposite end -_-

Our stay included two complemetary buffet passes. My friend looked it up on Yelp and it had really bad reviews but we decided to go anyway since it was free and we could leave if it looked too sketch. So we went down thinking the passes would be enough but they insisted on seeing my friend's ID so we went up to get it and then the line was even longer and slower.

Bathroom:
Totally new and remodeled tile floor, marble countertops, and beautiful shower. Perfectly clean and inviting.

Then he saw some employees nearby cleaning up broken glass where a fire extinguisher was missing! Then he put it together. SOME IDIOT decided to use fire extinguisher all over our car!!!! F.Y.I....our car was not on fire!!!! They sprayed the car parked next to us too!!! So security came over and ""supposedly wrote a report"", took pictures, blah blah blah and said they would get back to us.

this hotel is sooooo great! first off i must say the beds in my room were beyond comfortable and i didn't wanna leave just wanted to stay in the bed. so for those who are all about ""takin somebody back to the room"" they'll definitely love the bed (comfort-wise that is). nice flat screen tv on the wall, big mirror, and a great view of the strip as well as the excitement of the pirate show!

I highly recommend staying at this hotel especailly if you get a great rate, its got a great location and its connected to fashion show (the mall) right next door, across from the palazzo, and diagonal from the wynn\/encore (all is walking distance). I really enjoyed my stay since i booked way last minute, and the room is quite nice (check the pics!)

Also, i really loved Kahunaville! the band (RTM) was really great and preferred them over the DJ in the Christian Audigier club. 

Club Christian Audigier:
the club is aiiiiight,been here twice and can conclude that the DJ usually sucks. I considered this club to be one of those starter clubs, meaning if you're waiting for the rest of your party to join you or if you wanna get your partying started so you got a good groove goin just walk by one of the promoters in the casino (the only requirement is that you're a woman) they'll give you a writstband for free (blah) drinks before 1 am and free admission all night...

what i'm trying to say is DONT PAY TO GET INTO THIS CLUB! you can easily get in for free and if you're a guy get one of those complimentary passes from the promoters or have one of your girlfriends get it. all in all its a good club but try to leave for another one before its too late and you end up in an unecessary fight. good times...",0,0,0

My recent trip was my second trip to Las Vegas. My first time ever - I stayed at the Encore back in 2009. That room was SUPER spacious and luxe - staying there was dream. The room at TI was nice, but no where near the spaciousness of the Encore. 

I digress.

The rooms at the TI (formerly known as Treasure Island) were nice and clean and I had very little issues with the room. Granted, on our floor - someone was consistently smoking pot, so I'm sure they were having a great time. Thankfully the smoke didn't infiltrate our room. I was a little surprised at the long line for check in on a Friday - around 10pm - it was at least 10-15 people deep. Check-in went smoothly and we even received a free dinner voucher - only problem is was good from monday-friday, so we couldn't use it for the weekend.

The pool was small and packed on saturday. Eh - total pass from my bf and myself.

I do like that TI is centrally located - so we got around via walking half of the weekend.

The hotel is centrally located and the rooms are very nice for the price you pay.  Considering the neighboring hotels are Wynn, Venetian, and Caesars at more than twice the price, TI is a great place to stay if you aren't looking to hang out in the room all that much.  The beds are comfortable and rooms were relatively up to date.  The bathroom is very clean and spacious and made of marble.  However, the maid service could have been a lot more prompt.  I don't gamble so I can't comment on the casino itself.  There is a hot restaurant called Social Club located in the hotel along with a club called Tangerine.  TI only has one pool and it's smaller than most of the large hotels, but there are plenty of lounge chairs.  I saw a lot of families and middle-aged people.  The pool scene was trying to be in the hip side.  Overall, TI is a great value for those looking for a nice hotel room in the middle of things, but not 5 star luxury.",0,0,0

**sorry about the oversight!!  It won't happen again**

Ahem, now that we got that out of the way, I really enjoyed our stay while we were here.  It was a good location, it was right across the street from a Walgreens, which was good for the things you forget!  It was at a good (not great) location on the strip, and it was always easy to get a cab when we needed it!

The check-in and check-out took a really long time, so be forewarned!

I loved the outdoor pool service.  Kahunaville wasn't all that great.  It does have a cool tram that takes you straight to the Mirage which is good when it's cooler and you don't want to venture out at night!

I didn't try the buffet, but my friends said it was just meh.  The little diner in there is overpriced and not great.  Gilly's has a mechanical bull that's pretty cool, but I didn't try any of their food\/beverages.

The pool is totally boring.  They blast music at you which makes it hard to stay in the pool without risking hearing loss.  The DJ is annoying to anyone past the age of 22.  Beyond that the pool just kind of lies there...no waterfalls or anything.  The pool at the cheapo Excalibur at least has water falls and seemed to be a lot bigger. 

Buffet stinks.  Poor service.  Poor food.  But it's two for one with a coupon!

Resort fee.  Everybody does it but nobody should.  Just charge what you're going to charge for the room and leave the resort fees out of it.  You really don't get much for your resort fees that you'll end up using other than things you'd get for free from hotels in any other big city.

Pros:

Reasonably sized rooms.

Food (at Treasure Island): 
Terrible! Trying to get rid of your date? Visit the Pho\/Coffee place downstairs, comes with dragon breath and toxic fart fumes. Then, head back downstairs to Senor Frogs for more partying. The buffet is bland and lacklust but just right for morning hangovers and nursing that mysterious nipple piercing. If you're dying from hunger, there's a CVS on the first floor and the Venetian food court across the street.

Service and Amenities: 
Luckily, our room had awesome ventilation and temperature control. No lingers of stinky pho gas, casino smoke, or stale old lady sheets but there's also no coffee maker or microwave.

I find it good - rooms are clean, nice (I'd say in the 70th percentile of Vegas strip hotels) and a very reasonable value. It is very manageable, in that it's not super huge so it takes 10 minutes just to get from one end to the other. Location is superb. Easy walking access to Venetian\/Palazzo (across the street), Wynn\/Encore (opposite corner), and Fashion Show Mall (across the street). If you have a car, it's easy to access via freeway and getting into the parking lot avoids Las Vegas Blvd. so you don't have to deal with that mess.

I'm a wannabe foodie, so I guess a minor complaint would be I don't find any of their dining options attractive. Canter's isn't bad for a cheap meal. I know they advertise having the only Pho restaurant on the strip but coming from California, I refuse to pay $12+ for a bowl of Pho so I never bothered trying. In terms of fine dining they definitely are lacking. You can probably find better variants of all their food offerings at competing casinos. But that's okay, I don't mind leaving here to grab food. If you like Asian food - this is a great location as well, since you're right on Spring Valley taking you straight up to Chinatown.

Gambling is fairly standard - not a huge casino floor, but has plenty of ways for you to lose your money. One game  I enjoy playing that I haven't seen at TI is BJ Switch though. It seems to be popping up more and more at casinos, so hopefully it will make it's way into TI.

As for the people complaining about the resort fees - everyone else is doing it these days (except Harrah's) so while it sucks, sadly its kind of the norm for Vegas.

For the value and location, four stars from me. Sure I like Wynn\/Venetian\/Cosmo\/Aria\/Bellagio better, but I much rather stay at TI and have more money in my pocket, to lose at the tables!",4,0,0

Our company had booked the Treasure Island hotel.

They had photos of the chapel, nice beige walls with white hydrangea balls hanging on the aisles and two other pretty white arrangements flanking the pulpit.  I wondered if this was only an enticing photo and that none of the flowers would be there unless I purchased them.  They were part of the package.

We chose our own music and vows.  The minister was great.  We chose flowers and boutonnières from them, the unity lighting ceremony and used their in house photographer.

2. both of the irons in BOTH of our rooms were broken. stttrrriiike uno
3. combine that with the tiny flatscreen TVs that look silly compared to all the space next to them? strrrrike deuce equaling -1 star.

5. the view was great, though the windows are situated in weird spots, like half of it is cutoff and it ends into the wall? the connecting rooms basically share a long window so its really awkward... put it in the middle to maximize viewing pleasure? (again, like Kenny L. says, no fresh air.. then again NO HOTELS in vegas have windows that open because PEOPLE JUMP) ..sissy x2
6. theres a ton of different amenities downstairs, restaurants, convenience stores, slots, tables, etc.. but the area i frequent most often is the sports book betting room.. TI's is great, and during other trips where i've stayed at other hotels i've came to TI just to lay down a few stacks on the squad about to ball during the day.
7. room service is trippy.. even having a privacy sign hanging on our front door, they called to check on whether or not we wanted our room serviced. take it how you want, a privacy sign means we don't want service, don't bother us? ...but they double checked? ehh, whatever.. not trippen.

lastly, some girls we knew had a suite upstairs and it was very spacious. a double bathroom, sofas, and they rolled in two pull out beds. they fit a ton of females in there and if they kept it cleaner it would have been SOLID.
if they keep sending us deals, i'll consider it. if not, theres plenty of other hotels on the strip with similar prices that are a lot nicer.

We went to TI to party.  Myself, my husband and our two best friends were in dressed to the nines, walked up to Tangerine and presented our valid Hawaii drivers licenses.  They accepted mine, our two friends, and then refused my husband entry.  Not for any dress code violations, but because they were unsure of his ID.  He presented a second piece of picture ID, from the state of California and he was still refused.

That was the first strike.  The second strike was when we walked over the a bar and sat down.  My hubby and I each put 20 bucks in a video poker machine and ordered drinks.  Our two friends shared a video poker machine with 10 bucks and their drinks were comped.  We paid full price.  As we paid, they refused to take our credit card so we had to walk outside to the expensive ass ATM, with a 5 dollar fee and take cash out to pay for our mediocre drinks.  That was strike 3.

TI has a very good location on the strip, with the Venetian directly across the street, a giant shopping center to the north, and a tram you can take next door to Mirage.

OUR SUITE

When we started planning our tenth wedding anniversary trip we decided to go all out and rent a suite at TI.  

We checked in at about 1:30 and lines were pretty short and check in went fairly quickly.  My only complaint was that because we had booked a suite they charges us an extra $400 deposit that they had failed to tell me about before hand.  I expected to pay a deposit, but $400 creates a bit of sticker shock when you are not ready for it!

Some of the specific amenities we were excited about in our suite were:
Jacuzzi tub
In-room ipod dock
In room non-minibar refrigerator

When we arrived in our room we found that:
the Jacuzzi tub did not work
The ipod dock did not work
the refrigerator did not work

I called down for services and was told they would send up a technician for the refrigerator and the Jacuzzi but that they were phasing out the ipod docks so there was nothing they could do to replace that.  This kind of upset me because as the ipod dock was advertised, we decided we did not need to bring ipod speakers, therefore our ipod, with all of ""our songs"" was useless during our wedding anniversary weekend.

It did not take long before someone came to our room, however he was a security officer, not a technician.  He said he would send the right guy.  After waiting an hour and a half I called back down to the front desk and they sent someone up immediately.  

The jacuzzi was fixed promptly (the GFI switch had kicked off) and he had the refrigerator replaced.

I also noticed that the coffee table and a number of large scrapes and scuffs on the paint under the glass that made it look cheap and second rate.  This would have been something inexpensive and easy to fix but the hotels decision to ignore it tells me a lot about what their priorities are.

Other than that, we really enjoyed our stay.  The space between the hotel entrance and the elevator bank was not excessive as in many casinos.  In fact the elevator banks seemed quite central to just about everything we wanted access to.  Also, there did not seem to be an excessive amount of smoke which is something we always dread about coming to Vegas.

Maid service was very good!

The buffet was good, though I felt over priced given what they served.  

THE POOL\/CABANA

We rented a poolside cabana in Monday.  Though we reserved a cabana ahead of time, I did have to come down at 9 am that day to select the specific one we wanted, but that really didn't bother me.  The cabana comes stocked with soft drinks and water, a fruit plate and four times the number of towels allowed the regular pool patrons.   

Cabana service was prompt, attentive and through.  Drinks and food were served through the Kahunaville Restaurant.  My wife ordered two tropical drinks in plastic souvenir cups, the Vacation and a Melonrita, both of which she said were vary good.  The drinks were $18 a piece which I thought was excessive but not unexpected.  We also ordered the Paradise Sampler which came with jerk chicken, coconut shrimp, ribs, wings, mozzarella triangles (REALLY GOOD!) and nachos.  The presentation was awesome with a ""smoking"" hollowed out coconut (stamped with the old Las Vegas logo) filled with dry ice and water.  Thought the jerk chicken was a bit dry, all and all the food was good and we could not finish it.  The platter was $25 which I consider a bit expensive for a sampler platter, but given the presentation (you get to keep the coconut) and the fact that it was served in a pool side cabana, I am not really sure that my criticism is terribly warranted.

My only real complaint was that it was in excess of 100 degrees that day and for some reason the misters on the cabanas were kept off until almost 3 pm.  Even the wait staff was complaining but nobody seemed to have an answer as to why the delay.  

On a non weekend day the cabana will cost you $180 which initially made my frugal side tense, however my wife pointed out that is you occupy your cabana from open to close, it only runs you about $22 an hour which I don't think is at all unreasonable.",1,0,0

Checking in with 3 people in front of me - really slow!  Although, the person that checked us in was really nice.  The entry is not as grand as the Bellagio or Palazzo, but it was good enough for how old this place is.  We made our way to the 34th floor and right off the elevator, the floor plan is similar if not the same of Mirage.  As we arrived to our room, I held my breath...the room was nice, clean and unexpected.  I think I came in expecting it to be like Planet Hollywood where they nixed all things Alladin, but not really.  There would be old fixture from Alladin mixed in with the new ""hollywood"" memorabilia - doesn't work.
The rooms here are modern, bright and I thought was a very good size room with a king bed, flat screen directly in front of the bed (versus the side of the bed which some say they had) and a view of the strip, Palazzo and Wynn.  This is great because we didn't pay for the strip side.  Large bathroom (they could have done a double-sink) with a tub\/shower combo - deep jacuzzi type tub.  Bed was super comfy (knocked out as soon as you hit the pillow) and the room was smoke free.  The only thing I noticed is that the vent in the bathroom is constantly running, so you can somewhat hear it unless you close the door and I think in the middle of the night I could lightly smell of hint of cigarette smoke, unless it was just my hair that smelled.

We were charged a resort fee of $20 (not sure if it was a one time or every night fee, our bill didn't seem to reflect this - whatever, I can't complain now) which included free wi-fi and the free web tv (the mouse on the web keyboard is no good, too difficult to maneuver), gym facilities and business center type services.  I think this resort fee should really be an option - not everyone will take advantage of this.

I was NOT prepared for all the changes, most for the WORSE.  Let's start with these damn ""resort fees"".  I check in and was immediately dinged with a $159 resort fee.  For this fee I got a daily paper (I read all my news online), the ability to check-in and print your boarding pass (I get all of this from my app), Wi-Fi (It's 2017!  Why are we STILL paying for Wi-Fi??) and that's it since you had to PAY to use their exercise room.  What I'm trying to say is these resort fees are nothing but a money grab.  On to the amenities, mainly the swimming pool.  For a hotel with 3000 (!!!) rooms, that pool was absolutely minuscule!  mid week and the pool was packed, cloudy and reeked of chlorine. So much for a relaxing afternoon poolside, but I tried anyway.  Unsuccessfully.  Most normal hotels would have someone come by while you're at your chair and take your cocktail order.  Not TI.  They only do this for folks that rented either a cabana or if you rented your chair!  Really?


There's a goddamn Senior Frog's in the hotel.  Need I say more??

  Lastly, the food.  Good gawd!  Nothing irks me more than paying tons of $$$ on mediocre to bad food.  And that's all you will find at TI.  $16 mediocre omelets, $15 ok burgers, $26 nasty salads, $20 fish and chips! All ranged from barely ok to awful.  

The few pluses.  Great customer service, strong Wi-Fi, a CVS conveniently located downstairs and very clean and large rooms.  

Seems like the Las Vegas Strip is nothing but a giant parasite designed to suck you dry.  It sucks your money, your mind and even your soul.  But at least you get free alcohol out of it! :p

If you're on a budget this is a great hotel for those who want the North Strip location at a more affordable price. They run really great promotions and you can sometimes get a room for like 50$ (weeknights, of course). That being said, it's just a 3 star hotel. Everything is kind of mediocre - but then, you do have other fancier hotels at your disposal if you're looking for the swank clubs and other things to do.

If the cocktail waitress looks like she jumped straight out of the pages of a magazine, you're bound to be impressed by the quality of the rest of the place's features. If the cocktail waitresses look like a typical Midwestern housewife, run. The Treasure Island cocktail waitresses, and therefore our overall satisfaction with the place, weren't horrible, but definitely not up to par with what you'd expect. 

Every place on the strip has shops that dot their floorplans. Treasure Island featured such lavish shops as: ""Everything's $10 Boutique"" and ""Bling Co"" -- a luxurious jewlery boutique that exclusively showcases items in cubic zirconia. 

Maybe the fact that they permanently house a Cirque du Soleil show, Mystere, would be their saving grace. Oh wait, I forgot that the show orginally debuted in 1993, making it a full 16 years old!

I selected Treasure Island because years ago, it was a favorite spot for my husband and I and is very centrally located.  On recent trips, we have stayed at a lot of the newer casino\/hotels and this time just wanted to regain a little nostalgia.  BAD IDEA.  Found out AFTER we got there that the hotel is no longer an MGM property and hence our player cards were invalid.  The resort fee of $23+ a night is RIDICULOUS.  They give you a list of items that are ""covered"" and to say it is a joke is an understatement.  The fact that wireless internet is included in that list made the fee less painful until we actually tried to use it and had no luck the entire time we stayed.  The front desk told us that availability was ""intermittent"" and they could do nothing about it.  The first night we got in extremely late and immediately found that the main lamp in our room did not work, phone did not work and in the morning, I discovered the hair dryer did not work (albeit in the middle of trying to style my hair).  After we reported these problems, they did fix them however did not feel any compensation was in order.  I will say that the bed\/mattress was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in at any hotel.  Restaurants on the property were way overpriced and below average quality and service.  Gambling was OK but not happy about having to open yet another new player's card on a property that was formerly MGM.  There was also an inequity in the way they establish your player account - my husband's old MGM account was not on file so they gave him several comps for opening a new player account at Treasure Island but because my MGM account was still active in the system, they merely opened a new card for me there and told me I was ineligible for the comps.  Slots VERY tight.  Had a little luck at the tables but we will NEVER return to Treasure Island on future trips to Vegas.  I miss the old Treasure Island and the ""homey"" feel the place used to have.  The clientele is not what it used to be either.  Not upscale at all.  Better deals available all over the strip.",0,0,0

I did not like the check-in process, all a sudden there was some mandatory resort fee that really wasn't properly explained before, and when I expressed concerned, the lady (Katrina I think her name was) got a major attitude with me just because I asked about it. So I gave her a major attitude back the rest of the check-in process. Don't get a flip attitude with me I was just asking for the resort fee to be explained because it wasn't part of my total when I first booked the room.

Other than that, my stay was nice. I didn't have a view of the strip however my view of the west and north sides of the City of Las Vegas with the mountains in the background was awesome so I didn't mind not seeing the strip. They could use a better cable TV selection. For as much as people pay for the rooms I was surprised not to find a lot of popular channels available.

I don't reward nastiness, and I don't care how many customers you deal with who may ask the same question. You chose that job for a reason. The hotel staff needs to be more positive.",2,1,1

Booked a ""special"" on a Tower ""Suite"" for a average of $150+ per night. The ""suite"" was in reality a large room, 1 room, not a suite at all although there were 2 full bathrooms. The room was very old, tired and dated. My view was an overlook of the casino roof.

Room service was decent but pricey. Sausage and eggs with coffee and service charged $32.00. Coffee shop was mediocre, very slow and indifferent service, average food. The Pho ""authentic"" Vietnamese restaurant was nowhere near authentic.

Booked a ticket to the Mystére Cirque du Soleil show. Called from my room and inquired if there were any discounts available for hotel guests, nope, full price.

I was advised to pick up my ticket at 8:30pm for the 9:30pm show. Arrived at 8:15pm and waited in line for 45 minutes to pick up the ticket, one guy working behind the counter, LONG line of show-goers. Picked up the ticket and stepped into the Ben & Jerry's store around the corner for an ice cream, figured 30 minutes was PLENTY of time for that.

I stayed here with a group of friends because some were on a budget and we heard good things about TI, so we decided to give it a try...

The line for checking in was 40 minutes long. It then took 30 minutes to get our three rooms and supposedly... it was an ""upgrade"", which was a huge disappointment when we actually went into the room, and our friend that stayed there before said it is the same as all the other rooms.... what was even worse was that we requested two rooms with two beds and only one room with king bed. We ended up getting two king bed rooms and only one double bed room... So two guy friends had to share a bed because they got tired of everything and didn't want to wait in line again to fix it.

The customer service here varies drastically. I found that my credit card had two pending charges of $244.80 each because of a typo for the resort fee. I went to the front desk to ask someone to help me... and it took 20 minutes before I got to talk to someone. Then the person that was talking to me came up with a bunch of excuses and did not apologize even once. I got sick of him and went upstairs and called the front desk with my phone, hoping to talk to someone else. I finally got a manager... but even the manager did not apologize about the typo that created an extra $400 pending charges.

I was also disappointed because my friends and I wanted to watch the Sirens of TI and it was our last night, and we only had time for the last show.... we went half an hour early to stand in the front... only to be told 5 minutes before the show was about to start that it has been cancelled due to technical difficulties.

I was first introduced to Jeff when my husband (at the time Fiancée) and I were there to check out the rooms and the hotel grounds for our upcoming wedding in June of 2016 (we often travel from California, but have never stayed at TI). Jeff had someone escort us throughout the hotel, pool and to view the vacant array of available rooms from standard to the suites. I booked a standard room before leaving the premises held on the facts of cleanliness and Jeff's hospitality. He set the bar pretty high for my expectations of managers in Vegas- I haven't stayed anywhere else since( mind you, I often stay at the wynn but the over joyed experience doesn't come close to Treasure Island) . He is a genuinely amazing person and is profound at his job. Any-who, the time came just before my wedding and everyone decided to book their rooms, I explained Jeff's exemplary devotion to ease the stress of room bookings for my entire wedding party, family and guests to travel from afar. We got there in a big lump sum and Jeff handled everything himself to ensure that nothing could go wrong! He surprised my husband and I by complimentary upgrading our standard room to a suite.

I liked the casino and the hurricane bar. The buffet is probably the best I have been to. We sat next to the dessert kitchen. Watching the chefs at work was just awesome.

The room was kind of small or seemed that way because the furniture seemed to over power it.

The ugly: Because our first night got comp'd because they didn't have a room, they refunded me my first nights deposit and charged me for the second night, which I thought was stupid because they should have just applied what I'd already paid for the second night.

I immediately called the front desk to let them know and waited around 15 minutes for someone to come take them down. The manager came took a picture and removed them. House keeping came and just changed the curtain so I called and wanted to make sure our tub was cleaned and washed so they sent someone again to wash the tub. I noticed after that the glasses in the restroom and in the room on the table were dirty and had steins on them as if they were not properly washed so we couldn't even use them. When my other guest arrived at night they were told the rooms were over booked and they didn't have any rooms available even though I had paid a big amount on a deposit just to reserve our rooms and make sure all my guest stayed together and there was no hassle going from hotel to hotel. Not only was it my guest but the whole lobby filled with many people who had no room and had paid their deposit as well. Everyone was then sent to Trump hotel.

As soon as you walk in, it's there.

Everyday by like 2:00 the pool would have a murky, creamy hue to it. This is due to people spraying on sunscreen while in the pool, or putting it on and getting right into the pool. Along with, I'm sure...pee. It was gross! I think they should close it for an hour mid-day to zap all the nastiness that is there by the afternoon. We only went in the mornings.

The buffet was just okay. We went during the crab leg night and they were sooo skinny, and had no flavor. They tasted like they were water logged.  The fried foods were soggy, and it seemed like we had gotten there when the food wasn't as fresh. We arrived before the line started forming.

But sometimes (and I'm sure many of you can relate), you end up so knackered that the only safe place for you (and anyone else you might cross paths with) would be the closest entertainment\/distraction to your room (to avoid getting lost) and in this case that would be the casino..

Got swindled by Tix4Tonight into getting buffet tickets 'at a HUGE discount' (according to them) which turned out to be....$3 off.  Er.  Ok, whatever - it's a buffet, they're all the same right? 

Wrong.

The Buffet (as it's known in the casino\/hotel) was small, not very clean and filled with loud people seated too close together.  We saw our server exactly twice.  The food was meh - uninspired, overcooked and cooling rapidly beneath awkwardly spaced bars.  The dessert bar was the only highpoint - it was decently filled with a wide selection of mini & regularly sized sweet things - bread pudding, pies, cakes, donuts, cookies, ice cream & cotton candy.  

The main free 'entertainment' - and I use the term loosely - at Treasure Island is the revamped pirate ship show outside on the Strip called ""Sirens of TI"".  The plot  was non-existent, the music & badly lipsync-ed lyrics were a joke, the choreography executed with lackluster synchronization by the barely dressed-by-Frederick's-of-Hollywood female cast.   The last was possibly the only good thing (for the men) in the audience.   Surely not for the many children attending the show with their irresponsible parents.

I know, when you go from Encore to TI, you may be setting yourself up for disappointment, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Like Kimmy T said, the rooms are updated to be ""sleek and modern"" and while they were considerably smaller than those at the Wynn and Encore, I didn't feel cramped.  The beds are comfy and there's a nice spacious feeling to an otherwise small room.  The bathrooms, however, were on the smaller side and the TV? Well, let's just say you're better off doing something else.  

The casino is a bit on the darker side for me and has this weird air freshener smell.  It was really strong.  It's a little like they were trying a bit too hard to cover up the casino, smoke infested smell.  They do have a nice amount of casual eating options, since in general, they are more open to visitors with families. 

Other than that, for the price, it really is still a good bet.  The internet specials are the way to go, since they offer better deals than the front desk.  Speaking of the front desk, I had to have my room key reactivated, and the line was longer than the one for Space Mountain at Disneyland.  Only at DLand, they at least move fairly quickly.

I think they've changed their focus to have more of an adult, ""sin city"" vibe.  The rooms have been updated to be sleek and modern.  They added the Christian Audigier (Ed Hardy) nightclub and they have a tapas bar (and a few other nice bars).  I like that the casino has a walkway to the Fashion Show mall directly across the street.  And you can also access Wynn and Encore by going across one more walkway and if you cross a 3rd walkway, you're in the Venetian and Palazzo, which are connected.  This is really critical when you're drunk and don't want to drive or deal with traffic or getting your car out of valet.

-- Does the hotel's lobby & exterior look that bad?  No.
-- Are the restaurants & clubs all that bad?  Nah.
-- Are the rooms in that bad a state of disrepair?  Not really.
-- Is the casino all that bad?  Well, yeah.  It is.

Let's start with the gaming.  This is an absolute idiot's casino.  

1) CASINO
Being the cheapest of the 90's generation resorts, I think TI management believes that the people that come through there are easy marks - and they're probably right.  
...The casino is loaded with 6-5 single deck Blackjack (the worst blackjack game in Vegas) and what little isn't, is a lousy 3-2 6-deck CSM DD on 10\/11 only, no DD after splits, split aces once.  And most of it is entry level $5-$15 play, meaning it's amateur hour.  And you know that you're not going to get any decent comps unless you're a solid black chipper because TI is part of the MGM Mirage comp system.

2) PEOPLE
Then there's the clientele.  Boy - where did they get these methheads & geriatric refugees from?  If they're not 80 years old, they're rejects from the Rocky Horror Picture show.  Loud, intoxicated, rude, and very slow... not surprisingly, they're all at the 6-5 single deck blackjack pit watching the casino bleed their chips away like a vampire.  ""What if I don't want that card?  Can I just bet a $1?"" ""Where's that there beer lady at?"" ""What?  Speak up, sonny!""  This is funny enough to watch for a few minutes.

3) SERVICE
And then there's the service.  Someone mentioned this before and I was surprised no one else encountered this:  Housekeeping starts knocking on doors before 8:30AM in the morning!  W.... T..... F.....?  And it seems the maids don't understand the words ""Privacy Please"".  
...We actually made our own sign out of the memo paper in the desk that read, ""No entrada, por favor."" It'd be a funny story if it weren't for the fact that the sign WORKED for the rest of our stay.

I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE:
If you don't believe me that it's a pit, take it from TI's creator:
-- The Wynn's consider this hotel their only mistake.  Elaine Wynn was quoted as saying about the exterior, ""Isn't it awful?""  Steve Wynn is quoted as regretting having built it during the ""family-friendly"" Vegas trend of the 90's. (Read the book ""Winner Takes All"")
-- The fact that Phil Ruffin, former owner of the dreaded New Frontier, picked it up should tell you something.  The Frontier was a rundown, unmaintained, souless hotel & casino.  It also has the distinction of being the last casino that I caught using a card mechanic as a dealer at the blackjack table.

CONCLUSION
It's dark, dingy, and has a lousy casino. They need to nuke this hotel right after they demo Circus Circus, Excalibur, and Imperial Palace.  Being forced to stay there is a crime against humanity but I'll give it +1 for Social House which is a meager strip-based alternative to Nobu, Yellowtail, or Ichiya.

Here are just a few things that I did not like: 

1) Room's cleanliness: Room was very dirty. I found a Revlon makeup container in the bedroom floor. So, it was evident that the housekeepers didn't vacuum. I am a male and I don't use makeup. My wife doesn't use Revlon, so I know it wasn't something that fell out of my suitcase. 

The bathroom was, in their own manager's words, ""disgusting.""  I found lots of hair on the bathroom floor (obviously, no one even attempted to clean this). I also found pubic hairs on the tub and sink.  Let's just sat that I shave and there is no chance that the body hair of any kind was mine.  Several ""clean"" towels had hairs on them, and the hairs were from different people (hairs were red, blond, black, brown, etc.). 

Until this trip, I had never complained at a hotel ever in my entire life. I used to clean bathrooms and gyms as a college student, so I know how tough it is to get the job done in the time allotted. Also, I am a very forgiving person. I don't expect my room to be as clean as an operating room. On Saturday morning, I went to the manager and complained. He listened to me, and expressed his apologies. He also said that the hair in the floor was ""disgusting"" and ""unacceptable."" He offered me a free buffet ticket.  That's it.  A free buffet ticket...wait for it...for two people.  He basically accused me of lying. 

I got the sense that the manager thought I had invited some women into my room because he asked me several times if I was alone (and, I was). I suppose the issue was that I didn't complain shortly after checking in. Well, I basically fell asleep as soon as I got to my room on Friday night and I didn't wake up until Saturday morning. I complained as soon as I noticed the hair. 

Lesson learned: check your room ASAP after entering and report any dissatisfactory conditions immediately. 

The housekeeping manager came to my room later on Saturday and checked on my room. That was a nice gesture and made me feel like they actually cared a little. 

2) Check-in Process: I arrived around 4:00 PM on a Friday. The line to check in was very long, and it took about 30 minutes to get to the desk to check in. 

3) Ambiance: There were a lot of people in the hotel promoting various dinner specials, show specials, etc. I don't want to deal with that inside my hotel. The Strip is one thing, but come on: I don't want chaos inside my hotel. I go inside to get some peace. The hotel's crowd included a lot of country-Western ""macho"" guys, which I can't tolerate being around. I also prefer to be around a little bit higher class of person than was at Treasure Island. I don't like being threatened at a bar for accidentally bumping into someone who was blocking the only walking path in Gilley's bar. 

4) Wi-fi internet not free: It's a little ridiculous that hotels charge for wi-fi. At least it was fast wi-fi.",13,2,0

I had the most horrific experience at the Treasure Island Hotel. Upon returning to our hotel room at Treasure Island after attending a wedding, at approximately 12:30am, a disturbing man was exiting OUR HOTEL ROOM with our bottle of vodka, a black laundry bag full of our valuables, and some sort of keycard. When my friends husband confronted him, the man grabbed him by the neck and pushed him against the wall and tried to escape through the door to the SERVICE ELEVATORS. I felt terrified for our safety and was worried that someone would get more hurt. We did not know if this guy could have a weapon and I trusted that security would jump in and help us stop this man. However when I looked down the hallway to see the security while the man was STILL IN THE HALLWAY AND THE ATTACK WAS TAKING PLACE, the security team was WALKING, not running, but WALKING towards us allowing the man to get away with all of our things. I felt completely unsafe and helpless. This man COULD HAVE BEEN STOPPED had the security team taken a dangerous situation seriously and had its guests best interest at heart. By the time the security team WALKED down the hallway to reach us, the man was gone. They proceeded to try and talk us out of filing a report with the police and said we can just file a report with the hotel ""IF WE WANTED TO"". The next morning, we went to the front desk to try and be compensated for our room and there was no note of the incident that had been recorded on our reservation. SKETCHY!! They refused to reimburse anything but resort fees at $24.99\/night. When my friend claimed that this was unacceptable, the on duty manager, Christopher Sheehan, threatened to call security and have her kicked out of the hotel for raising her voice in front of guests. People have the right to know how UNSAFE Treasure Island Hotel is and how poorly they treat their guests, as well as the lack of communication, action, and seriousness of dangerous situations.

The room was very modern and clean. I heard they just renovated recently so I guess that's why. Marble counter tops and black wood. Very nice. The bed, sheets, and pillows were comfy and clean. I was sooooooooo comfortable!!! 

However, what annoyed me was the 12% resort fee, which I heard not all hotels charge. So, it didn't seem like it was thaaaat cheap. Plus, no free wifi. But hey, a nice looking room for under $100 in Vegas, can't beat that.

I remember watching the pirates show outside of Treasure Island when I was younger. Canons, ARrrrrRg Matey, etc.

Room 12069 was ready to party, our neighbors in the room next door were not. 

The last time I stayed in a hotel in Vegas was probably Circus Circus, which was a LONNNNNNNNNNNG time ago, so I have nothing to compare this trip to Vegas to.

We had a view of the Fashion Show Mall.

Christian Audigier The Nightclub? SRSLY? I was not ready for a fist pumping good time.

However, good times were spent at the pool, we were about to get lounge chairs near each other, 3 and 3.
Mango Margarita and Strawberry Margarita, delicious. Shots in a test tube. Yes, please. 

My friend who had misplaced his phone was able to find it at the towel\/cabana rental station. Good peeps.

I'd skip out on ""The Coffeeshop"" and the ONLY vietnamese cuisine on the strip! (A pho place)

What supposed to be a perfect romantic weekend turned out to be disappointing.

I found a deal to stay two nights in a single King bed at a great price with an option to become a ""MyTI Member"" and receive Free Buffet every day. So I signed up and received the confirmation email.

We arrived to the hotel around 11:00pm after staying in traffic for almost 6 hours from Los Angeles (not their problem) but when we arrived, we waited in line for an hour at check in. I noticed that some customers where complaining to the staff, not sure why, but I was able to figure it out when it was our turn to check-in. 

The lady who helped us (unfortunately I dont have her name) told me that they didnt have the room that I paid for and that we will be on a two queen beds. I complained and asked her to double check the availability and her attitude turned to be a little rude by that point. She said that she can ""try"" to hold a room for me for the following day.

Then I mentioned to her about the ""Free buffet"" and she told me that such offer does not exist.  At that point and showed her a print out and she was shocked I had a paper proving it. She then told me that there was nothing she can do about it. I asked her why and I was not given an  explanation and she asked me to come back the next day because the Manager isthe only one who can help me and he is available between 7am and 5pm.

Next day I showed up at the front desk around 8am and talked to Jessica. She was very courteous at first. I explained to her my situation and she said that the computer was showing that a room with King bed was on hold for me but I have to wait until 11am for it to be available. I called at 11:15, then at 12:30, 2:00 and the room was not ready. Finally when I showed up at front desk at 3:00pm they handed me the new keys for the right room.

In regards to the buffet tickets she said that they dont have such a promotion and I showed her the print out. At that moment she mentioned that some customers complaind about it as well and that she doesnt know why the promotion is showing on the website and not on the booking system. I asked her to talk to the manager. She went a talked to someone and came back saying that the only thing that they can do is hand me some ""special coupons"" for the inconvenience (2 for 1 cocktails, $25 off future stay, $12.50 for unlimited drinks, $7 apetizer coupon and $2 off any sandwich)

I told her that I wanted to talk to the manager because I felt the offer has to be honored because it was a mistake on your part, not my issue. She said he was very busy and could not come to talk to me. Then she went a talk to someone and came back offering me a ""2 for 1 dinner coupon"" as a courtesy, trying to make me think she was doing a big favor for me. 

At that point I asked her for an upgrade as a courtesy and\/or compensation for having the wrong room the night before and she said they cant do it because of the long weekend. At that point I decided to give up and take the coupon as I wasted almost an hour.

I have to say that the rooms are spacious, nicely decorated, comfortable and clean. The pool, the show and the gambling area are great, but Im very disappointed by the quality of service being given to your customers.

Everything about this hotel was a great experience, except the TI Sirens Show which has horrible story line, horrible acting, horrible all together; one this it was, funny and tacky, but I still left. The reason why I knocked it a star. 

The room was a normal sized room. It was still cleaner than average. Amenities were nice.. flat screen television, and an iPod dock. We had a view of the pool area.. which was nice. Our friends who joined us had a room right across, and got the view of the strip. I was kinda jealous- but we barely stayed in.

The pool was great. Fun in the sun with a DJ. I bought out some guacamole,chips and salsa from the Latin restaurant inside.. accompanied with a drink from the adjecent bar. Very relaxing at the same time.

I ate at their pizza joint.. but usually when visiting Las Vegas and I am on that end of the strip, I just go to Chinatown to get crab fried rice.. it's no further than 2-3 miles away.

I love the pirate vibe, it's different than the swanky upscale hotels that are popping up on the strip. Another reason I loved staying here is that it is close to all the shopping.. like literally walking distance to the mall and the other hotels with shopping venues.

One of the other hotels I recommend for a budget. It's not as pricey as the newer hotels.. but not as cheapy and dirty as lets say, Imperial Palace.",2,0,1

The accommodations at this establishment were some of the most horrid that I've ever experienced. So much so, I checked out after two days and moved to Encore . Simply put, it was far below my expectations for the Vegas Strip.  First, the décor was a touch outdated and seasoned to put it gently. To give perspective to the rooms, one would compare the accommodations to a Hampton Inn outside of a major Midwest city. 

The run down is as follows:

The water never got quite hot.

This establishment deploys a sensor (motion\/body-heat\/whatever) thermostat to determine if someone is in the room. However, if one is sleep then little-to-no movement in sensed thus the thermostat will not kick on to cool the room. As a result, it felt like a muggy summer's day in NOLA. 

The room smelled of smoke (it was faint but there)

The ironing board was broken

The television had poor volume control. When turned on it would blare so loudly it could startle you. 

The noise level was atrocious...
     Although TI can't do much about its patrons, perhaps installing doors that don't slam shut will improve the overall experience for all guest.

     Did you know there is a flight path right over the strip? Exactly, I didn't either until I stayed in this hotel. It may be difficult to change flight paths but installing windows to block out the sound of a jet flying overhead will help tremendously. Quite frankly their competitors across the street (I stayed at them all) solved this problem. 

     I like to party as much as the next guy. After ""going hard"" during a night or day in Vegas, one needs to sleep off the after affects. The DJ at the pool is nice but kept me up while I was trying to recover in time for round two.

The pool was small and lacked limes to make the drinks I wanted. Although the bar tenders dudes behind the bar were cool and funny.

The pool's bar maids\/waitresses didn't seem very interested in their job. Most spent time in the back and rarely brought out drinks or even engaged the customers.",3,0,0

Pros:

-Waived our $20\/day resort fee which was a nice plus.  (more $$ for booze)

-Drink vouchers at their Breeze Bar.  (Free booze!)

-Upgrade to higher upper room with strip view and their Sirens show.  (fireworks heighten your mood while boozing it up in your room)

-Christian Audigier club with free entry and open bar until 1am.  (Yum, more free booze!)

-Canter's Deli & Pho at the Coffeeshop (after booze munchies)

-Prime location!  Center strip across from Wynn, Encore, Venetian, Palazzo and adjacent to Mirage and shopping mall.  (walking distance to all the hot clubs when you're too boozed up to drive)

-Super comfy beds and clean, modern amenities.  (for after boozing)

Cons:

-Yes, check in time was about an hour.  They are having difficulty with their new computer system so just be understanding and patient.  Your stripper girlfriend LexXxxie will still be at S Rhino waiting for you, I promise.

-Steep prices at their hotel restaurants.  $15 for pho, but heck, it was worth it both mornings when I woke up with a throbbing head.  All you fools who keep complaining, c'mon, you're in Vegas.  Live a little.  Quit being stingy mofos or make the drive out to Chinatown if you must and shuddap!  You pay for convenience ummmk?

Once part of the MGM\/Mirage empire, it's now independently owned.  This is bad if you're a member of the MGM\/Mirage family and want to earn comps that you can transfer between resorts; TI is it's own thing now.  But... I oddly just have more fun playing the tables here than at other resorts. It comes down to the people.  The dealers are personable and funny.  Table games -- same odds and expectations as the other resorts, but see if they have better Craps odds or single-deck during the day.  Slots -- always been pretty tight since they broke away from MGM\/Mirage.  But honestly, they have good slot games, so I find myself having fun even though I don't win as much.  Bottom line:  If you're on a budget, don't expect to win a lot off of slots, but they have a decent variety.

TI peddles lots of coupons, especially to Kahunaville, their Pan-American restaurant.  In the old days, it was great, with ""dancing"" water\/light shows, but I find that they sometimes restrict access to the main dining hall due to lack of patrons, and they shove you into the bar.  Once, I found they even blocked the water show in the dining hall with a giant projector screen for a sports event.  Sad, but I realize tourism is down in Vegas.  But the food is pretty good.

Tip:  Right across the street from a major 3-story Fashion Show Mall, and they have an escalator and walkway to get you there.  

Tip:  There's a quick tram that will take you to the Mirage, but verify its hours if you're going to the Mirage for a late night show.  

Tip:  To get to Caesar's or Harrah's easily:  take the Tram to the Mirage, enter Mirage, going south through the casino past the deli and burger places, out the glass doors by the tigers, which will dump you off at a corner where you can cross the street to Harrah's or Caesar's in the other direction.  This bypasses a lot of the street walking.

Tip: Because Gilley's is a major cowboy bar there, check the Las Vegas Convention Center website (vegas.com) and look up the various conventions held in the area.  Try to avoid staying during rodeo season if you don't like crowds.

Tip:  Parking Structure - Try to park on Level 3, which will lead you straight into the casino level without having to use elevators.  There's an interior escalator that will drop you down to the casino level where the hotel elevators are.  Otherwise you have to take garage elevators to Level 3.

Tip:  Arriving by car - consider pulling up front and having your car put in valet.  It's a trek from the parking structure to the hotel elevators, so I usually arrive and valet, having my bags sent to my room.  Then later retrieve my car to drive around town, but eventually park in the structure.  When I check out, I'll usually make a trek to the parking garage, but this limits it to one time.  FYI... the valets rock, so tip them well, as with your baggage person.

Tip:  Yeah, they have the free pirate show, but it sucks compared to the original. It's all ""smexy"" now and dumbed down for the foreigners. Keep this in mind, as there is always a rush into the casino area after each show.",4,0,2

We had requested adjoining rooms and at the time we made the reservation they said ok but then when we checked in it was a no.  The desk agent actually suggested that we could downgrade our room if we wanted to.  Downgrade?!  What hotel fails to uphold a request and then offers you a downgrade?  We decided to stick with the deluxe room, all of which are located on the ""penthouse floor.""   The rooms are no bigger in size, they just have vaulted ceilings and to be honest, I would have preferred the extra floor\/room space.  The room we were in was on the backside of the building overlooking the highway, some adult stores, and the back of the Fashion Show Mall.   There was a freight train would pass through twice every morning along with periodic police sirens.  Stellar.   The room is basic.  There is no mini bar or any of those types of amenities.  One morning the handle of the faucet came off in my husband's hand.  The light in the closet never shut off because we could never get the doors to close completely.  However the bed was comfortable and that is very important in Vegas!

As far as the rest of the hotel goes, its standard.  Coffee shop, buffet, lounge, nightclub.  None of these things are particularly remarkable.  It is small so its easy to navigate and the theme is well carried.  There was a variety of guests staying there that weekend from families to young partiers.   I couldn't take the easy listening music they were constantly piping through the place either.

I had wondered why we had to pay cash or show my credit card for payments. The next day, they had informed me I had declined room charging, which was funny, I had never been asked! Well after that was taken care of by a very quiet and shy, yet attentive Christian, (I believe his name was), we were set! Then I realized I had forgotten to print the Mariah tickets...oops!

I liked the pool, and the DJ that was there every day was good. Maybe because it's so cheap, Treasure Island seems to attract a younger, trendier crowd than a lot of Vegas hotels, so that was nice. In most parts of the world you have to pay good money to watch young women in bikinis dancing like that.

Cons: As mentioned above, they shove a $28\/room ""resort fee"" on you when you go to check in (it's hidden in the small print when you book the room). For three rooms for three nights, this amounted to quite a substantial unexpected fee. The rooms are nice enough, but don't have fridges or coffee-making facilities. Also, the internet in the rooms was pretty terrible. We never got wi-fi working in our room, and the tech guy wasn't allowed to come into the room when we weren't there, so we ended up using wired internet rather than spend our vacation waiting in a room for tech support to show up. Another person in our party was 2 rooms down and his internet worked about 50% of the time we were there.

My boyfriend and I stayed here (6\/19-25\/14) for EDC week and our 3 year anniversary. This is a really nice hotel, it was up to date and every one was really nice. On our check-in date, we already had purchased an early check-in when we booked our room online. The lady in the lobby was directing us where to go and there was barely any people yet since it was only around 11am. The woman who helped us check-in was really nice! I forgot her name though. We were aware of the resort fees already, so we didn't really have anything to say. It was $25\/night which costed us around $125.... it did suck though because the wifi did NOT work for us at all.

Anyways, we walked towards the elevators and there were 2 men checking for room keys which felt very safe. Our room was on the 33rd non-smoking floor. Our room was really nice and cute. The bathroom had essentials of shampoo\/conditioner\/lotion\/cotton pads\/Q-tips- which all smelled really good! I believe it's products from their spa ""Oleksandra"". Although it didn't include a coffee maker, there is a small refrigerator in the closet (which we totally didn't even know about until the last few days of our trip!!! -_-)

The bed was incredibly comfy, as well as the pillows. House keeping was really nice and let us have more pillows and blankets because 2 of our friends also stayed with us. We thought about getting a rollaway bed, but they didn't mind sleeping on the floor since this room was a bit tight of space. The TV sucked. Yes it did. Majority of the time there was ALOT of infomercials and the signal just sucked. It was always static-y and you couldn't hear the show most of the time. I mean, you don't go to Vegas to watch TV in your hotel room, but the times when you wanna relax, the TV doesn't even work...

Other than that, we did get a strip view room and it was beautiful. We got to see the Mirage volcano show from our window. Room service was also good. Our first time, we ordered an American breakfast from their menu and it was really good. The second time, we ordered pho from the restaurant downstairs and had it delivered to our room. But that second time, whoever was on the phone was being really rude. Besides that, the food was really good.

This hotel's location is very convenient too! It's kind of far from all the action on the strip (i.e. Planet Hollywood) but it was nice for a change of hotels. There is a 24 hour Starbucks outside and Walgreens across the street. The freeway is also very close too! This was good since we had to drive to the LVMS that weekend. The Fashion Show mall is also very close, which had a great food court. Walking the strip from this hotel isn't too bad, since you can always cut into the casinos that have air conditioning.",7,1,1

For a mere $80\/night (although you also have to dish out an annoying and rather pointless $25\/night resort fee), you can plant yourself near the heart of the Strip, right within walking distance of The Venetian, The Palazzo, and Mirage (there's also a tram that runs b\/w TI and Mirage), and a 2min drive away from Monte Cristo, Caesar's Palace, The Bellagio, and other prominent Vegas hotels. My boyfriend and I spent two nights here: our room was nice and clean and modern-looking (thank God!), we had a great view of the pool and Strip, and we were extremely pleased with our stay.

* Food Options: The Buffet (nothing special. Luckily, we were given a 2-for-1 coupon at check-in), Coffee House (breakfast, brunch, lunch), Pho (Vietnamese cuisine), Gilly's Saloon (BBQ), Señor Frogs, Phil's Italian Steakhouse, Pizzeria Francesco's, etc...

* Show Options: Cirque du Soleil's ""Mystere"" - didn't see it. TI's outdoor ""Sirens"" show: 20min show with pirates and scantily-clad, singing and dancing sirens. Kind of tacky, but whatever, it's free.

* Nightlife & Casino: Kahunaville Bar, Gilly's Saloon (complete with mechanical bull riding), Señor Frogs, random bars. Casino was well-managed, big, and enjoyable. I had slot machines galore and my boyfriend was content at his poker tables.

The only thing TI's missing is a good lounge or club, as the ones it has leave a lot to be desired. After hearing about clubs like XS, Marquee, and LAVO, and coming back from partying at the Wynn's Tryst, even thinking about finishing the night in a rainforest-esque place like Kahunaville was a definite turn-off.

We used the buffet that evening, we charged meals to our room, we called the front desk for several requests such as linens and towels, all normal things. On Sunday evening my wifes door key card did not work. The hotel decided that my wife's name was not included in our room. They denied her access which included her blood pressure medicine and inhaler puff, both critical. She had all her personal belongings, clothing Etc in the room. Unfortunately my phone was dead although Noone from the hotel ever tried to call me. Apparently with all rooms full on the strip she was forced to get a room fairly far away from Treasure Island. This caused a huge amount of suffering. I was actually in the room when security told my wife the room was empty. I woke up at 5 a.m. to find her not next to me, this was not normal. I proceeded to the front desk which did not have any information of the incident. I could not reach my wife. I later found out she turned her phone off since it was getting low and she needed to save it for the morning (her charger was also in our room).

CHECK-IN\/FRONT DESK - 4 Stars
Overall the front desk staff is very friendly and the check-in process is quite quick.  They have one large queue line that zig zags throughout the check-in\/lobby area, which I like better than the individual lines for each front desk clerk that some hotels have.  For some reason it makes things go quicker, and you won't see someone further back in the line next to you check-in before you.

HOTEL ROOM - 4 Stars
The rooms I've stayed in before seemed very clean, modern, warm and welcoming.  The standard rooms also come with a decent sized LCD (plasma?) TV, safe, ironing board, desk, and a nice sitting chair by the window.

CASINO - 3 Stars
I do like to gamble at TI now and then, but for some reason the theme\/decor of the casino itself does not call out to me.  I preferably would like to play next door at The Mirage or down the street at Harrah's or Bally's.  The casino staff is nice and friendly though, and always willing to help you brush up on your skills at the game, or learn the game if you're a new player.

DINING - 4 Stars
TI offers a wide assortment of dining.  While some of them are not my favorite,I absolutely love the Coffee Shop and the Buffet.  While the Coffee Shop may seem pricey, I guarantee you will not leave their hungry.  They give you decent servings, especially the fried chicken meal and the spaghetti w\/ meatballs meal.  The Buffet at TI is also really good.  Prices are par for it's neighbors (Mirage, Venetian, Caesars, etc), but personally I think the food quality and service are just a tad bit better than the rest.

BARS -  3 Stars  
This is the area where TI needs to step it up a notch.  Granted they have Gilley's, but there are also plenty of other chain country bars on the strip (such as Toby Kieth's at Harrah's).  And while Senior Frogs has a great view of Sirens Cove and the Strip, I think something custom to TI would make the experience a whole lot better.  Oddly, out of all the bar selections at TI, my favorite is Breeze Bar, smack dab in the middle of the casino.  I would rate this one 5 stars on it's own.  Great atmosphere, decent drink prices, friendly staff, and did I mention it's right in the middle of the casino?  Perfect spot to people watch and have a few drinks.

SPORTS BOOK -  4 Stars  
While not my favorite sports book in Vegas, TI has a pretty nice one.  As always, the staff is very friendly, and willing to help you understand anything and everything about sports betting if you have questions (they just won't make recommendations on who to wager for\/against).  This SB is also pretty clean and the cocktail waitresses seem to come around more often than at other SB's in Vegas.

I read that another recent reviewer found that there wasn't a hairdryer in her room & I don't blame her because I had to actually search for mine & I found it in the closet .. the top of the closet.  & being a short person, I did NOT appreciate that at all.

We arrived at TI late on a weekday evening and after a painfully long check-in, we were given an upgraded room (I think they may have overbooked ours). 

The upgraded room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. But the bathroom condition left much to be desired. The shower had obvious mold in the grout and the water would NOT drain quickly enough. We had to turn the water completely off every 2 minutes in order to allow the water to drain so we weren't standing in dirty water. 

The bar soap was generic and extremely drying and left a film on the skin and in the sink. We used our own toiletries the rest of our stay.

The other issue was the fridge that was kept in the closet in the bathroom. We didn't even realize it was there until the night before we checked out. We could have really used it had we known it was there.

The wifi was quite good, though I had to re-enter my credentials a couple times to get it going during my stay.

The pool area is basic and clean. Lounge chairs get snapped up quickly. Pool staff need to make rounds and collect towels off the chairs so other guests can use them (guests should be courteous enough to pick their towels off the lounge chairs when they leave but it doesn't always happen).

The pool bar staff come around the pool and take orders but don't pick up the signed bill quickly. I had to exit the pool hand deliver it to the bar area because it had been so long.

The guest service desk was very courteous. Our resort fees allow us 10 printouts and so I went down to print out our show tickets and had no trouble. 

Check-out at the desk was quick. Told them about our drain issue and they said they'd let housekeeping know. I got the feeling they were just waving it off, I don't even think they made a note of it. I feel bad for the next guest that gets that room.

We'll probably just stay suck it up and pay for parking and stay at one of the nicer hotels next time. TI is ok if you're on a budget and don't mind some housekeeping issues. And the exterior of the hotel could use a makeover.",10,4,4

We were there from Monday-Friday and I am glad we avoided the weekend craziness.  Inside, Treasure Island is much more forgettable than other hotels.  It is definitely not as fun to look at.  Our hotel suite had 2 bathrooms and one of the bathrooms had a huge jet tub.  The room wasn't massive but it was a good size for two people.  

On the first night they put us on the 4th floor and when I called to see if we could be switched to a higher floor they were really nice about it and said they could for Tues-Thurs, just not that night.  So on Tuesday night we were switched to the 23rd floor and that had a much better view.  

I really liked the gym.  It is inside the spa area and can get crowded but they have tons of machines.

For those who say this place needs work...not so much, in fact the people I talked with at the pool agreed with me, they were all satisfied staying here.  

As for the pool, it is on the small side for such a large hotel...Saturday we stepped out there at noon and it was beyond packed - mostly with people reserving their chairs with towels and in the pool.  There is a DJ at the pool that starts around noon-ish.  We got an earlier start on Sunday and it wasn't so packed just because people tend to go home that day.  The DJ played a variety of music, I didn't even need my ipod out there.

The location is great - you can walk or take the tram over to the Mirage for free, it's right across the street from The Venentian.

I'm rating these hotel in Las Vegas 5 Stars!!! For some reason while my stay at Circus Circus I had no type of luck whatsoever. I played and played slots and never won. But as I decided to take my family to eat at Senor frogs restaurant in this casino every machine I played at was a $100 win and I played at like 5 different ones with just $10.. That's $450 profit in just minutes.. so I enjoyed our lunch even more right after..
Later that night I decided to go back to the bar and get really drunk. What a pretty fun place to be ( by the bar) and by the black jack table.. I won like $600 mostly every hand.. I even played $100 every hand at a point and doubled real quick with a win. 
Overall I'm happy with this hotel casino. I'm most likely booking my next stay here for sure!!!

I know they have tried to modernize the place and draw in a younger crowd
I am not sure how that is going for them, but I think it was really a nice hotel when owned by Steve Wynn and then MGM\/Mirage

not sure if new ownership is taking in the right direction, but hey, its their hotel to do as they wish right?  Miss the pirate themed battle out front too....

The rooms are nice enough but housekeeping is horrible. They ignore the do not disturb signs and miss basic things like emptying the trash or picking up things on the floor. I feel like a fool for leaving a tip for them the first few days. 

The pool is small but OK however there is a good reason the cabanas cost half as much as other hotels. The service is horrible. We watched our waitress sit and flirt with a group of guys while we waited an hour for a round of drinks.

We mainly only booked this hotel because it was one of the few whose pool was already open for the season, and the rates were reasonable considering the PAC 12 Basketball Tournament was being hosted at MGM. 

Our first night, check in went smoothly and we were able to check in an hour early, we went up to the room and headed for the pool. First thing; they don't allow outside food and drink at the pool, not even water, you have to buy everything inside at their ridiculous rate. The old crotchety guy checking room keys and bags couldn't have been ruder. So we returned to the room to ditch our water bottles and went back down. $60 for a bucket of 6 beers and a cocktail and a 45 minute wait to get said drinks later, we could start trying to relax. The poolside cocktail waitresses didn't even acknowledge us once, even after trying to get their attention. 

Our room also didn't have an ice bucket, so we called the front desk, who transferred us to room service, who transferred us to housekeeping, who took 35 minutes to get to the room. The point was to chill 2 leftover beers from the bucket, but by the time it got there, the moment was lost.The rest of the night was fine, because we went out to another hotel for dinner and walked the strip a bit. End of night one. 

Night 2: The day at the pool was a lot better. We knew the drill and the rules of the place this time so we had no trouble getting in. We rented a day bed for $45 for the day, which turned out to be worth it. We had poolside service, the cocktail waitresses (the same ones from the day before) were really attentive. Every half hour or so she checked on us to make sure we were doing okay. It was a huge comfy circle chair, and had a shade you can pull up to shield you from the sun. Considering we were out there from 1030am-5pm, it was well worth it. That's the only reason for the second star. The booze is still WAY too expensive, even for Vegas. 

Ultimately; 60% of the hotel staff we encountered was rude. The pool was really small for a Vegas pool, but the DJ did a good job. The resort wi-fi that's covered in the $25 daily resort fee SUCKED. We couldn't connect to it worth crap. The beds were comfortable and the room was quiet (minus the people in the room next to us having sex and being able to hear it.) Would we stay here again? Definitely not. Would we recommend it? Honestly, you'd probably be better off at Casino Royal: Best Western, than at TI.",0,0,0

Cons- not a very kid friendly pool, the pool on friday and saturday gets wild with all the hotel drunks partying. Water inside the pool smelled like beer, sunblock, pee and chlorine. The water is also murky with all those people inside.

Its more of a party club pool.

The buffet could be better. Food was bland, not much variety. We went during breakfast.

We were on the 23rd Floor with a Junior Suite and Connecting King Room. In total we had three bathrooms, two beds and a huge couch - more than enough space for all of us and the view of the strip and the fireworks show was phenomenal! 

The renovation was appreciated by all: updated bathrooms, furniture, and technology made the room elegant feeling and a great value for the little that we paid. 

Only downfall to the guest room: Not much lighting in the room intself. The bathrooms were well equipped and I guess that is what really matters. 

Great location on the strip for going to Tao, XS, and Tryst, walking distance to all of them. Also close to the mall and the Venetian for more shopping. We went to Pho in the hotel after a night of going out - the food was a bit expensive but the portions were GIANT and really yummy. 

The hotel also has a really fun Cowboy Bar - Gilley's that we went to almost every night. Drinks are much less than you will pay anywhere else in Vegas so it was a great place to pre-drink before we went to the Clubs at night. 

We went to the pool one day after going to the Encore Beach Party. The pool was fun, there was a DJ and a pretty big crowd dancing and hanging out pool side - a good option if you just want to stay on property but get the feel that you went to a Pool Party.

We had the tower suite with jacuzzi tub and it was very roomy, nicely decorated (comtemporary), and the bed was very comfortable, hence the two stars purely for the room.  So why the low rating?  Because of their service and obvious operations issues.

Our flight got in really really late. I even called on the day of our arrival, to tell them to please hold our room because we will be getting in well after midnight.  By the time we got in, it was around 2 AM due to flight delays. The lady checking us in told us ""We don't have a tower suite, we'll give you a standard room with walk-in shower, but we can have you change room tomorrow"".  

Wait, what?  Why?

Her explanation, ""We have been checking people in since 11 AM.  We are out of tower suites.""

Wait, what?  How is that my problem?  What's the point of making a reservation if you can't hold our room that we booked (like I am in the car reservation Seinfeld episode)?  Are you going to compensate us for giving us a lesser room because we paid a premium for the suite?

Her answer, slightly annoyed, ""No, but you can get a suite tomorrow.""  As if to do us a favor....

Well, that just wasn't good enough, I asked her to call someone to make it work.

She picked up the phone, loudly, right in front of us, ""These two people are upset because they were guaranteed a tower suite."" 

At the end, we got the right room (SURPRISE!! they did have a room that miraculously became available after we complained).  But, fast forward to 5 days later, when we were checking out, we found the rates hiked up $200+.  I had to go back to the front desk and argue about the room rate.  Took me about an hour, working with two front desk clerks and almost missed our flight.

Finally, when they updated my bill to the right quote, they asked, ""did you check in really late?""  

""Yes, and I called ahead of time to inform you guys that my flight will be coming in after midnight.""

Apparently, their explanation to the messed up rate was that because our check in was so late, that the reservation got canceled.  The lady who checked us in, just booked us a new reservation so we lost the rate. I might add that when we got our room, she had us sign room rate acknowledgement using a very small monitor device showing hardly anything.  We questioned that the rate looked high, her response was, ""it includes resort fee and taxes"".  That was a total BS.  When I got the itemized bill, those rates didn't include any fees\/taxes, hence the added $200+ on total bill.

Imagine that, a large casino hotel that does not know (1) how to handle guarantee someone with a room reservation, even after the customer called in to confirm, and (2) does not know how to handle late check in when doing business in a city that does not sleep.

I also could not book the rooms together, and so I was told I could get be assured that I could get two adjoining rooms. Then I was told I could call the morning I was driving in to request ""early check-in"" over the phone to get the rooms I needed. I tried that and was told that was not the case, and I had to be there. I really don't like feeling deceived. I also had to pay for the first night up front, which was annoying but fine, and then I misjudged the cost because in that first night that I had already paid for they had not included the nearly $23 resort fee, which provides a bunch of perks that we couldn't use, including the buffet that is only good Monday-Friday. We checked in on Friday, so we could have used it for dinner I guess, but we were not told it was only good on Friday, and we read the fine print too late. There were also fitness passes (which would have been cool if our feet didn't hate us), $20 off your next stay, which really just means one day of the resort fee you will be charged again, and some 2 for 1 cocktails.

There is a serious shortage of outlets, which was incredibly annoying when you have phones to plug in, want to do your hair, and listen to music.

Why do non-smokers not automatically get suites??

CONS-Housekeeping\/maids and MANAGER

-Housekeeping\/maids are slow. I asked for extra towels around 10pm after I checked in. It took them about 40 minutes!
-Second day, I asked for extra pillows and because it was uncomfortable and I like my head to be elevated when I sleep. It took them longer than an hour to bring me 4 pillows and eventually I just left the room to get food so who knows if they even got here in an hour.. I was gone for 3 hours. 
-Second night, it was 2am and I was exhausted from the clubs so I decided to sleep. I was cold and called in for a blanket. Was told it will take 10 minutes to 1 hour. IS IT 10 minutes or is it 1 hour?!?! There's a big difference. Are you kidding me? I offered to give a tip over the phone if they hustle and they said ok. They got here in 30-40 minutes. 
-I don't care if the no disturb sign is up because who remembers to take it down after making at call at 2am trying to request more blankets?! Thanks for calling the room to ask if we still wanted to blankets.. You woke all my friends up. You don't get a tip!

-Night time MANAGER on 5\/26\/2012 or 5\/27\/2012... YOU ARE AN IDIOT
-not qualified for the job, rude, contradicted herself in the argument, and unhelpful
-complained about the housekeeping\/maids taking to long and I barely got an apology from her

       Told her that housekeeping was slow at getting our requested items and she said it was because they have 2900 rooms to accommodate and they probably had a lot of people calling in at 2am asking for stuff. We told her that it was throughout the whole day that it was slow. She blamed it on it being Memorial Day  Weekend and that they had so many guests and not enough housekeepers. So we told her that if it was such a busy weekend, why didn't you put more on the job so you wouldn't be so understaffed. She argued back saying they weren't understaffed (contradiction #1). And here we are wondering.. then why are they so slow? 10 minutes to 1 hour? really?! that's a big time difference. 10 minutes is no problem. 1 hour is a big problem! I could have went to buy my own towels and blankets in that time frame. Her excuse was that there's a priority list of first come first serve. After 5 more minutes of arguing, she said she would call housekeeping herself and tell them to expedite our order. What happened to first come first serve?! I don't care if we came down to complain, you shouldn't be putting us before others just because we're arguing with you in person. I respect the first come first serve idea, but this is where she contradicted herself (contradiction #2). All we asked for was to better your service as a whole and she had not solution for that and no way to make it up to us. We compared TI service to Encore. When we reported something to Encore, they accommodated to our needs AND they gave us resort credit as a sincere apology. The manager at TI couldn't accommodate our needs or do anything in general. She was just rude the whole time.

PRO-the security guy downstairs that brought us to the manager
-the ONLY helpful staff that I encountered all weekend
-at least I got a ""sorry"" from him and he was nice
-give this guy a promotion

Stayed here on my first Vegas trip - clean and fairly large rooms, free & semi-entertaining show out front, and great location, VERY convenient if you're going clubbing at Tao, Lavo, or XS - they're all within walking distance, as are a lot of other things - Walgreens is also right across the street which I found super convenient! 

BUT, I booked through priceline.com which said the resort fee was to be included. However, as I went to check out, I found this was not the case. TI doesn't include the resort fee at all if you book through a third-party website (Priceline apologized to me for this, but said it was out of their control, the resort fee was supposed to be included) I ended up being charged an additional $88 for my 3 night stay. Ridiculous. The resort fee doesn't even really cover anything useful, unless you want to use the wireless internet or fitness center. I wouldn't have been so annoyed if maybe it had included a discount to their Cirque show, but it doesn't.

I probably would not stay here again, because it was just so ridiculous to deal with them. But, the location is very convenient if you don't want to pay for cabs - this & the cleanliness earn TI 2.5 stars.",0,0,0

Bestie and I packed up the car Friday night and took off! We arrived @ ""TI"" around 11 and the check in line was brief, despite the anticipated nightmare long lines mentioned here and on other travel websites. By booking online, for 3 nights we stayed in an upgraded strip view room for around $250. Our room was so cute! The beds were ridiculously comfortable, and everything was super clean. A few cosmetic touch ups may be necessary, but I guess I'm not so nit-picky. The TV was nice, we liked being able to plug in our ipods, and the wireless internet did what we needed to. Room - 4 Stars.

On our 2nd night there, after a day of binge drinking and a nap we decided to take it easy and hang in our own casino, did some gambling and around 2am went to the Coffee House and were SO DISAPPOINTED! The menu was so ridiculously limited that we almost just walked out. There are probably less than 10 items on the menu, including any dessert items...So limited that not even FRENCH FRIES are on the menu, yet $16 burgers exists. The food was pretty bland...however the French Onion soup was amazing, thank god. On another negative note, our server was SUCH AN ASSHOLE! Then when the manager came to check on us, the server was there and did something very nice, we both said @ the same time ""Oh NOW he's nice??"" and the manager pretended not to hear us. Any drink refill, condiment request, check request, change request, was attended to with a delay and dirty looks. Prices are the same in the Coffee House as the ROOM SERVICE, so skip the moody server and eat in your comfy bed. Coffee Shop - 1 Star

On our 2nd day there we lounged by the pool all day, and the DJ was awesome. At first we attempted ordering drinks from the outdoor servers but they were so slow we started trekking in and out of Kahunaville for our drinks. While the drinks were good, they were severely over priced, even when you're armed with their ""coupons"" which barely made a dent in a round of drinks for 4, and half the time to coupons were good for what we wanted. A round of 2 mixed drinks and 2 beers will run you $40. Pool\/Kahunaville - 2 Stars

Overall our stay was decent but the NOW $30 a day resort fee, rules, regulations, and restrictions were kind of a bummer. Don't offer ""coupons"" or ""offers"" if you have no intention of allowing your customers to use them on anything of worth. Oh, and the buffett is overpriced and just like any standard buffet food. 

Just a tip: When drinking poolside for 8 hours straight, don't abandoned your best friend\/roommate, and then you REALLY don't want to latch the top lock and proceed to fall into a drunken coma till 1 am. She wont be pleased. Rookie move.",3,3,2

Here's how it breaks down:

SERVICE: Excellent customer service at the front desk, although I think the interior bell desk (there are two) has agents that don't come off as helpful.  

CLEANLINESS: It has obviously undergone an overhaul in recent years, and it shows.  It's in great shape with a strong attention to cleanliness detail.

CASINO: Not the biggest of the hotel casinos by any stretch of the imagination, but I was able to turn 6 bucks into 30, so it suited my low-spender wallet just fine.  I'm not much of a gambler, unless it's with someone else's money.

RESTAURANTS: They have the one All-American joint just as you head to the elevators to go to the rooms, and it's just okay. It's what you would expect for a reasonably-priced place that people don't seek out as a destination eatery.  It's a place to go when you don't want to cab anywhere, want to eat something you've eaten before, and can easily spell everything on the menu.

NIGHTLIFE: Went to the Christian Audigier and it's what you would expect: guys coming in actually wearing a Christian Audigier shirt, while posing in the euro shoes and jeans, watching booties shake, and not really looking all that cool.

ROOM: Beds rival that of the W chain, which I think has the most comfortable beds in the world.  Seriously, I fell asleep so quickly, I didn't even have time to continue enjoy being drunk.",0,0,1

I ordered room service: a cosmopolitan and buffalo chicken wings, but the wings turned out to be tenders and extremely salty =\/ One thing negative about my stay was that the tub stopper didn't work and even though I called housekeeping to fix it, it never did.

I remember looking forward to going to Vegas as a child just to see the awesome pirate shows that were on display in the evenings. I remember lining up with the mass crowds way before the show started just to get a good view. I also remember fearing the show was going to be cancelled if there were high winds that day. Reminiscing about this place is awesome, but sadly, the modern day TI has lost its appeal. 

My latest stay here (now grown up) left much to be desired. At least one of the elevators broke on all the days I stayed here... sometimes they would both be out of service so you would have to wait for the elevator or walk up and down the stairs. The tram station that takes you to and from the Mirage was shut down half the time and their food options were not good or affordable. Take for example, a bowl of pho at their pho shop costs $16 (wtf?), their margaritas were so watered down, and their pizza probably tastes worst than what you can get at 7\/11. Did I mention their toilets were clogged too? Sometimes you had to flush multiple times before it worked. Absolutely disgusting. 

And might I add, the pirate show is completely gone. Never to be seen again! SO SAD :(((( You can take away anything from this hotel, but why would you take away the pirate show?!?!? That's like taking away part of my childhood right there :((( What a big bummer...... 

Checking in\/out can be a big hassle depending on when you do it. During check-in, there was about 100 people waiting in line and just a few people working. It took a good 40 minutes to get to the front of the line. I kid you not. The one plus was that the rates were affordable here in comparison to other hotels. But I realized you aren't getting a bang for your buck because the amenities kind of suck here. The glory days of Treasure Island are all in the past now and unfortunately, I don't think it will ever come back again. So sad to see. I would skip this hotel and book elsewhere.",18,8,8

I arrived just after noon and was able to check-in fairly easily (although, for such a large hotel and on the weekend with the rodeo and marathon and other things going on in town, it wouldn't hurt to beef up the staff so folks wouldn't have to wait so long for this) and get in my room immediately.

I had used Priceline's Name Your Own Price, so the rate I got for the one night was cheap and the room didn't disappoint. The room appeared recently renovated, was a good size, had a comfortable bed, and I was on the 11th floor, facing out towards the Palazzo. The bathroom was clean and well-appointed. For an older hotel, the rooms definitely had a nice modern touch, which I always appreciate.

I knew about the resort fee when checking in, but that doesn't mean I still don't think it's ridiculous. I used none of the ""amenities"" listed, as they weren't necessary for me.

The convenience to everything on the Strip was nice - I was able to easily make it over to the Venetian to pick up my race packet and easily able to jump into Harrah's to catch the monorail down south for the race.

The only other downfall was the mass exodus of people checking out at noon. An express checkout process from the room would be so much more convenient, and you'd have to think TI would save in labor costs in doing so as well.

Granted, I didn't spend a lot of time in TI itself, but here are the positives that stood out to me:

1) The self-parking garage is close to the guest elevators. This to me is a big plus. I hate having to lug all my stuff through the casino. This becomes even more important when we have hella drinks and partying ish to carry as well.

2) Its proximity to some of the bigger clubs. Last time we stayed at Harrah's, our buzz wore off by the time we walked to XS. Here at TI, you're across the street from Wynn\/Encore\/Venetian. You're literally one walkway away from XS and Tao, which is a huge plus.

3) Cheappp. It's obviously no Venetian but it's seriously fine for me since the only times I'm in the room is when I'm pre-gaming or when I'm sleeping  (and how your Vegas experience should be like too).

Basically, if you are going in a big group, are planning to pack everyone into a suite to save money, and are going to spend more time outside the room anyways, then TI isn't a bad option. It's on the Strip, walking distance to XS and Tao, and it's a good money-saver.",1,0,0

1st time @ TI- and I'm a big fan.. THe hotel isn't that big but big enough to feel comfortable if that makes sense. The check in was quick, I was able to get checked in at 11am, Had a strip view on the 33rd Floor, top floors had their own elevator that you need a key for, nice touch for security reasons if you're all skeered and stuff.. 

The room was really nice, good view facing south strip, saw the the Mirage Valcano and all that kinda stuff.  But the room was really cozy, decent size bathroom and the beds were sooo comfy!! THe best part was the IPOD docking station, always a plus to put on the jams as your drinking and two stepping and getting ready to go out for the night..

The hotel wa very liberal, we acted a fool at times nobody said anything to us, I guess we went during the Rodeo Finals so are hotel was filled with belt buckle wearing county Folks. They were cool though, I don't mind, a lot were loud and funny, just meant for better times at the table. I heard a lot of "" Yeee Haws""  but whatever it was all in good spirits.

We didnt do much clubbing this time more of a gambling trip but we we're begged to go to the Christian Audigiar night Club, they gave us free admission and stuff.. The club was decent, kind of small but they played really good music. (my opinion of really good music was hip hop and a mix of some 80's and 90's hits)  Drinks are ok priced too. Not a bad option, if you're staying at TI I think the room key gives you free admission.

The pool sucked, it was closed but if you're going in the summer pools I would not stay here, The pool was so small, I could not imagine it in the summer time...

The location of the TI was the best though, connected via walkway bridge to the mall, cross the street to the Wynn, Palazzo and Venetian and tram to the Mirage.

Ummm I wish my report was more exciting but it was a gambling trip.

Good times, will stay there again only in the winter and if we got a good rate like last time...

Also there is no where to put your towel while you're in the shower.  NO COFFEE IN THE ROOM.  Ugh, for the price of a room over 150.00 throw in some coffee! Motel 6 and 8 do.  Please note, they do not do the pirate shows anymore.  Pool is nice and the set up great.  Rented a  cabana for 6 hrs for 80 bucks that included a TV, music (but the music in the pool area is too loud to play it) a safe and mini fridge along with seating and lounge chairs and a mister system that was a little to far away.

Treasure Island staff was friendly. Elevators were well guarded, as they were right off the casino. I was here without my husband (because of the conference) & felt very safe. Nice that it was connected to the Fashion Show Mall--gave a place to walk around when the weather was too cold to be outside comfortably at night. HOWEVER...the ceilings are low, so the smoking inside made the ENTIRE hotel smell musty & old. I was in a non-smoking room--which itself was fine. As soon as I'd walk out to the elevator, though, I felt like I smelled like an ash tray all. the. time. Also, since it was toward the end of the strip, I didn't see much other than the hotels immediately around it. I don't gamble so I can't comment on the casino.

After years of relying on Yelp to help me select restaurants, spas, auto mechanics, dry cleaners, doctors, etc. I am finally opening my own account because I need to write this review for Treasure Island.

I come to Vegas all the time...and this was the first time I stayed at Treasure Island.  Worst hotel experience of my life in Las Vegas.  DO NOT STAY HERE.  

They charged our credit card for the wrong amount and caused all sorts of problems with our bank.  The entire staff was completely over-the-top rude. I got denied from their lame ass bar called ""Gilley's.""  This is how it went:

Manager at Gilley's: (looking at my ID) You're not 21.
Me: No, I'm not. I'm 23.
Manager: This isn't you.
Me: Yes it is.
Manager: What's your sign?
Me: Gemini.
Manager: This isn't you.
Me: What the hell? Yes it is. I look exactly the same. Look, here's my credit card with the same name on it.  And here, look at my phone.  My background has my last name on it.  And I have my e-mail address saved on here with my name.
Manager: You're not getting in.
Me: What? We've already been to like two clubs tonight.  Look at our stamps.  I'm clearly over 21.  Why don't I go to my room and get my entire wallet to show you my student ID and all my cards?
Manager: Don't bother.  We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone and you're not getting in.


Oh it gets worse.  Then we try to go to the pool but you need a hotel key to show as proof that you're staying there.  We checked out already so we had returned the key.....I understand that the guy was just doing his job but he was SO RUDE in the way that he told us.  Finally my cousin found a key in her purse that she thought she had lost so he let us in.

But I'd say the worst thing that happened at Treasure Island was the fact that the VALET TRIED TO STEAL MY FUCKING CAR.  I got my car back after waiting half an hour for the stupid valet and the anti-theft had been activated.  The car computer had been completely disabled and someone had made several attempts to crack the code.  All my radio stations I had saved had been changed...A CD that was in the disk drive had been removed, and to top it all off the jumper cables that I keep in my trunk had been stashed under the driver's seat.  COMPLETELY SHADY. And they returned my car to me like that!!!

Complained to the manager and he said next time we come to Vegas we can get a free suite there.  I told him it wasn't worth it.  I will never stay there again.",7,4,2

The morning after the first night, he woke up with 22 bug bites all over his arms, chest, back, and face. We called housekeeping and told them that the room was contaminated. They offered to move us to a different room, yet we were on a tight schedule for the day and didn't want to wait over an hour to be moved to a room. Since we decided to stay, they assured us that the sheets were changed and the room was clean. The next morning, I woke up with over 10 red, swollen bites all over my arms. I called the front desk and they told me they'd immediately send someone up to investigate it, but immediately for them meant an hour. 

The ""engineering team"" came up to the room with snarky attitudes and not much to say. They seemed to take the situation very lightly even know I was covered in red, swollen, oozing bites all over my arms. They gave me the paperwork to file a report, but were so vague on when I would hear back and how to get into contact with them.

When I got back home to California, I went to the Emergency Room to see what had bitten me. It had gotten to the point that I was so itchy I couldn't even sleep. I spent $100 to be seen in the ER, and the doctor confirmed that I was bitten by bed bugs and I had an allergic reaction to them. She advised me to dry clean all of my belongings that I brought to Las Vegas, and even suggested that I stay home from work.

I spent over $70 dry cleaning my clothes, assuming that Treasure Island would reimburse me for the fees that I had incurred since the incident.

A week has now gone by and my boyfriend and I are still covered in bites. Just this morning I spoke with Ashley from Risk Management, who said they didn't find bug activity in the room. She said that the room is being rented right now (GROSS) and that they aren't responsible for anything that has happened to me. She didn't apologize for my inconveniences and in fact, she HUNG UP ON ME before our conversation was over. I even asked her what she would do in my situation and she hardly had an answer.

I am so disgusted and disappointed with the quality of service and treatment provided by Treasure Island. Every single staff member that I encountered was rude and unsympathetic. They are completely lying when they say you're a ""valued guest"" because it's obvious that they don't give a damn who you are and what your experience was. 

I will certainly never give this hotel another penny of mine and I know the same is true for everyone I tell of this incident.",5,0,0

The wait for check-in was 45 minutes, and when we finally go the room, IT WASN'T EVEN MADE!!!  There was trash all over the room, candy wrappers and other food waste on the blankets and all over the floors.  I called the front desk to complain and they said I had two options:  Wait 1 hour or longer for housekeeping to make the room, or walk back down to the front desk and get another room key.  I chose the 2nd option.  You'd think that after a royal screw-up like this, THEY should come to me instead of asking me to make the 5-minute trek back to the front desk.  Or at least offer a free dinner buffet, which would have made me forget the whole ordeal..  But I got nothing other than ""Ooops sorry"".  And once I returned to the front desk I had to wait another 10 minutes to get the new room!

What a joke.

First off: I long for the Treasure Island of my youth. With a good old-fashioned pirate show - that means shit blowing up, and non-6 packed Pirates saying ARRR and being menacing, not the Showgirls-esque, Fabio sirens and pirates of today with the big dance number and cheesy ass romance plot-line. But, I digress. 

T.I., as it is now known, is definitely not a place I would ever stay again. For roughly $180 a night, I was expecting a lot more than we got. True, the rooms were nice. Bed was comfy, etc. But the first night there (after a horrific drunken Flair Bartender contest at Kahunaville), we were awoken at 9am Expedia Commercial style by jackhammering. Yes, a JACKHAMMER. At 9am, with raging hangovers. How is this possible, you ask? Well, when I called down to the front desk, I learned they were doing CONSTRUCTION ON THE FLOOR BELOW US. 

Here is the conversation I had with the front desk: 

me: Hi...um. We were woken up by a loud noise that sounds like a jackhammer, and it's still going on. 

desk: Oh...yeah. It looks like we're doing construction on the floor below you. Do you want to move?

me: .... (thinking: do I WANT? to? move?) Well YES. We would like to move, since it's so loud.

desk: Okay. Well. Hmm. We could send someone up to get your things, but we're busy and I have no idea how long it would take. Can you just come down with your luggage and we'll get you another room?

me: ... Yeah, whatever. 

So after that, we went down to the front desk to even more horrible customer service (also while packing up my stuff, I noticed that the last person's dirty socks were under the bed). No sorry! None! NO SORRY, whatsoever. Just an annoyed sigh, and head nod, some bitchiness, and a new room key. I was so pissed I was afraid of what I might say, so I gave myself some time to cool down. In the meantime, my mom decided to ask for a manager, who said ""Whoops! Sorry about that. Yeah...that's a problem"". That is it. That's all he said! 

Now look, I was not expecting a huge discount or even drink comps, but how about a little compassion and some admittance that perhaps you screwed up by booking people into rooms above a floor with jackhammers??? 

Add in the worst buffet food I've ever had (at $18 a pop) AND the fact that the pool closes at 6:30 on a Saturday night, and I'm out, T.I. Keep your damn scantily clad sirens away from me...

But if you were to grade Treasure Island\/TI on a curve with other Vegas hotels, particularly its neighbors, this place is a 1.5 stars at best. If I were to personify Vegas hotels, TI would be that guy in his thirties that still attends college parties. On one hand, you got to almost respect that he is still going at it after all these years and at times his age is almost more of a novelty than inappropriate. But, on the other hand, eventually you resent him for not realizing this crowd doesn't take him seriously. Because the party has changed over the years but one thing remains constant, Pirate themed hotels just aren't chic. And no amount of re-branding is going to change that. And although you do have really comfortable beds , clean rooms, and a central-as-it-gets location, you just aren't up to par. Your pool is pitiful, tiny, and has an undeniable Daytona Spring Break vibe to it. Your restaurants are a joke. Your staff has an attitude, almost as if they keep applying for positions at all the great hotels popping up next door but no one will take them seriously because they are treasure island employees. 15 minutes on hold for the front desk? Drink coupons that none of your bars would redeem for different reasons? Half finished drink left unattended quickly thrown out by grounds crew who ignored the several empty cups in the same spot? A surprise 'facility use' charge sprung upon us at check-in?

We stayed Thursday-Sunday in a tower suite.  Check in went quick.  Finding our elevator was easy. Be prepared to show your room key EVERYTIME you go to the room elevators. Inconvenient yet it made me feel better knowing random people weren't hanging in the hallways.  The room was nice. Double doors, very spacious, 2 restrooms. 1 with a walk in closet and dresser. Vanity with ottoman and magnifying mirror double sink,  toilet and jacuzzi tub.  The second restroom had a huge shower, toilet, sink with tons of counter space and closet with safe.  This restroom had VERY dim lighting.
 The king size bed with extra pillows was super comfy,  as was the HUGE ""L"" shaped couch.  Good size glass top table,  coffee table,  TV, entertainment center with mini fridge and desk furnished the suite. The view is spectacular however the windows were filthy. Kinda took away from it. I was pretty surprised just how much this hotel had to do. From 1,000's of slots and tables,  restaurants,  show,  pool,  cvs,  starbucks,  it was easy to not have to venture out. I did run into a few issues this trip.
 Housekeeping took 2 phone calls and over 2 hours to bring up an extra blanket. Apparently the first time I called the person answering ""didn't let anyone know"". No apology no owning their mistake,  instead 2 hours later I had someone literally kicking my door yelling housekeeping.  When I opened the door I was basically thrown my blanket and the person turned around and walked away before I could even get a word out. Also head an issue with getting the Jets to work in the tub. Called front desk and asked for any tips. Was told I'd have to wait for maintenance could take an hour. Not really what I wanted to do. Asked for a better ETA and was given major attitude and told I just needed to wait. When maintenance showed up he was rude and seemed very bothered that he had to do HIS JOB!!! Resort fee is lame especially since the items included you don't actually get.  Had to have front desk print my boarding pass since the computers that are meant for that use are not updated and would not work.

Our room was great, nice bathroom, good sized room, very clean and comfortable. Didn't spend much time elsewhere in the hotel as everywhere else on the strip is so much better. 

If you want to spend a day relaxing by the pool, this is not the place to do it. Very cramped, lots of people and loud music. As with most places in Vegas, the drinks are VERY expensive and not that great. 

The man working at the bell desk was very forceful in asking for a tip. As someone who isn't from a country with a tipping culture, it's hard to know when is right to tip and how much to tip. I handed him my 3 bags and he said, in a kind of rude and patronising tone, 'tips are appreciated'. So I asked him how much is normal to tip someone who has done nothing more except tie a tag to my bags, and he didn't want to tell me. Eventually I got him to suggest a $1 a bag, so that's what I did. I just think, at a hotel, people should be prepared to teach people from different cultures the local customs in a polite way.

 There was nothing really wrong with my stay here, I would just probably choose to go to one of the other famous hotels on the strip instead next time.",3,0,0

Here are the Pro's: large room, very nicely decorated, great view, excellent security at the elevators, CVS on site.

Cons:  the check in staff was rude and difficult!  Willing to take my money but not helpful and completely unrealistic!

No heat in the room.  It was 45 degrees outside and when I complained, they did respond quickly BUT to show they'd been there and fixed the problem, they turned the heat up so high we walked into a sauna.

Toilet running and was fixed by my husband twice.  They had to come fix that too!

No blankets in the room and when we called down for them they brought an extremely thin, old, rough blanket that was like sleeping under sandpaper.  Remember, we had no heat!

Maid service was extremely lax...they never even wiped the bathroom counters as evidenced by the water marks from our water glasses.

No coffee pot.

All restaurants were extremely expensive.  

For $200\/per night I expected better...and don't forget all hotels in Vegas have a ""resort fee"" that's on top of the nightly rate.

First and last time we will stay at the TI Hotel!",3,3,0

This stay was more ballin' than my last because we got upgraded to the 34th floor (out of 36 floors).  I went to check-in, and the lady laughed at how my friend requested that we get an upgrade on the reservation.  She noted that he sounded super polite, and had correct grammar.  I said we were teachers-it's natural!  She said she'll give us the only room available on the top floors.  Sweeeeeeet!  She was super fun to talk to :D

One con-they don't have toothbrushes (two people forgot theirs), and they said anytime they have to bring something up (we asked for a wine opener) it would cost $5.  'Er...?  Even the cheap motels have both for free.

Check-in was a breeze as we came on a Thursday afternoon before the weekend rush. Our front desk agent was very friendly and great in suggesting restaurant options. Also she was nice enough to give a us a room with a strip view! *high five!* Within five minutes we were on our way.

Treasure Island (TI) is a great location depending on the activities you want to do. Luckily for us majority of the things we did happened to be on our side of the strip. It's within walking distance to the Venetian Shops and Walgreen's and if you go out of the hotel and make a left you hit some shops and restaurants.

Their pool is a nice size and plenty of chairs to lay on and you can even order a fruity drink like the Miami Vice (Pina Colada and Strawberry Daiquiri mix) from one of the serving girls while sunbathing! Hungry? Kahunaville has an outdoor patio where you can chill and order some grub.

Our room is average, nothing too rave about, and every time we leave and place our ""room need to be clean"" card in our key card holder it's always clean and towels restock upon our return. It's very welcoming to come back to a clean room after a tiring day in the sun.

(+) In a great location on the strip, you are connected(via tram) to the Mirage and within walking distance to Venetian, Palazzo, Wynn, Encore, Harrahs, and Caesars. Also Fashion Show Mall just north of the property. Prime location, actually!
(+) Slots have always at least given me some play and every now and again some money! One of the better places to play on the Strip, if you ask me.
(+) casino is not too big and rather easy to navigate
(+) Home of the first ever Cirque show on the Strip, Mystere. Great show. See separate review. https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/cirque-du-soleil-myst%C3%A8re-las-vegas-2
(+) Plenty of food and store options to choose from. Personally, I think I enjoyed Gilley's the most.
(+) CVS on site near the sportsbook actually has some great prices for toiletries and whatnot that are very good considering your location.

(-) I am not a fan of the some of the changes of recent years, namely losing the Pirate show, losing the skull and crossbones sign, and building that brown monstrosity of a building in the front of the bay. To me, it looks very out of place. I miss the old Treasure Island in a lot of ways.
(-) Pool area is rather small considering the size and location of the property its self.
(-) Some of the food outlets are not very good at all. Namely Senor Frogs and Kahunaville (which apparently just closed permanently!)

For the location, I believe TI offers a lot of value in a lot of ways. That being said, I do miss the old TI I remember from the 90's and early 2000's. I still swing by here a lot and bring friends and family by when they visit. It is still A-OK.

Cons: Hotel layout, especially for checking in; ""somewhat upscale"" in Las Vegas translates into lagging a bit behind the pack

Stayed here when we went to the Gamestop Expo (awesome!). We only stayed two nights and pretty much didn't venture outside the hotel or the convention center, so my review may be a little lopsided, but here it goes...

The first thing we noticed was the awkward layout which made check-in cumbersome. The TI's only parking is in a parking structure in the back of the hotel. The front of the hotel is mainly for valet parking services, taxis, etc. So to check in you have to drive into the parking structure, take all your bags with you (unless you want to make a separate trip back for them after check-in), drag them all around the hotel until you get to the front lobby, and then drag them back to the center of the hotel to the elevator, then to your room. Since you start off in the parking structure, there aren't any luggage carts around. I suppose you could walk bagless to the check-in desk and then ask for help, but we just wanted to get to our room.

Otherwise the stay was nice. Our room safe wasn't working, but a call to the front desk and about an hour and half later they had the technician in our room. Everything else worked like it was supposed to and the beds didn't leave me with a sore back. Room was nicely decorated and clean. It looked upscale compared to my usual middle-of-the-road Comfort Inn.

Unfortunately, Vegas is also pretty lavish and posh, so what is a little upscale compared to all other hotels is on the trailing edge when compared to all Vegas Strip accommodations. The TI was still a good value, though, considering its location next to the shopping mall and across the street from the Venetian; CVS downstairs is really convenient. Since I am out and about during the day and only use the hotel room to sleep in, I would definitely consider the TI on a future trip.",2,0,1

The Bell Hop informed us that we wouldn't be able to check in until about 12 pm, but they'd hold our bags and after we check in, we can call down and they'll deliver our bags.  So we decided to have breakfast in their 24 hour coffee shop and gamble until then.

We were able to check in at 11 am and my BF asked if there were any room upgrades available.  The lady who was helping us was very nice and friendly, she said she'd see what she could get us and then delivered us a corner room with ""panoramic"" windows.

We had a pretty high room (25th floor) and a view of the strip - Palazzo right in front of us and Fashion Show Mall to the left.  It was a nice comfy room with a comfortable bed.  The bathroom is roomy with good counter space and lots of towels for the 2 of us!  The only bad thing I can think of, is that there wasn't any toilet paper in the bathroom when we arrived!  There was a roll, but it was empty.  Good thing I noticed way before I had to go!

We could see and hear the show from our room, but it's hard to understand what's going on if you haven't watched it before - which we haven't.  And when I say ""hear"", it's all muffled noise!  Haha...if you're a light sleeper, the noise and fireworks may wake you.

We didn't go down to the pool, but the slot machines were pretty good - lots to choose from and lots of table games also.  There are a handful of restaurants to choose from, and some fast food options - something for everyone.

I did read someones review before we left that the casino area had a distinct smell.  Which it did - almost like a strawberry incense smell - very strong and noticeable - unlike other casinos.  Every time we walked in from the outside or came down from our room, I noticed it.  Not irritating, but just very noticeable.

In fact, I go to Vegas for my birthday each year, and we always stay at Treasure Island. I honestly don't have one negative thing to say about it. So I will mention what I loved in detail:

1.) The rates are insanely affordable (depending on the dates) for a four-star place on the Vegas strip. This is not the Tropicana or Circus Circus. But you get a clean, beautiful, and modern room for nearly the same price.

2.) The rooms are always clean. Everything always works. The housekeeping is excellent. You can tell that the hotel was remodeled recently because the tile and decor in the bathrooms are gorgeous. I stayed in the petite suite one weekend and the spacious tub there is amazing. Don't get me started on the beds! SO comfortable. 

3.) I LOVE the Coffee Shop. That's one of the cafe-type eateries located on the first floor of the hotel. The breakfast menu is the best part of the restaurant. I usually have the smoked salmon plate and they give you enough food for three people. Make sure to share the entrees.

4.) The entertainment at the pool is fun. For instance, you can usually find the DJ either playing the latest music, or having people play games.

5.) The check in and check out is effortless. Even if you run into a long line, the concierge make sure to have enough people working so the line passes by fast.

In conclusion, TI rocks and those who were unhappy with their stay are insane nit pickers.",1,0,2

I wanted to take this opportunity to let you know how disappointed my husband and I were during our stay at Treasure Island this past weekend.  Initially, we were excited to stay at your hotel because from the reviews it sounded like a good option.  I went on your website and I was impressed with all of the promotions that you offer.  In addition, I became a part of your MyTI member to take advantage of your special ""FIRST OFFER"" deal.  I was disappointed how I was given a cheaper deal and within an hour when I attempted to book, the price had increased.  Then I decided to use your free buffet offer.  I noticed that the offer would not appear on the reservation, even though I added it.  I read the fine print and it said that unless I mentioned it upon check- in, it would not be honored.  When I checked in, I mentioned it and was told that it was not valid.  I was not given an acceptable explanation, except that it was not a part of the reservation.  What is the purpose of your promotions, if you do not honor the codes upon check in.  I do not understand why in your fine print you state that the customer has to mention it.  Why not make it easy for the customer and allow us to add the code(s) to our reservation, and clearly show it on the confirmation.  The promotions sound great but you make it difficult  and confusing for the customer. 
 
With regards to our reservation, when I made the reservation I received a confirmation on-line with a price for each night.  However, when I received the confirming email it had a higher price.  I emailed you with my concern and never received a reply from anyone letting me know that the adjustment had been made.  That made me feel as if you did not care about my business.  As you know, customer service is everything.  I would suggest that you reply to emails when a customer has an inquiry; it goes a long way.  
 
When I made the reservation I reserved  a deluxe non-smoking room, with a king sized bed. Upon our check-in, we were told that you did not have the room that we reserved available and gave us a deluxe smoking room, with two double beds.  What is the point of reserving a room, when you can change the room at your discretion.   Nevertheless. we our bound by the agreement to pay you whether we stay or not but you are not willing to comply with your part of the agreement. It is seems very unfair.  Anyway, the reason I chose a non-smoking room was because my husband has asthma.   
 
In addition, your valet service was horrible.  We waited about 15 minutes for our car. There were three families that were there after us and they got their car before us.  When I asked the person at the desk, he told us that the reason some of the cars were brought before ours was because it depended where the car was parked.  I thought his reply was  ridiculous, there should be a comprehensive system based on the customers that arrive first.  
 
Due to my experience with your hotel, we will not be staying at it again nor will I give a recommendation to my friends.  I will yelp my experience and hope that we can prevent this situation to occur to other families.",0,1,0

Me and my boyfriend ending up staying here because it was the cheapest hotel for the weekend. We spent about $260 for 3 days and 2 nights, thats including the resort fee. The room and bathrooms were nice and spacious. The beds were super comfy and the pillows felt like clouds. 

My only complaint was that the cleaning person did not come and fix the room. We left early Saturday morning and came back in the afternoon thinking we were gone long enough for our room to be cleaned and it wasn't.

Overall our stay was nice. Check in was fast, but that was probably because we came around 8pm on Friday. Check out was easy, we just did it from our TV in the room and dropped the keys in the drop box by the elevators on the first floor.",2,0,0

Stayed for one night in a room with two queen beds-- the room was clean, well maintained and spacious enough for the three of us staying there. It had a bucket for ice, a nice bathroom, a safe, a mini fridge (hidden in the closet), ironing board and iron, nice flat screen tv, and a bunch of space if you need to unpack your luggage in drawers. We had a room which looked towards the lonely Trump Hotel up north. Other than that, the hotel staff were friendly enough, the casino was pretty standard with all the usual gambling tables and slots, though we didn't really gamble much there. 

Location: The hotel is located at the northern end of the action on the strip, across the street from the Venetian and the Palazzo, and down the road from the Mirage and Caesars Palace. I personally wouldn't book a hotel any further north than this (ie Circus Circus or Trump) if you are planning on walking around throughout the course of your stay, or else you'll be taking a long long walk to get to the fun.  

Downsides: It is a bit of a trek walking from the self serve parking lot to check-in, so best to have wheelie luggage. We visited the pool which was okay, they seemed to close a lot earlier than people had hoped, as everyone was disappointed when they were told they had to get out. Also, apparently they no longer have the pirate show out front, didn't really care to inquire further, but it would have been cool to check that out.   

Price: We booked about a week and a half in advance and got a room for around $110 for a Saturday night through orbitz, with a coupon code. I've also heard that trying the $20 cash trick when you check in will get you an upgraded room, but as we weren't planning on spending that much time in the room so thought we might as well spend our money elsewhere. You also have to pay a service fee at the hotel, which covers internet, and random other amenities that no one cares about, which is $25. They do gladly offer late check out, if you are too groggy to get out on time, but it will cost you $40 extra.",1,0,0

We waited about 30+ minutes when we checked in Saturday afternoon. Expect long wait. They charge everyone resort fees for wifi and other ""amenities"" including coupons for future stay at TI, none of which we needed. 

Room: Room is quite nice actually. Comfy and sufficient. 

Check-out: Check-out time was 11am for us. The hotel texts you and lets you know the night before how to check-out via texts. Pretty convenient. Or else expect a line if you want to go to the front desk for physical check-out. 

Luggage drop-off: The bell desk out front is very efficient with luggage drop off and pick ups. The luggages go through a conveyor belt and are somehow tagged so that they could easily be located when needed. If you drop off the luggage before you check in, they will deliver the luggage to your room shortly after you give them a call.",1,0,0

Although you can tell at one time the company vision was clearly on a pirate theme, and as it was I hear it was an adventurous stay back in its hay-day. 
    Unfortunately now it seems as if the Casino has long attempted to pull away from the theme yet it still has the remnant pirate ship of its forgotten theme at the ""pier""of the hotel entrance. 
     Other than not owning up to a theme such as all the rest of the hotels on the strip, I have to give it credit, where it lacks vision, it makes up in cheap table limits!!! Has one of the lowest table limits on the main strip! Plus, next door you have the open air ""Fashion Show"" Mall",2,0,0

It's really nothing crazy and does not meet the extravagant and above and beyond hotels in Vegas. They are far less expensive than the typical 5 star hotel price. During non-peak days, you can find a room for $50. 

I really don't like the pool at TI. It's very small and it's cheesy. There is no theme carried on in the pool area unlike other Vegas hotels. However, the rooms are nice for the most part. They are in the small side, but still feel a bit luxurious... As luxurious as $50 in Vegas can get. 

The buffet sucks so don't even bother. The coffee shop (24 hour restaurant) is okay if you like diner type food that's over priced.. Especially for watered down coffee. The Venetian has a much better 24 hour restaurant. 

It's a beautiful thing that they have a Starbucks right inside... Except the prices are doubled. 

Casino isn't my favorite... And the Gillys bar looks a bit... Downgraded.

The hotel is nice, doesn't look like an old hotel. The bed is nice and comfortable, the interior is luxurious, the TV is flat screen (unlike Paris' that has old TV; bulky and has antennas!), and the bathroom is nice and looks elegant!

The only reason why I give 4 stars instead of 5 is their Buffet. They don't offer a lot of variety of food, and their food aren't that good, but they do offer a pretty good deal for it; 2 people for a price of one. Not bad, but there are other hotels' buffets that offer better food.

There are some scantily clad women, muscular men, and Spears\/Aguilera\/Destiny style music sung on headphone mics with a lot of booty shaking.  We were bummed that the pirates were such sissies.  The Treasure Island itself has a Canter's Fairfax (of Los Angeles) outpost on the ground floor.  Its decor is crazy Jetsons style, but the food is comparable to the original Canter's deli.  It's hard to find good, homely food in Vegas, but Canter's serves up no-nonsense pastrami sandwiches and matzo ball soup.

Had ants in our bed and all over the wall\/headboard of our first room.  I totally understand that things happen but, it's the way the hotel handled it that is most disturbing.  We had two separate reservations.  One for Friday\/Saturday night and one for Sunday night.  After moving us to a new room, on Sunday morning they knocked on our door and then let themselves in to tell us that we needed to check out?  Then they checked and realized that they had made a mistake.  Gee thanks, now we're all awake!  Then later on Sunday my key quit working.  When I went to the desk they told me that my key wasn't working because I hadn't come to the desk at 4pm to get a new one.  Problem is, nobody told me that I would have to do that.  Basically instead of apologizing for any of the inconveniences that we experienced, they tried to explain to me how it was my fault.

They did offer us a late chekout for our troubles, but I explained that we were leaving first thing in the morning so that wasn't really something we were interested in.  With the prices of drinks at TI you would expect a little bit better customer service.  If I'm paying high prices I at least expect to be treated well.

- The king sized bed was about the most comfortable mattress I've ever laid on.  It really did help relieve the wear and tear Vegas will put on you from all of the walking.

Cons:
- Immediately they charge a $22\/night fee for nonsense that other Vegas hotels give for free (such as Luxor).  They are services I had no use for, and you can't decline them.
- As if that fee wasn't enough, they charge a $100\/night suite fee which is given back at the conclusion of your trip pending no damage to the room.  If you have a credit card it will simply show as pending.  I'm a guy who only carries a debit card though, so they had to take $400 out of my account which can be ""posted back to my account 2-5 business days after checkout"".  I had budgeted $500 for Vegas, and within seconds I had $467 missing from my bank account that I expected to go towards food, drinks, and gambling.
- The ""petite suite"" that I was sharing with my girlfriend was supposed to be a romantic getaway.  The allure of the room was the ""whirlpool tub"".  My expectations going in were low (assumed a bathtub with a couple jets), but they should have been even lower.  It was simply a bathtub.
- The pool is a joke.  When you go to Vegas you always envision some luxurious, tropical pool.  Caesar's Palace has massive columns, Mandalay Bay has a wave pool, Rio has multiple islands, Luxor has this crazy quad pool connected around a mini-pyramid.  What does a place title ""Treasure Island"" have?  Just a pool with a bajillion pool chairs around it.  It's small, overcrowded, and is only open from 8 am to 8 pm. 

Conclusion:
Go to Luxor (or any place other than TI).  It costs less initially, there are no hidden fees, the rooms are just as nice, and you'll have a better experience.  If it wasn't for the bed this place would get one-star from me.",0,0,0

We booked our reservation through one of their reservation agents and chose to stay their because their wedding packages were affordable. We booked a NON SMOKING Tower Suite and the two adjoining rooms next to it. I reconfirmed a few days prior to our arrival. The weekend we were there was the EDC music festival (Google ""Electric Daisy Carnival"" and you'll understand what we had to deal with). We were prepared that it would be nuts in Vegas. As a ""courtesy"" they opened up check in at 1pm instead of 3pm only to find out later they CHARGED us $25 for ""early check in"" (we called after we got home and had it removed). At check in ""Evelyn"" informed us that we had smoking rooms. We told her that we needed nonsmoking. She said, ""That is a request not a guarantee"".  We tried to explain to her that we were having our wedding there and that we were told by the reservation agent that we would get nonsmoking for all three rooms. Evelyn offered to waive one day of the resort fee ($25) for the inconvenience of having a smoking room (we stayed 5 days).  We went round and round with her for 20 minutes and her response was the same: ""That is a request not a guarantee"". At this point I said, ""I'm getting married here. I chose YOUR hotel to have my wedding and we have guests traveling to stay in those rooms."" Her response: ""We have over 1600 people here this weekend."" During this entire exchange my husband and I remained calm and courteous despite our anger and frustration at the situation. We did not yell, swear or disparage Evelyn.  My husband asked for a manager and she said, ""I'll get her but she's with another guest so you will have to step aside and wait for her."" As my husband was speaking to her and calmly expressing our frustration Evelyn was running her tongue along her front teeth, looking at her computer monitor and messing with her hair. My husband knew that she had crossed a line with me and knew I was about to lose it, so he sent me out into the lobby to calm down.  Later, my husband tells me that while waiting for the manager she told him that ""only my manager can make these changes."" If that were the case, why did she not offer the manager in the first place? When the manager finally comes over, she was courteous, professional  and had been working on resolving our situation. Evelyn never told us that the manager not only knew what we were complaining about but that she was actually working on resolving the situation. The entire check in process took 45 minutes. I'm only giving TI a ""3"" because our introduction tainted our entire experience at TI and had it not been the fact that our wedding was there and the EDC festival had booked up Vegas, we would have left. We encountered two other awful employees: a snotty waitress in the Breeze bar and the rude man running the TI Bling shop (we had forgotten the cuff links and he tried to sell us a pair of $100 sterling silver ones. We went to Macy's instead and got a pair for $50). Since we had friends in for our wedding we tried to get tables in the different restaurants for all of us to be together. Kahunaville, the Breeze Bar, and Gilley's BBQ each asked for a credit card for the entire group if it was over 8. That was a very frustrating request. 

With all of that being said: Our Tower Suite was wonderful and large enough to have our reception in it (30 guests). We each had our own bathrooms large enough to get ready for the wedding in. Other than those encounters, the rest of the employees were pleasant, helpful and accommodating. 

It's unfortunate that some of our experiences were so extreme they did not outweigh the good experiences.  I probably will not stay here again.

The room, a petite suite, was amazing and super clean and classy! I loved it! It was massive and worked well as a mini reception area for my wedding party! Also, the food from room service was to die for! We enjoyed the jet tub and the big shower. They have great black out drapes too! The parking is free which is great! Something I really liked was that they have someone checking room keys at the elevators to make sure you're not just a stranger going up which makes it a bit safer and set my mind at ease!

My parents were upgraded to a petite suite like ours and they were really happy with it! The service was great from the bell desk, check in, chapel, and valet. Everyone is friendly and attentive too!

I would recommend to my friends and family for sure!",2,0,0

I've stayed at Mandalay and Wynn before and I love ti the best. At the wynn, the service people seem like they have a stick up their butt. Upon check-in at TI, I slipped the girl a few bucks and chit-chatted with her a few. She was the nicest hotel checkin person ever. She also asked me what kind of room I wanted (but my brother wanted two beds so we took the deluxe not the suite) and hooked us up with strip view and a bottle of bubbly. A+ for going beyond. The room was so much better than I expected. The beds were comfy, the bathroom was clean, the view was amazing, and there was an ipod dock. Definitely a good hookup esp because she tried to get us the highest room she could. +1 for the tram to the mirage and the siren show. The only part I hated was the lack of workers in certain departments. We waited an hour to pick up mystere tickets because only one worker was on willcall. The pick up took literally 10 seconds but the line was 1 hour. Remember to buy your hotel the week of because the prices are dirt cheap.",1,0,1

My spouse and I visit Vegas every year for a week to enjoy warmer than Alaska weather and do some easy hiking, eating and sleeping in excess .

The good :
The beds......5 stars. 
The hot water and water pressure.....5 stars. 
Customer service 5 stars, especially SYD , the bartender\/waiter in the seafood shack.
Ease of getting in\/out of the hotel and parking garage 4.5stars. 
Seafood grill 5 star food. 

Air quality in the room. 1-5 stars. 
Well it varied. 
If the air is off and the window vent open. It's pretty good for this non smoker. So the time of year allowed me to just leave the hotel air off. 

I suspect in the summer. You'll have to endure the constantly changing brands , intensity of cig smoke coming from the air conditioner.  
I'm not going to review negatively on the air in the hotel. 
I knew going into the deal it was a given.  
Having stayed at 4 casinos so far , for our winter hike ,eat ,sleep getaway , t.i. Has been the least smoky. 

It's the best bang for the buck in my opinion. 

Between the room quality , hot water, service, and food sophistication , treasure island is hard to beat. 

And I did throw some coins in a machine when the air was cleaner.  ( not the weekend)

Called to confirm the reservation with TI and was surprised to learn there was a 25.00 resort fee. After finding this out I called price line to voice my opinion which was nothing short of a joke (calls are transferred to the Philippians after a certain time, who basically say they can not help you and write a letter to corporate). Anyways, I was very upset to find out about this fee since several other nice hotels do not charge any resort fee. Called TI again and spoke to the front desk, little did I know if you book through price line the resort fee IS OPTIONAL. In fact when I checked in they didn't even need my credit card or a deposit for security. I stayed at TI for two nights then off to the Palazzo for one night, since I had a comp night there. In comparison of course the Palazzo was way up there and TI was just okay but all in all I very much enjoyed my stay at TI. 

I liked our room. It even had a cold mini fridge to keep our stuff in. A plasma tv, nice bathroom area. I am not sure why people find it hard to get to the elevators. It is very simple once you check in to go to the elevator to get to your room, no issues there. The tram comes to TI and connects with Mirage, which was very nice.

There was ALOT of noise at night because of the show that is put on if you have a strip view room. However on the plus side my child very much enjoyed seeing the fireworks go off at night for the show from our room. 

We very much enjoyed the pool. Music was playing, but not too loud and crazy. Didn't have to fight for a seat like at Mandalay Bay or Venetian, and it was about 112 degrees outside when we went. 

The casino was nice. Smaller than some resort hotels but it was nice.

I honestly don't really have any complaints about TI and would defiantly stay here again.  Come on 109.00 included taxes out the door for two nights on the strip in Vegas, not too shabby.",0,0,0

After the excruciating process of finding a parking space we stepped from our Prius into the excruciating, and miserable, heat. Unloading our modest amount or luggage we unknowingly began our journey to the TI lobby. We rush into the air conditioned block of elevators adjacent to the parking garage and hit the glowing brick that says 'casino\/hotel'. The ding announces our arrival. We exit and look down an unfamiliar and unmarked hallway. I turn to my partner, ""is this the way?"" His response, ""I believe it is the only way."" We take a step towards our inevitable doom towards the clatter and commotion of the intoxicated arcade. We come across a set of escalators downward to the gates of hell it seems, but no the sign disagrees stating, 'hotel\/casino' once again. I turn and hesitate, we continue on. Once at the base we are surrounded by merchandise and flyer flickers pleading for our attention, ""NO!"" We manage to mumble, ""we just want to set down our things and take refuge before facing death."" They refuse our pleas. We walk for minutes that seem like hours, ""which way?!"" Do we really have to walk through this mini-mall to get to out hotel lobby?! It was right there?! Or so we thought. Finally after confused wandering, we found ourselves at the back of the line for the TI check-in. How we managed to find it, I still cannot recall. Honestly, what is the point of hiding the check-in? As I carry my luggage to the elevators towards our room I wonder, ""do they really think I will stick in a few dollars as I make my way to the front desk? With what free hand? And if the reason for this labyrinth is to punish me for the sin that is self-parking, success. True success TI. Excruciating failure, but your brilliant success.""

The rooms were fairly clean. I scanned our bedding with my black light flashlight and found a strange mystery spot on the comforter and promptly kicked that blanket off the bed for the duration of our stay.

The bathroom was a nice size. The fixtures were alittle run down: an outlet's faceplate was cracked, the handle of the sink came off in my hand, and the shower head needed cleaning. Everything else seemed fine.

Our room faced the strip and i wasn't too happy about having to hear the Sirens of TI show while i was trying to nap. Too many booms, explosions, and singing. 

The pizza place inside TI is two star at best. Over priced for what you get and i've had better pizza from a street cart.

The tiki bar inside TI is interesting to check out for an hour (not a place to end your night). We stopped by on a friday at 11 when their bartender contest was going on. Our side of the bar won the ""who's the loudest"" contest and everyone rushed to the bar to have free booze poured into their mouths (NO GERMS FOR ME THANKS).

I had trouble deciding between the Mirage, where our friends were staying and TI, where I found a special for $80 less a night.

My gut is usually never wrong and this case was definitely no different.

Our view out the window of the strip was incredible. We saw it light up all the way down each night and it was way cooler to look at then to be around. (:

I loved our room. It had the most comfortable hotel bed with the best pillows and linens EVER. The blankets weighed 552 pounds and crushed you to death when you laid under them and it was excellent!

The TI Wet Spa products were also really nice. Smelled amazing.

The fact that there is a tram over to the Mirage proved to definitely be an extreme score with how often we were going back and forth between rooms.

The casino part is honestly just like every other I believe. I didnt care to spend too much time around the smoke and money pit foolishness.

Driving up and down the strip can be quite a nightmare, luckily the parking lot for TI is right off the 15.  There is no need to deal with any of that annoying car and foot traffic.  Furthermore, you can side street it to any of the hotels on the west side of the Strip again with no traffic or hassle at all via Industrial and Frank Sinatra (easily accessible roads from the TI parking lot).

The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful.  They were even helpful over the phone when I had to call down to have the free wifi fixed for our room.

The hotel itself is in good condition.  Still very clean and looks well kept.  It doesn't have the dingy looking carpet or cracked paint on the walls that you might see at other hotels.  But of course it doesn't even look nearly as nice as the Cosmopolitan or Bellagio either.  Elevators, hallways, rooms, all clean and very well decorated.

Of course, when you get a buy one get one free deal you assume that you will get the worst room but our room was pretty good. We had a view over the road and part of the Fashion Show Mall and were on the 31st floor- I was just hoping that there would be no emergency where we couldnt use the lifts.

The sink was cracked and the room could have done with a little updating but everything else was fine. There was no visible signs of bed bugs which is a good thing as the past couple of years I have had this insane fear of them so had there been any sign we would have been out of there like a shot!

The bed was really comfortable, so comfortable that one night out of our stay we slept a solid 12 hours!

When you check in you get a lot of coupons to get offers- there was one for buy one get one free drinks up to a certain value (I cannot recall whether it was 9 or 11 dollars) however, we were not able to find ANY place in the hotel where we could redeem these.

Additionally the WIFI was not automatically included when you paid the resort fee, even though the card we had said that the resort fee included access to WIFI- I believe what they meant was that whilst you could access the WIFI you had to pay for it.

Upon checking out we forgot to pick up our jackets- we had hung them in the closet and not worn them at all. Given that we live in Southern California we are already used to not having a jacket so it was easy to miss!

We were staying in another hotel nearby for another night so were still in the area.

It was actually a pretty happening hotel at the time. Now, it's a budget hotel with a great location.

Let's face it, the only reason to stay at TI nowadays is for the lower rate and the location. The Wynn\/Encore and Palazzo\/Venetian properties across the street is the main draw here. Although it's right across the street, it's still a 5-10 minute walk to cross over the bridges. If shopping is your thing, the Fashion Mall is right next door. 

Although it was a weekday, it's hard to beat $50 a night for a decent room. BUT, and it's a huge BUT... as with a lot of other properties, they charge a $22 resort fee. It includes the usual stuff like Wi-Fi, gym, newspaper, etc etc. Unless you're cooped up inside the hotel room on business, you won't get your money's worth. I tried to ask nicely to waive the fee upon check-in, but they are dead set.

So if you add it all up, an fabulous deal at $50\/night has morphed into an ""okay"" deal at around $75\/night. I signed up for their mailing list, and seem to be very active promotions--they have plenty of 2 for 1 deals for drinks, their buffet, and some other stuff. They even throw in a voucher for $20 off a future stay.

As for the room, it was good enough for 3-4 hours of sleep. It didn't smell, there were no stains anywhere, and it was clean. I even had a partial view of the Strip, which was a nice surprise. My only gripe was the bathroom. The drain for the shower was extremely slow in draining water (who wants to stand in a pool of their own dirty water?). To top it off, the sink was plugged up too.

Other things to note: water pressure for the showers are great and there's too much water filled in the toilets (I know.. SUPER random, but if you toss tissues in there it's not uncommon to have splash back - YUCK!).",0,0,0

My complaint comes in the ""resort fee"". When I called up Wed night for a Thursday stay no one mentioned a resort fee. The resort fee is a per day fee that is added to everyroom. I do not understand why this fee is not built into the standard room fee. I find it to be deceptive. If the room is worth an additional $20 then add it to the room fee. This type of billing is frustrating and dishonest.",2,0,0

When we checked in (and paid the resort fee, which it looks like all the other reviewers have mentioned) and the man at the check in desk offered to switch us from a room with two queens to one king--which was amazing. 

The ""inept"" part came that night.  At 3am, maid staff came into the room--because our neighbors had called room service. So if you don't want someone waking you up in the middle of the night, don't be ashamed to hang the ""do not disturb"" sign up, and hope for the best. 

The beds are comfortable, the rooms are decently sized (we were pleasantly surprised). The gym (included in your resort fee) was decent. The pool was nice, but crowded, and not particularly child friendly (although if you're with your kids in Las Vegas, racy songs at the pool is probably the least of your concerns). If you're planning on going to the pool, go early to get a chair. 

The bars at TI weren't terrible great, so I recommend heading outside the casino for your drinks, unless you're using the coupons you get given when you pay the resort fee.",2,0,1

But we started out our trip planning in true vegas fashion with a gamble... using priceline.com. We named our own awesome price and decided we 'slum it' in a 4 star instead of 5 in attempts to win big and score a nice-ish hotel for an excellent price. And TI is what we ended up with. I was a little bummed out at first but after our arrival and first night I have to say i was pleasantly surprised.
 It's a great location, close to so many things we wanted to visit. They've done some very nice additions to it over the years and the rooms are really quite good. As the other reviews have stated the beds are very comfy and the pillows are too. Decent sized  bathrooms with mirrors that defog quickly. Good in room mirrors as well so plenty of room to get ready and primp in (when you're married to a model and prepping time can be a competitive sport for the mirror).
When we checked in the front desk girls were dolls and noticed on my ID it was my bday so they immediately upgraded us and we ended up having a fantastic view of the strip and were able to get connecting rooms with our best buds that joined us on the vacation. Rooms are quiet. Housekeeping isn't annoying. Nice stereo to hook the ipod up to. 
The offerings in the casino are bland though and there isn't any type of a hip or posh vibe which is boring. No good restaurants. the mexican restaurant inside was pretty awful service with really bad stafff and hours. And the club - ha - doesn't realy exist as a club, more of just a pretty bar. The buffet was actually decent, the lunch price was a steal - we paid $16 and i although i only had 1plate of mediocre food i definitely drank more than $16 worth of champagne which was included and their dessert bar blew me away. So many items i wanted to try (and did!) I had about 2 plates full of sugary sweets that came in handy with all the champagne i had to wash them down with, mini fresh donuts were my most favorite! 
I popped inside the spa to check out their product lines and the gal that seemed to be in charge was super sweet and friendly even though i wasnt getting any services. And the facility was huge and very well decorated it feels alot more high end than the casino itself. Their workout facility was nice as well with bottled waters and towel service. The shuttle to the mirage was very handy since we had tickets to LOVE one night.

We were going as a group and found a great deal at TI. It was my first time staying here but the price was hard to beat.

I've read complaints of long waits when checking in, this was not at all the case for us. We arrived at 2:00pm on Friday, there were around 7 clerks and we were checked in under 15 mins.

We booked the standard room but I did the $20 trick  (slip a $20 under your ID or between the credit card and ID and ask for something with a ""nice view"", I've always gotten upgrades this way) on the registration clerk and got upgraded to the top floor with a more spacious room and an awesome view. It also has a separate set of elevators for the higher floors and the top floor(36) requires your room key. So these elevators were never crowded and got us to the room fast every time. 

The room was clean and very nice, although smaller than some of the higher end Hotels, it wasn't cramped. The top floor has vaulted ceilings too which is nice, and we had a great view of the pool and the strip. The bed was very comfortable and the and house keeping was very prompt and came at a reasonable time every day ( around 9:30am-10:00am).

The Hotel's location is very convenient, there's a walk way to the fashion show mall and a tram to the Mirage. The pool was very nice, they play music and have a DJ from 12-4pm I believe, and stays open till 8:00pm during the summer.

We ate at the Pho restaurant and it was pretty good, nothing better than pho when you're drunk and or hung over. The buffet was ok for the price, they had soul food which wasn't bad. The selection wasn't bad for brunch but not as extensive as some of the other Vegas buffets, the Wynn is probably the best buffet in Vegas IMO.

The Hotel Gym itself is pretty good for a Hotel Gym, treadmills, machines free weights, everything you need to get your last minute yolks on before hitting the strip.

We also checked out the Christian Adu-whatever club, the dress code didn't seem as strict as some others, it was ok, kind of small but you get front row seat at the pirate show, so that's kind of cool.

As mentioned there's a $20 resort fee per room, (it includes, access to the pool, gym, internet ect) a lot of the Hotels on the strip are doing this just be aware it's an extra required charge then what you have already paid, or was quoted on the total of your stay. Sure it's a hassle but if you're going to cry over $20 you probably shouldn't be in Vegas.

Overall for the value, location and amenities, it was well worth the price, I would definitively  stay again.",8,2,3

So I do it online with him, seeing the resort fee, etc. And he tells me that is a part of the total price of the room and that it's still $278.

Oh also they lied about their promotion: 2 for 1 buffet every night you stay....that's the whole reason I called in and trusted the representative (promotion was going to expire on the 24th)...but when I got there they gave me only one night and said I was wrong ...of course their email receipt doesn't state any benefits and they pulled the promotion from their website...

Terrible company, for the price you pay you can get a better experience...TI is just lucky that the expensive hotels were built around them since they are so old and run their Business with lies...

This is a very specific pro, but I really liked their bath soap.  It has bumps on it, so bathing was like getting a silky massage.

Hotel in general: It was... okay.  The casino seemed smoky and not as open as other ones we saw.  The attraction, though (the Sirens of TI show) was a lot of fun.  The one thing that surprised me about the hotel was that they charge a daily service fee of $20.  I take it many Vegas hotels (but not all) do this.

I had to have my passport sent FedEx to me since my license was stolen and TI wanted to charge me a $7.00 handling fee for receiving the package, I told them no way, I'm not paying that. Also, we had a medical situation in front of the Mirage and my friend called TI and asked them to have a cab sent to the front of the Volcano at the Mirage on Las Vegas Blvd. and they refused, they said ""no"", that's the Mirages problem not ours. Terrible service, one evening we saw people filling out security reports in the casino because their wallet was stolen. The hotel itself also does not compare to some of the others, it's outdated, and the layout is terrible, the parking garage is really far from the room elevators and lobby. It's a little lower class as well compared to Caesars, the Wynn and Mirage etc..
Never once did the management call to apologize or compensate us in any way. I would never stay here again or recommend it to anyone.",3,1,0

 We reserved two rooms with two beds. Both rooms got downgraded to a single bed in what they called ""first come first serve"". Yeah, I did say we reserved 2 rooms with 2 beds. We couldn't upgrade, but they sold us cots for 50 each. They kept telling us to come back downstairs every hour or so to see if anything became available, then they told us that it was too late. After I started to get upset when I went down there for the third time the manager threatened to kick us out because we had 4 people in each room when there was only one bed. They then gave us a bottle of champagne for all the trouble, but when I ordered through room service it never came. 
On the first night my phone was stolen out of my room. I can't 100% blame the hotel, but they do lack security. Before noticing the phone missing there was a security guard walking around checking doors so I assume they knew something was happening. After I filed the report I noticed that if you let the door shut without pulling on it it didn't shut and lock. 
There are so many hotels in vegas that are around the same price and will treat you like a high roller.

---

This was my first time at Treasure Island, and was due to a great Groupon deal we received for it, something like $270 for two nights there, a $50 dining credit, and a $50 salon credit.  

We got in at 11pm on a Friday, and stayed until Sunday.  When we were chatting with the woman working at the front desk, we told her about it being our first time at TI, and how excited we were to check it out.  She gave us two complementary buffet coupons, and charged me for the taxes for the weekend (which weren't included in the groupon) and we were on our way.

The room was pretty standard, and had the usual amenities.  However, we went to put some of our stuff in the mini-fridge, and inside, there were leftovers still sitting there, presumably from the previous room occupants.  Not the best start.

The next day, we tried to make our way down to the lobby for lunch, and were stuck because the elevators weren't working.  Whenever we pressed the down button, it would light up for a moment, and then turn off.  After wandering around for a few minutes looking for stairs, we came back to try the elevators again (we were on the 21 floor, and the thought of stairs while hungover was not welcoming), and they finally stopped at the floor.  However, they were on some sort of reset, so we ended up having to go up one floor at a time, to 24, and then one floor at a time back down until we reached the lobby on floor one.

We then go to find out from the cashier at the Buffet, that the complimentary buffet coupons the front desk lady had given us were only valid from Monday - Friday.  So yeah, without giving us the heads up, she gave us vouchers that were useless, KNOWING that we checked in at 11pm on a Friday.  We finally complained to the manager who was nice enough to sign off on the vouchers, as well as give us a third one because there were three people in our party.

At dinner at the Pho Vietnamese place at TI, we had to stress that one of our party members can't have MSG, and got conflicting reports from the hostess and the server about whether the food contained MSG or not.  Thankfully, the server went back to check to see which items on the menu were MSG-free.

At checkout, they of course had forgotten my dining credit, which had to be reapplied, and informed me that they had charged the wrong amount for the room tax when I checked in.  It wasn't much of a price difference, an extra few bucks, but just sort of added to the poor form of the Vegas experience.  

The casino was fine, and had the usual assortment of games. They offer the usual $10 free slot play for signing up for the TI players card, and have a small assortment of shops, etc.  Most of the staff was very friendly, so they get points back there for sure.  

I'm a regular to Vegas, and typically stay at Cosmo, or Aria, and have never had these types of problems there.  The issues by themselves weren't a big deal, but after dealing with one detail after another, you get kind of fed up with it, especially at Vegas where the goal is to take care of people so you throw all your money back gambling in their casinos. 

I don't plan on staying at TI again unless another amazing Groupon deal shows up.  Just too many inconsistencies that you won't find at other places.  If you can, try and find another place to stay.",2,0,0

They should have offered an apology, and give us a time estimate as to when they will have someone up. 10 mins? 15 mins? Not ""soon"".

EVERYTHING PIRATE!!! however.. how were they to compete with all the new upscale ultra luxurious hotels popping up? so the past few years they've been doing major renovation, getting rid of the pirate theme all together and creating a modern sexy hotel on the inside. i can't say they've reached that status yet... but theres still this cozy feeling about treasure island that you dont feel at other hotels. the place isn't too big either so getting from one place to another isn't a hassle. and for those who cant gamble yet... the fashion show mall is right next door! there's a bridge that takes you directly there from TI. awesome shopping!

The hotel has a resort fee which is ridiculous to pay for Wi-Fi this day in age! 

I had my wedding and reception at the hotel...thank God I do not plan on getting married again because it was not an experience to talk about in a good way!  If you plan on getting married, run as fast as you can in the other direction!!!!!!!!

Sadly, your TI wedding coordinator does not even handle the chapel or the actual wedding!  That was odd in itself, but the chapel and catering are two different departments that do not get along nor do they cooperate with each other!  I had 2 different photographers...one for the chapel and one for the reception.  Two different styles of photography and that makes it difficult for your memories and final albums of your special day.

Everything that you are asked if you want is extra!  So the $5,000 package does NOT include the chapel, even though it says it does.  The wedding was basically double the price quoted.  They give you NOTHING for free...not your room, not even your tasting!  It is $60\/per person to taste the food and you do not get the left over food (which there is a lot).  Plus, I felt rushed to eat the food as they were so anxious to take it away!

For the reception, I ordered a photo booth with props.  I noticed that they were not in the photo booth, so halfway through the ceremony they had to run out to get the props.  So the first batch of pictures, no one had props!

We ordered special kids plates at $19.99\/each for the 3 children in attendance, it was supposed to be a meal with juice, a fruit cup, a special dessert and their entrée.  Low and behold, we only received the entrée!  (Which the chicken fingers was 2 chicken fingers only with fries).  After numerous emails saying that was not acceptable, I was finally refunded $10.80!  So they want me to believe that the  cost of juice, a fruit cup and dessert is valued at only $3.60\/per meal and the 2 chicken fingers and fries is valued at $16.39.  Please!

I had several issues arise and the manager never got involved.  I always had to hear from the wedding coordinator second-hand what the manager said!

So many things to say, but the jest of it is here.  Just run!",7,1,1

Definitely different clientele than the Bellagio that I stayed at the last time I was here for fun (4-5 years ago). Yes, there is a $36 \/night resort fee, but that seems to be the standard situation here in Vegas. The only unfortunate thing is that the pool was closed when we were there so not sure why it was so high. Or perhaps that is a discount from the normal summer prices when their pool is open?

Either way, we spent a day shopping at the Fashion Mall (across the street) and Grand Canal Shops in the Venetian. Spent another one walking around, getting a massage, etc. The current display in the lobby is the Avatar S.T.A.T.I.O.N digital museum\/game that was free for us since we stayed here. 

Like someone else mentioned there is a CVS in the hotel that is open 24 hours, a Starbucks right outside of the hotel (also open 24 hours), and several different restaurants; however, we found eating at restaurants outside of this casino\/hotel enabled us to better enjoy the eating experience since here it seems to be extremely full of smoke everywhere!",2,0,0

The Siren show is a must-see, not because it's spectacular, but because you've already paid for it in your reservation, so why not? Entertaining. A bit cheesy. But mildly enjoyable.

Between how quiet the room was and the black-out curtain, there was no way to know we were on the strip. It was fantastic. Our room had a tiny fridge, safe, iron, ironing board, and a TV. We used everything but the TV (who goes to Vegas to watch TV in their hotel room?). The beds were comfy despite feather pillows (I haaaaate feather pillows) and the bedding was decent. I like giant comforters and our room had the sheet and a thin blanket. Still warm enough, but lacking in the cosy, human burrito department. A\/C was controllable. The bathroom was pretty big. We often had three adults in there getting ready and soaking our feet in the tub. 

Checking in was super easy. It was the first time I had ever checked into a hotel so I'm glad it was an easy process. We checked in after 10pm and there was no line. Checking out was even easier and we got to keep the key cards (they're Mystere-themed)! We checked out just before 11am and there were only a couple of people in line ahead of us. There are plenty of gift shops throughout the main floor and a bunch of restaurants\/bars. We didn't eat at any of them but they always had a decent amount of people in them. The gambling part of the floor looked like all the other casinos - we weren't there to gamble, so I really have no opinion on that part. When we checked out, the hotel held our luggage for free for us until our flight. The employee who grabbed our luggage out of storage also got us a taxi ahead of all the people waiting in the taxi line-up. That was awesome (it was a long line).

Location-wise, I loved being at the edge of the busy part of the strip. We could (and did) easily walk from TI down to Excalibur. TI is across the street via overhead walkway from the Fashion Show mall and the Venetian. There's a tram that connects to the Mirage, but honestly, the hotels are so close to each other you can walk. TI is also the home of Cirque du Soleil's Mystere. We saw the show and it was amazing. Words can not describe the magic of this show. I 110% recommend seeing Mystere if you're staying at TI!

We got our car from valet and there was damage to our door and it wouldnt close and somehow the screws were missing??? And the handle was broken. ""They said it was like that when they went to park it"" but yet 45 minutes before that we had to get something out of the car so they to bring it up and re park it again since we didnt need go go anywhere.

The hotel is aging, and it's starting to show.  The bars, restaurants, casino were pretty dead when we went.  I remember going to play craps at around 12am and there were only around 3 other people playing craps in the whole casino.  I like gambling close to the room while the gf sleeps, so I was disappointed.

Our room was very nice, and we were upgraded to a top floor corner room for no additional cost.  We also got a good deal which included a 50$ comp with our room.  We used our comp for one meal at their version of Canters (which was awesome) and the rest at their pho place [which was basically like normal pho at twice the cost, but good since you can play keno and eat pho at the same time ;) ]

We are late sleepers, and we had some issues with housekeeping coming to our room around 10am, skipping us, and then not coming back.  It sucks leaving around 3pm and getting back after a long night to a non-made up bed.  Housekeeping is really one of the best parts about staying at a hotel, so that really irked me.

When we arrived, we were told that only smoking rooms on smoking floors were available. The entire party (we booked several rooms) registered displeasure with this but we were told there were no other options. Period. The manager assured us that it would be barely noticeable. Well, as you can imagine, when we stepped onto the tenth floor, we virtually needed an oxygen mask. The odor was strong enough to be revolting. Later that night, the smell of weed was so over-powering that we elected to hit The Strip a bit early rather than rest. The next day, we all requested a room-change and reported the weed stench (which management made a note of and indicated that security would investigate). We were promptly moved. However, when we arrived in our new room and opened our luggage, everything reeked of smoke. (Right now, our suitcases are open in the foyer in an attempt to air them out ... still, we are concerned we may have to dispose of it). Our clothes, of course, can be washed. (We picked up ""Tide with Frebreze,"" so that should help). 

Now, please note that the door to the rooms need to be pulled sharply closed. (This applied to all rooms). Be SUPER vigilant of this. One of the folks in our party TWICE forgot to pull the door sharply closed and was lucky that no one robbed her. (Also, watch for the privacy tags, these can block the door from closing also). 

Keep an eye on the fine print. I cannot emphasize this enough. You receive internet service in the resort fee ($28.00 a day ... no exceptions for anyone). HOWEVER, this is for ONE device. Therefore, if you and your boyfriend\/girlfriend each have a device, it is an additional $19.99 a day. If you add your phone, an additional $19.99 a day. This is NOT entirely noticeable ... it is in the fine-print, and we were lucky enough to notice it. 

We were excited to have a mini-fridge since we wanted to buy some pastries at Bouchon for the morning. However, the odor was unreal. This fridge went unused. 

The crowd who seems to frequent this hotel is a ""little rough."" So keep a close eye on your belongings. (We had several awkward elevator rides with some truly stoned and shady characters .... two of whom appeared indigent). This is not a Wynn, Bellagio, or Four Seasons.

Finally, if you book this hotel with the promise of amenities, print that screen. When we arrived, we were not given our two-per-room free buffet vouchers. We were told that was not an option. When I explained that it was a part of the package, the girl checking us in said it was not and asked for proof. I asked her how I could prove it ... she requested a screen-shot (LOL!) or a print out. I had to be ""that person"" and request a manager who gave us the comps ""as a favor to us."" (Double LOL!)

Note: there is no concierge at this hotel. So if you need show-tickets, they will try to get you to visit the individual casinos. What a waste of time. Instead, just call the casino and then they will direct you to a sister-casino to pick up the tickets. For example, some of us wanted to see Carrot Top, so we called the Luxor and then were permitted to pick up tickets as The Mirage ... one casino north). Other resorts we have frequented have a concierge who will get tickets for a party. These are not people who place the customer first.

Book this hotel with extreme caution.",1,0,0

We arrived at 1:00 p.m. for early check in, which was no problem. Our room had two queen size beds, smaller TV, mini fridge and a pretty decent sized bathroom. We also had a great view of the strip.

The second morning, our toilet over flowed for (apparently) no reason. We immediately alerted the front desk and a staff member came up right away and fixed it. He alerted housekeeping and they came and cleaned everything up, gave us fresh towels and so on. Awesome response time- very impressed!

The last night, three things happened:
#1: came home from dinner and found a VERY LARGE cockroach chilling in our bathroom. We scooted him out of our room, after screeching like little girls. 
#2: while getting ready for bed, a man used his key in our door and, to my surprise, it opened! My friend was in the shower and I was half naked, so it was quite a shock. 
3#: our friend the cockroach came back! The space between the door and the floor is large and so he had no problem sneaking back into our room. 

We had a bit of trouble checking out; the automated TV service wasn't responding and it was stuck on Spanish. We had to go down to the desks to check out (which I've never had to do but whatever.)

2 stars are just for the fact that Kahunaville is located inside TI. Kahunaville is becoming my favorite bar in Vegas. Also conveniently located in TI is a Starbucks, for that morning pick me up.

It's centrally located amongst the nice ""newer"" hotels such as Venetian, Palazzo, Wynn, Encore, and right next to Fashion Show Mall. Also, I feel this section of the strip is cleaner than the other end near MGM, excluding the City Center area.

Based on location for the good clubs, it's nice to be near them without having to pay an arm and leg compared to Wynn\/Encore and Venetian. But at the same time it's not dingy hotel rooms or old like Flamingo or Harrahs. You can find rooms at TI for $79\/night during off peak season. 

I like being near Fashion Show Mall for the restaurants, shopping and quick snacks\/gifts at the ABC store, then there's also the Half Off Ticket kiosk there too. Then for clubs that are nearby are TAO in Venetian, XS at Encore which are the two top hottest clubs in Vegas. 

Also for gambling purposes, it's on the lower side for table minimums compared to Wynn, Encore and Venetian. It also has different games like WAR, how awesom is that?! haha. It's not as cheap as probably going to Harrahs or Flamingo but it also doesn't reak of smoke everywhere. Definitely way cleaner. 

The only restaurant I've eaten here is the ""Coffee Shop"", it's like a casual dining -Coco's type or higher end Dennys restaurant. My husband and I love going here because they give you hearty portions, lots of options and they serve breakfast ALL day long! Which he loves their omelette scramble. 

One downside is I went here for my bachelorette party, and their suites all have 1 BED only. They don't have 2 bed suites at TI, like Venetian does. So it was a giant suite with 1 tiny queen (maybe a king?) bed. Also the doors on the suite were not sound-proofed at all, we could hear all the noise from the hallway. You'd think with suites they would sound proof it and make it as grandeur as possible. They need to fix that and would gain a lot more big groups of people staying in their suites like Venetian does. 

Also another ""bonus"" is the Sirens of TI show right in front of the hotel. It replaced the pirate show, and now they're trying to get out of the ""family-friendly reputation"" so they put a ""sexy"" show. It's tacky, but it's free. It's just lots of skimpy-clad women running around putting on a ""pirate"" show. It's amusing to see at least once.",0,0,0

Upon arrival, we had our bags checked and were advised to keep our alcohol with us so we could drink once we got up to the room.  When checking in there was probably (no exaggeration) 60 people standing in line waiting to check in and about 4 people actually checking them in.  We stood in line for about 45 minutes waiting.  That sucked because The Mirage had us in our room within 15 our last visit.

Next, WHAT THE HELL IS THAT SMELL!?!?!?!  When you open any door to enter the casino there is this OVER WHELMING sweet smell that reminds you of your great grandma's perfume.  A hybrid of cleaning product, and the perfume dept for sure.  Yeah, you got used to it after a while, but it was VERY unpleasant walking in each time and getting a nasty whiff of that funky smell.

When we got into our room we had a view of the strip and the pool....It was Ok.  Nothing special.  Especially when looking at the tops of 2 parking garages.  I would've rather had a view of the pirate show personally. The room appeared clean upon entering, but once we started getting settled in we found that there was cigarette ashes all over the dresser and the glasses in the room were not exactly clean.  The bed was AWESOME!! Very comfortable.  Probably the only plus to this room.

Next thing that sucked ass?  The elevators.  OHHH my lord....who's the dick head that came up with this system?  You have to enter the elevator and then insert your room card into a slot and press the floor you want.  SOUNDS SIMPLE RIGHT?  Well it would be simple if it actually worked!!  We found out that one of the slots were actually broken, so that explains the 5 minutes trying to select our floor.  Then we find a slot that works, and you have to insert the key....press the floor number....then slowly remove the card.  Not only was this a PAIN IN THE ASS when we were drunk trying to get back to the room, but we probably helped 4 other couples through the course of our stay get to the floor they wanted.  And the elevators were dirty.  There were rose petals in one of the elevators that had been stepped on numerous times and were smashed into the floor smearing reddish colors all over the floor.  NORMALLY I wouldn't give a damn, but when it's STILL there 3 days later???  Makes you wonder how efficient the cleaning crew is.

The daily 22.40 resort fee?? Please....It's not worth it. I prefer to check out and owe NO money unless I paid for room service or dry cleaning.  I knew there was a resort fee, but didn't realize it was a DAILY fee.  If the Mirage doesn't need to charge daily, why does the T.I.??  Only reason I keep comparing to The Mirage is because that was our 1st stay when we 1st came to Vegas and it was nothing but awesome with no daily fee, no funky smells, clean rooms and great service.  Treasure Island lacked on all of these categories.

Next time we're going to be aiming for something like PH, or Mandalay Bay...Close to where we wanna be, and looks like a blast.  I cant wait for our next visit .......to Vegas that is :)",5,4,2

That's really the only thing this room was missing. 

I was able to check out the pool on Saturday and it was packed, no where to sit and there isn't any shade unless you have a cabana. The pool is also smaller compared to other hotels I've stayed at on the strip. 

As far as clubs or places to hangout this hotel doesn't offer it. But it is walking distance to the mall and other hotels are really easy to access.

The front desk representative was knowledgable and friendly. We were upgraded to an Executive King Suite without a charge. I'm not sure if this is customary but it was a nice gesture on behalf of the hotel.

We were in a hurry to get to a wedding and didn't have time to take pictures. The room had 2 bathrooms. The bathrooms were on each side of the huge entryway. One bathroom had a jet tub, sink, and toilet. The second bathroom had a walk in shower, sink, and toilet.  The room had a sitting area with a generous sized red couch with a tv. The bed was separated by glazed glass. 

They could've done better with the tv sizes. I don't think they were more than 32"". With the room the size it was, it seems a larger tv would look better.

The room was lacking in snacks and bottled water. I'll pay any fee for a bottle of water in the middle of the night. The view was pretty with the strip at night but the window was small. That room would be great with floor to ceiling window view.",0,0,0

The room was clean and well stocked. 

First... I went to flip on the light in bathroom and cut my finger on the switch plate. The hard plastic was broken into pieces and the pieces had been fitted back into the switch plate cover. I dislodged them when I cut my finger, proceeded to stop the bleeding, collected all the pieces, wrapped them neatly in a tissue and took them to the front desk in the morning. The manager was unimpressed with my situation and said that someone would go up to look into it. When I arrived back in my room for the evening, my switch plate was still missing pieces.  It was not fixed during my stay.

Next... There is this little, sliding mechanism that opens and closes the window about an inch. This thing would not stay closed,  It was WINDY outside and I love the sound of the wind, but it sounded like a wind tunnel. This was not my only gripe.

Finally... I have stupid food allergies and something on their approved list made me super sick. I only ate at their establishment while in Vegas because I was so afraid of eating anywhere else and getting sick. Oh well...  On a plus side... their staff was so helpful in trying to find me safe foods, I really really appreciate their efforts. The kind lady in the salad area of the buffet was wonderful and very helpful.

I'm really sad to leave a 2 star for them and will return again... not to be critical, but to enjoy the time that I know TI is worthy of providing.",3,0,0

Reading these subpar reviews left me skeptical with booking the TI. Gave it a shot, and it was overall a good experience. If you are looking for upper echelon room standards, then go blow your money at the venetian or the Wynn. As long as the hotel is clean, when in Vegas, you should only really be in it for sleeping, showering and pre-gaming. The check in process was super smooth. Paid the extra $35 for early checkin since flight was arriving at 10am. Got to the hotel and the girl noticed it was my birthday week, and waved the fee and also offered a free bottle of champagne for the room. She also upgraded the room for us. Room was a corner room, facing the strip. It was clean and stocked. Stayed on the 17th floor, which was quiet. Also smelled as if they just replaced the carpets, it had that new carpet smell which was nice. Wasn't really in the room that much in the 7 days, but when we were there, it was quiet. Housekeeping was pleasant and respectful. Just one day, we noticed they didn't put a new roll of toilet paper on! No big deal, called and asked and they were up in no time with a roll. Pool was nice. Friday and Saturday, get down there by 830am for a chair. It fills up super quick. Rest of week we were able to get a chair anytime of the day. Tuesday they were doing some commercial or film shoot at the pool which was super annoying. Gaming was fine, standard games and slots.Having a CVS attached was great and convenient! We checked out the Drag Queen brunch at Señor Frogs on Sunday, was worth it. Had a great time, totally worth it. All in all, would definitely book again at the TI. Don't let the 1 or 2 star reviews fool you, it's really not as bad as many people make it sound.",0,0,1

Ideally good customer care will want to help out customers seeing that they have a HUGE hotel with so many rooms. We checked in on a Wednesday night .. okay I understand Vegas can be busy any day but a good customer service is ""accommodative"" to its customers to display good customer service. 
But this place was completely UNHELPFUL and showed us no interest in helping us out with any sort of upgrade or room change. We infact had 2 rooms booked and we are a returning customer. 
Definitely not coming back after such a unfriendly and unaccomodative behavior. We certainly have more nicer hotels to visit in Vegas ... Treasure Island is the not the only hotel to stay in Vegas.

the walk from the lobby to our elevators was pleasant.  easy to navigate (even though i HATE walking through the casino with all of my luggage and shit in tow) and not too far.  vegas vacation anyone?  ""in order to get to your rooms, you're going to have to go this way through the casino.  veer to the left and make a short right at the first giant palm tree.  you'll see a group of blackjack tables.  not baccarat.  not craps.  blackjack.  take another right and then wind around to the left.  if you get to the pool you've gone too far.  back up and make another right.  you'll see a bank of elevators.  those aren't your elevators.  stay away from them but keep walking, you'll see another bank of elevators..... the gold elevators.  those are yours. take them up to the tenth floor, make a right, at the end of the hallway you'll find your rooms.  any questions?""  ok i know that was totally a huge tangent but that is seriously what happens to me EVERY TIME I GO TO VEGAS.  i always spend the first twenty minutes at the hotel trying to get from the lobby to my room and like i said before, i hate carting all of my shit through the casino.  anyway....... that didn't happen at TI.  awesome.

got to the room and we could have sworn no one had ever even stayed in it before.  it seriously looked (and smelled) brand new.  like a model home.  SUPER NICE first impression, especially considering it was a smoking room.  everything was very modern and up to date, as far as style is concerned.  not that it really matters.  also, the bed was really really comfortable.  made for great sleeping\/hangovering.

can't say that we ever ate at any of the restaurants at treasure island.  there was a starbucks and a krispy kreme, which ruled.  we DID get room service a few times, which was delicious.  the people who dropped it off were always very pleasant.

i would definitely stay at treasure island again and recommend it to my friends.",1,1,1

I found the food at the pho restaurant to be about a 4 which was the first stop I made. It was a little busy and the other customers there were quite drunk and hilarious. The atmosphere definitely kicked off a great vacation. The servings were large and very tasty.
The hotel portion of the casino would probably receive about 3.5 stars. I was reasonably satisfied with the quality of the room. There were small problems with the bathroom not exactly functioning properly but it wasn't bad. I found the bed comfortable and our view was excellent. I got a room with a corner view with floor to ceiling widows that looked out over the strip. It was a little bit noisy but that's to be expected in Vegas and it didn't bother me one bit since by the time I got back to my room each night, I was pretty much knocked out. There aren't a whole lot of extras that come with this hotel. I did visit the pool which was fun. They had some pool side games including a hoolahoop competition that I partook in. There's a small bar to one side and rows and rows of pool lounge chairs. It doesn't leave a lot of room for you to really enjoy lying down since it's so cramped, but I suppose it's better than having to fight for a seat.
The casino was below my expectations, about a 2 or 3. They have all your standard games- craps, roulette, poker, etc. I didn't play poker here but the poker room is off on it's own part of the building and is sectioned off with a railing. The main casino games were alright, but they just lacked the atmosphere that other places have going for them. Casinos are supposed to be fun and exciting places and this just wasn't the case, at least when I was there. I found that most people went elsewhere for gaming as well. They could also bear to lower their stakes a tad in some of their games.
The highlight of this place is their pirate show. That is what Treasure Island is known for. It is fun for all ages. I was able to get into the VIP section with my stay at the hotel. It's nice to be able to get up close, but you will get splashed so be careful if you're dressed up!

Its smaller than the other casinos and hotels which for me made it more navigable and friendly. 
The bartenders talk to you. The front desk personnel are responsive. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and clean. The supplied toiletries are high end salon quality.  

Their spa is better than any of the half dizen Ive tried in Atlantic City. I got there an hour before my massage and was able to take a stream, sauna and Jacuzzi time. Fresh fruit, snacks and beverages were supplied. The spa area is quiet and comfortable. The massage was great.

The pool are is very nice as well. Not overwhelmingly big but it is a fun atmosphere.

The line took at least 30 min unhappy about that too. The clerk that helped me out was really nice and made me feel welcomed, very friendly (name is John) and I liked that I got a Free Champagne because it was my birthday and I was in Vegas celebrating it, it was also that fourth of July weekend so it was going to be a crazy weekend.

Positive- Starbucks inside the hotel, CVS right outside, Room was big, bed was soo comfortable, pillows too, doesn't overwhelm you with the smell of smoke (yay), Location is perfect didn't hv to drive at all, Security by the elevators is a plus, room service every day and shower had good water pressure, pool had a DJ and it wasn't as crowded, hotel offers a free tram to The Mirage, the Mall is right next door and

We had the penthouse suite here. Our room was beautifully decorated and looked real crisp. Being an all guys birthday weeknd, we wanted to go all out. As soon as entering the room, we immediately fired up the jacuzzi. And 10 minutes later there was water all over the floor due to my fellow comrade who thinks it's not a problem to cannonball indoors. The staff handled the situation pretty well actually. They hand soaked and air dryed the room while we were out and the room looked handy dandy when we returned that night.

Being a fairly rowdy group, being loud was a given. Things got a little wierd for us two days in. Our room was the first room on the hall we were in, and they actually had a person standing by our room 24\/7. I asked why was this necessary, but the staff all told me they were doing what they were told by the relief and higher class. I'm conviced they were keeping an eye on us.
The pool area was exceptional. I mean, it's not a Wet Republic or Cancun, but it's a decent place to lounge around and sun bathe. The music selection was a hit or miss. Some days it was hopping and popping with an actual DJ, and some days it was like they were playing a radio. The drinks are actually really overpriced, but it is Vegas, so you can't really blame them. Anywho, the crowd here was pretty laid back and it was pretty obvious that everyone was hungover. We had brought a handle of Jameson down with us and had our own personal bar going. This goes against the rules, and the staff gave us a warning, but didn't confiscate the bottle until the second warning, when the bottle was already finished. We had forgotten our swimming wear back in the room, and made the executive decision to jump into the pool in our boxers. We weren't escorted out of the pool area, so i'm assuming this is okay if anyone considers this in the future.

The tables here are cursed, and do not pay out. Go somewhere else. No, but seriously, I had the worst luck on the tables. The cocktail waitresses returned fairly quickly with the water down drinks, and do not return to you if you don't tip them well. 

The restauraunt selection here isn't the best. They have one place here open 24 hours that serves food that any late night diner would. We ate here a couple early mornings, and the food is as good as any drunk person looking for a quick bite would expect. The staff at the said restaurant were a hit and miss. Some were cooperative while others gave us the evil eye. My buddy and I came here one morning after a night of painting the town red, and we actually fell asleep after we ordered our food. After miserably failing to wake us up, the staff stored our food away until we woke up. No, they didn't remake our food, but instead saved it for us. I would've said something to them about giving us food that was not fresh, but during my sleep, I actually lost my phone and one of the employees here found my phone on the floor and returned it to me once I woke up. A truly sincere gesture when in Sin City. The food wasn't that good by the way.

I felt bad for the maid that was in charge of cleaning our room. The pad looked like a tornado flew through it. After the second day I started tipping any houskeeper that passed by our room and showering them with compliments. It was the least I could do. Our room was always clean after we returned from the daily escapades, with the linen being fully stocked and our bathroom presentably clean. Nothing was stolen or taken either. 

We ordered room service to go along with our pregame on one of the nights when we were getting ready. Aside from the aggressive lady that yelled at us because we took to long to order, the food was extroadinary. We ordered a bunch of finger food that cost us an arm and leg, but everyone was neatly wrapped and to my surprise, well prepared and cooked. 

Last but not least, the people in charge of customer service. We had initially asked for a room with a view of the strip, but we also really wanted a smoking room to hot box, but to our dismay, the only smoking room they had, did not have a strip view. So we ended up settling for the view of the not so infamous Trump Tower. My buddy who had initially booked the room, called customer service intoxicated, mind you. He complained to them about the hotel view we had and gave them a bogus story about how he was going to propose tomorrow night and needed a strip view. After speaking to many people he finally had a word with the manager who actually gave us a brand new penthouse with a strip view for our last day there. These people really made our trip memorable and cooperated with all our needs. 

I'm giving this place 4 stars because their are better places to stay at on the strip, but if you're not really trying to go all, this is not a bad hotel. It's also right next to the Wynn and Palazzo.",1,2,1

No, it's not because I've been spoiled staying at other places. In fact, TI is a very nice hotel...piping a warm vanilla scent (eerily reminiscent of a stripper) in their guest room hallways.

The linens in the rooms appeared clean (to the naked eye).  We still made sure to rinse out the glasses as a result of the horror stories you hear about maids using furniture polish to clean them.  TV could have been a tad bigger and the window was very small, effectively shrinking our wonderful strip view.

I wouldn't come back here because of two things:  The astronomical prices of food in the Vietnamese side of their diner and their valet parking.

Diner:  One can argue Hey, it's in a hotel.  It's supposed to be expensive.  I get it...I totally do and that's what I told hubby when we stopped by one evening.  But the more I thought about it, the more unjust it seemed to charge 100% more for a bowl noodles just because it's in a hotel.  Le'ts keep in mind - this is the hotel DINER.  Not some fancy restaurant or gastronomic interpretation of pho.  It's just straight up pho.

Valet:  About 75% of the time we approached the valet desk, there was no one there.  A couple times, there were a few of us, holding our tickets, looking around for who can help bail our cars out of what could potentially be a very sneaky way of perpetrating grand theft auto.  When we checked out, there was consistently about 100 people in the waiting area.  For the 45 minutes that we waited there, I realized there were only 3 VALET GUYS.  (Oh yeah, and no one was taking tickets when I first showed up.).  There would be 5-10 minute lulls when there were NO cars being pulled up.  

The percentage breakdown of why I wouldn't go back to TI is about 30% Diner and 70% Valet.  This might not matter to many people, especially if you're used to just taking taxis but it just seemed like an easily overlooked yet potentially frustrating service deficiency in a hotel.",2,2,1

I had stayed here about 10 years ago and was as impressed with our upgraded room as I was with the Bellagio. When I stayed this February I was not as impressed but here are the good things and you can decide. The rooms are clean, large and updated. This is probably one of the most important things to me in a hotel. I know people say ""I'm just sleeping there"" but your are doing a lot more there than sleeping. I don't want to sleep with creepy crawlies. Although they don't make the beds like they do in the picture, it's much more lackadaisical. It's OK. The bed are comfortable, very comfortable. The cleaning staff were great and friendly. The hotel is in a great location. They had great deals at the bar with good tequila at $5 a shot. OK the not so good stuff. The check in staff, eh, not what they used to be but there was a big line and it went quickly. They had a lot of people in the front. I don't know what they pay these people but I would hope it was enough to get there gear properly cleaned from stains and ironed. They looked kind of shabby. Like its been said before, not a lot to do in the hotel. Couldn't win a thing but hey, its the strip. OK, whats with the girls in bikinis at the tables. It wasn't even attracting anyone. Not trying to be mean but they weren't exactly the bathing beauty types. I mean, if you have to do your job in a bathing suit, and a bad bathing suit at that, you should probably look the part. I'm not even talking so much body type as these girls couldn't even get makeup on or do their hair. It kind of cheapened what I had originally thought of this place. Like the place is getting desperate for players. I just loooooked awaaaayyy. None of the bad things were enough to give a bad review. Again, the rooms were so good it was worth the stay for me. Oh, one more thing. I almost forgot. This kind of pissed me off. They do not have free wi-fi. Jesus Christ! McDonald's has free wi-fi. Still waiting for a call back from billing that had a FULL mailbox. huh? No one can tell me what the resort fee is for? I was on the phone with them for 30 minutes transferred like 7 times.

You can't beat TI's location.  It's in the middle of the strip, central to everything.  The bed was the best thing about the room.  I think it had a tempur pedic top.  So comfy!

The coffee shop, which is open 24 hours (obviously) is good and reasonably priced.  I suggest the hot chocolate, chocolate cake, or the chocolate peanut butter whatever it was.  We took the sweets back to the room and continued to eat them half asleep throughout the night.

Service is also great! We asked for 4 more towels, and a guy came SUPER fast to get them to us. But he gave us like 8 instead AND he was sooo nice! 

The hotel is in a pretty good location because it's across the street from Wynn and Encore. But girls, for your feet's sake I'd definitely recommend taking a taxi to get to the clubs on the other side because the walking distance is a lot longer than it seems.

Resort fee sucks, especially if you aren't taking advantage of most of their amenities.

Decent eateries within the hotel, but definitely not the best around. 

Comfy beds, fridge in the closet, spacious (but don't try to play hide and go seek in the room, it won't work).

We decided on Treasure Island because of its lower price and location on the strip. There are no more shows on the lagoon. No pirates, no sirens, and part of the lagoon has been made into a frog bar. 

I had heard the rooms were upgraded so I figured it would be acceptable. When we got to the room, we found the refrigerator was warm so maintenance brought me a new one. He told me not to put anything in front of the fan or it won't be cold. The only space available was in front of the fan. The refrigerator was so tiny the only thing it could hold was bottled water. The shower curtain was sour, and the maid kept throwing out perfectly good soap just because it was used. I resorted to hiding it.

There was room on top of the refrigerator for a coffee maker but no coffee maker.  A plus was the magnifying makeup mirror in the bathroom, and at least the blow dryer was clean. To me, the bed was too hard, but the pillows were comfortable. The television reception was adequate. I was paying the $30 a night resort fee in part for wifi, which was adequate, but had to be registered every day.

The worst part of Treasure Island is its size. Other casinos are large enough to offer a variety of dining, shopping or entertainment options. Treasure Island's best feature is its close proximity to the strip, a CVS, and the monorail to the Mirage. It's so small, you can walk from one end to the other in five minutes. The Kahunaville restaurant we liked so much is no more. Now it's a bar. The pool is so tiny there's only room for the conventioneers.

My room was no smoking, but the hallway was not. The entire hotel was one big ashtray. It was so crowded, you were forced to literally walk into people with cigarettes. A guard sometimes checked room keys at the elevators, but was mostly absent. One time trying to leave the ground floor elevator corridor, I could not get past the guard because he was holding a woman's drink for her while she looked for her room key. Getting in and out of the hotel was a constant obstacle course.

If you are tempted to take advantage of the discount tickets to Mystere, held in the hotel, save your money. I got discount tickets for the show with our room, but they were so desperate for customers, they discounted them further for others. As Cirque shows go, it was mediocre.

I booked through Priceline and paid about $120 for Friday night on Memorial Day weekend which even for the busy weekend I thought was way too much. This place should by no means be rated a 4-star resort. The check in process was insane - approximately 80 people or more waiting in line to check in and only 3 people working the front desk? We checked in at midnight (went to check in around 7:30 p.m. but the line was way longer so we figured we'd wait it out). Even at the midnight check-in, we didn't get to our room until 1:15 a.m.! I had email TI 4-5 days prior requesting a non-smoking room and since it was my birthday, also inquired as to whether they might have any complimentary upgrades (Aria upgraded us the night prior to a cityview suite for me and my husband's anniversary). TI didn't even bother to respond to my request and said there weren't any non-smoking rooms available when we were finally able to check in and so I was stuck with a disgunting stinky cigarette room with dirty carpet, a dresser with peeling paint and one of the bedside lights was out so it was vampire-dark inside the room. The next day the same room service dinner carts were still sitting there upon check-out at 11 a.m. - disgusting. 
Awful service, awful experience. These pirates definitely robbed me of $120 plus tax and the ridiculous resort fee (and what about the 2 for 1 buffet tickets people are talking about? Those weren't even offered to us!)

The pool was really small, not much place to lounge and swim. The casino doesn't have any fancy shopping, but you don't really needed it since the mall is across the street.

Secondly, there was a wierd morning distrubance, 2 out of the 3 mornings we stayed, there was this loud pipe banging noise, perhaps it was the old stucture of the building. But that wasn't pleasant at all, being waked up every morning at 5\/6am with a scary pipe banging noise, we tried to call the front desk, no answer. 

Also, we tried to order room service after 11pm and they were lack of everything. They didn't have this and ""out of that"" and ""o, we no longer have that"". That's all I heard. What they did have was extremely pricey,  dozen of chicken wings $30, ( Yes, $30 it's not a typo ) and shrimp tempura $46 I believe you get 5. And also for in-room dining they included a $5 per time charge. ( which mades it more expensive) I stayed at Bellaigo before and the in- room dining wasn't that expensive at all compare to TI.

And the coffee shop resturant doesn't allow you to order to-go's you must dine in and ask for to-go box.  All in all TI was a little disappointment, it didn't presented the Vegas Vibe.",1,0,0

First at check in we asked for a price match and the manager didn't bother coming to talk to us and since they already had my money the desk clerk said no and turned around and walked off... RUDE! Next day we rented a motorcycle and did some riding.. Parked in the TI parking garage next to a booth marked security.. Got up the next morning to return the motorcycle and someone had stolen the bags. Security and the hotel were totally dismissive and take No responsibility at all. Went and tried to speak to the manager at the hotel and he told me to call their people that handle that.. Monday-Friday 9-5... And without any shred of compassion turned his back to me and walked away. Cost of room... Almost $600.00. Cost to replace saddlebags stolen in their garage.. $1200.00..

The TI pool was just not for me.  I understand that it's spring break season right now, but I was not in the mood for this frat party.  The dj was spinning loud, cheesy bar music (Sir Mixalot, Journey, Beastie Boys, ,etc.), and announcing stupid contests, like ""Who has the hairiest chest?""  The waitress service was horribly slow, and the pool itself looked pretty gross.  I didn't venture inside, because with all those spring breakers downing beer and seemingly never getting out to relieve themselves- who knows what I would have been getting into.

Although I had to wait for at least 40 minutes for my food to arrive, when it did it was delicious.  I got the chorizo\/beef sliders with cheddar cheese and bacon mayo with shoestring fries.  They were smokey, salty, and irresistable.  My pina colada was alright...a bit watery if you ask me, but my friend's strawberry daquiri was fruity and delicious.

Okay, so besides the pool, TI was very nice.  The beds were really comfy, and the service was good. The location is also pretty ideal.  You can walk to the Wynn\/Encore, Caesar's Palace, The Venetian, and The Mirage, and The Palazzo in 5-10 minutes, which really saves on cabs.  This is definitely one of the nicest bargain hotels on the strip.",1,1,1

Perhaps it's the comped rooms, free gaming chips, and free dining credits. Or it's the good luck streak I've had at the tables, especially with my favorite black jack dealer, Terry. Or maybe even because it's situated on the most happenin' end of the strip. What ever it maybe be, this is my go-to spot.

Even if my TI Players Card didn't get me VIP treatment, it's one of the most reasonably priced hotels in a city that will rob you shamelessly. The pool is nothing spectacular here, but I don't mind the company of a raspberry mango margarita from Kahunaville served poolside. I'm not a fan of most of the dining venues in this hotel, but the buffet is surprisingly not half bad if you're looking for an affordable lunch. (Best part is, they serve cotton candy for dessert!) The newly remodeled rooms are sleek and the beds are extremely comfortable. Though TI's a bit more old fashioned than the recent luxurious additions to the strip, it's a wonderful place to stay, especially when you're playing with a tight budget.

It's a short walk across the bridge from Venetian and right in between Encore\/Wynn and Caesars...

The reason why I stay here a lot is bc if you have a TI players club, they comp rooms like nothing. Free rooms in Vegas?? Why the hell not. Save your money on other things like gambling, food and SHOPPING!

The room itself is decent. I can actually relax and sleep without second guessing myself about how sketchy or gross the room is. It's decently clean inside and the bathroom is actually a decent size. It doesn't feel cramped inside which is okay especially when it's free. Can't complain right??

I think the biggest downfall of TI is the poor selection of restaurants. Nothing good to eat when I stay here. I'm always walking across the street to Venetian or Palazzo for lunch and driving other restaurants for dinner. 

Gambling on the other hand is a hit or miss. I'm a big craps player and the craps table is not that great. Kinda depressing actually. The slot machines on the other hand are realllyy generous and good. If you play it right, you can win pretty big here. 

Overall, this place is okay. If they keep offering the free rooms, I'll stay here with no problems. The best thing about TI is actually their mystere show!!

bed bug bites are disgusting but what I was further disgusted by was the way the employees treated me after I reported the problem (on Christmas Day nontheless!) The woman I spoke with at the front desk pretty much didn't believe me. She told me that it may be an allergic reaction ( I work in a hospital I think I can tell the difference) she wanted to send one of their ""engineers"" to investigate the issue and never offered once to give us a different room. We are on vacation here not to help you play CSI bed bugs. I was finally fed up and asked if we can be switched to a different room while they do their investigating. She flat out told me that they didn't have any ( how is that possible?) and that I would have to call back later to check to see if they had one. This is probably the worst experience I have had at a hotel. Certainly the worst customer service. In a city full of hotels, please save yourself the aggravation and do not stay here.

Oh and their bed bug investigation involved a guy who pulled the sheets off the front of the mattress only and looked at it for 5 sec with a flashlight to deem that he didn't find anything.  Anybody that can google will tell you that bed bugs are nocturnal creatures that hide during the day. Your half ass investigation will not find them. 

I filed a complaint with their risk management department and decided to follow up today to make sure they quarantine the room and prevent the spread to another patron. I was given the run around over the phone and the manager said nothing will be done ( if anything) until the report is filed which will take at least 5 business days. In the mean time they are still renting out that disgusting room. Consider yourself warned and do not stay at 17047.",8,1,1

I get my confirmation email, and it turns out the representative I spoke to mistakenly made my reservation for TONITE (I'm in the southern United States.. I coudn't even make the reservation she booked if I wanted to), not for the three nights in APRIL that we had discussed. To add to that, the rates she quoted me weren't even correct for the dates in April we discussed. 

Upon calling back, I was greeted by another friendly representative who was sympathetic to my situation... but only sympathetic. While he was able to move my reservation to April, he notified me that the booked rooms are nearly DOUBLE what the original representative quoted me. To add to that, he informed me that as my original reservation was for TODAY, I was past the time limit to cancel my reservation for a refund... That's right. They booked me on the wrong day and MY punishment is I no longer have the option to cancel the reservation... Really?

Now I'm stuck with a reservation that, if I had known the proper rates, I would have never booked.

Oh goody. I feel taken advantage of (to say the least), and after seeing their mistake, they did not take care of me or even attempt to make the situation right. 

""Sorry, sometimes mistakes are made"", was the consolation I received. Unbelievable for a hotel on the strip.

It is at a perfect locale for us when we go for day and night. Next to the Fashion Show mall and across from Walgreens for any forgotten necessities. 

ROOMS: We always stay in a 2 queen room, and it's spacious, clean, and the beds are so comfy! The views vary depending on the room, but I liked when we overlooked the TI Boat because we got a fireworks show each night. The strip view rooms are also great because at night everything is lit up and gorgeous. -- They are also currently renovating and adding mini fridges to the rooms. 

STAFF: The staff is friendly and accommodating. During my last stay, we did hit a few bumps and I wasn't pleased with the service when we arrived. But everything was fixed and definitely better above my expectations. 

CASINO: the casino has practically everything you could ask for. If you haven't joined the Players Club at TI yet, you get $5 in free slot play - so definitely do it! I like playing the roulette machines and the poker slot machines. 

BUFFET: The Buffet at TI is yummy. There are many choices to select from from around the world. My favorites are the pasta and salad stations where they make it specific to what you want right there. And the dessert area is awesome! This is the only place i know where i can get cotton candy and mini doughnuts!!! The only thing i would like is prime rib, but maybe I'm there too early and they have it at night. 

EXTRAS: 
Pool \/ Fitness Center: The pool is nice and has a lot of chairs and cabanas. There is also a DJ spinning top 40s for your enjoyment. I went to the fitness center (next to the spa) a couple times and it's adequate. It's not huge, but it has ~10 treadmills with tvs, weights, and other machines. So if you want a basic workout or just to do a little something after the buffet or before you're heading out, stop by and check it out.

While other hotels are peddling their patrons for even more cash (a la the new parking fees), TI is currently still offering ""free"" parking, although the fine print states that parking is included with the resort fees, which aren't any higher than other hotel resort fees so I consider it free parking.  In-room wifi is also included in the resort fee.  They also include a refrigerator in the room, free of charge (unlike a lot of other hotels, which charge $50\/night or more for an in-room fridge. It's a small fridge which holds maybe 2 medium sized carryout boxes, and a couple of ""normal"" sized bottles of water, so keep that in mind before bringing back a bunch of perishable items that may not fit.

The young lady who checked us in during my last visit was very nice and personable.  There was a large line, but she never made us feel rushed. She was amazing!

The standard rooms are decent and comfortable. I like the location of TI, even though it's a nice walk from the south end of the strip. It's close to Fashion Mall and if you're a fan of White Castles it's essentially across the street.  

If possible, come Sunday-Thursday for the best room rates.  If you must travel on a weekend, check their website before booking through a 3rd party.  I was able to find a nice weekend rate during a 4th of July weekend via the hotel's website.  And if you're staying for multiple nights, remember to tip the hardworking room service\/cleaning staff.  

I don't gamble, so I have no advice to that regard. I've never eaten at any of the restaurants inside the hotel, but there are a few from which you can choose.  There are lots of boutiques and specialty shops, but if you're shopping for souvenirs, I suggest going to one of the souvenir shops on the strip where things are much cheaper.

The kicker: Fire Alarm and announcement starts blaring in my room at 330am, it continued to go off for another 45 minutes. It was a false alarm, probably some drunk idiot pulled the alarm. You would think that a Vegas casino would be prepared for events like these. There was no reason to keep the alarm sounding for that long, it woke me up and kept me up. There were no apologies given. Worst experience ever. I do not recommend staying here, id rather stay at the Luxor. Its time for the pirates of TI to blow this POS up.",5,2,1

We stayed on the 36th floor with an amazing view of the strip and mountains. The CVS in the casino is open 24\/7 and it so useful when you wanna tall can or a six pack and save some money or anything else you need. Valet was quick and prompt. Location is fantastic and there is a mall across the street walking distance with over 250 stores. We had an amazing weekend.

Room was fine and as others said, bathroom was a good size.  Other reviews complained about the number of outlets, but there are 4 in the bathroom, if you can make that work.  We paid extra for a strip view and were able to see the pool and pick the right time to head down.  I could also see the volcano show at the Mirage from the room (but couldn't hear much).  I didn't think it was too noisy (from the strip or from inside the hotel).  But I almost subtracted one star for the unthinkable that happened:  the maid completely disregarded the privacy sign on the door handle and came barging in anyway.  While my husband was in the shower and I was getting dressed!!  Luckily I had the extra ""top lock"" locked, but I am still angry about it.  When I expressed my displeasure, she said she was ""checking to see"" if we were in there.  WTF.  

You get coupons to use within the hotel.  I'm sure these change, but ours included 2 or 3 ""buy one, get one"" drinks and 4 buy-one-get-one meals.  The buffet had a lot of options, but the food wasn't very good.  We used the Kahunaville breakfast and dinner coupons and thought it was good.  Didn't get a chance to use the other free dinner coupon for the Seafood Shack, because they open at 5:00 and we were generally on our way by then.

I would stay here again as long as the prices stay low.  I felt they were still a little high for the weeknights that we were there (over $100 for Tues\/Wed nites).

I wouldn't recommend this for kids.  We found drunk people passed out in the floor lobby on Friday morning.",2,2,1

There were no add-ons to my rate. Rather than stay, since they have false advertising, I decided to cancel. After all, it's never good to sit down in a casino when you already feel they are cheating you.  Cancelling the reservation was like an act of God.  1st the uneducated call center operator asked my name, and as soon as I had given it to her, she asked for my last name again.  I told her I had already given it to her.  Then she asked why I was cancelling and I told her it was. the false advertising on their part.  Then she asked for the reservation number. No problem there and then she asked for the last 4 of my credit number. I don't carry cards with me so no can do.  She then says she can't cancel w\/o those 4 digits. BS, they are not needed for cancellation.  When I started to protest she just kept interrupting and interrupting until I threatened her with a lawsuit and she said she would put me through to her supervisor.  After waiting on hold for almost 5 minutes, she came back on to try to see if she could get the price match.  I told her I'm done with them and I was cancelling.  Then she asked why I was getting angry.  Hmm, let's see.  The casino trying to steal my money she's downright rude, why shouldn't I be angry, but I told her it was none of her business.  Then the supervisor comes on and around in circles we go, and she kept rudely interrupting me until I told her to stop for the 3rd time. After I told her I would sue her and the previous operator personally as well as TI with a lawsuit, she cancelled the reservation.  20 minutes of TI lies on the phone and 20 minutes of my time wasted.

No more college-style cramming-into-a-room-and-waking-up-next-to-someone-you-don't-know for me!

The resort fee perks included WiFi in the room, one free pass to the health club, two free buffets (pretty bad buffet), and a 2-for-1 drink coupon (free shot with check-in).   Palazzo and the mall are right next door, and more importantly, the Walgreen's for some last minute party needs.  Mystere is the cheapy Cirque show in TI, which if you've been to Vegas numerous times, you've probably already seen.

The room itself was ""recently remodeled"" and decently slick, fancy, and modern.  However, there were little things amiss - missing ironing board, broken iron, broken closet light in our two rooms.   The previous guests must have had some wild kinky parties with irons and ironing boards in the closet.  That's pretty hard to top, but challenge accepted!

The brown toiletries were nasty - bring your own.

I called the front desk to tell them, they  were polite and even said they would come to the room to give me the door key to my correct room.

The casino was very decent, I'm not a gambler. We enjoyed the Lounge bar frequent it every night for a blue on! We lounged at the pool which was very relaxing, clean & not to crowded. The DJ at the pool played some cool music. We ate at Gilleys which was really good priced decently. We had a blast at Señor Frog, the host there was very entertaining, we had the nachos w\/ guacamole and drank ALOT lol.

We received some coupons at the buffet there and it was surprisingly good. Lots of options, food tasted fresh. 

After all the drinking and eating I actually did get to the gym! It was a good sized gym. All the equipment was clean and in great working condition. And they even offered clean towels, free fruit & water bottles so that was a nice incentive.

Right across from the Palazzo and Venetian with the Wynn, Caesar's Palace, and Encore well within walking distance!

Their computer system was down the day we checked in, which isn't completely their fault...but we stood in line to check in for over an hour and weren't comped a thing. They handed out baby bottles of water and apologized, but we thought they'd at least offer a comped meal or something. When we finally got to our room, our bathroom was still dirty and had no toiletries. They told us room service would be right up to clean t so we could shower and go out for dinner...but they took so long we just left for dinner instead of waiting. Our bed also had no fitted sheet...just a regular sheet over the mattress cover, and the mattress cover was still exposed! So so disappointed. We actually wondered if our room actually got any real attention after the last guests left!

We always visit their little buffet here, which we still like. They have a great selection of fresh pastas and salads that they make for you as you order, along with Mexican, American, and Asian fare! We always get great friendly service, and everything always appears fresh.

We arrived on monday about 1pm and went to see about early check in fees, we were told they were not charging at that time (lobby was pretty empty) so we got checked in. We were on a rewards points offer so room was free and no resort fee. Our room was on the 25th floor looking over the strip, no complaints, room was clean, beds comfortable although the covers are on the thin side. AC worked fine.
The casino is pretty much as stated and could use a make over, food choices are limited as they closed kahunaville and many options are closed by 10pm, they are expensive but so is every restaurant on the strip, if you want cheap food get off strip or head to fremont. Drinks were expensive  and most of the mixed drinks were pretty weak so I stuck to beer for the last few days. 
 The dealers are human and have good and bad days like the rest of us, one gal was having a real attitude so I just moved to something else, next night she was dealing and her table seemed to be party central.
Slots at times seemed pretty good and others were real tight, when we were in Fremont getting a meal one lady told me the off strip slots payout better so we tried it for a while and it certainly seemed true.
We were in Fremont early afternoon and seemed to me it was less sleazy than last year. 
Checkout took all of 2 minutes and no hidden charges.

Since we live in SoCal we come to Vegas often, at least five times a year, and this was our first and last time that we stay here. I understand the hotel is one of the older ones, and things break down faster but still the hotel can be more prepared and manage it better. First, three of the four elevators to our hotel room floor and close by floors broke down on Saturday, and it took over an hour for us to go up to the room to just grab our car keys and come back down. When we called the front desk, we were told that some of the security people will be by the elevator to show people a different way, however there were no security there at the 27th floor,  and it took us over 20 minutes to get an elevator there. Second, we had the privacy sign on our door, since we had some private items out and about the room and we didn't want the house keeping people to go in there while we were gone, however the sign didn't stop them and they still decided to go in and move our things around when we didn't want them to. Third, which might be out of the hotel control, Sunday morning some random person (maybe drunk) was knocking and banging on our room door at 5:00 AM and trying to open the door using their key, till I had to get up out of my bed and confront them. 

During check out, when I informed the desk attendant of our discomfort, they seemed to be very disinterested in what we had to say. Thanks for letting us know that the comfort of your guest isn't a priority.",1,2,0

We had the Tower Suite, it was nice and big but that's where it ended.
The vents were visually clogged with thick dust, pretty gross. 
The suite has a shallow foyer w\/ french door style entry; until 3am we didn't realize the large gap between the floor and bottom of the door.
You hear ALL and any noise from the hallway clearly. General noise of people going to their rooms isn't a big deal at all, but the many groups of 20 somethings who only know one voice level(yelling) becomes quite the issue at 3am.
Aside from the noise I found the staff to be mediocre. The players club desk was just short of rude, dealers were ok, and bar tenders & sports book were along the same route. The staff at Pho restaurant was excellent.

We checked out the next day and went to Paris ito finish the trip; 100% better experience all the way around.

If you're into the club crowd then this probably isn't a bad spot for you. I think TI is achieving what they aimed to do - capture the crowd that's looking to be close to the clubs @ Mirage, etc. It's just not my crowd and top that on the cleanliness & service points and I wouldn't stay here again.",1,0,0

I had read online that if you make a $20 sandwich and ask for a room upgrade, there's a 85% chance of getting it at TI. I booked a basic room and tried it. The lady who checked us in was super nice and said she could upgrade us to a strip view room on the 34th floor. She also put us on the champagne list so we had that delivered to our room.  We were really pleased with that.

 However that night when we got back to our room around 4:30 am, our hallway smelled of vomit and the smell started creeping into our room. When we went to get into the beds,  there was a fresh, unlaundered blood stain on the sheets and what looked like pubic hair. Disgusting! 

I called and asked to switch rooms,  which was a hassle at 5 am,  especially since we had already settled into the room that afternoon. A man came up to our room with a new set of keys for a room on the 35th floor and left.  I'm annoyed that we didn't get a bellhop to help us move our luggage. The new room was clean but the view wasn't as nice and the door lock didn't work well. We had to swipe the key an average of 5 times to get it to open. The toilet was not working properly, which my boyfriend fixed, and the shower drain wouldn't stay open. We decided it wasn't worth switching rooms again. 

When we checked out, the guy was an asshole. He told us he couldn't do anything since we had already gotten free champagne. That was BEFORE we had issues with the room and I did tip the check in lady ($20) and room service ($5) for that, so it's not like I really got that for free. 

I regret being too tired at 5 am to not think clearly enough to take pictures of the nasty sheets to post on my Yelp review.

While there are great reviews about TI on Yelp, my experience leaves me rather disappointed. It should be noted that I visit Las Vegas regularly and I know what level of service to expect from a major resort.

My party and I arrived to find an hour long line at checkin which the hotel was not staffed properly for and when checking in, the hotel did not have the room type booked available and suggested that a rollaway cot can be delivered to the room in 60-90 minutes.

The mandatory resort fee included perks that simply weren't available such as VIP access to the Sirens show which I didn't care for it but don't advertise it as a perk if you are not prepared to deliver.

Our original reservation had us staying two nights and when we decided to inquire whether a third night stay is possible and what rate would be extended to us, the reservation agent simply stated $199\/night. Now, I have been in Vegas enough to know that rack rates are a bunch of bull, especially on a Sunday night during Christmas. I asked again if there is anything they could do on the rate and the agent again stated no.

I took my business across the street to the Venetian at $208\/night and if you have stayed at the Venetian, you know there's a world of difference there. Fast, courteous service from the Venetian but not TI.",0,0,1

Was in Vegas with my best friend and sweetheart for a 4-day weekend. Collectively, our group has stayed in all of the major Vegas hotels: HRH Towers, Venetian, Wynn, Excalibur, RIvera, Aria, Stratosphere, etc..  

We agreed that our stay at the TI made this Vegas vacation one of the most comfotable and convenient of all time. 
Pros:
- The staff was EXCELLENT.  All of our request were met with a quick response and a friendly demeanor.  They bumped up lunch hour just for us when we wanted sliders for breakfast, send the maid back around to accomodate our lazy vacation morning schedule, etc....
- POOL!.  Pool.  POOOOOOL.  Did I say pool?  The pool is small-ish for Vegas but this turned out to be a beautiful thing.  The crowd ranged from tiny babies to older vacationing couples and the staff - including the DJ - made sure there was something for everyone.  If you want to drink and party in the pool, go ahead.  If you want to avoid the jackasses (like us) who want to drink and party in the pool, there's quiet shady spots for you and your sweetie.  When we were leaving the pool was being rented out for some fancy event - obviously this spot appeals to all.  Go.  Now.
- BEDS.  We are now trying to figure out where we can buy one.
- Cleanliness - My sweetie calls me Diva and Diva was very happy here :)
- I get lost. It was easy for me to find the coffee shop, my room, food, and bellhops.  Left to the pool, right to starbucks.  Not once did I find myself lost in a fancy, monolithic mall.

CONs:
- My sweetie is a gambler and has a specific gambling style.  He didn't have any interest in gambling at TI and spent his gambling time and money down the street.  If you are The Gambler, tuck your wife away at the pool and ease on down the road.
- Restaurants - I am a healthy eater and enjoy decent food and did not like any of restaurants but for a few items at Kahaunaville.  That said, KV priceswere pretty reasonable, quality was above average.  
- Late Checkout - It was a bummer that the late checkout on a Monday was only 12 pm.   They need to bump that up.",0,0,0

The problems, though few, are a bit annoying.  First, the re-branding of Treasure Island (whenever it happened) from a pirate-themed, family-friendly place to TI was a monumental mistake.  As such, it's not clear what this place is trying to be. Is it trying to be a party place? Possibly, judging by how, on certain days, its pool appears to be an extremely cheap ripoff of the clubbier pool parties on The Strip.  But if that's the case, how is it that there's no up-and-coming nightclub in the hotel?  Makes very little sense.

Then there are those ""resort fees"" that they never tell you about.  I was told that the fees were covered in the reservation, and yet, after sitting though a terribly long line to check-in, I was told that I would have to consent to a $22\/day resort fee.

The front desk associate was hesitant at first and said, ""Well, can't she just do it in the bathroom?""  No.  It is a sterile exchange procedure and has to be done in a somewhat clean environment and a bathroom is NOT a clean environment.  She then was able to get us an early check in which was great!  She also told us that she had just finished chemotherapy.  I wish her the best of luck with her health!  Hopefully she never had to do chemo in a bathroom.

We stayed here twice this past year for conventions we were attending and the only place we went to at the hotel was Gilley's for country\/western music & dancing.  The rest of the property is not too exciting....by Vegas standards.

We've seen Mystere half a dozen times so there's no real incentive to watch it again.

The rooms are just ok, nothing special.  Keep your expectations realistic.  Hopefully, the property doesn't decline any further as it's already 20 yrs old now.  As long as they remain a cheap alternative for rooms during conventions, we'll keep coming back from time to time.

Aria and Treasure island definitely have my favorite bathrooms out of all the hotels in vegas. So damn big and spacious. They got rid of the sirens show month ago and i am honestly ok with that now. The pirate ships just sit outside quietly. I have never been to Gilleys or Senor frogs but have been to the buffet. The buffet is pretty good overall but i doubt it compares to the bellagio or caesers palace buffet.  The sportsbook is not too big but really nice. Was there for the ohio state national championship game and it was great. Tons of crystal clear tvs everywhere. Huge casino floor that i still haven't completely mastered yet tbh. A lot of variety of slot machines and tables. I know they have a cirque show but i am not really into that stufff.


Kahunaville guys are always giving away coupons and stuff by the escaltors so make sure to check that out. I just hate the vegas show girls who give you that fake million dollar bill. They swear you will be entered to win a car. Looks like some type of scam to me...........
I could be wrong though.


I highly recommend Treasure Island. It has a great location and everything you will ever need out of a Vegas hotel. Place is borderline perfection.

Only people who don't like Treasure island are like super picky people who absolutely must stay in a 5 star hotel.

I have to say, it's probably the best value in Vegas. I paid $30\/night (plus $35 daily resort fee--standard for most hotels with amenities on the strip) and the room was fantastic! The bed was super comfortable!!! The cable had some really good channels. We watched several excellent movies on Showtime, so we weren't bored during our downtime. The gym is fantastic (but closes kinda early.) There's a 24\/7 CVS onsite & it's a lifesaver for the little things. Upon check-in, we got coupons for BOGO buffet. I am not typically a buffet fan (poor quality of standard buffet food & the fact that the food sits there & gets old), but we thought we'd give it a try. Wow, TI's buffet was so good!!! Service was impeccable. Again, I was impressed! We also ate at the Seafood Shack (another BOGO coupon) & it was also good, although not as delicious as the buffet. The service there was meh, but not bad. We had drinks in the bar just outside & 2 thumbs up for the drinks! No skimpy pours in that place!!! We went to see Mystere by Cirque du Soleil and it blew my mind!!! Loved every minute!!! Because we were guests at the hotel, we got BOGO on that, too! They upgraded our tickets for free at the box office, then the usher upgraded us again during seating. We ended up with killer seats!!! It was an amazing night! Next Vegas trip, we'll definitely be going back to Treasure Island. :)

In all honesty, I only had a couple little minor gripes, so here they are (1) no coffee makers in the room or coffee offered complimentary anywhere in the hotel! I've never experienced this! We had to purchase coffee togo from the casino floor ($7 for 3 tiny black coffees) or at Starbucks ($10 for 2 large black coffees). That sucked! (2) We had a beautiful view of the strip from the 17th floor, but the windows were so FILTHY that you could hardly see what was going on down there when the sunlight hit the window! I'm sure we just happened to catch it between washings, but they really shouldn't let them get that bad. It's Vegas; It's all about that view! 

All in all, fantastic stay at Treasure Island! Will be back!",0,0,0

First, some drunk dude decided our hotel room was his at 5:30 in the morning and wouldn't stop knocking until security came and escorted him to his correct room, which they did in a timely manner. Second, the hotel was without hot water one morning, and a cold shower is NOT what you want to step into when you've got a massive hangover. The front desk didn't offer much in the way of an explanation for this, but it was fixed within an hour or so, I believe. Very frustrating, but ultimately harmless.

The hotel room itself was nice enough, spacious by Vegas standards. Our standard queen room actually felt bigger than the comparable room at the Bellagio, which surprised me. The casino is large, with plenty of slots and table games with the standard strip odds and minimums. I didn't gamble while there, so I can't hold an unnecessary grudge against it. One downside I did notice: the hotel elevators are in the middle of one of the main casino thoroughfares, so you basically have to fight through a crowd every time you go to\/from your room. I feel like that's nit-picky, but other strip hotels have slightly better spacial planning.

The biggest plus for me was TI's location. Since it's at the very north end of the strip, you can bypass a LOT of strip congestion and traffic when you stay here, which ultimately means more time for gambling, drinking, and general Vegas debauchery!

I'd stay here again, but I'm not sure that it would be my first choice strip hotel.",2,1,0

A smoking room with no alternative? Ridiculous. Our room was booked months ago, specifically designating a nonsmoking room- that's not an acceptable way to conduct check in. The room was disgusting, smelled of weed throughout the night and morning. We were offered an ""upgrade"" the following day, which is the sole reason we stayed at the hotel. It is the SAME room with the SAME view a few floors higher. The manager at the front desk couldn't have cared less for the fact that I was sick and this experience has been completely unacceptable. After offering the same small room with a different view (which may have made sense in the first place), which I declined because I'm tired of seeing any more mediocrity- the manager waived the resort fee.

The room was decorated in dark contemporary furniture with soffttt duvet covers\/sheets\/pillows. The towels were big and fluffy. There was even an alarm clock with a built-in iPod dock! I was even MORE excited that I had just bought a new iPod Nano two days before my Vegas trip! 

Large bathrooms, only one sink, the shower was nothing to brag about. Oh and the WET Salon products smelled gross. I can't recall what the scent reminded me of...Like Fruity Pebbles or something.

The rooms were renovated recently and the upgrades are apparent.  Very large wooden console built-in to the wall with a desk, drawers, and a flat screen television. In my room on the 18th floor I had a view of the Strip and of the twice daily Sirens show out front (the fireworks were impressive, but sometimes they got a little annoying).

The casino is very large with tables and slots of every denomination.  I was up quite a bit a few times here (in contrast to not making any money at other casinos) and my Player's Club account is full, so I hope that they'll send more room comps my way.

As with everything it seems like the small things are always what create the tipping point.  For example, they take pride in being able to provide personal items to guests when needed.  Well, I needed some shaving cream because the TSA threw mine away.  I got two razors instead and when I inquired they said they didn't shaving cream.  Hmm...

There weren't many places to eat late at night, which struck me as odd considering that I did most of my gambling after midnight and\/or just before dawn.  I received comp for the $22 dinner buffet, so I checked it out.  After waiting outside for 10 minutes at 9:00 p.m., I was lead through a dining room that had tables covered in dishes that hadn't  been cleared.  I apparently waited because no one could pick up some plates.  Again, it's the small things.

Great location on the Strip and the rates are pretty reasonable for everything that they have available.  I don't think I'll be back unless it's free, but if you do pay the bed will be what makes it worth your money... Amazingly soft and comfortable!

Oh - and the pool wasn't anything special.  Service was quick, but the chairs are old and the pool is pretty small.  I got a little annoyed whenever the speakers would crackle almost like static on an old FM radio.  It's 2008 and you can buy satellite radio and outdoor speakers. :)",1,0,1

What they don't tell you at the front desk is that they're going to charge your card for payment until you checkout.  Didn't work for us since we were planning to pay cash.  Caused all kinds of over drafts on my acct.  

We reserved tickets for Mystere and they did the same thing.  Either they don't know how to get an authorization on a credit card or they just don't want to risk it.  

As for the room, the A\/C didn't work when we first got there and it was a HOT day.  We called and they came right away to fix it.
The shower head was horrible (needed a serious CLR treatment) and the drain was not working properly.
They must've had a note to fix it because the maintenance guy mysteriously showed up the next day to fix it.
They do have flat screen TV's, but if you're planning to hook a laptop or other device to watch your own stuff, don't bother.  They have the programming locked so you can't change the input.  Plus the TV is mounted in a way that you can't see the underside which is where the inputs are.  Had to use my phone to take pics to find out which ones to use, only to find out I couldn't switch to that mode afterward.

I've read reviews that the pool is too small, but it seemed fine.  If you go right at noon, then I can understand that it might be packed.  We went in the later afternoon and it was fine.
It's also only 4' deep so it's good for young kids if you have them.

The casino is a good size.  Not huge like MGM.  More like NY\/NY.  In fact maybe even a little smaller.

Don't bother with the buffet, at least the dinner one.  Wasn't worth the $23 even if you get the 2 for 1 coupon.  Would have rather gone to the Outback Steak house across the street.

Final note, if you need internet, better off paying the $20 resort with your room.  It's supposed to cover it. 
The business station they have charges for everything (PC, copier, fax).  They have credit card swipes attached to all of them.

I quickly passed on that since I didn't care to use any of the services it provides anyways like wifi, gym etc.",0,0,0

The casino appeared to be operating only at about 1\/2 since it was slow season but I remember getting the hotel and flight for only $130\/person so I will not complain about things being closed or what not.  

The hotel experience was nice but what I really remembered about this hotel was the hospitality when I forgot a bag of souvenirs after arriving home.  I called the hotel and they were able to locate the package (which had already been turned in by the housekeeping staff) and they offered to ship it to me overnight using FedEx at their expense!!!

The view was spectacular, but with the view came the noise of the party pool. Which club music was blasted from 12pm- until the pool closed. Which was unfortunate when we wanted to relax by the pool, but couldn't because the music was so loud I started to get a headache just stepping out into the pool area.

It was once a pirate themed hotel but was rebranded as ""TI"" in 2003 and only small vestiges of its old kitschy vibe remain. It's also the home of the original Cirque Du Soleil show Mystere and several nice restaurants. Rooms in the off-season are below $100 and there are lots of deals that bundle in Mystere tickets. 

The Rooms: Let's start with the bad. My normal room had central heating\/cooling, mediocre views of the industrial parts of Vegas, a frustrating television system that had an incredibly slow menu, and a fridge that should've been colder. Now for the good. Nice spacious room, good comfortable pillows and sheets, extremely fast elevator, quiet rooms, and a very comfortable and spacious bathroom.

The Casino: Constant noise, lights, stacked odds, and pretty women passing around drinks. I'd say it's slightly above average for Las Vegas.

The Shows: Mystere is a great show in a nice small venue that basically offers awesome seats no matter where you sit. When I was there you could even watch practices on the weekends for free!

The Restaurants: I didn't actually try eat in any of the restaurants but my friends had many nice things to say about them. One oddity is that their Asian themed restaurants basically serves every single type of food on the planet from sandwiches to pizza to pho... which doesn't sound very Asian.

Conclusions: Beautiful hotel, good value for the money, good location, good Cirque Du Soleil show, free parking, standard spacious casino, and great rooms. Honestly, I'd give this hotel 5-stars if it was in any other location but Las Vegas has really stepped up its game with breathtaking hotels like The Bellagio, The Palazzo, and City Center. If you can't afford the $50-100 up-charge to go to a 5-star hotel like the ones I just listed, I would highly recommend TI.",0,0,0

Depressingly trashy and full of boring chain restaurants, I don't understand why anyone would waste vacation time here.  We were on our way to Zion and Bryce Canyon and had to fly into the hell-hole known as Las Vegas.  We initially booked two nights because we'd never been, and we were both ready to leave by the morning.  Thank God that Red Rock Canyon and Hoover Dam were nearby.

That being said, Treasure Island the hotel itself was nice and cheap.  They probably hate people like me, who get a $40 room and are expected to make up the difference by gambling hundreds of dollars.  No thanks.  They do up-charge for WIFI, etc.  The rooms were upscale and beds were luxuriously comfortable.  The hotel has everything that you could expect at a hotel in Vegas- robots sitting at slot machines with a lit cigarette, a cheap drink, and permanent frowns plastered on their face.  It also had cheesy places like ""Kahunaville"" and ""Senor Frogs"" in the bottom of the hotel.  Having heard glorious things about buffets in Vegas, we had to check out the one at Treasure Island.  Think: cafeteria\/jail food quality.  

The Treasure Island Pirate (""strip"") show is definitely for adults only- not sure why people had their 12 year kids there.  Definitely plenty of immature innuendos going on, while prepubescent boys drooled with desire and dads guffawed at the scantily clad pirate strippers.

I have been to TI before although I have never stayed there. After pouring over tons of reviews, websites, pictures, youtube videos and Vegas travel sites we settled on booking the Executive Suite at TI. We found a great deal for around $120 a night, the room looked pretty cool online, loved the foyer\/two bathrooms and felt that staying at a mid range hotel better suited us than one of the really fancy joints (stayed at Cosmo last trip).

I originally booked a three night stay and all was well. The troubles began when we decided that five nights might be a little more enjoyable.

We called up to update the reservation since you cant book the Executive Suite online. They allowed us to use the same code and the price was fair. They said they would send us an updated confirmation. They sent it, but it wasnt updated. It was still for the original three nights. Lovely.

I called and asked for them to please send an UPDATED confirmation later that evening. They assured me that my reservation was updated and they would send it.
It never arrived.

I called the next day (third time now). They said that sometimes the email could take twenty four hours to arrive. I have never had it take that long to send an email. Regardless, I told them it had already been twenty four hours and that both of my prior confirmations had arrived instantly. They said they would send it again. Never got it.

Called again the next day. At this point I was still being really nice about it and wasnt upset yet. The gentleman told me he would send the confirmation and that it would arrive within twenty minutes? So now an email takes twenty minutes? Again I did not receive an email. This wouldnt have been that big of  a deal but my first updated confirmation was wrong and at this point it was just plain incompetence.

Called a FIFTH TIME the next day and asked for a manager. He gave me several excuses about their email being down etc. Nobody had told me that before. He said he would send and I told him if I didnt get it within 20 minutes I was cancelling. I ended up getting it about 45 minutes later with one of the most poorly written apology letters I have ever seen. Misspelled words, no punctuation, etc. Seriously? What a bunch of monkeys. 

I cancelled and booked elsewhere. If they handled such a simple situation as this so poorly I can only imagine the situation had there been a problem with my room or something actually important or even remotely challenging.",2,3,0

Cons- 
NO Coffee maker or lobby coffee service.  You can, however, trek to Starbucks in your pjs for overpriced coffee.  Of course that means you have to meander thru the smoke-filled casino to get it.

Front desk is a joke!  Stood in line 45 minutes to check in.  This is after 4.5 hours on an airplane.

The casino bar is TERRIBLE.  The bartenders were so rude.  You're supposed to get free drinks if you're playing the games at the bar. (They require a $20 minimum and $1  bets).  They still charged us every time.  When we inquired we were told they didn't know we were playing and it was too late to undo the charges.  But worse that this, they were just plain unfriendly.

Cab- apparently if you don't tip the doorman he refuses to shut the door of the cab.  We had no idea we were supposed to tip this guy for doing nothing but standing outside blowing a whistle.  He flat-out refused to shut the cab door.  It was ludicrous!!  Our cab driver cursed him all the way to our destination.

Outlets-  You wouldn't believe the gymnastics I had to perform in order to charge my phone.  The only plug I could find was on an overloaded power-strip under the bed.  Every time the power strip moved the lamp came unplugged as well as the phone!!

TV- don't expect to watch television here.  There were maybe 6 channels that actually showed up on the tiny (like 15 inch) televisions and even they jumped around.",4,3,1

Still a bit fun as its a themed hotel casino - as they were intended to be - but minus one star for dropping the pirate show up front - the kid brother was so sad. You should have seen his gigantic bottom lip quiver - lollipop in hand - when I broke the news.

Don't stand there holding your breath waiting for the pirate show. Looks like they sold a part of the moat to a drug store so that the pirate ships can't move like they once did. I really don't like the look of these drug stores scattered all up and down the strip - Bally's just got one too. Why not just put a vending machine in the hotel lobbies for the hopeful freshly minted 21 year olds so they can buy their condoms there?

Good location. I prefer Paris, Cromwell, Bellagio, and Ceasers or Flamingo though. That is the heart of the strip - the magical 4 corners. If location is your priority - as it should be when choosing real estate - even just for a few days - choose one of the above. BTW Harrahs has a monopoly on all that with the exception of Bellagio.

The clientele at TI is one of the best parts about the property. TI attracts a fun crowd that is young at heart - even if the average age of visitors are probably in their 30s (like me). They did a major re-branding some years back and I remember the day they took down the cool skull-and-crossbones strip marquee to replace it with an LED ""TI"" sign. They changed the pirate show into something more sexy with ladies in skimpy bikinis and clearly were aiming to attract a more mature crowd instead of children. 

The hotel: I like how there is just one tower. The whole property is a work of art. A big thanks Steve Wynn - he contributed so much to the city... and earned the right to slap his name on his new resort. Here at TI - no add ons or afterthoughts to wreck the original intent of design - you know the resorts where there are so many groups of hotel elevators where you can never find your tower or room. Even Bellagio sold out in around 2005 with their new little tower that required the tear down of the beautiful staircase for their ugly add on afterthought tower. Enough ranting.... rooms here at TI are good quality and of average size. With around 2800 rooms and suits expect a bit of a wait to check in. I would plan to check in at an odd hour - either before or after the rush.

On my bucket list is to visit the old skull marquee at the Neon Sign Graveyard Museum and well, the kid brother will just have to make due with watching some of the old pirate show on a cheap quality Youtube video.

I  haven't seen this since I was a kid.  Man have this show changed from family friendly to an adult choreographed dance show with hot ass female pirates taking one male pirate as a hostage.  I couldn't even pay attention anymore becauseI was too busy checking the female pirates in sexy ass costumes.  And ladies, there are male pirates for you to look at as well.  It's basically just a dance show now with some stunts involved.

Outside of this place get really packed and be ready to stand up for awhile.  I'm a bit paranoid being in overly crowded places and was being extra cautious of pick pocketers.  It's really hard to see the action from both sides so I suggest to those who want to see the female pirates to be on the left side and the male pirates will be on the right.  It's an ok show, nothing really special, but hey it's free so I give it 3 stars for a free show.

Treasure island has plummeted downhill faster than a runaway roller coaster.  To begin with, my reservations were messed up and as previous guests had mentioned there is a hard sell for the resort package. The website is very misleading when booking this property. They only reason we stayed at Treasure Island was it's proximity to the Sands convention center. My employer felt the time and expense in taking cabs or shuttles from some of the better hotels was justification for the selection of treasure Island.    Never never never again would I stay in this hotel or recommend anyone stay in this hotel.    Maintenance is lacking.  I reported my bathroom sink was clogged upon my arrival and they promised to have it taken care of.   I spent four nights there and the sink was never was completely un clogged.  The shower had black mold in the grout and the water never did run hot.   There was no television guide nor did the television screen indicate what channel we were watching. That meant that in order to find one of the morning news shows I had to scroll through 117 different channels.   Many in a foreign language.  Rooms were pricier then some of the Caesar's properties that I typically stay in. I would predict that Treasure Island is not going to survive in the competitive market for rooms in Las Vegas for very long.

The stoic lass at the check-in counter appeared tight-lipped about where locals went for fun, but she did set things right with a room on the 26th floor that had a great view of the strip. The deluxe room was nicely furnished and comped for three nights, so what was there, really, to complain about? Actually, the TV sucked with its senile remote control and scattered satellite signal, and it wasn't set up to crane out of the wall. Still, the king-sized bed was comfortable and nice to lie in to watch a bit of ""vacation TV,"" a.k.a. Saved By the Bell.

Someone stole the Do Not Disturb sign, so it was annoying to have housekeeping scream greetings into the room bright and way too early the next day. At least it motivated me to go down to the pool, which is lounge-worthy, but rather small, and made especially so by the slew of sunbathers claiming their plastic chaise lounges at bloody nine in the friggin morning, I mean, people, could you not sleep off your hangover in the dank of your curtained hotel room? Imported beers cost $10 a plastic pint, but since it's practically the medicine of Vegas, I was fine with the $60 breakfast buzz bill (solids not included).

I like to gamble with minimal effort, which is to say, I dig the $1 Wheel of Fortune machines. It's all about the spin, baby. That is, until you're $300 into a machine that keeps teasing with small winnings but never delivers the money shot. That's when you spin the situation and say to nobody and everybody, ""It's all about the comp dollars, baby"" and look for a cocktail waitress to at least get that free drink.

I should have known things weren't going to go well when I pulled up. The bell men were standing around talking watching me and my elderly mother trying to pulled out our luggage from the trunk. They finally asked if we needed help once we got onto the curb, by that time I was annoyed so I declined their help. 

We walk into the hotel where they have a big sign stating check in is not until 3:00, but as a courtesy they will start checking us in at 10:00.. I've been to the Monte Carlo several times and it's never been an issue before. They couldn't have been sold out, but it was just another ""Little"" issue for me.

Our room was small but decent. I was a bit surprised by the size of the television though. The beds were a bit hard but plenty of pillows. We did have a nice view of the strip, I just wish we would of stayed somewhere else.

We received a buy one get one free buffet coupon. I didn't read the fine print (my fault) which stated we wouldn't be able to use it on Thanksgiving day. So I went to the front desk to ask who I needed to speak with, since I had purchased a buffet on Wednesday, and we're leaving that Friday morning. The coupon could only be used for Lunch or Dinner. So front desk sent me to the buffet to get a refund. When I explained my situation to them, they said they would not issue a refund or credit. That I would need to return on Friday. I understand it was my fault for not reading the fine print, but I don't think it's good customer service either. 

We checked out on Friday, but I wanted a late check out of around 12:00. I called the front desk and the person who answered simply said it wasn't possible and hung up as soon as I said OK... I don't believe it would of hurt them, to allow me an extra hour.

Things I did not look for: 
-They are remodeling, one floor per week. We were offered a nonsmoking room but the front desk failed to mention about the noise. They had no set working hours either--time for a room change!

-Room changed to 32nd floor after a relatively painless process. Somehow we could still hear the pool party, but better than hearing the construction. Great view, but small rooms.

-At the Pho place we asked for change back twice and the waitress pretended not to hear us and stalled. We were indirectly forced to give all the remainder change to her because we had to get going for a show. But you know, all the more Las Vega$.

In the end, TI became a place to put our bags and to sleep, however minimally. Since we drove and called cabs, we would have preferred to stay at Luxor or NYNY in a suite for a little bit more money. But can't beat its location--I walked across the street and gambled at the Venetian.

I think this is the precise example of the word 'scam'. 

Buffet taste like butt anyways, don't pay for that food. I voided the charge anyways and filled my bags with the complimentary water. 

The only bonus was the cheap room price VS geographical position on the Vegas strip. 

The casino itself has a terrible smell in the air that you are reminded of everytime you enter the building.. we walked and visited every Vegas casino during our stay and none had this problem.. You gotta show your room card to the guard everytime you enter the elevator to your room, a precise reflection of the atmosphere here. My key never worked, make sure you ask for extra keys so that you're prepared.

The casino itself is definitely 2\/5 stars compared to the rest. Half the tables are never running and the general aesthetic is run down, old and clearly is just milking everything it can get without any clear sight of remodelling or change anytime soon.

The rooms again 2\/5.. nothing good to say, nothing bad. It's a bed to sleep in, smaller than what I've seen on my other Vegas trips.

The pool has very, very limited seats. Which again is a huge let down? It's packed with people inside the pool due to this problem and just doesn't feel like a relaxing place to be in.

You can see the entire strip and ""free shows"" all the way to Mandalay Bay from some of the rooms and the views are amazing at nighttime. Walking to other grander casinos and nightclubs from TI is a breeze.

Aside from location, TI is extremely underwhelming. The staff is very nice and accomodating, particularly at the check-in\/check-out desks, but I have never seen a check in line move so slowly. It was pretty painful. The casino itself is run down, for instance some of the buttons in the elevator were so worn you'd have too look at the surrounding numbers to know what they are. Also, there is a complete lack of fine dining and night life options. There's a western bar there and a terrible Kahunaville (see my review) that are meant for good times for adults, but they are both gimmicky and nonmemorable, so again the proximity to the other casinos is hugely needed.

Finally, the rooms have been updated and are more modern but in my experience they are not maintained well. The sun shining into our room cast a light on the furniture that displayed dust laden everywhere, and there were some rust stains in the bathroom.

I called the front desk was told they could deodorized the room. No way was going to help. They said they could get someone to walk the halls. I think it was the neighborhood having a good time. It's cool do what you want but be respectful to others. My wife is pregnant so we went to my brother's room on the 25th floor. Walking out the elevator you smelt more weed. I thought it was just me but other people got out another elevator saying the same thing. Luckily the room didn't smell. Later that morning I went to the front desk and demanded a room change. Thankfully they did. So now we lost our view and had to move our stuff from the 26th floor to the 23rd.

We had a deluxe room but asked if a strip view room was available and he put us in one with no extra charge! Our room was clean and the view was great from the 10th floor.  Yes they charge the $22\/day resort fee but we knew this way ahead of time and planned for it.  

The only time we had to complain is because on the website it said 2 for 1 lunch and dinner buffet.  So when we decided to use it on our last night we noticed it said breakfast or lunch only so we called them and told them what it says on there website and they checked it out and gave us the coupon that says 2 for 1 lunch or dinner.
They also give you 2 for 1 cocktails that you can use and Kahunnaville passes out tons of 2 for 1 cocktail coupons.

The buffet was fine we went for breakfast and dinner both once.  We signed up for the players club card and got $10 in free play and an extra $5 in free play. 

We liked the location because its next to the mall and across from wynn, encore, palazzo and Venetian and close walking distance to the
 more middle strip hotels.  The pirate show was corny... ""Who you calling ahoy!""   Lmao!  That's what the ladies in the show said!  But watching the ship sink was cool.

Overall we enjoyed our stay and are planning on staying again when we come back next year.",2,0,1

The rooms were clean and decently sized but didn't have a fridge.  I really don't have any complains otherwise.  The hallways smelled nice, like sandalwood or something.  Can't comment on the pool as it wasn't open and it was winter so I wouldn't have gone anyway.

The big problem was the service.  They gave us the wrong room.  They told us they were giving us a two queen room at the desk and we ended up with a single king bed.  Then one night coming back, they turned the water off on our floor without telling us and we had to wait half an hour before taking a shower (not pleasant after a night of clubbing).  They also screwed up our wireless internet account and we had to call the front desk fix it (thankfully they did).  Overall, they seemed a little disorganized in general.  They even forgot to charge us resort fees (of course, not complaining about that...).

That's kind of a lot of complaints for a 4 star review, but in the end the problems were minimal considering how little I paid (worked out to about $33 per person for two nights).  But again, it does get pricier during summer.  And I wouldn't bank on them forgetting the resort fees either.

The layout of the hotel is a pain in the butt. You need to take specific elevators to get to specific floors, and you have a one-in-four shot of making that correct guess on your first try. It would have been nice if the staff made some mention of this when they checked us in, but check-in and staff are another issue. Also be prepared to be stopped by security at the elevators every time you go to your room, no matter what hour of the day it is. All you need to do is show them your key, and you're allowed to pass, but since the keys arnt color coded or marked, don't expect any assistance if you're at the wrong elevator bay. You'll learn once you're on the elevator and there either is, or isn't a button for your floor. 

Checking into the hotel was a nightmare. We made our reservation thru the hotel website, with a credit card, yet check-in took over 25 min from the time we got to the counter (not including the line, which you can skip for $40). The woman who checked us in, made no attempt to explain what the delay was about, or what else she needed, instead she would get on the phone and call another department. When we over heard what she would say to the other department, we would try to show her the info she said she needed, but she ignored us while she was on the phone.  At the 15 min mark, I called over a manager, who was slightly better. After 25 min, they had billed us twice, and sent us on our way with one apology from the ""manager"" I called over, no apology from the girl at the counter, no indication that we had been billed twice, without having our pre-paid food credit activated, and with an envelope from the ""manager"" that she said contained some 'free drinks for the inconvenience' but actually contained coupons for buy-one-get-one-free drinks. Thanks for nothing. It wasn't until we were in the room we noticed our card was charged twice. After calling the front desk three times with no answer, we went back down. They said they would take care of it, again with no apologies. The third time we were at the front desk was twenty min later when our pre-paid food credit wasn't working. They activated it, but only after giving us the third degree, as if we were trying to get it for free. Again, no apologies and no thank you.

Your employee Carol (is what her name tag said) The receipt says Carolina) saw the whole thing happen and knew it was an accident, but instead of being courteous and understanding she was extremely rude. She told my husband to throw the two donuts away as he was apologizing. Then she walked up to the case and grabbed the box from my husbands hands. She then proceeded to very sternly tell him how he was doing it wrong and wouldn't allow him to get the donuts. She got them instead. I might add we had not been drinking what so ever, and nor were acting crazy. It was an honest mistake and she made my husband feel so stupid. After she got the donuts she gave him the box and we were ready to check out. She walked up to the counter and didn't say a word. She wouldn't even make eye contact with us. She was extremely rude and literally said nothing to us. I was absolutely appalled at her behavior.

We had a nice view (we were on the 3rd from the top floor) king size bed, sleeping area, living area and wet bar in a different room and two bathrooms! One bathroom was huge with a Jacuzzi tub and the other bathroom was smaller with a very large shower. We were very pleased with the room and would stay here again if the price was right.

I don't eat casino food and I find the buffets to be gross BUT the T.I. has a decent buffet and the best part is the cotton candy station in the dessert area :) There was also a pretty good pasta section that was made to order.

The hotel:
Much better than I expected as the cost of this hotel is usually lower than most other places on the strip. They easily gave us two queen beds upon a longer-than-it-should-have-been check-in. I was expecting to have to still pay resort fees, but we were never charged. Extra bonus!

Comfortable beds, great bathroom, and good amenities. All things you really need when staying in a hotel. TI had them all. 

Location-wise this hotel is good. It's a little on the north side of the strip, but you have easy access to other north-strip hotel casinos like Wynn\/Encore and Palazzo\/Venetian. 

Casino:
The casino itself isn't as insane and hectic as many others on the strip mainly due to the location on strip and its manageable size. They have everything you need to gamble, so you won't be sorry coming in.

Overall I would definitely stay here again because it really is a nice hotel and casino. You can usually get a great deal on price, but there aren't any drawbacks, so it ends up being a great value!",1,0,0

Checking in has never been the most hospitable part of the trip. We understand that they're trying to get a bunch of people checked in and out simultaneously, and we don't mind waiting in the long line.

We booked our trip long before the 3PM check-in time rule, and we arrived at 8 in the morning. I asked the Manager how I might be able to pay the extra $25 dollars to check in early, and he quite rudely told me that I just couldn't check in until later. He then told me that we had to leave the lobby, and take our luggage out of it. When I asked another person what was going on, she begged me to please get my luggage out of the lobby before her Manager had a talk with her about it.

When we were finally able to check in at 10AM, I commented on how rude the Manager was (and that everyone else was nice) and she looked worried that he might overhear me. He stood in the background frowning and shaking his head ""no"" the entire 20 minutes we waited in the express check-in line.

I HATE IT WHEN EMPLOYEES ARE SCARED OF THEIR BOSSES- this is not the way to manage staff. This is unprofessional, and does not give the customer a very good impression of how things are run.

Plus- the pool is a miserly little pad of water, and all of the chairs are chained together in these creepy rows. It's just not aesthetic or comfortable to sunbathe so close to strangers. Every other hotel on the strip has a much better family-friendly pool, even the Flamingo or the Monte Carlo!

The buffet is pretty hit or miss.  I've had an amazing champagne brunch there on Sunday before, but this previous Sunday was pretty much a let-down.  Spend a fews dollars more and go to a place like the Wynn or Venetian.

Read reviews on Yelp and was really scared to stay here, but to my surprise it was a very pleasant experience. We arrived super early on a Sunday morning and a bellhop met us at our taxi. We told him we were way too early for check-in so he told us to leave our luggage and they will deliver them to our rooms once we've checked in. He also told us we can check in by 1pm even though the website said 3pm. 

The line to check-in was really long but flowed smoothly. Rohit helped us and was very accommodating. We asked if there were any upgrades and he found us a suite facing the strip! It was AH-MAZING!

Cirque du Soleil has a show at TI, which is Mystere.  There is also the Sirens of TI show, which is free nightly, and headline acts that perform like Bill Cosby and LeAnn Rimes.

It is budget, but you are paying a bit more for the resort feel. If you are not made of money, this is your best option. I stayed here in November 2013. The place was busy, but no big lines at check-in when we arrived.  FYI everyone will be charged the resort fee per night which was $25 at the time I went. It doesn't matter what deal you paid for or what your travel agent told you, you are going to have to pay it no matter which hotel you stay at in Vegas.  But, to make up for the fee TI at least gives you coupons for meals, drinks and gym which pretty much makes up for the cost.  The buffet is just alright, nothing spectacular, but the wait in line was never long.  The casino is pretty standard, but if you look around it pretty much has everything you could want.  The other restaurants are pretty decent too.  Señor Frogs and Kahunaville  are fun places to get your drink on and use those coupons for food. 

The room was nice and quite spacious and clean for a basic with two queens with a large bathroom, small, empty fridge and safe. No coffee makers provided in rooms in Vegas anymore. You have to pay extra or go to Starbucks which is right downstairs.  We didn't get the strip view since I thought the back rooms are quieter.  We got a great view on a high floor, but there is a train that goes by and blows their horn all through the day and night. There is a tram to the Mirage which was awesome and the self parking lot was not too hard to find a space. All the staff people I encountered were nice.

Upon check-in, we were told that there were no non-smoking rooms available, even though one had been requested upon our reservation over a month beforehand and we were staying for four nights. We were told we could check the next day to see if any had come available, but would have to deal with the inconvenience of changing rooms mid-trip. The room itself was nice, and the bed was very comfortable, but the smell of smoke had permeated everything.

Also, we had booked using the TV special promotion which included Buy 1 Get 1 50% off buffet, with no mention of any restrictions as to what meal, and when we arrived we were given Buy 1 Get 1 Free for the dinner buffet and told we could not use it for the breakfast buffet instead, which we preferred as we had made plans for our dinner meals already so basically ended up losing the value that we had planned on.",0,0,0

Next we ordered room service at granted 5 a.m. But the food came to our room and was absolutely disgusting the bacon was see through the eggs were fake the hash browns were soggy and not to mention we ordered a grilled cheese that was disgusting ( how do you mess up a grilled cheese)we did not eat even half of our food and called room service to let them know they proceeded to pick up our uneaten food to evaluate it then told us that because we had taken a bite of anything they would not refund any of our money eggs and bacon and a grilled cheese sandwich and an orange juice cost $65. You would think for $65 the egg should be real and the food should not be horrible we were told that our complaint was not valid by the chef who refuse to try any of the food.
There was a phone outside of our room that ring all night long we did not get any sleep both days we stayed the rooms were absolutely beautiful with a great view but I would have traded the view for Sleep. 
I was charged a second time for our room service and told the refund would be processed in a few weeks I don't understand why they would charge me twice I called and spoke with the manager once I was at home and she just listened to what I had to say appologized and said that that was all she was going to do if she did she didn't seem very sincere and she didn't seem like she cared about any of the issues we had. I told her I would be posting a yelp review and she told me oh good have a great day and hung up on me so I will not be staying at Treasure Island again.
After spending $600 in a hotel you would think that you would get treated with a little more respect however if they do not care about each individual customer all they care about is the fact that you are bringing money into their casino you are just a number.

I booked through Orbitz half off rooms, I couldn't beat that. The reason I chose this hotel because it is located next to the MIRAGE. We had tickets to Beatles LOVE show and planned a day trip of hiking in The Valley of Fire. Treasure Island is the perfect location on the strip, you can literally walk to everthing.  Great Location.

When we arrived it was kind of hectic in front of the hotel but we opted for valet service, which was simple enough. I'm all for convienace....We checked in and check in took only 5 minutes tops.  We had booked a non smoking room with a view of the las vegas strip... Our room was located on the 17th floor and I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in the room. The room had modern decor( exactly what was pictured on the website) Flat screen TV, modern lamps lighting,goose down pillows. The room didn't smell like smoke....YES I wont suffocate in  the room from  stench... The view was very nice from the room I could see The Mirage,Bellagio,Paris,Harrahs and many more hotels.  

We didn't eat too much while in Vegas.LOL..... but one night we found a Pizzaria Francisco @ TI. They sell pizza by the slice. If you want a cheap late night grub this will do the job. It will save you a ton of money. I had order room service on a couple of occassions and it is ridicoulously expensive.  The room service food for dinner was okay. We ordered a steak dinner( wasn't too good had alot of fat) for the price but the mashed potatoes and veggies were really good. The vietnamiese pork sandwich with celantro was okay(I wouldn't get it again).  The food for breakfast room service was great. The eggs benedict Yummy poached egg with canadian bacon, special sauce, with hash browns, bacon(Delicious). Two eggs Combo with bacon, toast (Very Good). A side of 3 large pancakes( nice, big and fluffly). One pot of coffee. Breakfast alone  was around $75, not including tip. Dinner was just as expensive. So to save money you could either eat across the street at Dennys or any other spot would be cheaper.",1,0,0

We had prebooked it a month ahead.  When we showed up at 11am, they told us there was no room available but would reserve one and have it ready by 3pm.  That was ok, so we left our luggage with the bellhop (it took 30 min.) and walked around.  At 3pm, we had to wait in line for about 30 min. to check on the room, and they said they still didn't have it ready and to come back at 5pm.  My sister asked if they could just call us when it was ready, but they said they couldn't do that.  We either had to call them or wait in line again.  However, they wouldn't answer the phone, so the other alternative was to wait again in line, which was getting ridiculously long.  Apparently there were a lot of people with the same problem, because the people in front and behind us in line were complaining.  So at 5pm we got on the line again and it took another 40 min. to get to the front desk.  At this point, the waiting room was full of people, some of which we saw when we arrived at 11am.  We were so upset,I started looking for hotels on Hotwire and found a good deal on a 5 star hotel for $150\/night. So once my sister confirmed we could get a full refund, we canceled our reservation and ended up at the Palazzo. BEST THING EVER!

If you have a small group and are looking for a cheap, yet nice place to stay that is in the middle of everything this is a good choice.  TI has been changing it's image from a family place to a hip hotel.  The things that they've added in the lobby have really seemed to attract a younger crowd.

Tangerine is an ""OK"" place to go.  If you're looking to start the night out at a club, I'd say it's a good choice but I'd move onto something bigger to end at.  I've always found the people working the door at Tangerine to be less than friendly, and it's not even that great of a club.  

Foodwise, Social House is a fun place to drop by if you want to see celebrities eating before they hit the clubs.  I haven't been to the Canter's there, but I have been to the original in LA and if it's the same then it's a good place to grab pastrami.

Roomwise, the decor is kind of outdated.  I usually get the Tower Suite so I don't know about the rooms but the Suite has a his and hers bathroom which is great for getting ready to head out.  Theres a big King bed in the middle of the room, but other than that it's kind of empty.  They should throw in a few sofas or something.",0,0,0

 i.)It's a great location centre strip
ii.) The rooms are comfortable and decorated with modern decor
iii.) Check in and check out service is excellent with a great left luggage check in.  
iv.)Excellent selection of pay per view movies including many that are only out at the cinema at present. $12.99 for a movie just out.


TIPS: 
1.) Check in as soon as possible at 11am.  The sooner you check in the higher up your room will be and probably with better views.  We had a view of the strip on the 26th floor which was excellent.  Our friends who checked in an hour or so later were ten floors down with less of a view.
 
2.) If you have pictures to take back (cartoon drawings, photographs etc) you can leave these at the front desk as left luggage after checking out - saves you from carting them around all day.

 
The not so good things about this hotel:
i.)You will be charged a $23 per day resort charge on arrival on top of your room charge.  A pretty standard charge in LV but dubious non the less.
ii.)The rooms are super small, although they do have two Queen beds (UK double beds)
iii.)There are no children's channels on the TV menu
iv.)There are no coffee\/tea making facilities in the room
v.)The in room Wifi is not compatible with Apple or Android - i.e Iphones, Ipads and android phones can't be connected to it.  My husband spent a long time on the phone to their support trying to make it work (he is a techy so was super knowledgeable) to no avail.  The Internet support were seriously lacking in knowledge and it turns out that their wifi is just not compatible with these products.  Our friends had laptops and these worked fine with the wifi.
vi.) House keeping is efficient but super slow.  Our son was sick on his bed and it took them over an hour to change the bed for us, which in the middle of the night with two children is a long time.

At first, I was a little skeptical of staying at this hotel, but it was actually a really good experience.  Yes, when we walked into our room I was a little weirded out by the mirror wall, but it turned out to be in our best interest because we could all use it at the same time.  Four girls and one bathroom mirror would not have been a good situation!  I'm sure there are other creative uses you could put this to, but I'll leave that up to you. :)

The rooms with two double beds were spacious and clean.  The beds were very comfortable.  The TV and tub are both big, though they aren't in the same room, duh, and there is a close up mirror in the bathroom.  The hotel is located on the far end of the strip, before you venture out into Old Las Vegas, but its still in a very good location to enjoy everything the strip has to offer.  You can walk to the Wynn, Mirage, Venetian, Ceasar's Palace, The Bellagio, Paris and Bally's, just to name a few.  The casino itself is pretty popular.  Their always seemed to be a good crowd enjoying themselves.  

What else can I tell you?  There's a Starbucks in the lobby, away from the casino, bonus star for that.  And in the evenings there is a free show on the side of the hotel called The Sirens of T.I., or something like that.  I never actually caught the show, but from the previews they played on the T.I. jumbotron it looked like a bunch of scantily clad pirate wenches tossing their hair around - good times!  They dance around on a real, fake pirate ship!  I've heard that the pirate show used to be more of a pirate fight, a la Pirates of the Caribbean.  I'm sorry I missed out on the original.",8,4,8

We drove from LA after work on Friday so we got to Vegas around 12am-1am. When we got there, we tried to book into our room (2 Queens, non smoking) but then the front desk advised us that our room has been double booked and that the only room available is a 1 bd smoking. For everyone that doesn't smoke, a smoking room is a really bad option for it just reeks of cigarettes! We asked for any other room which of course they said ""We are TOTALLY booked for the weekend"" reply. We asked for anything else that we can get comp'ed on since we were given this unfortunate ordeal, which the front desk replied ""Nope"". After trying for about 15 minutes, we reluctantly took the keys and just slept in our stinky room.

Somehow it gets worse here. We started gambling in TI and I guess lady luck was with us because my friend was on FIRE. He was literally winning hundreds then thousands. After a few hours of hot streak, the pit bosses of the hotel started following us and started to whisper stuff into the dealers ears during our table games. Maybe we were just being paranoid but this made us feel REALLY uneasy. And whenever we cashed out on our winnings, it would take 10-15 minutes. Yes, I know when you win big, they have to verify where we won, etc. (this isn't our first time) but this was taking longer than usual. One thing that made us feel REALLY skeptical was when my friend was betting on my other friend's hand during blackjack. We were all having fun playing this way until the 10th\/11th time, my friend tried to bet, the pitboss actually came and said that we can't do that anymore. We argued that we HAVE been playing like that the past 2 days and why all of a sudden, no? Well like some weird coincidence, the hand that the pit boss intervened on was a blackjack. Luck? Maybe but it was just a weird vibe after that. 

Most likely we'll get comp'ed for TI because of my friend's earnings but even with the free comp, we doubt we'll stay at TI with this bad experience.

I booked through AAA and we got a bunch of cool things (free drinks, free buffet, $20 off our next stay etc.) I used the free buffet deal and was pleasantly surprised by the meal. It was good and provided me with fuel to see the city. The hotel had several other restaurants ranging in price. 

Now the fun part! The hotel was connected to.... wait for it...... Fashion Show Mall. I was in heaven. I love to shop and I was less than 20 feet away from mall. You could get to the mall from the inside of the hotel and bypass traffic (car and pedestrian). I don't gamble, but the casino looked lively. I will say the Treasure Island is not the hotel of choice for people under 30. If you choose to hang out in your hotel a little, then the crowd is a bit older. 

The concierge and bellhop were all great. They were very helpful throughout our stay. The hotel is on Las Vegas Blvd and next to the Mirage, close to the Bellagio and not too far from Caesar's Palace. I share this because many of the best nightlife spots are located in those hotels. 

I think this is a great choice for Las Vegas. The price was reasonable and the location was ideal for me. I never plan on spending an inordinate amount of time in my hotel while in Las Vegas, but if I did, I wouldn't mind spending a day indoors at Treasure Island.",6,1,1

There is lots to do downstairs.  The casino seems good,  we've played blackjack and some slots here several times....always won a little bit of money. They do have this grouping of tables where all the dealers are dressed like hoochies wearing nothing but panties and bras.  Not my kind of thing to play cards with a half naked chic who doesn't seem to be enjoying herself that much...but I guess some guys are in to that. I could live without those tables..but it's Vegas.

The room was average at best and sported a tiny flat screen on the wall with a hidden mini fridge in the closet. The walls are so thin we could hear the drunk idiots next to us screaming, crying and play fighting at 3am.

We were told a bottle of wine would be sent to our room which never arrived. To top it off, after I made it home I noticed my credit card was hit at least 6 times for various charges and we still can't figure out what for.

TI is connected to the Mirage by a tram, which I recommend in the blistering summer heat.  However, when you exit the tram at Mirage you are outside so be prepared.

They have a 48 price hour guarantee, which i appreciate. However, I forgot to check until 47 hours were left until check in. At that time, the price of our room had dropped $20. No big deal, although we could have upgraded to the tower suite for that $20 difference. We would have liked to do that, but didn't complain as we thought we got a fair price on a suite. When we arrived, we got through the check in line quickly and we were greeted with a pleasant smile. Check in process was quick, as it should be. We were offered an upgrade to the tower suite at check in. Impressed.

Both my girlfriend and I were pleasantly surprised by the suite. It was spacious, very clean, and had all of the amenities we needed and more. Nice view of the strip from our room. Two bathrooms in the suites are a nice treat. The toiletries from the spa were a welcome sight as compared with most hotel soap and the like. Wifi was strong and reliable. The bed was huge and very comfortable with a lot of very comfy pillows. We had an issue with our whirlpool tub as the jets would not turn on. Called down to the front desk and maintenance was at the room within10 minutes to take care of it. Again, impressed.

We did have one issue during our stay. My girlfriend had left her cell phone in our room. We realized it about 30 min after checking out, so we couldn't go up to the room. We went to lost and found to report the phone. We left her email address and my cell phone number to hopefully be contacted before we left. We decided to hit the buffet as that would give a little more time for the phone to be reported and hopefully returned. After our meal, we spent a couple hours watching a football game hoping to get a call. The call unfortunately never came. It was about 5pm before we hit the road back to So Cal. When we got home, my girlfriend had received an email that her phone was found. That email came at 3pm while we were still at the hotel watching a game. Without her phone, she couldn't check her email without paying for internet in the hotel as I do not carry a smart phone on vacation. She paid $25 for next day shipping to have her phone in hand on Tuesday. Or so we thought. Next day shipping turned into two day shipping. So, she paid for a service that was not performed as promised. Wouldn't have been that big of a deal except for the fact that there was a medical emergency with her daughter at school on Monday and she could not be contacted about it. Luckily, I was available at work and able to handle the situation. This was our only disappointment.

After the great stay we had, lost phone and overnight shipping fiasco not withstanding, we will most likely be back to TI. We like to go to Vegas once or twice a year and usually try a new hotel each time. We may have found our place to stay now. This has all the amenities we need as well as having an excellent location on the strip. Staff was excellent and always pleasant. We both recommend spending a little extra money and booking a suite. We hope to be back for a little longer stay next time so we can really enjoy everything TI has to offer. Especially a suite with that wonderful tub.",2,0,0

Treasure Island is one of the older properties in Las Vegas, and definitely is eclipsed by some of the more luxurious (and pricier) resorts on the strip, but it has become by go-to hotel for every Vegas visit.

The pros:

LOCATION! Right in the heart of all the strip action, across the street from the Fashion Show Mall, Venetian, Wynn, and lots more. The tram to the Mirage is convenient when you're too hungover or hot\/cold to bear walking a few blocks outside. TI's also right off the Spring Mountain exit on the 15 so no battling strip traffic as you get into town.

Rooms are comfortable, although not 5-star. Then again, how much time do you spend in your room? The beds are beyond comfortable, and king-bed rooms have an iPod dock which is essential for pre-partying.

PRICE! One of the consistently best deals. For weekend we pay a little over $100 a night, and the rates can get as low as the $60s on the weekdays. For the location and amenities, it can't be beat!

The cons:
RESORT FEE! I HATE the $22+ resort fee they charge, especially since I can guarantee I will not use the fitness center, business center, or any of the other ""resort amenities"" it pays for. Internet is still for a fee, and the pool has short hours, so I can never justify this! Luckily, we stay often enough to where the occasional $20 off coupon is gifted for our next stay, which makes the resort fee more bearable.

SELECTION of restaurants is sub-par, but then again, you're at the center of the strip and close to everything!
The TVs in the room have really crappy channel selections, but then again, I use it more for background noise and watching Friends re-runs at 4 AM.


All in all, I will keep going to TI for the value and convenience-- such a consistently good deal will keep me coming back! The check-in servce has always been amazing also--we've gotten free upgrades to strip-view rooms without even asking!
If you're on a budget and don't expect 5-star Wynn-quality accommodations, definitely check out TI. It has enough shadiness to make it really feel like Vegas, but is spruced up enough to make you feel comfortable. Win-win!",2,1,0

On booking.com, we paid an $20 extra to have the option of selecting a king sized bed or a room with two queens.  We needed two queens because we had a total of four people.  I even specified in the comments section that we absolutely had to have a room with 2 queen beds.  
     We get there, only to find out that they've taken the liberty of booking us a single king bed despite our requests\/reasoning for a double.  Elsi, a front desk rep, proceeded to tell us she would speak to a manager to see what she could do.  In comes the assistant desk manager from Hell, Nichollete Pelcher, riding in on her high horse, letting us know that she will ""take care of us"" and only charge us an extra $30 a day to upgrade to the two queen beds (even though we had all ready paid the up charge once through booking.com).  I was stuck, I couldn't do anything, I had to pay it or not have a hotel room.  The front desk experience with Elsi and Nichollete was about the worst customer service you can provide and will be the main reason why I'll never stay here again even if I was offered a free visit.
     Some other general comments about the hotel.  The area near the front lobby smells like ten million cigarettes have been smoked there in the last week.  The air conditioning is constantly freezing in every common area of the hotel.  We had to have our room temp set on ""Heat, Fan, Hi, and the temperature halfway up in order to get the room to 72 degrees.  The food selections are really bad.

They give two free nights a quarter and you do not have to pay the resort fee unless you use the amenities-  maybe they give you more if you play more but this is the perfect amount of free for me! It is a pretty awesome benefit. But the best part? VIP check-in line. Skip the long Vegas check-in lines and be greeted immediately upon arrival.

Rooms are standard and it is nice that they all have a mini-fridge. It you ask nicely, you may get a panoramic view room. Sometimes people do not like the placement of the tv in this room (sideways to the bed instead of straight on) but I like having the view of the strip or the mountains. 

Casino has a good mix of table and slot play. They recently moved my fishy slot machines and I think it messed with my winning mojo. I will still give them another try :) Poker room is a little small and can fee like there are a lot of locals working together. The Sportsbook has decent odds compared to nearby properties.

Nice upgrade- there is now a CVS attached so you do not have to go out to the strip to stock up on water and other items.

The spa is expensive, but what do you expect? If you stay here through the player's club you can typically get 30% off though so that helps justify adding more treatments!

Why is it not a five star place?

-a little bit smokier than some of the other casinos on the strip

The ""Siren's"" show was intertaining and can be seen from the outside bar...

Casino tables and the dealers are old and not exciting.  One of the dealers wouldn't stop talking to one man at our table, kept getting distracted in the middle of a hand!  It was so frustrating we eventually walked to a different table.  

The free buffet - don't feel special basically everyone gets this and you wait in line for 45 min just to get inside.

It is located right in the middle of the strip, near the popular clubs.  Perfect location across the Palazzo.  No complaints there.  Great show: Mystere, that I can recommend!

Who cares!  We just need a bed!

Can we at least get a pirate serving drinks behind the bar? Some sultry wenches dealing blackjack? A parrot or waterfall in the lobby?

Aside from the pirate ship outside, it's pretty much identical to any other hotel\/casino. Check-in was slow and the woman at the desk seemed a little off. The room was fine and the neighbors were a lot quieter than I had anticipated, although the top cover was dirty on the bed, the iron didn't really work, and there wasn't a coffee maker... but there was a mini fridge, safe and tv. Good enough.

We were there in winter, so the pool was closed, but from what I saw it looked pretty small. But the spa was a solid (though expensive) experience.

For those with kids, be aware: I wouldn't call this place kid friendly. Even though it sounds like it would be, the pirate ship show is filled with almost naked women. Many of the card dealers are dressed in similar attire. Also there's drunk, foul people everywhere. Perhaps Disneyland would be a better option?

Wow.  We could see almost every major casino, which was particularly stunning at night.  The room itself was comfortable and spacious - great bed, great shower, and *great* blackout curtains. Also appreciated the mini fridge so we could store some water in there.  The fitness center is really good for a hotel with new equipment and personal TVs. The location also can't be beat as it is an easy walk to the Venetian, the Wynn, Caesars, and the Bellagio which I find to be the more interesting hotels\/casinos to walk through. 

The only ding against TI is that we waited in line for check-in, guest services, and to pick up our already paid-for tickets at the Cirque box office.  We would have waited in another long line to check-out if we hadn't had the foresight to do so via the TV in our room.

Customer Service: The check in line was super long! However they did let us check in 3 hours early.

They also charged us a $20\/day resort fee; this allows you to access the internet, print your boarding passes, use the fax machine? use the fitness room, get into Club Christian Audigier for free, VIP Access to the ""Sirens of TI"" show...I personally think the resort fee is ridiculous. This is Vegas...who has time to workout. When I'm in Vegas, I consume more calories from the alcohol and eating than burn them! Rumor has it that all the big hotels in Vegas charged a resort fee. 

The Delux Room: The good...My room was on the 34th floor. The view was awesome and it was right across the TRUMP tower. The bathroom was clean, the room was nice and for $119\/ night, it was worth it. The bad...The housekeeper didn't pay attention and walked in unexpectedly. THANK GOD I had my clothes on ;). On top of that, I had problems checking through the tv. So I had to call the front desk to check out. Other than that...the room gets 4 stars. 

The ""BUFFET"": Went there for brunch and dinner. It was okay. I could tell that they don't change the menu often, because when I went there for dinner the next day, they served the same items during brunch the day before! My opinion: If you like variety, go to a different Buffet. 

Club ""Christian Audigier"": If you're paying for cover, you are just paying for the name. This club isn't ""all that"". I enjoyed the music, which was mainly hip hop and 90's. But I am also a house music fan and didn't hear any of it. I was lucky enough to get free drinks that night, however, the drinks weren't strong and I tasted more cranberry juice than vodka. I think I drank at least 5 gallons of cranberry juice that night. 5 stars for the hot bouncer working at the door (LMAO)

Hmm..what else...

Oh!...Kahunaville (Restaurant): If you receive a 20% off coupon from TI and you're on a tight budget, this restaurant isn't the spot. I thought it was expensive and the 20% off coupon isn't worth it!

Overall opinion: If you're a procrastinator like me and need to book a hotel last minute, choose Treasure Island. Great rates for a person on budget, exceptional service, convenient location AND for the ladies, a great view of a hot bouncer at Club Christian Audigier! LOL.",1,1,2

Argh! 

I remember when Treasure Island opened back in 1993 with the free battle ship show between the British and the Pirates. Of course, the pirates always win at Treasure Island. 

Originally, Steve Wynn wanted to build a second tower to the Mirage. He later decided to make it a separate resort themed for kids to keep the Mirage kid free. The location is in a prime area next to the fashion show mall and walking distance to 5 star hotels like; Wynn, Encore, Venetian, and Palazzo. Room rates won't break the bank but you do get what you pay for. Rooms here are just average and not luxurious as the Mirage. More like a step down.

Pool here is oh so small! It's about the size of Ballys for this size of resort and it can get overcrowded, making it hard to find a pool lounger. The casino here is very active and they still have the pirate theme in the casino. That's what makes Vegas unique. 

They've made some changes over the years like:

-Sirens show and removing it for a a shopping center
-Expanding Senior Frogs
- Changing the Treasure Island Marquee to something with less character and more blandness
-Remodeled hotel rooms
-Removing Mutiny Bay (Arcade) for Kahullaville
-Removing the pirate throughout the casino \/ hotel",8,3,3

I am done with cheap, filthy hotels - I was on a search for an affordable but clean hotel in Vegas and Treasure Island fit the bill!  There are a lot of great things about this hotel...

The Love:
*Great location!  There's a bridge to the Fashion Show Mall, which bridges to the Wynn & the Palazzo...and a Walgreens across the street for drinks, snacks, meds and other essentials.

*Entire casino & hotel rooms are renovated for a more modern look.  I must say I was very impressed when I walked in.  Loved the look of the lobby and casino - even more impressed with the room.  Had a standard room but the bed & sheets were soft, furniture & TV were new

*Bathrooms are clean!!  The breaking point for me is the bathroom.  If the toilet\/shower\/sink\/counter\/floors are old, dated or dirty then I am very unhappy.  Bathroom here was great!!  

*Parking garage, lobby & elevators are close to each other.  Seems like a silly thing but I hate it when hotels have the lobby on one side but the rooms are located on the opposite end of the hotel.  I also hate it when it feels like you have to hike to get to your car.  Here, the lobby is near the main entrance, you walk down the side to get to the elevators & just past the elevators is the escalator to the parking structure.

*In-room Internet is good!  Just about every hotel & casino has a resort fee now - our fee included in-room wired & wireless internet.  =)

*Housekeeping was the friendliest I've ever encountered!  Whenever we walked down the hallway, each cleaning person would say hello and wished us well.  I thought that was so nice!  When we checked out, our cleaning person wished us a happy new year & wished for us to stay even longer next time.  =)

*Starbucks and Ben&Jerry's inside the hotel - very convenient.  =)

*Request a fridge for your room - no charge! =)



The Luke-Warm Feelings:
*Resort Fee is $20 per night.  It's one of the more expensive fees I've seen but like I said before, it did include Internet and I know that other hotels charge resort fees and still make you pay extra for Internet.

*Food choices are so-so.  I'm not a fan of buffets because my stomach can't eat as much food as it used to.  The nice restaurants in the hotel did not catch my interest at all.  We ate at the coffee shop mainly.  The coffee shop food is pretty pricey for what you get.  It also has a section devoted to pho and Vietnamese food that is also ridiculously overpriced.

*Check-in and check-out lines are very, very long.  I guess that was the most bothersome part.  It took at least 30-45 minutes to wait to check-in.  They should have more people to help at this end because whenever I passed the lobby that line was always there.


Overall, the good certainly outweighed the bad.  With these tough economic times, the room rates have gone down nicely.

I have ever been treated like this by a hospitality establishment. The management at Treasure Island is absolutely despicable. I was told I would be kicked out of the hotel if I publicly expressed my disgust with this hotel... But it's check out time, so here is a big middle finger to you Treasure Island.

You have a guest that is separated from his group, without a cell phone, room key in the room ... Trifecta of bad luck. I actually had prescription medication in the room with my name on it that would prove that I was a guest in that room.

Front desk was extremely rude and told me that I would be removed from the hotel unless I purchased another room.  I was told that they would refund the charge once my friends showed back up ... Guess what? I'm now fighting the charge with my credit card company.

We chose Treasure Island because the price was right to split between four girls. When we got there we were not helped by a bellman to get our bags, so my friend had to go and get the cart herself, and then they got upset when we grabbed the cart to unload our bags for the bellmen to say that was their job... To check in it took 2 hours, and all of the front desk clerks were not there. Great. On top of that. ..they charged us a $65 a night extra for a  ""resort fee."" What is that? So now with those 2 more charges our perfectly priced room turned into being an expensive trip. Finally, we got to our room 3 hours later. So we go in to our room and the room was scarce: no soap, no shower cap, no shampoo, no lotion, no toilet paper and not enough towels for the 2 of us as we previously requested. We called for room service for the extra towels and other needs and it took 3 hours. We called twice to remind them that we were still waiting for products. They kept saying that housekeeping was backed up... I wonder why? The next day we left to go have breakfast and we put a Do Not Disturb sign on the door, for us to come back to our room and for everything to be off the bed, our beds were made & the maids had put our stuff on the floor, Our whole room is clean with all  our personal products moved around and looked like they had been shuffled through. Oh was I livid. I called to speak with the manager and he ""understood"" our situation and our frustration and offered us a $5 bottle of champagne for our trouble.... really? I told him no,  I want some thing more for what we had been through.  He did take off our 2 day resort fee. I was happy. We go down to the pool with our party cups in hand ready to relax at the pool, to have the lady at the entrance tell us we can't bring in ""outside drinks."" I told her we were told by the front desk we could bring these in...she said it was a misunderstanding... absolutely not.

I have stayed in a variety of hotels on and near the strip and I will NEVER stay at Treasure Island again because of how terrible the customer service is. This is really unfortunate because the suite we stayed in was absolutely amazing and the buffet was to die for!

The only reason I even gave two stars was because of the rooms and buffet. Our suite was very spacious and had two bathrooms (great for 5 girls) and had a fancy double door entrance. The buffet was fantastic, all the food was great especially their desserts (which serves fresh spun cotton candy by the way). Our server Park was wonderful and made our experience fantastic.

My complaints begin with the Check-in Counter and end with the Check-out Counter. We spent $700 on this suite for the weekend. The Black woman with short black hair who checked us in was horrible. I didn't catch her name, but a description is better then nothing. She didn't greet us or say anything such as ""Welcome to Treasure Island, How can I help you today""? She went through the motions, never smiling and even rolled her eyes at me when I asked my friend about the deposit we needed to put down. She handed us our room keys then hardly told us where the elevator was at then just stared at us. She did not thank us or asked if there was anything else she could do for us, just stared. WOW...first glimpse of the hotel and this is the way you are treated...not good.

Later that evening we needed to get a few items out of our car in Valet. We walked up to the counter...again weren't greeted and I asked them what we needed to do in order to get the items out. They said they would just bring the car up...great, sounds good. WELL we waited for 40 minutes to get our car. Three people came up after us and got their car before we did. So I go up and ask What's going on because we have been waiting and three others got their car before us. He assures me that it's coming and that he has no way to communicate with the people getting the cars. I say OK. Another person comes along and gets their car so at this point I am pissed. I ask to speak to a manager. They don't get one, but instead start figuring out what was taking so long. They can't even find my keys! Why? Because they never parked my car in a real spot. It was pulled up along the side behind other cars so it wasn't visible. His excuse was we have been busy then hands me the keys. I understand that your job gets busy, but no apology just a lame excuse?? NO BUENO

So the next day we head down to the buffet and our group of 4 are the only ones in line. I walk up to pay for mine with the one attendant and the other gal calls to my friends ""Next"". Well the other 2 girls in our party were sorting out their cash and didn't hear so the attendant gets frustrated and yells out ""HHEEELLLOOOOO!!"" At this point I am floored. Who does that? Long story short we complain to the manager who was nice enough, but didn't really solve the issue at hand.

And finally the check out. Now I don't have much to say here as the gal helping us out was not rude, but certainly not friendly. She never smiled, never thanked us for our stay there, never said good-bye or wished us a safe trip home. I just hope that maybe a management person will read this and maybe reconsider the way they train their employees. Customer service is so damn critical and unfortunately TI failed miserably.",3,0,0

Pepperoni Pizza: A friend complained that there wasn't enough cheese but I didn't share the same sentiment. Nice crispy crust. Tomato sauce was flavorful. I would buy a whole pizza if I had the opportunity.

Our stay was very good and we didn't experience any of the problems other reviewers posted.  It was similar to all of our other stays with one exception...the cocktail service.  

I declare the cocktail waitress ""EXTINCT"" at Treasure Island.  When you finally get one don't move from that area and tip well.  Last year we thought it was a fluke but it happened again this time.  So if you want free drinks please be prepared to wait.  

We don't typically eat at TI because the menu prices are crazy high!  The only way to afford eating there is to use the coupons you get with your room.  Also you can get some decent Groupons to offset the high prices. 

The rooms are comfortable, clean and decently priced. The location is great and you can easily take the tram to Mirage.

for my last stay i wanted adjoining rooms. when i tried to book online, it didnt have that option, so i called. the woman i spoke to said that the only way i could get adjoining rooms is if one of them was a suite. for about $30 i thought, why not? 

when i arrive at TI i was told there are no longer any adjoining room suites. say what? ... instead of bumping me up or offering me anything else, the check in person just offered me two standard rooms. ... WHAT? ridiculous! after insisting that i really wanted adjoining rooms he left me waiting at the counter for about ten mins while he talked to his manager who released adjoining standard rooms. 

okay, so at this point i am PEEVED
1. the lady on the phone was mistaken! she INSISTED that i needed to get a suite in order to get an adjoining room.... and yet when i get to the hotel check in guy offers me adjoining standard rooms. grr
2. check in guy. what is with your attitude?! never really explained what was going on, would just ditch me at the counter for ten mins at a time without any explanation, and just overall, choc full of bad attitude! i had to ask him what was going on before i got an explanation. didnt seem willing to help me out at all! just overall bad attitude. if i wasnt so damn tired with a crying baby in tow, i would have been more wiling to rip a new one and talk to his manager. how is it that someone with such poor attitude would be responsible for welcoming guests?! im surprised all the guests didnt just leave!

room review:
- clean modern decor. i loved the cozy comforter. bathroom was clean and well stocked. tv had crappy channels, but i guess who really goes to vegas to watch tv? free wifi - part of the resort fee. 
- resort fee was about $25\/room

When I finally made it up to my room I was pleasantly surprised. The furnishings looked quite modern and nice, and I got the king sized room I requested. Upon closer inspection the room left a LOT to be desired. On the first night I discovered a crusty stain on the sheets, which obviously had not been changed. After requesting for a bed linen change, the new linens had several dark stains on them. Gross! Towels were always ""crunchy"" - in definite need of replacement. Floors had obviously not been vacuumed in awhile and there were also suspicious white stains on the wallpaper. 

Hotel restaurants did not look appetizing. I went for happy hour at the TI's highly rated ""Isla"" restaurant, and while the drink was delicious their food was sub-par (they use liquid cheese on their nachos). Most of the time I ended up taking the tram to the Mirage next door for decent eats.

Flatscreen TV was crooked. Bathroom was good size and clean, but there was no fan, so if you like taking long steamy showers, you might have a problem.

Treasure Island is the best!  Here's a summary of our experience with their service for my wife's birthday getaway!
First off, the bad stuff....
We checked in early afternoon on Friday.  When we got to the check-in desk we were greeted with a ""Sorry, your room you booked over a month ago isn't available"".  Oh no, here we go again, just like the other place, right?  WRONG!
It seems that a ""Guest of the Hotel"" had our room and so it wasn't available.  I get it, but then I don't.  Guess we're not the high-rollers or friends of someone who knows someone else, so we get put down, right?  WRONG AGAIN!
Yeah, it took well over 30 minutes for our check-in lady to figure it out.  (not her fault that the present tenants decided to stay longer)  She tried everything.  We both heard her on the phone passing room numbers around over the phone.  She really tried.  Then, without us asking, she contacted the service manager.  This took a couple of conversations between the two and a few more tries at the computer, and a few more minutes of us standing there waiting for our world to come crashing down,.... AGAIN!
But lo-and-behold, they finally came up with a solution!  We had booked a suite, and they gave us an executive suite.  Now ain't that sweet!
But wait, there's more!  If you book now, you get a free bottle of Champagne on the house!  (Yeah, that's what free means, but I'm""m on a roll!).  We were also handed a few coupons for deals they had for eateries around the property.  They were good ones, too! Not just some ""Save-a-buck"" coupons, but ""real stuff!"".  
We were elated!  Could be because we got almost $100 taken off our bill, (I'd rather not say how or why, don't want to get them into trouble of any sort), maybe because they really gave it a try, maybe it's because of the courtesy we were shown.  
Now we don't expect people to bow down and lick our boots just because we're a customer, but we do expect folks to honor the fact that we booked over a month ago and would like compensation for our time and money.
It isn't their fault the tenant decided to stay overtime.  But they made up for it, and we got moved ""up"" to a bigger and better room.
GREAT FOLKS!  GREAT PROPERTY!
My buddy was reassured that he'd have a wonderful time there too, and was told how to make a reservation and what to ask for, specifically.  This was a totally different scenario not related to this write-up, but the folks are great!
So, KUDOS to CHRISTOPHER the manager, and Connie, the lady who helped us out!
We WILL BE GOING BACK, and RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO EVERYONE, not only because of the location and the way it's set up, but for the fantastic people that bend over backward and do double-flips to ensure your stay is a good one!

good & great: 

- Happy with rate. Didn't get the super deal that previous reviewer did because two of my four days were Fri and Sat. I paid an average of $106 a night for four nights, including tax and fees. 
- Pleasantly surprised at comfort and quality of room, especially sheets\/comforter\/etc.  It wasn't a large room, but I opted for the Standard so I expected smaller still. Good storage, a desk, and a reading chair by great view of strip; generous counter space in the bathroom and large tub w-shower. 
-Quiet room!! 
-Service was fine; neither stellar or irritating. 
-Canter's deli. The Reuben rocked. An actual real deli. 
- Overall happy with our choice, better than my previous trips (only 3, not vast experience), in which we stayed at really sucky hotels inc Flamingo, Frontier (I think they tore this puppy down) and somewhere I don't remember. 
- Very pleased with housecleaning  

the bad: 

-Three people in our party and I wanted a Jr suite but only the Standard rooms have the two Queen option. Seriously. 
-Lighting in the bathroom was abysmal even by hotel standards. 
-Towels had that burnt smell of towels in cheap hotels. Putting my face near them was pretty gross to me. Also rough, but I can forgive that for a massive hotel at this mid-rate.  
-LISTEN MARKETING\/PUBLIC AFFAIRS: having a resort fee that is mandatory is the height of stupidity. I asked why it was a fee and not folded into the room rate if it was mandatory. The answer was a robotic (this is my training, i must say this. only this): ""We don't want to have hidden fees"". Huh?!  Just have a room rate and call those ""extras"" what they are: amenities. Of course by calling it a resort fee they can artificially lower the perceived room rate, but another reviewer nailed it when she said she resented having to pay for extras she had no use for, e.g. two for one coupons. 
-I found the pool disappointing. But I usually do. At a resort I want an extraordinary pool environment: really large, a smaller one for small kids to spread the love, some landscaping, please oh please. I stayed in a Cabana rented by a friend, but had I been in the elbow to elbow lounge chairs I wouldn't have even used the pool area.
-Kick in the balls: I found I had to print something important at the last minute...Using the computer was $15 for TEN minutes and printing was $1.50 per page. 

Overall, I'd say it depends on what's most important to you in a hotel room. I would stay there again if the room rate (inc damn resort fee) was one of the best deals I could find and if a resort-swimming experience wasn't important to me at the time. A nice and quiet room is paramount, so that's the part of me that was nudging me to a 4...",1,1,0

They also never told me they were offering this refund, it merely appeared in my bank account. A nice surprise, but I'm not one to enjoy being surprised in money matters, especially when Treasure Island has a habit of playing games with credit cards and charging them without authorization.

This refund does nothing to alleviate the other stress and inconveniences my guests and I faced all week.

They have now officially closed down the pirate show in front of the hotel in favor of opening up some more generic drugstores and that sort along the front. I wasn't a big fan of the hotel before... but I liked the ORIGINAL pirates fighting show. I lost more interest in this hotel when they ""sexified"" up the show to become ""Sirens of TI""... a show with a bunch of half naked girls dancing and singing... with too many sexual innuendos to be a free family show...

I have never actually stayed in the rooms here, so I cannot comment of the quality of their rooms... but my favorite hotel is Venetian\/Palazzo, so my standards may be higher than others.

As far as the hotel and casino itself... it is VERY stuffy. They spray this scent in the hotel, that I guess is to help cover up the smoke smells... but is is WAY too strong and makes it hard to breath because the scent actually practically suffocates you, especially with the low ceilings. I hate walking into the hotel because of that. The hotel itself looks outdated on the inside. 

I don't know how good their players card rewards are as I only play where I'm loyal to to maximize my rewards... but I do not have enough interest in this hotel to ""invest"" in it.

Buffet: 2 stars. Okay but if it hadn't been comp'd I would have been really annoyed 'cause it wasn't an amazing value. Desserts, including cotton candy, were the best part.

Breaker for me is when something is not clean-(because i do hair, i  am licensed to touch, meaning i had to learn about ALL infection and sanitation and how to avoid spreading infection etc....) Once i walked in the bathroom i looked at the towels and saw light yellow crusty residue on the towel!!! But looking at all the towels i could clearly tell, either the temperature on their dryers are not hot enough to kill bacteria. Or someone's not doing their job washing them with the correct temperature water :\/ they did fix it after i called them but i was honestly disgusted. The headboard has wierd stains on it- just want to tell the housekeepers to pay extra attention and CLEAN!!!!  not just surface cleaning- but sanitize!! i even tipped the housekeeper extra to clean and didnt notice ANY difference.. I hope the hotel teaches them about sanitation and disinfection. The tubs, the sheets, everything! It needs it. 

Our remote control also doesnt work. then the t.v stopped working all together, when i called i was told someone would come fix it, after waiting 45 minutes, no one showed up so we called once again and were told that it wasn't the hotel, but the provider...ok? we decided to just go to bed but there were extremely obnoxious people hanging in the hallways. why isn't there employees regulating? bad choice for a honeymoon. will never stay there again.",1,0,1

We encountered several minor issues that kind of tainted our whole experience.

1. We paid extra to check in early and to check out late ($60+). We were awoken the next day at 8am by housekeeping asking if the room could be cleaned at that time since we would be checking out. Since when is late check out at 8am? 

2. Later that day we went down to the pool and ordered a drink at the pool bar. We asked to charge the drinks to our room... little did we know you have to authorize the hotel to allow you to charge things to your room and apparently this is done at check in--this was never mentioned to us. I suppose it's a good thing, just more of a pain that anything else. 

3.The third thing that happened during our one night stay occurred at the buffet. Included with the resort fee that you pay is a 2 for 1 buffet deal. Don't forget to bring along the coupon in the envelope the front desk gives you when you check in or you will be accosted by the cashier and accused of not being a guest at the hotel. I understand where this is coming from, but the manner in which we were spoken to was completely unprofessional and uncalled for. Upon returning to the buffet with the coupon that must be filled out with your name and room number, we were let in. The lady did not even look us up in the system..so what was the big deal earlier?

So I may be a tad prejudiced with this review!! 

Well here goes my thoughts on this place. This place is so hit or miss!!! The line to check in ...SUCKS ..almost always takes forever unless you are on a com'd deal , then its fantastic because the players club line is almost always empty!! The pool area, just is not all that great .   C+ in my book.  I have always had inconsistent service here even though the waitresses outfits do help the frustration of having to wait for a cocktail.  The daybeds to lay on run about $35 during the week, not bad. 

The rooms here are nice. The beds have always been nice. My rooms have had a frig in them , which is virtually a no-no anymore in Vegas! Well a frig where you can actually store things anyway. 

The casino floor stinks. I hate the layout completely.  The dealers here are like robots. Just boring! I cant tell you how many times I have seen almost no one even at the tables. The siren show that starts at night is fine. Begins about every 90 minutes. The girls are beautiful and its fun to see ..ONCE(well maybe twice)...then its complete boredom. Their long running show Mystere is very good, but its time to bring in something new. I mean how many times can you see these circus shows, especially the same one? You can get really good room\/show deals though if you have never seen Mystere, look on the website for TI and stay during the week! 

The restaurants at TI are pricey and very inconsistent. Senor Frogs is not good at all while Kahunaville(coupons galore) is not bad and the party bar next door is a blast and the only night spot in this place that seems to get carried away!! Shots are flying there!! Gilleys has always been boring when we have been and the food beyond overpriced for what you get.  The Breeze Bar near the entrance is hit or miss as well, but sometimes late gets really going. The coffee shop is good for breakfast but of course way overpriced. $15 for eggs bacon and coffee. Phils Steakhouse is very average for the money. Its expensive and one would think you would leave with your mouth begging for more. Not the case here. Portobella starter good, French onion soup not bad, Filet ok, crab good, lobster not cooked right, Halibut just very average...It was not bad overall  but for $105 each....umm...it should be a hell of alot better! 

This casino runs quite a few specials. LOOK for them online or make sure you are signed up for their players club! They run specials for locals often too. I would never pay up to stay at TI, but I guess if I get it for free up to $70. I would consider it for the price and location. Dont forget they whack you for a very expensive resort fee. Anyway dont let one of the Sirens of TI throw you off the plank here ...or come to think of it  maybe getting captured by them isnt such a bad idea and would make your rating rise to a much higher level!!

This trip we had the worst experience with the above.  

Check In:
Valet:  We pulled in earlier than normal check in and just wanted to run in and see if we could check in (did not want luggage stored at this point).  One of the Valet boys stopped my husband and said he couldn't leave the car there, my husband told him I was going to move it....Valet Boy says no, and that they never let anyone check in before 1pm.  So we pulled around the corner, much to Valet boy #2 dismay and my husband went into check and I moved the car as planned.  Oh imagine, we were allowed to checked in and I pulled back to Valet.  (Note:  Valet was not busy, they were all standing around)  

Bell Service:  This has been this way for awhile, but it is the dumbest thing ever!  So Bellman unloads our luggage to cart and even though we already know our room number and are headed directly there, the cart must be taken to the staging area and we must call to request it from our room.  Bellman says ""It won't be me that brings it up"" meaning tip me now.....Call, get luggage, tip Bellman #2.  We have done this before, so now we know to split the tip.  

Check Out:
Called the Bell desk to see if we could request the car and bellman at the same time.  Answer, No.  So when we are ready, my husband goes to get car brought around (Valet out can be backed up).  He texts me as soon as he hands ticket to valet and I call Bell Service.  When he gets to the room, loads luggage.  I tell him that my husband already has the car (I can see Valet and can see my car) at Valet out.  He says ""It won't be me that brings it out (again stupid).  So 1\/2 tip and I head to my car.  I hand my luggage ticket to the Valet, he tells me that I need to go to the front Valet??  I tell him my car is sitting right there....hesitates say I'll call for it.  (Now we have done this before and the staging area for the luggage from bell service is right behind them).  After at least 30 minutes and asking them multiple times (they weren't busy) where my luggage is, it finally shows up.  We have done this many times, this way and usually the check out Bellman, says I'll meet you at your car, or why don't you just come this way (service elevator) and goes directly to car.  

This was by far the worst experience we have ever had here, Rude Valet both in and out.  Bell Service needs to be more accommodating, if a person already has a room, or already has their car there is no reason for 'two' different Bellmen!!  

Elevator Security:  We have no problem with there being Elevator Security, but what good is Security if it's only there part time??  They were there some mornings, not there at all during the afternoon, and there one night, but not the next night.  What good is part time security?  It wouldn't take a genius to figure out when they are there and when they are not.

It's nice, it's updated, but the stellar service I expect from that caliber property just wasn't there.

Check-In was a complete ZOO.  The cordoned-off line snaked back and forth, with easily 100 people waiting, and there were 3 check-in agents.  THREE!  That process took over 45 minutes.  Although once I got to the counter, the Agent was friendly, chatty, and pleasant.  I asked for, and received, a comp upgrade to a larger, corner room with a Strip View and two windows.

The room is nicely appointed in contemporary fashion, which I love.  The bed was amazingly comfy, and the white sheets and duvet were clean and fresh-smelling.  Our view looked across at the Venetian from one window, and the other window was over the Pirate's Lagoon, where the free show, ""Sirens of T.I."" is performed multiple times nightly.  This was cool for us, since we are night people, but if you're not (why are you in Vegas?) the show has loud pyrotechnics and fireworks until 11pm.

Unfortunately, one night we were trying to get in a nap between daytime activities and nighttime activities, and the Cable TV was out.  This required four separate visits, in and out, over a 3 hour span, by maintenance and then the cable company.  They were very nice, but it was an inconvenience for someone trying to sneak some sleep into a Vegas Vacation.

Again, though, TI was generous with their comps, and we received a Buffet for Two comp as a result.  (Granted, I had to ask for it, but the front desk manager was forthcoming.)  (Also on that note:  The buffet wasn't even worth the free meal.  It was utterly awful. See my review)

The property is middle-of-the-road for Vegas Strip hotels.  It's not old and run-down like Excalibur or Circus, Circus, but then, it's twice the price.  And it's nowhere as nice as the Wynn or the Bellagio, but it's half the price of those.  So - Quite clearly Average.  (Do watch out for those pesky ""Resort Fees"".  If you book on the phone, they make it seem as if it's a one-time, per person fee.  It's not.  It's $20, PER DAY, PER PERSON.  Typically sneaky, and common at Vegas Hotels.)  Also: THE POOL WAS CLOSED!  We paid a resort fee to hear ""Yeah, but you can drive over to the Trump and use their pool""?  I don't think so.  Inexcusable, T.I.

The restaurants leave MUCH to be desired.  They have a deli, but why would you eat there when the Carnegie is a shuttle-tram ride away at the Mirage?  The buffet, as we've discussed, was disgusting, and the breakfasty-cafe place was ridiculously overpriced, even for the Strip.  ($14 for two eggs? Really, TI?)  Lastly, they have a Pho restaurant.  A Pho restaurant that serves Tripe but calls it Tendon (They are NOT the same thing!) and charges $19 for a bowl that would cost you literally $6 anywhere else in the US.  I'm just thankful I sampled it at the comped buffet rather than paying for it!

So overall, the property's rooms are clean and comfy, and at least they comp freely.  It's centrally located smack-dab in the middle of the Strip.  If you catch a fabulous deal, as we did, ($60 a night including Resort Fee) then it's probably a fine place to catch your Zz's in Vegas.

If you're looking for that signature Four-Diamond service, spend a little more and go to the Bellagio or the Venetian or the Wynn or.... you get the idea.",1,0,0

The rooms in TI are big and very roomy and the few times we got room service while getting ready and coming home hammered proved to be worth every cent. 

The restaurants are also top of the line in this hotel. The buffet has the most amazing cobb salad, and is a must no matter how much other food you've stuffed down your face.

The Manager at the front desk who listened to my complaints was kind enough to look around as I explained what I was displeased with; even looked at his cell phone a couple of times. The front desk manager was a younger guy, round in face and body with dark hair; he was the perfect example of someone who should be washing dishes or taking out the garbage because very simply he should NOT interact with other people. My complaints were about how we were greeted, to our room and continued on to the general attitude of all the staff. In every store we went employees were constantly checking their cell phones, not really listening to you or treating you with an ""oh great an interruption to our conversation just walked in."" I was surprised that the Manager had the same attitude, when I informed him that I would not ever return to his hotel, he simply stated he would give us a comp to The Coffee Shop or Buffet to our choice but didn't have much else to say. I was encouraged to go speak to managers of the different areas of the hotel I had issue with, but that was it. Please see my reviews of the other locations within the hotel. 

The hotel Lobby - No sign or indication where to check in, but the ""Check Out"" counter was HUGE and the first thing you see when you enter... I guess that is because people are more encouraged to leave this establishment then enter. Stale smoke was in the air, every staff member sighed, looked at their phones and tried to get you to leave quickly... for us it meant we had to return because we received the wrong package, and when we informed them we were told we couldn't be helped and we had to go to the Mystere counter and they would have not just our appropriate 2 free buffet tickets but our Mystere tickets, of course they took back the initial package they gave us with the 2 for 1 buffet and Cocktails. Our room was clean, the staff who cleaned was nice, anyone of them should have been promoted to manager, we were in room 6073. 

While at the Blackjack table, they increased the dollar amount while I was at it, later I found out when a table is empty they lower the minimum then increase it as soon as 1-3 people sit down, and at one point I needed to hit a cash machine and informed if I left I would lose my lower Minimum. I was lucky to see the cocktail waitress once an hour, and she would either get orders or drop off drinks, not both at the same time. So if she was dropping drinks off at the table and someone tried to order she said ""No, I will be back"" and she'd come back maybe 20min later. One of the dealers who was at the table though nice had a bit of a superior attitude and kept informing two British men who were playing that she deserved a tip, and would take a portion of their winnings and declare ""That's yours this is mine"" and pop it in her tip box, although they didn't protest to it never in a million years would I have put up with that. She didn't try it on anyone else, but it certainly wasn't appropriate. The amenities at the TI (Treasure Island) are nil, there are 4 places to eat that I saw, a costume jewelry store, Mystere (which has to be the worst Cirque Du Solei show I have ever seen (and I've seen 3 others which I loved). If I go back to Vegas I would NEVER return to this hotel, and I would also mention that most of the hotels now are owned by the same companies, which means there is no competition; if you stay at one and have a bad experience they just expect you'll stay at another they own. The TI is horribly located, has no real redeeming features and the staff from the front door, servers, bar tenders, restaurants all the way to the manager would rather ignore you then show you that they're pleased you chose to have a vacation in their establishment.",4,1,0

nice to have a small frig in the room.... the A\/C is tricky.  seemed to be hot& stuffy or FREEZING!  the upstairs hallways are ALWAYS FREEZING!  i carried a sweater with mii everywhere JUST for th TI hallway by the rooms!  :(

the pool was nicely sunny until 5p-ish.  Other hotel pools in LV are under shadows of their neighbors towers by 2\/3pm :(
the DJ by the pool was a bit LOUD!  he did all right until he played a song about Murdering Children.  not exactly my cup of tea while i'm trying to relax.

The only idiot\/rude person I encountered was at the hotel front desk at 1a and 2a on friday night.  TI allowed and profited from a wedding reception held in the pool area after it was closed for the night.

after 2:10am, I was P.O.'ed!!!  when I called back, the IDIOT at the Front Desk tried to tell mii the hotel ""can't do anything about it"".   HOW ABOUT NOT ALLOWING the SALES DEPT. to BOOK PARTIES that WILL DISTURB OTHER GUESTS??????

We ended up going downtown to another casino to play where the Video poker machines much better.

I prefer the Venetian or Mandalay from past experience. Despite that, the basic queen suite rooms were nice. Decent view of the strip, and it felt more upscale then most of the casino's in the same price range.

I would honestly rate T.I. four stars. Except for one little thing. I know all the kids these days are charging a ""resort fee."" Most places are $10-15 depending. T.I adds an extra $30 resort fee onto your room price every night. They don't advertise this, unless your a super lawyer and actually read the 37th paragraph of the terms and conditions when booking online.

T.I. is alright if your looking for a mid-strip casino, just expect to pay what you would at the Venetian, without the same service.

I told her we had about 20 rooms booked for all our guests and we had purchased the pirate ship so we were giving them thousands of dollars of business and they could not comp 600 bucks, she did not even bother looking into this. 

Next we reserved a room on a floor for my wife's mom with all of our other guests. This was really important to her that she be on this floor and we expressed this when we checked in. Her mom got there a few hours later and they gave her room away so her mom had to be on another floor. 

Next at the wedding we had brought our own song for the end music and we tested it the day before on the chapel and it worked on their system.

This review is specifically in regards to Tiara. On top of the THOUSANDS of dollars I have spent on my wedding here at the treasure island and the $2000 I spent on my cabana today alone I am disgusted by the lack of hospitality this hotels offers. On our way out of the pool at closing time Tiara started screaming to innocent bystanders telling them to get the F*$! Out. We were in complete shock by this behavior and told the woman to calm down. She then started screaming at us with profanity. I told her to not speak to us that way and she said she didn't care. 

I tried to complain at the front desk and they said there is nothing they can do since they do not own the pool? 

This is disgusting. Don't ever stay here. There are much cheaper places on the strip with nicer employees.

The woman who was working at the front desk @ 3:30 AM Saturday, May 25, 2013 from Chicago, IL (that was all I could get from her name tag on account of how tired my husband and I were making the 9-hour journey to LV) - YOU DESERVE TO BE FIRED.  YOU DESERVE NOTHING BUT THE LACK OF KINDNESS\/CONCERN YOU SHOW TO OTHERS.  

But let me start from the beginning: my husband and I decided to go to LV for a nice, relaxing Memorial Day weekend.  We decided to drive from San Jose, CA because our original plans fell through last minute - typically this is a 7-8 hour drive, but because of all the traffic from vacation-goers, and deciding to leave during rush hour (after my husband got off of work), our drive ended up taking over 10-hours.  Fast forward to arriving at the hotel: we arrived at 3:30 am, early Saturday morning and to say that we were exhausted is an understatement.  There were plenty of front desk personnel for so early in the morning (or late at night) and there were plenty of people checking in as well.  After waiting in line for about 10-minutes, it was our turn to check in.  We were met with a standard greeting and asked our names for the reservation.  After giving the front desk personnel our name, she proceeded to get on the phone and to check to see ""if rooms were available"" - even though I had called two days ahead and told them we would be arriving after 1:00 am.  At the time I called the gentleman on the phone told me there was nothing to worry about and that he would include a note on the reservation.  After the woman got off the phone, she told us the ONLY room they had available was a KING, SMOKING room.  This was TERRIBLE news being that I am EXTREMELY ALLERGIC to cigarette smoke.  Now before someone goes on to rant ""why would you be in Vegas when you're allergic to cigarette smoke???"" - I try my best to avoid those who are smoking and I don't gamble, so I never stay in a casino more than to just walk through... other than that my husband and I chose to drive around most of the time and we only go to Vegas for the shopping - this cuts down my exposure to offsetting my allergies (these are personal decisions we make and planning ahead like this helps tremendously for our lifestyle choices).  

Back to the story: the woman proceeded to tell us there was ""absolutely nothing"" she could do and did not even offer any other offer (I wouldn't have minded paying extra for the night to get us out of smoking room - but she made it seem like it wasn't even an option).  Meanwhile, the man checking in next to us was offered a SUITE when the other front desk staff told him the only room available was a smoking room - he didn't want a smoking room because he had children (totally understandable).  When I told her I was allergic to cigarette smoke, she asked to give her an exact medical condition and she would ""look it up.""  When I told her allergies were a health condition in-in-of-itself, she went on to say, ""well I get itchy eyes too around cigarettes.  It's too bad.""  THIS MADE ME SOOOO MAD.  I reminded her I called a couple nights ago and asked them to make a note - my exact words were: ""I asked you guys to make sure we would be accommodated.""  THEN SHE SAYS ""No, not ""you guys"" it has nothing to do with me - you told the company and they are currently out of rooms.""  SHOCK.  That's how you treat customers?  That's what you say?  Do you enjoy throwing salt on the wound?  My husband and I were so tired and she wasn't worth making a scene over... but the result?  I currently have an infection in my eye stemmed from ""an allergic reaction"" and my body is in hives.  Thank you Treasure Island.  Or specifically lady from Chicago, IL - since she obvious doesn't work for Treasure Island but works for herself.

Not a single person at the front desk showed any empathy or said I am sorry for your bad experience. Instead these poorly trained staff embers just kept saying I can have a smoking room or nothing. This arrogant attitude starts at the top believe me.

The check in process was easy enough and the in-house shows were quality at a reasonable price. 

There just wasn't anything that stood out regarding service, dining or atmosphere for me that I would describe as exceptional. 

What was etched into my memory, which will ensure I do not return as a guest, was their apparent policy of ensuring as many ""touches"" possible of luggage by service staff and the childish behavior of at least one bellhop. 

There seemed to be a policy in place of passing off service to several folks each of whom expect a tip of some sort. 

But the proverbial icing on top of the cake was in departing the casino, having already paid a bellhop $5 to take luggage down to my vehicle, once loaded another bellhop stood there like a 15 year old waiting on an additional tip. When it became clear to him there was none to be had, he stomped around yelling -- and I quote: ""Yeah, go home! We don't want you here ... just go the heck home.""  

To be clear, in departing the casino their ""touches"" rule suggested that no less than four folks were seeking a tip: 1) The initial bellhop which we tipped the $5 for picking up the luggage and taking it down to the vehicle departure area; 2) The head bellhop\/valet rep at the departure point who oversaw vehicle and luggage ops; 3) Second bellhop at the loading point who actually loaded the luggage; and 4) the valet who brought the car around. 

Now, is there a true ""touches rule"" in place at Treasure Island Casino and Hotel? Probably not, but they put guests in a very uncomfortable position due to the way they manage services. 

I'm typically a very generous tipper ... so much so that my better half normally gives me a lot of grief for dispensing the kind of money I do. However, even I can't afford to support the entire staff during a simple checkout and departure. 

Bottom line: Given that Treasure Island offered little in the way of a ""special"" customer-service experience, my lasting impression will be that of an overweight bellhop standing behind my vehicle at departure carrying on like a child throwing a temper tantrum. And given the depth of competition in Vegas, I will be all too happy to look elsewhere for my next stay. 

Minus the bellhop, I would have given Treasure Island two and a half stars.",6,0,0

I believe that for the price, service, and quality of accommodation, it's one of the best deals on the strip! Of course, we have yet to stay at many other hotels, but we find this to be the safest option, knowing what we're paying money for. 

First of all, I have found deals online through Expedia\/Booking.com\/etc for $120\/night on weekends in April and June and simply called the hotel directly so they can match my price. That way the booking is straight through the hotel. They have actually beat those prices and included free tickets to the buffet and champagne for the birthday girl. Awesome!

The rooms are always very clean, upgraded, and we've gotten Strip views by checking in before noon. There is an option to check in sooner, but you have to pay for that and I don't see the point.

 In the summer it gets very hot, so it's always so nice to come into an air conditioned room with crisp, clean sheets. 

Also, it is VERY convenient as a woman to have a CVS located inside the hotel.

I'm a bit of a design snob, and I was fairly pleased with how our room looked.  My only qualm with our room was that there was no ventilation in the bathroom (at least not in ours), so it got steamy in there VERY quickly.

The casino is a little smokey and confusing to get around (both of which are to be expected), but there was a vast assortment of games.  I'm not much of a gambler, so we didn't spend a lot of time in here.  TI also pipes in a delicious-smelling fragrance of sugar cookies (or something similar) into the casino.  I would have that scent in my home if I could!

The buffet was... eh.  There are better around the strip for the same price.  There's actually no phenomenal dining in TI, to be honest.  There IS, however, a Starbucks right outside the front doors, and there's a direct walkway from TI to Fashion Show Mall, and the mall has a big food court.

OVERVIEW: Treasure Island is in a terrific location.  The hotel is fun and lively, and isn't stuffy.  The pricing is mid-range, and is a good ""bang for your buck.""  I recommend it!",1,0,0
