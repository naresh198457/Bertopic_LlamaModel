We went here for Sunday brunch. It is to be expected that they were packed. The guy who took my name said it will be around 25-30 minutes wait. He was awesome at what he does by the way. He kept us updated the whole time and he explained to anyone who walks in that the time is just an estimate and that it is not guaranteed. When we were finally seated, our waitress Jasmine was really nice and attentive. My coffee cup was never close to being empty. The manager would also stop by to check on us and ask us if we need anything else. This place really knows how to make their customers feel at home. 

We ordered eggs Benedict, a pancake and an order of biscuits and gravy. It was nice of Jasmine to give us a heads up about their gravy.  Their gravy is not regular gravy. It has bacon bits and maple syrup in it. It sounded interesting so we gave it a try. It was so delicious! It was creamy and rich but not too heavy. The biscuits were crispy so it blends so perfectly with the creaminess of the gravy. The pancake was not dense and had a good texture. The benny was also amazing. The eggs were seasoned well and the bacon was cooked until it is crispy but not dry\/hard. The hash browns were to die for! It was crispy on the exterior but was still soft and moist on the insides. 

I highly recommend this place. Good food and good price.",3,1,2

I had steak and eggs and the niece had the vegetarian omelet. I would choose the hash browns over the home fries. It was the best we ever had. Make sure to have them extra crispy.

When we first started coming here the place was exceptional! We loved it for breakfast! Then it just started seeming very inconsistent. 
They would offer peppers with your potatoes and then they started up charging if you wanted it. Understandable.
The steaks tho! Omg. The first few times we went they were nice and juicy and tasted fresh. Now.....they're tough and very poor quality. I'm not a fan of their biscuits and gravy, it has a weird taste and texture to it. Last few times our steaks were overcooked, poor quality and horrible. Eggs were also undercooked and toast wasn't even toasted. 
It's unfortunate because we loved this place. Now I don't even go there.",2,0,2

I was expecting more after reading the reviews, but to me there was nothing special about it. Coffee served in small mugs, which was Ok only so long as the refills came frequently, and for the most part they did. French toast OK (when I drenched it in syrup), and the bacon was good. Home fries a little disappointing, pretty much square french fries--I should have upgraded with the peppers and onions add-on. Mushroom omelet also OK, but the mushroom pieces were not as big and plentiful as we've seen elsewhere.

First off, I must give this disclaimer, the pancakes are HUGE! Don't make the mistake I made and underrate them like I did. I could've easily filled up off a short stack. Not only are they big but they're fluffy as tasty. The eggs and sausage was great as well. Coffee tasted amazing! The waitress even gave us cups to go.

The new location is more roomy. It had been a few years since I've eaten here. I'm not surprised they had to move to a offer location. Bcz this place was amazing the last time I was here. 
The new location is really nice and as you might expect with something this good. There was a little bit of a wait. But it's well worth it.

The coffee isn't the usual crappy coffee like you get elsewhere. It's really good.

These guy get down. The gravy is honest to God sausage gravy. The steak didn't seem to be some frozen patty with gravy to hide the lack of quality. 
The eggs were real eggs. Toast was buttery. I like my hash browns crispy. I got crispy. One of the guys even took a group picture of us. I think he may be he owner.

Came here with my hubs and boys for breakfast before heading back home.  The boys split a small stack with eggs and ham.  The pancakes are HUGE, ham steak very tasty (8 yo ate the whole thing minus my taste) and eggs enough for my 6 and 8 yo.  The hubs had the four egg omelet with cheese and ham.  Big and filling.  I had the French Toast, eggs and bacon.  The French Toast was really good topped with cinnamon and powdered sugar.  Over easy eggs cooked perfect and delicious, crispy bacon.  The drinks were constantly topped off.  I saw their chicken fried steak and had already decided that would be at my table our next stop here.

I must say, the staff here is amazing.  Our server, Kathy, was very sweet and attentive.  They have their business down pat with an abundance of employees hustling to get the food out quick and hot.  Plates removed promptly and everyone very friendly.  The gentleman taking names at the front appeared to be Mr. Mama himself.  LOL Very nice and friendly to all.  Thank you for a delicious breakfast to end our fun stay in Sin City.  We will definitely see you again!",2,1,1

Our table was near the kitchen, and the manager (a nice lady named Kat or Cat) came over, introduced herself, told us our server would be out promptly, and took our drink order.

I had the southern eggs benedict (mini chicken fried steak patties atop English muffins, with the specialty gravy), and the hash browns.

The eggs Benedict dish was ok. It was pretty standard.

The hash browns were light and crispy, without being greasy, just how I love them!

Their gravy is made with bits of sausage, bacon, and a little maple syrup, so there's a little bit of sweetness in there.

Our waitress was a nice lady named Claudia, and she was helpful, nice, and quick with service.

In the background, the manager Kat kept everyone on track and also pitched in as needed, a sign of a great manager.

The restaurant was clean and orderly, despite it being a busy and crowded weekend morning. The tables were bussed quickly, and there appeared to be a very smooth flow - great to see that at an establishment!

I'm giving this place 4 stars, because while the service and restaurant atmosphere was a shining 5, the food itself is only a 4.

Skip the crowded buffets of the Strip for a quieter and more comforting breakfast of Mr Mamas!",1,0,0

We came to Mr. Mama's because we saw it's voted #1 breakfast place on Trip Advisor. We liked it. I give 4.5 out of 5. 

The coffee is some of the best we've had at a restaurant. It's got a good kick and they kept it coming. You can have options like mocha and other things if you want. 

We opted for the eggs Florentine and the Mr. Mama's Favorite Chicken Fried steak. Both were good with distinct flavors and crispy potatoes. We had the hash browns and the home fries. The portions are huge and we took food home. 

The whole staff is super friendly and very proactive in making sure we had everything we needed. The manager even offered us To Go coffee or water.

Ordering: ordered 1\/2 order of biscuit and gravy, she asked if I wanted a sample (which I thought was weird but I said yes because it was made with maple) tasted it and it was pleasantly different. 

Food: came quickly and was delicious, ordered a side of bacon and was surprise how it was perfectly cooked to how I liked it. ( not over cooked not under cooked and still juicy). Pancakes were amazingly good, fluffy and sweet.

Service: she was very friendly and nice, never got irritated and never over asked.

Everyone makes you feel welcomed, our first time there and they made me feel like family. They've got customer service nailed!!! When we arrived we were told the wait would be 20-25 minutes and the hostess apologized. Every 5 minutes, she thanked us for coming and apologized for the wait. This is why we stayed, we had a busy schedule and most places that tell you 20-25 minutes turns into 45 minutes. Not here, we were seated in 15 minutes.The waitress, Loures, was so friendly; she kept my coffee cup full. I never had to ask for more coffee, her attention to small details was amazing. The owner, Nick, greeted everyone and THANKED them for coming to his place. Nick stopped at every table to check and chat. We never felt rushed. They also offer free Wi-Fi; all the tables seat four people so there's plenty of room to spread out.

Now for the food, everything was cooked perfectly. I like sunny side up eggs, where the yolk is warm and runny, but the egg must me cooked and that's exactly what I received. The pancakes were hot and fluffy not rubbery. The sausage patties are huge, took one home. My husband ordered, per the recommendation of our waitress, the country fried steak; the gravy was thick and tasty. The portions are large and the prices are very reasonable. Simple home cooked good food and friendly service is why you come here. They have a wide array of omelets and  I've heard the French toast is fabulous and I'm looking forward to trying these items next time.

The reason for a four instead of a five - I like going to places that have a signature dish or specialty - something you can't get anywhere else. The food is cooked to perfection here, but there's nothing unusual on the menu. You can go anywhere in town and get eggs, pancakes, omelets, and hamburgers, but if you want chocolate chip pancakes or blueberry pancakes or crab omelets, go someplace else, there's nothing fancy here. But if you want a clean friendly place, food cooked perfectly, and reasonable prices you can't find any place better. Definitely going back for breakfast and I'll have to try lunch.",0,1,0

Food was ok, gravy was great,  hasbrowns so good. Now the biscuits were not southern like i had hoped they were buttery but just small. One party's chili omelet was not eaten after a few bites the chili was sweetish tasting. Our server tried but she kept forgetting it was all little things no water refill, had to catch her for the check, no followup i know they were busy. So i went with the 3 stars mainly because of my view of the haphazard order management. I sat there watching while orders filled the small order window and the orders just sat waitresses would go over look at all the dishes and walk away this happened again and again. I watched a stack of 3 pancakes sit for a good 15 minutes then they were pulled and it looked like they became a stack of 2. If those were my pancakes i would have sent them back but they werent mine. Maybe the kitchen and wait staff just need some bonding time. Next time i am in vegas i would give them another shot.",0,0,0

Service - there's a little wait but it's to be expected , owner is very attentive and welcomes you upon entering , server is prompt

Food - Food is what you'd expect from a breakfast joint . No complaints from me . I'm an omelet kinda guy . I'm simple enough . I had the California omelet which was pretty tasty and the portion was huge . My wife had french toast and she enjoyed it

Final Thoughts - There can be a wait usually on the weekends and rush hour around lunch but if you don't mind being patient , this hole in a wall is a bargain . 4 stars",0,0,0

So we're not from around here, and we usually look on Yelp to help us find places to eat while we're traveling, sometimes even when we're home. There was three of us on this trip. But let me just tell you, this place is everything more than five stars! 

Our order
Chicken fried steak, over easy eggs, biscuit, gravy, home style potatoes. W\/ slice of orange. & a Dr Pepper.
French toast, ham, scrambled eggs w\/chesse, w\/ slice of orange. & orange juice.
Like I said there was three of us, with two orders it filled us up, and left overs. 
And the gravy is so good!!!! You might need extra.

We ordered the chicken fried steak because it was recommended, and it lived up to its expectations. The French toast, had a tad bit much of cinnamon but we still ate it because it was cooked so lightly and perfectly. 

Our waitress, was so friendly and nice, asked friendly questions after taking our orders, and told us to take our time after she collected our plates. 

This looks like a place that wouldn't be as packed from the outside shopping center, but I think all the cars were for this place. 

I would recommend this to anyone looking for a home style breakfast, with the right portion sizes. 
Absolutely delicious. And away from the strip with the right prices.",4,0,2

My boyfriend ordered the country fried steak... the crunch on that steak was perfect! 

Some of the best customer service I have EVER experienced. At one point my boyfriend dropped his fork and at least 4 workers were there to remedy the situation. My coffee never went cold. The conversation with multiple employees was effortless. I am more than impressed with this place.

We happened to just walk in here on a whim, and like everyone says, we were greeted at the door with a smile and a genuine greeting.  Our server was incredibly helpful, even advising that we might be ordering too much food, as their servings were big.  The food was prepared quickly and was delicious!  The wrap I got (Marty Wrap?) was HUGE and absolutely delicious.  Everything else we got was amazing.  During our meal, the same guy that greeted us at the door stopped by to see if everything was ok.  The prices are very reasonable.  We felt like we had made a GREAT choice.  At our departure, the same guy - must be the owner - opened the door for us and thanked us, and invited us back again.  One other thing, you can really see the 100% real customer service that all the employees feel.  When walking guests to their tables, the servers didn't just seat them and give them menus, there was conversation, eye contact, real caring.  That's rare these days.  10 thumbs up and 50 stars to this place.  I'll be back and will be happy to tell everyone I know about Mr Mamas.",1,1,1

Waited about 30 minutes to sit for a party of 2, server wasn't rude or friendly.. more towards the rude side. Under the menu sections I ordered the burrito which is under a section that says it includes toast so I asked for the toast and she rudely tells me it doesn't come with toast... confused I asked her why it was under a section that clearly shows that it comes with toast, she never explained to me just kept saying NO TOAST NO TOAST and yes she was definitely 100% fluent in english so I'm not sure why she just kept repeating that and ignoring my question.

my burrito was decent, nothing better than a typical breakfast burrito at del taco or your local mom and pop shop though, definitely not worth the drive from the strip or the wait",5,12,7

They engaged us in conversation, talked to my son and were prompt and efficient. My review is not based on my experience, but more so, the quality of the food. 

My boyfriend and I figured it out. We come from a place with the most amazing breakfast restaurant. We used to go there every Sunday. Then we moved. And we have never found another place like it. But if you live here, this probably IS the good breakfast spot. 

Anyway, I digress. My complaint is the food was not good. The has Browns were crispy on the outside and soggy on the inside- clearly cooked frozen. Boyfriend's omelet had very little of the things he asked for and an excess amount of spinach. The pancakes were actually ok but they were very bready.

We ordered the chocolate chip pancakes and steak n eggs. The chocolate chip pancakes are still fluffy and yummy. 

We ordered our steak medium rare, which to me is red and pink in the middle and grill on the outside. I got my steak and it was completely red inside! I like medium rare but not rare. It almost looked blue in my opinion. But the server was kind enough to take it back to get cooked a little more. I was a bit shocked that I could hear the cooks talking in the back about my steak and pretty much saying it was medium rare and instead they cooked it to medium. Oh wells! I don't like making a big fuzz. The steak was still flavorful when it came out the second time and this time it was medium, which was okay.

+ Service was amazing. Friendly (but not overly so) employees from start to finish. They were fun to talk to and seemed to really enjoy their jobs. 

+ Best hash browns I've ever had in my life. They look so normal and unassuming but once you take a bite, it's like a little piece of crispy potato heaven.

+ Great prices for what you get.

+ You can substitute toast for 1 pancake at no extra charge! The pancake is also delicious and pretty large as well. I couldn't finish mine.

+ As long as you walk in the door before closing (2pm on weekdays, 3pm on weekends), they will seat and serve you!

- The steak was too salty. It was tender though, so maybe it was just seasoned with a heavy-handed chef this time. 

- I called ahead of time to make sure we were ok to come in pretty close to closing time. Whoever answered the phone did not sound friendly but maybe that's just me.

So far, I've only had the Cali omelet, steak and eggs, and pancakes, all of which were bomb. Even the coffee is pretty tasty for a drip variety!

""I first ordered a coffee for myself, because nothing goes better with breakfast than coffee""
""I totally agree with you, what did you think?""
""I liked the coffee, it was well brewed, and it did not have a bitter aftertaste""
""I'm happy to hear that, did you order any food while you were there?""
""As a matter of fact, I did""
""What did you order?""
""I wanted to start off with my favorite, eggs benedict""
""Oh, that's my favorite as well, did you like it?""
""I sure did. I liked that the eggs were definitely the stars of the dish. The hollandaise was well made, and the poached eggs were perfect. The canadian bacon wasn't too overpowering, and helped elevate the dish. The english muffin was fresh and crisp, just the way I likes it. Also, the hash browns on the side were crispy on the outside, and hot and creamy on the inside""

""Are you really?""
""Yes I am. Were you able to try out anything else?""
""Yes, I wanted to see how your pancake and french toast stacked up""

""The pancake had a light and delicate texture, and wasn't too sweet. Honestly, one of the best pancakes I've ever had!""
""Mmmm, pancakes""
""I know, that's what I said!""
""How did you like the French toast?""
""Once again, it was great! It was thick, and wasn't soggy or dry, and the custard had a slight cinnamon taste that I enjoyed""
""How was the service, Mike?""
""What can I say? My server, Abby, was a complete rock star, friendly and helpful, can't ask for much more than that""
""Now I gotta ask you, Mike.. How come this wasn't a five star review? Everything seemed to be pointing in that direction""
""Well, there were a couple of minor issues. First, for some of the items, specifically the hash browns and the grits, I thought that they could have been seasoned a bit more aggressively. But, since there was a salt shaker at the table, that was easily remedied""
""And what else?""
""I ordered a burger medium rare and it came out mid-well. Plus, I didn't like the bun too much, it was a bit too squishy for my taste buds""
""Ah, I see""
""But I loved everything else, and this probably my favorite breakfast spot here in Vegas, and I will definitely come back!""
""Great! Can't wait to see you""
""Oh, and another thing""
""What's that, Mike?""
""Nah, I can't""
""It's ok, you can tell me""

My wife and I ate there this morning and had to wait over a half hour because of its popularity.  The restaurant is well run and well staffed.  I watched a very young man scrub, not wipe, table after table as he prepared them for their next customers.  The man in charge of staging the wait and filling the tables did a great job and even came around at the end of the meal to make sure we were pleased.

My wife had the breakfast wrap and thought it was excellent.  I had the western omelet and pondered the choice between hash browns and potatoes.  I chose the hash browns and was a little disappointed.  They had a watery taste and I suspect the were steamed on the grill with water and a cover to ensure they stayed moist.  The problem was all the water was not cocked out and it diluted the oil normally used to give top hash browns their best taste.  The western omelet was very good.  Next time I will try the potatoes.  The final bill was about $21 and well worth the price.",0,0,0

The comments on the food was the chicken fried steak was good and everything else was okay.  The owner meets and greets most and has to go home tired as I am not sure he stopped talking the whole time we were there.

A couple extra napkins later we ordered out meal and a few short moments later our meal arrived. I was incredibly impressed about the prompt service in a busy establishment. Every employee was personable. However, Mr. Mamas doesn't deserve five stars for personality; it's the food itself that makes this place a must go for breakfast. Usually, I'm very hesitant to order steak before noon. At most breakfast places ""steak"" means cheap n' chewy. This was far from the case. Every bite was savory and succulent. Even though they brought A1 steak sauce, it was far from necessary. In the end, the bill was affordable and everyone left satisfied. It is easily the best way to start the day in Vegas.

I had the French toast and the western omelette. French toast wasn't world changing, but it was good. I like salsa with my eggs. It costs 1.25 extra but it made my omelette extra delicious. Most of their omelette combos (includes regular toast and your choice of potatoes) cost less than $10, a great value. There doesn't seem to be a charge for substituting one veggie for another.   Tip: the western omelette doesn't come with cheese. No big for me, but I just assumed omelets came with cheese. 

I'm looking forward to coming back and trying their well-reviewed biscuits and gravy",2,0,3

Came in with a group of 4 on a Tuesday about 1140am. Appeared to be about 4-6 groups waiting. Walked in and asked for a seating time. Was told that it would be at least thirty minutes. Place isn't big but from the front counter you can see the entire eating area. There were at least 6 tables that I counted that were empty or needed busing. I asked why the wait was so long with so many empty tables. The answer I got was that there were many groups ahead. I told the hostess I understood that but why were there so many tables open or just in need of busing? I then asked what the bus time was on each table. The answer I got was that there were groups ahead of me. Again, I stated that I understood that but that if they bused the tables and seated at the open tables there wouldn't be a need of a thirty minute wait time. This was met with the hostess again telling me that there were people ahead of me. So I asked do you mean there are more groups then I can see waiting? The reply was we are busy. 

I'm sorry but there was no excuse I could see that these tables couldn't be cleared and groups seated in a much shorter time than thirty minutes. I'll take my money elsewhere.",0,0,0

Sadly though, as has become the trend, the food here was pretty mediocre.  Certainly not the worst food ive ever had, but it's not the life changing expirencing most people seem to be having.

The biscuits and gravey tasted like they were comprised of 2% milk, flour, and jimmy dean bacon sausage, with a dusting of black pepper and no salt for miles.

My friend had the chilli cheese fries, and commented that it tasted like Ragu from a can with ground beef.  No traditional seasoning and it was ""from a jar"" bright red.

Setting aside the food, the space is arranged nicely.  Tables are positioned in such a way as make it feel like youve got a nice amount of room to enjoy your meal.

The service was fast and attentive, which is a nice change from the usual off strip dining expirences we've had this far.

Food was delicious. Owner is super friendly. Spoke to us about how Mr Momas got their name too, real cool story.  Just ask him when you are here.  He's very approachable.  

Got the steak and eggs and home fries which looks like potato tators from Broasted Chicken out by Los Alamitos, CA.(which I would recommend anybody try at least once in their lifetime).

My lady got the ""Shortstack"" of pancakes, sausage, and eggs.  I also got her some home fries on the side too.

We also order the fruit bowl and the server made sure my lady got her strawberries.

Got some OJ here, normal stuff. 

Again, service was fast and top notch here.  I'm blown away. 

The yelp deal is worth the money.    Try this place if you are in Vegas, worth the money even without the yelp deal if you are sick of the buffet food at the Casinos. 

Plenty of parking in the plaza, but just make sure you don't park next to those ""lifted trucks""....they don't know how to drive and will probably damaged your vehicle when they are leaving by turning to close to your vehicle and clipping it. Just saying.

Will be back next time we are in Vegas again this year.

The gentleman who greeted and sat us was friendly and, quite simply, great at his job! He chatted with us while we waited for a table, asking where we were from and telling us about the delicious things on the menu.

Once seated, another friendly fellow thanked us for coming and asked us if it was our first visit, which it was. He recommended a few items and told us to let him know if we needed anything. I've since learned via yelp that he is the owner. His energy was amazing. We watched him make his way to every single table while we were there. 

Immediately after that, our server, Lourdes, welcomed us, told us about the specials, and made some recommendations. She was a perfect server. I drink lots of water and she was right there with the water pitcher before I even had to ask for refills. Throughout our meal she checked on us and paid attention to our needs. 

While waiting for our food, we watched how the dining area ran like a perfectly oiled machine. There was excellent communication between the front door folks, the servers, owner, kitchen, and bus boy, who wasted no time getting to each table when it was vacated. 

My husband had the chicken fried steak, which was the best he had ever had. My Greek omlet was terrific. Both the hash browns and home fries were fantastic.

The wait staff is on full court press, if you need something they have it at your table before you realize you need it.

Staff were super friendly and didn't mind chatting it up. The place ran very efficiently while we were there.

Maybe the church crowds hadn't arrived yet, I'm not sure. It wasn't horribly busy while we were there. They did have a ton of staff working, easily in the high teens which seemed like a lot for what seemed like a smaller place.
The food was really good. I had the Marty wrap, lots of great flavor and a balanced amount of every ingredient. The wife had the chicken fried steak, which was spectacular! I know because I tried a bite, or five. The steak was tender, flavorful and they were able to keep it crispy even after the wonderful gravy they top it with. The gravy had to be made in house, it tasted home made and had sizable chunks of sausage in it. Coffee tasted like standard swill, but we did notice it was freshly ground.

tl;dr

Our party of 2 arrived at 11:40am and were seated fairly quickly.  We didn't have to wait in line, but it seemed like they were about to hit max capacity.  The seats were still wet from them wiping it down and neglecting to dry the seat with a fresh towel afterwards.  

It took a good 5 minutes for our server to come to us to take our drink and food order. Our server seemed really distracted by her cell phone. At first I just assumed that they took orders on a device, but half way through our order she took out a notepad? Anywho, I ordered a eggs benedict and my friend ordered a swiss mushroom burger. 

And then we waited...and waited.....and waited... I finally flagged down our server at 12:20pm and asked where our food was.  She said that the eggs took a long time (really?) and that it's coming soon.  We finally got our breakfast food at 12:25pm - 40 mins after we arrived at the restaurant. Our server didn't even seem to realize that it took so long, and obviously no apology was even offered.

The only reason that I'm giving a 2 stars is because the food was delicious! But I would probably not return due to the excessive long wait and inattentive staff.

Our check arrived promptly when we were finished and they collected it fairly promptly as well. And then we waited.....and waited.....and waited. It took another 5 mins before they got my change back to me.",0,3,0

Background: I came here with a friend who is supremely picky but raved about the food. I set my expectations low but was totally blown away.

Atmosphere: the vibe in this place is very down home, down-to-earth, no fuss, no frills. It's simply (if somewhat sparsely) decorated and most of the tables are pretty much the same faux stone and wooden edged two-and-four-tops with pull out chairs.

Food: everything is generously sized, delicious and homemade. The pancakes are the size of dinner plates and the option of fresh fruit or chocolate chips. The biscuits and gravy were fantastic. With sausage gravy, it's easy to make it too heavy but this wasn't overwhelming. The home fries didn't come out of a bag and the hashbrowns with peppers, cheese, and gravy was a pretty inventive combination that sounds weird on paper but was actually great.

Service: our waitress Crystal was fantastic and rolled with it when we asked to split three different dishes. She was friendly and attentive and very personable. The manager, Cat, was also super great and friendly with everyone.

The friendliness and service begins before you walk in the door. The owner (Nick) and staff were very accommodating and welcoming.  I got the distinct impression that people actually LIKE working there.

Now for the breakfast fare. I had the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs like many Yelpers recommended and it did not disappoint. 
No need for the steak knife as you can cut it with your fork. 
My server (didn't catch her name ) offered a sample of the gravy before the breakfast order was sent to the kitchen; nice touch.

With countless options around town, this ranks right up there with Jamm's etc. I never made it to their old location, but this one seats almost double and there are no issues with parking and is quite family friendly.

ATTN: Out of towners!
Buffets? Forget about it! 

Get out and explore, you will thank yourself later, not to mention it is also easier on the wallet.

Nick: Thank you my friend, you earned a customer for life. (when I'm in town, that is!)

Here are all the pros:
1) There is hardly any wait even when you roll in at 9am on a Saturday morning! From where I live, there is always usually a wait! You'd be lucky to wait for only 20 minutes and not 60! 

2) The food is never bad. It's not the most creative in flavor, taste and presentation, but it always leaves me full AND the portions are generous! My mom and I always share an entree and we can barely finish ours especially since you get so much bread too.

3) The value and the prices are fantastic! For four people, three entrees and two coffees, our bill was $32.44!! That's $8.11\/pp! 

4) The service is always good! The owner is friendly, personable, and thanks you for being a customer!

The old location was, in a way, hidden from the masses, which kind of made it more secretive to loyal followers. This location is now out in the open. Mr. Mamma's has new tables, chairs, and a far larger location, which makes it far better than their last location.

I was very happy to see that there wasn't a change to their menu. I ordered the Cali omelette, which I've ordered in the past, and was not disappointed. The only thing I did differently, was had them add bacon to the omelette, which was only a $1.75 extra charge. If you want an actual side of bacon, with four strips, it's an additional $3.50. I paid $8.50 for my omelette with the old style hashbrowns, and a side of sour dough bread (you pick your bread). I also had iced coffee, which was $2.50 with unlimited refils. 

My friend ordered the French Toast and 4 strips of bacon. I felt bad for him, because my meal looked superior to his. He really enjoyed what he had though. 

Our waitress, Melissa, was excellent. She was very attentative and extremely nice. The owner is great, as well. He came over and talked to us for a minute and answered any question we had.

Once again if you treat your customers well and make them feel welcomed then you can have mediocre food and still maintain a great customer base for some people dont always need or search for good food they rather prefer great service. Lets get to the food

Cinnamon Roll (3\/5)- The Infamous Cinnamon Roll did dissapoint. I was expecting something out of this world but in the end it tasted like a sweet hawaiian roll with cinnamon and frosting if you know what i mean. It didnt knock my socks off. I personally wouldnt recccomend it.

*New ITEM* Corned Beef Hash And eggs w\/Toast- (4\/5)- The owner personally came over after this dish came out and said its homemade with Dill and seasonings added for the unique flavor. they made it crispy just the way a corn beef hash is supposed to be. it wasnt mushy at all. The only thing is I would really have to be in the mood for this dish so its not on the radar for something i would order again here for which i have had better.

Chicken Fried Steak n Eggs w\/toast- (4\/5)- Another dish which was made unique for their gravy. their sausage gravy had a very good flavor to it. i think if i were to compare it to something it would be italian sausage added to their country gravy it gave it a spicyness to it. This dish was my favorite but a very big portion which for the price was awesome. i even had leftovers because i couldnt finish it and for me i usually have no problem finishing my dish.
 
BTW i usually dont order hash browns over country potatoes but when you eat here they make a great hashbrown and i made that mistake when i ate here.

Here are my honest feelings:

""Blown away?""  No.

""Best breakfast in Las Vegas or anywhere?""  No.

Mr. Mamas is a good, American style diner with good, albeit generic, breakfasts.  Nothing special, but good.

I had eggs with sausage patties and a biscuit.  My wife had poached eggs with bacon and my son had a pancake with a side of bacon.

I have no complaints at all with the food.  All served piping hot and exactly how we ordered them.  Eggs were perfect and my son's pancaked with huge and very fluffy and the service was great.

But again, when I see words like ""blown away"" and ""best"" this means (to me) something a step above ordinary...  Something special...  Diners Drive-ins and Dives type of place.

Mr. Mamas is your classic American-style breakfast restaurant. The breakfast options here are classic and tastes just like home. There's nothing gourmet or special about Mr. Mamas, but the exceptional service, cheap prices and delicious breakfast makes this place worth a visit.

[Service: 5]

Mr. Mamas was my first stop in Vegas and boy, was it a great way to start my trip. I was greeted with a super friendly staff. Everyone was attentive and wanted to make sure we were having a pleasant dining experience. Our server, at the end, went out of her way to offer my bf and I water cups to-go, which was thoughtful and nice. The manager (or owner) was humble and SUPER friendly. He made us feel welcomed. I also noticed other workers consistently wiping down the tables and condiments at each table.

Come here for some good ole buttermilk pancakes, biscuits and gravy and egg benedicts. Everything we had was simple, homey and delicious!

Upon arriving, a friendly gentleman  came outside to greet us in the car park and welcome us in, once inside another gentleman (I believe the owner \/ proprietor)  welcomed us enthusiastically and we were quickly shown to a table. 

Our drinks order was taken as soon as we were seated at our table, and the drinks were delivered very quickly after that. As soon as our drinks order had been taken care of, our waitress (yet another friendly and enthusiastic member of staff) introduced herself and took our orders.

Food arrived fairly quickly, was well presented and most importantly tasted great.

We had Denver omelets, and a side of French toast, and a side of sausage. 

The sausage was the flat patty type, nothing spectacular, but good enough. 

The French toast was very nice, well presented, nice tasting, not overdone on the flavour and served with warm maple syrup, very nice indeed.

Finally the Denver omelet was excellent! Really nice and tasty, cooked just right, looked really appetising and neatly presented. I had potatoes with mine, which I also opted to have with peppers and onions (which turned out to be a good choice) the peppers and onions were very finely chopped and worked great with the sliced potatoes, which were cooked as close to perfection as you are going to find.

Overall the food was really enjoyable, and left me wanting to return to try other items on the menu. (which I certainly will) The thing that really stands out however, is the service! Everyone was so enthusiastic and friendly, it certainly puts you in a positive mood. I would be surprised if you can find anywhere else in Vegas with service to the incredibly high standard of Mr Mama's, absolutely perfect service!

I purchased a Yelp coupon to use during this visit, and unfortunately I was unable to redeem the coupon as it was showing as invalid when staff tried to process it. Even though this was clearly not the fault of Mr Mama's, staff were apologetic and the owner even offered to effectively give us our meal for free. I could not accept this as the meal was so good and I purchased a second coupon on my phone, which did work fine, now I just need to resolve the issue with the first one with Yelp. This shows how staff are willing to go above and beyond to make sure customers are happy. 

I look forward to visiting again and I would wholeheartedly recommend Mr Mama's to anyone!",0,0,0

Cinnamon roll - the first thing that came out and it definitely was a treat! It came out nice and hot, like it was fresh from the oven! The dough was soft, buttery, and melted in your mouth. It paired well with the coffee we ordered and set the tone for the rest of the meal. 

Cali Omelet - made with 4 eggs, topped with Pico, sour cream, and avocados. And comes with a side of potatoes, I got the home fries. Mmm the fries were delicious! They're diced up potatoes that are fried to be nice and crispy. Loved it! And the cali omelet hit the spot! Little old me could only finish a little more than half of my omelet. But it's so good, I would order it again!

Eggs Benedict - comes with 2 eggs Benedict with your choice of meat. My boyfriend picked sausage. I had a bite of it and it was pretty good! Also comes with a side of potatoes too. 

Bicuits and Gravy - a half order comes with 1 biscuit cut into half, a heaping scoop of gravy, and a side. We chose a sunny side up egg. They make their gravy with sausage and a bit of maple syrup. It was a little bland and too meaty for my taste. But the portion was huge, considering it was a half order.

But totally nice. He noticed I had gotten to the door before a couple, and was like ""Hey guys, I'm going to put her down first since she rolled up before you. Is that okay?"" Totally considerate, but I didn't wanna impede on another couple's date day, so I let him take their name down first instead.

My friends also got biscuits and gravy, cinnamon bun, and the Western omelette. The omelettes that we got were very bland so they needed a bit more salt or seasoning. My other friends did not like the taste of the gravy either. However, the home fries, toast, and cinnamon bun were very good!

As for the food, I always get the chicken fried steak and it is always delicious.  The batter is nice, crispy and adheres to the steak well.  The meat is also very tender.  The country style sausage gravy is creamy and has the perfect consistency with chunks of sausage.   It definitely tastes better than most of other breakfast joints.  My wife has tried their omelettes and they are always flavorful and fresh tasting.

My wife did not receive her toast she ordered, also  I did not receive the red peppers and onions on my home fries, I told the waitress she brings them in a small dish.

He didn't say anything else, like what can I do for you folks? For your bad service. When we said more about the bad service, the owner took our check and walked away with a attitude and said l'll take care of your check. It did seem to us that the owner didn't like to hear complaints. It showed us he is a very phony owner. In the past, he was a very friendly owner. Today, he showed us he has a attitude and doesn't care about his customers. We have been coming here a long time and now we know what the owner is all about.

The food was good too...fluffy pancakes, great wraps, burgers done really well.  This place is not fancy and you will not find truffle oil on anything, but you will be full, happy, and in a truly wonderful state of mind when you leave.

They haven't lost a beat with their newer surroundings, as they serve some of the best breakfast in the city while providing incredible service all at the same time.

Their new spot is one giant dining room space; complete with the retro black and white checkered floor tile (#1) and a number of tables for all groups and sizes. There is a TV playing in the corner for the morning crowd and the staff is usually warmly greeting folks as they come in and leave. The hustle and bustle in the back kitchen becomes hard to ignore; a subtle reminder for what most people (and I) are here to eat.

Their menu is practically exclusive to the quintessential American breakfast experience while featuring a decent number of other diner classics such as salads, sandwiches, and soups. I've been a sucker for hashbrowns and theirs is as good as any. Perfectly crispy, aromatic, and extremely complementary to any additional breakfast item. My last go around here was a magical plate of corned beef hash with two smooth and silky eggs over easy. I ordered a side of avocado to smear onto my toast, which was glorious in itself. Everything was so delicious, I was secretly cursing at myself knowing nothing like this exists where I live.

I took my time, polished off a glass of orange juice and just marveled how simple and wonderful these foods are. Sure, I had just finished a stint on the other side of the world and was basking in the nostalgia of hashbrown glory that I was experiencing at Mr Mamas, but the food only made me think of every other time I've been here in past trips, which were all excellent.

A huge shout out to the owners \/ management who go out of their way to make sure as customers that we feel every bit as wonderful as we did regardless of how many visits. On the front of their menu there is a (extremely cheesy) quote that reads: ""Our Place Will Put A Smile On Your Face."" Truth.

Review #3100 is in the books. To 5 stars and many more adventures in hashbrowns.

The bacon was the thick cut kind which was surprising  because most places cheap out with the super thin bacon.

Hubby & I were out and about the other morning (shocker). It's a good thing too since we were able to grab breakfast here. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table which I didn't mind. A busy restaurant usually translates to good food. This was absolutely true for Mr. Mama's!

I ordered the Spanish Omelet subbed with egg whites. It's an extra charge for egg whites, but that's standard. The omelet itself had Mozzarella and Parmesan cheese, spinach and avocados. Let me first say that the portions are HUGE! I only finished half of my omelet and took the rest home. It was sooo tasty too. Super cheesy and packed with layers of spinach.

Omelets come with a side of hash browns or ""house fries"". We both ordered hash browns, but Hubby switched to house fries later on. The name is misleading since they are actually seasoned potatoes. Anyways, both of our sides were good and came with a choice of toast as well. All for a fair price I might add.

Chicken fried steak and eggs isn't something I usually have for breakfast.  In fact, I had never had it for breakfast before having it here.  My mom occasionally made chicken fried steak when I was growing up, but we always had it for dinner.  It's rather a lot of food for breakfast, but Mr Mama's is cool with it if you don't finish it all.

I was really looking forward to this meal.  I had been thinking about their chicken fried steaks ever since I first tried one back in July.   Mr Mama's did not disappoint!

Last time I ordered the gravy on the side because I was concerned I might not like it.  Well, the gravy is outstanding, and I found I like it better served right on the steak.  Last time I got toast, and it was great.  This time I changed it up and ordered a biscuit instead.  SCORE!  The biscuit was outstanding!  And what made it really special was that they split the biscuit, then grill the insides to a crisp toasty finish.  Baby, that's some good biscuit!

The service, again, was absolutely wonderful.  I ordered hot tea.  My waitress made sure I had a fresh cup, a 2nd teabag and hot water half way through my first cup so my second cup would be ready when my first one was finished.   

I can't wait to visit Mr Mama's again.  As much as I love the chicken fried steak, I think I'll try something else on the menu next time.  All I know is, whatever I get, I'm definitely getting a little biscuit and gravy on the side.

I guess I was just expecting to be blown away (after seeing the reviews and lines out the door). I also got a cinnamon roll and I hated it. I didn't think it was fresh or delicious. Maybe I just got the wrong thing but I really didn't enjoy the food. I have to give this place four stars because they have five star service. They really do have great customer service, which in my book goes a long way.",0,0,0

Our server, Jasmine, was pleasant and helpful. Nick, Mr. Mamma himself, stopped by, too. The service was great.

I had the party melt and onion rings. They came out hot and tasty. My vegetarian friend had Mamma's Breakfast Burrito, they were accommodating and replaced the meat with avocado. He also tried the French toast. Everything was well presented, a good temperature and flavorful.

Everyone was very friendly and engaging, obviously knowing we were heading for a ride (Harley gear gave us away) we talked quite a bit about our upcoming adventure with (I assume) the owner. We truly felt like we were part of the family

I ordered Mamas Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs (my favorite breakfast) and my wife had Eggs Benedict.  The Chicken Fried Steak was one of the best I ever had, and the home made gravy was excellent.  My wife too was thoroughly impressed with her breakfast as well.

The CHICKEN FRIED STEAK & EGGS was the best dish of our group- nicely breaded, good gravy, but could have used some salt. The Greek Omelet and Veggie omelets were both just okay, both were eaten with a hefty addition of hot sauce because they were bland. The hashbrowns and homefries were both nicely crispy, but had no seasoning of any sort. Pancakes did not get finished, very generic. Biscuits were done nicely, gravy was good... after adding a hefty shake of salt.

Everyone helped out. Not just my table but everyone's. From a party of 2 to a party of 10 everyone seemed to get the same warm welcome and great service. The owner Nick (by form of a loud announcement which was awesome) congratulated my son on his graduation and ""bestowed upon him"" a cinnamon roll  (which was delicious). 

Now to the good stuff--THE FOOD. Every single thing that we got was delicious. Now with 10 people we got to try a lot of dishes. The gravy-out of this world. It has bacon and sausage-nuff said. My mom had a lunch plate with onion rings on it (I stole one when she wasn't looking ) best one I've had in a long time.

He interacted with everyone there asking how they were enjoying their meal. The pride he takes in his restaurant bleeds down to his employees as well. He stopped at our table and even shared a joke with my husband about Chicago and Michigan, and kept stopping by for chit chat which we enjoyed. When we were finished with our meal and he check to see how things were my husband asked him if they had corned beef hash on the menu, he lit up and said they did and how it's made from scratch and told him the care they take in preparation, we were pleasantly surprised that he said hold on let me get you a sample. His sample size was almost a portion and it was delicious. How may establishments gives you something for nothing? i don't know many that will, this is the type of customer service i look for in a place, his whole staff was friendly and attentive, makes you feel welcomed and appreciated for dinning there, and that is what he said when my husband thanked him for the corned beef was thank you for coming.

It was cooked to perfection, you just don't know how hard it is to get your steak cooked right the first time, while we were waiting on our food i noticed a waitress bringing someone their meal it was this huge burger and i have got to go back and try it, this is no processed burger(all their beef is angus) it looks like someone was in the kitchen with giant hands preparing the fresh formed patties.

""Welcome! We've been waiting for you!"" This guy is like a cousin that you actually want to see at family reunions. He was so sweet to my mom which I loved. Then our waitress was bilingual so that was an added bonus, bc my mom could speak to her more comfortably. But so far I haven't even mentioned how amaze balls the food was! I've include pictures of our incredibly flavorful omelettes. So generous with the avocado! But I gobbled up the french toast before I could take a picture. Did I mention I have a bit of an appetite? 

Anyway, the food was delectable and the service was completely delightful. Yelpers you didn't fail me. This place deserves the 5 stars!",1,0,0

I'm not generally a breakfast person and wasn't too hungry so two of us split a full stack of pancakes and neither of us walked out hungry. The other party both got steak and eggs and neither of them complained. 

There's nothing too fancy or incredible on the menu, just your basics done well. The host was friendly. The prices were decent. The food came out hot, it was pretty good and the service was on point as well. I had to ask for butter three times and each time I got my butter pretty fast. If you're doing regular pancakes I like to place a ball of butter between each pancake and let it melt with the heat, then hit the syrup...yelp tip courtesy of my arteries.

Doug got the Steak and Eggs; small rib eye steak with 2 eggs, potatoes and toast for $10. We both liked our food and I feel like the prices are cheaper than many breakfast joints in town.

A friend was coming into town and wanted breakfast with us so I suggested this place because of the ratings, they were so good! My expectations were high, and what we experienced was very poor. 

Upon walk-in, our friends were already seated but we weren't allowed to sit next to them or put any tables together because there was no room, even though we were willing to wait to put our tables together. That was not going to happen & we ended up sitting there, waiting for a table while our friends got theirs. I told the host that it was okay, although honestly it was an inconvenience. Once we were seated, opposite of our friends' table, his parents decided to take our table so that we could sit with our friends. 

Our server was Julia, who seemed rushed. I understand, there's a lot of people waiting to be seated; I saw several customers waiting outside as well, but we are the ones seated, we shouldn't be rushed; we waited our turn just as they are waiting theirs. Once we ordered our food, it came back to us in a fairly good time. I ordered steak & eggs with hashbrowns and so did my boyfriend. Unfortunately my plate had my steak & eggs but it had thinly cut potatoe wedges\/fries and I told her I asked for hashbrowns, she assumed my boyfriend asked for the thin cut wedges and told us to swap our steaks. She literally told us to swap our steaks. We had different eggs too, why would we swap plates????

My boyfriend said he ordered hashbrowns too so she left to get a separate plate of hashbrowns and said that now we could have both. (Although I didn't touch a single potato wedge thing.)

She frequently checked in on us.... A little too frequently to the point where again, it made us feel rushed. She spoke quickly, came and went quickly, and came too much. 

The food here was mediocre in comparison to other breakfast places. I have had better steak and eggs & I honestly don't plan on coming back here again. It's not terrible, but I didn't have a very nice experience and the food wasn't all that great either.",12,13,7

Mr. Mama opened the door and practically met us in the parking lot to tell us how happy he was to see us there. He then made some very friendly chit-chat. That was all well and good, but I was really there for the food.

I really enjoy a big breakfast, so my wife and I ordered enough food to get to $30 so we could use the $15 off $30. I had an omelette, bacon, eggs, coffee & OJ. While the portions were HUGE, and I almost ate it all, the food was a bit on the bland side. The maple syrup and salt saved the day, although the bacon was VERY tasty.

I was totally craving one morning a Jersey-style diner experience. In terms of the food, Mr Mamas fits the bill - no frills, no nonsense, down-to-earth breakfast comfort food. Pancakes were huuuuuuge, fluffy and yummy. Seriously, no complaints about the food here.

I was, however, disappointed with the service, which I expected to be spectacular given all the prior raving reviews. We were seated right away, but then basically ignored for the next 10-16 minutes. Ten minutes passed, and we attempted (and succeeded on our third try) to wave down a waiter. We asked if we could order since no one has come by our table yet. His asked us who our waiter was, which from our perspective was an odd thing to ask because had we known that, we wouldn't have stopped him. We said that we didn't know since literally no one has come by to greet us, or give us water or take a drink order. ""Well I don't know who is taking care of your table today, you need to ask the person who is responsible for your table"" was his answer before he walked off. I get it, he was a young server and maybe did not know any better, but then we tried waving down someone else and 2-3 times we were either rebuffed or outrightly ignored. My mother commented that she saw someone by the cashier acknowledge her (a manager, perhaps?) by nodding and waving in her direction that he would get to her shortly, but another 10 minutes passed and he never did. 

Our waitress finally came around the 20-minute mark, but the damage was done. My parents, who rarely dined out, felt ignored and unhappy with the experience. My hubby, who needed to be back on the Strip within a certain time for business, asked the waitress typically how long it takes for food to get out. Her answer was that she ""didn't know"" - apparently a popular refrain. Just because a place in Vegas serves and looks like a Jersey diner, doesn't mean it operates with the efficiency of a Jersey diner - lesson learned for this naive tourist.

I wouldn't mind coming back here again and giving it another shot, but doubt i will return since my family was unhappy with the treatment. Unfortunate, because the food was very decent and prices fair.",5,2,4

Most of all another great option on the west side of town. Apparently Mr Mamas moved from there old location but thankfully just up the road so still on my side of town! I have came twice and both times the experience was awesome. My first time came with another yelper Suzy H for no shocker another recovery meal from tri training. Talk about packed for lunch. Really both my visits lunch cross your fingers get seat. If you do get seat count on great experience from customer service, great food, and an owner that not often see HANDS on guy. He literally constantly walking around too every table making sure everything on point. Not just checking on customers. I felt like knowing that not chain believe just family run restaurant. The owner comes off very very genuine, totally asking for feedback, friendly, and sense that treats every customer like your part of his family. One of the first things notice about the dining room feels more like this big open family dining room. Not many booths just all old school tables and chairs. They do have some television around the room. Really not much going on with interior design. 

My first trip order the breakfast burrito. I enjoy the size of it. It not small and it packed with all the good things in life. Eggs, Sausage, Onions, Cheese, and few more things. The salsa that comes with it. If I could would get bowl of that with chips and be in chips\/salsa bliss. The second trip ordered the chili cheese omelette. Again size is not problem when you come to Mr Mama. All the food they serve is generous portion size. The chili something that Mr Mamas is famous for or least on the menu that the impression I got. It was good. Truth had better. The combination of the chili, cheese, and stuff in the omelette worked awesome for me! The fried potatoes believe they called it. Ah nothing special. The omelette worked more for me then the potatoes..

They do offer free drink with your yelp checkin.

When my sister & her BF were in town the family decided to come here upon my brother's suggestion.  Place was full but we were able to get a seat pretty quickly, as it appears they turn the tables around pretty quickly.  There's really nothing to this place from décor standpoint, in fact purely from the looks of the interior it's tough to expect a lot out of it.

Six of us sat and ordered a variety of stuff.  I would say from food standpoint it was as good as any excellent breakfast joints.  Service was great with staff that seems to enjoy working there, including the very enthusiastic owner who ups the mood of the whole diner with his running around and conversations.  It's really the highlight of this place.

With prices also being reasonable, I would come here again if I happen to be in the area or if I'm heading out for breakfast with mum & bro, since it's near their place.  And therein lies my 4-star rating, instead of 5.  If I'm in the mood to go out for breakfast, am I thinking immediately, ""I want to drive 20 minutes to go to Mr. Mamas""?  Well, no.

Disappointed no booths, only tables and no kids menu or choices\/no crayons. Waitress forgot to use yelp deal I gave her. All else was good and we will be back.",3,1,1

And I just wasn't expecting it in Las Vegas, which is definitely not the South! The only thing I enjoyed was the lemonade and the ""Home Fries"" which are basically diced potatoes. I opted for $2 extra to add peppers. And it was decent. I will say that the price range was very good. I just wished that the food was as well.

Chicken fried steak was just okay (because gravy was tasted like plain flour)

The thing that wasn't that great were the way the hash browns were cooked.  They were crispy on the outside but the inside was more of a mashed potato texture.  Not sure if you have to ask for them to be extra-crispy.  Hard to gage that.

The restaurant was also impeccably clean - our table was immaculately set, all of the condiments were wiped totally clean (even the syrup bottle and these can get a little gross and sticky and diners), and the condiments were in a caddy on the table with all of the labels facing forward. 

For breakfast, I got the eggs florentine and added ham. I also got a side of hash browns and a single pancake (I was hungry). When it comes to hash browns and pancakes, I think they're hard to screw up but also hard to make shine and in both cases Mr. Mama's versions of these dishes were a cut above the rest. Both were very tasty and worth ordering again. The eggs florentine was probably the only area of opportunity for improvement. For the most part, the dish was tasty and plated well, but the spinach was really under-seasoned and there was enough of it that it made the entire dish taste a little bland. 

My partner got the chicken fried stake and it was delicious. I stole a bite and then kept finding myself taking more and more because it tasted so good. Yum.

The only complaint that I have is that their water sucks... It's tap water & I can really taste it lol but I'm a drama queen when it comes to water so yeah. 

The service is really good tho! The servers are really nice & will check up on you frequently!",0,0,0

I ordered coffee and was excited to be able to take fresh cream with it, kind of a rarity in Vegas diners! Once we had decided on what to eat, we didn't wait long before we were served our meal. It was not only excellently prepared (I may have had the best poached eggs of my experience) but there was great care put into selecting the ingredients to be served.

I had the California Omelet, which I turned into a ""scramble"" because I'm weird. It was pretty standard: scrambled eggs, some pico, some avocado, and cheese (I left out the sausage). The meal came with hash browns and toast. Also adopted a couple bites of a pancake along the way from the plate next to mine. The food wasn't bad, it just wasn't very memorable. Then again, my order was about as plain as possible, so maybe that was my fault. 

The service was amazing though. There were more staff then customers when we walked in, and that held true until we left. I'm always impressed when owners\/managers aren't afraid to overstaff, and it really makes a difference in the level of hospitality and the overall feeling of the place. Every single employee, including who I believe was the owner, was constantly looking around for a way to serve the customers. If I looked up from my plate or my conversation, someone would immediately walk over to see if I needed anything. They even asked if we wanted our picture taken.

The staff was friendly and kept on checking on us periodically. We had ordered a traditional eggs Benedict with Canadian bacon with a side of hash browns and Chicken fried steak with a side of hash browns and toast. The eggs Benedict was delicious; the English muffin was toasted to perfection and was a great contrast to the poached egg and the creaminess of the yolk and the hollandaise. The Canadian bacon added the bit of saltiness and extra bite the dish needed. For the CFS, it was phenomenal. The steak was tender and juicy, while still being crispy. The country gravy was filled with sausage and a hint of maple syrup, adding a great flavor to the already flavorful steak. The hash browns that accompanied both dishes were very crispy and well prepared as well.

That should be everybody's motto. I'm one happy dude when I'm served good food with great service. It's no secret.  Mr. Mamas is a very popular spot in Las Vegas for breakfast.  There's usually a wait because the whole town loves this place.  Mr. Mamas is not just a local favorite, tourist and travelers come here too.  You'll even count the amount of cars with California, Arizona, and Utah license plates in the parking lot. The Manager stated that over 65% of their customers during the weekend come from California.  That's amazing considering that Mr. Mamas is not even on the strip.  

I first experienced Mr. Mamas a couple of years ago and what sticks out the most is their excellent customer service.  Based on the Yelp reviews, I'm not the only person that mentions the A++ service here.  There hasn't been one time, not one, when I ever touched the door.  Someone from Mr. Mamas, usually the Manager Shawn, opens the door as I walk in and walk out.  Shawn leads by example and his enthusiasm towards his customers is also duplicated by the employees here.  It's guaranteed at Mr. Mamas that you will be welcomed on the way in, checked on during your meal, and greeted on the way out. And if you're getting coffee, don't worry about staying caffeinated.  They are like ninjas here and will top off your cup without you even noticing.  Ordering is simple and fast.  Getting your food is even faster.  But don't let their speediness discourage you from staying and chilling out.  Mr. Mamas encourages you to enjoy your meal at your pace and will never rush you.  I really can't say enough about the customer service at Mr. Mamas.  Their commitment to their guest is as good as it gets. 

As for the food, I don't get too creative when I have breakfast. I'll usually stick to their eggs, bacon, toast, more eggs, and maybe a breakfast steak.  Every once in a while, I'll get their oatmeal or a short stack when my body craves it.  By the way, their hash browns extra crispy is dangerously good.  Bottom line, the food has always been awesome.  When the service is great, the food tends to taste even better.  Overall, I know what I'm going to get when it comes to Mr. Mamas and that's a good All-American breakfast with a side of excellent customer service. Thank You!

I don't know why I didn't try it sooner. Breakfast - chicken fried steak and eggs. VERY good. They make it themselves -- most other places use frozen chicken fried steak. Two of my favorites are Black Bear Diner and Peggy Sue's (I-15 just north of Barstow). This is right up there. Service is fantastic and friendly. My 2nd visit was for lunch. Had the tuna melt. There are three primary food items I judge a restaurant by - chicken fried steak; meatloaf; tuna melt. I was a disappointed in this one primarily because the tuna was very cool (almost cold in places). By definition, a tuna ""melt"" should be at least very warm, if not hot. I don't expect 'cool' tuna when I bite into a melt. The cheese wasn't as melted as it should have been. Granted, the tuna itself was excellent, but I didn't order a cold tuna sandwich. This is so basic that even I could make a decent acceptable one. IF it had been hot (or at least warm) I would likely have given 5 stars. It just barely makes 4 because, as picky as it might sound, I expect my tuna 'melt' to be hot enough to 'melt' the cheese.",0,0,0

To Black Bear, Egg Works, Omelet House, Hash House, Cracked Egg, and whoever else is out there: Bow down to your new king. Mr. Mamas runs this town now! Consistently TOP NOTCH breakfast and lunch. My personal favorite is the Greek Omelet; a beautifully cooked omelet stuffed with onions, spinach, garlic and Feta cheese. Everything goes together so perfectly, it's to die for. Literally, if I ever served some sort of sentence in Death Row for whatever reason and had to choose a last meal, the Greek Omelet is a very strong contender for the spot. They are just as good with everything else too. Pancakes are beautifully fluffy and tasty as hell. Burgers are thick and juicy. Bacons wonderfully crispy. So on and so forth. 

On top of all the wonderful food is even more wonderful people that work there. The owner (I think his name is Nick, yeah let's go with Nick), is quite possibly the friendliest person that's ever existed. No matter how busy the place is (It's ALWAYS busy by the way, so please be prepared for around a ten to fifteen minute wait. Don't be some passive-aggressive sourpuss like some people I saw the other day), he has an incredibly warm and friendly personality. He always makes it a point to greet every single person that comes in. He will always come by and check if everything is up to par (and it ALWAYS is, actually, screw ""up to par"" it's always a goddamn double birdie). He'll strike up candid conversation with anybody willing to have a conversation (He'll be sure to keep his distance if you look like you don't want to be bothered just as well, worry not introverted people!). His servers are just as great too, incredibly friendly and just RIGHT ON TOP OF IT when it comes to serving you. I only had to wait a couple minutes in a FREAKING PACKED HOUSE until my food arrived. I also don't think I held an empty glass for more than a minute. As soon as I finished my water or coffee, they'd have it refilled in an instant, while they're tending to a billion other people in the restaurant and just staying incredibly friendly on top of it. Nick, you better be paying these guys and girls great salaries, because they sure as hell deserve it!

The closest thing to a ""criticism"" I could give this place would be it's lack of the more specialized things. For instance, in terms of hot sauce, they only carry Cholula and Regular Tabasco I think. No Habanero of Jalapeño Tabasco if you're into that sort of thing. No obscure hot sauce that you could only buy in some small city if you're into that sort of thing. The same goes with coffee. No fancy-ass French Presses, Cappuccinos, Macchiatos, etc here. Just........coffee. I don't even think they have Hazelnut creamer. Their food while being super tasty, is also not all that exotic neither. Just your standard stuff that you could find at most similar establishments. Everything here is very ""basic"" in a way.........which is completely freaking fine with me! The QUALITY OF THEIR FOOD IS GODDAMN SPECTACULAR ON A REGULAR BASIS. Come on, my favorite basketball player of all time is Tim Duncan. He doesn't throw down jamtastic dunks or rainbow threes, he just grinds people down with pure fundamentals. I FREAKING LOVE PURE FUNDAMENTALS!!! Mr. Mama's is the Tim Duncan of the Breakfast Restaurant industry, which is obviously the best compliment in the world. It doesn't have any fancy-shmancy crap that make little difference (if any) in enjoying your restaurant experience. It just has WORLD CLASS food and customer service. If having all that means I miss out on ""Ass-Kickin Hot Sauce"" so be it.",0,0,0

Came in the day after Christmas with a party of 6. We had a wait of about 35 minutes but they were good about answering our questions of when we were next. We were packed in the small waiting area, but they have chairs and a small nice seating space - which can get cramped.

The food is delicious! Best pancakes I've had in a long time! I loved that they had smaller orders of the same great meals - the kids (10 and 13) got to get the same adult favorites but in their sizes without being called kids. :) 

My chicken fried steak was very yummy and I'd even order it again - super large portions! Family all loved their dishes and the hot chocolate and coffee were perfect. Pancakes are definitely sharable but you could finish them off yourself if you wanted to. 

And I love it how they do not pack more tables and chairs in the dining hall just to alleviate the waiting customers. Makes the dining experience more comfortable and roomy. I'm not cramped while eating or playing elbow hockey.

Cathy our server was phenomenal! She has our coffees filled and our order exactly right with the biggest smile and nicest personality. The youngest was even smitten with her and couldn't take his eyes off her. LOL! She was great!

Their pancakes are delicious and has a homey smell to it and their biscuits are nice and fluffy. Their gravy is homemade as well and you get little chunks of sausage and bacon in it.

This was my first venture here ever and it happened to be for my birthday brunch. My girlfriend chose it randomly and I'm glad she did, I mean a free cinnamon roll for birthday celebrators? Awesome! 

The cinnamon roll was ridiculous; the roll itself was insanely soft and melted in your mouth. The frosting was plentiful, but didn't overpower the cinnamon swirls. Truly a homemade dessert done right! 

My girlfriend and I shared breakfast; a California egg white omelets and a side of biscuits and gravy. The omelet was delicious, fluffy eggs and all the fixing's; Cheddar Jack Cheese, sausage, pico de gallo, sour cream, topped with avocado. This dish was huge and a perfect meal for sharing. 

The biscuits were, light, fluffy, and coated in a amazing white gravy. I would probably pour this gravy on pizza if I weren't afraid for my heart stopping shortly after. Ham, sausage, and maple syrup are the ingredients in the thick concoction and you definitely get every flavor in each bite, savory and salty. Amazing combo!

I came here on a Saturday morning and place was bustling with people which is a good sign. 

Service was impeccable. One of the guy (owner?) opened the door for us as we were walking towards the entrance with a warm greeting. Place was packed but they got more than enough servers to take care of everyone. A lady came by our table and introduced herself, I'm assuming she is also the owner? Her name was something along the line of Katherine or Kathy (why am I so bad with names...smh),  I can't remember but she was extremely friendly and welcoming. 

I was craving something sweet so I ordered their Mama's French Toast, which comes with 5 generous slices of toast with 3 eggs, and a choice of sausage\/ham\/bacon. French toast was dusted with powdered sugar but did not have any sweetness to itself. I put maple syrup to sweeten up the toast a little but quickly realized their maple syrup is not sweet at all.

Toasts were rather dry and the dish overall was forgettable. Bacon was crispy and eggs were cooked to my liking. 

In conclusion, I would give 3 stars for the food itself but based on their top-notch service, I am bumping it up to 4 stars. Thank you and will be back again!",7,4,7

The service is really 5 star! Really the best. The owner came out and talked with us. Super nice guy, he gave us a history of the restaurant, explained he wanted us to have a great time and to let him know if we needed anything. The food was prompt, coffees constantly filled. 

The food: 
1. Short stack of the best pancakes, large light and fluffy! So good! With eggs over easy, and fruit. Mine was great 5\/5
2. Eggs Benedict very heavy on the sauce, hash browns nothing to wow 4\/5
3. Breakfast wraps: their torilla game is lacking. Not very good, wouldn't recommend 
4. I think the chicken fried steak (I didn't try it) but my friend said it was ""exceptional.""

Inexplicably one of Las Vegas most heavily Yelped! Businesses, the only presumed reason being that low prices and big portions are a selling point for that particular demographic as the online deal offering $30 of food for a $15 pre-purchase expired long ago, it was with another adult plus a ten year old boy that the group checked in at the podium just past noon on a Saturday and waiting alongside four twenty-somethings who Uber'd from the Strip plus a couple passing through from Utah for nearly thirty minutes the scene was nothing short of controlled chaos, servers moving at a steady clip with a manager directing traffic while intermittently snapping pictures of another full house.

Eventually landing a table along the north wall of the restaurant, the current location not doing much to upgrade the décor but nearly tripling the number of seats with an equivalent increase in servers and kitchen size, it was by an identical menu from three years ago that diners were greeted, a few daily specials including Pancakes or French Toast slathered in canned Fruit Compote immediately passed over in favor of a two-plate and three sides order tallying just over $50 prior to tip.

Literally filled to capacity until their 2pm closing time, no waiting diners turned away but the Open\/Closed sign flipped over and no further seating allowed after the designated time, it was with a small glass of Milk and two Iced Coffees that the table waited another thirty minutes after seating for the whole order to be delivered at once, the house ""Iced Coffee"" similar to McDonald's in that it comes with Cream and Sugar already added while the Hot Brew poured over Ice is watered down and weak, though both are offered with endless refills for just three dollars.

Interestingly hiding prices on their website, an odd choice as most of the diner-staples ring in at a pricepoint similar to the big chains or other locally owned joints such as EggWorks or The Cracked Egg, it was with the table quickly flooded that pictures were taken and share plates were passed, the ""Mama's Stack"" putting sides of Sausage and Scrambled Eggs on a separate plate as the fluffy triple-stack overlapped its dish with Strawberries and Whipped Cream strewn on top, the addition of Pure Maple Syrup from home again showing the Pancakes to be rife with Buttermilk, not too dense and among the best in town.

Moving next to the Chicken Fried Steak, not a typical order but considered to be one of Mr. Mama's signatures and interesting enough in that regard to justify its $12.95 cost inclusive of three sunny-side Eggs, an unfortunately dry Biscuit and previously-frozen Homefries, suffice it to say there is nothing light about Sausage Gravy atop a pounded piece of deep fried Beef and although fans of the dish may say this is as good as it gets the fact of the matter is that it is certainly an acquired taste that did not go over well with 2\/3 of the table thanks to the thick and largely flavorless Country Gravy.

Mistakenly ordering an extra Biscuit, the addition of some honey definitely improving things to at least a point of edibility, those looking for something far better would do well to order one of Mr. Mama's famous $3.50 Cinnamon Rolls, the yeasty curl piping hot beneath thick frosting while a similarly priced side of Onion Rings is enough to go around the table several times with crisp batter and nary a hint of greasiness.  

**1\/2:  A pleasant enough place, though clearly one who has generated a following by way of low prices as opposed to quality cuisine, Mr. Mama's reminds one of the sort of diner food that spawns big crowds after church in a small Midwestern town where creativity is for lack and abundance matters most.

FYI: Those looking to use coupons would be well advised to expect a wait, math not exactly a strong suit for the staff and the middle-aged male cook with a pot-marked face who may or may not be the owner clearly a loud and greedy man who does not understand the idea of 'fine-print.'",7,2,4

One of the employees (I'm assuming an owner\/manager) opened the door for me and greeted me with a smile. I was seated immediately and asked by a host if I wanted a beverage. Our waitress came a few minutes later and introduced herself.

While I was waiting for my friend to arrive, our waitress would come by and ask if there was anything I wanted while I waited and I had any questions. I was already super impressed by the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff.

Once my friend arrived, our waitress explained the day's specials and gave us time to select our items. When we were ready to order, she was within waving distance. I got the egg, cheese, meat sandwich on their homemade biscuit, which was delicious. Definitely recommend the biscuit! I also got the potatoes, which were called home fried (or something similar). I prefer more seasoning on my potatoes, so I think I'll go for the hashbrowns next time. You have the option to get the potatoes fried or grilled, which is neat! My friend got the blueberry pancakes, which were amazing (I tried a bite). Light and super fluffy! I think I'll get them next time!!

My friend and I stayed and chatted well into the busy Saturday morning rush (the waiting area had begun to fill up when we left around 10:30am), but we never once felt pressure to leave due to the crowd. While I completely understand when a restaurant asks you to wrap things up due to a crowd; it's really nice to eat at a place where you can feel like you can take your time and chill with a friend.

What initially drew me in was the banner Postmates uses for Mr. Mamas. It is, of course, a photo of one of their out-of-this-world cinnamon rolls, dripping in white icing and already half-eaten. These sweet treats do not last long once they are within my, or any one of my various roommates', reach. 

I've also tried the French toast which was fabulous, as well as the bacon, country fried steak and eggs. No need for anything fancy, Mr. Mamas just knows how to do breakfast the way it's supposed to be.  

The other day, as I was placing a Postmates order for what I think was the second or third day in a row, I decided to use a little forethought and added a couple bowls of chili to stash until dinner time or whenever one of us realizes that there's food left unattended and unspoiled in the fridge, Ultimately I ended up reheating a bowl for a hungry friend.

Oh, and also, the food was delicious, way better than you should be getting at this price. My girlfriend had the biscuits and sausage gravy (also contains bacon and a hint of maple syrup, yum). I got the cali omelette. Both were generous portions and quite tasty.

After a late night in Vegas, the first thing you want in your system the next morning is a hearty meal that hits home for you. Mr. Mama's did just that for us. We walked in to a spacious room filled with a staff that greeted us with all smiles. A view of the partially open kitchen can be seen from our table and it wasn't long before our server took care of our orders, going far and beyond with her service all throughout our meal. Thank you, Abby! 

CHICKEN FRIED STEAK ($10.75) comes with 3 eggs your way, hash or home fries, and a side of carbs be it a sourdough toast or their fluffy pancake. I opted for the french toast for an extra $1.50 and it was money well spent. This meal alone can be shared between two people. Believe me when I say every part of this meal was fantastic! And that includes the hearty sausage gravy that topped the steak. Three of us ordered the same thing with different sides for variety and we were all impressed. Ideal sides for me would be two eggs sunny side up, one egg scrambled, hash browns, and their amazing pancake. Can I say, breakfast for champions?! 

CHILI (12oz bowl $5.75) to share between everyone on the table was surprisingly delicious. Though I prefer eating this with their sourdough toast than the packaged crackers it came with. More kick please!

CALI OMELETTE ($8.50) was another delightful entree packed with melted cheddar cheese and sausage, then finally topped with pico de gallo, sour cream, and fresh cut avocado for that extra creamy factor. This was another generous plate that came with your choice of two sides. Can't go wrong with this.

Impressed yet? Here's more. For an already reasonable breakfast, they have a Yelp offer for $15 off $30 worth of food and a check-in offer with 1 free beverage of your choice. Hello, fresh OJ! This deal is simply unbeatable. We may have lost some at the casino but we sure walked out of here a winner. They close at 2PM so come early!",40,34,35

The food portions are pretty big. 

I had the eggs Benedict with spinach, tomatoes &
ham. I made the mistake of ordering a single order of French Toast. Mistake being way too much food. 

The basic orders all come with a large share of hash browns. I mean the serving could easily serve 2 people. 

The food was very tasty, the hash browns can be ordered crispy. Which is what we had. The eggs on the eggs Benedict were perfectly cooked. Nice & runny on the yolk. The spinach and tomatoes were fresh. I easily filled up on the food.  Barely had room for the French Toast.  Now the French Toast had the right seasoning of cinnamon &
Powdered sugar   The bread was perfectly golden brown & fluffy.

Hubby ordered French toast.. Came with 3 eggs and bacon... The French toast was light and fluffy. Looks like a lot, but easily killed... Egg is standard... I was surprised by the bacon though... Thick cut, nice and crispy... But had no flavor! No saltiness or anything. That was a first! 

I ordered the chicken fried steak. And it was delicious! My meal came with a biscuit.. Everything was so heavy and dense, I skipped the biscuit (nice and buttered) and hash browns and just focused on the chicken fried steak and eggs. Again the eggs (over medium) is standard, with yummy runny yolk.. But the chicken fried steak was crunchy and flavorful.. Probably didn't even need any gravy! Yum! A generous portion too.

I don't remember where I got wind of this place but it was in my bookmarks and I suggested it the crew on our way out of Vegas.

It has a mom & pops feel but you can tell they pay extra attention to the small details.  A host opened the door for us as we walked in and immediately sat us down.  We ordered a cinnamon roll, a pair of chicken fried steaks, an omelette (I forget which), and a biscuits and gravy meal.

They started us off with the cinnamon roll which you could tell was definitely not store bought.  In my opinion, almost all cinnamon rolls out there are all icing and some bread.  This was was made with the correct amount of cinnamon and not completely drenched in icing.  It actually tasted like a pastry, not a dessert.

Their gravy is made with sausage, bacon, and a touch of maple syrup.  It was not runny in any way, shape or form; to the point where you could spoon it on with a fork.  By far the best breakfast gravy I've ever had.  The subtle sweetness of the gravy complemented and cut through the saltiness of the chicken fried steak.  It tones down the saltiness of the gravy itself making it that much more enjoyable.

The friend that got the omelette was surprised by the amount of veggies\/stuffing she had in it.  From the picture, you can see that veggies were coming out through the egg.  She said it was so satisfying that it wasn't just a few springs of spinach with 4 eggs.

Also note our ""extra crispy"" hashbrowns.  Whenever I order them that way elsewhere, they're always soggy in the middle.  Most establishments make your hashbrowns too thick so there's too much filler in between the crispy parts.  Not here.  The hashbrowns are spread thin enough to give you a big satisfying crunch instead of just mushy potatoes.

As we were driving out here, we were wondering where the hell we were going and if it was worth ever coming here again as it is a bit out of the way, but all of us agreed that it was and is definitely worth driving 15 minutes out of the way to visit this place on the way out of Vegas.  We plan on trying the lunch menu next time.

I brought friends from out of state here for their first taste of Vegas. It happened to be my first visit here also. We all were most impressed by this off the strip hidden jewel. This will be our go to place for breakfast in a peaceful atmosphere. Thanks for a job well done to the owner and staff here at Mr. Mamas.",0,0,1

I've forgotten just how delicious a deep-fried steak smothered in gravy can taste like when its on point. The thinly pounded steak was breaded perfectly and had the right amount of crisp. The thick gravy just put everything together, made my stomach happy.
I opted not to get the toast, instead I received one big pancake. 
I felt the price was reasonable considering the quality was outstanding and the portions was big.
  

The service is excellent, the staff are nice people and they took care of me.


I'll definitely be visiting Mr. Mamas again!!",2,1,3

I hopped off the plane looking for a good breakfast spot. The Yelp reviews averaged 4.5 stars so I gave it a try and Yelpers didn't steer me wrong.

Customer service was above par from the get go. As we were walking up to the door, the host (and I think manager) opened the door for us and gave us a warm greeting. He told us to sit wherever we wanted. It didn't take long for someone to come over with water and offer any check to see if we wanted any other drinks. We also didn't wait very long for our food to be served to us. 

In all honesty, the food wasn't spectacular. The pancakes, although they were generously sized, were kind of dry so I had to drench them in syrup. The eggs and everything else were standard but what I think made the experience so great was the fantastic customer service. Not bad Mr. Mamas, not bad.",19,16,20

It had green and red peppers, onions, scrambled eggs and potatoes.  Definitely my new favorite!  It reminds me of home fries from Rhode Island.

The first time I went it was a weekend and they were busy but there were plenty of wait staff. My husband had the country fried steak and it was good. My meal was forgettable (Greek omelette). 

The second time was a weekday morning and about more than half of the tables were full. I noticed something odd that I couldn't help but pay attention to. There were 8 tables full and 10 plus waiters. It was noticeably odd. Maybe they have a huge crowd come in at lunch and they were preparing for that. Then I thought maybe they have a training or meeting. Well I didn't see that happen either. What bothered me was this. I had a server named Melissa who was MIA our entire meal. We had to flag her down for water, for sugar free syrup, lemon, etc. we had to ask other people to get her because she was in conversations with other workers which did not appear to be work related talk. Upon noticing that I noticed every worker was in groups of 2 or 3 huddling around and talking not even looking at their tables. I could be judging here but honestly it didn't seem professional and I felt like a burden anytime I asked for anything. At one point our waitress rolled her eyes when we had to ask another waiter for the check and he said he would let her know. I'm not sure why she's annoyed when she's not doing her job. She was not the only one though. All I can think is that this kind of behavior is acceptable at this restaurant and chit chat between workers is acceptable as well. 

As for the food- my omelette was called a Spanish omelette and it had mozzarella cheese with spinach and Parmesan cheese with avocado on top. I'm not sure what part was Spanish about it. The hash browns I asked for extra crispy and it was soggy with extra crispy on the outside. Overall my meal was 3 stars but the service was 1 star.",9,4,3

For me...well I just came with my fiancé for Saturday brunch. It's definitely located in a plaza where you would easily miss it if you weren't using SIRI to find it (as I've driven past this place several times myself). When you get there, you're more than likely going to see people gathered outside & even sitting inside waiting for a seat in their restaurant. WORRY NOT. The wait may be 20-25 minutes...but you'll enjoy EVERY minute of whatever you order off that menu. 

Suffer now & enjoy your meal like a champion. Haha! 

We took a moment during the wait to sneak a peak at the menu and decide what we wanted...and this is what we came up with: 

1. Mama's Breakfast Burrito 
* skipped the meat...but added Pico De Gallo* 
THEY PUT IN AN ENTIRE AVOCADO IN THIS. I couldn't believe it -- that made this burrito 100% worth it & more. I usually don't eat burritos for breakfast, but I would damn sure well do it every day if it from this place. 

2. French Toast (2) 
So like, I don't know why I thought 1 order of French toast wouldn't be enough & decided to order 2. Well, I guess I overestimated...and then ate half of this item in a few minutes worth. #GobbleGobble The French toast has a little kick of cinnamon to it & you put syrup & run it through some of the powdered sugar on the plate -- and you've got yourselves a mighty good sweet tooth satisfied. 

3. Veggie Omelet 
Now this ones for the folks that can't go without eggs in the morning. Mr Mamas has a TON of options of what you can possibly do with eggs...so don't feel limited. Also, their house fries are bomb.com - so don't miss out on trying those. 

In terms of the service, it was EXCELLENT. We had people who called my fiancé by name to ask how the food was, asked to take pictures if we wanted to, and made sure our drinks were never left empty. They make customer service at other places look mediocre!

I was excited to try this place as it has some good reviews. I live 5 min away, and heard about it. 

We entered and waited 20 min to be seated. 
I asked the host how much longer will the wait be, and instead of him being polite, he said we should be patient and that we should wait more.
I asked him how many people are in front of us and he started getting irritated and angry.

The people I was with said the wait is too long. Some got there before me and waited even longer.

The host came back and instead of saying something nice became super rude and then he said they are not going to seat us and that they refuse us service. 

This is the worst restaurant experience I have had in Vegas and I've lived here for 10 years now.

Even if you're married to a guy who hates eggs, like I am.  The menu offers plenty of fresh breakfast options, the restaurant is flexible with customizing\/modifying ingredients to your liking, and it's not all breakfast.  If I were a local, I would be here weekly.  Sadly, since I am not, Mr. Mama's has become a MUST visit when we're in the area and a place to recommend to friends.

SERVICE
+The staff is friendly-super chill. On a four day trip, we ate here twice.  On our second visit the hostess remembered us- little things go a long way.  
+Table service- very attentive without being overbearing.  Your coffee cup will not go unfilled, they have a specific person who only does drinks, used plates are immediately removed.  For a casual unassuming place, the quality of service was a pleasant surprise.  

FOOD
+AMAZING  This is definitely my favorite breakfast spot in the US.  Their website boasts how they ""put a smile on your face""-- they do.  You'll want to work your way through the menu.  

2 Eggs and Toast $4.50  (5 STARS)
+Eggs cooked to your preference, select from 5 different types of toast (sourdough for me), fresh home fries are also included (add peppers and\/or jalapenos for my fellow spice lovers)  

Pancakes  (5 STARS)
+Order a single, short stacks (2), stacks (3), pancakes (2)  Buttery, fluffy, light, warm, delectable, perfection

Cinnamon Roll  (4.5 STARS)
+It does not disappoint.  Cinnamon rolls are freshly made, served on the small plate, airy, light... My husband LOVED it.  He particularly appreciated how the cinnamon roll wasn't too dense. 

French Toast (5 STARS)
+Choose from a plethora of options-1, 2, 3 with bacon, sausage, ham, etc.  

I want to try the:
+Breakfast burritos
+Omelets (they're huge-fit the plate) served with sides
+I'm eying the BLT and Mamas Sandwich (Turkey, Bacon, Avocado, Pepperjack cheese- select your bread)

What I wish:
+That they had fresh juices... just a thought! ;o)

My grandfather is handicapped and walks super slow but they made sure that he didn't have to rush which was nice. The owner mentioned he had several surgeries so he understands the struggle. 

We ordered a variety of dishes to show my grandma what American breakfast is like and I think she really enjoyed it! We ordered a mr MaMa breakfast 3 pancakes, 3 eggs with sausages, veggie omelette, breakfast burrito, chicken fried steak, egg benedict, and Mr MaMa burger for 7 people. 

My grandma enjoyed the Egg Benedict and was hogging it even tho we were suppose to be sharing. I enjoyed the egg veggie egg omelette because I wanted something lighter and it was perfect. The pancakes were fluffy and delicious. My brother enjoyed their breakfast burrito and burgers and my dad enjoyed the chicken fried steak. 

Service was great in general, they did their best to make us comfortable and feel welcomed. The coffee was constantly refilled and waiters were very tentative.

Bowl of chili - They ask if you want cheese and onions added on top for an additional charge of 35cents each. not particularly a fan of places that charge extra for toppings when it should probably just come with it. Nothing special to the chili to rave about.

Chicken fried steak with their house gravy made with sausage, bacon, and maple syrup. The gravy itself was bland. I'm not sure if it was just a bad day or just how it is suppose to be because I expected more flavor out of it. The steak however was very good. Better than most breakfast joints. Such a shame that the gravy came up short.

Home fries - crispy potatoes squares topped with peppers and onions. Again the toppings cost extra. Otherwise the potatoes would have probably been too plain.

Biscuits and gravy. Half order comes with one biscuit cut in half. Topped with the same gravy. The biscuit itself was very fluffy.

The staff was very friendly made us feel welcome & personable from the moment we walked in until the very end when we left. They all worked together helping each other out. A+.
The server was very helpful she introduced the daily specials plus the popular items. The menu has quite the variety to choose from.
Started off with a Cinnamon Roll that we all shared. That was good! A nice starter. 
I ordered the Mamas Chicken Fried Steak with that O so Yummy Country Gravy, over hard eggs & home fries with sourdough toast! I enjoyed my meal very much. Didn't want it to end. 
My friends ordered Mamas stack (bacon & eggs), homemade pancakes, Mamas Burger with onion rings & Greek Omelette. They all enjoyed their meals & were very happy.

I will soon be back. Definitely a must try. They get pretty busy but it's surely worth the wait.",0,0,0

Immediately after we walked in to the restaurant we were greeted by a very happy and welcoming gentlemen who walked us to our table. He was genuinely happy and made us feel extremely welcomed and special. In a restaurant that was almost completely full he did seem rushed or frazzled which was a pleasant feeling. He introduced us to our waitress and the service was amazing from start to finish.

Food was like any other breakfast place. Nothing special or spectacular about the menu. I'm not very picky about coffee but I do like having the option of having flavored creamers (like how many other breakfast places have) and this restaurant does not offer flavored creamers. I prefer eggworks or Baby Stacks, but have to commend this place for its amazing customer service.",6,2,4

I had chicken fried steak- bigger than my face too - with some of the best sausage gravy I have ever tasted! And that's saying a lot because my parents are from the South and I've had my share of gravy.

The food was great but so was the service! From the time we walked in the door to the steps we took leaving, the hostess and wait staff was very attentive to our every need. My husband's coffee cup was never empty, my soda was strong and always topped off.

We were accommodated regularly since we had a bigger party of 14 people, it's not far from the airport and it's located in a plaza so it also has good parking. 

Food: 4\/5 I got the chicken fried steak and it was soooooooo good! They have homemade gravy and it was one of the best ones I've had yet, I got a side of eggs and they were well done as well as their potatoes. If you get their potatoes stick to their cube potatoes, they had a crunch yet they were soft in the inside. Only reason I'm giving this a four is because my boyfriend got the steak with eggs & the steak was not good. It came out looking thin & was chewy. If you come here stay to the more popular options (chicken fried steak, eggs Benedict) I also have to compliment them on their pancake, it is huge! And their toast was the perfect amount of buttery. They do serve huge portions so I would also recommend sharing if you both don't have a big appetite. 

Staff\/Customer Service: They are definitely open, honest & genuine. Since we had a big party they let us know if it was okay to serve the two couples that got there before us. They wanted us to feel appreciated and I have to applaud to that. Many restaurants lack communication and at mr.mamas they treat you like family.",0,0,0

The best parts of the meal were the coffee and pancakes, the rest was very lackluster. I ordered less cooked bacon and received hard-as-a-rock bacon that was noticeably overcooked. The butter they gave me for the grits was fake butter (margarine made of vegetable oil). The eggs were ordered over medium but came out quite undercooked. The service was excellent, however.

When I arrived and walked in I was most aggressively greeted and asked all kinds of questions. It was quite the barrage: a table for one? Are you getting take out? Are you waiting for someone? I was just making sure so we can help you... All that before: hello how are you? (Which never happened) 

I was waiting for a friend before seating, so I just walked outside to wait. It would have been better to be asked: dine in or take out? How many in your party and would you like to wait? 

My friend arrived. We were sat right away by someone else. We were able to get drinks right away. We got the special of strawberry pancakes, drink and eggs for $9 plus we got a side of hash browns. All good at this point. 

Then things started going... Not well. We had a hair in the coffee cup, my eggs came in wrong (ordered over medium got scrambled) and when the runner\/ server came back to give me the new eggs she handed me the plate instead of helping me to find a place on our crowded table to set it down. 

The strawberry pancakes had thinly sliced strawberries, about 4-5 slices on each large pancake. Not even a full strawberry on each plate. Maybe one strawberry for both our orders put together. And there were 4 pancakes. We asked for more and they brought them. No big deal. Seems like it should have come with more than 1\/2 strawberry each order.

We came in for a late breakfast and we waited about 10 minutes.  The menu has a great variety and something for everyone.  My boyfriend got the country fried steak and I got the eggs with bacon and hashbrowns. 

The food was great and the coffee kept coming (my fave!), even though I wasn't obsessed with the taste of it.  Our server was SO kind.  I would hire her in a heartbeat.  She would overhear our conversation and chime in, which some people may think is annoying, but I just thought she was so sweet and caring!  She made the most motivational comments and was just an uplifting positive person.  The owner\/manager?  talked to us a few times and was very friendly.  He asked if we would like a photo which was thoughtful even though we declined.

Immediately upon arrival, my family was warmly greeted and tended to by the friendly staff.  They brought a special chair that our baby's carrier\/carseat could fit into more safely than their regular chairs (that's going above and beyond good service).  Throughout the course of the meal, the staff came by to say hello and check on all their customers.  They were warm, funny, sincere.  An awesome mom & pop breakfast stop.

We used the $15 for $30 Yelp deal and it was more than enough food for my wife and I and my 3yr old.   We ordered and our breakfast came out so fast even with how busy the place was.  Nice.

I had the country fried steak and with poached eggs and hash browns.   Everything tasted great and the portion was huge.  I brought it home and it was still good later on.  The gravy they use was different, with pieces of bacon and sausage I believe mixed in.  It was good.

My wife had the Mr. Mama's french toast.  Ordered it scrambled eggs and a nice portion of ham.  The french toast came with 4 pieces powdered with sugar.

We also ordered a short stack and honestly, that was ALOT for us.  2 huge plate sized pancakes.   We wished there was an option to get our pancakes topped with either fruit or chocolate.  My daughter loves her strawberry-topped pancakes.

Finally, I also had extra from the Yelp deal, so I ordered their beef soup of the day.  There's soups with beef and then there's' Mr. Mama's beef soup.  HUGE chunks of beef.  Good broth.  

4 stars for the food and 1 more star for the GREAT service they provided.  Definitely recommending their breakfast and definitely use this awesome Yelp deal!",10,2,6

Six of us arrived for breakfast at 10am, and the place was still about 80% full... good sign! The door was opened, and we were welcomed with a smile by Mr. Mama himself. There is no pretentiousness about this place. It is just one large room with tables and chairs, no booths. The server was on us instantly, asking for our coffee, juice and water order, with no pressure for the breakfast order... Nice! I ordered 2 pancakes and a side of sausage patties, both were perfect. The pancakes are fluffy, and nearly the size of the plate, (glad I didn't order a ""stack"" which is 3 pancakes). A stack with a side would be enough to feed an adult and two children. The rest of our group had similarly sized portions of eggs, potatoes, etc. One of our group had the home made corned beef hash, one of the best ever! The server was attentive, constantly checking coffee refills and making sure we were otherwise satisfied. Mr. Mama showed a genuine interest in our satisfaction, thanked us, and asked us to return.",0,0,0

I have been here twice and both times I saw the owner working and talking to customers. He always said thank you to customers for coming in and that he will see them next time. You don't get that kind of friendliness from owners now a days! 

PANCAKES!!! The pancakes here are huge. A stack of 3 is big enough to share among 2 or 3 people if everyone gets something else but still wants a taste. The pancakes are fluffy and never burnt or chewy. 

The first time I came here, the service I received was amazing. My coffee cup was always refilled and the girl working was friendly and always smiling. She checked up on us quiet often. My bf ordered the steak and eggs and the steak was very very thin. It was filling, but he mentioned that he wouldn't order steak and eggs from here again as there are other better and cheaper options on the strip. I ordered one pancake to share between the 2 of us, hash browns, 2 eggs, wheat toast and sausage. The sausage here are sausage patties so don't expect the regular sausage links. I prefer links so I didn't order the sausage the second time around. 

If you like hash browns... you MUST order it here! They are SUPER crispy. They list potatoes on the menu but potatoes = hash browns here, unlike other places where potatoes mean fried potato chunks. 

My sister ordered the chicken fried steak which came with 3 eggs, gravy, choice of toast and hash browns. It was huge. When we ordered this, our server asked us if we tried their gravy before and proceeded to list off a bunch of ingredients. Definitely not your traditional gravy. It was quite thick and very chunky.

I have no idea where I got that notion from. Nothing could have been further from the truth. This place is a sit-in all-American sort of breakfast place and reminds me a lot of Eggworks on a smaller scale. That does not mean their food is any less delicious, though! 

My friend and I walked in at around 1 PM on a Sunday, and there were two or three couples ahead of us. The host told us there'd be a 15-minute wait time, but got us to our table after barely five minutes had passed. Under-promise, over-deliver, right? 
I got Mama's Breakfast Burrito with ham and the chunky salsa sauce, and it was great. It was admittedly a bit on the smaller side, but the ingredients and ham in it were so filling that I was full by the time I finished it.

It's located in a small shopping center. We got a parking stall right up front. As we approached the door, a friendly guy opened the door for us. He worked there and greeted us hello. 

We got seated at a table. The kind waitress took our drink orders. I got an iced tea. I was debating on either getting breakfast or lunch. I wanted a burger, so I got the Mama's burger which is 1 pound of meat. It consisted of mushrooms, avocado, lettuce, tomato, bacon, red onions and I went with cheddar cheese. You get a choice of a type of cheese. I got French fries with my burger. It also came with a slice of dill pickle. I had to eat my burger with a knife and fork because it was too big to take a bite. Burger was juicy. Cheddar cheese was melted. Mushrooms were perfect. The bun was even buttered and toasted to perfection. One of the best burgers I have had in Vegas! The fries were cooked well. I truly enjoyed my burger. I had to give almost half of it to hubby. 

Service was great! Waitress asked if I needed a refill on my iced tea. I was fine. I thought the waitress was a little forgetful because she gave my burger to my hubby. I had to tell her the burger was mine. She also thought my hubby had an iced tea when he ordered a Pepsi. I understand if she got busy tending to other customers. A waitress who waits on you should remember what you ordered. That's considered excellent skills! I had to dock a star for that.

I LOVE breakfast foods. No, really... I truly LOVE breakfast foods soo much. Omelettes, eggs, french toast, sausage, and on and on and on..so I had this place bookmarked for a while.

We walked in this morning and were instantly greeted with a ""Happy 4th of July"" greeting from Mr Mama himself! Wow! Ok..that was cool! The place was busy but we were still seated right away and our friendly waitress went over the specials of the day. There were so many items I wanted to try from the get go, but I decided on a classic fave of mine - steak and eggs! My friend got the same thing, so than we decided to split an order of french toast just to try something else out.

Service here is incredible! The waitress and owner were so friendly and personable! They were attentive without being intrusive. The service here was simply sheer perfection on this day!

...and the food! Wow! Everything was cooked so fresh and tasted fantastic! I prefer my steaks medium rare and often time run into places that will overcook it. Not Mr Mama's! This steak was cooked to perfection and was seasoned beautifully! Even the hash browns were cooked just right! So frickin' tasty!

It is a 100% guarantee that I will be back here, and quite often, to try different menu items! The prices here are very fair and reasonable, but the food, and especially the service, are incredible! 

Woohoo! As good as it gets!

We were on a road trip from California and Vegas was our first stop. We came right when the place opened, which was awesome since I hear Mr. Mamas can be packed during the weekend. First thing you'll notice right away is the service. Everyone from the restaurant was so unbelievably friendly, happy and accommodating that it had to make me wonder -- how are all these people so happy about life? Why are all these people so damn friendly? On my reviews, I tend to focus more on the food than anything else, but their service is on a whole other level. 

... Especially Mr. Mama. Oh yes -- he is real. You'll know who he is right away. You can really tell how much he cares about his customers just by the way he talks. 

Food-wise, I really can't complain. Their food is amazing, and the prices very affordable. Amazing, but nothing extremely mind-blowing, maybe except for the Mama's Chicken Fried Steak though. That stuff is bonkers. It was so delicious, and even had a slight crisp inside which I was not expecting at all. I would say if you were to get anything from here, it would be Mamas Chicken Fried Steak for sure.

We were pleased to see plenty of parking and a spacious restaurant. Most of the tables were filled, but we were able to snag a seat without any wait. The menu is to the point with some very intriguing and traditional selections. The menu does appear to be Greek inspired which I thought was a fun twist on a breakfast joint.

The coffee was consistently refilled and the service was spot on. The owner was out and about mingling and chatting with the patrons. 

I opted for the Jenna Wrap while my husband went with a more traditional chicken fried steak and hash browns. We also had a side of gyro meat. My wrap consisted of over hard egg, avocado, cilantro, jalapeno, salsa, sour cream,
& cheddar cheese. It was a perfect, light blend of ingredients to get my morning started.  The chicken fried steak was perfectly prepared and the gravy wasn't too overwhelming. It was the perfect balance of unhealthy but delicious goodness. The gyro meat was also a hit.

Shawn was really informative as to what he recommend us to order and other eateries to visit throughout the day. I'm so happy we ate here and have so many good things to write about this place that I'd run out of time and space to write, so my final words are ""you won't go wrong here if you  follow your taste buds",0,0,0

There were so many options and everything sounded so delicious. It didn't help that all the customers around us also had yummy smelling food. I would recommend to review the menu before you visit so you have a better grasp on what you want when you're there.

The staff was very attentive without being intrusive.  I hate it when the waitstaff hovers over u. The staff was there whenever I needed them but they did not intrude on my time with my friend.  So it was good to be able to talk without being constantly interrupted.  :)

Now onto the food. I was hungry so I ordered a little bit of everything.  Lol

Grits were delicious!  Totally made this southern girls day!  Creamy with just the right amount of salt to season it.  They offered me extra butter for it and come on butter makes everything better!  Lol

Biscuits and gravy...seriously one of the best I've had it was soooo good....just thinking about it makes me want to eat it again. I'm drooling just thinking about it. ;)

Corned beef and hash...I love love corned beef....lol I got the hashbrowns extra crispy based off the the reviews that I read on yelp and they did not disappoint.  It was crispy on the outside and creamy in the middle.  Yummilicious! The eggs were perfectly cooked and the corned beef was delicious.  They left it on the griddle long enough for the corned beef to build texture so it was melt in your mouth in the middle mixed with crunchy from the bits from the edges that were perfectly browned on the edges.

This place is about 3 miles off strip but easy to find and lots of convenient parking. We arrived at 7:30 am on a Saturday morning and the OWNER opened the door for us and greeted us. Ample, standard dinner seating and before long we had coffee, had examined the menu, and were ordering. The waitress said the Cali Omelet was their most popular item so I gave it a try. 

Our coffee cups never went empty while we waited for food. My Cali Omelet was perfectly prepared and yummy - better than I expected. My daughter had the Denver Omelet and was equally pleased. The only part of the food not ""good as it gets"" was the toast - I've had better at Reno places that get their bread from Truckee bakery. 

While we were their the cook brought out samples of the daily specials for the staff to examine and take pictures of. We could hear him describing his dishes to the owner and staff and he took great pride in his food. 

We were asked several times how we were doing, including by the owner. I told him I found him on Yelp! where he was rated #2 and complimented him on his operation. He told me that while he appreciates the high rating he knows ratings are fleeting and he tries to operate everyday as if they were still trying to get to the top.

Below I s my original review. Prices have gone up slightly. The Chicken Fried steak was $1.25 more then in 2013. My omelet was the same.

Service was great. My coffee always full.

My former review below.Again from November 2013. 

I LOVE BREAKFAST!

Because of that I am not easily impressed, and I don't just hand out five stars.
It has to be earned.

With our Las Vegas trip planned  for the PBR Finals, I had already Yelped and decided what places we were going to try on out trip.

Mr. Mamas was at the top of my list.

We got to Mr. Mamas and were immediately seated.  
The staff was so friendly.
Our server was on the spot, my coffee cup never got below half way.

I had a Cheese Omelette (Pepperjack) and added tomatoes.
Hubby had the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs.
and he also ordered some French Toast.  Everything was DEEEEEELICIOUS!
The portions were generous.

Last but not least talk about REASONABLE PRICE!!! Our breakfast was only $20.00

We had a lovely chat with the owner about his and his families history in the food business.   I loved the old photo they have of one of their restaurants in Detroit from long ago, complete with the mob guy in it coming for his weekly protection money.

The next time I am going to Las Vegas I am going to be more excited about my trip to Mr. Mamas then my trip to the rest of the town.

Great Breakfast and a wonderful owner and staff.   I so look forward to eating there again.

We decided to try Mr. Mama's not only based on their recommendation but also the many positive Yelp reviews. 

I hade the breakfast burrito, husband had the corn beef and hash with a side salad, daughter #1 had a BLTA with chicken noodle soup, and daughter #2 had an a la carte pancake. All of us thought the food was good. Daughter #1 raved about the chicken noodle soup. The side salad that my husband had was huge, a generous portion for sure. The pancakes are also really big and perfectly cooked, but one was plenty for the eight year old. 

The owner is incredibly personable and was the person taking names up front when we got there. He quoted a wait of about 30 minutes and we waited about 25 - decent as the place was pretty packed for a Friday at 11:00 am. He was chatting with everyone and you can tell he loves his customers. He really was all over the place overseeing everything and I think his involvement makes a difference in the success of the place. The service was great and the employees seemed to love their jobs - yet another difference maker.

One really lovely perk is that they offer you a to-go cup and that's awesome as we have an eight hour drive ahead of us so having an ice cold drink was just a nice offer. 

Our entire meal was just over $44.00. After paying $75 (average) for meals on the strip that were subpar in most cases, this was a great deal.",0,0,0

now, moving on to the food... dun dun dunnnnnnn... 

- i had a cheeseburger and fries, which was good... not great, not horrible, just some where in the middle (comparable to a dennys burger, perhaps?)  

- my hubby had the eggs benedict w\/ sausage and a side of corned beef hash... which he totally should NOT have - the hollandaise sauce was super bland, it had no flavor at all... (and i even tasted it to make sure he wasnt being super picky).  the corned beef hash seemed like was out of a can (and not a good brand either) the potatoes were ground up w\/the cornbeef and it was just 'meh' 

on a good note:
- our son had the biscuits and gravy, which is his all time FAVE and everyplace he eats them he rates them on a scale from 1 to nana's (w\/ nana's being the best of course) and he said they were right up there w\/nana's!

in conclusion... if we do go back, we will all order the biscuits n gravy ;)",2,2,2

I was ecstatic when they moved to this location for it is about twice the size and the parking is more than plentiful. If there was a candidate for 6 stars this would be the place! Because if the old location is as good as it gets then this new location just made it even better!

Now as we made our way in the first time one sunday morning, there were people waiting to be seated. I asked what the wait time was and they said about 10 minutes. THEY LIED! But in a good way. After about 5 minutes we were seated with menus in hand. 

I was kind of afraid that with the bigger size of the place that the great service that we have come to expect might have gone downhill a bit. Im happy to report that they are chugging right along! Service was spectacular! Like they never left the old location! What I love about the service is that they always seem to have plenty of servers running around. Not only do you have your main server, but other servers help out as well whether its picking up your empty plates, refills, or bringing out your order as soon as its done.

As for the food, if you refer to my last review it is still the same. These guys are mainly a breakfast place but you do have other options as well like burgers, sandwiches, wraps, subs, salads, etc. If you are really hungry I have to mention the Mama's Burger ($11.95). Two half pound beef patties, cheese, bacon, mushrooms, avocado and an onion ring. I thought I was really hungry when I ordered this but I was so wrong. It's basically like eating two burgers. Might as well cut it in half and share!

For you omelet lovers, I highly recommend getting the Cali Omelet ($8.50). It has cheddar jack cheese, sausage, pico de gallo, sour cream, and then topped with avocado. We always have them add bacon to it because bacon makes anything better. This meal comes complete with your choice of home fries or hash browns. I usually get hash browns for they cook it so crispy. You also get your choice of toast from sourdough, white, or wheat. I always get sourdough and they automatically butter it for you.

Some useful info. They used to have a 15 for 30 dollar Yelp deal but I did not see it last time we went but if it comes back you definitely want to take full advantage of it. What took its place is a free beverage with the purchase of an entree with check in. Their business hours are Monday thru Friday 6 am to 3 pm. Saturday and Sunday 7 am to 2 pm. 

In closing, the drive is worth the trip here and you are not too far away from the strip. It's definitely a nice change of pace from those marked up so called fancy places.

The interior is rather simple, I rather liked the pictures from the 30's and 40's scattered around the room. They do keep their place clean making sure the next person sitting at the table isn't stepping on or leaning on leftover food.

The food: Ordered the Greek burrito which was surprisingly excellent for a diner, a definite must try when in the mood for a burrito. The pancakes here are rather good, very fluffy unlike those that taste like cake. We also tried the french toast which was ok, nothing really special about them, if I had to pick I would stick to the pancakes for your sweet tooth. Portion sizes are ok, nothing over the top, what you order is what you get. The staff here is super friendly and happy to help making sure everything was ok and our water cups filled.

As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by several staff which was a nice welcome. We came around 12pm on a Monday and it was packed but they were able to quickly get us a table. 

Literally, as soon as we sat down, a server asked for our drink order. Talk about fast service! Then, shortly after looking through the menu, another server came and took our order. It didn't take long for our food to be delivered  and the presentation was on point! 

I ordered the steak and eggs. I chose the potatoes over the hash browns and I had the option of adding peppers and onions. My steak was cooked perfectly well done with beautiful grill marks, eggs over easy and the potatoes were crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. Just absolutely tasty! The quality, taste and presentation was just perfection. 

Now, let's talk about the service. While we were waiting for our food, I observed a lot of the workers really engaging with every table. We were approached multiple times by multiple staff tending to our needs which made me feel like they really wanted to make sure we were taken care of. We were even asked if we wanted a photo which I thought was a nice gesture. They really live up to their slogan, ""Where you feel at home."" 

Overall, the staff were very sincere with their interaction with everyone and very attentive to our needs. Most importantly,  excellent quality of food. I highly recommend this place!",3,1,1

This feels like a mom and pop place because the people here treat you like it's family breakfast. They seat quickly and the waitress we got topped our drinks without having to be asked.

The great service really is a huge part of the culture here and it shows in every aspect. 
The food was delicious as well. My mom and I split the biscuits and sausage gravy with hash browns. The gravy was so good and I usually don't care for it. My only advice would be to get the hash browns well done if you like them crispy.

The owner Nick will open the door and greet you when you walk up to the restaurant. Then he will get you seated right away ... and if the place is busy he will let you know how long your wait will be, offer you a chair, and be extra attentive to you. While he is doing this, he is aware of everything that is going on in his restaurant, from the guests' needs to the activities of his staff.  This place is full of good energy!

Claudia was our great waitress. She served us water and coffee, then took our orders, and came back with our hot food not too long after. She, the other staff members, the owner, and even the hostess made their rounds through out the restaurant and stopped by our table often enough to clear empty plates and to make sure that our water glasses and coffee cups were never empty. 

We didn't order anything extraordinary but what we did order was excellent:

Pancakes: really really good. 
Ham steak: perfect portion perfectly cooked. 
Hash browns: golden crispy. 
Biscuit gravy: very good. Gravy had bits of sausage and bacon in it. 
Wedge salad: they added sliced onions, tomatoes, and cucumbers to it. This added to the presentation. I loved it, but husband would ask for those on the side next time. 
Home fries: truly the best!
Bacon: perfectly not overly cooked crispy. 
Cinnamon rolls: daughter got a free one for her birthday. I am not big on sweets, but this is really really good. 
Coffee: good
Eggs: expectedly prepared as ordered. 

I asked for a side order of fresh jalapeños for my sunny side up eggs and they came out nicely diced. 

I liked this restaurant the moment I walked in. It is spacious and clean and generates good energy. All the staff is aware of all the going-ons in the restaurant, as well as being super politely friendly. I will definitely come here again the next time I come to to Vegas.

We also ordered one pancake which was  also huge to share at the end of our omelet. I didn't get to eat my half of pancake because I was so full.  I swear it's something they do with the eggs.

Tired of the overpriced, crowded, and often underwhelming Vegas food options on The Strip (near the Flamingo), we sought out something different. After only one google search we chose Mr. Mamas based on its high reviews and we could not have made a better choice.

After a 25 minute Uber ride in traffic we arrived at Mr. Mamas and were sat immediately (however we did hear that they get quite busy so I guess Monday at 1pm was our lucky time). We both ordered the Chicken Fired Steak and Eggs. Everything was amazing and for about $10 per meal the $15 Uber ride basically paid for itself...since our other options were expensive buffets or pricey breakfast locations with insane waiting times. The gravy is even made in house! Delicious.

The staff were some of the nicest people we met the entire time. Multiple people greeted us, asked how our meal was, and had great conversation and service.

We had an omelette and pancake stack.  The omelette is large (4 eggs) and was delicious, I highly recommend. The pancakes are home made and gigantic. No joke, the full stack of 3 pancakes was over 2 inch's thick and larger then the plate. My son is 17 and always finishes his meal, he could not finish.  Must order.

The wrap came with a side of house made salsa.

The wrap was quite good and came tightly wrapped in a flour tortilla. The scrambled eggs were very good, but the bacon was not only plentiful, but had a great texture and flavor. I enjoyed it very much and it was present in every bite, the way it should be. The avocado was just ripe and creamy, the tomatoes added a nice acidity, and the garlic flavor was very mild. Oh yes, it would of been nice if it had more cheese because I would of liked to have seen it oozing out. 

The side of salsa was great. It did not provide much heat, but what it lacked in heat, it made up in flavor. It was zesty, with a garlic flavor, and spot on seasoning. Pouring into the wrap as I ate it, was the ticket. Good stuff...

Browsing thru my bookmarked places, Mr. Mamas got the majority's vote to try for my daughters birthday breakfast. We arrived around 9 am on a Monday, I was dreading the anticipated long line as I've heard and read rave reviews about this place. Luckily, there was only a few people ahead of us and we only had to wait a couple of minutes.

As far as the menu, it was pretty straight forward and not extensive. I didn't see any waffles, crepes or eggs benedict. 

I give the food 3 stars and an extra one for good service. Our waitress Crystal was helpful and she constantly checked on us, though she seemed distracted at times. We mentioned it was our first time and asked for popular dishes ordered. She suggested the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs with sausage gravy which she asked if I wanted to try first in case it wasn't to my liking, I thought that was very nice of her so I wouldn't be stuck with something I didn't like. She also brought us a complementary Cinnamon roll for the birthday girl to try. They didn't have any specialty pancakes but she said they can put chocolate chips if we wanted. She asked if I wanted onions and peppers with my home fries and I said sure, but what she failed to mention was that all those add ins (chocolate chips, onions and peppers) were add on charges as well. It wasn't a big deal for us when I saw the bill but I could see potential issues arise. Also ordered by our party was the Corned beef hash, Western Omelet, and Buttermilk pancakes with bacon and eggs. I can't say the food was extraordinary after all it's breakfast fare and it's kind of hard to screw that up. Though I will say the pancakes were fluffy and the bacon thick, extra crispy and delicious.

Their hospitality more than anything is what makes them popular with tourists and locals alike. Looking forward to a follow up visit to try their other offerings.

However, I'm not a breakfast type of person. I eat breakfast foods now and then but I'm not totally crazy about it like some are. I do appreciate a good omelet though.  

My boyfriend and I decided to go on a Sunday for lunch about an hour before they closed. When we got there, the whole place was packed but luckily, people were getting ready to leave. And we weren't the only ones that were coming in too. There was a couple before us and a couple of people after us as well. This just goes to show that Mr Mamas consistently has customers through the day. 

My boyfriend and I decided to share the Spanish Omelet with ham, 1 slice of French Toast, and a greek yogurt parfait. 

When our Spanish omelet came, I was a little confused. I could've sworn that I ordered it with ham but instead of ham, there was bacon. Granted, it was close to closing time so there might have been a mistake here or there with the kitchen rushing the orders out. I didn't say anything bout the mishap only because I didn't want to wait for it to be redone so we stuck it through. I mean, I guess bacon is sort of like ham...they're both pork. *Shrugs.* There were also hash browns that came with the omelet and we had specifically requested well done hash browns. I like my hash browns crispy on the outside and warm goodness on the inside. The hash browns did not look as well done as the pictures we've seen but it was still good nonetheless. It was probably some of the best hash browns I've had in Vegas. 

I love how Mr Mamas allows you to order pancakes and French toast by the slices. I don't like pancakes but if my friend or boyfriend does, they can order just a slice or two since I won't help them eat it. As for French toast, I like them but I don't like them enough to gobble a whole order. I haven't had French toast in ages and I've almost forgotten what they taste like. French toast holds a comforting place in my heart -- I used to make them with my uncle when I was a young girl. Unfortunately, Mr Mamas does run short for their French toast. It doesn't quite bring about the comfort feelings but it is still good -- just not something I would order again. It seemed a little plain to me. I might enjoy it more if it had options for whip cream and strawberries. 

Their greek yogurt parfait was beautiful and possibly my favorite order of the day. It was loaded with mixed berries and granola. It was the perfect healthy breakfast -- can't really go wrong with that! 

Overall, Mr Mamas, to me, was good but not the best. Perhaps I walked in with super high expectations and with that, it's hard to satisfy me. Nothing here gave me a huge surprise and nothing made me crave for more. One of the bonus things about Mr Mamas is that it is not pricey .. definitely great to dine with a family! :)",2,5,3

Outside - fairly new building. Check out my photo from the parking lot.  

Sign-in - the  Dude (I forget his name), said about a 45 minute wait.  I thought - well,  if Yelpers say it's 4.5 stars,  it's got to be worth the wait.  So wait we shall.

25 minutes later, my party already had our table.  Yay!

Atmosphere - I love the checkerboard floors that make it seem like you're in a diner, but with a truly open floor plan.  You see everyone.  There's no hiding inside Mr. Mama's, so anyone fooling around in Vegas will probably avoid this place.  Hahaha, and that's one of the reasons I love it.  Even with all the noise, it's all good.  It's exciting seeing what everyone else got, too.  Makes you more hungry. 

Food - OMG!  I got the Mama's Stack which comes with 3 pancakes.  Everything on that plate was awesome.  My tween son had the Spanish omelette. I didn't try it, but what I did try was the french fries on his plate.  They're so cute cubed up that all that time i thought they were hash browns. And they tasted sooo good.. 

Service - very impressed.  Even though it was a packed house,  food came in out in 15 minutes tops. And not just us, seems everyone else too.  Our server, gal that looks like Selena Gomez, was very friendly and attentive.  She checked on us every 5 minutes.  Kat, the  manager, circled around checking on everyone.  Seriously, I don't think I've ever gotten that kind of attention from a breakfast joint anywhere.  

My only complaint, which I shared with Kat - was the fact that they have only 2 restroom stalls, a men and a women.  Since this place looks like it's going to be or continue to be the next big thing in Vegas, we should have at least 2 stalls for each sex, in case one gets tied down.  And you know that happens...  

Lastly, my only hope is that they do not grow too big.  Meaning they don't make too many locations.  Keep it original and stay as is.  Don't oversaturate the market.  Give me a reason to go to this one location for a while.",0,2,0

Saturday morning, my fella and I went out for breakfast, and we chose Mr. Mama's due to its super close location, and good reviews.  Ok, the $30 for $15 Yelp Deal sealed the deal for us. 

The first thing that struck me as great was that the owner greeted us,  took our name, since there was a short wait, but assured us that it would be less than 15 minutes.  It was about a 5 minute wait, which isn't bad at all.  

All of the staff that we encountered were very friendly, and pleasant.  
Our server was great, offering suggestions, and highlighting the specials.  

We ended up ordering: 
The Greek Omelette with hash browns and Texas Toast 
A side of Biscuits and Gravy
Clam Chowder
Grits
Philly Cheese steak
Coffee

The good: 
Free refills on the coffee, and your choice of french vanilla creamer or half and half.  I like this in a breakfast place.  I don't like to pay $2.50 a cup, when I have 2-2.5 cups...that's just too much.  So I liked the free refills option.

The Philly Cheese Steak was to DIE for.  Cooked perfectly, and perfectly seasoned. 

Now,the ""not bad, but not super good"" and the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5. 
The rest of our food was bland.  It was GOOD, but it wasn't seasoned well at all.  We had to add salt and pepper to everything...clam chowder, the omelette (even with all that feta), the grits, and the hash browns.  I normally don't ever add salt or pepper to my dishes, but these needed them.  
Everything else was great...the eggs were cooked perfectly, the grits were a trip back in time for me, to Nashville trips with my dad, and the biscuits and gravy were pretty good too.  We both really enjoyed the clam chowder as well. 

All in all, the trip was good.  We would have liked to have had better seasoning on most of the food, but it was still good.  

I'd come back, for sure.  There are lots of things on the menu that I'd like to try, and you really just can't beat the service!",9,4,5

I'm not in love with the setup, just a bunch of low sitting tables all spread out. No booths or dividing walls. 

Food:

I ordered an egg white omelette with added chicken, avocado, and spinach with side of fruit. Omelette cooked perfectly. Great taste.

I also ordered a short stack of pancakes as well. The pancakes were fluffy and great taste. I have a big sweet tooth for breakfast - I didn't see much for options with their pancakes or French toast. 

If this place had more sweet options, I would have given it a five.
I should have ordered the cinnamon roll...

I tapped into the Yelp Hive-mind, which gave Mr. Mamas rave reviews, and I immediately experienced why... Incredibly fresh food, generous portions (without being ridiculous), super friendly service, and great value. I've been back probably 10 times, with friends, with family, with clients\/colleagues, and solo... I have NEVER been disappointed, and can't recommend it highly enough.

During my trip with my boyfriend to Vegas, we stopped here for breakfast one day based on the great reviews. I would give the experience, price, and service 5 stars for sure but meal wise it's a 2 star for me.

So let's start with service and experience. When we got there, there was a line outside. But surprisingly the wait was no longer than 15 minutes. And coming from a major metropolitan, that was amazing!

When we were seated the waitress was really nice and friendly. She checked up on us and the whole 9. Taking it a step further, one of the other employees saw us taking selfies and offered to take pictures of us together. Overall, very nice people.

Now, the food. Very nicely displayed. But I got a bacon and cheddar omelette which was decent but nothing spectacular. My boyfriend bought corned beef hash and was very displeased. It had all the corned beef and no hash (felt like we were delivered some fake news).

But here is the cherry on top. We ordered a side of pancakes. It looked really good - large size and couldn't complain. We go to take a bite? And it tasted like a pancake made from mix straight out of the box. Definitely my least favorite pancakes ever. 

So, I really wanted to love this place but the food deceived me. But I guess you get what you get for the price. I probably will not be returning here.",0,0,0

I have read about how highly this place was rated, but I was skeptical. It was not until they offered the yelp deal that I made the leap. I can make breakfast at home, so why should I come here to pay for it? I now understand why. 

First of all, the service was incredible. We arrived around 11 am expecting to wait, but there was no wait, and we were quickly seated. The staff was friendly, quick, informative, and more than willing to help. It's so rare to find a place where people just ooze top quality service, especially at these prices. 

The pricing really is phenomenal. You can eat lunch here for just about $10 including tip. 

We tried the cinnamon roll to start, and it did not disappoint. It was warm and fresh and oh so fluffy. It was a great way to start the day. 

The biscuits were top notch. Fluffiness seems to be a theme here, and I appreciated how fresh these biscuits were. 

I also did not understand the hype over the hash browns, but now I do. They came to the table incredibly hot and well seasoned. They weren't too crispy, which is perfect for me. 

The pancakes were pretty good. They were tough to cut, but the flavor was strong and traditional. 

The reuben sandwich was very well received at our table, which is certainly saying something when a place is known for breakfast, and our reuben aficionado can be picky. 

We will definitely be back. This warm, neighborhood restaurant is truly top quality.",1,0,1

They're in a strip mall with heavily tinted windows, giving the impression that no one is in. Once you're inside, you'll see how happenin' the place is. There was a 15-20 minute wait on Sunday morning at 10:30 am. It's worth it though, so tough it out by using the waiting time to pick what you want to order and see what others have ordered.

We got an all brunch spread with a cinnamon roll ($3.75), a pancake ($2.85), a side order of 2 sunny side up eggs ($3.00), a meat & cheese omelet with home fries and toast ($9.75), and coffee ($2.50). First up was the cinnamon roll - the size of a dinner plate. It's a must order. I knew the cinnamon roll would be filling so I only ordered one pancake, rather than a stack of two. It too was the size of a dinner plate and was oh so fluffy. The omelet comes with your choice of ham, sausage or bacon for meat and your choice from over six variety of cheeses (we ordered Monterey jack, but somehow got American cheese when the omelet came). BF thought the home fries were the circular ones in the Yelp photos, but they were cubed crisp seasoned potatoes. So so good! Two pieces of toast accompanies the omelet as well.

Service was fantastic. BF's coffee cup never went empty for long. They also helped us take a picture when noticing us taking pictures of the food. Mr. Mamas himself went the effort of taking a high level shot by standing on a chair to get a full shot of us at the table with all the food included.

We left full -- too full! -- and ready to take a lazy Sunday nap.",3,1,4

You will more than likely wait for a table but the service is quick. The receptionist at the door was very friendly and told me it would only be about 15 minutes and he said if you can't wait 15 minutes for their food then you should probably go somewhere else. He was joking of course. 

If you have small children it is probably best to order one breakfast for them and split it between them. I am giving you fare warning that the short stack of pancakes is enough to satisfy Paul Bunyan and his pal Babe the blue ox. Seriously, it was a lot of food for my kids and most of it went to waste. My wife ordered a cinnamon roll and that thing is about the size of a water balloon. It was a lot of roll, so I did what good husbands do and I ate most of it. She also went with a veggie omelet and said it was good. I had the country fried steak. They make a special gravy for it. It is plenty of food for you to share. I was feeling like a pig that day, so I truly was what I ate. 

It's a great place to stop for breakfast. Excellent service and great food. Simple and inexpensive. Get away from that resort you are staying at and make the drive just a few minutes west of the strip. I guarantee that it will be much better than that overpriced breakfast available downstairs at your hotel (that's unless you are staying at the best hotel ever with incredible breakfast). I'm sure the locals want to keep this place a secret. Happy eating!",10,6,11

I was looking for some good breakfast for a good price, I scored! The service was impeccable...My server was Julie and everyone else that walked by our table! They really work together here to make sure you never need to ask for anything. I ordered the special which was the ABC omelette. It had avocado, bacon, and choice of cheese, I chose pepper jack! It was really good. I got fruit instead of potatoes and I am happy I did! The fruit medley consisted of fresh strawberries, blueberries, pineapple, and honeydew. I also got a fresh, hot, buttery biscuit instead of toast. My breakfast was $9 and it came with coffee\/ soft drink\/ tea choice. I had coffee and it was good and fresh! 

Hubby ordered rib eye steak and eggs for $10! He got his with hashbrowns and a muffin and coffee of course!  He mentioned to Julie that we were travelling for 8 hours and she brought him a large take out cup for his coffee and filled it up!

Customer services: A+ ( all servers are extremely friendly and helpful. Constantly checking in to see if you need your coffee refills or need anything at all. Working in the servicing industry myself, I am definitely big on customer service and satisfaction and I give the whole serving crew including the owner a 5 Stars. 

Food: A ( ordered the French toast with 2 eggs, the egg Benedict with hash brown , and the Marty wrap plus 2 coffees. Food is great! It's traditional American breakfast and I say the food is actually better than some fancy restaurant that serves brunch that I have been to in LA. It's not the best I have ever had but I would say it's better than a lot of places for friction of the price. Coffee is good by the way. 

Setting: B (Danny's - like setting or regular mom and pop shop. Definitely not a fancy brunch place but rather a family friendly setting and the food is pretty good. )

Price: A ( it's pretty cheap compare to places in LA ! And I purchased the $15 for $30 deal on Yelp when I came to this place so it's definitely a steal! For all that food and coffee that we ordered , our total bill came out to be less than $30 even! And of course I have actually only paid $15 for all that because of the Yelp deal. So it's a Win!!! But make sure you tip on the full price and more because these people deserve it! 

Overall: A = 5 Star from me. I agree with rest of the yelp reviews that it is a great place. Will recommend and come again!",3,0,0

From there, our server just continued the chain, and we were attended to with tea and coffee never getting empty.

Date had the patty melt (very, very good) and I had the Cali omelette based upon Yelp recommendations. The hive mind was useful: the Cali omelette was indeed something to try and I would recommend it to others. Bonus points they have sour dough toast here, and use real butter on it!

The food: pretty standard breakfast fare -- no exotic options here.  I went with chicken fried steak.  The steak seemed a little pre-fab (my only complaint) but was very well seasoned (thank you!).

I visited at 11a on a Friday dying to try the much loved and yelped chicken fried steak. I was greeted, or was a by a hostess amongst many at a cashier table near the door. She took my name, noted the time and quoted me 10-15 minutes. Although there were several open tables and not more Than another couple waiting I shrugged it off to wash my hands. And the bathrooms are, ...functional.?.  I also spotted a delicious, largish CFS on the way back to wait. 

When I sat down to wait another hostess, checked my name, verified party of one, rolled her eyes ( at the other hostess who didn't seat me) and plunked me down at a nice table in back where I could see the action. 

Server came over quickly, took drink order and offered lemon in the water. I ordered chicken fried steak without further delay. She asked if I wanted to try the gravy because ""it's different."" So I've heard and read. I just said bring it and quickly.

Pancakes walking by,  four high. 
Corned beef hash next door. 
Water refills quickly, coffee, non stop pour. 
Tickets out the window, two stories high.

The CFS was a winning bet. Large nicely breaded and fried. Eggs and hash browns were good. It took almost forever for some wheat toast, but when it came out if it wasn't the softest freshest butterest toast I've ever had. In other words worth the wait.

Our server, Jacqui, greeted us within a minute, and took our orders with a smile.

We ordered:
-French Toast with Bacon ($7.75) - Comes with two slices of French toast, the French toast was tasty and wasn't overly soggy either which I appreciate.  The server asked if I wanted my bacon crispy or soggy, I love that they ask you this and give you the option!  I opted for crispy and it was delicious. 
-Two Eggs and Toast with Sausage Patties ($6.95) - I'm still impressed with how cheap this dish was!  You can pick between bacon, sausage patties, or ham.  My friend opted for the sausage patties.  You also get a choice of toast and hash browns\/home fries.  I was able to steal some home fries off my friend's plate and honestly thought it was just okay, didn't eat anything else of theirs.
-Cinnamon Roll (forgot the price!) - Either my friend and I are dummies for not being able to find this on their menu or it wasn't listed on their menu.

You will not believe the experience I just had at MR.MAMAS !

From the time you step to the front door you are greeted with a warm and inviting smile. Seated Swiftly, greeted again by another team member. Drink order was taken immediately. Greeted again by another amazing staff member.

The menu is just right! 
I ordered The Mama's French toast with scrambled eggs and cheese with bacon and a side of grits. (Wait until I tell you about these grits)

The French toast you can taste the cinnamon sprinkled on top... Fluffy. Mmmmmmmm
Not a fan of eggs, however they were also fluffy and tasty with the perfect amount of cheese.

NOW THESE GRITS!
My Mama (get it) lol. In my opinion makes the best grits to man kind. She's in NYC. Second from her grit is Mike from The Home of Chicken and Waffles in the Bay area. Now Mr.Mamas is added to the list. I love my grits with a little lump and airy. Mr.Mamas grits is life.

My Husband ordered Mr.Mamas pancakes.
The pancakes was the size of your head. For the first time in history my husband was not able to finish his food. I was so happy that he met his match.

The pancakes by the way fluffy and the syrup soaks into the pancake....so tasty.

Looking around the the restaurant, everything is so clean, organized in place the equipment look brand new out the box but it's not. I was in HEAVEN! For me to be such a foodie and dine out a lot I never truly feel comfortable and safe eating food from others maybe it's the inspector in me 

Oh yeah! A really awesome employee took a really great picture of us at the table with our food from a great angle...thanks buddy

Our server Eileen, sweet as pie, very nice not over baring....just perfect

I also noticed that all the staff is happy with each other, helpful like a team and having a good time being at work. Great Atmosphere

I had the pleasure of meeting Mr.MAMA. GREAT GUY. FEELS LIKE THAT FAVORITE UNCLE WHO YOU CALL TO GET YIU OUT OF TROUBLE WITH OUT JUDGING YOU BUT WILL GIVE YOU A STERN LECTURE AND HUG YOU AFTER.

You claimed that you were never informed about the potato being rotten but that is actually false. As I exited the bathroom the first thing I heard from your voice was loud and clear, ""Are you going to pay?"" This is before me and my boyfriend were able to explain anything. I remember because I was actually upset and crying and none of your employees stopped to ask what was wrong. Except the manger, but I assume he felt like his hands were tied behind his back in this situation. After you asked such an off-setting question Daniel was feeling extremely upset because of how upset I was from placing a rotten potato in mouth. Clearly he did not have the answer you wanted or even had an answer at all at first because it was such bad timing. Daniel told me that he did in fact present the potatoes to you in a napkin that you grabbed and threw away and you told him to leave if he wasn't paying. Now if I'm being honest, me and Daniel never had any intention of not paying we just wanted to know what happened to the potatoes but it seemed like us not paying was your only concern which escalated the situation. Daniel is nowhere near a violent person but on the other hand you were in his face and you did physically rush him to leave the store from ""not paying"". You threaten him by claiming you were an ex fighter, you never gave him person space while leaving the store and you shouted telling us to get out. I felt like my boyfriend was in a position that any human would have gotten extremely upset in. And this is a scene which all of your employees and customers witnessed but it's a shame if they agree with us they could lose their job so of course the situation is biased. I even have pictures of me and Daniel having a wonderful (non threatening) time in your restaurant right before the incident, which if I can figure out how to post them I will. We also loved our waiter and my Jenna wrap was perfect so basically the situation could've been a lot different if you had just put the customer first instead of counting pennies and being so concerned about us paying or not. But right now it's your word against ours but the situation is now in the past. We just felt like  after the cops left our side of the story was not being heard or understood. (The cops did agree with me and Daniel that you were a hot head even towards them but that is besides the point.) Like I said in the beginning this was one of our top 5 breakfast joints until this terrible memory that I will never be able to look past. 

(This is an update from re-reading your first reply, I would also like to clarify that we were never charged with anything from the cops so that is a false statement from you. The cops let us go because they realized how ridiculous the entire encounter was. If we were truly being as threatening as you claim then the cops would have taken different precautions. Thank you and goodbye.)

The pressure (read others have stated similar) to give a good review on yelp from the owner and staff makes u feel like you are there for the benefit of marketing thier company not enjoying a meal with your friends.   My daughter tried the French toast and ate just a few bites ..  overloaded sugar high of chocolate and powder sugar not flavor.

I am certian with the reading of the other reviews and the indirect nudge they must be getting these ratings unethically or with reward because it's not due to 5 star food or service.  I'm perplexed.  Just a average joint with below average atmosphere and nothing to write home about service.   The smell of funny business going on here.   Losing faith in the validity of yelp.

I was getting out of UNLV and tried to search for a good local breakfast restaurant and found Mr. Mamas. The restaurant name may sound strange but the food is TO DIE FOR! 

As we drove into the shopping center on October 14, 2016, we thought no way the parking is full around Mr. Mamas. As we found a parking spot and went into the restaurant, there was the host\/manager standing right next to the door ready to serve us in. As we sat at a table, our server was coming her way ready to order.

We ordered:
- Orange Juice
- French Toast
- Mamas Short Stack

We only waited about 6 minutes and the food was coming our way! When I first tried my short stack, I was SHOCKED! I've never seen pancakes so FLUFFY and so HUGE before! The taste of it was just so MOUTHWATERING, it just was so buttery. I also tried a little of the French Toast and it was GOOD also! As I next tried the ham, UMM! SO GOOD! The ham was soft to chew and had GOOD FLAVOR!

The service here was GOOD. It seems the manager and our server cares about their customers since they ask, ""How's the food?"" and ""How's the service?""
This place is a good place to eat, much better than iHop. I RECOMMEND this place because the food comes out FRESH and QUICK especially in big portions! Also, they CARE about their customers' sarisfaction.",5,3,3

Yesss, mr mamas is packed with eye candy hunny... with all due respect of course! The decor simple 50s diner vibes.  Very busy, in this case a good sign,  never have enjoyed brunch with a side of crickets.  As for the food we ordered ribeye and eggs, hash with peppers and onions, French toast,  and bacon.  With the best first French toast was totally my favorite.  Really well executed and delicious,  eggs cooked a bit under what id desired as was the steak over. For the worst.... which really isn't so bad my hash browns. You know how some restaurants hash is sort of like hash on the outside but mash on the inside? Yes thats what those were. It was not enough to make me change my mind about the awesomeness of this place though.  Id still highly recommend it to anyone.  Cant wait to come back and  try more!",1,0,3

The gravy on your biscuits and gravy and country fried steak... lolz. I almost feel like if there was a gravy religion this would be considered blasphemy... id prefer a false prophet because at least that tastes good. 

Your potato chips... yes potato chips, I know they are called something else but that is what they are except... no salt... no pepper... no special seasonings. Heres a fried potato round. Enjoy?

The eggs were alright, nothing that made me say hey these are a delicious.com. These are more likely to appear on diy.com.  '

There is just nothing here that made me say wow. It seems like a nice establishment and it has a great staff but the food just made me a little sad... like rudolph being shunned by santa sad. 

THE VERDICT: so here is my conspiracy theory... they werent satisfied with there 4.5 star rating so they moved so they could get back up to 5. I realize that my opinion is very much the minority... but I stand by it. PS its really out of the way from the city. Wow... im getting more and more blown away by all the 5 stars... but hey its vegas people are intoxicated so... it makes sense.",12,15,2

I had the eggs Benedict florentine, a short stack of pancakes and my bf had the biscuits and gravy. Both love our meals! The hashbrowns are heavenly. Such a simple side dish, but   they were the star of my meal. The owner was walking around chatting up the guests and helping his employees.  He seems to truly love the food industry and his job.

Every staff member goes out of their way to make you feel welcome and that they appreciate your business. We came here the day after a long night out with hangovers. The breakfast (eaten more at lunchtime) was just what we needed. We got french toast, a build-your-own omelette, and started with a bowl of beef vegetable soup (weird I know but I wanted something substantial in my tummy fast) plus coffee and soda. The omelette was great -  we ordered it with ham and mushrooms plus fresh slices of avocado on top - it wasn't greasy like you often get at diners, so I was happy. The french toast was just ok - bread tasted not so fresh. Home fries that came with the omelette were ok, but not as crisp or as seasoned as we like. Beef vegetable soup had great flavor and tasted like something my mom would make (that's a good thing). In short, I'd give the service a five star and the food a three star - so I rounded it to an overall 4 star.",0,0,0

We were hungry and the sign read Breakfast and lunch. We were like let's give it a go. So glad we did. The staff was amazing. Melissa was our hostess\/waitress. She was very nice and friendly. She kept our water glasses filled as well as my coffee. The food was good and you get big portions. So big I had leftovers for breakfast this morning. The manager was nice and welcoming. She welcomed everyone as they came in the door. Steve( I hope that's his name) was also nice and made sure the guest were seated in a timely manner. The place was busy all day. Big groups were coming and going as we enjoyed our food. Thank goodness it was just the two of us as we were seated really fast. I will definitely be going back to Mr. Mamas in the near future!,0,0,0

I saw Mr Mamas on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  Easy location and parking always a plus.  Food was good but not the ""best I have ever eaten"".  The thing that turned us off and we won't be back is the grilling it felt like we got from the wait person and apparently the owner.  Before our order was taken the waitress wanted to know if we had been there before, how we found out about them, had we been to the previous location.  When I mentioned we learned about them from Yelp she went on to say they were previously the # 1 breakfast in Vegas but since they moved they had to start over and build up their Yelp account.  Food was fast and good.  Now here comes the owner I guess making the rounds asking the same questions and telling every table they used to be  the # 1 breakfast in Vegas and 3 in the country or something (by now I was shutting it off) but now they have to start over.  You know 1st of all the meal was good, not the best I've ever eaten and I don't need to feel like my meal is dependent upon writing a review for various sites.

The service overall was very good, and the owner walks around checking up on people. Sometimes I think this can be weird, but in this case, I loved it because he seemed very genuine.
