We stayed at the Planet Hollywood, and every time we were in the casino we could see a huge line to get into this place, so we figured we would check out the champagne brunch since it seemed to be so popular. 

What can I say, I ate a BUNCH of food and drank a BUNCH of champagne, but the food was just eh. I know it's a buffet but for something called the SPICE MARKET, they should use a little more spice to spruce up that bland food. The only thing that saved it was the awesome guy that wouldn't let my champagne glass get anywhere near empty!",1,1,1

I came here eons ago for dinner, and thought it was awful... Years later, I come in for some breakfast and it was... Still terrible. Different course menu, same end result. It's no wonder it's never busy.

The food is obviously drying up under the heat lamps, and none of it is fresh. You know that one dish you keep going back to? Well this buffet didn't even have that for me. The variety SHOULD be ample, but it really wasn't. The pancakes and waffles tasted like cardboard. Just wouldn't come back here again. Had better buffets for $4.99 at The Red Rock.",1,2,1

They're the biggest and easiest to eat. I love how they were cut in half so you don't have to waste time trying to open them yourself. The steamed crab legs were dry, but the cold ones were juicy and sweet. I also liked the shrimp & cocktail sauce and beef kebabs. I can't say much else about their food since I gorged myself on crabs and dessert. 

I came here at 6:30 on a Wednesday, but the line wasn't too long.",2,1,1

Seriously, when I pay, I at the very least expect somewhat decent food.

Well, low and behold, after finally arriving in Las Vegas around 7:30 in the morning, I was famished and wanted to eat something! Anything! Being that my friend and I stayed at Planet Hollywood (what it is now), he did some gambling and actually got himself a voucher for a free buffet. So, why the heck not? Even though in the back of my mind, I did cringe a little when it was mentioned because of the horrible time I had last time. We were off!

The buffet was around $14 and change. I was surprised that they had a make-your-own-waffle station (you actually ask one of the cooks to put the batter into the waffle maker and wait), make-your-own-omelette station  (same premise, but you get a small array of veggies - onions, mushrooms, green peppers, ham, and cheese). I don't know what's happened to me, but after taking a nicely, freshly made waffle (with the ""PH"" Planet Hollywood logo on it), my omelette, roast beef with horseradish sauce, bacon, and sausage, I was done. No more! The thing I did notice, I actually enjoyed the food! If you're staying here and want a decent breakfast buffet, this is were I'd probably go to.",1,0,1

Let's start off with the fact that the waiting line is located super close to some of the dining areas. My group was seated near the entrance of the buffet and the line got ridiculously long that some of the people were standing right in front of us. Normally this wouldn't really be that much of a problem, but it does when they are standing in the way of me and my path to food.

Its your average buffet with food ranging from mediterranean to asian to mexican to seafood. I'm a seafood lover so I will ALWAYS find myself heading straight to the crab legs ;) What can I say? I want to get my moneys worth. This buffet has 2 small trays with crab legs =( It's quite depressing when I'm use to the World Carnival Buffet at the Rio having a HUGE selection on crab legs. I still found myself getting 2 plate servings though. If there's crab legs, I'm eating it.

Nothing else was really appealing to me. I had some of their 3-cheese ravioli which I found too heavy even for italian food. The pesto alfredo was alright - nothing worth raving about OR putting down. I guess the last thing I can add about this place is it is poorly lit. It's a little dim for my liking, but that's a personal preference.

All in all, this buffet may just be a pass for me. There are better buffets out there with higher quality in food and bigger selections.",3,1,0

They have Mediterranean food as well. They have great choice of meat on the grill like a brazilian steak house would fresh, flavorful and juicy. There dessert area is full of over 15 different cupcakes which my favorite was the rum with vanilla cheesecake custard fill.  You can also find cheesecake, bread pudding, and ice cream.  If you are looking for seafood this also a great place to go too they serve hot and cold crab legs and you can find shrimp scampi as well as a assortment of shrimp.

1) Food: Nothing special other than very organized layout.  They had it by region (Middle Eastern, Mexican, Salad, Desserts, American, Italian) so the food wasn't mixed with others and each area had short lines which made it nice.  The food overall wasn't anything special.  The only thing different than any other buffet that I have experienced was the ""COTTON CANDY"".  Talk about nostalgia and so I had to have one.  Let's just say no more sugar was needed the rest of the day or week for that matter.

2) Price: The holiday pricing for buffet is more expensive (by about $10-15 more) so go the wynn if you haven't already.  So far, they have the best buffet for the best price. (speaking on all meals EXCEPT for breakfast...go to Main street station for that....)

It was nice to compare with other buffets on the strip but wouldn't go back.  The management staff was horrible at figuring out groups and seating people.  Don't go during the holidays..it's chaos. 

Harrah's management overall is HORRIBLE.  They need a staff training and too bad for Planet Hollywood.  When it was operated under Starwood and Sheraton Properties, they were much more together.  Boy will I miss this hotel!",0,1,0

Ok so besides that irritating me, I must say, this has been one of the worst buffets I've tried in Vegas. Save that $15. Go to the M Resort for $10 instead or try the Wynn for breakfast. They are so much better.

I must have came in on bad day.

[First impression]
Whoa.. It's big!

There's so much it's hard to believe it's not $50+ per person. It was $30 the day we went which happened to be Mother's Day and we were told there were additional food that they usually don't serve which is why it cost a bit more. I believe on a typical day, it's about $20. Still, they've got all these stations with themed food such as Mediterranean, Asian, Seafood, Pizza, Salad, etc. This beats the Bellagio buffet in my book. 

[Suggestion]
*You can ask for a half or a quarter of a waffle at the waffle station. That way you won't fill up or feel as guilty having a whole one.

這間自助餐位於賭場正中央的地下室，進出全憑著這個手扶梯來引導人群，位置並不難找。



在第一次造訪時，好不容易排隊下了手扶梯，眼前的排隊人潮卻一樣洶湧，無奈之後還有行程要趕只好放棄，等到下次再訪賭城時再來。



第二次造訪，用餐的人數比起第一次可以說是天壤之別，一樣是在週末時段但完全不用排隊。在餐點之外，也可以用相當實惠的價格來加點包括酒精性飲料的無限暢飲，包括多種紅酒和啤酒等，可以說是這裡最大的特色。



擺放著當地媒體頒發的獎牌，還沒開始巡禮各個風格的餐臺前，心中確實是有所期待的，餐點種類包括中東風格、美式、亞洲、墨西哥、義大利與甜食等。



這裡提供的蟹腳是雪蟹蟹腳，如果是以原價來吃的話看到這有些瘦小的蟹腳是會讓人有些失望的，但是以折扣券來吃的話還算是可以接受的內容。



這裡的肉類食材區的內容，要讓人勾起食慾是有些難度，雖然像是火雞、牛肋排這欸常見的肉品外，還有碳烤蔬菜和醃製過的中東風味烤串，但零零落落的擺放看起來並不是太可口。



整體的餐點種類說不上特別的豐富，看起來也沒有特別亮眼的食材，算是中規中矩的內容。



帶殼、尺寸平凡，光是前述兩點就已經讓人想要打槍這裡提供的鮮蝦，但其肉質彈性和甜度還可以。



墨西哥風味的餐點在美國受到歡迎的程度可以說是如日中天，在這裡的餐臺上也算是內容比較豐富的。



查理從來都不會在享用自助餐時特別來品嚐麵包這道會佔據大量肚皮空間的餐點，但經過時特別看了幾眼，好像還不錯的感覺。



雖然雪蟹蟹腳並不算是太肥美的等級，但以折扣價格來享用的話還可以吃到蟹腳算是不錯的，肉質的甜度也算及格。



不知道負責服務的廚師是不是覺得我應該要減重了，給了我這一片薄切的烤牛肋排差點哭笑不得，但還好口味和口感不會太差。



在自助餐中能看到西班牙海鮮燉飯，應該算是一件讓人驚喜的事，用料也還算實在，香味如果能更突出應該會更受歡迎。



海鮮類的食材說不上肥美，但是鮮度都還算是有水準，沒有吃到太讓人意外的口味。



分為好幾大類的餐臺，從每種都只拿起一些食物來試試味道，也是造訪自助餐的有趣之處。



比薩和起司的內容看起來就比較單薄，建議把肚皮裡有限的空間留給自己喜歡的食材。



餐點的內容勉強算是差強人意，要提昇用餐的感受別忘記這裡的酒精性飲料可是有包括在內，喜歡喝幾杯黃湯下肚帶有微醺感的朋友要好好把握。



在亞洲風味區看到的味噌湯，這道經常出現在自助餐的湯品用料還算豐富，在飽嘗食物與各式酒類後喝些湯暖暖肚皮還挺舒服的。



多數的食物品質都比較平凡，但還是有一兩種會讓人比較滿意的，像是這個以厚實魚片捲起來烘烤的魚排，魚肉香氣有烤出來，口感也不賴。



在這裡可以吃到的地中海風格料理，以Pita餅來搭配各種配菜和醬料一起吃還不錯。



中式、西式、海鮮、肉類、麵食等等，自助餐的魅力就是可以一次品嚐各種不同風格的餐點，以種類的豐富程度來彌補食物本身離精緻路線比較遠的先天限制。



甜食區的種類選擇說不上豐富，逛了一圈以後還是決定先去熟食區再拿一些食物來消磨時光。



在享用主餐之餘，也到墨西哥餐區拿一些玉米脆片，加上包括莎莎醬、酪梨醬、酸奶油、灑上起司絲，當作下酒菜來配酒，也是另外一種享受自助餐的方式，酒酣耳熱再來吃些甜食解解酒。



甜、甜、甜，如果以甜度來分類的話，這裡的甜食應該算是重口味的，吃些水果來中和一下。



在各式糕點中，這個草莓和奶油組合而成的杯子蛋糕，是其中看起來最討喜的。



如果喜歡美式杯子蛋糕的朋友們，這裡的甜食是以杯子蛋糕為主，應該會吃得相當開心的。



照慣例在餐後喝杯熱咖啡來解膩提神，飽餐一頓後拿個棉花糖在手上邊走邊吃也挺俏皮的。



Planet Hollywood 就名稱與品牌定位來說，應該是要帶給人一種跟好萊塢連結的華麗喧鬧感，但實際上的自助餐內容卻說不上讓人有太深刻的印象。



雖然蠻喜歡Planet Hollywood的環境，尤其是到與其相連的購物中心逛逛，但下次來這裡的時候應該會換換其他的餐廳試試，但就像之前所說的以預算為優先考量的話，這裡的自助餐在使用優惠購買後算是物有所值的用餐去處。",0,0,0

I did love two specific items offered at Spice that was very unique that I really liked. They actually offered hummus and hot flat bread in the mid-eastern style cuisine section and also offered sicilian cannolis in the dessert area. This was a definite plus in my book considering I never see these two items in any other buffets.

The decor and ambience are decent, but it looks like any other mid-end restaurant down there, right down to the TVs placed at strategic spots showing sports.  Hey, if you can't draw customers in for the breathtaking atmosphere.. can't really blame them though, as this venue is actually in the basement of the building.

Yes, the variety in terms of ethnicities is probably among the better buffets in the Harrah's chain, but the food here is mediocre to be honest.  Maybe I was just spoiled as I had hit the Bacchanal (Caesar's) first, followed by Le Village (Paris) before this, but I felt the food was honestly nothing special, especially compared to food back home (Vancouver).

I got in about 9:45 pm. My friend went to go find parking and I waited in short, yet slow line to go in. After waiting in line I showed them my Groupon they said I had to pay the tax on it. It was about 4 dollars, but I didn't have it on me since I didn't expect to pay anything additional. Usually if there is any additional fees the Groupon would state it, I already talked to them about this. FYI prepare to pay the taxes on your Groupon there. 
I guess my fault for not having extra on me and leaving it in the car. Anyway, back to the buffet. 
The buffet closes at 11pm. I finally went around and saw the trays were empty and the food was cold. Just like everyone has been saying...the crab legs are cold and the butter looks like lard. The employees are more occupied with cleaning, rather than making sure the trays are warm. Cold food=not happy.
I was looking forward to dessert since the food selection was bare and cold, and on the site it says that they have a Crepe station. I didn't see anyone at the station. After I had other dessert and was full, I saw the lady working the crepe station come back. Too late! 
To make matters worst, it was our last night in Las Vegas and we were supposed to go clubbing. Two of the friends felt too sick after the buffet and we didn't end up going :(
The only thing I loved about this was that our waitress never once hesitated to refill our drinks and let us know all the selection that was available.
While there I saw some girls flirting with the manager. They were given ""to-go boxes."" Two of them flirted and laughed with he manager as the other one filled boxes with desserts. I thought it was funny so I snapped some pictures. I don't want anyone to get in trouble, so I won't post.

The cashiers here are super slow, now I understand that people with high level players cards get to go first BUT come on. It's not hard to take money!! When we finally got up to pay I found out my daughter was $19.99, she's 4!!! I guess if your kid eats pure crab, I'm talking pounds it MIGHT be worth it but I don't know of any 4y\/o's that will eat $20 in food!! The groupon was already purchased or else we would have left. 

As soon as we were shown to our table I made a a b - line for the crab. I had to go to the soup area for a dish for butter. When I got back to the table I picked out all the meat from the split crab legs. I went to dip some crab in butter and it tasted awful. The butter was cold and gross. Here I am with some tasty crab but now I have to walk across the whole buffet to get butter. Now to this point I thought it was my fault, that I let it get cold. NOPE the next portion I got was room temp. at best. I said screw it and gave my crab to hubby who doesn't use butter. 

So now I went to search for food. The only things that really stood put was the prime rib, lamb kabob, potatoes au gratin, and  mac n cheese. All the food on the chinese, italian, greek, and seafood area looked old, dried up, or just plain gross. 

So the dessert area looked promising. Although having 14 different varieties of cupcakes seems down right stupid. They had flan, creme brulee, fruit tarts, soft serve, pre made crepes, and cotton candy to name a few. The 2 cupcakes I tried were inedible. They pre make the crepe pancakes put them in a dish and when you order one they heat it up and put mushy bananas or runny store bought macerated strawberries inside.  It was not good. The flan was okay and my kids loved the cotton candy. 

I left this place feeling like a dog with its tail between it's legs.  And I had a BOGO!  I feel bad for anyone paying the same per person here as Bellagio, Wynn, cosmo, or even Bacchanal.

The manager wearing the name tag ""Princess"" said we had to pay an extra fee of $10 per person to use the groupon. We even called last week to make sure it would be valid and the restaurant staff told us it would be. We showed the manager the website but she would not budge and insisted we had to pay $10 more per person and deal with groupon to resolve the issue.  The manager told us nobody there would have told us it would be valid today, she said we were lying. The party next to us in line was also told to come back today to use their groupon and the manager Princess said they were lying as well and nobody would've told them it was valid today.

Along with breakfast they had various lunch options with everything from soup and salads, Asian, Italian, Middle Eastern, and Seafood. They also offered many dessert options from pastries, crepes, and fresh fruit. 

Some of my highlights were the french toast which was dipped in cinnamon. The pineapple and cantaloupe were extremely fresh and juicy. Spicy Buffalo Shrimp and this Crab dish I can't think of the name were so good. I thoroughly enjoyed my crepe it would have been nice to just offer strawberry instead of mixed but the banana was good with chocolate sauce.

They told us it would be a while if we wanted to sit together. We opted to break our group up because me eat now. When we sat down, the table beside us left shortly after. They could have bussed the table beside us and sat us all together, but it sat dirty until we left... I guess in the melee that is dinner, things go the wayside. 

It was crab-tastic. It was a hard fight though because you have to throw elbows to get near it... and there is lots. That's all I had... oh and some grilled veggies. Actually, I lie. I had meat... a nice slice of prime rib. Oh and some creme brulee. I never make it past the dessert area because that to me signals the end.

However, the price was roughly $30\/person without the Buffet of buffets.  The buffet included non-alcoholic drinks.  Like a lot of buffets, The Spice Market divided the food into different ethnic foods more or less.  Popular foods in America such as Mexican and Italian had its own separate areas but other categories included Mediterranean and Asian.  I also remember a seafood and dessert area.

They did have sushi in the seafood area.  The sushi was all very fresh which is not always the case in a buffet setting.  Spice Market also included crab legs which did not require any additional charge.  If the buffet still has these following items I recommend them: wild mushroom pasta (in the Italian section) and the egg custard bun (in the Asian section).  The desserts were decedent and delicious.  Eat the dessert.  

Groupon was selling a deal for this particular buffet.  There are also coupons floating around in the Vegas area.  Like I said above, we did the Buffet of buffets.  We liked this buffet the most.

1. Le Village Buffet @ Paris
2. Emperor's Buffet @ Imperial Palace
3. Carnival World Buffet @ Rio
4. Spice Market Buffet @ Planet Hollywood

Our last stop before heading out of Vegas.  We felt like we hit rock bottom after having experienced the Emperor's Buffet.  And it was a definite improvement to revisit a sure-thing at Rio.  The buffet at PH seemed much cleaner and more modern than the rest, so our anticipation was higher.

We were promptly seated, and there were even TVs that showed the game.  And they even had real cloth table napkins!

The selection wasn't amazing, but the quality was a half-step up from Rio, and a whole flight of stairs above Imperial Palace.  And yes, I referred to the buffets by their hotel name.

My friend really liked the chicken soup.  Ok, she loved it.  But I suspect she ""loved"" it cause she was hungover, and the ambience was such an upgrade from Imperial Palace.

I had to glance at the photos I took to jog my memory, and I got a dessert plate with 4 things.  It looked good, and I remember finishing the plate (instead of leaving it half-eaten like the dessert at Paris).  The next pic was of us standing at the exit giving a thumbs up.  Good way to round out the weekend.

Spice Market to me is the most interesting concept buffet I've seen. Being a foodie with access to some of the best buffet's outside of Vegas I hold the restaurant  type in high regard. There is quality and quantity and good amounts of both reside here. You can really only eat American or non ethnic foods for so long before getting absolutely bored and living, working and growing up in highly diverse communities I found a passion for flavors of the world. This is something that Vegas has failed to understand with the standard buffets at other casino's. Sure they have everything you'd expect from sausage, prime rib, crab legs, shrimp, pasta, burgers, etc, but they also have KBBQ, cous cous, vegetarian dishes besides vegetables, kabobs, spring rolls, pad thai, carne asada, lamb gyro. The deserts could be better, but honestly I think they just need to be more hip. Offer some cake pop's, some bread pudding and not just brownies and sundae's and chocolate fountains. The desert game is uncharted territory for them and usually only the big boys can really diversify into that level. Service is excellent and the price is marginally higher than comparable standard buffets at other casino's.

It basically is a multi ethnic food court stacked on top of a Vegas buffet. Lets face it the demographics speak for themselves in the people who come here and the people who live there and work there. Expose yourself to some culture, come eat here. It will remind you more of home when you've been in Vegas too long.

The bad thing is that I eat buffets pretty often so stuffing my face while out here is a flaw I've fixed. I've explored off the strip and found some gems, but if taking a 10 minute taxi isn't your thing and you want to stay within your casino\/hotel this is a fine establishment.",4,1,2

We went there for lunch on Monday and it was only $18.99 + tax. It was reasonable for Vegas and even for buffets...other hotels' buffets are more expensive seems like. 

I liked everything that I had there. From seafood (fresh fish, shrimps, and scallops), American fare, Italian fare, and Chinese fare were all delicious. I tempted to tried the Indian and Lebanese, but dear Lord, I didn't have any space left in my belly.

Maybe I should blamed that problem to the dessert bar. Those scrumptious creations were ridiculously amazing. The Creme Brulee...mmmm..nuff said.

We purchased the 24 hour buffet for one price which includes 6 different buffets on the strip. The 1st buffet that we went to was at the Rio absolutely amazing food & service. Later that evening we went to Planet Hollywood Spice Market Buffet. 1st off the area where the line is formed is so smsll got a little claustrophobic,  then once we were setted the waitress was unfriendly & made us feel as if she had something better to do other than wait on us. The Roast beef was dry & over cooked, the desert station didnt have much of a variety of deserts just cupcakes. Most of the meats in the Mediterranean station was over cooked & dry as well but the kick in the head was the cold crab legs. I've been to many buffets where if you ask the chef behind the serving station to heat yourcrab legs they are more than happy to heat them up for you. Well when I asked the cheft if he could please heat them for me he said they didn't do that, well then I said ok thank you & sat at my table where sconds later I saw waitresses walk by our table with plates of hot steamed crab, so I asked the waitress if we could have our crabs warm & steamed which she replied no they didn't do that. Then again we saw them walk by with more hot steamed crabs, we were like wth? We called the waitress over & asked to speak to a manager. The manager came to our table after about 10 minutes & we asked about having our crabs steamed. He had attitude & was arrogant & pompous.  He told us they only did that for VIPs.... seriously? W felt less than important not even be able to rate hot crab. Yet they didnt have VIPs in a seperate area,  They lied to us about not doing that & kept walking right by us with hot crab. He could have been a nice guy & said I will make that exception & I apologize but instead he took the douch route & acted like a jerk. I will never go to this buffet again.

I had very high expectations going into this place. Not only had I heard from other people that this was the best buffet in Vegas, but in front of the restaurant, there was a huge sign that said ""Best Buffet of 2007.""

The buffet is split into different sections, such as: seafood, Asian, Mexican, etc. For those who know me, it will not surprise you to know that I went for the seafood (the expensive stuff...aka Alaskan King Crab) first.

When I finally got to the seafood line, I could not believe what I saw. There was a line around 30-40 people long, waiting their turns to take MY crab. At the Bellagio, the crab was stationed in a very easy to reach setting and there was never more than a couple people waiting in line. At the Spice Market, I literally waited 15 minutes in line to get at the crabs.

After I had my fill of crab that took me about a million years to get, I went to go try the other dishes. Out of everything that I tried, Jeffrey's BBQ Ribs and the kabobs impressed me the most.

I tried to have a good time, but the waiting in line really spoiled it for me that evening. There are only 2 reasons people go to buffets: 1) all you can eat; 2) the instant gratification of having your food there, prepared and ready to go.

First off, $27.99 per adult for dinner, on a Monday?  That's Redonkulous with a capital ""R.""  Thankfully, I'm not complaining much because I got a BOGO coupon so technically, for the s\/o and I, it was only $14 each.

The buffet offerings were just okay.  Sure, they had crab salad and shrimp cocktail served in martini glasses but don't be fooled by it, it's not better quality, it's called perception.  They also had the usual Asian, Italian, American, Mediterranean and Seafood fare.  BTW, is it just me or do my fellow Asians act like savages when it comes to Crab Legs?  It's not like it's going to run out people, there's more where it came from, geez!

My mind automatically raises the buffet-bar when I step off the plane and into Sin City. So with that said, The Spice Market Buffet at Plant Hollywood was ehh.

There's a decent amount of food that stretches along the entire back wall of the buffet. It was kinda inconvenient for a hungry hound like myself. I had to use my legs and feet to walk, yes WALK, from one end of the buffet to the other. But along the way I found some interesting items [during lunch] that peak my interest, some good and some not. I found it very interesting that they had a decent selection of Middle Eastern food. Not many buffets that I've had to opportunity to try never cover that part of the globe.

Overall, taste and quality of food was aight. I wasn't really impressed, but I mean it got the job done.

What I was impressed with was the desserts. They've got a crepe-making station that wasn't half bad. They've got a few different fruits to put in the crepes [strawberries, cherries, banana, etc.] and they'll even throw on some whipped cream and chocolate sauce if you're into that kinda thing. The only thing that irked me was that the fruit was drenched in a sugary syrup, or as the kids call it ""sizzzzurp.""

Service was okay. Our server [are they still servers at buffets??] cleaned plates in a timely fashion, told us some stories and made some small talk.

I mean SMB was okay, don't get me wrong, but for the cost and quality of everything, I'm sure there are other buffets that would be a better bang for the buck [one in particular comes to mind]. But it's worth a whirl at least once.",0,0,0

We have been to other seafood buffets where we have been able to take our crab legs over to be boiled for a sec if u prefer them warm, which we do so that was very disappointing. Prior to coming to the buffet we looked in the ""buffet of buffets"" brochure and it stated that they steamed the crab legs. We approched the manager and showed him it and he was upset and stated ""we havent had steamed crab legs in 4 months"". After that we were not only diaappointed but also fustrated that things were falsly advertised. On top of that the food was very mediocre in our opinion and not very fresh.

Spice Market Buffet is located downstairs in the middle of the casino.  Not a very large buffet but I'm happy to say that they have rooms towards the back for large parties.  We were a party of 14 and with 5 Diamond members.  The front cashier was a bit rude.  Wish I got her name.  She was middle aged and worked on Thanksgiving Day around 4:00 pm.  She did not smile and had a straight face.  I asked if we could get seating for 14 people and she said we cannot seat your party if everyone isn't here.  Which was fine, we understood.  

My party of 5 paid for our buffet and explained to the person who was ready to seat us that we have a party of 14 but the other 9 is in the casino making their way down.  They wanted to charge us 18% upfront but we told them we already paid.  :(

Buffets seem so over-rated, and if they run into the $30-40 range you better have a healthy appetite. But, with work colleagues it seemed like a good idea, but we went for the cheaper option of Planet Hollywood @ $15. I was ready for the Wynn, but I heard Bellagio is the best.

When I asked, ""what's the difference since the Aladdin changed to Planet Hollywood?"", the lady at the reception said, ""nothing, just the name. The food and everything is the same!"" So there you have it. If you came to Aladdin in the past, you've been to The Spice Market too.

Would I come here again. Probably not, but it was pretty competent. The variety is fair: Middle-eastern (kebabs, falafel, feta cheese salad), Asian (think Panda Express with some not-so-great sushi added), Italian (Sbarro-style), seafood (king crab, cod fillet, salmon) and desserts. Pho's desserts were the best thing I think. You still had to be choosy though...but the chocolate-covered strawberries and small tarts were good. As was the crepe with apricots.

The variety they has wasn't bad and I especially liked the prime rib the most since it was served medium rare and wasn't tough or chewy like the one at Paris buffet. The crab legs were also good and I was only able to eat a few since I was so tired of eating the same foods after three buffets.

The interesting new items I tried were the country fried chicken in little small baskets which was tasteless and very bland. It was moist and juicy, but lacked any flavor. I also was able to try the fish and chips also served in small baskets and it also lacked any real flavor. It seriously needed some tarter sauce to help give it some taste.

The dessert area looked great with the many different kinds of cupcakes they had with multiple flavors to choose from. Too bad I wasn't able to sample any, but I did have the vanilla ice cream and it was just terrific. I'm not sure how they make it from custard cream, but it makes a big difference from your standard ice cream. It was very smooth and creamy like.

My husband got the worst case of food poisoning from this place. It totally ruined our trip to Vegas. Wanna know how bad it was?

It started out with him having diarrhea. For hours. He was finally able to get a couple of hours of sleep. We headed home. There was no traffic, but it took us 6 hours to get home. It shouldn't have taken no more than 4. It took so long because every few minutes we had to pull over so he could throw up. He couldn't even keep water down. He'd take a sip, we'd pull over, he'd puke up water.

HE COULDN'T EVEN KEEP ICE CHIPS DOWN.

Also, the food wasn't that great. Nothing to write home about. And it was fairly expensive. I can't remember exactly how much it was, but I do recall the distinct feeling that I was getting RIPPED THE EFFE OFF.

The line was long but moved pretty quickly and we soon excitedly entered the buffet, with its ""fare from around the world.""  While they did appear to have many stations from Middle-Eastern to Mexican, upon approaching the stations, we found that they had very few choices at each of those stations.  My mom was particularly dismayed at the seafood station, with its sorry selection of a few kinds of shrimp, a couple kinds of salmon, one more old looking fish and no crab or sushi in sight.  

I went for the Middle-Eastern food; the pita bread was on the harder side and the hummus watery.  Not good, not bad.  The pasta was possibly the worst I've had (made me think of cafeteria food) and there wasn't much I could eat from the Asian station, since I don't eat meat, other than seafood.  My dad and sister seemed to enjoy the few cuts of the meat they had at the American station.

After I tried the seafood, I walked around to look at all the food and see what I wanted.  I went to the salad bar, to make my favorite spinach salad but walked away when I saw a BUG about a half inch long in the spinach.  I thought to myself at first, oh my... well - I guess it is hard to wash every single bug out of the many pounds of spinach they must put out daily.  But it's a restaurant; shouldn't they be responsible for cleaning the vegetables enough to at least get out a large bug like that?

My sister was indifferent about all of the food, except for the bread and the tempura shrimp, which she liked.  Their garlic bread was my favorite thing there, other than a couple of the desserts, but I didn't pay $25 to eat bread.  The fruit was good, as was the dessert (I liked the cannoli), except for the crepe.  The best part was getting cotton candy from the dessert bar!  

All in all, the bland and poor quality of the majority of the food (and the bug), as well as the sad selection, outweighed the fun desserts and good bread.  I guess our expectations were too high for the buffet.

As for the food - there's a lot of selection and numerous ""stations"" with different ethnic foods to choose from.

I sampled mainly from the seafood; got crab legs, peel n eat shrimp, some buffalo popcorn shrimp (yum!), some sushi (dry, yuck). Tried some food from the Mediterranean section. Hummus, dates, lamb, naan bread, olives, etc. Okay, but not great, I've had better Greek food elsewhere.

Mexican, American, and meat carving areas did not interest me, although my Father-In-Law got a nice looking piece of prime rib. My husband also got some fried chicken that he said was quite tasty.

Desserts - Mainly their dessert section is cupcakes, although I did manage to find some pretty decent cannolis. The cupcake I had was OK, but kind of dry. I honestly don't even remember which kind it was now, but if you have a thing for cupcakes you will love this place.

The food was super disappointing. We went in thinking we'd have a good breakfast, lots of options to choose from, and leave feeling happy and full. 

Instead, the food was marginal, overcooked and dry. There really wasn't much variety, which was sad, considering they have so many stations promising things like ""Asian"" or ""Mexican"" or ""Italian"". It was pretty much the same thing at each stop, with a few variations.

On my first pass - still nursing some high hopes - I grabbed an Andouille Sausage corn cake, a breakfast quiche, a scoop of hash browns, an Egg Benedict half and some scrambled eggs.

The corn cake was hard and dry, and if there was Andouille sausage in there, it was hiding from me. The breakfast quiche was so dry I couldn't even swallow the tiny bite I took. It was seriously like the Sahara Desert inside that thing. The Egg Benedict was - predictably - overcooked, though that's on me for grabbing an Egg Benedict from a steam table. If the egg was poached when it was set out, all that time above the steam and under the lights just kept right on cooking it.

The eggs and the hash browns were the best things I had that day. Both were buttery and tasty, without being too greasy. Score.

My second pass - hopes understandably diminished, but wanting to get the most out of the buffet prices - was forgettable. I tried some sautéed fruits (peaches and apples), as well as a scoop of cheesy grits and one of the pastries from the sad dessert station, but nothing blew me away.

The best thing about the morning was our waitress, Nina. She had the best personality! She joked with us, made us girls feel special, and made sure to get us what we were asking for. She then made my husband and I feel super special for having participated in the half marathon the day before, even though we weren't feeling extra special at that point. 

I wish everybody had a good, friendly, open attitude like Nina did. She's definitely the best thing we experienced at Spice Market, and I hope they appreciate her there!",0,0,0

Stayed at the Planet Hollywood for the first time so that I can walk around the strip instead of taking my car to everywhere I go. I guess it was really convenientonly because of where this hotel was situated. Rooms were pretty crappy too and so was the buffet.

Spice market buffet? Please stay away. I dont know exactly how much they charge for dinner but probably around less or more than $30 for sure. So not worth your money. All the selections they had out was just so horrible. This is probably worst buffet I have ever been to including the local buffets in town, for instance, Chinese buffets.

Crab legs they had, had no flavor whatsoever. It was hard to eat as well. Most of the food selections were all americanized or just american food even though it says it is Italian and Asian. Why do they even need to have different sections because its unnecessary.

Prime rib was dry and stiff as ever. The mussels and clams I had was so dry that it was so chewy I couldnt even eat them. Not to mention, the lady server was pretty rude as well. I asked for extra silverware and she just gave me this nonchalant look and walked away without saying anything and came back when? like 1000000 minutes later. I did not want to leave tips at all. Only thing that was good here was my iced tea. That's it. No kidding.

Anyway, to make things short, you wont get your money's worth here at all. Please stay away. Just dont even bother to buy the Buffet of Buffets pass. Just pay one time fee to the Bacchanal buffet. They are probably the best buffet in the vegas and you wont be  sorry.",8,3,0

My wife took full advantage and probably had about 5 pounds of them. The melted butter for them cools fast, and becomes a gelatin, which wasn't too appealing, but unless you're eating them for over a half hour(I won't mention my wife again) that should be an issue. I like the food quality, and freshness. The cleanliness is great and a large factor in the 4 star rating as well. Service was hit and miss.

We arrived around 5:45 pm for an early dinner (we had a really early lunch and so we were hungry) and did not have wait in line. But as time passed, the line started to get pretty long (so come early if you don't want to wait... no one wants to be around a hangry person). 

Anyways, when I saw the overall rating for this place on yelp (3 stars at the time of this review), I wasn't expecting much but decided to purchase the Travelzoo deal anyway to save some money while on our weekend getaway. Well to my surprise, the food was actually pretty good (4 stars worthy for this review). 

Just like most of the other buffets in Las Vegas, there are different stations to choose from (Seafood, Soup, Salad, Mexican, Dessert, Chinese, Mediterranean, American). In the seafood section, you will find shrimp, snow crab legs and muscles. Unfortunately on the opposite side of the seafood section of the buffet is nearly empty (Mediterranean, 2nd soup station, 2nd salad station & Mexican stations are located on this side). But it is nice that there is less of a line on this side of the buffet and I really enjoyed the food items from both the Mediterranean and Mexican station. Also there was more selection to choose from in the salad station on this side (but of course I know most people are not thinking healthy greens and vegetables when at a buffet, especially one in Vega$). 

I least liked some of the offering at the American station. Here you will find a carving station (where I got lamb, but wasn't too happy with a big thing of fat... most of my meat was just fat... gross!), sliders (chicken and beef) and so forth. The chicken slider was not quite flavorful at all. The bun was really hard and the chicken was one of those mini breaded buffalo chicken patties (tasted like something that was frozen and reheated). The beef slider wasn't good either. 

I loved the dessert station (right in the middle of the the buffet). They actually have blue cotton candy that you can have, which was quite fun and light to eat (also makes great for photos). There are so many sweet choices of desserts, unlike other buffets I have been to along the strip that didn't have as many great choices. You can get cupcakes, flan, cake slices, tarts, crepes made to order, etc (there was also one macaron cookie available) and make your own ice cream sundae area as well. 

Although the food offered here isn't the best on the strip, it is still pretty good (especially at the price for what we paid.. by the way, after the voucher, we still had to paid an additional $3.16 for the tax) and wouldn't mind coming here again in the distant future (it's Vegas, I know I will be back soon).",21,3,3

Dude.. but we just had a sandwich from Earl's like.... an hour and a half ago...

So we dove right in and ate as much crab legs as we wished.

I like how they're half cracked already.. so it's semi effortless to just get the crab meat and dunk it in butter.

The salad bar--if you're into it does not have a lot of 'toppings'.. however i did like the tomato salad for some reason because of huge mozza balls.

(I honestly was just too overwhelmed with all our meals; all i wanted was a salad at that time... and i couldn't pass on crabs of course)....

I went around lunch time so the line was about 40 minutes. Terribly confusing how they got the line..because the buffet is downstairs and when you walk to the escalator you see a rope across it, so meaning wait for someone. So I did and gazed at the menu for a bit. 
An employee standing a few feet away by the tables asked a few people who were behind me if we all were going to the buffet and pointed a line behind a pillar. 
No sign telling you where a line was and everyone was concealment behind a huge pillar in the casino. I am not a tourist, so I do read signs, but if they don't have none for me to read then it's their fault. So several people got in front of me as I walked around the rope and shook my head. 

So waiting there among about 10 people in front of me, so I was thinking it wasn't that bad. We waited for about 15 minutes and then a gentleman opened the rope and let us all through. Once downstairs you see the true line. 
After I get to the cashier they include another line for waiting for the host to seat you. The lines are really bound together, so the people wanting to see the cashier are bunched in with the people ready to be seated. I feel sorry for the employees there because they have a hell of a job with all these people.

It's like a right of passage along with drinking all day long and partying all night long. Essentially chose this one because it was conveniently located where we were staying = lazy hungry girls go to the closest place. 

What you ought to do is snag some 10% coupons they hand out for this place. It's not exactly super cheap but I think the whole ""all-you-can-eat"" aspect and the large amount of choices make it a solid choice. We actually made it our one of two meals that day so it averages out in terms of price. 

On to the food. They have a kind of ""world"" theme going with selections from ""Italy"" ""Asia"" ""Middle East"" and ""Mexico"" along with standard seafood and American stuff. Clearly it's  nothing super authentic  but you have a lot of options. Desserts are really diverse from tarts to soft serve to cotton candy (probably a huge hit with kids)!

My favorites: shrimp cocktail, mashed potatoes, all the fruit (very fresh), BACON, lobster pasta, crab salad,  bbq pork buns, and the prime rib. Things that were not so good: The guacamole was pretty gross. It was brownish and way too lemon-y tasting and actually most things from the Mexican area were just not good at all. Scrambled eggs were a little runny that day and I think the pizza tastes like something from an elementary school cafeteria. Of course this is all my opinion, I certainly didn't try everything (though I put in a good effort) and they have a lot of variety that is sure to please every palate. I think I was most impressed with the Middle Eastern section which was surprisingly good and certainly unusual at a buffet. ""Italian"" stuff is mostly pasta and pizza, don't expect anything fancy. 

You will stuff your face here and they are pretty nice about letting you hang around for a couple of hours while you eat, rest, and then eat some more.

The prime rib is not the same quality of cut that you experience at Paris or Bellagio. It might be the way it's cooked because it is dry and au jus is a must. Some of the Asian counter foods sit out for too long that it doesn't look as appetizing.

The baked potato stand is not bad as you can customize your stuffed potato to your liking.

I later picked up some roasted turkey, some chicken, some Naan bread, beans and rice, quesadilla.  I had some Mac & Cheese as well but wasn't happy with it at all, it didn't taste right or good.

Got into vegas late and was hungry, So checked in real quick at the Luxor and headed to PH to eat. My impression of the Buffet of Buffets is could go to the participating buffets, pay and get a card or wrist band. Was told rudely or bothered by an older filipino lady that I had to go up this way and turn that way to get a rewards card to eat there for the deal. All she did was get me lost cause she lead me know where. This security guy helped me find where i was suppose to go in the end, alot easier. So took care of that, went back down, paid and got our table. 

I 1st tried the Seafood Station. The fish was pretty good. They had cajun tilapia, crab stuffed sole, panko battered shrimp and beer battered fish. They all had alot of flavor. There so called Paella was dry and lacked taste. Joe's Crab Shacks version is 10x better. 

They had meat, cheese and cracker Station, Mexican and American station but none of it caught my attention.

The one that did was the Middle Eastern Station. They had kabobs of Tandoori chicken, Beef and Vegetables, Hummus, Babaganoosh, Naan bread and ""AWESOME"" Candied Figs. Couldnt get enough of them and everything else they had to offer. The guy knew what i wanted since i kept going back alot. lolll

The Desserts......ummmmm sucked. Only thing that tasted good was the Cotton Candy. It would be pretty hard to mess that up lolll

You wait in line for about an hour, go through a shimmering archway, down an escalator to. .  HOLY #$@$ is that another line?!?!? Fortunately for you it's only an extra 20 minutes. Plenty of time to release the inner child by playing patty cake, reliving sports punishment exercises, and ad libing the music videos running on the tvs which for some reason do NOT match the songs in the restaurant. But enough about the wait. . .

The Food-
LIKE- the Spice Market has HOT crab legs. They even offered Snow crab and Alaskan King Crab when I went. (most other buffets only offer one type, and it's served cold) 
LIKE- their dessert includes a crepe bar, and COTTON CANDY!!! perfect for cotton candy moustaches, followed by cotton candy paper cone unicorn pictures
LIKE- unlike most other buffets, they keep things simple, but in doing so, they manage to season the food more perfectly than most other buffets. 
DISLIKE- the lack of selection is a little off putting. If you have a group of picky eaters, and you are looking at paying more than $20 for this experience, there is a good bet that unless you are planning to eat $20 worth of salad and desserts, you might not get your monies worth. 

The Service-
WOW!!!! The only Las Vegas buffet that I have been to where the service was stellar and the servers actually, at a buffet deserved a 20% tip. We didn't have to ask for anything twice, and quite often, we wouldn't have to ask at all for anything! The most off putting thing about buffets is that used plates pile up on tables, but not here.

For $45 my boyfriend and I could eat at the buffet AND get unlimited drinks (alcohol included, OH YEAH!). Since our stomachs were empty and the deal was the right price, we decided to go for it. 

Upon arriving, we had to wait in line for about 25 minutes or so. It was about standard for any Vegas buffet. While in line, our mouths were watering as we read the different summer time options they had on the board.

Sadly, this place proved to be like majority of the buffets I decide to try on the strip that are not Bacchanal or Wicked Spoon. The food selection was decent, but half of it just did not look appealing. The kabobs looked a little charred and burnt, the pasta had an off taste to it..it just wasn't what I was expecting.

The only thing saving and adding an extra star to this place would have to be the crab legs. The crab legs they have contain a lot more meat then the crab legs at other places. By the end of the night, I was content with just eating those.

Would I come here again? Probably not, unless I was craving nothing but crab. In my opinion, save your money and go somewhere better.",3,0,3

We showed up Sunday morning @ 10:00. The wait was brief, friendly service and clean dining area. The waitress was hysterical! She sounded fresh of the boat from Texas and was a great server--keeping us topped off on drinks and keeping the table cleared of stacked dishes. 

Buffet food is always suspect for quality meat and items. This place uses a god quality distributor and had toast prime rib to be sliced along with the typical ham and turkey breast. I was excited to try a bite of this and a bite of that. The East Indian cuisine was delightful. The curry wasn't too hot but rich & spicy. Lots of tasty treats, fresh hummus as well.

Buffets are usually my time to get creative with what is available to me. The Spice Market Buffet looked especially fun since it featured your basic global cuisines.

At the salad bar I stocked up on grilled bell peppers, asparagus, brussel sprouts, olives, and other veggies that were not very memorable. Next I perused the Mexican food bar in hopes to top certain veggies with guacamole. Unfortunately, the guacamole looked sad, grey, and machine processed.

The Mid-Eastern bar looked much more promising while I filled my plate with hummus, dolmas, tabouli, pita, and if I remember correctly, some kinda of zucchini dish.

Overall, I was glad that there was a sufficient amount of options for me. However, all of it tasted as if these options were after thoughts. Nothing very exciting here. To top it off, the staff all had this ""FML"" attitude about themselves. From the cashiers to the hostess to the servers. Geez, get a better job if you all hate it so much.

It was a bit more than $30\/ person, which was okay, but we would definitely recommending investing a little more and going somewhere else for a different buffet.

We went on Saturday night around 5:30pm, rushing downstairs, thinking there'd be a huge line (we remember those 2+ hour waits at other buffets with our families) but there was a hardly a line. We waited probably 15 minutes before getting seated, which wasn't bad since we also wanted to catch the Saints & Broncos game.

For seafood, there was snow crab, not Alaskan king crab. The shrimp tasted very dry and tough. The meat selection was decent. I didn't bother trying the Asian food, Middle Eastern or the Mexican food, because the food was pretty mediocre. There was no sashimi or sushi selection. The boyfriend tried the Middle Eastern food, but he didn't think too highly of it either. The dessert selection is sort of small, but they do have cotton candy (I've never seen that at a buffet!)

They do have a $12\/ person all you can drink deal, but we ended up not doing that because we wanted to save our stomachs for the food. We didn't even stay too long since it was just okay and I didn't feel the need to stuff my face with mediocre food.

the Spice Market Buffet always has a warm spot in my heart because of their brunch. How can you not love made to order OMELETS??? They have the typical omelet items... ham, onions, mushrooms, green onions, cheese... but you want to know the secret? 

Here's the secret: go get a slice of the prime rib... chop it up yourself... then bring the plate w\/ your chopped primed rib to the station and have (ARGUABLY) the best omelet experience of your life... haha, CLEVER, eh?!

Come for Champagne Brunch and get your grub on w\/ some mimosas, how can you complain when you can eat and drink?!! WINNER WINNER, CHICKEN DINNER (in this case, chicken brunch).

Great place to go, would get 5\/5 but that's more reserved for the M-Buffet where you can get everything I just listed for about half the price on a weekday.  But the M's 9 miles away if you're on the strip, so convenience garners a strong review--well done SPICE MARKET.

Food:  This buffet boasts a modest selection of food choices for lunch:  Salad, Mexican, Soup, Middle Eastern and Desserts. I tried a kale salad, which was a mix of greens, olives, tomatoes, red onions and feta cheese. Not bad at all. From the ""Mexican"" selection, I chose a cheese quesadilla, which I figured would be relatively safe; wrong. The cheese inside was charred and made it difficult to cut with a knife and fork. From the ""Middle Eastern"" selection, I chose the rice pilaf and roast turkey. Sidenote: there was a father in line ahead of me with his young daughter. She decided she did not like the cut of turkey that have been provided to her and so her dad requested another slice. The chef then took the slice that was originally provided to her OFF OF HER PLATE and put it back on the carving board. He attempted to provide it to me, and I promptly refused it.

We arrived at 11:30, too late for breakfast, but just in time for lunch. There was only one couple in front of us, so we waited maybe a total of five minutes to ""check in"" and be seated. 

Now that I'm thinking about it, compared to the other buffets, the interior of this one looked like a hospital cafeteria. Kinda drab, neutral gray and blue colors all around. 

I tried the chicken marsala, but it lacked flavor. It didn't even really taste like a real marsala sauce. All I tasted was chicken. I like chicken, but if you're going to say that it's ""chicken marsala"" make sure that's really what the sauce is. I made the same comment to my boyfriend and he said ""I know, but I didn't want to tell you to disappoint you"". If he's saying there's no flavor...then that's a bad sign. 

I do agree with the other reviews though, the shrimp tempura was my favorite part of the buffet. I would go back just for the unlimited amount of it. People obviously liked it as well, since there was a line waiting when they were refilling them.

The good: 

They had scored snow crab legs so you could just slide the legs off the meat. The dessert section had a ton of selections, although I couldn't get a fruit tart because I didn't want to contort myself under the glass overhang to reach the tarts all the way at the back of the counter. The prime rib was good. The spring rolls in the Asian section were delicious.

I also liked that the buffet was separated from the main casino. You go down an escalator to a lower level, so you don't have to smell the smoke that seems to permeate all Vegas casinos.

The not-so-good: 

Their salad section is really sad. On one side, I saw heads of iceberg lettuce chopped into quarters. That was literally all they had for salad. I found another salad section on the other side and got excited before seeing that the salad toppings were extremely limited. All they had was cheese, mushrooms, and croutons. No peas, no chopped ham, no bacon bits, no chopped eggs, nothing. I can make a better salad at Golden Corral. 

There were really only five options in each section. No spaghetti in the Italian section, and the lasagna had one layer of noodle on the bottom, a chunk of ground beef in the middle, and another layer of noodle on top with some marinara sauce. I was disappointed. 

I am not a picky eater and we went to this buffet with kids, so I wasn't expecting gourmet food. I think the horrible salad section and the lack of decent Italian food was just too much for me.",1,0,0

I like the variety but the decor and the lighting in this place are not so good. It's so freaking dark and plain in here. 

Here are the food highlights and lowlights:

Highlights:

- Both hot steamed and cold steamed King crab legs (my husband loves hot crab legs, so he was thrilled to have this option) that are halved for you to not have to crack yourself
- Middle Eastern section -- delicious, but the ground lamb-stuffed tomatoes were in dire need of seasoning
- Delicious chocolate and raspberry mousse-y and wafer-y layer cake
- A lot of variety and range
- Delicious rolls
- Crab salad
- Freshly spun cotton-candy

Lowlights:

- No good soup
- Customer service is lacking -- it took a long time for our server to check on us, grab our plates, and refill drinks

Bottom line: We'll come back for sure! I think we just caught them in the middle of a dinner rush!",0,0,0

It's like one of the cheapest (quality and taste wise) buffet that i had in vegas. Total was $60 sth for 2 for that quality of food? It's not comparable to any other hotel buffets for that same price. 

The quality of the food is just bleh. Everything from decor to presentation to taste is just very whatever. My usual favorite part of the buffet - dessert section just completely turned me down. C'mon..soft served ice cream??? (not even comparable to souplantations soft served). It's more like hometown buffet quality but hometown is 3 times less the price. 

Ahh. Despite the desserts, other food was just not to my taste. It's true that there are a little bit of everything, from american to italian, asian, middleeastern, mexican, etc, but nothing was really that good. Probably the best thing that i had was a piece of prime rib that i got when we first sat down. When i went to get another piece later on, they already got a new chunk of meat, and that second piece was complete RAW, dripping blood.

On my last visit, service was impeccable. Our server (Aman? Amman? Not sure) was super quick clearing the table and getting drink refills. 
Honestly though if you've never been to a Vegas buffet, Bacchanal would be the place to go - not this. 
Spice Market is where I go when: 1) we have a big group and everyone wants something different, 2) I'm already staying at Planet Hollywood, 3) I want to eat on the Strip without spending big bucks at those celebrity chefs' restaurants. 
They have Groupon from time to time - breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner for two people with unlimited drinks. Obviously if you go for dinner you get the most bang for your buck since you pay the same amount for the Groupon.

And it was really good!  If you are a local and show your id they give you like 10% off, but it's still kind of pricey at $25+ for breakfast.

The had a different sections of foods, typical of most buffets. I will have to agree with another writer,  I stayed away from the Asian\/Chinese nothing looked too amazing there. I killed the Mexican section, but I think I mentioned that already.

Eventually, I stopped trying the other foods and just ate a couple slices of the pizza to get full.  

There are much better buffets in Vegas. If you really have heart set on a buffet, I'd recommend the buffets at Caesar's Palace, Aria, Paris Las Vegas, or the Bellagio. You'll pay about 10-20 dollars more, but it's well worth it. If you absolutely want to eat at Planet Hollywood, then I'd suggest going to Gordon Ramsay Burgr.

The Spice Market Buffet is located inside Planet Hollywood Hotel and runs anywhere from $30-35 depending on Lunch\/Dinner, we went here on a Sunday and the dinner price was the same lunch $32....You can also pay a little extra and do the 24 hour buffet for like $45-50 and you can come back to this buffet or go to any of the participating 24\/7 Buffet locations listed when you buy this offer.

So why do they call this the Spice Market Buffet?
- they try to make it an International food affair by having separate buffet areas from Mexican, Italian, Chinese, Middle Eastern, American, etc...


Best Entrees
- Crab Legs (really good Alaskan legs)
- Beef Burger (it was surprisingly good)
- Middle Eastern (dolmas, dips, and naan)
- Tandoori Kabobs (fresh out of the oven every 15mins)
- Prime Rib (served by Chef includes dipping sauces)
- Lamb Cuts (really juicy)


Stay Away From Me
- All the American Food (expect for the burger)
- Mexican Food (so bland made taco bell look like Maggiano's)
- Asian Ribs (the smell from the sauce made me want to vomit)
- Crepe (no effort, was eating raw dough)


Best Desserts (awesome selection of cakes)
- Banana Cream Pie
- White Chip Macadamia Cookie
- Pecan Pie

My boyfriend and I came across a Groupon for Spice Market and decided to purchase the buffet option. For $43, two people get all-you-can-eat-and-drink (including beer, wine and champagne) brunch. There are also breakfast and lunch options for weekdays but the dinner choice is currently sold out.

I'm giving Spice Market four stars based on the alcohol (bottomless mimosas...hell yea!) and the incredible dessert station. The rest of the buffet was decent but probably three stars at best. 

Things I loved: 

The cupcake selection was phenomenal! There must have been about 12 different varieties of fancy cupcakes. I tried four (cookies and cream, chocolate mint, caramel apple and smores) and, like a little piggy, almost ate all of those four cupcakes. My personal favorite was the chocolate mint (super creamy mint frosting) but all four of them were incredible. If only I had more room in my belly!

The prime rib was great! Perfectly cooked and tasted like perfection when dipped in the au jus. I enjoyed two slices of the tender meat.

The mac and cheese was surprisingly good. I've tried it at other buffets and always find it to be bland but here is was perfectly seasoned and I even went back for seconds. The chicken pesto pasta from the Italian bar was also a tasty dish.

Things I Didn't Love:

The fresh-sliced turkey was dry and the gravy had a funny taste to it. I love turkey and gravy so this was big disappointment.

The salad bar was very tiny. I know that not a lot of people go for salad at a buffet but I always like a little salad to go with my meal. I guess it makes me feel slightly healthier while gorging on all the deliciousness. But there were very few toppings and the ranch was not to my liking (I'm very particular about the ranch dressing at restaurants). 

The mashed potatoes, which I admit that I didn't even try, looked incredibly runny and strangely yellow. What happened to fluffy white potatoes? 

One other quick note, if you have a group of 8 or more, they charge you a mandatory 18% gratuity. We, of course, had exactly eight people. I think this is crap as it is a buffet and they're not really doing much for us aside from pushing a couple tables together. And if we had seven instead of eight, they wouldn't charge us?

We stopped in one morning for breakfast because we'd read lots of good reviews about it...and let's just say we were seriously disappointed. And glad we used those coupons so we didn't pay full price for it!

Everything - and I mean EVERYTHING - was cold!! Our first go around we loaded up with eggs, hash browns, bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, etc. and not one single thing was hot. Not even warm. Cold. That is not the experience you expect when going to a buffet. We left most of that food on our plates and made a second trip to see if maybe we just needed to stir things around or pick from the bottom of the trays, try getting things from a different area - but arrived back at our table to find the second round cold as well. Boo!

Highly disappointing experience, since everything tasted good - those biscuits and gravy would have been a delight - but who wants to eat cold eggs and meat for breakfast? Which left us wondering too how safe the food was if it isn't kept at a proper temperature!

Majority of the offerings are much unchanged since that time.  We had dinner here 1\/16\/13. It was peak hour and long line, so we opted to pay the $10 or $12 line pass. Paying for line pass not relevant to number of stars given in review. Shrimp weren't that tasty. Most of the other foods were only fair.  Middle Eastern section has lamb kabobs that are good.  Got three of them first time through.  Went back for more and there were none.  Also no skewered chicken or vegetables.  They were cooking, but I was told would have to wait at least 5 minutes.  That to me was outrageous.  I remember their dessert table, while not all that extravagant, used to have selection and was tasty.  Used to have amazing fruit tarts -- always. Now,desserts consist of just minimal selection (including crepes that were premade and stacked up like 50 little frisbies) of nothing worthwhile and an abundance of cup cakes. Yes there were many different kinds of cup cakes, some good, some bad, but essentially the entire dessert bar consisted of cup cakes. Apparently they think having just cup cakes is a lot better of an idea than their patrons do.

Went for breakfast next morning (stayed at PH and had 24 hr. buffet pass). At breakfast, I saw staff taking fruit tarts off baking trays. I was told they were for lunch. When I mentioned I love them and was looking for them at dinner previous night, I was told they should have been put out.  That person told me dinner staff was lazy and that's the only reason they weren't out. They then offered me as many as I wanted. 

I will stay at PH again and go to Spice Market for breakfast as it's convenient and okay for that meal. Although if I weren't staying at PH I would skip breakfast too.  I will not give it another try for dinner.  Dinner buftet I'll save for Bacchanal at Caesar's or Wicked Spoon at Cosmopolitan.",0,0,0

What I really liked about this particular buffet is that they have clearly defined cuisines at each station.  There was Mexican, Mid-Eastern, Italian, American, and Asian.  Now I know they have those food selections at most buffets, but because they were self contained islands of food, they were all well stocked with a variety of foods true to their region of the world.  

We didn't over-eat at this one (I know, what a shame!), but of the food I tried I was pleasantly surprised.  The standout selection for me was the Prime Rib, which is typically something I pass on at buffets (sorry, a slice of Prime Rib can take up a lot of valuable real estate in my stomach), but at the advice of my friend I went for a slice.  

The Prime Rib here was slow roasted and cooked perfectly.  It was so tender it nearly melts in your mouth.

My favorites at the Spice Market Buffet included the Alaskan Crab legs, the Prime Rib, the boned Short Rib, the Beef Kabob. As you can tell, I love meat. Any meat that was served at this buffet was well prepared because after a week, I can still taste the juiciness of the Prime Rib. I am also a big fan of the Desserts of this buffet.

A few minutes passed before those people were seated by a woman who never returned, and then we proceeded to wait...and wait....and wait some more.

He just kept saying the large open area of seating was ""closed"" (for no apparent reason) and that they couldn't find Joy, the lady who usually seats people. He nodded along to our complaints and said he would ""tell Joy."" How about you tell management that Joy is not doing her job?

The buffet itself is average. The sushi was bad and so was the ""Italian"" food. Their only strong suit is the dessert bar--it's full of tons of cupcake flavors, ice cream and cotton candy. 

I'd never been to Planet Hollywood before, and this is absolutely my last time at their buffet and casino. Don't waste your money on mediocre food and TERRIBLE service.",0,0,0

Food choices were pretty good and plentiful. Since I have only been to less than a handful of buffets in Vegas, I really did like the different sections from around the world.

The crab and shrimp cocktail were very good. Also I really liked the salad wedgie with bacon and blue cheese dressing. Thought it was a bit silly to just put 1 fried chicken breast into a basket though. Maybe add fries or something to it. My partner seemed to enjoy the Mediterranean section. The cupcakes were nice and all and many types to choose from but were very very dry and a bit tasteless. I ended up just eating the frosting tops off just to taste the flavor of each one I tried.

Thanks goodness for the discount.  Because if I had paid full price then a 1 star review would be more appropriate.  Spice Market is overhyped, apparently.  There's NO WAY that this buffet is anywhere near the same league as the other two we tried.

At Bacchanal they had four salads I tried that were all excellent.  I could have have enjoyed any one of them as a meal.  At Spice Market there was basically a bowl of greens and a few bowls of vegetables so you could make your own salad, like you would at Sizzler, oooh, fancy.... not really.  

At the better two buffets they had Gelato, they even had Sugar-Free Chocolate Gelato at Wicked Spoon, and it was excellent.  At Spice Market they had soft serve ice cream... which isn't even really ice cream it's basically cold, artificially flavored vegetable oil like what you'd get at McD's.  Disgusting and not worth messing your diet up for. 

The carvers at Spice Market were rude and condescending.  You had to wait in line for a HALF a piece of chicken.  If you tried to serve yourself you got yelled at, WTF?  The seafood, which I didn't try smelled really strong, like week old shrimp.  My eyes started to water in fact when they nearly seated us near the seafood station and I asked to be moved.

They had a Middle Eastern food section.  They had Lamb on the skewer and off the skewer.  Off the skewer looked older and possibly recycled.  My wife and I each got some, but it was too rubbery to be chewed.  One of the chicken dishes I tried was too dry to choke down, some of the grilled squash was tasteless, while the grilled zucchini in the salad bar was decent.  

At Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon EVERYTHING was cooked perfectly.  The grilled chicken breast was so juicy I even went back for a second serving!  The Peking duck had crispy skin... Truly talented chefs.  Not correspondence cooking school dropouts. 

In the Asian section there were two odd looking dishes they called Chef's specials.  Couldn't even tell us what kind of animal it was or how they cooked it?  I suspect we were being experimented on.  

My overall impression was that this is a buffet where you can get a coupon and save some money, then pretend you're eating the same thing you'd get if you weren't so concerned about saving money.  We had a limited time in Vegas, only got to hit three buffets (three tours & four shows).  This place was a waste of time, left me unsatisfied and feeling gross.  I ended up throwing out a lot the food that I wanted to enjoy, but the quality and the skill of the cooks just wasn't up to standard.  

Do yourself a favor and don't go.  The other two I recommend highly if you have the few extra bucks.  Maybe a little less drinking or gambling?  I assume you have SOME disposable income coming to Vegas and reading buffet reviews.  Want to enjoy the meal of a lifetime?  It won't be done here.",0,0,0

This is one of the WORST buffets that I have been to in my entire life, and living in Las Vegas for 24 years has definitely given me experience with buffets.

It was about $40 for two people at lunch. The food was horrendous for the most part, with the exception of a handful of dishes. It was unclear whether we had a waitress after we received our first drinks because she disappeared. 

We would have been better off going to the Rio Buffet not only for the awesome local discount, but also because the food is A MILLION (no exaggeration) times better there than at the Spice Market Buffet.

They are also not honoring the coupon in the 2017 Las Vegas Advisor coupon book, which seems really lousy to me. I know they lowered the price, but that was undoubtedly because they lowered the size of the buffet. If they would have changed their policy in 2018, that would have been fine-- but the Spice Market Buffet was part of why I bought two Advisor books this year. I am thoroughly disgusted.

My boyfriend is in town, and he wanted to do the Buffet of Buffets.  We timed it so that we would have dinner, breakfast, lunch (for him, while I'm at work) and dinner. 

We had dinner on a Thursday night, around 9pm.  I was so happy they had three of my favorite things in the world: tabbouleh, hummus and creme brulee.  I make better tabbouleh, I also make better hummus, and I could taste the butane on the creme bruee.  So, I went back and got a cookie instead.  They had naan bread which was delicious.  I ate it without the hummus because I didn't care for the hummus.  I had some mac and cheese, which looked really good, but didn't live up to appearances. I also tried a beef slider.  I took it out of the bun, because it was just too hard...and I don't think it was supposed to be.  I tried to eat just the patty, but it tasted like Burger King.  When all was said and done, my ""dinner"" consisted of: 2 pieces of pineapple, cookie, a piece of naan bread and a glass of water.

We went back Friday morning for breakfast.  I got yogurt, baked oatmeal with peaches, a blueberry blintz , and a slice of french toast.  Unsurprisingly, the yogurt was good, the oatmeal was actually really good, but would have been better if it were less dry.  I just put it in my yogurt.  The french toast was pretty good, but by now, I was pretty full.  I  had a bite of the blintz, it was okay.  I have a rule, that if I'm going to eat sweets or carbs, they must be outstanding to be worth it. 


To be fair, I never expect much from a buffet.  I also don't go to them anymore, really, because while quality has gone down, prices have gone way up.  You only save $1 with a players card, and there is no locals discount.

This Spice Market buffet is located on the lower floor of the Casino. The buffet itself is pretty big with buffet stations going from one end of the buffet to the other end. It's comparable to Rio Buffet, but I would still consider Rio buffet the biggest and the longest.

They have a lot of food to choose from, but I do have to say that most of the food didn't taste spectacular. It was alright. Nothing to rave about.

The dessert station wasn't that great! Majority are cupcake items. They also have made to order crepe, but the crepe was already cooked. They just have to warm it up.

Overall, the service was good, but I would have to say that this buffet has more quantity over quality.

TIP: Dine between 2:45 and 3:30 and pay lunch price, so that way you can enjoy dinner food items starting at 3:30. For example, snow crab legs. By the way, the crab legs doesn't taste good. Just alright.

The food quality is average at best and while they have a variety of international stations, the offerings are very basic.   I normally clean my plate and leave little waste, however I barely ate half of the foods that I selected. Additionally the service is poor - none of their workers from the cashiers, to the waitstaff, to the line cooks seem to care about the customers. They barely go thru the motions and are very slow.  An example is i grabbed a creme brûlée (which wasn't very good) for dessert and I asked the attendant at the dessert area for a spoon as they only provide a fork and knife at the table. She told me they were by the soft serve ice cream machine., but there were none. I told the attendant and she told me to go to the soup area. The soup area also was out. Ended up tying to eat dessert with a fork.

So delish and you can get whatever you want on them. Down the way they have the normal buffet food, rib eye, mexican, italian, chinese, nothing that stood out. 

I was disappointed when I didnt see crab legs!! I crave for crab legs in any buffet! The seafood section wasnt to grand. Although they have serve tempura shrimp steaming hot out of the fryer. The cocktail shrimp was good and they come already peeled and.

The DESSERT! They had everything from soft served ice cream, cotton candy, flan, bread pudding, red velvet cake, carrot cake, chocolate cake, tarts etc!! They have made to order crepes ( but the crepes are pre made and not freshly cooked!!)

The wait is not the long compared to other buffets food is good and the waiters are so friendly! Highly recommend to try the middle eastern food and dessert section!",1,0,0

I think it is well worth the wait though, because the stations have so many options. The crab, fish and chips, american station, Mediterranean and dessert station were the highlights for me.

The food quality was better than expected from some of the Yelp reviews. There were certainly things I got that l didn't like, but there were many, many things that looked good that I just didn't have room for. 

The crab legs were pre-cracked so it was crazy easy to get out a ton of fresh crab meat. I wish I'd loaded up on more of these my first time around, as the secret had gotten out and increased the line size quite a bit after that.

Aside from that, my favorites were the crab salad (tasted like real crab again), the veggie spring rolls, spicy tuna and california sushi rolls, and cajun crawfish pasta. The poor Mexican station is to the far right and got next to no traffic, which was apparent not only from afar but from up close seeing how the food looked like it had been sitting there a while. I took a chance on the veggie tamales, though, and they did not disappoint.

Tons of dessert options, mostly in the small tart\/cupcake variety. Cotton candy was gross. Red velvet cupcake was on point. They would make you a crepe with blueberries\/strawberries\/bananas and a chocolate sauce. They were small and really runny-- made in a skillet pre-made and not very well done.

Honestly, the only reason I don't give it that fifth star is two things: lack of higher quality meat\/sushi that was listed, making it worth $31 each (I saw no steaks at all, just lamb at the Mediterranean station, and only 2 basic sushi roll options) and the wait\/line process. Waited for at a minimum 25 minutes (and we were only about the 15th party in line) to pay up front for the buffet, then another 15 minimum for a secondary line to hand a greeter our receipt and have her show us a table. No reason both of these lines couldn't move more quickly. Plenty of space in the restaurant and unnecessary bottlenecking.",3,0,1

Or maybe amazing if you see someone like me eat that much. The buffet food was okay, the crabs had no flavor though, so I make my own flavor sauce. I don't eat it with butter. I take a bunch of lemons and squeeze it out to make lemon juice and  then put some salt and pepper in the mix. That's all. Simple yet delicious. The prime rib was okay only when it wasn't well done.

That's pretty much the summation of my experience here.

I got this as part of the Buffet of Buffet packages, and since I hadn't tried this buffet yet on any of my previous 10 trips to Vegas, I thought I'd give it a go. The yelp reviews were somewhere in the middle, so I figured it couldn't be that bad. 

First, I went the mistake of going after the brunch portions were cleared away. Eggs, bacon, and the like are easy, filling foods that are hard to screw up, and without them there's a good chance that the other food will be not that great. I was right.

The salad bar items were not too bad, but the meat was kind of gross. Any of the chicken items I tried were tasteless breast meat with no flavor and a consistency of wet toilet paper. And I'm talking about stuff that was supposed to be coated in middle eastern\/Indian spices. NO taste. 

The service sucked--our waiter evidently went home after he brought my friend her drink (she was seated a few minutes before me), and NEVER came back. I had to wait until my meal was almost done before we could flag down another waitress just so I could get a drink to wash down the disappointment that was this meal. 

In the future, I'd give this one a miss, unless I was sure there were breakfast items available. Given that some of the food was passable, I have hopes that the breakfast items would make it worth the time. But other than that? No.",1,1,1

We went at lunch for the Groupon deal which included 37.98 for all you can drink for two with your two buffet entries. Even before we got there the price alone sold us. 

When we arrived we had a short wait in line, nothing too crazy. Were seated quickly and immediately hopped on the food line. Oh boy was I impressed with the selection. 

The middle eastern section was by far my favorite, and this is mainly because I've found it extremely hard to find a buffet that can pull it off correctly. But this is the one!
As far as the American food... Two must haves - Mac and Cheese, and their Au Gratin Garlic Potatoes...Wow, was I drooling right after our meal...

One thing that does annoy me about the Soup bars here in Vegas, its almost always Chicken noodle and Minestrone wherever we go. How about some Tomato Bisque or Broccoli Cheddar soup! Variety!

The only negative things I would say is that there service was decent. Nothing spectacular from our server but nothing terrible so it was slightly above average.  He could have been a bit better but was personal and didn't get behind even though they started getting busy. Even though gratuity was included with our deal, we still tipped....even though he was Patriots fan haha.

Reading review online, this was suppose to be one of the best buffets in Vegas.  It was decent, but not something to ride home about.

The theme is a world buffet, with different stations including Chinese, American, Mexican, Mediterranean and I think Japanese.  Though creative, each station only had a few dishes for each theme, which limitis the buffet.  

My husband complained that the crab legs were undercooked.  He was not impressed by their selection of seafood, however this is not a seafood buffet.  I had a roast pork that was very juicy, but nothing spectacular.

I've been here several times, but my recent visit to Vegas during the summer we did the 24 hour buffet pass for $45. Without it, price for regular brunch is $27.99 and dinner $29.99, but for $15 more you can visit one of several different local buffets as many times as you'd like in a 24 hour period. Definitely a good deal and worth it. 

The Spice Market buffet has one of the largest selections and the freshest food in town. I suggest you get here early (30min) to avoid the lunch and dinner rush. The buffet is set up in stations that represent different styles of cuisine. Great lineup of world foods that are sure to delight your taste buds and senses with offerings from the Middle East, Asian, Mexican, Japanese, and Italian. Plus your standard American buffet spread - prime ribs, ham, turkey, bbq beef ribs, roast chicken, etc. For seafood, the king crab legs, stuffed scallops, salmon and shrimp cocktails are delictable and tasty. The crabs come pre-cracked making it easy to pick through and cuts down on the time required to enjoy them. My favorite station is Middle Eastern grill station. Great grilled lamb, kabobs, and vegetables.

The dessert station is awesome here. Decadent choices of desserts like cream brulee, cotton candy, canoli, cup cakes, eclairs, fruit tarts and chocolate dipped strawberry. There is even a live cooking station for dessert where a chef will make you a hot bananas foster or a made-to-order crepe.

Atmosphere is nice and service was pretty decent. The server was friendly and would stop by regulary to re-fill our drinks. They have TV throughout the  restaurant perfect when watching the Lakers or sports game.

Overall - 3.5 star. I would recommend this place to anyone. Definitely a better choice over Harrahs or Paris buffet.

Cons - Finding the place can be difficult cause its located in lower level of the hotel. Make sure to follow the signs to escalator. Long lines during peak lunch and dinner hours. Pricey, but make sure to get 24hr pass for great deal.",5,2,2

Of all the buffet of buffet places, this was my favorite. Even though people say dessert is best at Casear's Lago and seafood is best at Rio, I think Spice Market beats them all. Even a few of the workers at Casear's told me that Spice Market is best. When were first go here, we had to walk in the back corner at the Seafood station for warm crab legs. Sadly the warm butter didn't taste that great... it didn't taste like butter at all. I also liked the tempura shrimp, some pieces had too thick batter. The roast sirloin was good, lamb kabobs were okay, some pieces were dry. The Middle Eastern section was a few people's favorite in my party. I honestly don't remember what I ate here other than warm crab legs, roast beef, sirloin and fruits. 

The desserts here are awesome though. Everyone liked the cotton candy and a they don't even care if you take it out. This place definitely has the best creme brulee.

Boy was I surprised - the lunch buffet there was exceptional.  

Particularly good was their ""American"" cuisine section.  I know, that sounds kind of lame, considering they advertise themselves as ""Spice Market"".  But the beef roast was great (I normally hate generic beef roasts for the masses - they are always bland, overcooked, and just disappointing - not this one), the breaded pork chop was something that true Southerners could be happy with, and they even had a made-to-order hamburger service. They also had Italian, Asian, Seafood, and Middle Eastern food as well, all of which had good dishes.  To top it off, the made to order crepes for dessert were fantastic.

Obviously not everything was exactly what I would have wanted - it is a buffet cooked for thousands of people, after all.  But far more of that food had me thinking ""I should go back for some more"" than at any other buffet I have been to... ever.

Someone told us this was cheaper and better than the Wynn Buffet. They must have been on crack. The food was so-so, I ended up eating apple-salmon and watermelon BUT I tried just about everything and ate nothing else, although I did have cotton candy.

The Serving Hostess' were extremely rude. There were 11 in our party (6 came up so they started to seat us, then the remaining 5, she starting raising her voice telling me I should have told her there were 11, then started to argue with me), they wanted to charge 18% gratuity to serve the ice tea (she didn't take our plates away without us telling her, and she didn't serve the drinks without us tracking her down). We split the party up to prevent paying the 18% and they put us at opposite ends of the dining area.

I'd rather go to one of the station casinos for a better and least expensive experience. Staff at Spice Market Buffet is rude and food was just okay. I went to the cashier to have a $100 dollar bill changed so that I could tip the waitress. While she was handling the money, I was talking to the Asst. F&B. When we left and were already home, I noticed that I only had $70 in cash after I gave our waitress her $10 tip. I immediately contacted the Asst. F&B letting him know that I was cashed out $20 short while I was talking to him. Until now, I haven't heard back from anyone at the restaurant yet. I know it was my mistake as well.

There was a long line, but the wait was only about 10-12 minutes. Ended up paying $27.99 since I had my player's card, but my friend ended up paying $30.00 since she didn't bring hers.

Anyway, I had a little bit of each cuisine, except the Mexican, since I accidentally spilled water all over it. Unfortunately, it would take me forever to nit-pick what was wrong with each dish, so I'm just going to be listing what I didn't like about each one here:

American:

Rag-out: mushrooms tasted like they were uncooked, sauce was flavorless
Macaroni & cheese: it didn't taste like cheese, or pasta; plus the cheese was sort of clear(eww!)

Mediterraenean:

Naan with mango chutney: Okay. The mango was a little too sweet for my liking, but it wasn't terrible.

Seafood:
king crab legs: these were going fast; not sure why though. They could have at least provided some melted butter so it wouldn't be so bland
clams: tasted like mussels; though that's not necessarily a bad thing

Italian:

3 cheese lasagna: similar to the type of lasagna you'd get at Sbarro. A-ok.

I didn't have any of the salads, but my friends said they were good. 

And now, for the desserts, which was the worst part of the meal:

Seafood:
king crab legs: these were going fast; 
clams: tasted like mussels; though that's not necessarily a bad thing

carrot cake: basically, they baked carrots into rye bread.
flan: weird, because the sauce was good, but flan itself was like flavorless jello. 
strawberry cheesecake: okay, so they decided not put any sugar in it. Oh, and they substituted some crumbly feta cheese for the cream cheese. Awful, just awful.
creme brulee: the top wasn't even glazed over and crunchy; you're supposed to crack the top of a creme brulee to eat it. The inside tasted very eggy, and the texture was just like pudding.
lemon meringue tart: Guess they decided to save money and just use the same filling for the creme brulee and the lemon meringues. 

Hands down the worst dining experience I have ever had in my life. Though I didn't try much of the Mediterranean cuisine, my friends said that and the salads were the only tasty parts of their meal. The only thing I liked about eating here was that they had cotton candy.",1,1,0

The only memorable thing that happened here was my friend telling me that he wanted me to go with him to the 24 hr marriage chapel to be the witness (and take pics) so he could get hitched with his girl that nite..  while I was trying to get some lamb chops..  it seemed kinda surreal at the moment.",3,2,3

After purchasing the buffet of buffets 24hr pass my friends and I decided to give the Spice Market a try. We came in at around 10:30AM, so we were lucky to have both breakfast and lunch entrees. 

The decor is simplistic, perhaps a bit too simplistic, especially for a popular hotel that is on the strip. The staff was adequate and the wait times weren't too long.

The food was average at best. There weren't any distinctive entrees. I expected some nice sandwiches, soups, salads, and breakfast specialties. Unfortunately there were no sandwiches but there was an adequate carving station that offered some decent prime rib. 

Overall the Spice Market Buffet is a bit of a let down, but considering the list of buffets to choose from the buffet of buffets, the Spice Market isn't that bad of a choice. But if you decide to pay full price for the Spice Market then I'd advise you to go somewhere else, especially since there's so many great buffet options in Vegas. To good eatings.",2,1,2

Desert selection was okay. They do offer a all you can drink (alcohol) on top of the ~23 dollars for about 12-13 dollars but I'm not a huge drinker so we opted out of that deal.

Took off for the buffet, and was seriously UNimpressed!  Favorite part for me (the ONLY part) was the Italian section. Meatballs and sausage were good.  Liked that they had crushed red pepper to kick things up. Broccolini good.  After that I had a hard time finding anything that looked edible.  Even the seafood section was only so-appealing.  Had a couple crab legs (ice cold) and okay.  The other fish selections didn't make me want them.

Husband was raving over a pork taco in the Mexican section.  They were out of them when I went up there.  Later found one and it was okay.  Nobody working there seemed glad to be there (especially the folks replenishing the food).

There were only three employees seating customers and they were also also doing things at the register, helping with drink orders, and things like that. There were many open tables that were ready to go. 

Finally seated, we went to the food and it was QUITE lackluster. It's divided by cuisine (Middle Eastern, American, seafood, etc) and many of the items just looked like it had been sitting for a while.  It was just very disappointing. 

Funally desserts. We love desserts and a big portion of the desserts are cupcakes. Not everyone is a fan, and also no one wants to eat a full size cupcake. Buffets are about sampling lots of items. Crepe station seemed okay. Soft serve only, no real ice cream.

At 7:45 am the food on the hot line was barely warm, scrambled eggs had the watery separation issues you often see.  Although there was an omelet station - it was not manned.  I waited 2 minutes and then toasted a bagel (at the station) and no one attempted to assist me. Therefore unable to review.

The Eggs Benedict was again lukewarm (current theme again) the eggs cooked well down, but the hollandaise was very good - but as I don't enjoy hard cooked eggs I only had 2 bites.

I did enjoyed my bagel and lox, as I assembled it myself I controlled what was on it. 

The Orange juice was very good.

I tried several pasta dishes and they all tasted the same despite the varied descriptions.

The desert bar was overrun with cupcakes.  Cheap, cheap, cheap.

I tried the Flank Steak and it was chewy despite been cooked medium and the Tandoori Chicken was overcooked.  Had they shredded the chicken they could have re-purposed it as shoe laces.

I'd like to give more than 2 stars but I can't. It was really more like a 2.5 experience, but I can't round up because the food was just that lousy.

The only thing that was half way decent was the prime rib, fruit tart, lemon meringue tart, and the stuffed sole. All of the warm items were cold...selections were dim...meats were all tough except for the ones that I just mentioned. Not sure what happened at the Mediterranean station. Why was everything doused in heavy curry spice?? Isn't curry more of an Asian spice?? The curried cauliflower and chicken were both awful. All that I could taste was heavy curry and no other seasonings..really dreadful dishes...the lamb and chicken kabobs were both dry and cold. The grilled squash was cold, slimy and tastless... I could go on and on about the other items that I tried, but I won't bore you with details, but I will tell you that the other offerings were similar. I didn't get around to the salad bar but I think I should have started there first...

I think that SMB is right around $40 per person sans discounts...it's definitely not worth the money. Quality nor selection are there. There are too many other buffets in Vegas that offer much better food at a better price. The Orleans is one.

It is seriously easy to sign up for the pass and worth the $5 savings. The best day to buy the pass is Sunday because the brunch buffets include the booze free of charge. Also, remember to check the operating hours at each buffet because they do vary.

Note: We did all seven locations (actually 8 buffets because we hit one twice) back to back in 11 hours.

The buffets included in the deal are: Le Village Buffet inside Paris, Planet Hollywood's Spice Market Buffet, Flamingo's Paradise Garden Buffet, Flavors at Harrah's, Lago Buffet at Caesars, the Emperor's Buffet at Imperial Palace and Rio's Carnival World Buffet!

Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood-If you really want to feel as if you are in a hot, stuffy, crowded, spice market, this is the place for you. It is in the basement, so there are no windows and no doors. The line to pay is right in the center of the room and the quarters are mighty tight. There were alot of people in very little space with very little air flow and it was 111 degrees outside...use your imagination.

We hit this stop for brunch. The stations included salad, seafood, Italian, Asian, and ""mid-east."" Yes, I swear it was labeled ""mid-east."" At first I thought it was food from Indiana or Ohio, but I guess they meant ""Middle East"" wink, wink. There was a random selection of Greek and Indian food...surprise, Greece and India are now in the middle east! Oh, and there was hummus.

Overall, the space was dank and depressing. Win was that the champagne was cold and served in a flute. The bigger win was that we saved the life of a fellow diner who was choking with the Heimlich Maneuver. If you do not plan to drink or save a life this stop may be disappointing.",4,3,2

Yet, at this point, a buffet is a buffet is a buffet if it is not one of the two high end places in town. There are some items that made up the low, mid, and high points to our meal. 

Low- Chinese\/Asian- The variety is non-existent. Nothing noteworthy. The crepes are premade and placed back into a frying pan with butter to warm up. 

Mid- Crab legs were anorexic, but at least they were split for easy access. The shrimp were pretty standard as well. Desserts are all standard. 

High- The left half of the Middle East section. Dolmas, Marinaded Feta, Baba Ganoush, and the beef. The meat was seasoned well and very tender. 

At one time they were voted Best Buffet by the Review Journal. Part of me scoffs, because it is the Review Journal, and a part of me agreed with them back then.

I am proud to say that I stuck to my plan only indulging a little by adding a few strips of bacon, but I must admit I was tempted by a few of the many varieties of cultural offering on display. After dropping $66.00 plus a tip for the 3 of us you don't need to be a mathematical wizard to realize this is Vegas and they never lose no matter what the game is and the breakfast buffet is no exception. 

I was very happy with my fresh made omelette and my associates seemed quite please after their third trip or so. As far as buffets go I must say I was quite impressed and if the lunch and dinner offerings equal or exceed the breakfast selections I can see how they remain a popular choice amongst the tourist whether it's really the value most seem to think it is, I guess if you're happy the house is happy and everyone is somewhat a winner.",28,16,21

The options are scarce. The breads, pastries, and pancakes were stale and gross. Something out of a plastic bag, sitting in the back for months.

Should have gone to M or Rio, only reason why I gave them a shot was bc we booked a room here.

We were seeing a show in the same hotel and didn't want to walk far so we decided on this buffet. It looked promising with all the different taste stations, but I was disappointed with all of them. Most of the food was just really low quality. A lot of it was not fresh and had been sitting out for a long time. Everything was just kind of dried out or overcooked. I felt like each station was missing basic components you'd expect to see there. The salad bar only had like 4 vegetables, the noodles in the soup had literally turned to mush, and at a taco bar, you'd expect to find stuff to make tacos not weird looking pork tostadas and burnt quesadillas. The pastas were cold so the cheese on top wouldn't melt. Even the deserts didn't look appetizing and I have a killer sweet tooth. They looked like bland, overly processed, chalky cakes. The staff were also kind of rude and really slow. There was no one in front of us and we probably waited 15 minutes for someone to come seat us. Buffets are really hit and miss, and this was definitely a miss. Our group would have been happier having gone to McDonald's or something for dinner.

I like how all the sections are labeled in large letters ""seafood"", ""dessert"", ""italian"", etc. I love sweets so I tend to put a lot of weight on their quality of desserts. Here, it was a hit or miss with the items. Their ice cream custard was good, esp with chantilly cream, which was excellent quality. They make cotton candy, which was something new so that was pretty cool too. Their fruit tarts were excellent. However, their flan was too stiff on the outside and was more like jello, as was their banana cream pie. The cream was like a stiff block of jello that had been sitting outside for a few hours and allowed to dry....also, their crepes were too thick for my liking. It seemed more like a pancake. 

Now their Mediterranean section was delicious, and their salad bar delicious as well. Their asian section was ok, some of it was good and some was just bland. Their pasta was excellent as well.  Seafood wise, the selection seemed ok.

The soft drinks were delivered and topped up frequently which was good, but the food - just not that good.

I typically don't eat carbs at buffets, and I'm not a dessert fan. Their arnold palmer was really good though. The service is good, and the split snow crab legs were good, but it was hit and miss. Sometimes the batch would be dry, other times they would be moist and flavorful. Can't really complain at a buffet although my $40 says otherwise. The prime rib was decent, not the best I've had but ok. Their desserts looked good and I had a bite here and there of some, but nothing impressive. Their pizza didn't look all that great so I didn't bother and their Mexican is sparse but the middle eastern was decent. I liked the lamb. The tilapia was surprisingly flavorful.

Checked in Saturday @ 830 PM (After waiting in line for 45 minutes)...Walked immediately to the Seafood Line (assuming there were Alaskan Crab Legs)...The label on the sneeze glass read (ACL), but there weren't any there. I don't even think it was Snow Crab! I have no idea what they were serving. The size (width) of the crab legs were equivalent to my pinky or smaller!!! The legs weren't even red and they were an ugly red\/brown color. I'm actually hoping it taste better than it looks after it was steamed, it was salty and the butter couldn't even save it. Absolutely horrible.

While I was waiting in line I noticed someone with a full plate of ACL. I asked the employee where did he get it. He said he got it from the back and it was for a ""Diamond"" member.

I was on some crazy fresh fruit tear that morning, so I got lots of yummy fruit from berries to pineapple to cantaloupe.  I also dug into the oatmeal and there were all kinds of great toppings: craisins, almonds, granola, etc.  My husband had an Egg McMuffin on cheddar cheese steroids and said it was awesome.  And of course, we munched through the usual eggs and sausage and bacon items.

Reading the mixed reviews, I decided most people giving bad reviews were picky. (Lol) 
And I went anyway. After all- I purchased the buffet of buffets pass for $60 w\/tax and this was one that was included in the price. So why not go see for myself? 

Well.... I went here specifically because I was interested in having some middle eastern cuisine. 
In this section, they offered basmati rice, tabouli, couscous, lamb kebab, chicken curry, roasted cauliflower, as well as pita bread, hummus, and tzaziki sauce. 
My first plate at the buffet was a full plate of all these things. Everything was average and the curry was a notch above average. I tried everything. Didn't hate it but wasn't impressed. And the basmati rice, which is usually my favorite part, was Crunchy. Flavor was good, but I definitely needed to be cooked longer. :( 
The lamb was pretty dry and gristley too, which was disappointing after reading one review about how tender and amazing it was. 
They also offered a Mexican, Italian, and Chinese section of which I couldn't find one thing that looked mildly appealing. 

I tried out the American section and had the prime rib and ""Yukon"" mashed potatoes (I read a review to try them... Not sure what Yukon style potatoes are and I didn't find out by eating them...? (Just mashed potatoes with a yellow tint) 
The prime rib was decent and they offered horseradish and horseradish cream 

The seafood seemed to be a pretty high traffic area. Crab legs, mussels, shrimp, etc... 
I tried the three of these things. Crab legs were good, the shrimp and mussels.... :-\/
One thing that I found alarming-- they were piling new crab legs and shrimp on top of the ones that have been just sitting there. Sure, I said it's a high traffic area, but what happens at the end of the day when I get the bottom of the barrel crab leg that's been there for hours... ? Ew.

Then there's the dessert bar. Sounded promising from Fb reviews. And looked promising(see pics) 
BUT it was not as promised. Not at all. 
I found myself picking up dessert after dessert and taking only one bite in order to find something that wasn't Golden Corral bland!!! 
I must've tried eight different items and opted to save the calories for something satisfying and tasty. 
Also, the coffee I got to go along with it was absolutely horrid. So strong that I added the WHOLE carafe of cream and it was still completely undrinkable.
I finished my meal, and then one last time checked the reviews on yelp to be sure that I had tried every item people talked about being worth anything. 

Then I remembered-- the COTTON CANDY! 
Everyone raved about them having cotton candy. So I questioned myself. Could I have possibly missed it? 
Right back to the dessert section I went. Still didn't see it. Well I asked the lady working behind the counter and she was very friendly. She Quickly went to the cotton candy machine (located behind the counter and behind the ice cream soft serve machine) and made me my very own cotton candy puff. :-) yay! 
THE ONLY THING THAT SAVED THIS PLACE FROM GETTING ONE STAR IS THE COTTON CANDY!!!

After asking a few locals their top picks for good buffets are at planet hollywood & at the rio. I've been to spices before & remembered that it was one of the best buffets I've had in vegas as well. So, the bf & I came for sunday brunch [for his first time]. He agreed that it was one of the best buffets that he has had in vegas as well. 

Under the seafood section The buffalo fried shrimp was delicious! I kept going back for more. it had a slight kick but just the right amount. they had shrimp cocktail as well but you'll get your hands dirty with all the lemon squeezing. with the buffalo fried shrimp i munched on it as i walked to my next selection. it was a great balance because i got to clear my plate and add more while walking it off! 

Under american section They have egg benedict as well traditional & one with apple glaze. As I waited patiently for the traditional which ended up tasting like the one with apple glaze because it had a sweet flavor to it. we didn't enjoy it one bit. they ran out of egg benedict and while waiting the guy in the back asked the meat carver to refill the egg benedict so i think without knowing which was what he placed the apple glazed flavor on the regular traditional.

Under the italian section is the mini waffles, pancakes, pizza, etc. im not quite sure why it is under the italian section but it was. 

Under mexican section the carne asada fajita was bomb! the chicken fajita was too dry. 

There's a salad & dessert section too. I didn't get any dessert because I didn't see anything cheesecake related & I wanted to save my belly for jean philippe patisserie. they had ice cream, crepes, etc.

service was fair. you can't expect too much at a buffet. while in line they will hand you a sheet of paper so that you can mark off which drinks you want and you can place it on the table while you grab food. so that's definitely convenient and efficient.

Since we were already here and starving we decided to give it a try. We came here around 5:30 for dinner. Dinner price was $40. The inside is small for a buffet. 

The food was okay. I expected a little better. They had a choice is sea food, italian, American, Asian, middle eastern, and Mexican. They also had a very big dessert area. 

I tried the following:

Sea food

-Sushi- a little hard not very good. They had a veggie roll, spicy tuna and California roll

-Cocktail shrimp- decent 

-Crawfish with rice- pretty good 

-Crab legs- really good I had a whole plate of them

Shrimp penne with pesto- really good a must try 

Crab pasta Alfredo- really creamy and delicious

Italian

-Pepperoni pizza slice- okay I could've probably skipped out on this 

-Blacked chicken pasta-  so good 

-Parmesan garlic wings- really great taste 

American

-Pork loin- so juicy and amazing flavor 

-Steak- amazing it's cooked a little rare but it was just perfect 

-Mac and cheese- it was alright just had about 2 spoons 

Asian

Low mein- not a fan it was a little flavor less 

Fried rice- was good but definitely have had better 

Egg roll- good 

Over all the food was okay. I would've rather paid $10 to Wicked Spoon. The good here just seemed like they heated it up in the microwave. 

The service was good. I left happy and stuffed which is what I wanted.",3,0,0

She was very professional and respectful during our first encounter. She knows the true meaning of customer service. Thank you very much for resolving the issue we had during our visit at Spice Market. However, I am giving this restaurant 1 star less because of the issue below:

I would like to state that i really do not appreciate a waitress who treats me like crap. It was my first time buying the 24-hour buffet pass. At the registration booth, i was informed that i could purchase this at the spice market buffet. Since we were hungry, we went to this buffet for dinner. The cashier did not tell us that there were two options--pay the one time buffet pass OR pay the 24-hr pass. Since it was our first time, i thought she charged me the 24-hour pass (in my mind at the time, this was the only option). I was very hungry so i signed my receipt without looking at the total
Amount charhed, went straight to the buffet, and ate my heart out. Then later, when my mom asked if i have kept the receipt (so we could show the receipt the next day), i realized that they had charged me less than what i expected to pay. I went to the cashier that charged my card and asked her to that i originally wanted the 24-hour pass and the total
Amount charged was incorrect. She blatanly told me that since 15 mins already passed, she is unable to upgrade the ticket. I told her that i wished that she had asked before charging my card that there were 2 options available for purchase. Also, this is not an upgrade or a refund. I simply would like to be charged for the 24hour pass that i originally wanted. She immediately defended herself stating, ""i always ask everyone which option they'd like to buy"". She obviously did not in my case. She sounded like she is not blaming anyone but the customer. Even though i asked nicely if she could reconsider, she did not at least make me feel valued as a customer, who is willing to pay for what was wanted. She did not even offer to consult with her manager, which was the better way to resolve the situation rather than leaving the customer upset and unsatisfied. Anyway, i don't want to mention her name. But please, if you are reading this, make sure you are REALLY asking each and every customer whether they would like to purchase the one time pass or 24-hour pass. Also make sure that since you are working for a customer-driven business, you are making sure that you are making your customers feel respected, valued, and happy.",1,0,0

We've eaten here during prior Vegas visits but it has been about 7 years or so since our last one. Quality has dipped tremendously. Must've sent all of the A Team staff over to Caesar's according to their buffet ratings. Thankfully we purchased our meal at exactly 14:59 according to our receipt so we still paid the ""lunch price"". I can't imagine spending an extra $10 per person on the food we ate.

Prime rib was decent. I had some curry dishes that weren't too bad. Ribs were fatty and inedible. I felt like I wasted a lot of food because the quality was so bad.

My husband had a few pot stickers and spring rolls which he said were very good. I can't recall what else he ate. Usually when our food is good we discuss it during the meal and offer bites to each other.

Other than the dessert station, nothing was very memorable about the buffet. It needs an overhaul. Badly.

Double bummer - - their cotton candy machine was broken. That alone was probably the only reason I was in favor of coming here during this trip.

Then I had enough room for a sliver of prime rib and candied sweet potato.  YUM.  We finally finished off the meal with a taste of 4 different cupcakes and a fruit tart.  I could have lost control and eaten it ALL.

I agree that there were plates of things that just didn't make sense on why they were at a buffet (mashed potatos?  pasta?  corn muffins?) Why would you fill up on that nonsense?!  Their kabobs looked good, too but we just had no room in our bellies anymore.

I personally rank this as the 4th best buffet in Las Vegas (after Carnival World, Le Village and the Bellagio Buffet). The price is rather steep, but they offer locals a 20% discount (which is barely advertised, so if you are a local, make sure you let the cashier know). Another con is that the service isn't all that good, at least from my experience, but I feel that if a restaurant is really good, then it's worth it to endure sub-par service. 

They have a wide diversity of stations (including a Middle Eastern station, something that's rare in buffets), and they're all widely spread apart so definitely be prepared to do some walking. Typically you expect buffet pizza to be generic and plain by default but the pizza here was actually pretty exceptional. The dessert section was also quite huge, just don't order crepes there, since the crepes are pre-made and not fresh.

The rest of the food is hit or miss. The last trip we went some of the food had been sitting out too long and was cold\/crunchy. The pork (carnitas) taos was the best thing I ate that night. Hard to make up $45 for a buffet with tiny carnitas tacos... And the service wasn't great either. We got ignored half the time by our waitress. All I wanted wsa some napkins and a tea refill.When we first got there I was lookiing for the hot crab legs they used to have and couldn't find them so I asked a cook behind the serving station ""Do you still have hot crab legs?"" He said ""We are unable to answer your questions. If you need an answer talk to your waiter"". Ok... A simple no would have sufficed.

-Meatballs: CRAP (not in a bad way), they were good! I'm not normally an Italian eater, but I couldn't resist and was also tempted by the Fresh pepperoni pizza- another yummy choice btw.
-Berry salad with lemon cream. Might sound strange, but the lemon flavor is very faint. It was more sweet than sour!

While I was not overly impressed with their Asian or and poor seafood offerings -- though the sliced crab legs and crab rangoon were fine -- their Indian, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern dishes (and reasonable pricing) make it worth a quick trip for lunch.

Here you can find a variety of meat kebabs, grilled veggie skewers, tomatoes stuffed with ground lamb, couscous, chicken tandoori, and a number of curry dishes that will manage to sit in your tummy just fine.

It's also a lot more kid friendly than most other Vegas buffets, and offers a cotton candy station, and a crepe-making station for dessert.

You get a pretty good selection of food here, and for the price, you don't feel like you're getting ripped off like the Mirage. The quality is actually pretty good! Most of the time we come to eat here, we are in deep into lunch and early dinner, so we get a little bit of everything! So here are the things I love about this place..

1. Crab legs. of course. Not watery, not salty, not too cold. Just everything you would expect of a GOOD crab leg. 

2. Cotton Candy. How fun is this? 

3. Cookies. I think every time we come here, my roommates steal the cookies. HAHA no joke.

4. Baked Potato Station. You get a card and fill out what you want, and turn it in. The potatoes are HUGE! They load them up REAL GOOD and to my disappointment, had no room for it.... So I can't wait to try that next time. I love potatoes by the way....

5. Burger Station. Cooked to order - or so I've been told. Okay.. it's been 2 years??? And never have I seen the damn burger station!!!! I try and try and try.. lunch and dinner, but NO BURGER STATION!!! So apparently they only do it during the weekdays for lunch (I believe). Darn... I hear they are pretty darn good though. I must try...

6. Eggs Benedict. Not too salty. Hollandaise is scrump-dili-umtious!! 

I think those are the highlights. The mexican station is one of my favorites as well.. although the meat could be... tastier? And not look like little drops of poop. But cover that crap up with some salsa, cheese, sour cream, and guac, and you've got yourself a pretty darn good burrito. Oh! And be careful around that station.. for some reason, they always have that shit extra hot so your arm literally feels like it's getting on fire.

So compared to the Wynn, I like both. But for any Vegas first timer, I'd probably recommend this place or the Bellagio simply because Bellagio takes it in presentation, but I do enjoy the food at Planet Hollywood more if you want simplicity and comfort.

So, it gets annoying if you have a party of 6 and this party of 4, who's already on their 3rd plates, decide to move to a roomier table. Yeah, not cool.

The food was alright, there was plenty of options to chose from, and the service was good.

Brunch:
Disappointing honestly. I feel like for a buffet on the strip, and for $25 per person, the options should have been better than any regular hotel\/inn breakfast options. Also, the food's taste wasn't as good as you would think.

We came here during Christmas week for vacation and had our eyes set on Buffet of Buffets. We waited in line for an hour and it was finally our turn at the register. Turns out B.O.B. prices were increased by $20 for the holidays, but whatever right?
I had a Total Rewards card to get the member discount and figured it'd work for the total bill (just as it had for all the other places I'd been to) but the lady at the register insisted that all adults needed it. So fine, we go upstairs and get them and come back. AND THEN, we give her our gift card that a family friend gifted us, and she claims it doesn't work. Wtf bro (no one else had problems with it throughout our entire trip). So we decide to just settle and pay for just this meal. $200ish for 6 people. We get in line to be seated.

Once we are seated, we went to get food. I walk around twice, ending up with a slice of Prime rib and some mashed potatoes. There's nothing good here. The crab legs were dry and grimy looking, all other seafood included popcorn\/bbq shrimp and baked sole. The only other things that looked edible were the grilled skewers in the Middle Eastern section. The dessert is whack. Cupcakes and cotton candy?

Wow I can just say me and my friends were very disappointed. While they have a lot of different types of food (Salads, Mexican, Middle Eastern, Asian, Seafood, American, Italian, and Desserts) the quality was just abysmal. As I was walking around and checking out what i wanted to try, I had a very difficult time actually putting stuff on my plate, because the food just did not look appetizing at all. In the end, I tried to get a couple of different items and each was just taste disgusting and just I just couldn't finish. I thought the desserts might redeem the buffet but even though the desserts looked decent, they tasted just horrible. I can say the only thing I liked from the buffet was the watermelon.

Another one of their specialties is cupcakes. Now, when you arrive - head directly for the middle eastern section for delicious, and freshly grilled skewer meat and vegetables.  Are you a crab legs fan?  All you can eat snow crab are ready for you to get your hands into!  Other highlights are the steamed BBQ pork bun (think dim-sum), curry chicken, handmade meatballs, pork street tacos (I added guacamole of course!), California Rolls, and the tomatoes stuffed with ground lamb!  Even the salads and fruits all tasted fresh.

Service was good, though the lady at the register kept pushing the ""club card"" for the hotel.  No thank you.

It was pretty good for taking the elevator down and have a choice of just about any kind of food you want. I don't think you can expect lobster and crab at 11:00am in the morning, but you will get some things like prime rib and other nice cuts of meat. 

If you're not gambling then you're probably going to pay full price at like $25 or more. Coming from Chicago this is a pretty steep price. You're only in Vegas so much, so why not right? I would probably go back here again if I could eat twice as much or if I had a huge amount of comps. If you got money to blow, you're really hungry and don't want to go far from the hotel, then you can get away with eating here and being happy about it.",0,0,0

The food there isn't consistent. I tend to go after the prime rib and it's usually super rare or overly cooked when I get it. I've only had it perfectly cooked twice. Also, I don't recommend the Asian section of the buffet especially the pho because the dishes there lacks a lot of flavor or they over season their dishes.

One major complaint that I have at this buffet is that it's always hard to flag down the waiters, waitresses. When we need extra utensils or a refill on our drinks, they said they'll come back in a minute which turns into fifteen minutes. It's kind of ridiculous. I have also had a bad experience with one of the waitresses having a bad attitude. My boyfriend asked for an Arnold Palmer with Raspberry Iced Tea and she gave this face and said, ""Can't you order something else like, a coke?"" Come on now..don't need to get crazy over a drink order.

Even though the food isn't perfect, I do enjoy coming here because most of the food they offer is pretty good. I also really love their dessert bar. The first time I ate here, they had this chocolate mousse and it was the best chocolate mousse I ever had. I keep coming back here hoping that I can have it again but my luck has always been bad and have never seen it since. Other than that, I like the pies that they offer.

They should call it the Black market buffet, cause more than 1\/2 the items are from another dimension
Went for lunch and was looking forward to one thing mainly: crab legs. After forking over 35\/person WITH players card for brunch, headed right at seafood section, only to be told ""sir crab legs are served at dinner only."" That's bullshit, used to be all the time.
The only good item was the potato leek soup, and somewhat edible is the tandoori grilled chicken skewers that look like its alien meat color.
The salad bar is so weak, never saw any bar like this only toppings are cheese, dressings, and croutons. What a joke.
Mexican section is tragic, no taco meat, instead you have mystery bean dish, and steak fajitas that looked awful. They have chicken taco as carbon tasted bland, ice cold, bits of bones couldn't chew, and crappy.
Asian section droned in sauce some unidentifiable items, again very limited.
Italian section had a 1\/4 cheese and a 1\/4 pepperoni pizza that was still there, no new pizzas made, in the 30 min we were there. Awful.
Some other breakfast leftover items, and disguting dishes drenched in sauce that looks like where the griswolds ate with their inbred cousins in Vegas Vacation.
If was really, really bad. 
Oh, their deserts looked good, they have a big section for that, I just don't care for sweets. They should close the buffet and just do a sweets buffet. 
I knew when there was no wait, yes, NO WAIT on a Saturday to be seated, I shouldve walked away.

However, I've been fortunate to always find a 2 for 1 on Groupon. The last time we went here the Groupon was a 2 for 1 with a bottle of champagne. Not shabby at all.

When I come here I go for their prime rib which is always exceptionally made. I also like that their crab legs are sliced open so that I don't have to use my crab cracking skills to open my son's & boyfriend's crab legs. More crab time for me! :D

The desserts are ok. They have a crepe station, but the crepes are pre-made. :\/

This place can get a very long wait line. The first time I was here I waited almost 2 hrs.! That's a bit too long to wait when you're starving.

I finally visited this place today with my family, and sad to say it didn't really live up to the hype at all.

The buffet is pretty big, with various selections of food. There are quite a lot of sections, such as Asian, American, Middle Eastern, Mexican, Salad, Seafood, and Desserts. Despite this, none of the foods really stand out. The food was mediocre, and I didn't feel compelled to ever want to visit this buffet again. 

I think the worst section here is the desserts. They served cupcakes, mini cakes, crepes, tarts, and ice cream, but not a single one really made me want to take another bite. I probably sound conceited or stuck up saying this...but if you're looking for a buffet with a good dessert selection, I would say pass this buffet and look somewhere else.

I never really write reviews but in this case I made a Yelp account just to write this one because its really that bad. My boyfriend and me went on the Sunday of memorial during lunch, it was 75 bucks and although the food was ok, the service was sooooooo bad. Our sever brought our first drinks and then disappeared, almost an hour later I asked the server on the next table for drink refills and she seemed bothered but did it. And then still didn't get any more service. As we were leaving I asked the second server  what happened to our first one and she said that she was our server and the other server who disappeared were Hmmmmm, why  did she keep that info to herself when I asked her what had happened to our server earlier. WOW, you have a server who pretends to not be your server, unbelievable.
I spoke to manager and told him how bad the service was, we have much less at other places and gotten 10 times better service than this, he apologized and asked us to please come back and give them another chance. I should have refused, it wasn't about money it was the whole experience, but I thought maybe they were busy over the holiday so accepted his offer for us to go back. The next time we went on Tuesday around 1pm, this time there was no server to ask what we wanted to drink, just a paper on the table for us to check off what we wanted so we didn't have to wait for the server and go straight to the buffet, she still didn't bring all the drink we checked off, she never came back once to check on us, service is so bad.

How shyte do the other buffets have to be, if this was the winner.

Dont get me wrong, they get top points for range, cleanliness, great table spacing (not all crammed together) and rate of turn over to get people seated and presentation...but the deciding factor, the food was crap.

We do appreciate that is more of an American cultural thing that food isn't as heavily flavored - we're lived and traveled all over the world and American food is generally famous for its blandness. But HOW can you have a buffet with foreign food and make that bland too?

We tried a breakfast and a lunch buffet - we wanted to give the buffet the benefit of the doubt and try it again to make sure it wasn't as bad as the first day - and it was. 80% of what we took, we ended up not eating.

Kudos does go to the dessert section, the Mexican section and the fresh roasts. The rest was pretty below edible.

We had fried shrimp that was still FROZEN in the middle, and tasted like dirty grease on the outside (unfortunately dirty grease was as far as any flavour went), Asian fried rice whose rice was only about 1\/3 cooked, stir frys with no flavor, Mediterranean food that would make the Mediterranean's weep with sorrow, fish that had a similar textural consistency to bathroom grout..and the same taste I assume too, and vegetables that you wonder how long they sat in the truck in the desert before they made it to the table.

Tell me I'm up myself...I don't care. But when you're paying $45+ for 2 people to eat international food, you expect at least some of it to be edible.  All I can say is that we had a buffet at the Silver Legacy in Reno that ran rings around this place... RENO people. What does that have to say about this place?

3.5 stars, but I'll give it 4 for the heck of it. I didn't expect a whole lot from the buffet at Planet Hollywood, but maybe that is why I was pleasantly surprised. After going to the Bellagio and finding a ""holiday menu"" at the buffet with subsequent elevated prices for the weekend, my buddy and I decided to head across to PH and give that one a try. 

The buffet itself can be a little tricky to find depending on what door you come in. It's set in the basement and seems almost forgotten about. Compared to the fancier casino floor above it, the buffet seems dark and dingy. However, it's really not that bad once you get settled in.

Prices aren't cheap, but are decent for what you get. There are plenty of little sections with different types of food, including an interested Middle Eastern section which...well, half of it seemed Greek. Maybe they think Greece is in the Middle East? Meh...

They even have hot AND cold snow crab legs, which were fairly decent (though the hot ones were a bit dry). I found them better and easier to eat than at the Paris buffet a couple days prior. 

Dessert was really boring. It's basically just a big section of cupcakes. People love cupcakes, I know, but come on...can you serve anything other than cupcakes? Sure, there are a few other things hidden in the shadows, but not really. I tried two, and one was very good...but the other wasn't. 

Service was good but not great. She got us our refills and cleared our plates, but didn't smile throughout the process. Oh well, I'm getting used to that at buffets in Vegas. 

I'm giving it 4 stars (again, rounded up from 3.5) because it was better than expected. If I had gone in with the foolish mindset of getting something as good or similar to Wynn of Bellagio, I would give it 2 stars...but I would hit myself for being that stupid too.

We were there around 5-6:30pm tonight (Wednesday). Our 4 year old daughter is allergic to pistachios, peanuts, and cashews so when eating out we always check if the foods we're ordering for her have any of those ingredients. With buffets, we usually check with the staff that are plating the foods (common sense would be that they would know what goes into the food). There was a lemon macaroon which we specifically asked the staff that was behind the dessert station if it had any peanuts, cashews or pistachios. They told us that it only had almonds and a lemon filling. About 20 minutes later our daughter's eyes were swollen and she broke out in hives. We called Planet Hollywood once we got back to the hotel to talk to the chef to double check the ingredients so we could know of this was a new allergy or not, and come to find out the macaroons did contain pistachios. The chef was surprised that the staff didn't mention it.

Needless to say, we gave her Benadryl, called our on call nurse and are currently monitoring her for any serious signs of a severe allergic reaction. Bottom line, DON'T TRUST THE STAFF TO KNOW WHAT IS IN THE FOODS.

Edit: Just to round out this review, the food was a lot better than the previous time we had tried this buffet. I'm not sure if its because they were busier last night than when we had went before.

I had already blown a lot of money  (w\/out ever touching a slot machine or a table) and I wanted to make sure that this place was worth it.  

The place was packed and sitting next to us were the entire Miss America Pageant contestants.  I'm not sure how relevant this observation was, but it was nice to see some eye candy, along with poke fun at how it must be some competition to see how little they could eat. 

As with most buffets, the food seemed to go on forever.  I did the smart thing and walked all the way down, taking key notes on everything that caught my eye.  Omelette station?  Yes.  Flaming Crepes?  Yum.   Tempura Shrimp?  Hell yes I was going to stop by there.  

Omelette's are great at any time of the day and I was not disappointed with this one.  The bell peppers, mushrooms, olives, tomatoes and melted cheese were folded in perfectly and tasted oh so good.  I tried keeping the carbs down to a minimum here since I wanted to try a little bit of everything.  

I stopped over to grab some Tempura Shrimp and since my stomach was grumbling by now,  I picked one off my plate and took a little bite.  Did I say little bite?  Well, one bite turned into 3 killed Shrimp.  They were done before I made the long walk back down to my table.  Along the way, I grabbed some cod stuffed with crab and some fried wontons.  

First plate was a success!!  I know some of you have to feel me on this when you go to a buffet and the first round picks always don't make it to the finals.  Not in this case.  Everything on my plate (even tho I didn't wipe it clean) was good!  I was also introduced to some Middle Eastern food when my sis forked me over some awesome tasting hummus into my mouth.  I'm not a big hummus eater and this was something that I could see myself having in my fridge.  

Miraculously, I did *not* touch the desert station because I was so full from having a fresh strawberry filled crepe.. I do have to say that seeing this crepe made with the alcohol flames was quite the spectacle.  The whipped cream on this baby was *fresh*,  not the store bought kind).  And the drizzle of chocolate was definitely not Hershey's.. 

My only regret was that I wish I came with a bigger appetite.  Having gotten completely wasted into the wee hours of the morning, my stomach could only take so much.  

I would definitely recommend this place after going here.  But, I'd be lying to say that I would come back.  This is Vegas and there are way too many places that I'd like to try (like the Wynn Buffett)!  before making my way back.",0,0,2

This buffet didn't disappoint.  LOTS of variety of foods.  Everything seemed fresh.  If you like cupcakes you've come to the right place; I think I counted 10 varieties plus soft-serve Custard.  Not many cakes or cookies though, primarily just fresh cupcakes.

I had a generous helping of Prime Rib and some ham, both were nicely cooked.  I also enjoyed some of the best mashed potatoes I've had in a long time!

The only drawback's I saw were, there is no self-serve beverage station; you must order soft drinks and water from a waiter and sometimes the wait time for a waiter seemed a bit long.  I also thought the cost ($30 a person for dinner on a Thursday night) was high, however the food was good and being on the strip it's probably one of the more affordable buffet's you'll see on the strip.

My boyfriend and I went to the Spice Market buffet totally on a whim on our first night in town last week.  We were very pleasantly surprised not only by the quantity of the food served but also by the quality.  Two of the highlights were the pizza (which was considerably better than some pizza I have ordered and paid for from an actual PIZZA joint) and the Middle Eastern food station.  That section had the best hummus my boyfriend found on our entire trip along with tandoori chicken, naan, dolmas, baba ghanoush, and other assorted things that you don't often find on a buffet line (or if you do, it's usually gross).  The desserts were also high-quality and delicious.

One of the nicest things about this buffet was that it was organized better than most any other we went to during the week (perhaps with the exception of the Carnival World Buffet at Rio).  Every food station is clearly marked and stays within the boundaries of a certain theme (Mexican, Italian, etc.) - you'd think this was just a no-brainer, but try navigating the buffet at Paris (where half of the food is un-labeled) and tell me how much you appreciate it.

Glad to know someone fixed the times!) and they were nice enough to immediately seat us right in front of the desserts so we had quick access. They let us know that food will be put away by 11:30 and that we'd have to leave by 11:45. They gave us a list of drinks to choose from and we just checkmarked a whole bunch that sounded good so we could hurry along and fill up our plates.

We came to Spice Market with two people on a Saturday evening at about 8:45PM.  This place suffers from utter disorganization. There is one hostess that was seating people, and there was no order like other buffets. At other buffets they usually have multiple people hosting and taking care of tables.  This place...not at all.  We actually walked around the restaurant three times with her, while she waited for a busser to clean off a table.  It was ridiculous. She had no idea where she was taking us.

The good news and the reason for my one star improvement is the food truly was better.  Almost everything I had was good to very good.  I was pleased with the food and the taste and quality seemed to be improved.

The one thing that made me more upset than anything else, was the fact that they have eliminated all service from this buffet.  I believe in tipping, and I believe in tipping at or above the normal rate.  I believe service people work very hard.  Even at a buffet, I tip.  Therefore, when I entered, because you pay upon arrival, I tipped $5.00 (which I feel is appropriate for limited service at a buffet).   However, to my surprise, after getting to the table -- I was shocked to find out that there is no longer service at this buffet. That is correct folks -- they have completely 100% eliminated all service.  Other buffets usually have drink service...not this one.  You get everything on your own.  Is that a problem?  No, it is not.  However, there should be absolutely no gratuity line on the receipt.  In fact, when you went up to get a drink, they wanted a tip. When you went to the crepe station, they wanted a tip.  There is no excuse for this and it reflects negatively on Planet Hollywood and this buffet.",3,1,1

We came to Planet Hollywood not only looking for food to ease our rolling stomachs, but for a buffet that will blow our minds (and taste buds).

Alas! Blow my mind, it did not. However it seemed to blow my wallet away. The line was extremely long - even being tipsy didn't help. Cheery though I was, this line didn't seem to want to budge. I even saw an old-lady try to bribe her way in with $100 but there is no mercy for the buffet -bystanders. She was promptly sent to the back of the line. Ouchhhh. After much waiting, hopping and frequent trips to the bathroom, we finally got into the buffet - SCORE! Although at this point, I was painfully sober and even hungrier.

The food was.... all right. 
Typical Vegas AYCE fare with the exception of the King Crab legs. Nothing remarkable or special. I was even disappointed with the desserts. For me, desserts are key. If they put in a lot of work in their desserts then you know that their entrees are doubly good. The Flan tasted off and the Strawberry tart was spoiled by watching this old man pick off all the strawberries and leave the tart there. Really old man. As if the old lady bribing her way out of line was so much better. 

However, unlike other Vegas AYCE buffets, the Spice Market Buffet is unique in that it offers a Middle Eastern section, which is a pleasant break from the usual Italian, Seafood and American sections. Their marinated feta cheese was de-LISH.

ASIAN - Out of everything there my husband enjoyed the white rice the most (which I find quite sad). 

DESSERT - It was nothing special, very generic. The frozen yogurt not good (how do you mess up a frozen yogurt machine?). They have a crepe station but guess what...the crepe are already pre-made all they do is heat it up for you.

MEDITERRANEAN- The lamb and chicken was decent. The Indian food all looked like it had been sitting there.

MEXICAN - By far the worst station, everything was dry!

If you have any standards of food for yourself DO NOT GO HERE. It is a waste of money and time. On top of all the terrible food when we got there we had to pay for taxes (bc we had already paid for dinner through Groupon) they wouldn't allow us to tip the server with a credit card so I had to go out of my way to get cash. 

When there manager in the cashier department asked me how dinner was when I was leaving I told her it was terrible and instead of asking why she just smiled and said nothing else...",0,0,0

This is a middle of the road buffet (aka, there are worse in Vegas but also not comparable to Wynn's, Bucchanal, Wicked Spoon).

- Crab legs were just okay
- Desserts were limited to mostly cupcakes and self serve soft serve ice cream (come on, this is VEGAS, I expect gelato!). They did however have cotton candy which is cool.
- Themed stations were all meh, except the Mediterranean station which was the highlight.

Don't expect Bachannal quality food but my 4 stars is purely for the value with the groupon as we were both satisfied.

Unlimited bottled Coronas and Heineken plus champagne...that was worth at least $10 by itself...so on the other $10 I spent of the $20 I got:

Split snow crab legs
shrimp cocktail
prime rib (ehh..)
Indian style skewered lamb (good)
Some quesadillas from Mexican section with guac & salsa
Creme Brulee
Strawberry and creme Crepe

Considering we kept rotating mostly between king crab and shrimp cocktail while drinking all we could, the groupon was definitely worth it and we both left feeling we had a decent meal for a great price.

Our waitress, Rose was excellent, friendly and provided great service.

I would definitely come back again with a groupon offer and hit the same items.

This is not the Bellagio, this is not the Wynn, so scale back your expectations accordingly.

That being said, it is surprisingly large and when I went on a weekend for dinner just after 5PM, the wait was less than 5 minutes. Maybe some consider that a bad sign, but as we dined business picked up.

Came using a BOGO Groupon- all you can eat and all you can drink for two for $46. Not bad at all. Pricing was not available online to see what locals prices were or which deal was better, but gave it a shot. The $11.50 extra for all you can drink option is not something I'd pay to add on in the future- BF and I each had two drinks (beer and champagne, respectively) and did not feel it was worth it.

Food is divided up by cuisine style:
Seafood- snow crab legs and shrimp plentiful, but disappointed with sushi. Very little was out and it was all dry and falling apart as if it was left over from lunch or the day before. Was never restocked during our visit. Only consisted of simple cucumber, salmon and california rolls. Avocado in the CA roll was brown, ew. You'd think with crab and shrimp available, there would be a better selection.

Salad- loved the wedge salads available, haven't seen that many places!
Soups- only chicken noodle and tortilla were available, didn't look appetizing.

Italian- pastas all looked as if they'd been sitting out, but meatball was tasty. I'm mostly avoiding carbs, so I did not really spend much time in this area.

Chinese- very generic, did not have anything here.

Barbecue- BF enjoyed the prime rib, yukon gold mashed potatoes were delicious, barbecue pork shank was tasty! Despite signage for sliders, only fried chicken kept being put out. It was tasty but not my thing.

Dessert- Tons of cupcakes. Not sure why they're so large, seems wasteful as most people are only taking a bite or two and trying other flavors. Someone probably needs to rethink this.

Mid-Eastern- grilled veggies, chicken and lamb were all good, tabouli and naan flavorful, lamb tagine was surprisingly true to flavor.

Mexican- Like the Italian area, disappointing. All food was very basic and appeared to have been sitting out.

Salad- lots of cheeses, breads, and spreads available here. Opted for a lot of fresh fruit and got a wedge of brie with some fruity bread, very tasty.",8,0,2

Speaking from my own experience, the service and the meat dishes are descent.  I like some of the ethic foods too but most of it is pretty gross.  It's either too bland or painfully salty.  The seafood is completely inedible.  The crablegs are super salty and the fish is dry as jerky.  If you're fine with getting your money's worth eating mediocre cocktail shrimp, I guess that's fine.

The toppings were not made fresh except the pico de gallo. The guacamole was watered down. The meats didn't look very good and just sitting there drying up...The cheese quesadilla was not good! It wasn't hot and the cheese was hardened. All I have to say is that I was sad...

Nothing against Mediterranean foods, but once I tried this awhile back...I wasn't feeling very well, so I can't say much about this station. But the kabobs looked nice. American selection wasn't that great...I asked for a rare slice of prime rib and they gave me well done, not very good with service. (Could have said to wait for the next one to come out). So I decided to wait later and the meat was a bit of a tug to eat, but descent though. There was also sausage and ham. Chicken noodle soup at first tasted good, but the second bite...man you definitely can taste the black pepper. (Broke a sweat...JK!) The macaroni and cheese didn't look that good to eat...should have stuck with my first impression, but decided to take a huge portion still. This tasted horrible...the macaroni was cooked thank goodness compared to Bacchanal Buffet...but the cheese was overcooked and didn't have enough flavor. Another disappointment.

The dessert station was like watching Cupcake Wars...WAY TOO MANY! Just looking at the different flavors of cupcakes made me want to chuck everything back out. I did try the red velvet cupcake and it was dry. The icing...do not know what was sour in there...Then, I tried the fruit tart, which was not very good except the crust. The cheesecake was extremely thick and bland. 

Overall, I would not recommend coming here, but we got to Vegas late and stayed at Paris...So the second closest place to eat was Planet Hollywood. However, service here was ok...not the best. Didn't take plates very often. Also...where I sat...it was broken...so I got a bruise on my booty... =( I guess the unlimited apple juice made up for it though =]",4,0,1

I tried the almond-crusted seabass from the American section, but it was very salty and tough.  The ltalian wasn't appeal, and the seafood, while tasty, seemed a bit oversalted.  My husband enjoyed his food from the American section, though, and everyone else I saw eating seafood clearly liked it.

Food used to be so good here, back in the Aladdin days. The seafood was fresh and there was lots of it, all different types. Now you are left with crab legs and shrimp; my guess? both from the same distributor that does all the buffets. In other words, flash frozen, not much flavor, ordinary not extraordinary stuff. 

There wasn't one item I ate today that I would consider tasting 'good'. Not excellent, just 'good'. That's how far my standards have fallen here. The prime rib piece that I got was well done. I would say it once had a chance at good flavor, but not when it reached that temperature. The sushi consisted of three types all stacked on top of it other in one tray. Other than that, everything I ate, I literally took one bite of and then stopped. Even my 5 year old son, who loves desserts, stopped after one bite of his creme brulee and fruit tart. He didn't like either. Doesn't that sum it up? And I haven't started with my two major complaints. First is the price. My son, who again is 5, costs a whopping $19.99. That is highway robbery. Our dinners costs $36.99. Again a huge gouge fest. This buffet, in terms of quality and taste, I wouldn't pay more than $9.99.

And since the line was so long, they had an upstairs line, then the escalator, then it continues to a downstairs line. My cousin was waiting in line for us, and she had gotten to the downstairs part. The idiot who was controlling the top of the escalator wouldn't let me pass, even though my cousin was downstairs. In fact he didn't let many people pass, who's families were already in the downstairs line. Do people really f you over so much that you are a dick to all the families? Do you think I'm trying to bs you, as I am pushing my aunt in her wheelchair? Did you think the wheelchair was fake too so I can get some sympathy from you and try to steal my place in the front of the line?

They say that variety is the Spice of life. And the Spice Market Buffet is a culinary walk of fame with cuisine stars represented in nine food stations: seafood, two salad bars, soup, dessert, Mid Eastern, Italian, American, Asian, and Mexican.

  Asian Foods:  The foods represented included spicy drunken noodles, Kung Pae chicken, miso soup, honey nut chicken, tilapia, fried rice,  and spring rolls. I really enjoyed the spicy drunken noodles and miso soup. The spicy drunken noodles remind me of chow fun. The miso soup was tasty and served in larger bowls than at Courtyard Buffet. I would of appreciated it if they had wonton soup. It seems that that Cravings Buffet is the only buffet on the Strip serving wonton soup. 

 Soup: I was filling up on soup. So I passed over the chicken noodle and tortilla soup. 

Mexican: There was a decent selection of Mexican food. The foods represented included Mexican corn, Spanish rice, Charro beans, Chile cheese, quesadilla, grilled chicken, and fajitas. 

American : This station seemed to have the longest line. This makes sense because it appeared to be the only live station. They cooked turkey and prime rib that the chefs cut and placed on your plate. Near the meat was rice pilaf, ribs, mash potatoes, and BBQ spice chicken. The Asian and seafood stations were filling me up and I passed over the fresh cut prime rib and turkey. 

Seafood: This is the Spice Market Buffet station that is worthy of an Oscar. There was far more seafood than the so-called Station buffets that double the price and make a steak and shrimp gimmick on a popular night that people go out. This got the most action on my plate. The seafood represented included sushi, seafood paella, shrimp scampi pasta, stuffed sole, snow crabs, Cajun crawfish pasta, and peel eat shrimp. This seafood station is my minimal expectation of a seafood buffet. 

Mid Eastern: The neat thing about buffets is they bring out the adventurous eater. What is the worst thing that could happen if you try something and you dislike it? I was adventurous when I went to the Mid Eastern station. What should I try? There was chicken curry, couscous salad, lamb, Taboull,  hummus, and kabobs. I'd try the couscous salad and hummus. I'm glad I got to try it because now I know that I don't care for Mid Eastern food. 

Italian food: If there was eggplant parmesain or veal parmesain, I would of filled up less in the seafood station. I was not crazy over the selection. They had pizza, pasta, meatballs, and some other food. 

REPORT OF MY 11\/01\/2015 VISIT:

   If you sign up for a Harrah's credit card, they reward you with two complimentary buffets. My brother took advantage of this deal. He invited me along for the zero cents buffet. Around 5 pm on a Sunday we met up there. We saved over $29 each. And we saved on time.  There was no line. And there was zero waiting on the server to ask you what to drink. Upon paying for the buffet, you order the beverage that the server brings to the table. In lieu of waiting for the server, I made a beeline for the food stations. I'd mostly full up on Asian foods and seafood to the point that I passed over dessert. Throughout the dinner, the server occasionally checked up on us and never rushed us. 

   The Spice Market Buffet was an Academy Award Winning scene in the basement of Planet Hollywood. However it falls short of being an Academy Award Buffet. In my opinion it falls in the middle of Las Vegas Strip buffets. In Yelp ratings, the middle is 3 stars.",12,7,5

So I had to check it out..not to mention it was easy to get to.  I had breakfast there friday morning, and dinner there saturday night.
   Price: Breakfast $15 per person, Dinner $25 per person. Not on the cheap side, but still fair. Especially for the quality of food.
  Wait:  Breakfast we showed up at 10:00 am, 2-3 people ahead of us in line, quickly seated.  Dinner, about 6 people ahead of us, the cashier took no time to get to, but getting a table for 6 took a little while, and was slightly annoying (probably about 10-15 mins)....probably would've been easier if there wasn't some wedding banquet going on on the other side of the restaurant. We ended up doing the..lets' just stand next to the table of 6 grannies not eating and chatting..and talk real loud about how hungry we are and how we wish we had  a table that could hold six people..I think they got the hint and left quickly.  

Food Quality - Breakfast was good with many options, the omlet station line was a little long so I passed on it. but everything else was good..besides...how bad does a buffet got to be to screw up scrambled eggs, sausage, hash browns, chicken fried steak? 
Dinner - was awesome. The different stations for different cuisine was good too.  The middle east kabobs were very good..i liked the lamb a lot, but the Chicken was kind've weird (marinated in chasu sauce which is chinese and reserved for pork).  Mexican looked like your standard Taco bar...I passed. The roast beef was very good, potato bar had some nice options. Asian cuisine had terrible egg rolls (as expected), but the tempura shrimp was good (too bad no dipping sauce). the quality of sushi was very good though..so I grabbed a lot..(*tip*..eat the raw fish as sashimi only..screw the rice)..salmon, tuna, eel...Wanna-be Sushi conossiuers would you prefer me to use the japanese names?!?  Okay fine...meji, sake, and unagi. i took 4 years of japanese but it's horrible..hahah..
  Anyway, the italian station was very good as well...as they had a variety of different pastas..the lobster pasta was quite tasty, and the cheese raviolis as well..The pizza looked good too, but i passed as..I did not spend $25 to eat pizza. Lastly the seafood..which mainly composed of Oysters and Alaskan King crab was good..I did not try the oysters (i try only to eat premium oysters for fear of food poisoning)...but the alaskan king crab legs were great and plentiful..of course a line for that, but not too bad...once you got past the little old ladies who always stakced 20 legs on their plate...just do your part as well. The soups were good as well...I had a creamy Tomato Basil soup..nice.
  
Service - we were never left with empty glasses, plates cleared quickly. it was sad to see one server clear a table for six people all by herself. we left her a good tip, she was a friendly server and  a hard worker.  and was very on top of always keeping our drinks filled.

overall -  I highly recommend Spice Market Buffer, the prices are fair, the food quality is very good, and the amount of variety is good as well. I'll be there for lunch next time in Vegas as i was craving some Clam Chowder I saw being prepared for lunch while i was there for breakfast.

The wait was a little long for lunch time and the prices were jacked up cuz of holidays but when we got in and ate, it was pure pwnage. They had a section dedicated to each type of food, from seafood, american, italian, asian, mexican, middle eastern, and so many different types of desserts its not even funny. Actually, it is so not funny, that it is funny... Ha Ha.  
    The main food that i liked was the usual prime rib because what Las Vegas buffet doesnt have Prime Rib... It was bloody, just the way it should be and yes... it became good friends with my mouth. Also there were endless king crab legs and shrimp. A Meal fit enough for a Hilton. The service was good too, never saw the bottom of my glass. Thanks Omar for all of your great service. Keep it up and there will be many more Washingtons in your pocket. 
    Watever food u can think of they probably have it. The asian part was a little dissapointing tho, maybe because im asian and i know what the good stuff is... I didnt try tthe mexican food or the soup\/salad because i want to get my 28 dollars worth of food. The fruit was good too. Watermelons were crisp and juicy, and they had lichee which was bomb. 
    For dessert there were so many things it was hard to see what they didnt have. I ate crepe and ice cream. Also some rugula or however u spell that stuff. The crepe was really good becuase they put strawberries\/peaches and glaze on up with chocolate. By the end of the meal i got so full it hurt to breathe. 
   Overall this place was the best buffet i went to. Aladdin, thanks for the food and freeing the genie.",2,2,1

Many of the items did not impress me.  Sushi selection is dismal, one item?  Come on!  They need to take down the sign claiming to be the #1 buffet in Vegas!  They are not even close!

I did enjoy the prime rib and potatoes.  The crab legs were average.  The Middle eastern food was good as well.  I enjoyed the Humus, tabouleh, lamb.  The chicken was a bit dry so get some sauce for it.  Soup selection was poor.  We tried a number of desserts and most were OK.  I liked the souffle.  I doubt I will return.

We usually only go in the morning for Brunch as you can get both breakfast and lunch and who doesn't want a little of both?!

Some things, like most buffets, lack some flavor but for the most part everything tastes so good and is always presented fresh. I think people forget that these places can't over season everything as they are trying to cater to everyone's needs. Some like extra salt, some like their food with almost none so they do what they can. They are making mass amounts of food so expect some things to be under seasoned. You always add more at your table with the salt and pepper shaker. :)

My favorite thing to do is get they're Mac-N-Cheese and add bacon to it. Then I go grab some bread sticks from the side where they are serving the pizza. I then dip the break sticks into the mac-n-cheese sauce and it is delish! Is it carb over load? Duh....but who's counting on Vacation in Vegas?? Plus you need the bread to help soak up all the alcohol you are consuming while you're eating. You don't want to get too tipsy before the start of your day!

They're desert station is amazing as you can get cotton candy, strawberry shortcake, ice cream...you name it! I would recommend this place to anyone looking to enjoy a delicious brunch that gives you a little taste of places from all over the world. I don't think you will be disappointed.

I bumped the stars to 5 because they are prompt on filling up your glasses with the alcohol you paid for and that just makes a great start your day. ;P",2,0,0

We actually got in pretty quick, waited maybe 5 minutes. Space is a little cramped, none of the food items ran out while I was there. I tried a little of everything and the general consensus was bland. 

The miso soup tasted off, not exactly what you expect from it. Sauteed veggies needed flavor, mac n cheese was decent but needed bread crumbs or something to kick it up. The pastas were bland, curry cauliflower needed more spice, the premade salads were overdressed and not in a good way. The lasagna was mostly just ground meat without enough cheese to actually balance it.

I'd say the things I actually liked were the stuffed sole, the mashed potatoes, and the mac n cheese since the sole was actually tasty and the other two had easily fixable issues. Black pepper seemed to be the easiest way to go about it really.

Unfortunately, Spice Market didn't deliver.  First, while eating the food, I watched the chefs use their bare hands to transfer food from dish to dish (yes, the food you eat!)  Generally, I'm not a big complainer, but when you go from ready to serve food, to your dish towel, and back to ready to serve food...I'm less than thrilled.  Next, I watched the same chef take food OFF of a customer's plate, and place it back into the serving line! Oh my! Glad I didn't eat the prime rib, because she served the SAME piece back to ANOTHER customer!

As for the food? More than half of what I ate was cold, or lukewarm at best.  I actually had my waitress test the sliders, as it was still mostly frozen! Such a waste!

Also, for a place with such good reviews on the desserts, I can't say that I was at all impressed.

Sitting out too long, or just not enough liquid in the mix? Not sure. The Mexican, again, the taco meat was on the dry, overcooked side. Most buffets the taco meat is way too oily\/juicy. This the complete opposite. The carving station had very good prime rib. Desserts were also on the good side. Nice variety. Good soft serve ice cream. Being Diamond level we were ""treated"" to a special fish dish which was very tasty.

Their grilled vegetables--yellow squash, eggplant, carrots, red onion, and asparagus were all very tasty and grilled just right.  I like their split crab legs and the peeled shrimp.

I have always like the Spice Market's cheese tray.  I had some nice pieces of bleu cheese this evening to enjoy with dinner.

Then I turned my attention to the Middle Eastern section where I had some lamb kebabs, chicken kebab, and hummus.  I enjoyed them all.

Finally, dessert.  For the first time at this buffet, I had their made to order crepe.  I tried the Bananas Foster.  It's semi hand made as the crepes are pre-made.  The cook heats the crepe in a pan and adds whatever filling you want from a nice selection, folds it, and puts any topping on it you want.

Service was excellent.  The server brought me a new glass of iced tea before I was finished with the one I had.

The snow crab legs were nasty---didn't even get one or try it.  All the other food looked like what ever...this only got 2 starts instead of 1 star, because I liked the ""middle eastern"" section.  However, I went here thinking I was going to have some crab legs.

Everything in the middle eastern section was pretty good: curry was delish, hummus was good, pieces of beef, lamb, & chicken were o.k. (some were good).  The pieces of meat were a bit cold  All the other sections just didn't look good.

Ambiance\/atmosphere: 6 - The atmosphere was okay. Lots of people and we sat in the corner, which was nice. However, it felt much like being in a cafeteria and that detracted a little from our experience.

Service: 5 - The waitress would come pick up our plates occassionally but with a large party they stacked up quickly. However, each time she came by, she was very friendly, as was the rest of the staff.

First I was told to get the coupon from those little books, they run a buy one get one free, so that helps with the cost.  Line to get in is so long, but moves pretty fast.  

The place is comprised to stations of so many nationalities, it was overwhelming!  Mexican, Indian, Chinese, American, Italian, Dessert, etc.

The salad and Mexican taco\/burrito bars were standard but had quite a bit of brown lettuce. The macaroni and cheese was flavorful and creamy and I did enjoy this.

We avoided this buffet for months, thinking it was this crowded all the time. We went Halloween night and there was NO ONE in line. I was told this was a ""slow"" season.

We are Total Rewards (players card) members and expected to pay $27.99 each, minus the Groupon credit. However, the ""NEW PRICING"" prices noted on the website menu http:\/\/bit.ly\/1u7By0S were not the actual prices. The cashier said the prices increased, and in fact they increased a few hours before we arrived. Our new price for Total Rewards members was $29.99 plus tax. That was a bit disappointing, and we suggested they update the website immediately.

Total of $77.76 for buffet for two wasn't a great value overall (we get free buffets often at Silverton, The M, and Stations Casinos), but I suppose our fault for buying the Groupon not knowing the lines would be so long at the time we wanted to be there in the first place.

Service was good. Food selection was all good and tasty except for the baklava which was stiff. The chardonnay house wine was very cheap and sugary in my opinion. I would not do the all-you-can-drink next time. Better to buy a quality glass of wine in the casino and bring it in.

There was a photographer taking those ""tourist"" photos and trying to sell a pair of pics for $20. We didn't care for that, and we didn't appreciate that she assumed we were tourists. Locals like us are just as much of the clientele around this town.

Champagne Brunch - What more could you want? It's breakfast, lunch, dessert, and booze. You can stay as long as you want, which means you can drink as much as you want for a great price. The food is good, and if you pass a chip or two to your drink server the drinks will flow freely.

Breakfast - Breakfast for two cost about as much as Starbucks for two. If you in that hung over state of not knowing exactly what it is you need to eat to feel better, this is a good bet. You can have coffee, oj, water, and all the breakfast fare you want. So if you take a bite a something that just doesn't do your tummy right.... no biggie, toss it aside and move on to the next item on your plate.

Shrimp Tempura was pretty good.  I went back and got seconds.

Italian Meatballs - I had one that was really good, but then the next one was really really salty.  Bad batch I guess.

The restrooms were in a weird place.  They were located near the entrance before the registers.  So you had to leave the buffet area to go to the restrooms, and there was this weird elevator there.  I'm not sure where that went.

We ended up paying about $23 a person before tax to eat here and that is with ""unlimited drinks"" included. I put that in quotes because let's be real, how do you unlimited drinks when there's unlimited food--it just won't all fit.

Things to eat - Mediterranean station (I actually liked everything I ate here! Esp the lamb and grilled zucchini!!), thai eggplant at the Asian station, Buffalo popcorn shrimp at the seafood station, mac&cheese and the roasted chicken at the American station.

Things not to eat - sushi (this freaked me out bc there were like 3 types tossed in a bin together...), most of the pastas (blah taste, not worth the carbs), anything at the asian station (ie the calamari), or ANY OF THE WINES. I'm pretty sure the all you can drink wine was franzia or something similar, and you will feel a hangover coming on as you drink it.

In my humble opinion, this place is only popular because of the hotel and not for the food.

To reiterate, the food was either bland or salty. Thankfully, we had the Buffet of Buffets deal for $45.99 (after the $5 discount for being a total rewards member) and we got to eat at 6 different buffets within 24 hours. So for the price of it being Buffet of Buffets, it was only okay. If I had to pay for the original dinner price, I would be quite upset right now. Do not pay full price would be my best advice. It simply isn't worth the price!

About the food, only 3 things really made my trip a little better:
-the fruits (lame right?)
-the middle eastern food section as many have mentioned was good
-the cotton candy (wow! this was the only buffet I know that offered cotton candy!)

I was happy to find that they had Middle Eastern food, which is not common in buffets.  I tried the Tandoori chicken and it had good flavor (but a little dry).

My friend said the Kung Pao Chicken from the Asian food area was really good (I didn't try it because I can't eat spicy food).  I liked the little baked char siu pork buns.  The Crab Rangoons were way too salty though.  The Egg Drop Soup was good, but it's hard to go wrong with that.

You walk in and you are literally surrounded by all the different sections of food. All sections are as follows, salad, Mexican, soup, middle eastern, American, Asian, Italian, seafood, and dessert, told you there are a lot. On top of all the different types of food they do have some unique foods that my girlfriend noticed right away artichoke hearts, grape leaves and tabbouleh. 

When entering this buffet you will notice the dim ambiance. It has sort of an intimate feeling. The seating is nice, feels more like a restaurant then a buffet honestly. I do enjoy how spread out the food was. If I remember correctly the buffet bar took up three walls.

Lots of food, nice seating, many different varieties of food, and comfortable environment make this buffet a safe bet.

The Mexican station was decent. You could make fajitas or nachos. The guacamole was questionable... You couldn't see any avocado pieces, maybe I just like it a bit chunky.

the difference between this buffet and all the others: you can get your crab legs steamed!!! now if seafood is not you're thing, then i guess this wouldn't be the place for you. i love my crab legs with lemon, most like it with tons of butter, but i feel that takes away from the crab.

here's my buffet run through:
once you're at your table, either wait for your waiter\/ress and order your drinks, or head on off! i like to do a walk through first, start on one end, and make your way to the other. when you reach one end, this is when you grab a plate, and start filling it with the foods you liked and want to try.

i like a cup of soup, salad, pasta with big chunks of tomatoes, something fried, mashed potatoes, prime rib, fish, i love their mediterranean section, etc. for my first round, i usually come back with 2 plates.

second round, re-try anything i just loved, and try new things that i couldn't fit on my first 2 plates.

third course: seafood!!! shrimp with cocktail sauce, anything fried, and crab legs galore!! and wait in that line to get them steamed. perfection, my friends, is more than worth the wait. make sure to grab some lemons for the extra kick! and butter, if you like that stuff.

last course: dessert. now i'm not a big dessert person, but i will indulge myself in some yummy goodness when it's a buffet.

There was waffles, french toast, pancakes, smoked salmon station, scrambled eggs, and  oatmeal as well as hash browns. The pancakes were blah but the waffles and french toast were passable.

They offered Asian, American, seafood, Italian, salad bar, and a dessert bar. I'm certainly forgetting 1 or 2 of them. Never seen that many islands for one buffet of any kind... anywhere.

The price is far from a deal ($23-$25); however, it really doesn't cost any more than a good meal would anyway. For about $50, you can get 24 hour access to the buffet down to the minute. So stop by at 2 pm for a late lunch and get 4 meals in without feeling the need to stuff your face each time.

The salad bar was not quite as good as it could have been given how much they have of everything else, but certainly not awful as someone else indicated.

Tacos,Quesadillas,Tortillas, Guacamole and Salsa

Ham and Prime rib

Shrimp Cocktail, Sushi (again i wouldnt recommend),Crab legs

Eggrolls, Noodles and Dim sum

Cookies

1. The Spice Market Buffet is located in Planet Hollywood, in the middle of their casino floor, and down an escalator.

2. There are any choices for food, but the idea is to feature the world as a smorgasbord.

I remember heading down the escalator to the Spice Market, while thinking to myself, what the hell why is there a buffet underground? Anyways, I digress, the food here is pretty sub-par. There are many better destinations to choose, and the crowd here sort of shows it.

The one thing that I can say about their food is forgettable. I don't even recall a single item that I really liked. The crab legs that they have at the place were decent. For some reason, they don't feel as fresh as the crab legs at even the Bay Buffet or even stack  up to the Bacchanal Buffet.

The other thing that I noticed is that the food from different parts of the world seemed to vary in quality. Either they were decent representations or they were horrible misrepresentations. As a controlled test, I try the Asian themed stations at every buffet to see what they get right. Here, I think everything that they put out didn't even stack up well to everything else.

The Spice Market Buffet is just as expensive as the Bay Buffet or even other places along the strip. I guess for the value it isn't that bad, but the idea here is pretty much more options, less quality.",1,0,0

Now that was not a plug for Harrah's in fact... they probably hate me for sharing such great news to everyone!  If you do the math, each of the buffets on the strip now cost at least $15.99 even breakfast... now throw in already expensive buffets such as the Le Village Buffet at Paris, Rio Buffet, and here, Spice Market.... you are pretty much getting each buffet below the $15 threshold... isn't that terrific money saved for the slots? 

Ok ok, I'll stop the sidetracking and stay on course.....(no wonder my reviews are so annoying long?  LOL!)

Spice Market Buffet is located in Planet Hollywood.  (By the way, unless you know Planet Hollywood's location or have seen the sign from far away, you wouldn't know if you stand in front of it.  They don't have any signs showing that is Planet Hollywood except with ""Miracle Mile Mall"" and ""Casino"" posted above their entry way...(My buddy was confused on where he was at but I was able to guide him thru)

Once entered, you get into a line so that you can then be prompted to get into the ""real"" buffet line downstairs.  The Spice Market Buffet used to be Arabian themed but since the take over of Hollywood you will now see posters of movies hanging on the walls.  Not as nice as before as they are trying to be more sophisticated.

Food here really is pretty good.  To me, it's one of the much better ones located in the central strip area.  They had Salads, Mexican, Asian, Seafood, Mediterranean, Italian, and a nice dessert section.  

My highlights were the following...  Lamb Kabobs... fresh off the grill dipped in tzatziki sauce.... wonderful pairing as the kabobs were slightly salty which balanced out perfectly with light yogurt\/cucumber sauce.  Very refreshing!  However, I'm not a big fan of these grill meats because they tend to be a bit dry compared to the likes of other kabobs (such as Satay or izakaya), but my buddy thought it was one of the better ones he's had so I'd take his word for it.  It is very flavorful though.
Got some prime rib with Mushroom Rougut... man... did I ever tell you how much I love mushrooms?  It had the best firm texture these mushrooms which I was so addicted to.  Pairing with a tender prime rib is definitely out of this world.. (I then went back and got a bowl of mushroom only!  Please do not miss the mushrooms if you ever go here!  You will thank me for this!)  

Had some salads as I needed to increase my veggie intake, and overall veggies were veggies... nothing special to discuss here but they are fresh!  Had it with thousand island dressing which is always yummy!

Now onto the main portion.. seafood... 

Fried sole was absolutely jammin!  Imagine actual fish n chip except the fish is definitely not over battered, and the meat if full and juicy!  If you get a plate of say 6 pieces with some fries, you got your $11 worth already!  They did a great job with their fried fish!
My buddy had the buffalo popcorn shrimp as I missed out on it.  He really enjoyed the kick that is added to the crunchiness which is a good pairing.  Very inventive for a buffet as you usually only see straight up deep fried shrimp.

Now onto my favorite dish of them all, a wrapped filet of sole wrapped around crab filling.  For those frequent readers of my reviews, do you remember my experience at Le Village buffet in Paris and the rose filet of sole?  Remember how much I loved that?  Well.... this just topped that because it's near identical except now it's got crab fillings... It's like eating a rose of sole ravioli, then once you bite into it you've just entered the crab cake dimension... OMG delicious!!!  

Now you see why I didn't get to more items?  I got stuck on the sole and never turned back.........  

I did have a little bit of dessert though... Fresh strawberry tart, Tiramisu (not what I've had in the past which was the only disappointment), and a really cool cotton candy station where everyone can take a cotton candy to go!!!  Kids absolutely love it!

So if you are in Vegas, I strongly recommend you get the 24hr pass (so you have access to the buffet anytime your heart desires \/ also save money), and visit the Spice Market Buffet.  One great tip... if you want to visit the Paris Buffet, anticipate a nice long wait or you must go early.  If you just simply walk over next door to Spice Market in PH, you will notice that the line is half of the size and also the service is much more faster because Paris moves at the speed of a snail.....  You are in Vegas and every second matters as all the fun and excitement are calling your at all times... Make a smart choice!",15,10,14

I really liked this one because of its wide layout & full selection - To me, it seemed longer\/ larger in size than most other Vegas buffets... Meaning that the various kitchens were seen stretched out across a huge plain in a way that actually took some time to get through 
Luckily, we spent some time walking around the shops in the Miracle Mile before coming here, to make sure were hungry & super ready once we got started :p
As far as the food options here, I found that there were plenty of non-meat dishes alongside the meat ones, so it was, i.m.o., an acceptable buffet for someone with a Vegetarian diet (and perhaps somewhat accommodating for a Vegan). The title categories in this buffet include, Seafood, Salad (on both ends of the room), Italian, Asian, American, Mid-Eastern, & Mexican. The Seafood seemed traditional (Paella, crab legs, stuffed fish, sushi, etc.) but very decent in presentation, Salads were mostly prepared mixes, next to some free toppings & leaves, & the rest housed all the usual\/ popular items you'd expect: pizza, pasta, lasagna, dried meats & cheeses, lo mein, fried rice, Thai eggplant, egg rolls, dumplings, fried chicken + biscuits, steamed vegetables, prime rib, (mashed and au gratin) potatoes, tabbouleh, hummus, stuffed grape leaves, curry, naan, curried cauliflower, lamb, & veggie kabobs, rice, beans, tacos, tamales, quesadillas, salsa, guac, & other toppings, with tons of bread! I found almost all the food I tried to be pretty good but I specifically went back for the eggplant, curry sauce, & veggie kabobs more than once :)
I was, however, sad to find that the soup (both Miso & Tortilla varieties) were way too salty for my taste, even though I love salt & I love soup! lol I was also disappointed with the Dessert table, as it strongly lacked creativity or any sense of variety compared to all the other buffets I've been to. Besides the watery bread pudding & some nasty-looking, canned fruit crumble thing, there were not many other plates laid out. I saw crème brûlée, mini cheesecakes, small parfaits, & ice cream but other than those... there was nothing more than 10 different kinds of cupcakes. For the cupcakes, they had some very simple flavours like Mint Choc Chip, Chocolate Raspberry, Cannoli, Bananas Foster, Strawberry Shortcake, Keylime Pie, S'mores, & Cookies + Cream... which may sound good to some people but I would have liked to see something other than cupcakes... Since it is a buffet & people will most likely be returning to the dessert bar more than once, I think they would do better with a bigger selection (i.e. fruit, custards, cakes, brownies, & other crap that people only allow themselves to eat on vacation :p). However, they do offer a ""Chef's Special Selection"" that I'm guessing they change frequently, which happened to be some pre-cooked (then reheated) crêpes w\/ nutella & sugared-bananas that night

We came around 10 p.m. (1 hr before closing) on Sunday night & were treated very well in the V.I.P. section - Plates cleared often, drinks constantly refilled, social\/ talkative waitress, & ALL food items present & filled as if it was still an early dinner hour... So we really enjoyed ourselves at this buffet & would easily return even with our plans to make our way through all the others on the strip :D",0,0,0

It USED TO have such fresh food and variety and such amazing dessert selections....

What a darn disappointment these last couple of times and this last time just threw me over the top.

The food has become merely edible but oh so tasteless and hardly any fresh food! I mean, we pay for dinner price yet we eat the same crap as you served lunch hours ago? Uh, I don't think so.

$20 for the buffet, and you're in.

Kind of bummed that there's no crab legs or prime rib, but oh well. I didn't expect it to be there for such a low price.

Buffet food is subject to being dried out\/unfresh after sitting under a heat lamp for a few hours, and some of the food was definitely suffering as a result.

But, some of the highlights: shrimp, loaded potato skins, burger sliders, tandoori chicken, enchiladas, and (wait for it...) the crème brulée. The crème brulée was such a pleasant surprise.

While Spice Market has its ups, it's a more mediocre buffet on The Strip. I give it a firm ""meh,"" but I'd be willing to give it a second chance if there was a coupon.",8,8,6

My husband and son had been to Vegas last year for a car show and bought the wrist band that gives you access to more food than you need and putting that wrist band on is almost like accepting a challenge to make it pay big, so at least if you lose all your money in the casino, by God you will make it up on that wristband of 'all you can eat'. Challenge accepted. 

We did learn we could have shown our Harrah's card and gotten the wristbands for $44. We paid $55. Not sure why, but the next morning the woman told us they charge different prices at different times with no explanation, but with the Harrah's club card, its the cheapest. 

Now we REALLY wanted to make it pay. It is true you get sick of buffet food by the next day. My husband took us here because last time they were here, everyone said this IS the best buffet. Honestly, they really do all taste the same.

However, it is still moderately priced, and the food is delicious. The quality is still far, far better than that of the Rio or all of the station casino buffets which all completely blow, by the way. 

I will have to say, with deep regret that the food isn't as good as it used to be. I don't know what happened. Since they went from being the Aladdin to Planet Hollywood, something changed, and it hurts me deep inside. Maybe because the people who own these places are more focused on catering to disgusting, sweaty pigs that frequent the club scene? ""Yay let's get trashed and get our makeup all smeared and let's go barefoot so our feet look like we've been walking through tar and then guys will all love us and marry us!"" I'm certain this is the mentality of these pigs.

Anyway. Dear Spice Market Buffet and Planet Hollywood, please bring the quality we all used to love back. The service has gone to bleeding hell, and the selection just doesn't saturate my mouth with saliva like it used to.",0,0,0

Now it's just a little bigger than snow crab legs.  Epic fail!  The quality and selection of food had really gone down the drain.  I've eaten here since the first year aladdin was built. Way back in early 2000.  It's a shame.  For 27.99 I could have spent a few dollars more and have gone to Wynn.  It's really generic buffet food.  It really reminds me of Rio's buffet.

I was hungover as all hell from going to The Double Down bar the previous night.  I did not want to eat, but knew that I needed to.  A couple of skinny friends mentioned this place but I'd always brushed them off.  Who trusts skinny people when it comes to good buffets?  But it was the closest buffet to our hotel, so we went and holy moley was it the best decision a couple of hungover kids could have made.

I started out small with a salad since that's usually what my hangovers require of me.  Best salad I've ever had.  I can't be sure it was because it cured my hangover or the salad was, in fact, the best salad I've ever had.  But enough of the lettuce, EVERYTHING was good.

The price was not bad (under 15 bucks for breakfast) and they had a great selection of food.  I even had a bunch of shrimp tempura with my breakfast...how cool is that?  The food would more than likely get a 4 in my book.  Our waitress was a delight...she had a great attitude and was able to take care of our whole group.  

My one big complaint is about the group reservations...once we knew what time the wedding was (a couple weeks before) we started trying to contact people at the hotel to get a group reservation.   Both myself and my mother-in-law called person after person and number after number.  We were told people would be calling us back and that they would figure it out for us.  We seriously got a huge runaround trying to make a reservation...it was very frustrating.  We finally got somewhat of a reservation a couple days before but when we showed up in wedding dresses and suits with like 30 people it was a big huge production with them trying to figure out what to do with us.  

Also to top it off we were told we had to be done by a certain time...like we had to be out of the buffet at a specific time.  Remember this was after our wedding and I am sorry if we wanted to hang out and talk and celebrate.  I think they gave us a hour and a half total before we had to leave for another group.

Not the best impression on an otherwise magical day.

PERFECTION.  We stumbled upon their special ""Memorial Day Weekend Brunch"" -- how lucky were we!!!

Although there were a few glitches here and there -- most of which have already been enumerated by many a Yelper prior -- the good points definitely more than greatly outweighed the bad ones.  Let's go with our basic Pros vs. Cons list.

PROS:  most food is freshly placed out on a consistent basis; overall the buffet lines don't ever seem to be insanely crowded (and we came on a Saturday lunch\/holiday weekend); the seafood newburg (sp?), raw oysters, crunchy shrimp tempura, ""casino clams"" (trust me, they're garlicky and delightful!) and PILINGS of crab legs were absolutely delish; the Italian's station's gnocchi and osso bucco were incredibly tasty; the prime rib and bbq meats over at the American station were melting in my mouth; the tabbouleh, falafel, and mint au jus (not all together) at the Mid-Eastern station was most excellent; the flour tortillas at the Mexican station were definitely freshly made; the sushi rolls didn't have too much rice wrapped around them; our server was kind and quick, and she kept our champagne and OJ filled to the brim; the made-to-order crepes were to DIE for and capped off a perfect afternoon of gorging and gluttony-ing.

CONS: $3 extra if you want the champagne (although I guess $3 for AYCD isn't really THAT bad, but considering that at most places here in Vegas it comes with the brunch); a somewhat slow-moving seafood line due to the fresh steaming of the crab legs and a slightly disorganized server behind the counter (suggestion: grab small bites like the sushi or small Asian fare while waiting in line); salads were described in a yummy fashion but didn't look that appetizing; Mid-Eastern ""tandoori"" chicken and lamb were slightly dry, tough, and game-y, and the pita bread was a bit hard; Maryland crabcake benedict a bit of a disappointment; was too filled to my brim to try other things I wanted (like the make your own Belgian waffle, make your own omelet, soups, etc.); lobster ravioli at the Italian station was a bit salty, as was the BBQ sauce on the pork ribs at the American place; Asian selections didn't look appetizing at ALL; and finally although the wait was only about a half hour total at most, there is an intimidating-looking line starting in the casino, then you finally get through and down an escalator to...  another snaking line!  bummer.

BUUUT, bottom line is that the Spice Market Buffet is TOTALLY worth it all -- the wait, the occasionally rude buffet goer-slash-tourist (plus, it was UFC weekend, so trust me, more than one brutish UFC-shirt-donning sumbitch cut in line and\/or attempted to exchange words with me and\/or my brother while at this establishment), and the sometimes hit-or-miss with the selections.  However, hello?  It IS a buffet and the odds are that you will find something here that you'll enjoy.  Since the food is so fresh, the service is so great, and the overall vibe is clean and customer-friendly, you just won't be able to go wrong here even if you tried.

P.S.  There was a wedding reception going on too (only a handful of guests though, about 20ish, so it wasn't intrusive or anything).  But I have now found my inspiration to get married -- I want my reception here at the SMB!",2,0,1

This was a solid option aside from the long wait that we experienced to get a table. We were disappointed to peek over the wall and find entire sections of 10-12 dirty tables with one busser slowly working each table, as we stood and waited for a place to sit. The drink servers\/table clearers do hustle but they are likely overwhelmed with the amount of tables they have. Our server kept up on drinks once we were able to order them.

Our group didn't do the drink package as we didn't feel it was needed or worth it. 

The food? It was just fine.. split crab legs, prime rib that was tasty and not chewy, good fried chicken and plenty of salad options\/toppings. They tried to do a little of this, and a little of that.. but it's possible that their quality diminishes because of it - ie. Sushi. Sushi shouldn't be on the buffet unless it's an entire station of just sushi and it's made fresh in front of you by a sushi chef. One platter of sushi on the seafood spread is a little scary to me. 

Desserts were all delish.. we had cupcakes and cotton candy and ice cream, as well as flan, mousse cups and more.

While in line, I chatted with the ladies in front of me who indicated that they'd been at the buffet a couple of years ago and it was good. I had hope! It's not horrible.. but it's not like some of the top rated buffets on the strip. Of course, it wasn't $65 for a meal either.. :)",2,0,2

The Italian,  Mexican, salad bar and seafood stations were predictable, lasagna, chicken piccata, pizza, tacos, nachos, fajitas quesadillas, crab legs, shrimp, seafood salad etc. What I enjoyed was being able to try new things like the middle eastern cuisine with dolmas, cous cous, lamb, etc.  The prime rib from the American station was excellent and the mashed potatoes were superb, just like grandma used to make when I was little.  I must admit my favorite station was the dessert station. They had about 10 different types of flavored cupcakes in addition to various pastries, like cannoli, baklava and tarts.  They also had a frozen custard station with various toppings. The raspberry tart was fantastic, I must admit I had more than one.  The wait staff was courteous and thanked us on leaving for the tip.

We must have gone on a really bad day. I will list the reasons for the 1 star and why I would NEVER recommend this place: 

1. waited in a long line. not surprising considering we are in a vacation mecca BUT there were more used empty tables than ones being used by patrons. 

2. we were surrounded by said dirty tables the entire time we were there.

3. our server greeted us by telling us we were going to be angry...why? because they only had tea and lemonade available, no soda. not a problem for me, I prefer tea...asked if it was fresh brewed, not, it was a mix. now yes, I was miffed. then angry when I tried it...pure disgusting swill. 

3. we arrived around noon. I walked around looking before choosing. Looked at the soups. They still had oatmeal. From breakfast. Just gross.

4. food was just ok. really no better than your average, inexpensive buffet. the desserts looked fabulous, both pics and live...they were just thawed out items like you have in a chinese buffet. nothing special at all and certainly not worth the calorie splurge.

5. my calorie splurge was going to be the cotton candy...I am like a 5 yo with that stuff...Love, Love, Love it...they did not have it. Was told they did not have the sugar. 

6. Table service was almost non-existent.

7. I really think most of these issues were due to being way understaffed...both table wise and cooking wise. So many items were obviously not being replenished and kept fresh. I overheard a patron asking asking the hostess (whom she had to get up and approach) when their drink order would be taken because they had been there quite awhile. 

8. I honestly think that because we were on vacation, I was going to overlook all of this and try to think back on this as not too horrible. Until I went to a downtown buffet that I will review here as well. That cost less than half of what we paid here and was one thousand times better. Just unbelievable.",1,1,0

The food itself was good, and this buffet had lots of options. However, the service was abysmal. You have to write your drink order on a card instead of telling the waitress. We didn't know that, and we waited a while for the waitress to arrive. Once she did, we didn't have our card ready so she just left.

We were able to get a great deal on Groupon for 4 people at $75 and it was well worth it.

I can definitely appreciate that all the food types visibly  labeled throughout the buffet but this layout made searching for good exhausting. I practically didn't realize there was an entire other half of stuff available until my husband kept returning to the table with new items that I had misssd. When we finally sat at our table I was on my second plate before a waiter finally showed up. He showed up while I was chewing my food and noticed it was taking me a bit so he decided he was going to continue to a different table.  This just about pissed me off and I had to flag him back to our table. After this initial encounter he never came back to check on us.

Yes, they have crab legs. Pardon me if I don't get all a-twitter over that. Lots of buffets have crab legs. I actually think the best dish I had was the salmon with a soy glaze. That was actually quite delicious. 

Despite the fact that it's a buffet, I still like to get some salad with my meats, and I thought the salad fixings here were minimal. (Most were prepared salads, not raw salad fixings.) Kind of disappointing. 

Chinese food selection was shady looking, so I didn't go there. Mediterranean section was very nice, although I think the baba ganoush was a bit off. 

Prime rib was ok (much better at the Golden Nugget, if you can believe that) and the dessert section was also just okay. The yams were fabulous!

If you're going to do buffets while in Vegas, maybe get the ""buffet of buffets"" pass (around $45, I think) which gives you 24 hours of buffet eating at any of the Harrah's properties. If you hit 2 buffets in 24hours, it takes the sting out of the prices. If you aren't going to hit 2 buffets in that 24 hours, don't do it. (Also, now that there's no buffet at Bally's you may see more traffic at Spice Market and Paris .. so be prepared for lines at peak dining times.)",1,1,1

Just don't make this buffet your last buffet for the Buffet of Buffets especially if you're in a time-crunch.  I came here with about 40 mins left on my 24-hour Buffet pass and almost didn't make the cut because the line was long and it took them forever to seat everyone, even though there were TONS of tables on the seafood side.

Unfortunately for me, because of the Buffet of Buffets, I wasn't that hungry.  But it's ok because seafood doesn't really fill you up.  So I went on an all out crab legs binge.  I do love the crab legs there: snow crab (which means those large crab legs with huge pieces of meat and not the scrawny ones you normally see in crappy buffets) and they're cut in half so you can easily extract the meat from the legs.  Yummmmm....

The shrimp cocktail is also peeled for you so that's a plus since I can't stand peeling shrimp.

As for the prime rib, I really didn't pay that much attention to it.  I had 1 slice and I still don't think it's as good as Paris' Le Village Buffet's prime rib.

It is one of the few buffets in Vegas to offer Middle Eastern food.  I do not recommend the baklava, if you want authentic.  It is overly sweet.  It doesn't taste bad, but it wasn't what I was craving.  

Some of the foods are hit or miss.  Some of the chicken dishes, for example, are extremely tender and flavorful, and some are dry and bland.  Luckily, they don't seem to charge extra even if I leave their tasteless food on the plate.  

I got the shrimp tempera right as they put it out, and it was delicious.  I don't usually eat tempera when I go to restaurants because the oil is reused so much, it leaves a nasty taste, and it isn't a good crispy texture, but this one was crisp and delicious.  It was the best I've ever had, even compared to non-buffet restaurants.

It has some unique dishes as well.  They had ribs cooked with a black pepper sauce on the outside so that it was crispy on the outside.  It was interesting.  They also had meatballs with breadcrumbs around the outside creating a crispy exterior.

They also have a lot of the foods Le Village Buffet in Paris has.  For example, they have the same breads, but more.  They have the same cheeses.  They have the same meats, but more like the stuffed sole fillet.  And best of all they have the frozen custard.

The crepe station here just gets premade crepe skins and reheats it with butter. 

Also, when I when, the cuts of meat on the carving station seemed better at Le Village, compared to Spice Market.

Overall, this and Rio are my favorites from the Buffet of Buffets.",2,0,0

Yes, they have different stations for different styles of food and they have a vast array of desserts and drinks. However, I found the food was quite bland-garlic bread was flavorless,pizza was too.

The salad bar was okay, as were the bread and cheese selections they had. The tandoori chicken and the hammus were tasty. The oval rasberry cheesecakes were excellent.

Spice Market isn't a bad choice, but it wouldn't be my first choice for a good meal in Vegas (no buffet is, actually).  But Spice Market has a huge assortment of ok food.

Food that I can remember:

Crab legs
Can't mess this up, as long as they serve this I'm happy.  They're cold, btw.

Caesar salad
Good but not fresh

Homemade piza
One bite of this is all you need, not good at all

Asian station
Egg rolls were great, pot stickers were ok, drunken noodles had almost no heat (makes sense if feeding many people with different tastes) but that didn't stop me from going back for seconds, good kung pao chicken.

American stuff
Turkey and prime rib with an attentive carver (both good), BBQ pork ribs were really fatty and the BBQ sauce was too sweet and tomatoey, sliders were decent but the buns weren't fresh and a little hard.

Middle Eastern
Lamb kabobs and chicken kabobs that were pre-kabobed and cut into little pieces.  Both good.  Baklava at this station was also really good.

I passed on the Mexican but they had fajitas!

Desserts
Tried every option but only finished the flan, creme brulee, fruit tarts, and the sugar-full cookie.  Ice cream machine was broken (sad face).",0,0,0

It really was an amazing spread and mostly everything tasted good.  

There is also a lot of space for walking around and the tables aren't squished together like a lot of other buffets.  Not only was there a huge selection of good food, but the restaurant looks brand new and is nicely decorated.  There's a very pleasant atmosphere, everything was wonderfully clean, and the service was good.

We arrived for dinner at 8:30pm and there was a huge line to the point that they were about to turn people away for being near capacity.  We didn't feel like waiting so we paid an extra $20 a person to jump ahead of the entire line and use the VIP entrance.  I recommend doing this to avoid the long line.  We saved ourselves at least 30 minutes of waiting in line.  The dinner buffet had a ton of options.  Lots of seafood (try not to get a table near the seafood section because the smell was overwhelming and I felt bad for the people sitting there), Latin, Italian, and Mediterranean food, sushi, and so much more.

Our server mumbled under her breath about no one telling her she had customers. She was very loud and abrasive. Their beer and wine choices are the basic bottom shelf. They have many stations, however there are only a few items at each one, except the dessert station. The dishwasher was not working well that day, the first plate I picked up had pancakes and gravy from the plate below (full portions), not an appetizing way to start. The salad section just had so few selections, it was not manned. The Indian station was not manned either, 3 vegetarian entrees and tandoori chicken chunks. Asian was a bit better, not manned. The meat carving station....both beef hunks were cooked to death, no life...ugh! There was an attendant. The Italian and Mexican were both weak with no imagination, just blah selections. Desserts - this was very disappointing. It was mostly bready type things. Many of the prettier desserts were a base of dense pound\/sponge cake and then decorated differently. These were not fresh, however there was an attendant who was refreshing items and was able to answer a question. They did have cheesecake, crème brulee and flan which were ok. They did have smoothies on one of the salad bars. Just really really disappointing food. Back to our server. She or no one else cleared our plates during our entire meal, so they stacked up. I met her when I was in line for dessert and asked her for another silverware service and napkin. She complained that she had to go in several directions to get these, but she would TRY....WHAT?? They are all bundled together. My husband just went to the hostess station to get it. We heard her announce that she was off the floor and still had not visited to ask us anything or clear plates, but she was attending other tables in our section. Another server came by to clear plates. After our server left (for a break??) and came back with a different shirt on, she delivered the silverware and napkin I had asked for 20 minutes prior and made some excuse that it was just such an effort to get it. She then noticed that my wine glass was still full and spent 5 minutes trying to convince me to get something else, when I clearly stated no, I was fine. We thought oh no, this is part of the Ceasars total buffet package now and maybe these casinos are just not interested in keeping standards because they have turned them into lower quality troughs....buffets have their reputation, but not so long ago they used to do a really nice job, especially for brunch.

Whilst waiting in this ridiculous line to enter Spice Market. Two men started arguing. One man was with his girlfriend\/wife significant other and the other with his entire family. For some reason Indian man gets mad at Arab dude for being an Arab dude, cause he's loud and letting family members family members cut in, which started the whole thing. So they go to almost throwing blows cause Arab man can't let it go. Says ""I would buy you"" bitch, you're eating at a cheap ass buffer, picking up receipts off the ground trying to get freebies. I saw your sandy ass. Anyway, Security comes calms everyone down, then they seat the Indian man and his significant other first.
Fifteen minutes later Indian man comes walking by with a plate of food while Arab man and family are still waiting and angry. Arab man talks some ish to the guy as he walks by, Indian guy ignores it and smiles. Good for him. So now they go to sit the Arab family down and they put them at a table right next to his opponent. Lmfao what the hell are you thinking Spice Market employee.
So now Arab guy knows where Indian guy is sitting, and starts harassing him there. He said some words as he walked passed, again, calm as a Hindu cow, Indian man did nothing but smile. That's called winning folks. Security asks him about it, I see three guards run over to Arab guy, they're all arguing, but i can tell the situation, they're getting removed.

Most of the food looked and tasted like it was sitting out a long time and\/ or highly picked over.  If you wanted prime rib you typically had to wait yet again in line to get a slice. 

I was excited to hit the dessert station with it's many cupcake options but was almost crying over my extremely dry red velvet cupcake.  The best cupcake I tried was the cannoli cupcake.

The only nice things I can say about this buffet is the price is low-ish and they serve beer and wine.  Otherwise I'd recommend hitting up Mandalay Bay or the Rio buffet for better quality, freshness, and options of food - just as  a buffet should be!",1,0,0

The price at this place is one of the cheapest you can get on the strip. Lucky me, I found a deal in travelzoo which made it almost buy one get one. Awesome! Be sure to check for any deals, I'm sure they always have something. 

Atmosphere is like world buffet, they got almost everything. I feel like it's on a higher scale of hometown but the food is delicious especially the southern food. Everything tasted great for a buffet. We went to another buffet the night before which was triple the price of this place and it was terrible, the food here is way better! 

The prime rib, pasta, salmon, everything tasted great. They also have unlimited alcoholic drinks for an extra 9-11$. Well worth it btw.

Oh! I can't forget about the service! The hostess as well as our server was impeccable!!! The best service I have ever had! Very attentive and kept bringing me drink refills without me having to ask!

The food was pretty decent, lots of selection for certain, but some items I was looking forward to fell flat.  The Chinese food was actually worse than some of the crappy joints I've been searching out in LA (perhaps I need to up all of their reviews from the 2 & 3 stars they get).  They only seemed to have rare prime rib at that station.  While I like bloody prime rib, this was still mooing.  

The real problem is the renovation going on at the Aladdin.  The buffet has moved to a temporary location upstairs (last time I was there is was downstairs from the casino) and everything is served in catering dishes.  It's hard to see the items and the labels aren't very large, so everyone walks along opening each (beautiful, btw) catering dish to see what's inside.  It's a little annoying, and it seems like some of the dining rooms are a little cramped.  The dining room we were seated in had a main walkway to get back to the food but it was so tight that at a couple points only one person could walk through at a time.

I hope the quality returns to my first impression, but regardless of what it does, I'd wait until the renovation is complete before dealing with this one.",0,0,0

For the price of only $25, there was a HUGE selection of food. My favorite foods of the buffet includes huge Alaskan Crab Legs and fresh shrimp cocktails (yum!) They have beautifully decorated desserts that all look sooo good, but my stomach had room for only 2. I had the creme brulee and the tiramisu, and they were absolutely delicious.

From the Middle Eastern food section, I tried the basmati rice, which was really good, grinded lamb stuffed in tomatoes, pita + hummus and kabobs. From the Italian section, I tried some white sauce pasta, pizza loaded with tons of ham, and some other stuff that apparently didn't leave a lasting impression. They also had an Asian and Mexican food section, which were also pretty good.

Save room for dessert, because I was just in awe of all the variety of pretty-colored desserts that they had. If I could, I would have tried every single dessert - but that wouldn't be too good for my body, now would it? :)

We were sitting close to the Asian food area and noticed the server tending to this station was not rotating the food and simply dumping the new food into the old food containers. 

We also noticed the cleanliness in the area was terrible. We observed the person attending this Asian food are using deterrent rags to wipe down the areas and using the same rags to wipe down the spoons that were used to serve the food. We noticed this after we already ate something from this station and hoped we did not get sick from the food. We also noticed the person used something paper like sprayed with oil and held it up to the warming light of the food to create a flame in which he used to light the grill behind him.

If I wanted to spend this much on brunch, I would've gone somewhere better, but no, the people in the group wanted this place. I think we should've questioned her taste buds since she was slightly sick\/congested. 

The place had different stations. There was American, Mexican, Italian, Asian, a Salad station, Seafood, Desserts, and MIddle Eastern, which included Indian food because apparently India is not Asia according to Planet Hollywood. 

The line was quite long, but it was around brunch\/lunch so my party and I waited in line, which didn't seem that long of a wait. Or maybe it didn't seem that long since they had TVs playing a Nets game and people were all about Lin, but I digress. Once we paid, the total came to $31, we had to wait to be seated, which again didn't seem so long a wait. We marked out drink orders on a paper and went off in search of belly fulfilling food. I got the usual breakfast food: eggs benedict, bacon (a lot of it since I don't really eat bacon lol), as well as some fruit and harsh browns. Another plate contained stuff from the Middle Eastern station, like some chicken curry, basmati rice, their lamb stuffed tomato thing, and pita and hummus. Well have to say, I enjoyed the breakfast stuff, aside from the non-runny eggs benedict and was kinda disappointed in the Middle Eastern station. I found the food at that station a bit bland and asking ""Where is the spice that makes this whatever it is suppose to be?!"" 

Luckily there were drinks, although the OJ was a bit warm for my liking. And the mimosas were more like an Orangina than a mimosa. We asked for water, but that didn't come till later. I almost thought the poor server forgot. Anyways, I went back to the buffet to see what else I could eat. I didn't find much too appealing cause I was a bit full, but I soldiered on. I went back for a crepe which was at the dessert station. They didn't have any strawberries (big boo to that!!!) so I settled with cherries topped with chocolate sauce, whipped cream, and powdered sugar. I found it a bit blah; too chocolatey and the cherry filling was a bit off putting for me. 

I got another fruit of plate and found I was more satisfied with fruit than I was with anything else. I could've gotten it and a decent mimosa somewhere else or found better food at other buffets on and off the strip. Aside from the fruit, I liked the cotton candy :)

I have fond memories when the casino was Alladin, before it changed to Planet Hollywood. Over the years, the quality of their food and level of service has declined. 

Recently, we decided to take a spontaneous, gluttony trip to Vegas, hitting a few buffets. Coincidentally, we found a Groupon for a couple of places: Spice Market & Paris' Le Village (which I'll review separately) The deal for the Spice Market includes a bucket of beer (4 bottles of Miller, which normally sell for $7.) 

We arrived around 4pm and were immediately seated. I asked the server if we can substitute the bucket of beer for a couple of cappucinos. She responded the ""caps"" were reserved for VIP's only, but she'll try and speak to management. 

Wow, sounds serious! After 10 minutes, she returns w\/ 2 mugs of half filled liquid with foam and proudly says, "" Management has agreed to let you have these cappuccinos.""  Oh really??? I felt so honored we were allowed to have this coffee drink even though we weren't VIP's. The way I see it, the 2 cappuccinos probably cost them 50 cents to make, thus saving them money over the beer, so management should have come out to thank us. 

Even worse, the caps were the absolute worst I've ever had. After 2 sips, I was done. I've even had cappuccinos made by machines at the Mercedes dealership that were a million times better. If they serve these to VIP's expect them to jump ship to another casino. It would be rather insulting after dropping some cash at this casino and be served this mug of crap. 

On to the food. Surprisingly, the prime rib was very tender and perfectly cooked to a medium rare. A bit of au jus and black pepper made this the highlight of the dining experience. Unfortunately, this is where the compliments stop. Everything else had the quality of something you might find at Hometown Buffet. It wasn't disgusting, but nothing at all was memorable. 

They used to offer many types of desserts and freshly baked, soft cookies. Now, cupcakes. That's it. Cupcakes and a lot of it. It's a 5 year old fad consisting of regular cake batter & heavy, colorful frosting on top to dress it up. I passed. 

Service was less than impressive. They weren't busy, yet our server would walk to her ""area"", point at her designated  tables and shout, "" You OK there?"" Perhaps that was her way of asking if we needed anything. Hmmm.... how about our money back?

- all food is delicious
- attentive staff

- can have a long line

It's similar to other buffets where they have a variety of food from other countries.  They had a middle eastern food section that was pretty good.  The dessert section was paltry compared to Rio's Carnival.  The only thing good was the flan.  

Overall, it's a deal with the 24 hour wristband, but the line is off the chain long. Expect to wait a good hour and a half on Sunday, just like we did.  The service was just not there.

Secondly, the food was disgusting. I would not have even given the food 3 stars. Maybe 2 stars. Poor presentation and selection of deserts. No fresh fruits, only some weird mashed up fruit salads that tasted like they were regurgitated.

Located at one of the Strip's most fabulous, in-demand, and decadently gay hotel & casino, you definitely know how to spice up one's dinner !! For the price, you're like a cheap slut that gives good head !! $30 per person for dinner !! If you have a Total Rewards Members card, you save a few extra bucks. More bang for your buck !! No pun intend...nvm

If you're on the search for this buffet, it's located (not conveniently though since you have to park at the parking structure in the back off of Harmon Street and walk through the shops) in the center of all the action of the casino. There are escalators leading you down to this wonderful eatery.

The line can get long during dinner. We had to wait awhile since everyone & their mothers invaded this place. You 1st pay in line and then you wait for a hostess to seat you. The process can be painful especially when you're hella hungry. Like come on people, get your fatty on and then leave once you're done !! Don't sit and talk !! Or I'ma have to come over & slap you hoe !!

The food is SOOOO GOOD here !! They have various foods from various regions of the world such as Asian, Italian, Mexican, American etc. Whatever floats your boat !! I personally like to attack the seafood 1st...leave no mercy. HAHA I know i probably look like a typical Asian buffet person (you know...the ones that stack plates & plates of seafood and not care bout the ppl behind them) but really.... I AM !! hahahaha feeding to my stereotype. To each their own bitch !!

The quality of the food here is superb !! You won't swallow anything nasty or stale or gross !! Their Italian section is amazing !! Especially the seafood pastas !! Yummm !! Are you drooling yet?

The seafood itself is unbelievable !! For the price that you're paying, you're getting incredible quality of seafood !! King crab legs get restocked over & over & over again !! Mine mine mine !! The Asian section is aiiiiiighhttt. Nothing to drool over. The Mexican section...I have yet to experience since I get too full before I even hit the right side of the buffet. Wahhh

THE DESSERTS !! AHHH there's cotton candy !! That itself is the deal winner for me !! How often do you eat cotton candy !! ....unless you're a Disneyland whore & practically whoring your body to Mickey Mouse for some sugar high. but really...that was the most exciting part about this buffet when I 1st saw the cotton candy !!

Anyways, coming down from my Yelp sugar high...the service is good here !! The waiters clean up your table often so it doesn't look like a barbaric feast. They're also really nice and patient !! Our waitress didn't rush us to finish since they were about to close out for the night so that was really considerate of her !!

So come here to get fat !! Just don't go to the club after. You'll be bloated off your ass & look nasty in that tight dress or dress shirt !!",15,21,16

They had a nice selection. There were 7 bars; a salad bar, mid eastern bar, dessert bar, seafood bar, american bar, italian bar, and asian bar. However, for all the food that was cooked everything was overcooked. I think it was due to the fact that most the entrees were sitting under the heatlamps for hours and not turned over enough. So another dock of 1 star. 

I ordered ginger ale and they didn't have it.. Every restaurant in Vegas should automatically offer Ginger ale because that's the best hang over drink.. So instead I ordered coffee and it was very watered down. Another 1 star dock.

Contrary to other's comments, this is not the same price as the Bellagio buffet. I ate there the night before and it was $36. This was $22. Granted it was brunch, but it only gets up to about $27 at dinner I believe. Nevertheless, the brunch was well worth the money. It was not as elegant as the Bellagio which is my fave, but the variety was great and the flavors were on point. 

They have differen ethnic stations and blah, blah, blah. They had some fun seafood options, the desserts were surprisingly decent even though they didn't look it. All in all, I will definitely be back here because they have great variety and we can't afford to spend $70 on buffets and wait in line for an hour to get in.

The cashier kept questioning me when I tried redeeming my $25.00 voucher offer. (The only reason why I was here). After verifying who I was and my age multiple times, I was then seated at my table in a very isolated section of the restaurant next to where to what seemed to be the dish washing area\/drink refilling station. I came alone, and this just made me feel even lonelier. 
Afterwards I was greeted by a very polite server, who served me my drink. He was very courteous and welcoming, unfortunately I only saw him once......then briefly for a drink refill. After that, everyone was giving me a frown when asking for a refill. Now I was just feeling uncomfortable. 
The food selection was spread out around the restaurant according to the country of origin. If I wanted American food, I was within easy access. If I wanted chicken noodle soup, I would have to make a trek across the restaurant with a very hot plate in hand, with a bunch of people running straight at me.

I'm being slightly generous but these 4 stars make sense in context of the fact that we're talking about a Las Vegas Buffet.   I'm not even comparing this place with Picasso across the street or any ""honest"" restaurant, for that matter.   When one accounts for the fact, though, that this is an all-you-can-eat buffet, Spice Market Buffet should evidently get 4 stars.

Other reviewers have already mentioned this:  They have a wide variety of different cuisines:  Seafood, Salads, Italian, American, Asian, Middle Eastern, Mexican, and Desserts.   This means you can get sushi to start with, then load up egg benedicts, then switch over and get a bagel with lox and cream cheese, then get a quesadilla or some pasta, and finish it up with a couple of desserts.   We didn't get an opportunity to try nearly that many foods here, but this is just to illustrate the variety of foods that they serve.

I started with their lox and cream cheese, incidentally.  The salmon was really extremely good.   I also tasted their egg benedict and their crab benedict, and I gotta say the egg benedict was quite good.   The crab one... only so so.  Their lobster pasta was *SERIOUS* disappointment, as was their sushi.  Let's just say that I didn't even touch the sushi:  my wife got it for me as she knows I love it, but just eyeing the fish, I knew it was probably not even close to fresh and didn't really feel like spending my Vegas weekend puking, so I left it.  The sausage pizza was cooked with a wine-based sauce and was way tastey!   Finally, their dessert selection was astounding.   I had the tiramisu and it really was quite a treat!

$20 a head for sunday brunch... It's pricey, but then again you're gonna eat a lot of different foods and lots of it, so that'll basically be your one meal for the day.   Price-wise, I guess it's worth it.

As far as decor is concerned, it's quite tragic.   I think I've felt more warmth kickin' it at the Ritz Carlton men's restrooms than I did in this place.   It's open seats, very ugly booths... just tragic decoration.

Also, watch out for serious white trash contingency here.   This couple took our table and switched receipts because they apparently weren't pleased with where they'd been placed by the hostess.  Puzzled, I asked the guy who looked worse than a bulldog if he might have mistakenly sat at the wrong table.   He sorta grunted and went back to sucking his food out of his plate.   The guy looked so grungy and smelly I frankly wasn't gonna argue.  Probably sitting back in that chair I'd have caught some nasty disease.    Anyway, that was a bit of a downer on our brunch since both my wife and I felt slightly freaked out at this episode.  We tried to sit as far away from them as we could but, sadly, it wasn't far enough.   So yeah, watch out for the white trash that seems to hang out here.   Then again, most of the other patrons looked normal enough.  Still, looks can be deceiving.",1,0,1

We were on line for 45mins even when we could see there were empty tables because the staff couldn't get them cleaned fast enough and the front of the house couldn't coordinate with the waitstaff.  

When we were finally seated, our waiter was nowhere to be seen.  I saw a waitress, for another table of course, who was carrying a platter of hot towels with lemons on top of them, but I guess those were for patrons who were paying more for their food than we were.

They had a great many different stations, but really, someone thought they were serving Chinese food?  Did anyone even consult a Chinese?  And the seafood, what a laugh.  Do people know that almost all the buffets in Vegas have shrimp and  snow crab legs.  I know it's fashionable to be skinny but I don't want crabs that were on a diet.  My husband says that for all the stink of the seafood, there weren't enough meat on them to compensate.  

We didn't stay around too long.  When we thought about the $70 (including tip) that we paid, we left with a slight tummy ache (and not from a full stomach) but it was better than trying to eat the mush.  There was food spilled all around the stations that no one cleaned up and pasta that came up as one lump when I tried to grab some with the tongs.  It was better to leave than to sit there and get upset.  Never going back there again.",1,0,0

First off, I was really looking forward to the breakfast items (nothing like bacon and eggs and shaking off a hangover).  I went right for the eggs benedict, my favorite.  They looked perfect, until I cut in at least.  Cooked through... no yolk.  WTF?!  This is a brunch staple here!  So, I got some more to try again... no dice... I could have broken a window with the yolk.  Oh well...the bacon was cooked right at least!

Middle Eastern and Sushi are my favorite foods, so I was pysched to see they had both.  The Middle Eastern section was very good.  The meats, grape leaves and hummus all were great.  The sushi was OK.  Nothing fancy, just the basic 3 rolls, but they satisfied my craving for raw fish in the morning at least.

I did not try too much otherwise... I think the overcooked eggs just pissed me the hell off and I lost my will to consume 4X my daily recommended intake of food in one sitting.  As far as service, it was very attentive at least, and the atmostphere was what you would expect for a buffet.

For about the same price I would prefer to go to the Rio Carnival Buffet.. they have a better seafood selection. The seafood selection here is not that great, small crab legs and itty bitty size shrimps. Some of the dishes seems a bit dried and over cooked.

The Spice Market Buffet is not the most expensive, nor the least, but it provides an excellent array and variety of food, and each dish is very good.

There are more elaborate buffets (such as, for example, at The Wynn), but such buffets sometimes try to present dishes such as rack of lamb that just aren't suited for mass quantity daily presentation, and fall short of the finest rack of lamb at say, home or in a restaurant.  

Spice Market doesn't try to do what it cannot do well, and serves international foods from America, Italy, Middle East, Asia and Mexico, and of course including seafood, soups, salads and desserts.  The pizza is from stone fire ovens.  

Lately they implemented a drink machine, so that all drinks are self service, which is fine actually as there is no waiting and everything is available on tap.

I went straight for the seafood as always. scrawny Alaskan king crab legs. Tasted like they were sitting there since last week. Hardly seasoned.
The petite cocktail shrimps were only lying there since last night. i finished a handful of them. Raw oysters were big, juicy and probably should've been cooked instead. A little scared for my stomach after. but fear not, i had no ache!

I had the prime rib next. did not look too appetizing, a little fatty and a little too cooked for my taste. Hmm. I stuck with one piece. The kebabs were dry and hard. The lobster bisque was pathetic. Two spoonfuls and let me proceed to yak.

I got a crepe to order. It was swimming in oil. i took one bite and ate all the strawberries. never in my life had i seen such an unappetising crepe!

I think i pretty much had no appetite after that. The tiramisu wasn't half bad, but nothing to call home about.

At dinner, some of the food was pretty good, like the tandoori chicken, seafood enchiladas, and the barbecue ribs, but most of it was just ok.  The service was decent, but that changed the next day.

At breakfast, food again was mixed quality.  The tri-tip steak was delicious, potatoes were good, fruit was decent, most the other stuff (eggs, pastries etc.) was ok.  But the service was fucking awful; we waited about 10 minutes before our server took our order, and when I needed a refill it took a good 15 minutes before our server came by.  And when my friend asked him to replace her OJ because it was super watery, he gave us attitude and told us there was fresh-squeezed OJ at the buffet (which was not true).  He was a dick, and for maybe the first time ever i didn't leave a tip at all.

Since we came in so late, they were actually switching out the breakfast\/lunch food with the dinner selections.

This is the only one with Indian food and I love Indian food so I was excited.  But I ended up being disappointed.  The chicken curry wasn't as good as I remember when this property was the Aladdin.  (Yes, it's been that long for me.)  The lamb-stuffed tomato offered was also laughable.  It's was just some ground lamb stuck on top of half a tomato.  No one bothered to actually hollow out the tomato and stuff it with anything.

The Mexican station was pretty good.  They had good guacamole.  This buffet also offers real glass ramekins, which are a nice touch.  The rest of the buffets just had disposable plastic cups.

The thin crust pizza was pretty good.  And the condiments were in appropriate locations, which I appreciate.  No hunting around for butter or soy sauce.

But a lot of things were mislabeled - another one of my buffet pet peeves.  Tomato sauce was labeled as curry sauce.  I poured some on my curry chicken, thinking I could get some extra curry sauce.  But no, it was tomato sauce.  Yuck.  I had to start all over to try the curry chicken.

One nice feature in this buffet is the huge restroom.  It's actually clean and quite nice.  Lots of stalls.

Even though I had a good referral from a trusted friend, the scene when I escalated downstairs looked pretty ho-hum, with standard large Strip buffet offerings. Any buffet can get you pregnant, but after a one-hour wait, I demanded that Spice Market pay for my food child's upbringing as well. 

I immediately attacked the crab legs, great start, not quite as good as Wynn. Next the prime rib, best buffet prime rib I've had, period. The Middle Eastern section was terrible - tasteless hummus and dry kabobs. Honey hot wings were nicely crunchy, Italian homemade meatballs good, then back for more crab legs. Salad\/fruit\/cheese offerings for palate cleanse, all fresh. Creme brulee delectable, bread pudding less so. 

Our waiter took awhile to get to us initially, but he was very attentive, which was great since we had unlimited booze on our $25\/pp Travelzoo deal. If we didn't have to wait an hour, which I know isn't unusual for good buffets, I'd have left happier, but if you want to buffet, don't mind the wait, and you get a deal, it really is solid.

They have Mexican, Chinese, Middle Eastern, Italian, a grill, and seafood. Personally I'm a seafood lover so I stuck mostly to seafood but I did try at least one thing from every section. Snowcrab legs like every buffet was the most popular thing on the menu, people were just grabbing plates of them. Sometimes they were hot, sometimes they were chilled which was a little weird. The food is tasty though and we all ate ourselves into a food coma. 

We went at prime dinner time 6 PM and had to wait in line for about 45 minutes. There's a line on the casino floor to take the escalator downstairs to wait in another line. That was a little disappointing to finally get through one line only to go into another. The service is spotty, sometimes no one would pick up our plates until a few had collected, sometimes it was right as we finished.

The only good item was their Belgian waffles.  Went to the Sunday Brunch only because the hotels offer the $5 off per person (I now know why).  But if i had known how bad this place was I woulda said screw the discount.

The food was cold.  It looked days old. I definitely had to spit some of it out.

Rice was so dry it tasted like sand, Fajitas looked like and tasted like dog turd. Eggs were super watery. Their au jus tasted like armpit.  The ""fresh"" crepes were newspaper tossed in some butter with canned strawberries inside.  And their bread pudding was basically egg with sugar.

On top of that every cook looked like they were miserable to be there, really if you dont enjoy what you do (especially when it comes to cooking) then what are you doing there?  The cooks' lack of enthusiasm to love what they do completely reflects on their food!

Went back this past weekend for the Sunday brunch since we had time to kill before our flight.  Once we got there around 1pm we had to wait for about 40 minutes, which is a good thing IMO.  I was afraid quality going down since the last time I came was 2 years ago but crowd is a good sign.

Got in, and was surprised to find that the Sunday brunch was less than $30!  They have all the usuals: carving station with prime rib, seafood, American, Mexican etc.  Our favorite, surprisingly, was the spicy tuna roll!  I was skeptical when I first tried it but the surprising kick drew me in.  The rest of the table tried it and I think we must've killed over 20 of them as a table hahah.  The crabs were great since they were cracked in half for you.  

Tried the turkey and prime rib at the carving station.  Both were pretty good, but nothing too crazy about them.  Great au jus for the prime rib and they offered both creamed and smooth horseradish on the side.  At around 4pm, they started switching to dinner and they had this bacon pork belly at the carving station as well.  A little salty but not bad.

As for the Asian food section, again, nothing too crazy but I did like the BBQ pork bun.  There's also a Mid-Eastern section with hummus, tandoori, and others.  It's a nice change from the American and breakfast food items :P

The dessert section had a lot of different mousses and cakes, but my favorite was definitely the creme brulee.  Not served during lunch\/brunch, but since we stayed long enough for the dinner service, they had creme brulee out.  The soft serve machine was down so I didn't get a chance to grab anything :[

The cost isn't too bad, and you can always get the rewards program and do this thing where you can eat at the buffet for as many times as you want within a day, which is pretty convenient cause you can eat 5 smaller meals instead of one giant meal which will make you feel like you're gonna kill yourself.  This way you can taste EVERYTHING!  And it ends up being cheaper to buy this and eat as much as you want rather than going to other random places to eat a meal.",1,1,0

Where to eat where to eat? I remember back in the day that this used to be reputedly the best buffet in Vegas.... hmmmmmm

People wake me up to head downstairs for some grub... a lil too much grub. I finally realized why I gave up buffets in the first place.. i can't stop knowing that there's more and more for the taking. Grant it there is a lot of food... enough food for days of binging. They got asian, mexican, italian, and then some. Looks like one of the the boats off of Dangerous Catch off loaded here. 

But honestly, i wasn't that excited by it all. Nothing really grabbed me by the taste buds and kicked me in the face. I am much more about quality than quantity... most of the time that is. The most appetizing item in the whole place walked out as i walked in wearing next to nothing in 2 inch stilletos.

Don't get me wrong, its pretty daymn good and I left the place carrying mah belly  and all, but if you were expecting something like the Rio, or from what I remember, it's not like that.  Their seafood selection isn't great, but it does have the usual snow crabs which taste about right.  I hate it when some places have them extremely salty.  

But everything else is about a fair quality with a variety of foods from different cuisines.  I remmeber I kept going back for the crabs and mainly the prime rib.

I am Indian so was excited when I saw tandoori chicken, chicken curry and naan at the buffet but I was extremely disappointed. The tandoori chicken was absolutely not marinated, they just added a crap ton of red coloring to make it look appetizing. The naan is not really naan but just pita bread...false advertising?

Out of all the sections, I probably liked the seafood section the most but was a little careful because I didn't want to eat too much seafood and get a stomach ache later. The Asian section was horrible! The lo mein was so dry and the chicken looked rubbery and fake, again...I was extremely disappointed.

I could keep going on and on about all the crap food but I think you get the idea. The best part of the entire buffet was our server. She was very sweet and the only reason I'm giving Spice Market a star is because of her.

Weekend lunch price is $30.99+tax\/person and that is definitely a rip off. For the quality of the food, it should be more like $9.99\/person.

Service from the wait-staff was fantastic, our drinks were filled quickly and plates were taken away fast too.

That's a good thing because we had a lot of plates; looking for one good thing to eat.

Crab legs were small, shrimp had no flavor, entire middle eastern line-up sucked (my favorite type of food) and the prime rib had nothing to bring home about. Only thing I liked was the dessert at the end of the meal. Banana cream pie and creme brûlée were the standouts here.

As I walked up to the cashier, she gave me the price which was about $28 per person, I gladly supplied her with my credit card. She gave me the charge receipt and I wrote the tip amount into the receipt. She took the receipt from me and said there is a problem with me tipping on the card because she already closed the transaction. She said it would be difficult for me to tip on the receipt because she would have to void the transaction and then recharge the transaction. I said that was a silly thing to do. Then she suggested that we just charge the tip amount on the card as a separate transaction. I finally said we would just pay in cash at the table. The service wasn't very helpful to accommodate my payment method.

The seating area was not very spectacular. It felt like a HomeTown buffet, but with a little more class. The food was not very fresh. The lettuce in the salad was rather wilted and didn't taste very good. I tried a little sushi, but the rice was very hard. My sister told me that when she picked the sushi up, the rice already cracked in half.

The prime rib and ribs were average. I do have to say the duck was rather tasty. I think this was the best part of the meal.

The Spice Market is a very bizarre name for this buffet. However bizarre name is the least of this place's gripes.

After that VERY long stair trip down (WTF?!), you get to the atrociously handled lineups. When you finally get through to the desk, yore asked if youre a rewards member or some crap. Aright. I'm seated at a table. terrible service, I asked the (very grumpy) waitress for a second glass of coke, and I didn't get it. I tried even getting her attention and she ignored me completely. NO TIP FOR YOU! (said in Italian accent)

The food is subpar, really. I don't see how this has the reputation of being the best buffet in Vegas. Obviously Las Vegans have low standards, but that's alright I guess. The gravy from the pot roast was caked on, why? The lamb skewers were overly elasticy. Wasn't a fan of the fried shrimp either.

But... THAT DESERT!!!! so yummy. I loved the cotton candy! The hand made tarts and what not... Yum! And the custard with strawberry sauce!!!! I'm a sucker for a good dessert, and this was it.

I wandered into the Spice Market Buffet because I wanted something quick and casual for dinner and I'm staying at Planet Hollywood.  Having never been to a Las Vegas buffet before I figured it is something that one needs to experience anyway.  First I was a little surprised by how much it cost:  $28.00.  Isn't this supposed to be cheap eats?  Oh yeah, there's no such thing in Vegas.  The food was across the board awful.  I made my way around the world starting with middle eastern food.  I tossed some hummus on my plate with a stuffed grape leaf and the guy behind the counter served me some grilled chicken hunks, which were pink like it was tandoori (weird) with a small pita.  The pita was totally stale and the chicken was dry as a bone.  The hummus and the stuffed grape leaf were just ok.  I then moved on to the seafood - ah, the ever popular all you can eat shrimp and alaskan king crab legs.  I was excited but quickly disppointed at the first bite.  The crab was incredibly salty, watery and had a strange texture.  The shrimp were the same as the ones you get at the supermarket pre cooked.  After I abandoned the seafood I went for mexican.  I picked up a flour tortilla, some beans, cheese and cilantro, but passed on all of the protein because it looked so bad.  I picked up one small piece of chicken to taste (with the tongs of course!!!) and it was super salty and peppery.  I wrapped up what I had in the tortilla and it was okay.  The beans were pretty good.  Then for good measure I stopped at the italian food and chose a spinach lasgana roll.  yuck.  Also too salty and had a funny texture.  Kind of like bad frozen stuff.

Now the crab legs, which can really be hit or miss.  I've been here several times, and the consistency isn't there.  Sometimes the crab legs are dry, sometimes overly salty, sometimes awesome.  Can't quite figure it out, but I would think they would be more consistent with the crab legs.

This place know the important of having the butter sauce, which makes it even better. 

Prime Rib - a staple among all buffets (sorry hometown) so you really just go off the quality. When i stepped up to the plate to select my cut and size i noticed a lonely and what appeared to be end cut of prime rib just waiting on the side of the cutting board so i then asked the butcher if he was saving that piece for someone. He said whoever asks, its theirs and also complimented me on my choice of cut since the end cut is bay far the best but not a lot of people know about it.....thanks House of Prime Rib for the knowledge

The dessert selection was okay also, the bread pudding was delicious and for all you who love cotton candy, yes they have a machine here however unfortunately its not self serve.

My main recommendation is that if doing any buffet in Vegas, you owe it to yourself really to do the 24 hour buffet pass which lets you do  series of buffets unlimited for 24 hours, the kicker being that the price isnt too far off from admission to a single eating buffet ticket",2,0,1

Funny how that never happens to me. They must be coming on a holiday or something, where all buffets in Vegas will be quite pricey. Most of the time im paying around $25, which is typically the price on any given day. To me that's a very reasonable price for the quality and selection they offer. Lots of people seem to get too caught up in the Bellagio and Wynn buffet quality and end up taking their anger on the review for this place. I like. It's definitely not the best, but its got a lot of good things about it. For me, the crepes are an x-factor. Im a big fan of crepes and no matter how stuffed I am I can always make room for their crepes and the other desserts they have. I would compare this place to like the high middle class of buffets. And I suggest you give it a shot. Its descent and respectable.

The gist...

PROS: lower prices with a pretty large selection (if youre just wanting to eat shrimp and crab legs, why pay over $30 when you can come here and have the same quality and size in crab legs and shrimp). Also, did i mention they make crepes for you.

CONS: Higher prices on some days may make you feel like you've over paid. Quality is not as good as Bellagio or Wynn. Same goes for seletction.",1,0,0

My cousin and I came by for a Fourth of July brunch. They had a special menu that really wasn't that special to begin with.

The only reason that I was tempted to give this place a go was the fact that they had a Mediterranean section. But they got me good, cause all the Mediterranean food was tasteless. Chicken and lamb kebabs were dry, tabbouleh wasn't terrific -- just everything in that section wasn't great.

I really enjoyed the prime rib though. But that could be found at basically every Vegas buffet. (You just gotta believe it's there.)

Desserts were dull, too.

It also had the run of the mill Italian section, pizzas, salad bar and carving stations. Everything was just A-OK. I actually can't really remember anything in particular jumping out at me.

She told us ""there is another cashier on the other side"" but there were so many people squished together, we did not want to squish through and be squished while paying! So I let her know that we know we have the option, but we would rather not push through the people. I told her that just because we pay sooner and squish, does not mean we will get seated faster because there was already a line backed up for the people waiting to be seated. It was so backed up that the cashier wasn't even calling for us to come over! She was waiting for the hostess to seat people so everyone could be comfortably walking around! Then I hear that the old ass grandpa wanted to cuss me out because of what I said. I was not even rude...I was just letting the lady know. I'm sorry but I think that a 65 year old man cussing out a 19 year old girl is just ridiculous. Completely classless!!

I usually recommend this buffet to friends and family, especially on how great the crab legs are. But if everyone ate here on this particular day, they would all look at me downright crazy.

I was highly disappointed in the crab legs. They were still semi-frozen and not completely thawed out. Once I took a bite out of the meat, all I could taste was the combination of ice crystals and flavorless shellfish. Okay, I figured why not try to salvage this. I tried waiting for the legs to thaw out, tried dipping the crab into some melted butter, and even ordered a cup of steaming hot water in an attempt to thaw out the legs. Nothing worked. The poor crab meat had already suffered from freezer burn. It was too late.

I suspected that the workers behind the counter knew this, because I didn't see anyone behind the counter near the crab legs. They probably didn't want to deal with anyone bombarding them to steam the crab legs. It would simply take too much time. 

I also saw a dish entitled Lobster Pasta or something similar to that. Upon closer inspection, it was simply lumps of imitation crab meat. Ohh, that was so wrong.

What trip to Vegas would be complete without taking a journey through one of  the many gluttonous buffets? My friends and I decided to go to the Spice Market Buffet for dinner. With a $30-ish price tag it was like most other buffets on the strip. They had their layout with different stations. On the left side of the buffet they had the seafood station, next to it was the Italian section, followed by the Asian section, then the American Section, the dessert section the Middle Eastern, and then the Mexican section. Next to the Mexican station was the salad bar, but twas closed. I highly doubt anyone was disappointed at that.....cuz if you were.......
In between the stations were soup stations, but I mainly stuck to the previous stations. The food was good, and they surprisingly had a decent variety amongst each station. The seafood station had crab legs for lazy people, and by lazy I mean they were already cut in half for you. What really won me over was the fact that they had shrimp tempura, and not a tempura mix. I'm a fan of vegetable tempura, but the fact that they had an entire tray full of shrimp tempura was awesome. Now you won't have to deal with people that just jack the shrimp and leave nothing but vegetables. When I went to the Middle Eastern section I got lamb. the lamb was a tad dry, but it was still good. I think when we were sat, the staff looked at us and thought ""I think it's best if we sit them next to the dessert station. Just look at them...."" I couldn't agree more. They had a chef that made crepes, just for you. But what won me over was that they had creme brulee, and carrot cake. I'm a sucker for carrot cake.

The main reasons I ate here twice were the crab legs and peel-and-eat shrimp. The crab legs are already perfectly cracked for you!! All you need to do is put them on a plate, carry them to your table, and pull the meat out. Wonderfully easy and very fresh. The shrimp are a bit more work but equally fresh and delicious. 

Sections on the buffet include soups, salads, Mexican, Asian, Italian, seafood, American and Mediterranean. If you go before 8:45 pm, be prepared to wait. My only complaint is that they needed to have more cashiers working and should have also had at least one more hostess to seat people...only two stars for customer service. With the exception of the crab station, there were no lines for the food, only for the cashiers and the seating staff.

I digress...

Spice Market has a wonderful spread that encompasses a lot of different ethnic cuisines. I tried my best to sample a little of each and all of it was really fare game. I do, however, feel that sometimes some of the food can get dry or stale, and that a little more attention could have been paid to what was out there! I've never seen a buffet actually run out of food (aside from crab legs) for an extended amount of time as much as I had at Spice Market.

The prime rib was very good. Not overly seasoned on the outside crust (which some might like), beefy, tender and medium rare. 

The crab legs are served nicely, cut in half along the length of the leg to make getting the meat out really easy. What I didn't like was the temperature. Half were brought out of the fridge, immersed in their own juices and simply served ""chilled"" without ice. These legs had a really off putting flavor and wetness to them. The legs they warmed up were ""resteamed"" but were often not heated enough. Lukewarm crabs aren't so great.

I bought a coupon on Travelzoo and upgraded to All You Can Drink for an extra ten bucks.  At that or price it was worth it.  Most of the Mexican station food had been dried out by the heating lamps.  At the seafood and Eastern station they continued to cook fresh food throughout the evening and strangely  enough, the Chinese food station had better lamb than the Middle Eastern station.

Our service person was lovely and kept us well lubricated with the AYCD wine, even while bussing plates of uneaten shrimp off tables. We gave her a $20 which I thought was reasonable for all the work she did and she was incredibly thankful.

We were excited about the variety of food, but after visiting each station, it was more of the same. The mac & cheese, literally had no cheese in it, it was some type of cream with NO taste... The mussels were very crusty, overcooked, rubbery ... The cesar salad was welted. The seafood pasta had no flavor, some type of cream used again. Even the juice wasn't real juice .. 

However, the dessert was the best station. Options actually had flavor! And about 2 dozen choices. Creme Brule was on point! For $30.99 a person for lunch, not worth it. A more upscale buffet at the Venetian or Bellagio may be worth it, but don't waste your money here. We would NOT go back.",1,0,0

I'm sure it was there at the other buffets, but it wasn't until our final stop, here at Spice Market, that I saw cotton candy at a buffet.  That's very creative, cotton candy at a buffet!  (I didn't eat any, but still...)  And what's also a bit different here at the Spice Market is that whatever it is that you're drinking is also serve yourself buffet-style.  (I believe Spice Market also has an all-you-can-drink alcohol menu as well, if that's at all necessary.)  I liked it here, not as much as Rio's buffet, but it's worthy of applause.  Again, there are many, many cuisine styles available to choose from, and the dessert bar is certainly noteworthy, but I have to include how tasty the pork roast was.  I loved it.  As a matter of fact, I felt that the ""American"" selections were much more appealing than some of the others.  I usually stray from American foods (as I've had so much), but the mashed potatoes, green beans, and the sliced pork roast and turkey were my favorites.

My wife bought a groupon for 2 for $46.

The good:
We were seated rather quickly.  The service was pretty good.  Our table server was attentive and filled our waters and drinks pretty quickly.  

The bad
The restaurant was not exceptionally clean.  There were a number of tables that had not been cleaned and were waiting to be bussed.
The restaurant has a strange layout.  The food is spread over a rather large area and broke into sections.  It gives a rather odd sense of not really knowing completely what is available.

The disappointing
The food quality overall is just average at best.  There were a few things that were pretty good, however generally this buffet is similar to any international buffet in my hometown that you could go to for $15 or $20.  The crab legs were cold and clearly a smaller size than some of the other buffets in Vegas.  The sushi is terrible.  There was an abundance of low cost pasta dishes etc that fill you up, but are not very distinguishable etc.

Ultimately, my meal wasn't awful, however I wouldn't return.  I only get the opportunity to go to Vegas once in a while, during my limited time there I rather go to one of the premier buffets.  Clearly, those buffets are more expensive, however I left feeling disappointed that I didn't take the opportunity to eat at a nicer place.

It really is quite a deal, considering the variety and quality of the food you get.  We got our buffets for only $ 13-14\/person, and that was the lunch buffet!  That's a steal, considering the Wynn buffet is like $25, and the selection of hot food is not nearly as good as at the Spice Market.  

Spice Market consistently wins the ""best buffet"" in Vegas mainly for it's affordability and top-notch quality.  It won in 2006 and again in 2007, and I'm sure it will be up again for 2008.  Granted, when you come to Spice Market, you don't really expect food like at the Bellagio buffet. But honestly in a blind-folded test, I think I would like the Spice Market buffet more than the Bellagio buffet.   

The atmosphere is casual\/modern, and there are nice green booths as well as open tables.  The colors range from khakis, to greens, to yellows, all in all to make a pleasant eating experience.  On the walls are several flat screen TVs showing the Food Network, so you can think about delicious dishes even more, and let your food digest while you look at someone else's fabulous finds on TV!

Spice Market has awesome pork ribs.  These ribs are flavorful and juicy, and practically melt off the bone.  They're exceptionally good, and I'm not really a rib person, but I kept going back for more of these!!

They also have awesome skewered roasted veggies at the Indian food station.  Huge metal skewers carry roasted zucchini, squash and eggplant, and each morsel of veggie is juicy, not-dry, and just awesome with every bite!!  Oh yes, the tandori chicken at this station is also very good.  It's not too dry, and you get these little kebabs of tandori chicken to go with your skewered veggies.  Check out the saffron rice with raisins in it!  It's awesome.

The meditteranean station is also a stand out at Spice Market buffet.  They have baba ghanoush, freshly made hummus, tabouli and grape leaves.  The baba ghanoush is very good, especially with a sprinkle of olive oil and dash of chili pepper.  Yum.

The seafood section at Spice Market has jumbo shrimp, sushi, lox and some hand rolls.  Not bad, but not really a standout.  

The dessert station is pretty good---there's flan, chocolate mousse cakes, warm brownies, an ice cream machine with fruity toppings, and there's even a way to order your own crepe!

Service was excellent.  The waiter was very friendly, and kept clearing our plates in a timely manner.  He even offered freshly brewed coffee at the end of our meal.  Wow, I think the coffee was Starbucks, or maybe even Peets, because it was strong, hot and very flavorful. 

Overall, for $13-14\/person, this is a very affordable buffet in Vegas.  It's really good too, so don't think that you'll necessarily get a better deal at the Bellagio buffet.  I think the Bellagio and Wynn buffets are over hyped anyways.  Check out the Spice Market Buffet.  The ribs are phenomenal!!  And the after meal coffee is SOOO good.",2,0,2

The crab legs are nice here because they are pre-split so you don't have to crack them open yourself, saving you valuable minutes of gluttony time.  The food here is separated by regions, such as Italian, Mexican, Middle Eastern, etc.  Being at least a platinum Total Rewards member really helps here because the line for the more plebeian customer gets very long in a short amount of time.  In general, the quality is decent; they are going for more variety while sacrificing some quality vs. a small amount of foods that taste absolutely spectacular (as is the case with most buffets).",0,0,0

What I was not prepared for was waiting almost an hour in that line just to get to the cashier.  The entire time, watching others descend the escalator and cut in line in front of us, all of this in front of staff members that watched and said nothing.  Once I finally did pay for my meal I was ushered to another line, where I waited another 40 minutes to be seated.  While in this line, large groups of people that were behind us in line were pulled and seated before smaller groups.  Also while in this line I was able to observe many empty tables.  Some in need of bussing , and some ready for service.  They just sat.  When bussers  did arrive, there was no sense of urgency whatsoever to turn the tables and get things moving more slowly.  Multiple times I saw managers walk by an unbussed table, or a busser, and not lift a finger to help.  This shows the average person that they have no desire to move the lines along and help the process, or to help the people they supervise.  

When we were taken to our seats we were sat next to an extremely loud and rowdy group that made conversation absolutely impossible.  Although I realize that this behavior is not the fault of the buffet or hotel staff, the fact that their tables were arranged in such a way that for them to reach their table, they had to slide their rear ends along my table was something that the staff had control over, and was not a pleasant part of my evening.  

Finally seated, and thirsty from waiting in line with so many other people for so long, we waited more than 10 minutes for drink service.  The drinks did arrive promptly when they were ordered, but the beer I ordered was quite warm.

Finally, with our thirsts quenched, we set out for food.  The food was average at best, there wasn't a very good selection compared to other buffets (even those at locals casinos), and several of the labels for the food were incorrect.  Because of how busy it was, chefs were obviously rushing and it was effecting the quality of the food, with some items being put on the line either incomplete or cold and uncooked.  Since it was a buffet, which afforded us the opportunity to go back and sample things again, we did just that, with the same results.  

Upon leaving we were more happy to be leaving than satisfied that we had eaten, and then we saw the line.  As we left the line for the buffet was stopped by a buffet employee at the escalator (for obvious safety reasons) and continued out into the casino. The line snaked all the way through the casino and to the entrance of the mall.  I couldn't help but think that if I waited in line for more than an hour, how long would these poor folks have to wait?  

I suppose the ultimate points are, this buffet is not very good, especially not for an on strip buffet.  If you find that you want or need to go to this buffet, go early, at the beginning of the service times.  The lines will be shorter, and there is a better chance that the food quality will be better because the staff has not been rushing around trying to play catch up for hours, just throwing food on the buffet.",2,0,1

He wasn't that impressed with his food but thought it was fine for the buffet. I would recommend staying away from the bland American selections and visiting the Mediterranean table. We each enjoyed two glasses of champagne during the meal and then sat around for an hour talking and taking our time before desert. The place was busy but not too busy so that we felt rushed. After an hour, we each ordered a glass of red wine to have with dessert and went to check out the desert selections. They had a beautiful assortment of cupcakes which were one of the highlights of my experience here. They also had creme brûlée which I found to be delicious and not too sweet. Fiancé had some cupcakes and enjoyed them. We spent about two hours here and had a great time. We could have lingered and enjoyed more unlimited drinks but it was very hot in Vegas and three drinks over two hours is more than enough. Don't wanna overdo it in the heat. I would say this place is a 3.5 for food 4 for service (waitress was very nice- make sure to tip a dollar for each drink you get at least!) and a 5 for value. We got the deal on TravelZoo if you want to check it out.",1,0,0

Most of the food is either very salty, over fried and greasy or flavorless. I'm a big seafood buff and I have to say their selection was little to none. No sushi except 2 types of pathetic little rolls. I didn't take pictures cause it wasn't worth the effort.

I tried it cause the reviews were mixed and there was a groupon- but not worth it. I think the best part was the Pepsi.

I don't write negative reviews but this called for it.  We went there for brunch at around 11am.  The options seemed appealing, but taste-wise it was appalling.  My three most-liked: crab-stuffed sole, baklava and lemon macaroons.  Even so, sauce for the sole was extremely salty and the baklava seemed drenched in liquid sugar and was tough to bite into.  Many of the dishes I tried tasted confusing to me... sometimes too bland (mid-eastern dishes) or all around *not right*, like the wonton soup in the Asian section.  First there was not a single wonton in that pot, it was just broth.  Second, too obvious that the broth was really Knorr's chicken bouillon.  For a place that has received rave reviews I would expect the broth to be cooked properly, not boiled bouillon.  We won't go back to this place.",0,0,0

After we were shown to our table we immediately headed for the seafood section! I filled my plate with crab legs, shrimp cocktail, crab stuffed fish and some slices of cheese. Those are the only things I ate at the buffet LOL no joke I literally had a repeat of the same plate 3x! HAHA They have both cold & hot crab legs everyday of the week! They are snow crab legs but they are already sliced down the middle to make it easier to eat. If the crab leg selection doesn't look that great just kindly ask the worker behind the counter to refill it! The shrimp were not that big but were already peeled and ready to go.   The fish was moist and stuffed with a tasty buttery crab stuffing! They had some interesting things that other buffets don't have like a whole section for middle eastern cuisine~ 
Our server was really nice and after giving her a little tip and after she realized I drink a lot of wine, she just left the whole bottle with us LOL 

We left stuffed, happy & pretty buzzed! The regular price for the buffet is around $30\/person.. I only think that is worth paying if you eat a lot crab legs and drink a lot of wine!

While the buffet at Planet Hollywood has a wide variety (including a Mediterranean station) it lacks any semblance of quality and has scant offerings for vegetarians or pescetarians (people who eat fish and veggies).

So, here's why it gets one star:
The sushi rice was undercooked and firm.  The sushi had a rubbery texture.
The shrimp tempura was crispy, yet cold.
The crab legs on the self service bar were cold and could either be blanched in hot water, or taken to eat chilled at the table.  Chilled should not mean the crab legs are frozen in the center.
The Asian station had absolutely no vegetarian offerings, other than the steamed (and undercooked) rice.
The soups were only mediocre.
The vegetables on skewers in the Mediterranean station sit on a cutting board that is shared with meat.  And the baklava was stale.  It also lacked sweetness or filling other than the phyllo dough.
The Mexican station allowed you to make your own taco.  The had rice.  Can you guess...undercooked.

FOOD
+ Dessert: Yeah, let's get right to dessert first. Cupcakes. The dessert section is comprised of just cupcakes. Ok, I'm fibbing, there's a self-serve yogurt station and I think some trays of pudding and cobblers, but that's all. The cupcakes are store-quality. The best I had were the mint and peanut butter cup. To me, the Kahlua should've been renamed to ""Banana Cupcake"" because it tasted like a banana. 

+ Random Food Section: That's what I'm calling the section that has fish and chips (actual potato chips...), sushi, and tempura (shouldn't the last two be moved to the ""Asian"" section? *shrugs*) The tempura was golden and deep fried, but heavily battered. The fish from the fish & chips tray was sadly, flavorless.

+ Salad: There are two salad stations that serve similar foods. Both have grilled veggies (best part of my entire meal). One has cold salads like macaroni and tuna; whereas, one section has the mixed greens and toppings. 


+ Mediterranean: Stuffed grape leaves were OK, but the baba ganoush was incredibly dry. 

RESTAURANT SETUP
The entire buffet is smaller to other buffets on The Strip. Dining areas are located too close to the food. I likened my maneuvering around diners to an obstacle course.  Awkward. 

There are television sets throughout the restaurant. When I was there they aired several different NCAA games. Unfortunately, the display size and quality made it difficult for my cousin and I to watch the game because the scores on the bottom were cropped out.

SERVICE
It was fine, although the waiter seemed a little ticked when I requested clean dining utensils.

Nothing special here, just a mediocre variety of food to fill up on for the day before you go gamble. The reason I'm giving this review a one star rating is due to the fact that this buffet wouldn't honor a comp buffet voucher for my girlfriend who came to Vegas for the first time and wanted to try here. As a new gold member for total rewards, she eagerly played the slots and excitedly earned a free buffet. The morning we went to here, we were hungry and ready to eat. We got denied the use of the voucher because the ""manager decided they weren't taking any coupons or vouchers"". Complete b s. They pulled this stunt on Christmas Eve. Here we are ready to eat and get turned away. The only advice we got from the staff there was, ""talk to the manager"". A lot of help that was to fight for our case. In the end I said loudly, ""let's get out of this garbage place and find somewhere better to eat"". We ended up eating at the much much better Cesar Palace's Bacchanal buffet anyways. They treat total rewards members right over there.",0,0,0

I came here for brunch and was looking forward to the variety. Sadly, the food had me wondering what the hype was all about, and it's kind of a shame because I like what PH has done with the rest of the place...

The labels were pretty useful, I'll give them that. Everything was just really so-so, and even fun things like seafood were disappointing. The better section was probably the Mexican food. They have all the staples, but just fall really on the mediocre side in terms of quality.

The cotton candy is a lot of fun, so are the different desserts, but I wouldn't run back here for that.

Since going to Vegas is usually a vacation of some sort, I always figure I might as well budget a buffet like Rio or Paris. To eat here again, I'd need it paid for or super discounted. 

Bottomline: Move along... nothing much to see here.",2,1,2

It had a pretty good variety, the wait was not too long, and there were a lot of foods that they would slice for your on demand (so that it remains ""juicy"").  I think that with buffets, you can not expect a high quality in food since they are preparing so many different dishes in such large amounts, but this certainly was not the worst that I have had.

Overall I think that I would go again if I were on the strip.  I would not waste my time with Todai and I probably would not want to spend more money at the MGM for sushi or Asian cuisine at the Grand Wok and so I would opt for this.  The M Studio B buffet is still my favorite.",0,0,1

It took me forever to find the buffet entrance... I had no idea you had to take an escalator down to get to the entrance.  So I spent a good time searching for it and had to stop for directions.  The inside of the buffet is nicely decorated and the food stations were separated by cuisine... major plus!  And they had a Mediterranean station... that is a first i have seen.  Granted the section was not that big but i do love my Indian food!  So slowly I go through most of the sections.  Starting with the seafood... everything thing in this section was pretty good... the stuffed fish was a little eh to me tho.  Next was the salad cold section... i'd say... stay away... no matter how good it looks... (remember looks can be deceiving) .  The Asian section can be skipped... unless you do not know what really good Asian food tastes like....  stick to the dim sum its probably one of the better things in this section.  American Section was probably the biggest section and there was nothing unusual here... carved meats potatoes... everything was delish in this section.  The Mediterranean  section had oodles of good stuff.. from curry to tandoori chicken... very good!  Dessert was okay... usually I get almost one of everything that i find appetizing.  I tried a little of everything.. it was all okie.. nothing really special.. nothing that would make me go back for a second slice... except for the chocolate cake... that was amazingly sweet and good.

It's not that it's bad.  It's ordinary.
Have you ever eaten at a really good college cafeteria?  It's like that.

Crab legs, shrimp, oysters.  Yawn.
Chinese food that looked like it had been sitting for hours.
Some prime rib (probably the best thing there), pork loin, roast turkey (dry).
I didn't even bother with the Italian section.  Besides the salad bar, that's all there was.  Exotic?  Not even close.  No Mexican, no Mediterranean, etc.

Desserts were many in selection, but just average in taste.  At $29.99 a head, you put out M&Ms and jelly beans as dessert selections?  Come on.

I would say this was only slightly better than the buffet at the Golden Nugget which I sampled the week before.  And I don't see them touting their Zagat review.

Still, the food was worthy of 3 stars. I knocked one star off for service. When we were being seated, the host was a little condescending toward my Uncle for no apparent reason. Once we were seated, our waitress never once checked to see if our glasses needed to be refilled. We literally had to hunt her down for refills the entire meal, and when we did get her attention it was easily a 10-15 minute wait for refills.

Even though I consider myself a lady, I couldn't stop looking at the laa-dies!!!  How else was I going to get to this buffet?

Buffet of Buffets got me and this was my final and last stop.  24 hours came and went in a flash!  It was only 2 hours ago that I had lunch but I only had 4 more hours before this 24 hour bracelet expires!  

We waited in line for about 20 minutes, which is reasonable.  As we reach our cashier, I asked the guy to cut my branded bracelet off of me.  He asked me if I was sure... I actually hesitated for a second, thinking, I can get another buffet in!!!  As he cut the bracelet off, I felt a tinge of sadness...AHHHH!!!  No more buffets!  But a slight happiness too... AHHHH!!! No more buffets!  The deed was done...

Both of us being still full from our last buffet adventure, sat for a very long time before heading up to grab food.  And my round 1 attempt was pathetic... 

Round 1: pesto pasta, fried chicken, mash potatoes, anti-pasta, various cheese slices and olives

Round 2: Alaskan crab legs and shrimp cocktails with fresh lemons

Round 3: Chips and salsa, tandori chicken, baklava, prime rib

Round 4: Alaskan crab legs (hey, don't judge, this stuff doesn't take up much tummy real estate :P)

I requested for hot tea at the end of the meal and it was Lipton, bleh.  But the wow factor came when they gave you a small jar of honey to go with your tea.

1. Salad bar didn't have a huge selection

3. American selection was pretty bland meatloaf with barbecue sauce. Who can screw up macaroni and cheese??? This buffet did.

At one point the Spice Market Buffet (SMB) at Planet Hollywood (formerly Aladdin) was named the best buffet on the strip. I don't know who holds the title now but damn they must really have had to out do themselves to beat the SMB which still holds the crown in my opinion.

Unlike the buffet that I'm used to in L.A. (lets just say its in my ""Hometown"") SMB doesn't make you feel like they're herding cows and feeding you slop. The food here is top notch and great quality. You've got hundreds of choices to choose from and you're guaranteed to find something to make you say ""damn!""

The prices vary from Breakfast ($15ish) to Dinner ($25ish) and can get a little on the $$$ range but there are deals you can take advantage of. I recommend 24 hour buffet of buffet pass and start with dinner. You can pretty much plan out 4 meals (which can include 2 dinners if you time it right) and come out on top.

We got here around 4:45 PM on a Saturday, which was super early as we had just eaten at Paris only five hours beforehand. But there was no wait at all, so we strolled through the line, got a table, and sat there for awhile before we got food. And pretty soon ten minutes later, there was a super long line! Talk about good timing. :)

The stations are pretty similar to the other buffets - Prime rib, salad, Asian, Italian, Seafood, Dessert, etc. They did have a Brazilian barbecue of lamb or beef off of skewers. That was pretty good. And yes, they had the crab legs. The only difference is that here, the crab legs are cut in half for you so you don't have to dig for the meat. So be prepared for the long lines. I stood behind a lady who took her time picking out all the crab legs ... and then she turned to me and said ""my dinner..."" 

The clam chowder soup is good, and the prime rib is better than the other two buffets - very tender and delicious. Pretty worth it! I loaded my plate up with veggies - very fresh and the salad was crisp, too. The pizza, eh looked quite bad as if sitting there for a long time. They had some fried shrimp, I believe which was tasty. 

The best part is the dessert! I think they also have a crepes station, but after the not so good crepes at Le Village, we decided to skip it. They have upside down cake with strawberries, chocolate cake, tarts, chocolate covered strawberries, creme brulee, cotton candy. I loaded up on the desserts and ended my meal with cotton candy - which was uberly sweet. And I also drank milk as my beverage. And feasted on some more creme brulee - which was not as good as Le Village! Not such a good combination with the prime rib, crab legs and whatnot and I ended up getting an upset stomach.

When the chef arrived at our table, he spoke very halting English and clearly didn't understand what we were saying. The manager clearly was not interested in any criticism of any sort.

Obviously the entrees aren't going to be the same quality as if you went to a restaurant and ordered a single entree. If that is what you're looking for, then you shouldn't be considering a buffet at all.  

I absolutely LOVE this buffet because I am really into middle eastern food (hummus, etc.) but what really makes it for me is the bottomless mimosa (I believe on weekends only). People complain about the price, but drink enough mimosas and you can come out way ahead.

My friends and I always have a great time here; there is something for everyone and for a buffet, the food is pretty damn good.

It's a champagne brunch with all you can drink. While standing in the long line granted it was during the peak brunch time at around noonish, I could see the extensive choices. There's selection, like an American station, Mexican station, Middle Eastern (this includes Indian, weird!), Asian, Italian (apparently pancakes and french toast are Italian), a breakfast station, a dessert station, a seafood station and two salad stations. As I said, it's extensive. So, I was hungry, my belly was growling and I remember seeing someone eating a cotton candy as they were leaving Spice Market so I was intrigued by this. Anywho, stood in line, paid, stood in line yet again and my party of five was eventually seated after a half hour wait. So we gave our drink orders, and a friend and I took our turn to get our food. Of course I was excited, I saw on the screens while we were waiting that was chicken curry at the Middle Eastern station so I knew I had to get some. Grabbed two plates and started with an Eggs benedict, BACON, got some chicken curry, tandoori chicken, some steamed rice, a steamed pork bun (yea i was getting my feast on) and proceeded back to the table to get crunk with my food. Sadly that was not to be, the chicken curry was salty and lacked flavor (what happened to spice? huh Spice Market?!), the tandoori chicken was rubbery and so lackluster, it felt limp in my mouth =( , the steamed rice was not that soft (like how do you mess that up?!), the Eggs Benedict egg was not runny but COOKED through, seriously?!! The only two things that were satisfactory was the bacon and the pork bun. So I thought maybe it's a fluke? I must have chose the wrong food items, so back I went to the buffet and this time, I got a blueberry and cherry crepe, a slice of french toast, some fruit (cantaloupe and pineapple) and a fruit cobbler. the crepe was meh I've had way better, the french toast was limp and blah, the fruit not sweet and the fruit cobbler was generic. The $31 was money wasted, I might have been full from sampling everything but I was not satisfied, rather I felt cheated.

This place offered us plenty of options to choose from which was perfect for us because we really weren't in the mood for anything in specific. We headed over to Planet Hollywood to purchase tickets for a burlesque show and had some time to kill before the show so we decided to grab dinner. I found the buffet to be spacious and the spread of the stations were well organized. Honestly speaking, for the price you pay for an all you can eat and you can drink buffet, I was not expecting the quality of anything to be out of this world. The buffet had its hits and misses but overall, we enjoyed our experience.

At first, it did take my server a while to refill my champagne glass even though every time she came to the table she would ask my boyfriend if he wanted another beer when he had barely even touched this. After the second refills she caught on to the fact that I was the drinker out of the two and she continuously kept my glass full.

What I Recommend:

- Crab Stuffed Sole: Absolutely loved these! The fish was cooked to perfection and the stuffing was full of flavor. Definitely couldn't have just one!

 -Pesto Penne: While I normally stay away from pasta at most restaurants, I decided to give this one a try and it was delicious without being too heavy.

-Pork Buns: Fluffy buns and tender pork, need I say more?

-Meatballs: I didn't have high expectations for these because most meatballs I've tried in restaurants turn out to be bland and dry. These meatballs were moist and seasoned well.

-Crab Legs: Chilled or steamed, these are awesome!

-Cannoli Cupcakes: These were divine! I'm not the biggest fan of sweets but these were great. The cannoli was perfect!

Maybe it was a one time thing and people were having a bad day. Regardless, the food is okay for the price in comparison to some places, but if I had known the management was so rude I would have splurged on a nice one. 

So here's the story, I found a glass shard in my dessert. Now this was the first time I have ever been there, and I went because my friends said it was a good place. Now I wasn't mad that I found a glass shard in my food because I understand people make mistakes. So I went to the hostess and told her about it and she was shocked. So her took out the dessert from the table display. 

When I got back to my seat, my friends didn't want to eat anymore, and we pretty much lost our appetite. My friends were mad because the manager didn't come to see how I was doing, but I didn't mind. So instead we went up there's to the front and my friend called for the manager. When the manager came he was nonchalant and said ""so you're the people who found the glass in your food."" My friend then asks how do we report the glass in the food, and the manager says that he has taken the food with the glass out so we don't have to do anything. And then it became awkward. 

The situation started to feel like we were a few crooks who purposely put glass in the food to score some free stuff. To be honest, I just wanted an apology and a refund. The manner in which the management handled the situation was piss poor. It was only when my other friend started to get angry did the manager offer us a free ticket for the next time we come back. I don't want to have to start a scene to be treated well at a place I paid for. We denied the offer and left while the manager was getting the ticket. 

I left that place feeling very disrespected.",1,0,0

I believe there was a Mexican, Italian, Asian, Middle Eastern, American, Seafood, Soup and Salad stations as well as dessert. To keep this review on the shorter side I'll say that the food I tried from the various stations were all pretty good for the most part but there were one or two items from the various sections that I didn't think were that good compared to other places. The pork fried rice in the Asian area, was one let down. It had a weird taste and there was little to no pork in it at all. Definitely a dish that needs to be revamped. The pork buns were very delicious and for me, it was the highlight of the Asian area. Each station only has a few items to choose from which was pretty disappointing. I guess I just expected a little more variety from each station than what we were offered.

 The dessert station was pretty nice in my opinion. The variety in this area was satisfying. There were various flavors of cupcakes as well as different mini cakes, pastries, tarts, cotton candy and even ice cream. There was so much I wanted to try but had to keep my sugar intake to a minimum. Most of the delicious treats they offered I just took a bite of just to say I tried it. There was something there to satisfy anyones sweet tooth for sure. Now back to the food stations for a sec. If I had to choose a station I enjoyed the most it would definitely be the Middle Eastern one. Most of the offerings at that station were just delicious! I had the tandoori chicken, lamb, beef kabobs, curry chicken and curry lamb and they were by far my favorites in the entire buffet. Oh, and the mac n cheese in the American section was the best i've had out of the two buffets I've visited in Vegas. 

 The service here was pretty good. Our server was great about keeping our cups filled and our empty plates off the table.

However I can assure the seafood isn't bad, not super, but good enough for a buffet. The meat, some were good, some was a bit dry. I had the ends of the prime rib, so it was kind of dry. The brisket was very good. The rib was pretty tender off the bone good. Both meats, and mostly all the meats are pretty fatty. (that's how they get you!) The sushi bar is quite week.

Wait:
I've been to Spice Market a half dozen times over the last decade and this meal was a far cry from the flavorful buffet I remembered from past visits. The wait was long, which I expected, but we were briskly instructed to move along in the downstairs maze by a cashier, which I found to be unnecessary (felt a little like cattle!). Once I paid for two dinner buffets ($67 for two adults...dang), we waited another 10 minutes before being directed to our table. 

Service:
We loaded up on our first plates...no utensils initially required since we went for Mexican fare. Good thing, since no server came by. I had to ask one of the employees directing people to their seats for our silverware. Halfway through our second plate we finally managed to wave our server down to get drinks. Which were never refilled. 

Food:
I used to love the Spice Market for its good quality and variety (which one should expect for the price). Mediocre at best, truly. Lots of lukewarm, borderline bland dishes. The Middle Eastern station was best, with decent dolmas and Moroccan vegetable dish. Dessert were also fine, but Italian, Seafood, and Mexican were pretty crummy.

The food, however, was tired, dry and lacking flavor.  Nothing was worth a second bite.  Stuff we've liked before was either not-available or had just declined in quality.  I won't be returning.",1,0,0

Honestly I don't even see how a buffet could be bad because there's got to be something they could do right. I got a deal on Groupon for beer, wine, and champagne unlimited, and the buffet. Since beer, wine, and champagne are all free in the casino I don't consider that a bonus. The buffet seriously, I would've been mad if I had paid full price but I still wasn't happy paying what the Groupon was worth. I waited an hour and a half after getting through a line and waiting to be seated. I then waited 15 min for the brunch buffet to be done so that I could eat the lunch buffet which was supposed to be better and wasn't, we left eating nothing. Everything was bad from the poor selection of food to their crab legs that were still frozen and mushy. If you gave me the buffet for free I still would've left this place not eating and would've chosen a Hometown buffet over eating there because they even have a better selection at Hometown buffet, and I don't even care for a Hometown buffet. I did inform the manager Joshua, of how felt and he was very apologetic and said had I not gotten a Groupon he would've refunded it. I've never asked for a refund from Groupon but I did on this one and I did refund it.  My suggestion is compare your buffet to other decent buffets and try to step it up. Definitely make sure that you don't put frozen products out to eat. If you can accomplish that I may try you again in the future because there are quite a few shows that I would like to see a Planet Hollywood, and it's a nice casino.",0,0,0

It certainly wasn't the worst buffet I have ever had but it is not on my top three! This was our first buffet stop while using the 24 hour buffet pass. 

The whole reason that we went to this particular buffet was because we wanted to have lunch at the Paris next door but the line was way too long. - Oh little did I know that the line that we saw was only the tip of the ice berg. There is a line to wait in line. Who does that!? - It reminds me of the line ride on The Simpsons! haha

Anyways... On to the review of the food. This is what should really matter! 

The sections were separated by the geographical region of the food. From what I noticed... this buffet likes to really stick with the most generic and popular food dishes for the given country. If you're looking for something a little more ""exotic"" then this is surely not the buffet for you. 

The food was bland for the most part. Nothing to really write home about. 

None of it was really too memorable for me other than the soft serve custard. I would have had more if I wasn't to full at that point in our meal. 

Eating here made us too full to face another buffet for dinner time while using our 24 our buffet pass. What a shame...

The first thing I noticed was the lack of clean beverage glasses. They were heavily spotted and a couple had food smears. The food was typical of most Vegas buffets. The prime rib was the best item. They also had mismatched food labels, probably from the night before. Yes, I know bacon when when I see it. But a couple of dishes I wasn't sure of, but the labels would say ""bbq ribs"" or ""fried chicken"" when the dish obviously wasn't either. I've had better and worse Vegas buffets.

Name it, they have it, from even Mediterranean to sushi, to Mexican. Their seafood selection and quality is amazing. Although, no lobster.  Dessert area has a variety of cakes, pies, and soft serve ice cream. They also have a crepe maker was very good.

What KO's all the elegant buffets I have been to like the Wynn and Bellagio is the price. $20 comparing to $35-40 at the other hotels for dinner is unbeatable especially for the similar dining selections. I guess if you are there for the ambiance and elegance like the Wynn or Bellagio then you should go there.

First I would like to begin with the fact that when a friend and I went to the section that said salads, there were no salads. No lettuce, no croutons no dressing. In fact there was potato salad, crab salad, macaroni salad but nothing that remotely looked like a normal plain green salad. Annoying? Yeah just a bit. I call that false advertising. We had to walk to the other side of the buffet to get a salad. 

Next we headed over to the meat section. The prime rib was over cooked. The inside was grey. My husband like it but no one else in our party. I'm more of a medium rare type of girl with the inside a bright red. There were ton of other options as well. There was lamb but I didn't try it. Instead I opted for the mediterranean chicken they had which was shaped into little balls with a red coating and green spices. It was delicious an extremely tender. I was going to go for some fried chicken but it was too greasy an wa literally sitting in a inch of grease in the pan. No thanks.

Then the next thing that caught my eye were these shrimp filled martini glasses. Adorable! Great eye catching presentation! Tasted good, but i dont know how anyone could mess up that anyway. 

Starting with my third plate I headed overto the warm crab leggs. It was nice to see them already prepared, cracked open and laying there. Super easy to eat and i loved them warm. Other buffets on the strip have them cold and i hate it. How hard is it to warm them?! The butter was in a cool and easy dripper that you could just grab a small coffee sized creamer cup and fill. The crab was okay, a little flavorless but i think it was because i got the last two crab legs in the pan. they would go so quickly that i had virtually no choice. There was already a line for the new pan so i thought what the hell, ill go for the last two, im tooooo hungry. They were good enough that I ate about 6 legs. Next on the plate I added some popcorn shrimp which was cooked to perfection. At other buffets i notice the popcorn shrimp becomes very mushy or soggy. No it was still crispy and full of flavor. It actually had some spice, hardy har har. 

My last and final dish was desserts. Here was the best part of the night. They actually have a lady that does fresh crepes. I was able to pick out the filling and toppings. Wooo. Thats what im talking about baby. My husband went with bananas and i couldnt help but resist the apple. The lady made it in seconds and topped ti with fresh whip cream and drizzles chocolate allover it. holly hell was it delicious. the warmth of the dish made it melt in your mouth. im giving a star just for the crepe. After that I went back for the rasphberry cheesecake. Perfectly one bite it wasnt too sweet or bitter. It left you wanting more but perfectly satisfied. With just a tiny bit of room left, yes i had to remove my belt.. No judging please.. I went with the tiramissu bite sized cake. Tiramissu? eeek, not so much. Don get me wrong it was yumdeliumpcious but it tasted more like coffee cake. 

Overall the only thing which i enjoyed to the fullet was desssert. This place needs more spice and much more improvement. I expected much more from PH. Will try again in the future for lunch to see if its a different experience.",1,1,0

You can read my fellow Yelpers reviews for the nitty gritty. I'm only going to review the crepe station.

You can choose from apples, strawberries, and bananas foster. I went for the bananas foster not once but twice. The crepes are loaded with bananas and topped with powered sugar. Chocolate syrup is drizzled on top.

Wow. If I had paid for this place, I would have been pissed. Service was excellent. I adored our server. She asked if we wanted a to-go cup of coffee. No one has ever offered that!

The juice was clearly from concentrate. The Mexican and Salad sections were closed. What? No Mexican breakfast? Those are the best dishes! 

Middle Eastern included bagels and lox. This was probably my favorite section. I forced fed myself lox with capers to get my money's worth. I liked the mozzarella and tomato salad, but it was something I could find at a supermarket deli. 

Dessert section looked like it was filled with mini packaged pastries. I selected a chocolate croissant, but it was flaky and dry, so I skipped it. 

On to the American section. There were 2 types of benedicts. They looked good, but I think they became overcooked from the heat lamp. The country style potatoes were good and surprisingly still crispy. I did however, find these potatoes repeated 2 more times. It also seemed like these were the seasoned potatoes you find in the freezer aisle. 

There was an omelet station, that I skipped. And I think a crepe station in the Dessert section. 

Stopped in the Asian section to get a squirt of sriracha. 

I stopped off for a cheese blintz, but never ate it. It was pretty burnt and didn't have much filling. The section also included French toast and pancakes?

There was a nice oatmeal\/cream of wheat section. Then, a fresh fruit section where you could construct your own parfait. 2 yogurt flavors, shredded coconut and granola? 2 smoothie options. They were really plain. I think one was banana, the other, strawberry. 

The final section included spinach and cheese egg scramble, but I didn't see any cheese or spinach. There were potato pancakes. And a turkey hash which had fingerling potatoes (yum) and roasted peppers. I took the time to dig out the pepper and fingerlings. This was one of the only things that didn't seem pre-made. And it was pretty good.  

I looked through the photos for lunch and dinner and they all look like a completely different restaurant! I don't know, guess they dropped the ball for breakfast. Kind of a shame for people like me who love breakfast.",3,0,0

Mimosas were so disgusting. They did have a small omelet station with 4 pans. The chef was only making one omelet to completion before starting another. Several angry people in line. Desserts were all stale and even the ice cream was runny and tasteless. I could not even put it in the sugar cones. This experience should have foreshadowed the food poisoning I got. By 3 o'clock I had to lay down and did not wake up till 10pm to be physically ill. This was all that I had eaten and I washed my hands\/ used hand sanitizer after playing machines.

Now I'm not the biggest lamb fan, but this lamb tasted even better than beef.  It was good!  As for the other stuff, they were very fresh and tasted better than most buffet places near the strip.  They actually taste like they cooked each dish for you and not in a big vat for 100 people.  They have lots of servers, so expect to have your drinks filled very fast and as courteous as possible.

It was great - my favorite is still the Wynn, but at this price point, this one rocks.  We came in at the end of breakfast (which goes until 10:30), so we had the benefit of both breakfast and weekend brunch selections.

I'm surprised there were so many comments about the food being cold.  I found everything at the right temperature.  The fresh fruit crepes were okay, and I loved the waffles.  Nice selection of traditional breakfast items, an omelet station and fresh fruit for those who are trying to be healthy.

Location is inside Planet Hollywood which was a convenient distance from our hotel Paris.  Interior is nothing fancy but the booth seat was comfortable.  We went around 6:30 and was seated right away, though shortly after they had a short line up.

I rarely complain unless deserved, so here is our experience on this night. Tuesday July 28th, got to Vegas and for our first dinner we went for our first meal here as we usually do on the Buffet of Buffet (24 hours of eating for $54.99 at most Harrah's properties), arrived at the cashier at 8 p.m. after waiting in line nearly an hour, nothing uncommon about a wait for this buffet, bought our 24 hour grazing pass, then waited in line another 30 minutes for a table, only to notice the sea of empty clean and empty dirty tables that were sitting idle. I think they may not be able to judge capacity and demand timing and are having serious problems in managing the dining room. After the long wait we were both beyond famished only to have what turned out to be the worst experience ever at this buffet for myself, a meat eater and my friend that is a seafood eater. I could not find one cut of beef or lamb that wasn't tough. The turkey breast was extremely dry and the gravy was thick, it obviously had been there for quite sometime and reduced to a consistency of a near mud-like lumpy property. The meat in the hamburger sliders were so hard it bent the knife I finally tried to cut them with. I admit on this night it was busy, with the tables of diners finally filling up as staff slowly cleared away the debris left by previous diners. Simply put, never have I seen such a mess as this buffet was and stayed during our visit. There also seemed to be a lack of serving staff as there was never any rice pilaf or vegetables at the American station and the only vegetable I finally ate was mashed potatoes, they had large raw chunks of potatoes that I had to use my napkin to remove from my mouth, the Salad station near the Mexican food station (I won't do the other salad station next to the Seafood station due to fish allergies) stayed out of romaine lettuce for the longest time, the cheese or breads were never stocked that I saw and went back for repeatedly and this area was extremely untidy more so than other stations that were dirty as well.  Speaking of the Mexican station, the food here was extremely old in appearance with many patrons including myself passed on by. Most items at the Italian station were empty as well, at which point I gave up to another let down and decided to get dessert. In my opinion, children under a certain age should be assisted by adults, especially when the restaurant doesn't provide tongs or other utensils to pick up food. The children were using their bare hands to pick up cupcakes and other items and then at times even placing them back on the dishes for other patrons. The only dessert I felt safe in consuming was a dish of flan that was well out of reach from being handled by bare hands. An over abundance of anise in two items; a mystery meat that tasted only of anise and then for dessert I had flan that had an extremely strong anise taste (did they have an anise catastrophe in the kitchen this night?). BUT, the most disturbing issue of the night my friend who eats here regularly with me, was concerned about the after effects of eating seafood here. An hour after eating, a quick trip to the room was deemed necessary (you get the idea). Hoping it was a one time experience, but am afraid to go back if someone feels queasy after eating here and the food was as it is on this night.",0,0,0

She stalled people, saying she couldn't check them out, then would send them to another register, only for folks to be turned away & come back.  Upon the hungry masses descending on her again, Veronica suddenly had to count change in her register.  When another lady showed at the next register and desperately starving people crowded around her, she loudly announced, ""I'm NOT a cashier.""  The service here is simply abhorrent prior to the meal.  Even the seating hostess we had the pleasure (displeasure??) of encountering couldn't deign to mumble a greeting. The actual food was alright.

Yes it was cool they have cotton candy as a dessert, but by the end of your meal, the last thing you want to stuff in your mouth is a fluff of sugar. I was also excited about the cheese they had, unfortunately most of the cheese was dried out and getting hard. Out of all the things I ate, the best thing there was the crab legs. They weren't too salty or watery like other buffets and I do like how they cut them in half so it's easier to get the meat out. Other than that, there was nothing special about the food.

First of all, after having been at the beautiful buffet at the Wynn the night before, the atmosphere here was really lacking. I almost kind of felt like I was in someone's basement. It was somewhat cafeteria-y. 

The service was terrible. I commend them for the nice idea of having a card on which you can make your drink selections, so you don't have to wait for your server to arrive before going up for food. But this seems to foster an attitude of complete disinterest for the servers. I think we may have interacted with our server once... or maybe not, not even sure if that was him. He seemed overworked and stressed out. 

The food here really wasn't bad actually, but it's hard to completely appreciate it in light of other negatives. That being said, this may be one of the better buffets for vegetarians. I really enjoyed the middle-eastern and Mexican areas.

The most famous thing in Vegas aside from the casinos and the shows is of course the buffets.  Every corner you turn on the strip, there is some huge neon sign advertising the cheap yet plentiful buffets.

On the higher-end side was the Spice Market Buffet - not much advertisement, it was just supposed to be a ""hidden gem"".  The price we paid was somewhere along expensive - $20+ for each person for dinner.  This was a fortune in Vegas when it came to buffet dining.  There must be some exotic and delicious food was the conclusion we came to.

The room was dimly lit.  There was plenty of walking room amongst the tables, probably to avoid head-on collisions amongst patrons.

The selection of food was paltry.  They were known to have ""international fare"" and yet at each of the distinguished stations, they had only a few items.

The ""Mexican"" section was the worst part (Iam of Mexican and Guatemalan decent) and was ashamed of the selection and quality of this section. It was horrible, the rice was  under cooked and did not look appetizing, typical tacos and fajitas had a ""Mediterranean"" Section which I didn't bother trying and Also a ""Seafood"" section which I don't eat seafood so didn't bother either. The service was just as bad as the food, we had to wait almost 10 min into our meal to get our drinks and our waiter was acting like we were bothering him for things! I literally sat for 20 min with 2 dirty plates in front of me before he can to pick them up and getting refills was like pulling teeth. But he was all smile and fast with a party of almost 18 people that had been seated a few feet away from us!

But now I'm a local and also a vegetarian, so I really don't eat at the buffets except when friends are in town.  Well wouldn't you know it, we had some friends in town recently and they wanted to go to Spice Market Buffet.  I honestly was pretty excited because I now had an excuse to come back.

So I don't know if I'm jaded as a local or if it's because my choices are severely limited since I can't eat 95% of the items, but I'm never really impressed with buffets anymore.  Spice Market, however, is still pretty good option in my option.  My friends (non-vegetarians) were happy with their meal.

As any vegetarian in Vegas knows, your choices at a buffet are very starch- and dairy-heavy, and Spice Market is no exception.  I had quesadillas, pasta with pesto sauce, mac 'n cheese, and whipped potatoes.  They did offer simple green beans and even some really yummy roasted veggies (asparagus, zucchini, onions) in the Italian section.  The Middle Eastern section has several veg-friendly choices, but be weary of the Moroccan vegetables- they had really bad seasoning and texture.  I enjoyed the desserts, but then again, I always enjoy the desserts.  The fruit tarts and cream puffs were my favorite.

Other things you can expect include: shrimp, soups, breadsticks, pizza, fajitas, several breads and spreads, sweet potatoes, cotton candy, and a dessert crepe station.

I think this is still a solid buffet, especially as a tourist.  The prices are reasonable (for a buffet on The Strip) and I even found a coupon online for $5 off (http:\/\/www.destinationcoupons.com\/Nevada\/Las_Vegas\/spice-market-buffet\/spice-market-buffet-coupons.asp).  Vegetarians, you can find enough to eat here (including a decent salad bar that I didn't even touch).  Vegans, I would say you need to avoid all buffets (too much dairy).

Let's start with crab legs - are you a leg man? The crab is succulent and sweet. Many other buffets have overboiled, tasteless crab, but these legs are SUPERB!  They also split the legs down the middle so shelling your crab is not the ordeal it usually is elsewhere. I think I ate half my body weight in crab, so if I appear to have a reddish hue, that may explain it.

Prefer racks rather than legs? The honey glazed rack of lamb melts in your mouth. Tender, juicy and doesn't have the overwhelming ""lamb"" taste that turns many away. I'm honestly not much of a lamb person myself, but I did come back for seconds!

Most buffets make you peel your own shrimp which frankly isn't worth the trouble, but here, it's peeled already!

And the prime rib is cooked perfectly, juicy, and the chef cuts a slice to your specifications.

It is $30 a person, but if got any of these items off of a set menu, the price per plate would approximate that anyway and you couldn't get seconds!

However I had to really look around to find anything else that was edible and really didn't have any success. The seafood other than the crab legs and shrimp looked bad. The Italian food looked like it had been sitting all day. The American station wasn't appealing at all. They did have flank steak on the craving station but I didn't try that because I had some kind of other beef from the middle Eastern station and it was really tough.

It was voted the Best Buffet in Vegas in 2007, so I had high expectations and an even HUGE(r) appetite for king crab legs...

I wanted to like the Spice Market Buffet because, well, it's a buffet! All you can eat baby! Yeah. 

So, we arrive and (1) the escalator on the way down to the buffet is broken. So everyone (senior citizens, parents teaching their children how to walk for the first time) was walking down the escalator VERY SLOWLY. OK, escalators are entitled to break down every once in a while, but during their 4pm Dinner rush hour? Hmmmm.

We pay for our buffets first and are quickly ushered to our seats near the seafood area. Nice! Upon obtaining our plates, there is a LONG (and slow-moving) LINE for the crablegs. Hmmm. What's the hold up? Oh, the people cutting in line in front of those of us patiently waiting... while the crab leg attendant does nothing to regulate...

We are seated and greeted by our lovely server who takes our drink orders and ensures we are comfortable. Nice.

My crab legs are a little too watery (poorly thawed) and VERY salty to say the least. But I continue consuming them... until after about 20 or so legs I am satisfied.

They also have various other foods some distinguished by ethnic group, and of course prime rib-- which was delicious.

here you can find american (carving stations, veggies, potatoes), asian (chinese\/japanese sushi), seafood, italian, mexican, mediterranean\/middle eastern...just about anything you're craving.  some buffets have a lot of variety but don't execute very well in terms of tastiness (like the rio in my opinion).  also, i don't like super expensive buffets like mandalay bay or bellagio that have foods that i just don't want to eat or don't recognize.  

i'm not a dessert person but...where else do you get cotton candy, flan and creme brulee??  this is the only place i've seen cotton candy...and it seems silly, but it's pretty cool walking out of there with cotton candy in your hand to accompany you.

There's so much food that it actually takes a while to walk from one end to the other.  Be sure to look for all the food stalls because you might miss it if you don't keep walking.

If you're a fan of king crab legs, this place is great because they cut the legs in half making it much easier to eat.  The shrimp tempura, one of my favorites, is perfectly crunchy, and if you like sushi, there's a good selection of rolls that aren't overstuffed with rice.  The fresh shrimp was a good size and perfect for dipping into cocktail sauce.

Like most buffets, there's the usual Mexican, Japanese, Italian, and Chinese areas, but also a Middle Eastern section.  Mmm.  Plenty of meat here if you like kabob, lamb and hummus.  The carving station also serves prime rib, turkey, and a bunch of other seasoned meats.  There's plenty of seafood like salmon and white fish, but there's also a wide variety of vegetables for the non-carnivorous.  There's also dedicated section for salad and another one for fruit.  There's a huge selection of desserts and they make crepes to order!  Kids will love the cotton candy maker.

 All the food is clean, fresh, perfectly labeled and nicely segmented.  This place will have all the food you'd expect to find at a buffet and so much more that it truly raises the bar.

The Groupon was a good deal especially since it came with the unlimited drinks deal.  The champagne was pretty good, and unlimited coronas was a nice touch, but how much can you drink, drinking lots of beer, wine, and champagne limits how much food you can eat. Now to the food... The food was bland and dry.  The portions the woman was carving at the carving station made me even hungrier, by the fourth time I went to her station I just asked for 4 times the regular amount.  The only decent items at this buffet were the beef from the carving station, the pesto pasta, and the fajitas.  The rest of the food was take a bite and leave the rest type of food.  The desserts were the worst part of all.

The food was spectacular. If they have it, try the lamb skewer. I'm not a fan of lamb but it was next to the beef so we decided to grab it. Best lamb ever - hands down! They have a wide variety of food and if you love seafood then you'll love this place. The king crab legs were the best I've seen.

I went to a time share presentation where we were lied to for two hours with their so called low pressure sales (all lies), but we were rewarded with two buffet dinners here at the The Spice Market.

The highlights:

The prime rib.  Best I have had at a buffet. Ever.
Sweet potatoes. Yum!
Crab legs. Presliced! Couldn't find any butter for it, but still great.
Flan.
Mushroom ragout.
Shrimp tempura
Veggies with the big carrots
Dessert bar, complete with cotton candy and ice cream self serve.

Brisket. No taste.
Creme brulee

I rate Paris next in line. One way to know is how they make some of their food. For instance, the creamed chipped beef and corned beef hash are all made fresh. While at Harrahs, and the others, it is from a can. The Flamingo has gone up in standards a bit, but Harrah's and Paris have gone down hill some. If you are going to do the 24 hour buffet I would do PH as your main choice to eat. 

For dinner, they have the best choices of all the other buffets and really do the crab legs well with both warm and cold legs. They also have peel and eat shrimp already peeled for you. That little step saves a ton of mess and time. It is worth the crab legs just to eat there. 

Service is friendly and the staff were attentive to us. If you are Diamond or Platinum they make sure you are taken care of right away.

No line at 930pm. They are open till 11pm and dinner is $30. It wasn't as good as I remembered it to be. I've eaten here many times before... but years ago. They have crab legs for dinner... but it's cold. However, later I saw people asking for it steamed, so I guess you can get it warmed up as well. The prime rib here was good - tender and juicy. The variety of food is not as vast... but food is not bad.  I guess many places are copying Wicked Spoon and doing small individual portions because they had some items served like that here. The fried rice, fried chicken, and shrimp cocktail I got were in individual servings. I thought the fried rice was pretty good and that the Asian selections did taste ""Asian"" lol. They had Asian chicken wings... and they did taste like how I marinade them at home. The BBQ pork buns were quite good as well but very soft! The bun falls apart very easily! The fried chicken was also juicy and tasty. 

I was not too big on the desserts here... but they do have a large selection of cupcakes! However, the cupcakes are typical size cupcakes, so it makes it harder to try more flavors. I like mini-cupcakes because you can try more. I also got a crepe, but the crepe itself is pre-made. They warm it up and fill it with whatever you want. if you want good FRESH made crepes, the Paris buffet is the way to go. 

I would eat here again if I was doing the buffet of buffets deal... but probably not if I was paying full price for the buffet itself.

Me and my boyfriend decided to go here on a whim because we got hungry and were closest to Planet Hollywood.  We had heard good things about SMB from other people and we decided to break our one buffet in Vegas rule to try it.  We were excited to  it was a few bucks cheaper than some of the other buffets on the strip and offered a discount if you join the players club for Planet Hollywood.   

The line didn't seem very long when we got there but it tripled well we were waiting for a table.  It was a Sunday night in March.  I can't imagine this place on a Friday or Saturday.  This made me even more excited to try it.  Why would it be so busy if it wasn't good???  

It took 30 minutes to get a table that was practically in the walkway. Not very relaxing trying to eat dinner and feeling like you're in the way of traffic.  There were other open tables available I don't know why a place would seat us in such an awkward spot.  It was nice there was a card to fill out for drink orders so we didn't have to wait for the server.  We went for it and both filled our first plate up.  I was disappointed to come back and find no one had come by to get our drink order.  We started eating anyway.  We both had gotten through our first plate by the time our drink order was taken.  I was so thirsty.  This was not the servers fault.  They were clearly waaaay understaffed.  Our poor server was literally sprinting back and forth between tables dripping in sweat.  I made sure to tip him a few dollars  before we left.  I'm sure tipping isn't well practiced in buffets but I think it should be.  The food was mostly greasy fried food. Overcooked or cold and terrible quality.   Our plates stacked up next to us and no one came to clear them.The atmosphere was similar to a school cafeteria with framed movie posters on the wall.    I get that it's a buffet but when places like Wicked Spoon are only $10 more and so much better overall why would I ever come back here???

About and hour after we ate I got extreme stomach pains and felt awful.  It almost kept me in for the night but luckily the Venetian Apothecary revived me with medicine and after a few drinks I was ready to head out :)  My boyfriend felt fine* but I'm not gonna chance ever eating here again.

Decided to try this place because it was conveniently located since we were staying in the Planet Hollywood Casino (formerly Aladdin Casino) and they gave guests a $5 coupon off per person to encourage ppl to try it. Was highly doubtful of the quality and selection of the food even though it was voted ""Best Vegas Buffet"" by what sounded like some bogus Vegas magazine. However, we were very impressed and satisfied by the huge selection (even more than Bellagio buffet) and the quality and taste of the food (on par if not better than the Bellagio buffet).

The Spice Market restaurant does not look as elegant as the Bellagio Buffet, but it was much bigger with so many more food stations. Offerings included:
- Breakfast - fresh waffles and fresh omelettes made-to-order were awesome
- Asian - the chinese pork buns were so soft and fantastic, sushi, etc.
- Bakery - so many breads and pastries, including focaccia etc
- Middle Eastern - this was very different and had things like tandoori chicken, hummus, etc.
- American - standard comfort foods
- Italian - included lobster pasta
- Seafood - salmon, seafood and chicken paella, etc.
- Desserts - soft-serve ice cream CUSTARD was so creamy and delicious, freshly made cotton candy, and a zillion other desserts that looked so good. Even more desserts than Bellagio.
- Salads - many different options
- Carving - prime rib, lamb, many others
- Mexican - meats, sides, condiments to make your own fajitas\/tacos but the meats were hard from sitting in the heat too long

Hint: find a $5 per person discount coupon somewhere. The Planet Hollywood casino front desk may be able to provide one if you are not staying there.

Bottom line: Food here was suprisingly good for a buffet and much better and cheaper than the Bellagio buffet. And there was a very short line - forget the long line at Bellagio and give this place a try. You mught come out very pleasantly surprised like we were.",0,0,0

But that's another review for another time). We decided to show up early (12:30) to pick up the VIP tickets and take a walk around the Miracle Mile Shops. All of a sudden, our 9 year old daughter says that she is hungry and I opted to get the family a nice treat. Besides, I had not eaten here since it was the Aladdin. As we approached the buffet, we were pleasantly surprised to find that the line for lunch was fairly reasonable for midday weekday lunch.

Much to my surprise, nothing had changed about this place except for some cosmetic touches to the dining area. The salad section had fresh bamboo shoots and whole peeled beets (score!). There were so many sections to choose from that I did not want overdo it on one section.

The seafood section was pretty good. The sushi looked OK but it
s buffet sushi.  The highlight of the station is the crab meat stuffed sole and paella. Delicious and well seasoned.  The Middle Eastern section was to die for with flavorful hummus, naan bread, tandoori chicken and chicken curry. The tabouleh salad and the curry sauce were good as well. The only meh part of the meal was the shrimp Pad Thai. Since I am 1\/2 Thai, I did not expect a Vegas buffet to perfect Thai cooking like they do here in the LA area where I live. Could have used a little more tamarind, but I like my Pad Thai a little tangy than most. I'll give the cooks an A for effort since they used the right type of rice noodle (Sen Lek).  If I wanted Thai food, I'd go to a Thai restaurant.   There were many places to hit but the stomach only has so much room.  Unless I wanted to relive the scene from Monty Python's movie ""The Meaning of Life.""  (I'll refrain from spoiling the scene)

Our 9 year old loved the dessert buffet. The fresh spun cotton candy was the highlight for her. I took a bite and it was pretty good. The flan was delicious and the cannolis were pretty good as well. I like the Orleans' cannolis better at the French Market Buffet but the Spice Market's were not bad. No pecan pie that I could see but that's not a deal breaker. My wife had the bread pudding and said it was OK.

Will definitely come back and eat another meal at this buffet. Next time we'll try to see if we can get in at the tail end of lunch so we can try some of the dinner items when they change from lunch to dinner.

It is located after about a half mile walk from self parking through the Miracle Mile Shops past the casino, so be ready for this.

After getting a seat, you have to take a few seconds to see where to go for which food station you might want. There are always a lot of people eating here so decide if you want American or Mexican food for instance first. A plan will help you out.

I visited the American, Asian and Italian sections. Almost everything I had was sufficiently hot with the exception of a few. I expect that the food, once it is put out, is almost immediately consumed, so the food should be consistently hot. I enjoyed some of the premium food options over other buffets in Las Vegas. I would hope so as the price is in the upper range, near what some of Vegas' five star resorts charge for their dinner buffet. The best idea is to go for the wristband option from Caesar's Entertainment Corp. Thanks to Caesar's Entertainment Corp for supplying me with a buffet wristband to test a few out.

The girlfriend and I visited because we had a Groupon (probably should have been the first hint) and and we didn't feel like cooking. We read the reviews before we bought the Groupon. I just thought the bad reviews came from those who were a little too picky (I was wrong.) So we went with a clear mind, willing to give this place every chance it deserves. 

Service (scale from 1-5, where 5 is excellent) - 1

We arrived, and walked up to the cashier. Boy, she must have been having a bad day; not the attitude I expect from a restaurant. No smile, no hospitality whatsoever. Kinda made me feel like I want wanted there. Anyways, I got over it, we stood and waited for the host to show us to the table. Her attitude was not much better. Ugh, not a good start. We waited about five minutes before our server came and took our drink orders. I swear, there must be a theme to this restaurant or something. She looked like she was barely tolerant of our existence. Expected so, the worst service I have ever experienced. We hardly saw here throughout the dinner. Even when she saw us waving her over, she would ignore it. 

Food - 2

Now let's get to the food. Oh...the food. The only thing that was good there were the crab legs, the shrimp cocktail, and the charcuterie. That's because you can't really mess that up. Everything else was just downright bad. The prime rib was completely overcooked and tough. The baby back ribs were overcooked and hard. The bread they served were rock hard. Pretty much nothing in their hot stations that we had were very appetizing. We hate to waste food but sadly, most of the plates that we got were full when they took it away. We read that the saving grace is the dessert station. Not necessarily. Well, they do have frozen custard, which is the best thing there. They also have a Macaron cookie which was done pretty well. They have maybe ten varieties of cupcakes, and are way too sweet in my opinion. The fruit tart, stale. The crepes in the crepe station are pre-made packaged. 

Value - 4

I give this a four given that the deal was from Groupon; $35+ for two people, alcohol included. 

All in all, a pretty horrible experience, which prompted me to leave a review. I think they should seriously look into the service part of the establishment. It can make or break an experience, and on this occasion, it shattered it beyond repair.",10,0,0

It really is a below average Vegas buffet. Looked at all th food sections and they all looked mediocre at best. It's edible but for the money, almost anywhere else is better.

The seafood section looked ""old"". Was afraid to eat anything there in fear of getting sick. It just didn't look good at all. Prime rib was chewy. Food trays were either near empty or full. Meaning anything decent was almost gone or the full trays were bad tasting.

Either way, I'm definitely not eating hear again. Sorry PH, not trying to bad-mouth you but I had a really bad experience eating here.",0,1,0

There's a large variety of different cuisines which is always convenient when you're in a large group with different tastes. I highly recommend the brunch version too so that there's the added choice of breakfast food and endless mimosas are best at midday.,0,0,0

As far as the food goes I had some really impressive salads (a fruit one comes to mind). I liked the entree options but nothing was that memorable. Pretty standard Vegas buffet food.

The one problem that I was that my boyfriend added on the all you can drink (wine, beer, etc) option. We each ordered a beer (he was brought the wrong one, but just decided to drink it), his second he finally got the one he wanted, but this is where it went bad. He went to get another plate of food so I ordered his 3rd beer for him. It took 30+ minutes to get it which included being brushed off at the cashier station and then having to get the manager involved. The manager said he would talk to the waitress, but no real action was taken. I never went back up to try any of the deserts because I was at the table hoping we would get our drinks while he was having to actually leave the table to get served. I even contacted them when we got home and was told that they would give me a priority reservation the next time I went to the buffet. 

My advice is if you eat there do not add the all you can drink option. I don't know if they only want to allow you to have 2, then they should call it $11.99 for 2 drinks. I am sure people would still order that. 

There are a lot of options in Vegas so I will not be returning to this buffet. I may never stay at this hotel because of the level of non-customer service that we received which is a shame because it was an option for our upcoming trip.",3,0,0

We waited in line upstairs in the casino only to make it down the escalator to wait even longer in what looked like a holding pen for livestock.  The food was not good.  Most of the displayed food looked dry and flavorless but, in fact, they did have flavor!  It was the flavor of really low-quality buffet food!  The only tasty item was the chocolate-filled crepes topped with peaches and a berry sauce.  They make them fresh at the dessert station.

I'm kinda trashy in that I harbor a shameful enjoyment in Vegas buffets, but if you need to go to one, I suggest the one at the Mirage.",1,0,0

We were in line for a good hour before being taken down to the buffet via an escalator to wait another half hour. I thought the food must be outstanding to wait this long. The average price per person paid was $30, which I thought was reasonable for a Vegas buffet dinner. 

Food galore! There were may food stations for different types of cuisines from all over the world--Asian (I loved the dim sum items!), Mexican, American, Indian...the selection was pretty sweet. The dessert station was pretty crowded most of the time because the made-to-order-crepes were a hit. I wasn't able to get a crepe for myself, but there were many other desserts lying around that I got to sample, like cheesecakes, chocolate cakes, brownies, etc. They were pretty good, nothing spectacular--just your garden-variety dessert you can get anywhere in a decent restaurant. The prime rib was juicy and big, but nothing fantastic. The salad bar was pretty decent as well, and the king crab legs were really good, too. 

Service was friendly, and our drinks were refilled on a timely matter. The ambiance of the dining rooms felt casual and homely, and the tables were spaced out well so as to avoid elbowing other people from another table. I felt comfortable. 

Overall, the buffet was pleasantly decent for the money. I stuffed myself silly. I had five full plates of food! The food wasn't something you'd get from a place with a Michelin award. It's yummy food to fill your empty stomachs with. I'm pretty sure anyone will walk out of the buffet feeling satisfied with good food for a good value.",0,0,0

I guess after Planet Hollywood took over they could care less about the buffet. Our server forgot about us for a good 20 minutes.Same menu as before, crab legs, Chinese food, roast beef, chicken, lamb, beef kabob, pasta, pizza. Dessert is a joke now.

Armed with a travelzoo voucher, we headed to champagne brunch without any particular expectations. First of all, Maritza ( or possibly Maricella) was our server, and the best server we had in buffet setting during our visit to Vegas. Our glasses never went empty. We worked our way in a clockwise fashion. stuffed sole and peel and eat shrimp were the highlight of the otherwise uninteresting seafood section. Onto a yummy looking italian section where i sampled meatballs that would make my Nonna hang up her apron. a huge breakfasty section was mostly avoided- except for some eggs benedict , egg itself was a bit firm for my taste, and partner had a lovely supercheesy beef slider. My favorite part of the buffet was strangely the tabouli. It was the best tabouli i had ever had in my life... fresh and light and perfectly lemony. hummus was good, dolmas good. Why on earth would you put pita in a basket labeled Naan? shaking my head here. Tandoori style chicken while good, lacked traditional flavor. High quality olives were available near the imported meats and cheeses, I missed this station initially starting from the other side. Don't miss this station, everything besides the mortadella was primo. I would also like to give the pastry chef a big ole hug. Most of the other buffets we went to had the same exact stuff; i'm guessing that the MGM properties make all of their desserts in the same place and have them delivered so Spice Market was a real treat. Was particularly smitten with the angel food cupcake with a mini canoli popping out of the top, i can still taste it- simply amazing. I had a few other bite size treats but wow, that cupcake was the star...
