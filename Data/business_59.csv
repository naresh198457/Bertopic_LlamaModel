We rented two rooms and to begin with the carpets were filthy in the room and hallways, one room the sofa a ripped lining which hung on the floor. The alarm clock made this really weird humming noise and I had to unplug the makeup mirror was broken and had no light as well as the base was broken so it listed to one side. When you flushed the toilet the outside sink gurgled for a few minutes. I asked for two non-smoking rooms and one stunk of cigarette smoke.

I stayed at the Rio for three days and one of my rooms was not cleaned for two consecutive days. When I called housekeeping they tried to say that we were in the room too long in the morning but we were up and out by 11AM each day. The Rio has two pools one with a waterfall and another that is heated were kid mainly enough themselves. This pool was absolutely disgusting. The white tile had a filthy black ring around it. Once I returned home I completed a survey sent to me by the Rio and I heard nothing but once I posted a review such as this one on Trip Advisor I was contacted by the Total Rewards depart offering me an upgraded room the next time I visited. 

This tells me that they in fact had cleaner and better maintained rooms if you pay extra, otherwise you get filth, no housekeeping services and tattered furniture. I would have to be out of my mind to throw good money behind bad. Keep in mind that the Rio ""All Suites"" Hotel and Casino is owned by Caesars Entertain who also own Caesars Palace, Paris, Bally the Quad and a number of other ""Strip"" properties. It's clear to me that the Rio is there ""Ghetto"" property where they clip poor unsuspecting tourists who are trying to save a few dollars while on vacation. 

Since my return I have done extensive research on this property and the vast majority of the negative reviews are consistent with the property being a poorly maintained dump. Don't believe the glitz and glamour that you see on the Discovery Channel this place truly sucks and management knows about it.

You can sit it in your hotel room, far away from the Strip, and ponder whether it is a good business decision for the Rio to sell overpriced food at their restaurants. Doesn't that just remind people how far away they are from the cheaper food on the Strip? Should they be using the Madison Square Garden concession model when they don't have the Knicks? Then you can stare at your bathroom door and wonder why an outfit which runs and expensive Mardi Gras sky show can't paint the door and replace the broken door stop. You will have a lot of time to think, because after the Penn and Teller show, there is nothing else to do.",0,0,0

Told friends we were staying at the Rio and comments ranged from ""I heard that was a great place to stay a long time ago"", to ""aren't they going to close the Rio?"", to ""why?""

Flash back with me to 1990.  I heard nothing but people visiting Vegas talk about the VooDoo Lounge, on the 51st floor, the shocking cocktail waitress outfits here, the amazing huge suites, and the masquerade in the sky carnival show.

Well, the VooDoo lounge is not as exclusive, trendy, or fancy as it used to be, but it's not trying to be.  Still cannot beat that view at night.  It can get windy, but it's amazing.

The shocking cocktail waitress thongs have been covered up, as trends do, although the lacy negligee black lace outfits are still very sexy.  The suites were nothing if you've stayed at the Venetian, or in a suite at Caesar's Palace, but it did look like the bathrooms had been remodeled, as they were in modern granite, and very very, like superbly clean.  Not a speck or indication of use anywhere.  

Speaking of bathrooms, the ones here have a strange square window portal where you can see right in.  Not sure who came up with that bright idea, but it skeeved me out to think people visiting could see me on the potty or in the shower.  Anyway.  

Check in was a breeze, even though there was a line.  There are so many deals that even the front desk was confused.  Ours, booked through the hotel's specials page, included two 24 hour buffet wristbands, for two days, for two people.  

And use those wristbands we did, eating four meals a day.  The buffet here (the regular one, not the seafood one, which we did not try) is amazing, especially the mongolian bbq\/teppanyaki stations.  Lots of fresh cut vegetables, and a little of everything - sushi, italian, chinese, salad bar, etc.  

Everything except the Palms is a major hike from here.  There is a shuttered strip club across from the Rio, which is funny to look at.  I imagine there are cobwebs covered with glitter inside.  

The outside of the building has peeling glass film, which is U-G-L-Y.  They need to renovate that.  

And, as others have mentioned, the Masquerade in the Sky has gone to that big place in the sky where floats and showgirls dwell, long ago -- it is no longer. 

They do have some of the cocktail servers get up on platforms near the slot machines and dance.  I think they do that some other places, and it's strange, but also a welcome vibe among the quiet seniors pulling slot handles.

Amazingly, the pool here is fantastic.  Actually four pools, one of which is adult... I mean ""European""... I mean topless or whatever the euphemism is these days.  It is basically ""toptional"", so no kids, and whether you wear a top or not is up to you.  

Enjoyed the shuttle to the other Caesar's properties, including Bally's, Paris Las Vegas, Harrah's, and Caesar's Palace.  That saved a lot of driving or taxicab fare. 

WiFi is included in your resort fee, but is for ONE device.  So if you connect your tablet, forget your computer or phone.  Ice buckets worked fine, and housekeeping was on it with extra towels and other items needed.  

Two towers here, the Masquerade tower, where we stayed, and I think the Carnival Tower, which is a little closer.  Masquerade tower is a slight walk, but not too bad.  Burger King Bar (which was not visited) and the Chippendale's show are on this tower's side.  

We did see Penn and Teller, which was packed, even though parts of it was the same show I saw 10 plus years ago.  But it was a great great show nonetheless. 

The best part was the view of the lightning, thunderstorms, and lights of las vegas from our room on the 31st floor.",8,4,4

I am talking about .... ah never mind.... it was a fkin nightmare. The Indian restaurant's food was good but unbelievably over-priced.... seriously over-priced.

My mom and a few co-workers said Rio has the best seafood buffet so how could I go wrong ? So I couldn't wait to eat at this buffet and I was thinking it would be better then Valley View Casino in San diego.

So I knew it would be a little pricey at about 50 bucks and I was fine with that. I got there and the cashier said I could take a look around just to see if I would like it. So I did and I didn't see any lobster claws but I did see some lobster tails about the size of your pinky finger. That just blew my mind but I was hungry and I did want seafood so I just stayed there.

They had a lot of cold crab which I've never been a big fan of but they did have warm crab also. The buffet was a little small for my taste but that's alright. There was Asian food, Mexican and American but for the price it just didn't measure up. I order a lemonade and it was terrible the only things that I liked was the warm crab and some of the desserts. 

I wouldn't really recommend this buffet because it's way to pricey, they have small lobster tails that didn't even taste good and it's kind of small.",10,4,2

We had tickets to see Penn and Teller Friday night and had heard from my mother that the seafood buffet at the Rio was good, so we decided to come here for dinner, show, gambling. The hotel itself was quite nice, but packed with families(which I always find odd for Vegas). There were these circus like contraptions floating up above our heads with people dancing inside of them and throwing down beads like at Mardi Gras w\/out boobies showing. The women were scantily clad and the men were topless (nice bodies I might add). It was a fun show to popular music and I am sure the powers that be get amused seeing people crawling on the floor for cheap ass beads...anyway.

We played table games here-a little Let it Ride and some 3\/5\/7. Neither of us had much luck, so when it was time to go to our show, we were happily able to leave the table. After the show, I decided to check out their poker room. I played for a couple of hours and left with the same amount of money I bought in for. There was a terribly intoxicated jerk across from me who got his panties all in an uproar because someone river-ed him against his pocket 8's. What a jerk. The casino host should have recognized his level of intoxication and escorted him out of the poker room, but I am sure the regulars (locals) were enjoying taking his money just a little too much.

I would come back here again, but not any time soon.",6,4,4

Hotel rooms are reasonably priced, uber\/lyfts or shuttles to the strip are convenient, Chippendales is here (for those that indulge in male reviews) and the buffet is still just as good. They consolidated the seafood and combined it with the carnival world buffet and made that vacated spot into a cool putt putt golf area and arcade which is fun for the kids and immature adults.

I'm a players club member and found the gals working the players desk to be the uneducated on the rules and no help with my free play questions.

Price: It's definitely cheaper than most hotels on\/near the strip especially for the size of the room that you're getting. But BEWARE, they charge extra $30 per person per night for anything more than 2 people staying in the same room.

Parking: Free. It's one of the remaining few hotels on\/near the strip that do not charge for parking.

Room: It's big and the beds are comfortable. Other than that, the room is very outdated - carpet has tears and looks dirty, pull out couch is broken and looks like it hasn't been cleaned\/replaced in 20+ years, mirror near the bed had hand marks... you get the picture.

Check-in: Fast and easy. I received an email saying I could check in online so I did. Got there around 2 pm and our room was ready. They didn't charge for early check-in fee (I made sure to ask about that).

Since Oprah ended up doing a show with Cher and Tina Turner, Caesar's Palace overbooked 200 rooms.  They ended up kicking out all the people who had family discounts and put them in sister hotels.  They told us that the Rio rooms were nice and since everything was comped, we didn't have much to complain about.

The room did end up being very nice and the restaurant inside wasn't bad either.  The pool however, was nasty.  They had music and a bar closeby which was nice, but the chairs were dirty and had bird poop all over them.  The water was freezing and the bottom of the pools were stained brown.  Yuck.  Thankfully we had access to the Caesar's pool...so we only had to endure that pool for one day.

Parking: So easy and quick. we decided to park in the structure and it was no prob to park and take the mini bridge to the hotel. 

Check-in: My bf did have a little trouble checking in because the reservation was under a different name, but once the manager stepped in everything was great. 

Room: I was expected horrible but the room was actually pretty great. Sure is need to be updated a bit but overall it was clean, spacious, and nice. We did have a fridge in the room, the bathroom was huge, and OMG the beds... aammaazziinngg i slept like a baby. 

Pool: The pool was fun and our waitress was very nice and friendly. Drinks were of course not cheap because its Vegas but they were very good. The only thing i did not like is the fact that you cant take your own drink to the pool. All the other hotels I have stayed at usually allow one drink. 

Food: We only had lunch at the ""Sports Grill"" i think that is what its called well the pizza was delicious .. we had it two days in a row. 

Service: The staff was great and friendly i didnt have a bad experience with anyone.

We also ate at the Carnival  Buffet and although the food was decent, the service was terrible. The women seating and serving you are robotic and don't care. I asked the front desk to borrow a scissors for one minute to open a medicine I needed and they refused. So much for customer service.

It was off the strip but right across from the Palms and those amazing clubs they have over there.  The rooms were very inexpensive compared to other hotels and the staff was really nice.

It's gone pretty far down hill from that point in the last couple of years.  We had friends staying there and ever though we usually stay at the Palms we decided we'd join them at the Rio this trip.  WOW, big mistake.  We went to check in at 3pm and were told that they were sold out and the room we booked wasn't available so we could wait until 6pm or accept another room without a view in the older tower.  We thought... ok this can't be that bad and took it.  Keep in mind we booked our rooms a month prior.  When we got to our room we noticed the smell of something chemical, almost like paint..  It was strange.  Couldn't figure out what it was but decided to forget it by grabbing a beer from the mini bar.  Well, upon picking up the beer we noticed it wasn't at all cold.  The mini bar power light was on and the lights inside worked but it wasn't actually cold.  Since we already picked up the beer the little magnetic thing charged us.  We called the front desk about it and were told we needed to come down to speak with someone.  Really?  

I proceeded to go downstairs and was almost killed by a lady in a motorized scooter.  That was a freak thing and in the end we laughed about it.  Then I got out of the elevator on the lobby level and almost got hit by 2 more of these seniors in scooters while walking to the front desk.  It turns out they rent those scooters there and everyone seems to have one.  It was like walking around on a live go-cart track.

In the end we re-booked at the Palms and got the manager to refund us everything.  She was very apologetic and even expressed frustration about the scooters.  You could tell she didn't like those things either.

Even after all that I would have given them a 3 stars because management really did try and make it right and in the end I got a refund.  The reason I'm dropping this to a 2 star is because after I left the lobby I went to the valet to get my car and no joke, it took them 35 minutes to get our car !  I went back to the booth 2 times asking why it was taking so long and was told each time that there were reward club members automatically ahead of us because that's a perk of being park of their players club thing.  So while I was waiting every person that came after me for the next 25 minutes were apparently part of the reward club and they didn't even try to get my car.  Only after I started yelling at the guy and getting very loud did they magically have the time to get my car.

http:\/\/www.lasvegassun.com\/news\/2013\/dec\/02\/health-department-norovirus-caused-100-sicknesses-\/

Most of my family contracted the norvovirus while at the Rio over this last weekend.  Now, I understand that the Rio isn't to blame for all of this.  However, the way that they handled the outbreak was so classless and cheap that I will never patronize this hotel again. 

My boyfriend and I got sick Friday night and assumed it was food poisoning.  However, then my sister, who hadn't ate with us, got sick on Saturday morning.  I noticed that the cleaning staff had started wearing medical masks that morning as well.  Finally, because we were all sick in bed, we saw this story on CNN and called down to the hotel.  They confirmed the virus and said it didn't make sense to leave because we were already sick and contagious.  The hotel didn't issue a statement until Saturday afternoon.  The hotel had known that these kids who spread the virus were sick as of Friday morning.  

The Rio took steps to notify and protect their staff before their guests.  Had we been given the information earlier, we very well may have left before we were able to get sick.  It absolutely ruined our trip.  Even after you're down with the stomach flu portion of the virus, you are incredibly tired and achey for the next day or so after.  So, we weren't really able to leave the hotel.  

Further, the Rio was absolutely rude about extending our check out time.  Our plan had been to check out on Sunday, leave our stuff in my mom's room, and go to the strip until our flight at 5.  My boyfriend was still pretty bed bound Sunday morning.  I asked the hotel for a check out extension because we were sick with this stomach flu and couldn't really leave the hotel.  They would only extend it for a short time and said I had to come down in person for an extension until 5.  I explained to them that I had minimal sleep and needed to shower and really didn't feel like hiking it to reservations - they wouldn't budge.  I showered and went downstairs and the lady in reservations was so unpleasant.  Her exact words to me were ""I don't see what your issue could be, you already have late check out."" 

Lastly, the Rio never offered any kind of compensation for the hassle we went through.  Now I know they don't have to, but they were fully aware of how awful this virus is and knew the guests who had it wouldn't be able to enjoy their stay.  Hotels give out rooms and gambling credits like candy in Vegas.  It would have been the classy thing to do.

So I've seen far more than I ever wanted to of their various conference rooms, etc. I do have to admit, though, that the whole conference \/ meeting area isn't so bad - well taken care, good restrooms, and easy access to outside.

The restaurants are lackluster, the pool is ok, the rooms are whatever, there are male cocktail servers, the show in the sky thingy is fun to do once, the random girls dancing around the casino floor on platforms are amusing, etc.

However, I can never set foot in the Rio without thinking of one particular night a couple years back - and this pretty much sums up what the Rio is like. Left unattended when my friend went to the restroom, I was approached, whilst sitting at a slot machine playing (and wearing a rather conservative outfit), and asked ""how much?"". Yeah, seriously. I move to another location. Same guy, same question. Move again. Same thing. Move to the bar and tell the bartender. ""Oh yeah, that guy. He does that all the time. That's just kind of what happens around here."" I was at a loss for words.

So yeah, can't say I would go out of my way to patronize the Rio. However, I can't really quite give it just 2 stars either. And hey, if you are in the market for a lady of the night, I guess the Rio is the place for you to prowl.",2,2,0

They were the first to have all their rooms super sized and hence called all their rooms ""suites"".  The rooms are pretty generous with their sizing. The rooms we stayed in this trip have been redone, but many are still looking tired and old.  

The hotel was in quite a disarray when we arrived as there were two fires in the masquerade tower the previous day and the sprinklers had flooded many of the rooms making them unavailable to use. They placed many of the guests that were supposed to stay here, but were relocated to other Ceasars properties on the strip. 

Considering all the craziness we were still able to get our room located in the Ipanema tower, as that tower was unaffected by the fire situation.  

The drink service on the floor was very lackluster as many of the servers decided to call out and were not replaced.  

Overall, many of the Caesar's properties lack the general routine maintenance with their pending bankruptcy still not resolved. 

Many of the hotels are now charging parking on the strip. Things are changing here in Vegas and it's just not the same as it used to be. It may be best to just avoid all strip properties and get a bit more of a bang for your buck.",9,8,8

Double beds, comes with a small living room area, a restroom and a separate additional sink\/closet area. Like typical (finding a trend here)vegas hotels, we found the housekeeping to be mediocre! Found a lot of trash and wrappers under the bed and other hidden places. 
The pool area offers many pools which divides the crowd and I like that. The beach area is nice but rough sand and freezing cold water but nice shade and waterfall. The pool closes early- at 6 pm!! Probably because by that time the whole place is shady, lost all the sun to keep the pools warm.
Buffet is decent, we purchAsed the 24 hrs buffet. However, front staff aren't knowledgeAble of the hours of the buffet so we missed breakfast bc they told us it didn't open until 11 when in fact they did serve breakfast from 8-11!! They also gave us the run around when we inquired about prices of the buffet. They really have zero clue until u reach the front counter of the buffet but there isn't a direct line and no one offered to connect us for the right answers. 
If you enjoy zip lining, they offer that from one rio building to the next. Very high but you're sitting in a seat with a partner.
The arcade area is KISS theme, the rock band. There's also miniature golfing available but mostly adults play in the game room. There isn't much to do in this hotel if you have young kids other than swimming and buffet. 
I do recommend getting the pina colada for $11 at the buffet because it comes with a souvenir cup and tastes perfect! They offer the same cup and drink at the pool for double the price $25 and refills are $12- ridiculous! So get the cup from buffet for $11 And then u can bring it to the pool for refills during your whole stay! 
Overall, it is a good stay. This place does not charge for parking (yay to that!) and offers free shuttle to harrah's and paris. However service for valet and bell desk are slow compared to other hotels.",0,0,0

I made the best decision by staying here, because the rooms were renovated and there were a lot of new additions that have happened such as new restaurants, an added zip-line, etc.

Let's start with before check in, you're immediately harassed by some person in a tux trying to get you to sit in on a time share seminar or something. Mind you they're in the most trafficked areas like the check in and the elevators and they'll try to harass you every day. Check in\/out is exceptionally horrendous with at most 2 to 3 clerks working it at any given time. You WILL wait at least 30 mins before seeing one of them. Our initial room was trash, there was a hole in the wall where the door stopper should be, the door latch was coming off its hinges so I'm sure someone with enough force could've opened the door, and finally they apparently had an issue with their water systems and shut off all the hot water to our room and some others. The desk clerk (the 3rd one I called) was completely clueless as to why we still didn't have hot water (when she was assured by the ""engineer"" that we had hot water) switched us to a new room. So I had to go down to the main area to get a new key card and behold, the problems continue with all 8 elevators not working at all. I had to climb down 8? flights of stairs and then go through the entirety of the fire escape route to get out of the building and walk all the way around the complex to get back to the main entrance with all the other guests like Mary Jane E. When was the last time this place was inspected? This new room was decent besides the fact that someone was drilling (which the even more clueless desk clerk said there was no authorized construction anywhere near my room) and the screaming from the people riding the zip line. This was all topped off with the fact that I only came to this hotel to see Penn and Teller to be told that there were absolutely no tickets available for the duration of my stay and there are no amenities for hotel guests get first dibs on the tix. Speaking of shows, we went to see Zarkana which was at the Aria and the shuttle system Rio has is dumb. It is 2 buses that either drop you off at Harrah's or Bally's which are within walking distance of each other. Somewhere further down the strip like Aria or Excalibur would've been way better. This all came to a head when near the end of my stay I had been comped $50 for the hot water fiasco and then they tell me I had to pay for the stuff I had bought using that $50! I wasn't having it and made them check the supposed ""notes"" one of the other clueless clerks put in with my room or whatever outdated technology they use because this clerk that was trying to charge me tried to get all nasty with me by cleaning off her garbage from the computer monitor and then turning it around to try to show me I still owed them.

We usually go play some craps, hit the slots (getting as many free drinks as we can intake, well not really free because we tip nicely) and then hit the clubs (somewhere else).

Location: It's off the strip, but the shuttle comes every 15 minutes, so not a big deal.  Plus its close to the Palms, where we like to party.

Atmosphere: It's nice to sit around, get some drinks and have a live show perform for you.  We will mess around with the slots, drink a tad and watch the singing\/dancing show in the sky.

Food: Best buffet in Vegas!!!  The cafe is also good and has great service.

Price:  Awesome.  Great price for the size of the room.  Buffet is expensive, but it's worth it. 

Value Tip:  Get a players card and you can receive points for future comps.  Gamble, Gamble,Gamble and you will love your stay!

I booked a standard room for my husband, young daughter and mother to stay in.  We arrived at the desk a little after 3:00 p.m. and the line was quite long.  It took us about 25 minutes to check in.  Our room was on the 16th floor of the Ipanema tower.  The rooms were large, but nothing fancy which was expected as our room was comped.  We had a mini fridge and it felt too warm to keep perishables in.  It was a bit of a hassle because they are not self-adjusting and we had to wait for maintenance to come and lower the temperature to keep my mom's medicine cold.  The room appeared clean, but on the last day (thankfully) I did notice a huge pile of dirt and grime in the corner of the bathroom.

The pool area was great!  One pool has sand around making it appear like a beach.  They have waterfalls which were a hit with our daughter.  The middle pool is just a standard pool and the third pool is like the first without the sand.  The pools are all shallow with the deepest being like 4 feet or so.  The only problem we had was that the pool area closes at 7 p.m. which is rather early in Vegas standards.  It makes it difficult to spend the day on the strip and come back for an afternoon swim.  The sandy pool closed at 6 p.m. and they turned the waterfalls off at 6 p.m. on the other pool too.  It does open at 9 a.m. so you could always do the pool first and then explore the strip in the afternoon as it is definitely hot enough to swim at 9 a.m. in Vegas (in July at least).  

I would suggest renting a car as the Rio is quite far from the strip.  They do offer a shuttle service that runs to Bally's and back.  The first time we walked by, it was full and people were standing and waiting.  The second time there wasn't as many people, so it's hit or miss on the shuttle crowds.  If you are renting a car and staying in the Ipanema tower, make sure to park in the smaller parking garage (3-story) as it is much closer to the rooms.

If you want a club in your hotel that has a bomb DJ, this is NOT the place for you. The DJ really was certifiably awful, cutting things up too soon and in places and with other songs that just did not work. There were literally dead silent moments between songs. Wat? The bartender was nice, though. That Witch Doctor drink is NOTHING to play with lol split it with 3-4 people of you want to see straight by the end of the night.

About the poker room here.  It's a small room that was renovated a year or two ago, clean and well run.  The WSOP in the Rio convention center obviously overshadows it, but there is some good spillover into the cash games here late at night.  There were about ten full tables of no limit (1\/3 and 2\/5) going at midnight.  Not as much drinking going on as I would have liked.  

Here is a hand I played last night, sorry that this is a bit long, it's from a report I did for a poker site I post at, but it may give other players some idea of the action to be had here when the wsop is in town:

The 2\/5 no limit was a very tight aggressive table with a lot of tough players. Average stack was about $1000 with two guys well above that. I sat down with $500 and limped in to a few hands, not hitting much, mostly just observing these guys. I picked up 9d8d on the button and limped in for $20 with 3 other players. The flop was 10d8c8s, which I very much liked. The first player to act thought he'd take down the pot nice and quick with a $40 bet. 

As I was thinking of how much to raise him the player immediately to my right, the big stack at the table raised it to $80. That surprised me. I honestly had no idea what to think about that. He had a lot of chips so it was very possible he was making a move. After due consideration I called his bet with the hope of improvement in my hand in the form of a runner runner flush draw or straight possibilities. 

The initial raiser mucked quickly and the turn was the Q of h. Big Stack looks at it for a lil bit and bets $200. It didn't take him very long to bet. 

A problem I had with this hand is I hadn't been at the table very long and didn't know enough about how these guys played. I should not have gotten involved in a big hand this early, since it was possible this guy only bet monsters. But as the big stack I assumed he was pushing people around a lot, and I was not going to call away half my stack at this point, and I did have the inside straight draw. So I went all in for $400 on top of his bet. 

Obviously at this point I was also hoping that my trips were good. 

They were not. He called and flipped over Jx8x for the better kicker. I had ignored all of the signs that this guy was very strong and followed my trips into quite the trap. I knew he was strong but could not lay down my hand. The river was the lovely Ace of Spades and so the kicker issue became irrelevant and we split the pot. 

I am including this in this thread which started with me whining about flopping a big straight and being run down by a lucky caller, to show that luck can come full circle I suppose. Nice to be the one sucking out on this one. 

Last comment, now that I think about it, the thing that really bothered me about Big Stack betting big was there was no flush or straight draw for him to be betting, and he seemed like the type of player that would do that. Which led me to think he had the other 8. And a better kicker. Which he did. And I called anyway like a fish, lol. And then got lucky.  Ah poker.",5,3,3

I called the front desk and asked to be moved and was asked why? There were several reasons, tile was missing from the floor in the bathroom (actual chunk of tile missing), the safe didn't work, the front door lock (the security one you can flip closed) didn't lock, the wallpaper in the bathroom was gross and faded from water splatter (maybe wallpaper doesn't belong in a bathroom if you can't upkeep it!), the shade for the lamp was all wonky because it had been bent back into place instead of just replaced, the shower barely put out enough water to get the soap out of my hair, and there was a weird spot (blood?) on the ceiling above the bed. All in all, it was like a cheap motel 6. Sure we could have ""upgraded"" to the samba rooms that just were remodeled for extra $$ per night. The rooms we stayed in were not the older rooms, they were the rooms that have been redone in the last few years but obviously not up kept. 

The hotel did move us rooms, but still had issues, The security lock on the door still didn't work. Also, we were there for a conference and apparently the boilers they have for hot water are insufficient because good luck getting a warm (let alone hot) shower during normal shower times because it won't happen.

Got a groupon deal but when we arrived, were told by both parties that we did not have a room booked. Neither parties wanted to admit to a wrong doing but instead pointed blame at each other.

The older man at the desk did not seem to care or try to help to make things a little more comfortable for us even after all of the mishap. (We had to wait there for over half an hour to clear things up and this was after a very long flight). Upon arriving the casino was not the prettiest it was definitely outdated but it was our first time in Las Vegas so did not plan as well as we should have. The rooms were clean but we had a lot of basic things in our rooms that were missing and we had to flag down room service to provide for us (plastic cups, do not disturb sign, no coffee machines and I felt we did not have enough towels). Another thing to note, although I guess casinos are notorious for it, we requested a no smoking room but it smelled like we were smoking every night. (Our neighbor was a chain smoker and all of the smoke was going into our room). Not a happy customer, we did not gamble there and instead went to another on the strip. Will not return to Rio.

I don't care how low my budget is at that time, I will never stay at the Rio again. First things first, as you already know, it is not on the strip. It's on the other side of the freeway between Caesar's Palace and the Bellagio on Flamingo Street. They used to have a shuttle that took you to the strip and back but they recently eliminated it. So unless you plan on making one trip to the strip, walking everywhere you need to go and making another trip back at night, I would highly recommend getting a rental car if staying here. Those Uber\/Lyft rides will add up (mine were $7-$8 per ride). 

Next, the site says that the rooms are updated and renovated. Well, not all of them. My parents had a strip view in the iPanema tower and the room was updated. I'll admit it has a nice view. We had a mountain view in the same tower and our room was very dated. I'll let the pictures speak for themselves. The hotel itself is clean but the hallways smelled like a hospital to me. Also, the elevators are possessed. They stop at random floors and the doors became stuck when opening twice while we were there. The staff was nice and friendly. WARNING: Unfortunately this hotel does have the annoying and pushy timeshare people that ask you if you want show tickets and what day you are leaving every single time they see you. 

Next, with the exception of three places (Smashburger, Sports Deli and the Chinese place next to it), the food here sucks! The buffets are terrible and way overpriced and Hash House a Go Go is a complete joke.

Much to my relief, Rio turned-out to be a wonderful place to sleep, play and watch a great show. My room, although somewhat dated, was very spacious, clean, comfortable...and the water pressure in the shower was just fine for a hotel that is required to follow stringent local regulations. I didn't smell cigarettes or any other offensive odors, and never a bug. The only loud noises I heard was the train going by a couple times a day. The room itself was great, the view wonderful. The only real complaint was housekeeping never made-up my room during my 2-day stay...but probably my fault...I stayed in bed until early afternoon after a long night of partying and gambling, and I never requested a cleaning.

I think many on Yelp either expect way too much from a lower cost hotel, or just love to pick their nits. Or maybe there's another Rio Hotel Casino in Las Vegas. The one I stayed at met or exceeded my expectations for the price I paid. This isn't Caesar's people...and none of you spent dearly to stay here.

Everyone on the staff I encountered, from the check-in desk, the casino staff, the servers in the restaurants, the security, to the bell desk at the end of my stay proved to be polite, friendly and efficient. No one was ever surly or rude. Not one in the bunch.

The Penn and Teller Show was simply wonderful, and was even upgraded in seat selection because I went early and asked. But will review their show separately. 

The only slight disappointment was the Hash House a Go Go, but not enough to not recommend. Will review separately.

The Rio Carnival Buffet, which was indeed huge and spectacular, seemed slightly overpriced given the Rio's location in Vegas, especially since the Gold Coast Buffet next door is half the price. I won't bother with reviewing this buffet as it's buffet food, and not much more. You get what you pay for.

The pool had very restrictive hours, 9am to 6pm, and it never fit my lifestyle. I like to enjoy an early morning swim, around 6 or 7, OR a swim in the evening. I'm not a sun worshiper, and have no use for pools in the daytime. Although the pools were plentiful and beautiful, being closed when I needed them made them worthless.

The lobby and casino DID smell of tobacco, more than other casino's I visited in Vegas, but by the nit-picky reviews of others, I was expecting to cut thru a fog of cigarette smoke. I never encountered that experience, and my clothes didn't smell of smoke at the end of the night. Lower priced hotels seem to attract a higher volume of smokers by sheer demographics. Wasn't too bad, but longed to return to smoke-free California.

The Voodoo Lounge on the roof was another disappointment, and will review separately, but just to say that the only thing to buy a ticket for is the view. The club itself was horrible. Thank God I came on a free night.

The shops were okay, but overpriced for the Rio's location. They needed a discount gift store, and I would have spent more. Spent my dough at the better priced Gold Coast hotel next door.

Won't complain about the Casino, as you place your bets and takes your chances, but very stingy slots. Beware.

The resort fee was steep for the lack of a resort. I couldn't use the pool, and I don't go to spas. The WIFI was indeed slow, but much better than dial-up. Some reviewers are funny, expecting lightening fast speed in a massive hotel complex.

Not sure what the Rio's true market is...it desperately wants to be a luxury strip hotel, but also wants to be known for value. I used the free shuttle to Bally's a lot. Overall, if you're on a budget, or just want to spend your money on other things than lodging, the Rio Hotel Casino is a great place to stay. Don't expect the Bellagio, and you won't be disappointed. Keep expectations limited to the price you're paying, and you'll be rewarded with a wonderful stay. I highly recommend the Rio.",11,2,3

First off i noticed several long hairs on our bed, so I pulled back the covers to check the sheets where I found even more smaller hairs in the bed...nasty!  We called housekeeping and someone came up to remake the bed. We then found that the safe in our room didn't work, our shower was broken, and the door to the hotel room had issues closing properly. The repair man told us that some of the doors have closing issues due to their age and he couldn't fix the problem. After having the safe and shower repaired we were given a $40 credit toward food in the hotel. FYI - the Rio Carnival Buffet is not worth eating at even when it's free!

Upgraded to a double masquerade suite. Decent view. Yes strip view, but kind of a side view. Old dingy room. One light didn't work at all. No robes nor tv remote. They don't even give you free coffee anymore. What?!  Yea $8 from the mini bar. Didn't buy that either. We were on the 28th floor and could hear the music from the pool all day and then the club at night. Was a joy from 2am til 9am with no noise or thump thumping. 

With that being said...the room was quite spacious. Three of us and I didn't feel cramped. The bed was hard and the pillows even worse. There is a small window that looks from the bathroom into the bedroom. They need to offer some blinds with that or some way to cover it. We just used our soap and shampoo bottles.

I called to see what this additional charge was and they said they had billed me for a damaged mattress. 
I disputed this claim and they sent me a picture of an obviously old Urine stained mattress.  Apparently the maids had not checked the mattress protector sheets in some time.  I am insulted and disgusted that we had slept on this soiled mattress and then were accused of urinating in the bed.  This stain is old and brown around the edges.  You can tell it was aged.

I booked a room through a representative for the hotel who quoted me for a certain rate and then sent me an email. Upon arrival I provided them with the email and checked in. Check in was fine and easy. Rio has a lot of really good things about it. 

We loved the club on the top of the building. Would defiantly go there again.

We loved the sports club\/ food area. It was actually some of the best drunken pizza I have had. We went there almost everyday. They have some great quality food for a reasonable price. 

The hotel room was nice, had a decent bathroom, could have used a newer tv, had a mini fridge in the room already which was a nice touch. Was clean and tidy. 

The casino was nice. Not to big not to small didn't win anything but hey that's for another review. 

The hotel buses to the strip were okay. They need to schedule more buses during rush hours times and pay their bus drivers more because they deal with a lot of stuff and angry people since they were waiting for an extra 30 minutes in 100 degree heat. 

Upon check out we went to go pay our bill and to my surprise was was charged over by $100.00. I informed the clerk and showed her the reciept\/email to which she admitted that they had made the mistake by not putting in the original price upon check in. So I proceeded to wait for over 50 minutes and do the math for the clerk trying to get the bill corrected. I informed her that because of their mistake we now missed breakfast, which they tried to give us meal comps but it would have to be a discount on my card that was attached to my room, with the recent mistakes in transaction I wished for no more and turned it down. In the end they informed me that the money would be returned to my card within 2 weeks. Well 2 months later I am still waiting and with over 3 phone calls still nothing. So I have given up.

The two biggest negatives with the hotel experience were the wait to check in which took about 10-15 minutes. I'm very impatient. The second negative was the amount of time it took to get out of the hotel on Sunday because all of the elevators were full with everyone leaving at the same time. They also decided to paint the walls near one of the elevators banks in the middle of the day on Saturday which I thought was an odd time to do repair work. This caused a line to ride the elevators.

To my surprise, though, I did not hear a thing. The bed was incredibly uncomfortable for both my husband and I. I thought it was just me, but my husband confirmed it the very first morning. It felt like the mattresses were due for a change out. 

The pool was my favorite part of the hotel. We spent half of our full day at the pool(we were there on a weekend trip) each pool had its own waterfall and we made it just in time to get good spots to rest and sun bathe. The snack bar was good food. They also had Poolside Massage service which I took advantage of. They charged $2 a minute and are willing to cater to what your needs are. It was fantastic. 

The food choices are great. We have eaten at the World Buffet and we also tried the Pho and Deli locations. If you get the chance go to the Pho location and get the egg rolls. A bit pricey but so so good!

- The Seafood Buffet is a seafood overload and more. (Dear Lord, please let my stomach be bigger than my eyes. Amen.) LOL I tried to eat everything but it's virtually impossible. Mmm...lobster, scallops, shrimp, king crab legs, stone crab claws (which are a bitch to crack open), pasta with seafood, fish (of all kinds), prime rib (they do have other things besides just seafood. lol), etc. 
- Carnaval World Buffet is still yummy til this day. There's something for everyone. There are somethings that are hit and miss but there's so much to try to sample. Again, I wish my stomach was bigger than my eyes. HAHAHA 

Not that I don't appreciate the buffets, but I wish they had a food court or something. Sometimes you just want a really quick bite with a smaller price. It's cuz we can't all be millionaires.

After being scolded for pulling into the wrong valet lane so I could unload my suitcase and check in (I should have been in the common folk lane, not the super duper multi-star lane), I checked in for a two night stay.  Finally got checked in and headed to my room.  The bathroom area has a nice seated vanity area, but THERE WAS NO MIRROR over it.  Clearly there should have been because you could see the spots on the wall where there used to be adhesive.  Got past that.  Was happy to see that there was a Keurig coffee maker on the counter near the vanity.

The next morning I got up and went to make a cup of coffee.  Realized there was no coffee nor coffee condiments on the counter.  I called housekeeping and they advised that there IS coffee, but it is part of the honor bar and there is a charge if you use.  Are you kidding me?!  Another ""amenity"" that they want to nickel-and-dime-you-to-death with.  

Once ready to head out I decided to leave the ""do not disturb"" on the door as I didn't feel like securing all my valuables and computer.  Come back after a long day, slip off my shoes and am getting comfortable.  Head into the restroom area and catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror over the vanity.  Wait a minute - there WAS no mirror over the vanity this morning!  Apparently the housekeeping and engineering staff decided to completely disregard my ""DO NOT DISTURB"" on the door and help themselves to my room, while all my personal belongings, valuables and electronics were out in the open!  I felt violated, unsafe and totally pissed off.  When I called the front desk to complain, they asked if I'd like someone from housekeeping to contact me.  Why?  Why would I want that?!  The customer relations person I spoke to were less than sympathetic nor concerned.   I slept uneasy that night, and vowed I will never step foot into that place again.  I didn't find anything missing but that is besides the point.  They had no right in my room when I asked for privacy.

And the icing on the cake of the mirror suddenly appearing in my room was that they didn't even bother to clean it after they installed it!  There were smudges and hand prints all over it.  Nice.

So if you decide to stay here - make sure you lock up your stuff even if you have the ""Do Not Disturb"" placquard showing.  Because they do not respect your rights or privacy.",2,0,0

The hotel is not very near the Strip and separated by the Interstate.
It is very inconvenient to get to the strip from the Rio.
The casino was extremely noisy as there was constant loud music blaring throughout.  The exhaust to handle the smoke was not sufficient either.
There is NO way to get from your room to leave the hotel without going through the casino and all the smoke and noise.  The check in process was quite long as were the lines.

Typically we like to stay at the Wynn or the Trump Towers.  Anyway we checked into a non-smoking room that had a king size bed.  

The good news:The view was decent.  It wasn't a strip view but we could see the Palms casino from where we were.  The room was very spacious.  It had a desk area and a living room area with a couch & coffee table.  There was a mini-fridge, the windows were nice and large ( wall to wall), the tv had a swivel pull out shelf, there's 2 sinks in the bathroom area.  One sink is in the vanity area and the other in the actual bathroom.  

The bad news:  The walls are paper thin! I could hear every conversation happening in either of the neighboring rooms.  The carpet had some fruit punch looking stains.  The drapes didn't completely cover the windows so in the morning when the sun started to come up a sliver of light would shine through, but it was bright enough to wake us up.  The vanity area was nice a spacious, but the tub is TINY!  The door could practically hit the toilette it was so small in there.  It was also out dated.  The bed was also the most uncomfortable bed we've ever slept on.  The springs practically came shooting out of the matress and left marks on our backs.  The pillows were also very uncomfortable.  The check in lines were insanely long.  There were about 4 out of 8 stations with employees checking people in.  We also tried the famous ""world buffet"" that they have there.  There is a wide selection, but the quality is so-so and you're lucky if the servers remember you exist! It was almost impossible to get a refill on our drinks.

I stay here no less than twice a year and right up front will tell you I love this place. Now to explain why. First of all staying off strip just one block from Caesars is a blessing. Fighting the mass of cars and people to get to the hotel vs the Rio is day and night. Check in for players card holders is a breeze. If you get a car you don't have to self park and walk miles to check in. Valet is free and right at the front door by check in . Bell hop is free also. So no reason to self park and hike with bags. The rooms are mega large. I would say about 30' x 30' or between 700 and 909 square feet. I hate checking into a hotel were you have to turn sideways to get into the room and nowhere to put bags or hang clothing. At Rio all rooms are big. Large closets with safes ironing boards irons and plenty of hangers. The bathrooms are large with an external bath room sink and internal  bath room sink. Plenty of drawers for stuff. Large bed or two beds, sofa, chair , desk, tv cabinet with flat screen, refrigerator . 2 night stands and chest by closet.?They did take the cureig coffee pots out but I bring my own anyway. Some rooms have a table. Room service is great as well as maid and bell service. Yes the furniture might be older but the room is clean and I come to Vegas to experience Vegas and not sit in the furniture. The casino is as good as the others on the strip and offers similar gaming. The Rio does have shows by the way. Penn and Teller one of the top shows in Vegas. Chippendales, XRocks, comedy show and soon rock of ages. Many places to eat (check the rio web site) but the Buffett is still really good and one of the largest in Vegas . Hash house is great also., bartenders are great and freely flow the free drinks. That is if your gaming and not trying to sit around trying to  milk free drinks . Voo Doo lounge is fun and the witch doctor drink with sneak up on you. Shops are average but Counts tattoos is there . Same guy that has the tv show counts Kustoms . Pool area is cool and there is an audit area. Free shuttles every 30 minutes to Ballys and Harrahs. So getting to and from the strip is easy . Also walking distant to Palms and Gold Coast. So the place is fine and you will enjoy it.,",1,0,0

It's a favorite for locals and frequent travels like me. Rooms are big almost 600 square feet and most have great views. In my opinion has one of the best pool areas in Vegas with four pools ranging from family to the adult pool. They have the best buffets in Vegas hands down for price , service and taste. Not a big fan of there All American Grille , steaks looked good nice and aged but so expensive for the type of restaurant it is. They have 2 Starbucks in the casino and a yogurt bar. Penn & Teller play here and is worth every penny. Customer service needs a little work but so does most of Vegas. There Valet guys are some of the best and they have self parking and Valet parking garage. I haven't tried the Voodoo steakhouse ( next trip) but suppose to have the best views of  all the Vegas Restaurants. 

  The bottom line is the Rio is one of the best deals in all of Vegas. From it's location to it's affordable rooms and great  buffets. If your looking to stay in Vegas but cant afford the strip but want to be near the strip then the Rio is for you. I stay here every year for the last 4 years and  the customer service is my biggest complaint and it's ramp-id in all of Vegas not just the Rio. I suggest getting a Total Rewards card it gets you discounts on rooms and food and drink and is good at all there sister resorts ( Cesar's, Paris, Harrahs, Flamingo, Imperial Palace, Rio, many more  ) .Good luck in your search and hope to see you at the Rio next time.",5,0,0

All in all it was a really nice hotel.  Even though it is off the strip, there is a shuttle (as many mention) that takes you back and forth to Paris\/Bally's and Harrahs.  As everyone has noted, the rooms are HUGE.  The sofa was plenty comfy.  They had a lot of coupons in their booklet that helped bring the cost down for us on things like super fancy meal at the Seafood restaurant and for the show.  

I wanted to like the pool area, but unfortunately when we went to go swimming at 3 on a Sunday, they had closed the whole area to get ready for a concert in the evening. What?!  That was very disappointing as I had been dreaming all day about going swimming in the pool.  When they did reopen the area at 4:30ish (to let the concert goers in) the concert was free, so we got to go in and swim, but then it was just weird because it was mostly full of people there for the concert, so we didn't stay long.

 The dealers we experienced were for the most part really nice and helpful.  There was only one I had a negative experience with and luckily her boss was right there when she made the mistake so I didn't have to argue with her.  We had a very helpful roulette dealer in the early afternoon who showed my sister the ins and outs of betting which she appreciated since she had never done it before.  

I found the beds to be off-puttingly firm, so I didn't like that.  They also had (at least in our room) a weird window in the shower that looked into the room so when you were in there showering I felt a little exposed (It was only my shoulders up but I'm at 5'7""  Any taller and you maybe exposing more).  That meant, too, that if you turned on the light in the bathroom in the middle of the night, there was a flash of light in the room too.

I booked my stay through hotels.com and got a super cheap rate for my birthday. I usually travel to see friends but because of medical expenses I couldn't. So a deal to spend some time away was nice. The site was up front about the $28 resort fee so I was expecting that. What I wasn't expecting was the hold of $200 for room service!!! If I had that I wouldn't have been booking a hotel for less than $30 a night in the first place!!! The directions to the tower elevators were unclear, I ended up getting lost and having a cardiac episode (I have a heart condition where my arteries spasm) I couldn't find anyone on the casino floor to help me.

It kept me up all night the first night. I can feel it vibrate the wall the bed is on. The shower ceiling is peeling. The view of the zipline is pretty cool though.

The rooms here were huge and we got connecting rooms which was a big plus....and they were no-smoking rooms...what a difference.

Checked in Sunday and found myself stuck in line because there was a big convention (and didn't realize that nursing convention visitors could be so rude).  I stood in line for an hour to get my keys.  I will mention the front deskman (Ricky for CA) was suuuper nice and warned us that our room would have some noise overhead from the pool.  No biggie to me.

After waiting a long time to get our luggage from the bell desk (that includes being on hold for 20 minutes AND THEN waiting for the luggage to come up), we went to the pool to catch some rays.  Poor is nice...not amazing...but this is a Rio so I can't complain..  HOWEVER, I can complain about the state of our room.  The faucets were clogged with what was likely vomit.  We called housekeeping\/maintenance (was on hold for 40 minutes before we hung up and called back) and waited again for the maintenance guy to come up.  The sinks in this hotel tend to have this clogging problem per the maintenance guy...and he was spending all day unclogging sinks.  He was also by himself and and this was a 2 person job.  My bf kindly stepped in to help him hold part of the sink so he could attempt to unclog it.  Kind of gross- my bf got sprayed by whatever was in the sink in the process.  After that happened, the maintenance guy called down to the front to ask if we could be moved and ""they"" said ""no"" [because they were so behind with the convention].  The maintenance guy left and came back with some other tools but in the end he was unable to fix the sink without ""causing a big mess"".  We were finally moved to another room- an upgrade!!! i.e. a bigger suite.

Boy were we STILL in for a surprise.  The room wasn't that bad...until you noticed the small things.  Wallpaper peeling...dirty showers...etc.  And in addition, the hallways smelled like an illegal substance which kept seeping into our room.  To each his own, but I'm not in college anymore and I don't need to have everything smell like pot.

The people that work here are really nice but the management is selfish and\/or probably overworked like everyone else.  I didn't need a suite upgrade- it's not something I feel like I'm entitled to (I would have rather had the stupid resort fee waived or a free dinner if I had to choose).  However, I do expect decent service and decent rooms.  We ALMOST went home early but decided to stick it up.  I'm so annoyed though I am NEVER STAYING HERE AGAIN!!!",5,2,1

check in was a breeze! diamond and platinum check in was super fast, but the registration desk is pretty far from the MT parking. you have to almost walk to the other side of the hotel through the casino just to get there. 
got to the room..27th floor regular suite. very spacious! only bad part was the bathroom. the shower SUCKED! it was dirty and the water was spraying everywhere else but on me! also no vent in the shower..which didnt really bother me much, but the boyfriend didnt like that. there is also a window in the wall where you can see into the bathroom from the bedroom! its kinda weird..but whatever. there was only 2 of us. if youre staying with a big group and dont want anyone looking into the shower while you're in it, i would recommend getting a place somewhere else. lol. 
also another bad thing: after clubbing and gambling all night long, all we want to do at 5 in the morning is go to our room and sleep. but no...they wouldnt let us up because they were having elevator problems and they said people were stuck! there were all kinds of people there like security guards, hotel management, and firefighters keeping us from going up. then when there was a big enough group of people wanting to go up, they decide to take us through the back way into a service elevator which would be able to take us up. WRONG! we filed into the elevator, about 10-15 of us, doors closed, and up we go. or not! we got stuck in the elevator for a good 15-20 mins! i swear i was going to suffocate or pass out! it was soo stuffy in there, this group of drunkards eating spicy chicken wings wouldnt shut up and the fumes of their wings were going everywhere and making everything THAT much more hotter! the drunk girls are telling the security guard to open the door. umm..im pretty sure he would if he could. anyways, some of the guys finally were able to pull the doors open!

Black Jack tables were ok limits were pretty high for the odds and some decent craps tables. Rooms were ok at the Samba tower. One plus was spa access was open with the resort fee. One minus was the steam room was closed for repair and jet in hot tub the same. I almost got the feeling they were closed for good or for staff convenience.

There were a lot of little things like lack of organization and maintenance issues that should've been caught before check in which added up to make this a disappointing stay. I was in the Masquerade tower.

Very first impression was not good.  Immediately walking into the hotel to check in was chaos. There was a huge crowd around the self check\/early check in kiosk and there looked to be no line for the kiosk.  Since I had already early checked in via my email all I needed to do was pick up my room key. I saw to the left of this unorganized crowd at the kiosk were registration desk and no line, so I walked up to the desk and the lady asks me did I come from the line? I asked what line? I was then informed that behind the chaotic crowd there was a line for regular check in, which was crazy long (est an hour+ to get through).  You couldn't see this line because of the crowd, I asked if there was a line for the kiosk and she said they were first come first served.  I told her I already early checked in via email.  She then says well there is another line for key pickup which was past the regular check in line lol.  Talk about very unorganized and the early check in line only had one person working which made the early check in line go just as slow as the regular check in!

The room overall was nice, very spacious.  The hot water however was not working for the first 3 days I was there. The sinks only ran cold water and the tub eventually ran hot water but you had to let the water run for at least 20 minutes.  I literally let the water run, then took a full shower before the hot water kicked in!  I called the front desk to report the hot water was not working to which I was told I need to let the water warm up first (obviously). When I told them about taking a full shower and the water never warming up they said they would look into it.  The next day I called to follow up and I was told the water boiler was down.

The sinks were clogged and needed to be snaked.  Whenever we would run the water in the sink and turned it off, after a few seconds you could hear the water in the sink draining making a loud *glug glug* noise for the next few minutes.  Being familiar with clogged drains I knew they pipes must've been full of past guest hair over the weeks, months, or years however often they decided to clean them.  I again called the front desk to inform them of this nuisance. They said they would send someone to check it out but the noise remained for our entire stay! 

I believe in letting someone know when something isn't working properly so they can correct the problem.  If no one ever tells them then how would they know there's a problem.  They never corrected the problem so this didn't sit well with me.

Another thing we noticed was there was a plastic bag taped around the smoke detector.  So I called the front desk to ask why.  The guy said he had no idea and that it needed to be removed right away and he would send maintenance right up.  This was around 10pm, I was in town for a conference and needed to get some sleep.  After 45 minutes of no one showing up I called back because I was about to go to sleep and didn't want them showing up while I was sleep.  I told the next person I spoke with I was going to bed so when is maintenance showing up? She said well they come in the order of the ticket and she could cancel until morning if I'd like.  I asked her if the hotel thought that it was acceptable to leave a plastic bag over a smoke detector? She put me on hold to find out lol.  Turns out there was a marijuana convention in Vegas the prior week and they put bags over all the smoke detectors but clearly forgot to remove them once it was over.

These are the small things that never should've happened.  Maintenance should've had plastic bags removed from smoke detectors, they should have sinks not clogged, and hot water should never be out for more than 3 days and I not be offered anything for my inconvenience.  If I pay for a hotel, I'm paying for hot water and hot showers as well.

On a good note, the cleaning staff kept our room clean everyday.  Never had an issue with the room being cleaned throughout our stay.

I doubt I'll be staying here again.",0,1,0

The worst part is that we could not get any sleep until after 2 am due to the music ( or I should say the same beat repeating over and over) from the Voodoo lounge filling our room and shaking our walls.  
We called the front desk to change rooms and were told that no rooms were available.  The manager was supposed to call us which never happened.

Well sorry, mom but this needs to be said. WORST HOTEL in the Caesars Group!!! Let's break down this ZERO STAR review piece by piece:

The rooms: When's the last time these rooms have been cleaned? I've seen crack dens in better condition. If you're someone who cares about germs, don't worry, you won't need a blacklight because at this hotel the stains are clearly visible all over the place. Make sure to stay up to date on your shots. And that smell? Oh don't worry, that's just your friendly Chinese neighbors making a restaurant's amount of food in the room next to you. But don't worry, they're quieter than the mice that are surely running around.

Also, be concerned about the security deposit you have to pay upfront because the room begins in shambles from the moment you check in and only seems to deteriorate worse as your stay goes along.

The parking: Hahahaha good luck finding decent parking at this place. Also, watch for thieves. Last time I stayed there, I had parts stripped off of my car...which brings me to my next point

Security: LMAO yeah right! When I told them I had parts stripped off my car while it was parked in THEIR garage they said there's nothing they could do about it. What are they even there for then?! Oh yeah that's right...they're barely there to begin with. You'll probably only find them at the security desk when the line for Starbucks gets too long.

The food: You're paying out the nose to have your colon explode. You'll also learn that explosive diarrhea and projectile vomiting are VERY REAL.

The help: Some help they are. Try asking anyone in this place to help you with anything. It's more entertaining than Penn & Teller. 

I honestly don't know how this place belongs under the Caesars Entertainment umbrella...they should just have this place condemned.",2,3,0

I was originally staying at the LVH and didn't really like it that much. It was okay, but nothing impressed me. Everything in the building is sort of old and falling apart for the once glorious Hilton. The rooms are TINY and very run down. So I decided to book another hotel when I found out I have to stay 2 more nights in Vegas. After reading some reviews, I booked Rio. It's actually a lot better that I expected, especially for the price I'm paying. My parents are very Chinese and are not use to American food. Rio is very Chinese friendly hotel and is close to Chinatown, there's also 4 Chinese TV channels (2 Cantonese, 1 mainland and 1 Taiwan.) The rooms are way better than LVH (also no resort fee.) It was very big, there's 2 beds and a sofa with ceiling to floor windows. The bathroom is very clean and pretty as well. The only downside is that's it's not really on the strip and there's no way to walk there, BUT there's a free shuttle to the strip from 10am to 1am every half an hour to the Harris and Bally's.

I said I need to be compensated for having to sleep in this ashtray, so he said he would waive the hotel fee! A whopping 30bucks. 

I then said that in that case, you need to send someone up to change the bedding pillows and all, you need to change the filter in the av unit, and you need to spray some free breeze on everything. They did all if that and it still looks like a pig with lipstick. 

We'll see tomorrow if I can get my downgrade back!! RIO so far you Suck!!

Show up at 10 min after 4 pm and you already have 35+ people ahead of you.  If you booked through any online travel agencies like Hotels.com or Expedia you need to make sure whoever is checking in (spouse, etc.) is on the reservation confirmation.  Otherwise you would have stood in line for nothing.  They have a strict policy about not letting you check in even if you can show that you and the other person are listed under the same profile.  The hotel is off the strip and situated in a commercial area- lots of dilapidated warehouses and depressed residential area.  Free shuttle to strip comes every 30 min.  Show In The Sky is in the Masquerade Tower and runs between 6 pm and 11 pm on the hour every hour- it's free and they give out colorful beads.  Free passes to Voodoo Lounge before 10 pm is available at the front desk- there are breathtaking views from the hotel rooftop.

There has been NO follow up from management when I was a guest at this hotel for 4 days, 3 nights.  NO resolving the issue.

Here's why: 

Although the Rat Pack Is Back was enjoyable, the show was ONLY an hour an 15 minutes and it was NOT disclosed on the Living Social I purchased.  During the show it was interrupted severely over 4 different times by the hotel alarms\/sirens and emergency lights.  Hats off to the entertainers of the show that continued with the show.

The box office said I can repurchase a ticket at buy one - get one.  The option they offered was to watch the show again (RPIB) and or watch the Michael Jackson show (this show I was told by them is SHORTER 1 hr and 15 minutes and I had seen multiple poor reviews). I opted not to do this and requested if I can see another show the RIO offers or transfer the credit to anything else with the hotel. I was DECLINED and while in line at the box office I turned around and asked customers behind me if they would like to use my buy one - get one? I didn't think anything about it and was being nice about the whole thing and the woman that worked the box office YELLED at me in front of the crowd and said you can't do that! This offer is for you and for you only! I was embarrassed and the customers looked in shock that she reacted the way she did.

The cockroaches and cigarette butts marked the path, like bread crumbs from a deranged Hansel and Gretel. 

We got the rooms for a bargain, something like 330 bucks total for four nights. The parking is free, and once you figure out which lot to park in, it's not a long walk. The place reeks of cigarette smoke, my eyes watered within minutes of entering the casino. The Show in the Sky is vulgar and not really good, more camp than sex. We never ate at any of the restaurants. The poker room is sad. But for 330 bucks for four nights, so what! 

Our room was comfortable, obviously old and beaten. Our room had a really weird smell, we never were able to figure out what it was. Sort of muskrat + pine deodorizer + musty air conditioning vent. The thermostat was broken, I figured this out the 3rd night, they fixed it, and we didn't have to wear 2 sets of clothes to bed to stay warm. It was clean, has a fridge, big TV, desk and fold out sofa, along with a king bed. The view was of a roof and the mountains. We had to ask for more towels, as we had no washcloths and only 2 bath towels, but that was given quickly. 

We made a run to Food 4 Less, which is just down the street at Flamingo and Decateur, and bought cups, snacks, drinks, beer. Since there is a fridge in the room, we had breakfast in the room in am, and then had snacks and cold drinks to take with us on day trips. I would only stay at the Rio if you have a car, and the car rental will be as much as taxi rides to other places, so you may as well do the car and have more mobility. I was designated driver, so my boozing was limited, that's the only downside. 

I'd stay here again if it's cheap. I wouldn't pay a lot of money to stay here, it isn't worth it. I can see it being good for kids, it has big rooms, although there isn't much to do for kids, and Circus Circus would be more fun for them.",0,0,0

On Friday (8\/22\/2014) around noon I called the hotel to inform them that we are arriving late and requested for a baby crib to be ready in our room.
The representative was very kind and made the comments promising me that everything will be ready on time.

We arrived at the hotel around 10:30pm and expected to check in and go to sleep.
The check in counter was packed and we had to wait, when finally we were able to check in - we were told that there are no King size beds available and only queen beds rooms are available.
Even though the reservation confirmation said: ""ROOM PREFERENCES
We will make every effort to fulfill your preference requests; however they are not guaranteed, as rooms are assigned at check-in. Additional charges may apply for some requests. For accommodation preferences for the physically challenged, please call us at 1-800-CAESARS.""

I had no choice but to except that - BUT I don't understand, if I'm booking a specific room I should get what I paid for.
Then, I asked for the crib (which was obviously not ready in our room) and I was told I need to pay for it.
***On the phone call that I made earlier no one told me about the rooms not being available nor that I have to pay for the crib!***

I told the guy at the front desk, that if I am not getting the king size beds I should not pay for the crib. Eventually he said that he will not charge me for it.

In addition, he suggested that we will switch to a king size room the day after (Saturday), and to expect a voice mail from the registration desk.
No need to mention that no one called us or contact us in any way and we never got the king size beds.
The first night was quiet and calm.
The second night, 3am a cloud of cigarette smoke took over our room.
A group of young people were partying in the next room. Doors were slamming, people were shouting and cursing all over.
And then - my 17 months old baby woke up coughing! The smoke was so dense as if someone was standing next to our beds and smoking in our faces!
To remind you, we asked for a NON-SMOKING room, which I assume will be placed on a non-smoking floor, or am I wrong?
It is unacceptable to me that my baby will wake up coughing in the middle of the night because the room is full of smoke - after I paid for a non-smoking environment. 
In addition, my parents were in the next room - experiencing that exact smoke experience. My mother just recovered from cancer, and this is a health hazard for her.
I would recommend to change the air filters because when comparing this hotel to others (Cosmopolitan, Bellagio, Cesar's Palace, Wynn, New York New York, and many more) - this is the hotel with the worst cigarette smell in the lobby. 
The only good experiences we had are the pool and the ""House Hash a Go Go"" restaurant.
We are extremely disappointed from this experience, and will make sure to share it with our family, friends, and colleagues.

A friend and I stopped in after the Penn & Teller show. The shopping arcade was all but deserted and at first glance, from across the expanse it wasn't clear if the Lounge was open. Once we approached we could see that it was in fact still open for business. 

We were met at the entrance by a very pleasant elderly gentleman. He hovered nearby as we perused the humidors. I told him I liked Romeo y Julieta's but that I found the store's prices a bit steep. On hearing this he smiled and led me to a shelf displaying several boxes of ""Las Vegas"" brand cigars from $6.99 to $10.99 per stick. He assured me that I would like them and he was absolutely right. For half the cost of a famous brand I found myself savoring a cool, easy drawing smoke while settled into a comfortable club chair. 

I, my buddy and one other cigar aficionado were the only customers in the place for the entire hour and a half as we sat enjoying our stogies while holding forth on a wide range of topics.

I wish I could find this place on Yelp (I even tried online directories to no avail) so that I could single it out for my favorable review. 

Obviously we experienced a tiny sample size and from it can infer little about their overall profitability. But if our experience is even slightly indicative of the traffic they get, I think the place deserves a much higher volume. So, if you're a cigar lover, I invite you stop by and give this place a look. If you like what you find, I hope you'll favor them with your business.",6,1,1

I've stayed here twice this year, and both times my room key stopped working mid-stay.  It was a pain to have to go to the front desk to get a new key, but even worse it took forever and the front desk people were not the most helpful.  They had an attitude and suggested it was my fault cuz the key must have touched my phone or wallet.  Well I stay at many hotels and this is the only place that has happened...TWICE.

My company booked the room for me.  Recently my wallet was stolen from me, and so my drivers license went along with that.  My employer was sure to tell whom ever he booked the room with that this was an issue.  The person told him that it was fine as long as the paper the DMV gave me had my D.O.B. on it, in which it does.  I arrived in Vegas around 2pm and went directly to my employment to establish my job and duties.  I did not arrive to check into my room until around 11pm.  

The staff was quite rude!  The first guy I delt with was not, he just did not have the authority to allow me to check in with out proper ID which contained a photo to prove I am who I am.  The manager did ok my check in, however she told me I am not allowed anywhere on the gambling floor.  Please, I am beautiful, but I do not in any way look under 21yrs of age.  My reply to this was simply, Im not here to gamble, Im here to sleep at that it.  (Mind you, I've been out on that gambling floor!)

Now comes the cleaning staff.  THEY STEAL FROM YOU and when you bring it up to the front desk, they TREAT YOU LIKE POOP!  I raided the mini bar, yes ... yes I did.  I ate a container full of chips, a twix candy bar and ONE can of diet coke.  It was there, it was convenient and so I grabbed it.  The next night, I remembered that there was still one diet coke left so I didn't stop at a gas station to purchase on.  When I got to my room the second diet coke was gone.  I called down to the front desk to inform them that the cleaning crew had jacked a diet coke and I will eat on my dime, I will NOT pay for the cleaning personnel to eat on my dime! The person I spoke with on the phone pretty much told me I was going to be paying for this diet coke because Im the one who drank it.  Im sure they do get this type of situations all the time and thus the poor attitude in handling the situation however some people are honest.  Take a step back and look at how much you pay your employees, the person stole from me.  

This is a round about decent hotel.  It is dated and does show its age, however the floor and entertainment is pretty cool.  They have some rather neat shops inside and thats really all I've had any time to check out.  They do offer WiFi, but you have to pay $13.00 PER DAY for it.  Im staying a week, there is no way  Im going to pay that much per day which makes it hard to perform business.  They should be offering some sort of deal for persons actually on business and not play.  Also, I know that you are allowed to smoke inside of casinos, but it smells so disgusting inside.  Like a stale old dirty bar.  Its gross.

Im so displeased with the way that I have been treated by staff that I can not give the any higher rating that one star.",16,15,12

problem one, the batter of the door key pad died.  Went abck and forth thinking i was the one that de magnitized the card.  After the fourth trip up and down, stated the i thought it might be the door so was told I would be greated by security.  The security gaurd (wish I remember his name but he is from Hawaii and really a very nice gentelman), meet us at our room.  Used he key and said...yup it is the battery so he called down.  I knew it was the batter being that there were no lights when i put my key card in the slot.  The ""lock smith"" showed up 25 minutes later.  So me and my friend had a very nice chat with the security gaurd about how he goes and visits home about once a year, blah blah blah, lol.

the lock smith should have come with the security gaurd...to not have their guest waiting

problem two, i called for a wake up call at 445 am as might flight was at 7 am (stupid i know, but then again, missed all the security lines).  At 330 my friend came back (his flight was at 2 so he was still rocking the vegas night).  He being drunk, woke me up and thus i called to cancel the wake up call and reset one for 1030.  The operated cursed and said the computer was broken\/down and nothing she could do.  I asked they she write it down and that when it was abl eto be done to make ti happen.  she said she ""can not promise"" that being done.  

The greatest part of the weekend were the card dealers and pit bosses.  They scrambled to make everything right.  Boun (sorry if i butchered your name) made my trip so much better.  thank you for make me laugh really hard before my flight left.  until next time. this from the guy with one piece of glitter on his face...

The size of the room was really good, but the space was wasted on small, dated, dingy furniture. What made me give Rio one star was their inhospitable conceirge. They promote shuttles to the airport but when I tried to schedule it I was told I should have accommodated them by giving them more than one day notice and then for them to pick you up, plan on wasting more time waiting for the shuttle, like more than 5 hours ahead of your flight time. This is not because they were concerned about me getting to my flight, but that they had to make their rounds at other hotels. It felt unauthentic as a service and ridiculous that the customer was the one to accommodate THEM. The conceirge staff was bureaucratic and borderline rude.

Our stay was from 10\/27 - 11\/1. We booked two rooms.
1) Our flight came in at midnight. We waited patiently in line to check in for at least 1.5 hrs. Found out that their systems were down, no rooms with 2 queen beds were available. 

2) Gave front desk agent our ID and credit card info in which he wrote it all down to enter into the system when it was up and running again. I booked one room under my name, my father booked the other room 5 months ago online.

3) The room under my name was ready and we got our keys. The room under my dad, since no 2 queens available, they put him in a temporary room and asked that he return Saturday afternoon to switch keys (check out\/check in again). 

4) I got locked out of the room on Saturday. Called security and they said front desk informed that there was no payment on the room. We called, we went to front desk three times to change keys, etc. To no avail. Keys were not working. Security was more compassionate and helpful the second time around and put in a call to maintenance to see if they could change the lock. They witnessed that they keys were not working. However, when Maintenance finally arrived, they only cleaned the lock and told us to just get new keys. When we tried to explain, Maintenance kept telling us that all we could do was to get the keys recoded. 

5) My father's room, he switched to the 2 queens room however for two nights he endured loud music and drunken parties as next door neighbors, finally on the 3rd night he called security to ask if they could quiet the music down. Security came, however it didn't work. The neighbors continued to play their loud music shouting - it's Vegas? what's the problem! 

6) My father gambles at the tables and he talked with the pit boss who told him that he would take care of it and remove the resort fees from our stay as he understood the problems we've endured. He ended up speaking with two pit bosses and a host. They all said they would comp the resort fees from both rooms. However, when we both checked out, the resort fees were still there on my receipt and my father was charged resort fees for 2 out of the 5 nights we were there. 

Lack of resolution, integrity. Actions speak louder than words.

It looked like it was a room fit for 1970 instead of 2016 . The old dirty green carpet and old curtains and lamps were horrible . They also had green curtains over the bed .

1. The room is super dated and nothing like either of the options advertised on The Rio website. The décor is mismatched and worn out. The wall paper in the bathroom, the seams didn't even match up. You could tell that the person who cut it was not paying attention to detail. Super 90's with gold plated fixtures and the floral patterned furniture. The bed is OK but for being a king size they included 4 standard size pillows.
2. The telephone jack was damaged so one phone didn't work
3. 3 lightbulbs were out in the vanity mirror
4. There is obvious signs of damage to tile and furniture. Some of the tile looked cheap and like it was thrown in by an amateur.
5. The shampoo\/soap provided was terrible and dried my skin out even more
6. At check in, we found out that we have to pay another $20 just to be able to get into our room earlier and even then it MAY only be ready
7. The pool area was dirty and the chairs provided were dated and looked unclean
8. The starbucks in the food area was closed at 130pm.
9. The shuttle to Ballys starts at 10am so if you want to get breakfast elsewehere before then you either have to take another form of transportation or walk across the overpass (which we did).
10. The cable on the tv is seriously limited, there is no guide, and there are frequent ""digital"" blocks that show up (like the connection is shoddy).
11. No ventilation in the room, not even in the bathroom which is really weird.

Overall, it was nice to get away from home but I would not stay here nor would I recommend it to anyone else. Too expensive for an average ""motel 6"" type stay.

Pros:
1. The staff is nice.
2. There was a manager, an African American gentleman, short but athletic build that I saw multiple times around the facility and he was very pleasant and I saw him picking up garbage and straightening things out.
3. the room is a large size",0,0,0

The Rio Hotel is off the strip but I like it.  The rooms are large and can accommodate large families.  During one of my visits in the past, we got about 6 rooms and everyone kicked it in our room to pre party before heading out.  Hmmm about 18 people to fit comfortably and chill.  

The hotel itself is on the older side but it is clean.  

I love that there's miniature golf onsite and lots of eatery places.  My favorite is the Chinese Restaurant for Dim Sum.

The FIRST time I came here, I stayed at the Masquerade tower. The AC in the room was the weirdest thing ever. You were either freezing your dick off, or sweating balls. The TV was old and blasted radiation in my eyes. The view was crap. I lost a shit ton of money playing games of the adult variety. 

I said to myself, ""Never again!""

My buddy Alex drags me by the collar and forces me at gunpoint to accompany him to Vegas and stay at the Rio. I said ""Please sir! I'd rather eat a cowchip before I enter that rathole again!""

After consuming said cowchip (maybe I should've told him I just didn't want to go..), we stayed at the Rio for two of the most unpleasant nights I've ever had since turning 21.

The windows were tinted so we could leave the curtains open and enjoy the view during the daytime and nighttime. We also had a large bathroom area with tons of counter space and a shower\/tub combo.

Defcon is an information security conference or ""hacking"" conference, just imagine the shenanigans of concentrating a large number of counter-culture hackers in one spot... yeah so things happened. Sorry Rio, mostly mostly sorry to housekeeping and unrelated hotel visitors. 

Do try and stay in the Ipanema Tower rather than the Masquerade Tower if your left with those choices. Some of the Masquerade Tower rooms look very dated with faulty bathroom fixtures and AC. :(

Great conference area, secluded away from the rest of the hotel there is even an outside area for a smoking patio connect to the parking lot outside. This area makes it easier for transferring boxes and items to the conference. The large panel partitioning areas are convenient and block sound well. The hotel's security is great for the most part but boo for shutting down pool parties earlier than scheduled. 

I'm not usually a big coffee drinker, but attending conferences will make you one. Thank goodness there are two locations for Starbucks, there's one next to the newly installed Hash House A Go Go and a kiosk type one right by Ipanema Towers. Go to the kiosk, shorter line than the main one and runs at all hours, at least during the convention. 

Hash House, really stellar breakfast fare. Happy that they opened one up here, I remember having to cab it to Imperial Palace for Hash House! I suggest the chicken and waffles if you got an appetite.

KJ Dim Sum & Seafood is a legit Chinese place, I got an authentic bowl of Won Ton noodle soup here. Bonus the staff speak Cantonese. 

Pho Da Nang, expensive for Pho I would suggest you go to the nearby Chinatown for a better bowl and better deal. You pay the price for convenience of not leaving the hotel a key to conferences, Pho is a good hangover cure in my book but wow is it over priced.

All-American Bar and Grille, a solid lunch spot I've probably tried every burger on that menu. They even have a decent steak for what it is. 

Shutters Bar- The bar to hang out and chat, not if your parched and need a drink fast. The long bar is staffed by two bartenders and takes a while to get a drink.

iBar- Right in the middle of things, loungy feel welcome your friends as the make it through the hotel's main entrance.

Masquerade Bar- More of a dive bar feel even though though it's inside a hotel, weird I know. Overlook people playing slots or making their way in and out of the Masquerade tower.

Ozone Oxygen Bar- Didn't try this but just made note they added it this year, getting hooked up like someone's grandpa with emphysema isn't appealing.  

Do sign up for the Total Rewards Card, if you plan on dining at the hotel often you can save a buck or two with every meal.

I've enjoyed staying at your hotel every few years for vacation,  eating at the Voodoo Steakhouse and dancing at the Voodoo lounge.  But this past week when I went and it has been a few years, I was highly disappointed with everything that I loved about the Rio.  No Mardi Gras parade in the sky (why not?  Why get rid of something fun and can enjoy with the kids? It's bad enough the ""free shows"" are dwindling as it is).  the room, well, I've never stayed at the Ipanema tower, always the Masquerade tower, but geez, never again.  And then there's the whole Voodoo Lounge issue, which is a big one with me-I don't gamble in Vegas, I go clubbing because it's AWESOME!  Always enjoyed the Voodoo Lounge, inside and out, but now-NEVER AGAIN!!!!  Your greed has totally RUINED IT!  First, all the ""lounging"" can no longer be done, as you have cordoned off all seating booths for those only who order $600 bottle service.  My feet were killing me and I would have liked even a CHAIR to sit down at!  Then, the outside.  The place where I USED to be able to go right to the rail and enjoy the view of the strip.  Nope, now THAT'S cordoned off 10 feet from the edge on all sides with seating for those-AGAIN-ordering $600 bottle service! (by the way, only two groups actually ordered bottle service Saturday night).  So, everyone is basically corraled into a middle section, not the big dancefloor I used to remember, AND there was like, half a dozen pillar\/fire heating units, so not only are you squished that you can't move, let alone dance, but now you're worried IF you move, WILL YOUR HAIR CATCH ON FIRE?!  And with my feet already hurting and I can barely see the strip now, I just left after 20 minutes, not even ordering a drink.

Hubby and I checked in Tuesday ( just turned midnight) and got a killer deal on a super-suite on the 28th floor- much appreciation to Lydia at the registration counter. 1 star.

So much for the killer deal, we entered a beautiful but filthy room. Had it been cleaned before we arrived, I might have just called it a beautiful room. No star.
The compliment only goes for the size of the rooms and some what of a view we've received. We're facing the Palms and the Wyndham hotels. 

There was some sort of sticky substance plastered on the floors, so we called room service and received the upmost worst service possible. Because it was so late, we only asked for the carpets to be vacuumed, the bathroom floors to be mopped and the counter tops to be cleaned, or dusted off at the very least. The room service lady was ethnic and had a strong, either, African or Jamaican accent, so can't blame her if she didn't understand what it was exactly that we were asking but what threw me off was her attitude and customer service. 
I assure you, I work in customer service so when I have it towards me, I try to make it as easy as possible because some customers are just horrid. I, for one, am not horrid. I tried speaking with her and intended to make her job easier by simply telling her what it was that we wanted cleaned with no stuttering, though I did have to repeat myself several times, I just didn't want to give her a hard time. Yet, she made it very clear that she did NOT want to stay and clean. Rather, she was desperate to leave. -I feel a bit offended because I was going out of my way to be so polite- 
She vacuumed the floors for us but told us that the specific area we had called room service for in the first place must be shampooed, it cannot be vacuumed. OK. Then get a shampooing person up here please!? It looked like someone either threw up a bit on the floor or came on it. Ugh.
Tried to get her name but couldn't, will probably get it later. 
Aside from the bed being made, clean floors are the least that could have been done without having to be asked to be done. Room service?: DEFINITELY NO STAR.

Checked out the mini bar- pretty much empty, are they going to charge US for the missing items? NO STAR! Mini fridge is just as empty as when we first arrived, 
on top of that!!!!: while gambling in the masquerade casino, we were falsely accused of stealing a $20 scarf from a boutique called ""Landeau""- great way to garnish more money from your guests Rio! Forced to either pay the $20 or a $500 fee.. I wish it were possible to take ALL stars off!
We've had it!

Upon checking out because of such a horrid ONE NIGHT stay!!!! We asked security to escort us out and called upon a bellhop. 
Security was a sweet young woman who in less than 10 minutes turned into a disgusting rude BITCH! I never call ANYBODY a bitch, but SHE was a Bitch - capital B! - 
After about 7-10 minutes of waiting for us to pack up, she said, and I quote: ""you guys need to hurry up, security is here because this is an eviction""... EXCUSE ME!? We ASKED for security in case our room key did not work because we just checked out at registration after the bullshit we experienced in the casino, being accused of stealing. So don't you rush us after we paid a ton of money for a room and thousands of dollars on gambling! 

The bellhop is another story, oh MAN! We asked him to wait a moment while we got the last of our things.. His response: ""well I need it to be quick because I've got other things to do"" 
OTHER THINGS TO DO!?
Uh???? So you are telling me... That other things are more important than helping guests????

I have never! been so insulted and disrespected by a hotels customer service, especially a shitty one at that!

I came here over the weekend and the room was about $160\/ night. Personally, I only go to Vegas to club so I just needed a roof to cover my head. I really do not make use of the room, so in this case I was not also not picky with the amenities. 

I booked the room with two queen beds and the place was ginormous in comparison to the those on the strip. The beds were bigger, there was a couch and there were pieces of furniture in the room to make makeshift beds out of. WIN!

Like others have said this place is off the strip which is definitely far from the delicious food and FAT TUESDAY stores but we just ate and then headed to the hotel after so that may be something you can arrange if you do decide to stay here.

** TIP: To all the party people, this place is just 6 minutes away from XS so it's not too far. Taxi fares was about $13 bucks so it is not too bad. 

One STAR deduction: 
The toilet was broken and it took 30 minutes for them to come and fix it, definitely not pleasant for those who needed to potty.

stayed 3 nights - first of which in an unrenovated room in the Ipanema tower.  Not impressed.  Bed sucked, and glasswear was dirty.  Check-in dude told us to come back next day to get a new room.

We came back down the next day and talked to someone else who gave us a strip-view in the Masquerade Tower, and it was much nicer.  I enjoyed this tower more - even though I heard some rooms in the Ipanema were renovated more recently.  But, why was glasswear in this tower dirty, too?!?!  

Rooms are hella big when compared to basic rooms everywhere else in Vegas.  Ceiling to floor windows, as well.  Nice.

Free shuttle to strip is a great option.  used it several times.  tip them a buck or two.

Slots seemed about average in terms of return.  Certainly better than the Cosmo.

Sports book was surprisingly decent.  Nothing great, but you can definitely live with it if staying here.

Unfortunately, their free evening show in the Masquerade Tower area was off the three nights we were there.  The big head is pretty disturbing looking, tho.

Four stars for room, but knocked down due to dirty items in it... plus the old rooms at Ipanema.

3 stars for Casino in general... just doesn't have a very energetic vibe.

Valet is slooooowwwww because everyone valets because it is complimentary but it reaches a point where i'd rather just walk to get my own car.  

Bell hop service was BAD! I called down to request my luggage be brought up - they did not ask me for my ticket number and i waited almost an hour for our luggage. Called again and the 2nd person who answered said he did not see my request through my room number - he ""searched"" the computer system over and over for several mins while having me wait - i saw no point in this when he could have just put the order in. DUH!!!

Maid service was okay. We had a lot of decorations in our room so we did not utilize maid service except for request of more towels, blankets, trash bags, and toilet paper. This was not the most prompt service - we had to just ask a maid we saw in the hall.

The room itself was a nice size and not super ugly either. UNTIL i sat on the pull out and it completely CAVED IN. i know i put on some weight after my 2nd pregnancy but i'm definitely not fat. Upon closer inspection rows of springs were MISSING - there was nothing holding up the mattress. Really super dangerous - something that needs attention ASAP. Also 1 out of 2 phones was broken! it wouldn't ring and it would always give a busy tone. 

Dining options in the hotel are not the best. Also is off strip so to get to better dining options you must taxi\/uber. Another weird detail - there were always these guys handing out promo cards for the voodoo club (????) in the casino - kinda annoying and not classy! its like getting stripper cards on the strip. I don't know how effective this is but i DID NOT attend whatever club it was.

I must say I was very happy with my stay here.

I checked in on Easter Sunday, around noon.  The checkin was fast and she was nice.

The room itself was big.  I think they are the biggest standard room in Las Vegas.  Two queen beds, a nice big bathroom, a couch, and floor to ceiling windows.  My view was of the Palms and the mountains, no complaints here.

Next up was the pool, dubbed VooDoo Beach.  It features 4 pools (3 were open).  One pool is more of a beach.  The second pool is kidney shaped, with very warm water.  The third pool was a beautiful fountain in t, but that water was ice water, like Atlantic Ocean water in NH!  There was pool side service, a bar, and a little shop for soda, water, sun tan lotion, etc. Pricey but not surprised given it is poolside in a casino.

The shuttle service to the Strip was good, not great. They run every half hour to Bally's and Harrah's, but there can be too many people to be honest, and it runs from 10am-1am I believe.  I guess you can't complain because it is free.  Out of my four days there, I used it 10 times.  Just once I got fed up and took a cab from Harrah's to Rio, it was less than $11.  It also $7 from Krave to Rio (Krave is a club near Planet Hollywood).

The Show in the Sky is my favorite ""free show"" in Las Vegas.  It just a blast, great music, hot guys and girls, and it turns the casino floor into a party every hour, on the hour, after 6pm.

I would stay here again.  Its a quick walk to The Palms and Gold Coast Casino, and for the most part, a free shuttle away from The Strip.  The rooms are spacious, it'll satisfy your gambling needs for a little less cost than a comparable hotel on the strip.

I stayed here complimentary, by the way.  Im not a big time gambler, though I definitely gamble.  But sign up for the Total Rewards program, the perks are definitely worth it.  Its a shared player's club with 40 casinos nationwide, including Caesars, Harrahs, Flamingo, and Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas.",3,0,0

There were a dozen accidents from LA to the hotel so I arrived at 3 am to check in along with a flood of other guests.

Over a dozen people in line and yet they were incapable of producing additional people to help at the front desk and were limited to 2. On top of that, their computers went down and they sat there like monkeys poking at the random buttons on their keyboards without explaining to the other guests what had happened. Got to the desk after 30 minutes, exhausted, hungry, cold and wanting to check in. I provided my name, my Orbitz confirmation and my Rio confirmation numbers. They asked ""are you sure you booked here?"" No... no, I booked at the motel 6 and thought I'd trick my way onto the Rio instead. Really? They scrambled for another 15 minutes while they searched their systems and ended up with nothing.

Instead of figuring it out,  they charged me full price AGAIN for the room again while Orbitz figured out what happened and I had to walk from my room to the lobby 5 times and wait in line to try and prove that I actually made the reservations. I didn't ever get an apology, just irritation, from them. I called Orbitz and asked then to fax over my confirmation because I didn't trust the Rio staff to do it. Clearly they weren't in the mood. 

Booked a king, got two queens. A few of the elevators on the carnival tower kept making really loud screaming noises, which is the last thing I want to hear from a giant metal box I'm riding. The rooms weren't too sound proof either. I know it's Vegas but buffer the rooms, please! I'm not a kid anymore, I need sleep or I end up cranky and stupid. The music from the pool, that lively little thud, never stopped. Not once. It thudded all night, all morning and throughout the day. I like to play, but I need to recover and that was kind of the point for my getting a hotel room, otherwise I would have parked my butt on the street and just made a makeshift house from White Castle boxes.  We also asked for additional towels but we never got them.

All of the above were just minor annoyances. The thing that really pissed me off was that AFTER 11 am the next day, AFTER maid service they tried to get into the room while we were sleeping to replace the shower curtains. They knocked, we said ""Hello?"" and they came right the hell in. She swiftly apologized and left a second later, then another gentleman tried to do the exact same thing an hour later! I said ""I'm in here!"" this time but he still came in! He apologized and told me he wanted to change the shower curtains. I told him to give it to me and that I'd take care of it and to please leave. I tossed the precious shower curtains in the closet. 

Two days later I'm in line waiting to check out at 11 and AGAIN THEY'RE SHORT STAFFED. You would think (THINK!) that they would provide some additional attendants to deal with the 11 am check out rush. Nope.

I'm over this place. The casino is dirty, the rooms were horrible, their service was utter garbage and I don't like paying for all of this stress when all I wanted to do was get away for a few days. Next time I'll just stick with my White Castle box room idea. 

Try the LinQ, their hotel is beautiful inside and out and it costs almost identical to the Rio.

FYI all of their restaurants inside close around 10, except their disgusting pizza stand\/booth and the overpriced Voodoo lounge (which charges cover).

Rio, it was fun but all you did was leave a nasty memory like a crazy ex.

Edit: it took two weeks a dozen phone calls to Rio, Caesars Palace wholesale department, their billing department and to Orbitz but they're FINALLY being magnanimous enough to return MY money for the double charge. I had to provide them with multiple invoices and outlined every single item so thoroughly a monkey could have figured it out.",4,4,0

Here's the experience:
Incompetent concierge tells us on the phone that we can check in early (noonish). Apparently this did not mean actually getting our room but rather some pre-registration nonsense that kept us out until 4 due to their failure to specify.

The line at check-in was 40 minutes long and only 4 counters were attended. I parked in the garage which is inconveniently far from the hotel rooms, and they refuse to let me use a luggage cart unless I have a bellhop with me. What, are they afraid I am going to steal it? Honestly?

Our room itself, is actually quite nice. This is somewhat redeeming for them. Except the refrigerator wasn't on and I had to call twice to get someone to fix it. 

8:00pm on night 1: NOWHERE TO PARK. There is some Italian festival nearby and nobody is attending either garage to make sure actual hotel guests have a place to put their vehicle. After 45 mins of trying, gave up to go pick up friends at airport half an hour early. Disgraceful.

Called concierge to get answers to some questions just before 9pm on night 1. Got an answering machine...I wouldnt mind waiting on hold until someone was available, but ten bucks says we don't get a call back.

Horrible sewage smell outside that did not go away.

The shower literally takes 20 minutes or more before I get even lukewarm water running through it.

Going into nights 2 and 3 our friend's meal credit was screwed up more than once by the hotel staff. Ours, luckily, worked as intended. 

All in all, our first night there made me want to give this place less than one star. The incompetent, inconsiderate, or just illiterate hotel staff was infuriating and the venue of the WSOP should be classier than this. I should never see a line going out the door to check in  to the hotel on a Tuesday and there are three or more vacant check-in counters that could be getting used. 

The restaurant staff on the other hand was all very friendly, but I will review those places separately.

ROOM:
My friend booked the regular queen suite.  All rooms are suites so our room was huge.  In addition to the two queen beds, there was a living room area and a long counter space which also served as the bathroom vanity and included an in room safe and mini fridge.  Our room was clean but fixtures are clearly outdated.  Our bathtub was clogged and didn't drain fast enough so you feet sat in a pool of your shower water.  Our friend stayed on another floor and he said his room looked more outdated than ours.

Housekeeping was a huge issue.  We were here during one of Vegas' biggest weekends of the year.  Before we went to dinner, I called housekeeping at 8pm to ask to clean my room.  They told me they didn't have time but they could bring us towels and toiletries.  People leave their rooms at all hours of the night so not being properly staffed at 8pm was ridiculous.  I said we would be leaving our room so they could come in and leave the towels on our bed.  When we got back a few hours later, I was appauled to see what had happened.  They left all the towels in front of our hotel door...ON THE FLOOR.  Disgusting and so unsanitary!

Next time, I'd rather pay a bit more to stay on the strip at a place boasting better rooms and better service.

First of all, staff all over the hotel is exceptional!! The hotel desk lady, the valet people, the dealers, the guy who brought up our luggage, and the restaurants' staff were all VERY friendly and accommodating. Service was prompt when calling for more towels -- less than 10 minutes -- when at other Vegas hotels I've waited nearly an hour for such a service!!

I'm not sure how much it is to stay here, but the man said he got a ""GREAT DEAL"" through his Total Rewards card. You know, that little card you can get and stick in the slot machines and gain points. Apparently he's spent enough money at the Rio and some of its sister properties so that we could get a very very low room rate. Cool!

The rooms are all suites and are spacious. 

The restaurants in this hotel are some of the best, in my opinion. 

Carnival World Buffet = I think this is the biggest buffet in Vegas. The downside is it always has a long line to get in. You could be waiting over 30 minutes. This is one of my favorite buffets though.

Village Seafood Buffet = OMG. This may be my new favorite buffet EVER. it was soooo good. They had other things besides seafood too...the prime rib was exceptional!! Loads of different variations of shrimp, clams, seafood mixes, etc. Drool.

Buzios seafood restaurant = this is a sit-down restaurant. I actually got a steak here since we had had the seafood buffet the night before.The steak was perfect, and the sides of mushrooms and garlic mashed potatoes were perfect as well. The man got some sort of creamy seafood dish which was very rich. The place is pricey but not outrageous.

All American cafe located near the Starbucks = GREAT food for decent prices. I got a delicious shrimp and linguine last year here, and this year I got a caesar salad with new york steak on top. The steak was cooked to perfection and very flavorful. The waiter also came by and gave us a GIGANTIC slice of red velvet cake, for free!!! (i guess it was extra?)

Make sure to use your Total rewards card at every restaurant because you get a discount!

The pool area, called VooDoo Beach, is really fun. They have 4 pools and plenty of room. Lots of places to sit. There's also a place to get some decent food and two bars! One of the pools is 21 and over which is nice because there's no kids. But, men have to pay to get in that one. It is fenced off and private.

They have a rooftop lounge which provides a fabulous view of Vegas. I think it was only 10 dollars a person -- don't quote me on that, but I don't remember it being overly expensive at all. It was not very crowded or ""hopping"" but the view was definitely worth it to take some pictures and stuff.

I give the hotel 4 stars instead of 5 because I feel like the hotel could use a renovation as far as style of the rooms...it's pretty outdated. Also, when you go to pick up your car from Valet in the morning, it takes foreverrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.",3,0,0

First off, I booked a room with a view of the strip. What I got was a room next to the elevator with a view of the roof of the building. I can hear the elevator whizzing by at all hours of the night. Also, the door has a lock where the privacy switch doesn't work. What does that mean? Well, when you decide to leave the room and close the door, the switch swings around in a full circle because it's loose and malfunctions. Meaning, the door thinks it's in privacy mode and doesn't allow you to get back into your room with your own key. I learned this the hard way. 

Had a security guard show up when I called the front desk. He had no idea what was going on. So he called for back up. Back up came in the form of an EMT worker. He had an override key. He was able to open the room door but he didn't know what was going on. His explanation; door needs a new battery. Wrong answer. They submitted a ""work order"" which never was addressed. We were on our way down to the front desk to find a solution when a different security guard saw us and asked if we needed help. I had to repeat the story again. As I'm explaining it, a floor manager walks by, looks directly at us and keeps going. Doesn't stop to help or try to fix the situation or move us to a different room. Nothing. Anyways, security guard number two came up to our room and explained the privacy switch situation. He said he would submit a work order and should be resolved in 20 minutes. Did that happen; NOPE. Came back two hours later and still not fixed.

Called front desk for an update, was on hold for 20 minutes, she said someone will come by shortly. It's been another 20 minutes and still nobody came.

It wasn't until we complained that a room miraculously became available; go figure! Upon arriving in the room we found a clogged sink, toilet paper that is one grade lower than sand paper, and fewer amenities than you come to expect at all MOTELS.  

After leaving for several hours the next day, the cleaning service did not make it to our room so we just got towels from the cart so we would not be subjected to disruption.

We originally had booked the MGM Grand, however due to hurricane Irma our flight got delayed and the MGM Grand couldn't accommodate our new dates since they are booked because of the fight.  So we scrambled to find a hotel and came across the Rio.  

I have to say that based on the reviews I read I wasn't expecting very much and honestly a little worried.  We checked in yesterday and are checking out on Monday.  Upon arriving our room wasn't ready so we hung around and came back at 3.  Check in at the kiosk was simple and a breeze.  They even gave us coupons to use around Vegas.  Once we got to our room we were very pleased.  We are staying in the Deluxe King Mountain View.  The room is very spacious and clean.  It has the feeling of a studio apartment.  Our view of the mountains is nice, however being on the 4th floor of the Ipanema tower also comes with a view of the roof. Not the best.

The casino is much smaller than most on the strip but has it's charm.  Very easy access to Ride share where you can pick up a Uber or Lyft.  We used this several times so far to get to the strip since the Rio is located off the strip.

My only major complain is the bed. The mattress is not a plush pillowtop that other casinos provide.  It's basically a box spring mattress that is hard and a bit uncomfortable. We have been waking up sore, but the water massages by the pool help with the muscle aches.

All in all I am not sure why there are so many bad reviews for this hotel.  For the money you spend it's a great option and a nice hotel. I would definitely come stay here again and maybe upgrade to a different room in hopes the bed will be better.",1,1,1

My friends & I will for sure never ever consider Rio as our hotel stay for a Vegas trip ever again.  However, most employees (such as housekeeping & the servers) were super nice & helpful. So here's my experience at Rio:

1st thing we noticed when checking into our room was the animal urine\/piss smell. So I dialed ""0"" for the front desk to report it.  All she could say was she'll send housekeeping to clean it for us. (Wtf can they really do to ""clean"" the smell other than to spray air freshners in the room just to mask it?) So I told them we wanted another room... She wouldn't give us one & even insisted that we can upgrade to another room for extra charge. (They gave us a room that smelled like pee in the first place.) So I even resorted to request for a ""smoking room"" cause we'd rather smell smoke than urine. But she said that we'd still have to wait til the next day to transfer us to another room. Meaning we'd still have to sleep in the ""urine"" room for one night.  Then she tries to tell me that it's been raining the past few days in Vegas & that's why we're smelling this stench & that it's from the humidity.  Such bullshit! 

So we stuck it out & slept in this room for the night.  Since we were only staying for 2 nights we decided to stay in the room because we were too tired & didn't want to waste time packing & moving our belongings to another room. (Keep in mind also that front desk never bothered to check on us.) The following day we realized how ghetto the room really was. 1) The room stunk of piss. 2) The bathroom toilet paper holder was broken. 3) Black electric tape covered over light switches because the switches lights up orange in the dark. 4) Found disgusting pubic hair in the shower before our first shower in that room. 

I really tried to enjoy my stay at Rio by exploring their casino & other entertainments. But what pushed me to the limit was when I was playing the ""Big Wheel"" game.  A female server approached all the male players asking if they needed a drink. But she never once asked me if I wanted anything and I was thirsty AF. I confirmed this by asking the other male players if she had come by to ask them for drinks & she did. So not happy at all with my recent Vegas experience.  

I might come back to try their famous seafood buffet or watch a show. But I will never book a room here again.",6,0,0

The conference space is good, lots of smaller rooms for breakout sessions, and the main rooms for dinner\/keynote are spacious and well lit. The restrooms are well kept and properly stocked. Conference food was about what you'd expect, acceptable. Staff was friendly.

It is a pretty tired hotel. Just about every lampshade in the accommodation corridor was broken\/cracked, like someone had punched them all. The carpet was fixed with duct tape. We were in room 1129 in the Ipanena tower. The shower in our room had two settings - a lot of water, and really a lot of water, like being hosed. Standard of cleanliness was ok, but when the walls are marked and the carpet stained, it's hard for anyone to make it look really clean. The windows needed cleaning. The curtains were off their hooks in several places, and were hard to open and close. We found the beds comfortable enough, and the sound proofing was ok. The room was large and spacious, and the bathroom had a separately located sink, which was useful.  

We found the guy on the check-in desk to be rather frosty. He didn't give us a map of the hotel, which we begged off the concierge later. Check out was better - we opted for email receipt and were able to leave our bag with the bell hop.

The ground floor is full of casino tables and slot machines as you'd expect. You have to navigate through these to get to the hotel area and the food outlets. We ate at the Chinese restaurant on our first night, which was just about ok - rather a lot of MSG, and the chicken with cashew nuts literally had six cashews in it.  Breakfast on first morning at the Hash House A Go Go, pretty standard breakfast menu, large portions, nothing special. Breakfast on the second morning at the World Carnival Buffet. We had 90 minutes to kill and nearly ate ourselves to death. That was good.

Being off the strip is a disadvantage if you have portions of time to use up. During the day on Saturday we took the complimentary shuttle over to the strip and were able to be tourists, looking at The Venetian and other hotels. We had to wait 30 mins for the shuttle back. On Sunday we had a couple of hours we could have used for more tourism if we'd been closer to the strip, but we didn't want to rush or risk it. If we came back to Las Vegas for vacation, we'd definitely go to a hotel on the strip.

This all-suite hotel offers rates similar to those on-strip hotels except you're getting 600+ sq ft of space.  The space, the double sinks, extra fridge, shelves, floor length mirrors, etc. were definitely appreciated but I just couldn't shake this large studio apartment feel off my standard suite.

The Rio was just a little too serene for the hustle and bustle I wanted out of Las Vegas.

There was a blackout during our stay at the Masquerade tower.  All the lights went out as soon as we opened our room door.  I sorta thought that it was us who short circuited the place!  :O  So glad we were able to get into our room because the hallway was completely dark without any emergency lights.  We called front desk right away and they sent out security to investigate, so they said.  It wouldn't have been too bad if our room wasn't right next to the emergency stairway and we heard all the banging of the staircase and talking from everyone who was walking down.  That was very loud and scary.  We did not hear from front desk or security again.  We tried to call front desk a while later for updates but was put on hold rather indefinitely.

It had a wonderful view of the strip (backside of Bellagio and Ceasers) and was spacious with a king bed and sectional couch.  The TV had a line going down the middle of it but we barely used it anyway.  The mini-bar was expensive ($9 for a Keurig coffee cup) but I guess that is standard in Vegas.  There was a separate mini fridge available so we could store water bottles and beer we purchased at a grocery store nearby.

I thought the amenities, bars, restaurants, and casino floor were very nice.  I think the piece that was most lacking was an engaged hotel staff.

We stayed in the Masquerade Tower.  Our room was large, with a couch, had a fridge (in addition to the honor fridge) and a room safe which I like so you can have a place to securely lock up your winnings (HA!).   

The carpet had a big stain near the entrance and the sofa had a few small stains as well.  There were also cigarette burns in it.  They also haven't upgraded to flat screen TV's yet (at least in our room).  

The bed was on the firm side and slightly uncomfortable.  I found the pillows also firm and flat.  Needless to say, I didn't sleep well.  

A weird thing, but both rolls of toilet paper only had less than and 1\/8 of the roll left and there was no spare. You would have thought at least one of the rolls would have been changed.

First of all, they are not ALL suites. Just because it is a little bigger and has a couch, it is not a suite. Suites have separate spaces. 

The reason for the snarky all stains remark? Stains....everywhere! In the elevator lobby, in the hallways, on the frayed carpet in our room, on the ceilings, on the couch, on the SHEETS. Our supposedly fresh set of sheets had what appeared to be old blood stains, vomit, or coffee. Either way, disgusting and unacceptable. I called housekeeping and they did not apologize but one of the maids came and changed them out within an hour. However, our regular maid does not vacuum and steals change. There was also sticky stuff stuck to the carpet right in front of the sink.

During one of the busiest times of the summer (WSOP and BCA\/CSI pool tournaments) they allowed an elevator to be broken for 2 weeks and another broke a few days ago. They finally fixed the recently broken one, but that other one seems to be like the elevator on Big Bang Theory....perpetually out of order. This caused a major jam and sometimes it would take 15 minutes to catch an elevator up to your room and 10 minutes to get downstairs because it stopped on every floor. 

It was our first time here in Vegas, so we went to see the other hotels on the Strip. Wow. I was impressed by those other places, with their good variety of restaurants, features and shops, non-reeking casinos and cleanliness. I was a little disappointed  when it was time to hop on the free shuttle back to Rio, (the only amenity I know of besides soap).

I could keep going about the hotel fighting us to pay waived resort fees, the Strip View being a view of the railroad tracks and air conditioning fans, serving raw hamburger in the Billiard Cafe, or not having running water for 5 hours, but I'll spare you those details. I'll end with the only positive: the day spa. The women there are super nice, treat you like a queen, and the services are top-notch.

Rio was a decent hotel, though I would probably try to stay elsewhere in the future. The beds are comfy, the towels nice and full, and the water pressure is so good it almost shoots you through the wall like Kramer in that one episode of Seinfeld. The room service was tricky though, as the three times we called down for it they were operating on a 1-2 hour wait. We only ate at the Grand Buffet and the American Grille. Both places were just ok for where and what they are. Nothing great.

The pool area was lovely for lying in the sunshine, but I imagine gets crowded with a full hotel. The desk and bell staff were all very friendly and helpful, as were most of the food servers. Every single person greeted me with a 'hello' as I passed them in the halls, from the housekeeping staff to the bellmen and room service servers. 

Everything is expensive, and that's a bummer (but I guess it's like that in a lot of the Strip area). $14 for an Amstel Light and a Bloody Mary, for example.",1,0,0

The Rio is obviously not a preferred hotel for me, but for convenience I chose to stay there. As I hate most of the food options at the WSOP, I bring my own food and supplies with me to keep in the room. I had a large bag filled to the top with Tupperware, silver wear, plates, cups, vitamins, etc. It was all kept in a brown grocery bag by the refrigerator in the room. On the second day there, the housekeeper must have taken the bag out of the room, (I'll assume mistakenly, although I can't image how anyone could have thought a bag filled to the top with all that stuff was garbage). In any case, I filed a security report and they said they would get back to me. After not hearing from anyone in a couple days, I went down to the front desk to speak with the manager. I was received by Cheree, the hotel manager on duty. I can best describe her as a character right off the Jerry Springer show. Sure enough, all I received from her was a lot of attitude, and was told they spoke to the maid who denied taking anything from my room. She said their investigation revealed no wrongdoing, so too bad for you. They offered nothing in compensation. Frankly, the value of the stuff taken wasn't so much, probably $200 to $300, but I was now going to have to waste a morning of my trip driving around to replace everything. They could have offered a free buffet or two, maybe waived a few nights of the resort fee, or something. But no, Cheree just stood there relishing in the fact that she could stick it to me on this one. In poker terms, the Rio is the nut low.",1,0,0

- Very spacious and clean room, even if just a bit outdated.
- Front desk was very nice and courteous, both during check in and check out.
- Friendly staff.
- Hotel is right next to I-15, so there's easy highway access.
- Complimentary shuttles to the strip.

Cons:
- Not too great of a dining selection. You're probably better off finding mom and pop restaurants down the street.

Customer service is not good either. The first room we had had a wet carpet floor, so the front desk gave us another room. Room 664 did not have soap etc. I had to call front desk to get soap. The hotel is outdated and needs new carpets. 
Upon checkout we had to pay a resort fee of 18 dollars per night plus a 12% tax rate which could not be waived. Even though the rooms for two nights is suppose to be comp. There were no signs , front desk did not even tell us there is a resort fee , etc. What is the point of a free couple of nights at Rio if you still have to pay for a resort fee. Complimentary means free not HIDDEN FEES!  

To put this in perspective .... The Gold Coast Casino which is next door DOES NOT charge you a dime when they give you complimentary nights. Gold Coast staff is friendly, have good restaurants open late at night, and provides shuttle services. And oh yeah...they have signs all over the front desk telling you there is a resort fee of 9.99 per night so you are aware of the fees. 

The good:
They have a free shuttle that takes you to the strip every 30 minutes until 1am. Hotel is outdated but is in ok condition.

The bad:
Resort Fees are hidden.

Not not on the strip.
Hotel is out dated.

A mini-fridge accompanied the outside sink which paralleled the mirrored sliding doors for or to a closet.  This room also had a restroom, nothing fancy mentioning about... I'd say overall an average of 3 stars.

Casino:
As for the gaming goes, I give it 4 stars, for the slots to the poker tables it lacked people and variety or which i like to call ""flavor"", the choices of slots were the usuals and old fashioned;  Texas Tea is an old one but its actually one of my favorites.  They also had a new version on it called the Texas Tina but didn't pay out. As for the Poker room, only had 3 tables all $1\/$3 no-limit.  All the other games were the standard games.

Buffet:
Carnival something. I'd say this one is the better buffet out of the seven available for 30 bucks. Got to try out Caesars and Planet Hollywood as well.  Make sure u put it on your rewards card because that bracelet is a pain in the ass to have for 24hrs.

We tried to use the self check in kiosk because the line was LOOONG to check in with a front desk clerk. Only two people were working with about ten people in line (and growing). The kiosk checked us into a room, but would not print out keys and asked us to stand in line. Kind of a hassle, but not a big deal. 

After 15 or so minutes we make our way to a very stressed out woman who finally went behind the counter and asked to help us. She prints our keys and we make the long walk to the room. We used the keys she provided to open the door and IT IS SOMEONE ELSES ROOM THAT IS STILL CHECKED IN. Their belongings are EVERYWHERE, they obviously weren't planning on leaving. But we got checked into another room!!! Luckily these people weren't there at the moment, but imagine if they were! Seeing people use a key to open the door to your hotel room. 

When we went back to the front desk, the same woman just gave us a new key... said we should be ""understanding"" and that the kiosk is the source of the issue, not her double checking the room we got checked into before printing out new keys. She didn't apologize once, or try to talk to us, let us speak to her, answer any questions or offer any answers besides ""it's the kiosks fault, they're new"". , She didn't even offer SOMETHING for the inconvenience of being checked into another persons room, she handed us new keys and walked away. No apology, resort credit, room comp, tickets to a show, discounts or coupons to anything offered on site, or even a LATE CHECK OUT was offered. 

I totally get it's stressful (and I work retail so I know) but it was handled horribly. In most customer service industries you try to compensate people for errors on your part (whether you personally or something at your place of work, machines, etc.) but we received none of that at the rio. 

It was a terrible experience and when I tell people about how we weren't checked into another persons room, given keys, and offered NOTHING in return, they're appalled.

As much as I love seafood, this was just a tad of an overkill. I think I stopped eating shrimp for a year after this trip. I don't remember the hotel casinos and lobbies much because this was during a time when I was immensely confused as to why Las Vegas hotels were different and I could never find a clear path between the lobby and the elevators but I do remember being comfortably situated in the armrest chair in our suite while being very uncomfortably over stuffed with seafood.

Rio is a bit of a walk. Yes, we actually walked from Rio to the strip.  This involved crossing a freeway, not as much fun as you would think it is. I wish we rented a car, but renting a car in Vegas is almost pointless since for the most part most people confine themselves to a walkable distance within the strip.

Based on my experiences the past four years, this was a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. It's convenient to stay there during the Star Trek convention, but every time I have problems that make my stay miserable.

This past trip (August 2014):

We learned that the bartenders at Shutters and Masquerade were rounding up charges! For example, if you got a receipt with your beer, it showed $7.11 .. but they charged $7.25 or $7.50. Long story short, I worked my way up to their SVP of Legal who said it was NOT a corporate policy to do this (even though I found out they don't have small coins in the cash drawers ... hmm) and it was an ""isolated incident' even though more than two dozen people confirmed my findings. I think they get enough of our money, but to cheat us as well? Reprehensible.

1. Tiny closet with four hangars in it.
2. Called housekeeping for more hangars, took an hour to arrive, and some didn't fit the closet rack.
3. No ashtrays in a smoking room, and when requested, took 90 minutes for them to arrive.
4. Air conditioning return duct was clotted with dust and filth (allergies went off the chart as soon after I arrived)
5. Overall room is mediocre ... I asked for a great room based on prior year issues, and they gave me a Mountain View King Samba Suite. It looks like it was decorated by a sightless, color blind person. Not the ""fabulous"" room I was promised.
6. They call them suites, but really it is a slightly oversized hotel room with a wall.
7. Don't look behind the TV\/refrigerator cabinet unless you like viewing dirt and dust from the Reagan years.
8. A refrigerator! Great!! Except it froze all the food I put in there.
9. Minibar was not serviced before I arrived, and there was a half-eaten Rice Krispie bar in there from the prior tenant.
10. ""High Speed Wifi"" is not what they offer. Speeds are slower that dial up! If you are tech-savvy: I ran a speed test and download speed was 1.5; upload was .75. Yes. POINT SEVEN FIVE!! (Run a speedtest.net on your own and compare.) When I complained they admitted they had to upgrade their system. This is not only atrocious but false advertising - especially as they are aware of the issue.

The shuttle to the strip only goes to Harrah's or Bally's, so if you want to go to the other side of the strip (i.e. Mandalay Bay, New York New York, etc.) get ready for a lot of walking or taxi riding.  I would actually encourage riding the taxi if you have a group of 3-5 people because the ride to either end of the strip is only about $10 (about $12 w\/ tip), and that's not too much off from if you were to take a shuttle and tip a couple dollars per person - plus there's practically no wait time for a taxi.

Some of the shuttle drivers were ok, but one in particular did not let our friend on with a small roller bag.  We told him that we had come on with bigger bags the day before and he basically told us, ""Well not on MY bus.""

Pool hours are only 9 AM to 6 PM so if you have your heart set on a night swim or hot tub, don't stay at the Rio.  Also, it's $22 for a day pass to the gym.  I don't know if that's normal for Vegas, but it made me a little sad to not be able to work out before going to so many buffets...

The Carnival World Buffet was only okay (still think Planet Hollywood's Spice buffet is better), but I will say that  this buffet's dessert section was pretty amazing.  If you try the Carnival buffet you HAVE to have one of the little fruit tarts at the dessert section.  My friend asked me what I thought the cookie base was made of and I told them that they must be baked with magic...

Rooms are definitely not as big as they're made out to be.  With it being an ""All-Suite"" hotel, we thought that the place was going to be huge, but it seemed like just a slightly larger regular room with a couch.  My friends and I were running on a budget, so we shared six to a room (two to each bed, one on the couch and one on the floor) without many problems, but I still don't know if I'd call it a suite.",0,0,0

I knew this was an older hotel but still decided to stay here regardless. The rooms were very large compared to other hotels I've stayed at. The beds were comfortable and the view was great. The big plus and something that I really liked and appreciated about this hotel was their toiletries. They not only provide the basic lotion, shampoo and conditioner but they also had a dental kit with a toothbrush, toothpaste and mouthwash ! And that's not all they also provided a shaving kit, which included a razor and shaving creme! How awesome is that ?! This is the first time I've seen this and it's the most common things that I always tend to forget! The get huge thumbs up for this. 

The one thing that did make me upset was that when we arrived after going out on Saturday night they had ""too many"" cars in their valet and we had to self park. They sent us to a parking garage and our truck did not fit in the garage so we had to come back and ask to be sent elsewhere ! So frustrating having to find parking at 3 am when all I wanted to do was get to my room and sleep. 

The restaurant Hash a gogo was tasty. Had their breakfast and the dishes were huge. I do wish they would have told us this when we ordered a massive flapjack for each kid in our party, when all 4 could have probably shared one. 
The buffet was delicious and they and bottomless mimosas that morning, it was perfect.

The RIO Hotel staff, managers, supervisors, restaurant manager along with hostess', and their security lack customer service skills and any human skills to be exact. I Just stayed at the RIO Hotel from 12\/20-12\/23 with a large party of 12 and had booked 5 rooms. Two of our rooms had a breakfast buffet included each morning for the duration of our stay. We attempted to use this the morning after check-in and was given hell at the cashier at the carnival buffet after waiting in line for 1 hr, another 45 min. wasted on incompetent cashier that didn't understand and for the front desk giving her wrong info. After 1 hr. 45 min, my husband aggravated along with 11 others in the group, patiently waiting to finally eat, when the hostess threw our receipts on the ground after telling her to please hurry up and seat us because of the long wait. She deliberately threw the receipts on the floor and ignored our party and deliberately took the party behind us. Upset and beyond shocked on what occurred, my husband started yelling and raising his voice on what occurred. This brought the restaurant assistant manager Abby, came to the scene defending her hostess and wasted no time talking to us, but rather doing nothing except for calling security and refusing our parties service. All we wanted at this point, was an apology, respect and to sit and eat. She said we weren't welcomed and we had to leave and they would refund us our $. After telling security we weren't leaving all we wanted was to be served, they told us to leave. We were escorted out by 2 security guards that had no regard for what happened in the restaurant and chose not to listen to our side of the story only the assistant manager. They lead our group out all the way to the reception desk as if we were drug dealers or had stole something. The head of security, Richard, was the only sympathetic and apologetic person we saw through the whole ordeal. He advised that he had no control over on the restaurant level and that the assistant manager Abby, has the authority to deny service to anyone. He walked back to the restaurant to receive our refund and Richard remained with us the whole time. We asked him to speak to the hotel manager to reflect on what just happened at the carnival buffet and to receive some type of apology.  Pamela Irion, hotel manager came to the scene and very quickly wasted no time to defend  the RIO staff and saw that we were at fault. She basically said they're private owned and showed no regard for what happened. I told her we were expecting an apology and maybe you as a hotel manager would care about the customer and keeping the customer happy for long term business and would offer our party a complimentary alternative. She immediately responded and said that that's not something she would do and refused. At this point, we were disgusted by the whole ordeal and our  stay at the hotel. We left to another hotel to eat and returned back in the evening and at this time walked by the front desk and asked to speak to a general manager, they told us he was on vacation and settled to talk with another hotel manager, Giacomo ""Jack"" D'Aleo who right Off the bat talked with a tone of voice that us in acceptable claiming that my husband looked at him in a intimidating way and he could understand why the carnival buffet ordeal happened. We were merely having a normal tone conversation and he was accusing us and again had no desire to hear anything from us. After getting no where with ""Jack"" did he end the conversation abruptly and we walked our way to the rooms. After about 1 hr., seating in my room, I found a knock at the door....a huge security guard along with ""Jack,"" D'Aleo hotel manager, asking to speak with me. I had thought that after leaving him downstairs he came to his sense and was coming to apologize but in fact threatening us that if anything else happens from myself or anyone in my party that our rooms are considered ""TERMINATED"".......really! All I know after they left my room, did my party and I come to realize that this was all due to DISCRIMINATION, I urge you not to waste your time and $. Paying a little extra $ to stay at a 5-Star hotel to ensure your family a good time is priceless. Just think of it as discounted price = no customer service!",1,0,0

I attributed my bad prior experiences to the fact that they were renovating.  Now that renovations have been complete for a while, I can state with confidence that it's a systemic problem with the property.

(By the way, calling this place ""All Suites"" is misleading.  I consider a ""suite"" to include a separate sitting area from the bedroom; my room was just a large room.  If that's the standard, all hotels are ""all suites."")

Check-in is a nightmare.  If you can get the online check-in system to work, do yourself a favor and do it--it will cut your time at the front desk in half.  Sadly, it will not cut it down to near-zero; you'll still have to stand in line, no matter when you get there.  Oh, and if you want to check in early, they'll be happy to do that--for a significant fee.

Although the conference center is nice, the hotel is far below the standards they claim to aim for (and price for).  Despite recent renovations, the carpets are shabby, the bedding (mattress and linens) and other furnishings are cheap and uncomfortable, and the construction workmanship is shoddy (poorly grouted\/caulked tiles, loose fixtures, etc).

But that stuff pales in comparison to what I can only describe is a ""chiseling"" financial policy.  When I booked the room, I was told to expect a ""resort"" fee--unfortunately, the latest scam from hotels in Vegas and elsewhere--that would cover services I had no use for, like admission to the spa, as well as bottom-tier internet access.  The confirmation email had three different rates quoted--$18, $20, and $22 per day.  I've also seen $24 and $28, as though they are raising the ""resort"" fee so fast they can't keep up with what they're telling guests.  Prices at the vending machines on the floors are outrageous--but those are topped only by the even higher prices at the gift shop for the same items! 

The food options...cripes, they far overcharge for substandard quality. You can get much better food elsewhere for a lot less money.

On the resort fee, it took me an hour on the phone, two escalations, and hints at a class-action lawsuit for unfair trade practices before a hotel manager would agree to honor the $18\/day I was quoted.  (In fairness, she did also agree to refund one day of that for my trouble.)

Incredibly, they also attempted to charge me an additional $14\/day for internet access, even though their ""resort fee"" also supposedly covered that!  

Checkout is nearly as bad as check-in.  Good luck with the online checkout--but don't dare just leave.  Most hotels you can trust to get it right or to fix the problem with one phone call if your bill isn't what you'd expect, but I wouldn't trust these jokers with a ham sandwich.

The bottom line for this off-strip hotel:  Stay far, far away from it.  For the same amount of money, you can find a comfortable room in good condition, ON THE STRIP, with reasonable prices for amenities, and with helpful staff and honest management--just not at the Rio. 

If I could give this place zero stars, I would.",4,2,1

 A few notes:

HOTEL ROOM
-- Decently sized. A bunch of people who want to save money and aren't going to be spending a lot of time in the hotel should stay here.
-- Out-dated. I could also hear the water running through the pipes making a knocking sound run underneath the sink I was at when my BF was using the other one. The bathtub had a leaky spout too. 
-- We didn't even get the room we BOOKED! We reserved a King bed with a view of the strip, instead we got a room with 2 Queen sized beds and a view of construction and an empty lot in the back.

CASINO
-- There was only one cocktail waitress going around in the section of slots I was in. Not fun when you want to get your drink on while gambling.
-- I could do without the random cocktail waitress karaoke performances throughout the night. Just get off the stage and serve drinks, no wonder I can't find you guys!
-- Small in comparison to the other casinos in Vegas.

So yeah, instead of playing craps I am sitting here twiddling my thumbs. Thanks, Rio. 

Update:  The snaker didn't show up. Called again and now we have to change rooms. So my mom's and my birthday weekend is ruined. First of two nights spent in hotel room waiting and then moving rooms. The guy who was supposed to call back with an update but he didn't so I had to wait on hold FOR THE FOURTH TIME. Found out he changed the room but didn't call me back.

Pros:
+Comfy beds. Seriously, these beds were the best I've ever slept in while in Vegas. I couldn't say anything about the pillows because I brought my own, but they were good to hug as I fell asleep!

+Large rooms. Four suitcases and 3 people in one room? No problem! The bathroom had a sink on the outside and inside (they had a dressing room area), so we could all get ready for the day without having to wait long.

+The Buffet is really tasty. Expensive, but worth it at least once.

+The valet people outside are real gentlemen. There was one named Oscar that was just spectacular and he deserves a raise! They ask if you need directions and try to be as helpful and friendly as possible.

+The pool! So warm and inviting, I wish I could have swam more this trip. I would love to come back to go to the European-style pool (aka the Topless pool) so I can get a nice tan!

Cons:

+FINDING A FECES COVERED WASHCLOTH IN MY BATHROOM. EW. EW. EW!!!!!!
SERIOUSLY.
EW.

Why would you have room cleaning if they don't do actual cleaning? Our carpet wasn't vacuumed when we first got in and then I found the gem above. Thank goodness that they picked it up and apologized, because seriously. EW.

-13.95 internet? Really? I work from my computer, so having to pay that cuts into my paycheck. Plus it was super slow and not worth the price.

-Blackjack was $25.00 minimum MOST of the days I was there...including Monday! WHY? Just because they have a $5 automated machine doesn't mean that you should have such expensive tables. I felt a little cheated because I just had to throw my money at machines to just have fun. Their machines are tight too, no such thing as a loose machine here.

-Lack of food. No fast food, at least. The rest was pricey, including the cafe that was only open for breakfast. Seriously Rio, you want us to pay `12.00 for 3 pancakes? Unbelievable.


As ""nice"" as it was, I probably won't ever ever stay here again. Visit for fun? Yes....but on someone else's dollar. I'm not rich enough to even really step foot in this place and it's not even on the strip!

(Oh, and the room was comped most of the time except one night and I have no idea what the price of the room was so I can't talk about their prices.)",5,3,1

Service was non-existent, room was atrocious & unkempt.  TV was ridiculously placed in the room so it was not convenient for you to watch from the couch or the bed, and the bathroom set-up was an even bigger nightmare.

I tried ordering a pot of hot water from room service so I could have my tea in the evenings and I was told ""we don't do that anymore"".  I know another person was there and bribed housekeeping for a coffee pot.  BRIBED!  Didn't know a guest would have to do that.

My billing statement was screwed up and billing customer service had to be called twice to rectify the problems.  My first call to customer service was rude!  

Last year I was accosted in the elevator and security and management were of no help.  Blew it off like it was nothing.

Gaming tables were all at a higher min bet during the WSOP which was off putting.  

The best thing going at the Rio is the sports deli has the best chicken wings and the Vietnamese food section wonton mein is excellent.

The room we got last time had two beds and a pull out bed and even with all that the room was huge.

If you're concerned about all the little details about your room then you are not partying in Vegas at all.

You are allowed to smoke in the hallways next to the elevators, in case you are a smoker.

The Rio also has, in my opinion, THE best buffet in all of Vegas. I've been to the Bellagio and the thing that disappointed me most was they didn't have everything I wanted.

It was the most reasonable in cost and a short distance to the strip. Since my husband and I arrived first we decided to upgrade our room to a suite so that everyone can hangout comfortably before retiring to their individual rooms. Well we were given the Star McCormick Suite (Room 20029) on the 20th floor in the Masquerade tower. Upon first entering, the room seemed to be amazing. It was about 1600 sq. ft. with a beautiful strip view, floor to ceiling windows, living & dining areas, 1\/2 guest bath. The bedroom had a separate jetted tub & shower and a water closet (toilet room) as well as double sinks and separate vanity and stool. The floor to ceiling windows carried all the way through the entire suite, even the bathroom! The decor seemed to be updated to besides the wood tables that were beat up but had glass places on the top. Here's where things turned a bit. 

The wet bar in the dining area had a sink that only had cold water because the hot water didn't work, the guest bath door would stay closed, the phone in the living area didn't work because it was not even plugged in and the plug was under a plate in the floor that had to be removed first. The phone in the bedroom you could hardly hear on it, there was a high pitched intermittent noise coming from the tub area. Some of the lights didn't work and the main door would automatically close after opening it. We called about these issues and maintenance came to fix what they could and tickets were opened for the other issues. By the time we left on Tuesday, those issues were still present.

When my family checked in on late Friday evening, they didn't get the rooms they were promised as well as what they had paid for because they had been given away to other guests before my family arrived. They said that they had overbooked the rooms. WHAT?! They were told that they would be switching their rooms the next day after some guest checked out. The temporary rooms that they did get were a mess. One of the rooms had a couch that looked as if it was retrieved from a garbage dumpster and the sheets on the bed in another room had stains that appeared to be of urine! They placed another one of the rooms on the dog floor without even asking if it was ok. The next day when the rooms were suppose to be switched, the hotel then decided that they were not going to honor what they previously said they would do. After a lot of time at the registration counter and speaking with many different people, they finally switched the rooms.

The whole room situation was a catastrophe! If it wasn't for all of this, this hotel would have been ok. So if you are deciding to stay at this hotel during your time in Vegas be thorough in your requests and make sure that the room is up to par with YOUR standards!",1,1,0

At Rio, you are forced to pay $28 per day resort fee, but there are limitations despite that outrageous fee: only two devices can utilize the ""resort fee"" internet per day, only two people can utilize the gym.

I eventually had to go all the way downstairs and when I asked why they won't answer the phones I was told they have a policy that if a guest is in front of them they don't answer their phones. Well considering the line is around the damn corner basically they have a no answer phone policy. I told them that policy is crazy and how can you ignore people once they have paid for their room. It's interesting that when you call to book a room they have no problem picking up but the minute they have your money they are done with you. I won't be back to this hotel.

- Shower curtain is missing plastic piece for IN the shower- material gets wet, sticks to material decor curtain on outside and floods bathroom 
- Bathroom door off hinge and has to be slammed to shut 
- Room service is not open 24 hours 
- Room service requires you to leave your room to go downstairs and make your order
- Food is excessively expensive: $20 for 3 eggs (plus $8 for them to walk to your room)
- Absolutely NO amenities - empty fridge, no paper cups for water, room service has no ""forgotten"" items: toothpaste, qtips, etc. 
- I think the biggest insult was the ""gym"" - we were charged $40 to workout in a shoebox. I've never seen such a small gym in a hotel, including the shitty hotels you stay in for a quick overnight.

The price is definitely right and I suppose I shouldn't complain but there were a couple of things that didn't sit right with me. My room, though I didn't spend much time in it, was pretty gross. Outdated for sure, but the worst part was the smell. It smelled like an Indian food restaurant that didn't pass inspections in my hotel room. It is gag-worthy, and I did actually gag several times. I called the front desk ( all the staff are pretty okay here btw) and they said they would fix it, but they didn't do anything that made a difference. 

The gaming was pretty blah. They need more blackjack tables but they have a weird mix of games you've never heard of (wtf is wacky poker?) and baccarat. Yeah no thanks. One thing I did enjoy was that they will feed you drinks all night if you are sitting at a game, and the waitresses are definitely nice to look at. 

The food was actually pretty good and fairly cheap compared to other options. They definitely realize that you are spending a boat load of cash and they kept the food pretty reasonable. 

I might stay here again assuming the price point is consistent, but won't expect much honestly. 5\/10 meh",0,0,0

While walking through the hotel, we could tell the Rio tried to slap stuff on the walls like the Cosmopolitan.

I stayed in a room, ate at their restaurants, attended meetings in the convention center and played their table games. The only thing we didn't really do there was attend a show. 

We were in the masquerade tower which hosts their recently renovated rooms which are $15-$25 more than a standard room. Recently renovated to me means within the last year. The carpet was new, the bathroom wasn't bad but there was still a lot of 1995 in that room. The TV was a flat screen but it had a lot of lines\/receiving issues that just made it hard to watch tv. The furniture had a lot of scratches and dings, not bad but not great. We were on the 32nd floor so when the zip liners were taking off we could hear the screams too. There was also a flip flop imprint on the ceiling of our room - I'm not sure if I want to know the story behind that.

The first night we went up to the rooftop bar - VooDoo. If you haven't been, it's worth visiting the Rio just to see that view at night. There's a $10 cover but the view was worth it. There's a few bars up there too with a DJ.  They have a specialty cocktail called the Witchdoctor which is basically just rum and more rum.  It's very tasty, but dangerous.

On my second day, I was in the convention center for most of the day. The chairs were comfy, the sound systems worked, they had power strips in all of the rooms too which was convenient when the laptops started running low. The food was great for the first day, not great on the second day so overall, pretty decent place for a convention.  

We also played some roulette and then sat at a bar to play video poker.  Perhaps, we're spoiled with the casinos in Reno, but I expected the cocktail server to come around more than once per hour while we were playing roulette.  We were at the table for about three hours and were served three drinks.  After Jason won all the blue chips that he could (that was the end game after all), we decided to have a drink at the bar, throw in a few bucks in the machine and then call it a night.  Again, I might be spoiled by the Reno Casinos, but usually when we sit down at the bar to play their video games, the drinks are comped as long as you don't order anything crazy.  Apparently that was not the case at the Rio.  We sat at the machines for about an hour (long enough for me to hit four three's) and only one of our drinks was comped.  The rest we had to pay for.  

Overall, the Rio was an okay place to stay\/visit if you're planning a trip to Vegas.  They are not directly on the strip, so if you're looking for more of that experience then this isn't the place for you.  But even if you just visit to see the view from VooDoo, it's worth going out of your way for.  If my ""business meeting"" hadn't been in the hotel itself with the discounted room rates, then I probably would have stayed somewhere else.",6,2,2

The carpets were stained and ripped, the curtains were torn in a few spots and one side wouldn't operate properly. The couch was stained and had mismatched cushions. The breaker in the vanity area would trip when plugging in different items, the phone didn't work and the water pressure was lacking. The elevators were slow, as two of them were out of order so there were many people trying to use fewer elevators. It was so bad at times that lines would start forming in the hall down stairs. I waited nearly 10 minutes a handful of times just to get to my floor. The floor of two of the elevators were sticky from what I assumed was beer and was that way all four nights. The dealers were somewhat rude, and a few of them tried to short me a few times. Mostly on let it ride. I had one blackjack dealer counting with her fingers!!! This property is showing its age and management seems neglectful. Seats in the slot area were ripped and had cigarette holes. You will go thirsty waiting on a drink as well. Their restaurants are pricey for the quality. We ate off site the majority of the time. The buffet at the cosmopolitan blew our mind! It was amazing, unlike the one at the Rio.

- Handle completely missing on a glass door between the casino and the parking lot? Bellagio: Fixed immediately. The Rio: Meh, whatever.
- Eye sore of a dilapidated towel return box at the pool?
Caesar's Palace: Sanded and repainted overnight. The Rio: Meh.
- Tile falling out inside an elevator?
Pallazo: Replaced or reset. The Rio: Whatever. Tape it down.
- Ten percent of the signature blue\/red neon lights burned out on the building's now fading exterior?
- The Mirage: Refinished and replaced. The Rio: Nope.
- Vintage in-room refrigerator loud enough to keep you from sleeping....
You get the idea.

Granted, I'm aware of the price differences between 4.5-5 star resorts and The Rio, but it would be nice to feel like the place hadn't been left for dead. Also, it's not a suite if you can't make it around the bed or couch without banging into the desk or coffee table. 

On the other hand, the pool was kinda fun and there were never any crowds to navigate through in the casino. The zip-line looks fun too.

Also - the airplane style hyper-flushing toilets would be the scariest thing here, but the window-into-the-shower and toilet took that prize. When was this ever fun and sexy? Just creepy when you're traveling with your teenager.",0,0,0

I've been coming to your casino for years, but you just keep making it harder for me to find a reason.  First, you eliminate the Show in the Sky and the flair show in the village along with most of the personalities working the bar there.  Then you cut out the bevertainers after practically initiating the concept.  You've eliminated the dancers in the iBar and installed video poker machines instead.  Tonight, the Friday of the fourth of July weekend, there's not even a DJ at the iBar.  The 6 other customers and I got to watch an informercial about the 360 degree mop.  Not only that, but the 24x7x365 American Grille was closed!  I realize there have been hard times financially the last few years, but you're in the hospitality business, you need to spend money to make money.  It looks to me like you're just cutting costs, no matter what, with no consideration of what that expense  returned to the bottom line.  I'm afraid if it weren't for the friends I've made among the staff over the years, I wouldn't have any reason to come back.

When we arrived we were not pleasantly surprised by this old dude that had another agenda in mind.  One of his artists was a friend of mine and spoke highly of him and the opportunity, but little did anyone know he was just a PERVE!!

So we arrived at the Rio...Maral was so excited she stuck her body out of her huge car to capture a picture of the Prince sign on the building.  The lobby was okay, we couldn't get into the club for free, and the company outside of this douche bag was wonderful.  He wanted us to stay in his room...whatev!! 

So we got a room on our own and enjoyed it sooo much.  The room was HUGE!! and the facilities new like...and we just had a blast.  Got some liquor from a liquor store and had a wonderful party.  Made new friends, went dancing, got caught in traffic, and made new memories with the most amazing gals alive.  Thank you Connie and Maral...I love you!

On the positive side, the Rio was clean and check-in was prompt. They were also accommodating in bringing us extra blankets and towels. The pool area looked nice but we were there at the end of the season and only one of the resorts' pools was open. I could see it being a fun place to hang out in the summer.

For the negative side, it's a mile walk to the strip. There is a free shuttle that takes you to either Harrah's or Bally's but it only runs every 30 minutes or so until 12:30 a.m. The room was a decent size but being advertised as an all-suite hotel, I guess I expected more.

-24 hour deal for the buffets such as Carnival, PH, Paris, etc. 

cons-
-parking is far 
-old people casino
-bad customer service
-worse room I have ever stayed in

Experienced the worst customer service here. When we got to the room, we were disappointed to see how ""big"" the room was...which it was not that big at all being a suite & all.. It seemed like a regular hotel room. 
The air conditioner sucked ass.. we had blasted at 60 and we were still fanning ourselves and that was after we had complained and they had someone ""fix it"" by replacing the filter.. I guess you cant expect too much since the RIO is one of the oldest hotels in vegas...
The towel hangers came off... yea..surprise surprise..

the bed sheets had nasty brown spots..

the refrigerator felt like a cooler would have been a better and cooler option. 

Lastly the pull out bed looked like it has been ""pulled"" all over the place.. the mattress was completely falling apart... it was sad for my friend who had to put up with it for one night and he even hurt himself trying to pull that disgusting old thing out of the couch. 


When I complained the next day all they could do was ""send someone out for repairs""... I really was not trying to upgrade to a bigger room just a room that is not terrible... even if it is the same kind just a different room. ..and I asked the lady how long it would take because obviously this is an inconvenience for us.. she stared at me with a nasty look and replied, ""well you can stay int he room!""..-- wow what an awesome customer service you just gave me you incompetent worthless customer service representative... I mean really I just want to be comfortable and do you really expect that we can sleep and feel like we have some privacy with 3 men walking around the room and fixing things and moving the couch out and putting in a new one? really? really? okay yeah sure I would love to stay in the room and awkwardly try to ignore the three men trying to ""fix things"". 


the casino sucked as well.. its all OLD people. like old people that smell.

they offer a shuttle every 30 mins but its too bad its only good until 1 am so if you are out partying late then you either walk you ass home or pay for a cab(about $15).


overall our experience here was terrible. 

I recommend that you DO NOT plan on getting a room here.
Get the 24 hour buffet deal if you dont want to spend a lot on food.. buy it around 7 pm and you will be covered until 7 pm the next day.. so that covers your dinner, breakfast, lunch, and dinner again. Just don't stuff you face just because its a ""buffet"". We took advantage and ate at the Rio, Planet Hollywood, and almost at the Paris for crepes but we made it too late.

I also recommend bringing your own blankets.. the brown one that they give you is gross and feels like its made out of foam.. its not comfortable or soft.

We went there only to find out it wasn't open until 11am, so we decided to walk around the casino.

The check-in staff were professional and informative, and our room is large (a small suite) that has recently been updated with all new carpet, and gorgeous granite in the bath area. Brand new mattress set. No smell of smoke at all! no excess noise even though we are not far from the elevators. the windows in the suites actually have a feature that will allow you to let in some fresh air. The seated makeup vanity is a special added bonus, and made me feel like I was on vacation. The view from out room was over the swimming pools (several beautiful ones).  Off to the right is the Las Vegas Strip, and in the background an excellent panoramic view of the mountains. We hate to waste time and products, so we did not request room service until Sunday. Claudia was excellent! She was kind, professional, and her area (our room as an indicator) is SPOTLESS!!!
 (I say it again). I requested a limited service, but she quickly dusted and did a mini-full service. Her attitude was compassionate and caring. A runner also brought me some extra hangers because we are staying longer than an average stay. All of this happened within 30 minutes of my request! The staff that I have come in contact with, even in the casinos, has been warm and welcoming. They greet me and give eye contact when I walk by, and are kind when answering questions they must have hear 1000 times. When we were playing slot machines last night, a young man came up and took out drink order on an IPad and within minutes we had our beverages. We have been treated with warmth and respect. The Prime Rib at the buffet and mashed potatoes were perfectly cooked. The desserts were fun. The cost of the buffet seemed like a lot, so we just ate there one night. The breakfast restaurant in the convention area was excellent and reasonable and there are two Starbucks on site. If you are driving, I suggest you bring water as it is $3.50 a bottle unless you are gambling. I bought a water bottle that filters at the gift shop. it will pay for itself this week! The shuttle to the Other Caesar's properties took us to the strip and we spent a delightful afternoon shopping. This had truly been a memorable experience. I love watching the chickens cook on the spit over fire, and enjoyed a steak cooked on an open flame at another eatery on site (they Cook red meat perfectly at the rio). No complaints here.

The wife and I take at least one trip to Vegas each year, usually much more often but this one is the first time we've hit the Rio up in at least five years or so. (The only reason we did was this was a last minute trip and there was no room availability at Paris and Planet Hollywood, our first and second choices). I have to say, my oh my how things have changed... Some for the better, some so\/so, but unfortunately, more so for the worse.

The better, as follows:

For one, the slots seem to be much, much looser than what I remember from before. Not sure if it was just me or what, but we had never had any ""reel"" luck here, but we did pretty good this past visit. Because it ""isn't what it used to be"" (re; the bad), the casino for the most part is quite ""open"" and finding a machine or sitting at a table is not too difficult. It's ""off-strip"" so that in and of itself lends to a more ""intimate"" feel. The All American Grill will always serve you up a good steak and or seafood, (particularly rib eye and salmon). The Hotel provides a free shuttle if one has had a few refreshing beverages, wants to hit the strip casinos, (Harrah's properties of course), and avoid walking or cab fees. Works for me!!! All (and I do mean ALL), of the staff we interacted with, from those at the check-in desk, to food and beverage peeps, to folks working in the Sports-book were absolutely fantastic!!! 

The so\/so:

The rooms are nice and large for the most part. And while I've heard that many, many upgrades had been made, ours hadn't. BUT... And this is a big but, It was very clean, unlike other reviews I've read. The bed was very, very comfortable as well, however the TV was older and the picture was not very bright. (We had to close all the curtains during daylight hours to get a good, clear, viewable picture). That said, we don't spend too much time in the room anyways and it's not too big a deal, hence the so\/so comment... Parking was fine for us, (unlike some other reviewers mentioned), but we always valet so not sure how applicable that one is. Same scenario with the pools but then how many Las Vegas pools are open in mid-January anyway??? But, our previous experiences with the pool area at the Rio have always been good, again, hence the so\/so.

The Bad:

$20 Resort Fee... Really? We didn't use the spa, or the gym... Not even the Internet!!! Why not the Internet? Because when I DID try to connect, it freakin' wouldn't let me!!! $20 a day (actually $22.40 w\/tax) is just a ripoff. And that is for one device only!!! Absolute bull$hit if you ask me... But here is the kicker (and this is what bothers me most of all)... I remember when the Rio was a fairly happening casino, with lots going on and many decent restaurants to choose from. Our daughters, (when they were young ladies), always loved the ""Masquerade in the Sky"" show and looked forward to ""catching beads"" from the performers. All of the available shop space upstairs was utilized and business was, (for lack of a better term), ""booming"". What we noticed this visit was much of the shop space upstairs and downstairs was now ""available"", because many restaurants had closed. To me, without the ""Masquerade in the Sky"" show, the place almost seemed like it had been put out to pasture and it was on its last leg :-(. Too, too, bad. I had always felt that the Rio was still our ""fallback"" hotel\/casino and I'm not sure that is the case any longer.

The last word:

While overall, we had a great time, we couldn't help but feel kind of sorry for the Rio and reminisce of the good ol' days, when we were younger, full of energy, life and the Rio Hotel and Casino was too... Bottom line is after staying for years at some of the other Harrah's properties, if we had to ""re-stay"" at the Rio, would we??? The jury is still out...",11,6,6

The check in time was so complicated and long I almost wanted to check out right there and then.  There is no reason to wait twice in two different lines. Just to get a bunch of coupons and sign some more documents, that could have been handled in the line for ""screen check in"" before. 

Buttom line, if you are looking for value, and don't mind the decor or the wait. That's the place for you. I won't be staying there again, I will try to shop for rooms way in advanced and stay at a better hotel.",1,1,0

So I stayed exclusively at Harrahs properties.  But back then they were Caesars properties.... OK I'm dating myself.  Anywho, Rio was my hotel of choice.  Now lets get down to the good, the bad and the ugly.

THE GOOD:

Gambling here is amazing.  At least from a Craps girls point of view.  When I want to throw my hard earned money away with little to no chance of ever getting it back here is where I want to do it.  Its lively and exciting, and once you get at a good table that drink lady is there ever 5 minutes.  Me being the lush I am, I never turned her down.  Which led to me having 3 drinks at once.  Oh the good times.  

The rooms..... OK, here is the trick to the rooms.  If you want a newly remodeled room stay in the new towers.  The decor is nice but the rooms are small.  Me personally Id rather have a larger room then new decor.  But to each their own.  In Vegas I need all the room I can get to throw my stuff around.  The rooms in the Masquerade a HUGE.  But, beware.... Some of the rooms have a window into the shower.  I didn't notice until I was taking a shower and saw my son. I felt violated.  lol.  Also, if you ever get the chance stay in a Masquerade Suite.  AMAZING.  Dining room, living room, picture windows, great view......  I miss this place already.

The amenities... The Buffet, Voodoo Lounge, The Pool.  All great.


THE BAD:

Location.  The major drawback is that the Rio is off the strip.  But thanks to cabs this is an obstacle you can overcome.  So deal with it, your wallet will thank you.

THE UGLY:

OK maybe I jumped the gun with The Ugly, but it rolled right off my thumbs.

The suite was big, webtv rocks, the mini-bar went empty and it was a party once I started spilling drinks on the sectional couch. Sorry.

Overlooking the pools 26 stories up with no chance of jumping as all the windows are sealed. Piped in air sucks.

The gaming is decent and the floor is large! The restaurants serve good food, especially the RubBBQ! The bars are easy to get a seat at and the bartenders are cool. Best thing are the little platforms around the casino in which the cocktail waitresses either dance or sing on every 15 minutes or so and their scantilly clad outfits are great!

They still have the glutfest buffet, which is the only reason to come, if you are willing to fork over $45 bucks. But no more dancers, no more flair, and no more double or nothing.

A hotel employee was handing out bottled water to people in line which was a nice for people who needed or wanted them.

The room was very large and comfortable. The bed was a little bouncy and not that firm but ok. There's a coffee pot in the room but no complimentary coffee.

It must be purchased from the in room service refrigerator which automatically charges when items are removed .

The wall paper in the bathroom was peeling next to the sink at the baseboards and the wood borders needed paint.  The room had no walk in shower and only a old style tub with a SHOWER CURTAIN..Really? Everything was clean and no visible mold

Around one of windows was masking tape on the border of the window, not sure if it was to seal an air leak or if it was used to mask when painting, it had paint over spray on it. It had been there for a long time.

The air conditioning worked very well and had a updated digital control.

The gaming floor is large and the hotel is busy on Friday afternoon. I did notice there are a lot more dollar machines then in the past. Not a fan of dollar machines.

There were two things that are very annoying on the gaming floor. They have a company on the gaming floor set up to sell time shares. It's  very annoying, they have set up numerous areas staffed with well dressed individuals who bother people and target couples.

They solicit personal information and you enter a drawing for a new Corvette. They hand out a coupon for a ""FREE"" two day cruise on the east coast. But it's up to you to get there first , at your cost.

It's all TIME SHARE so beware.!!
It's all TIME SHARE DID I SAY THAT!!!
I DONT CARE IF THEY GIVE ME FIVE GALLONS OF FREE BEER ON THE CRUISE,  I'M NOT SITTING THROUGH A ONE ON ONE SALES PITCH WITH A YELLOW TOOTHED HYPED SALES PERSON PRESSURING ME TO PURCHASE A FRIGGEN TIME SHARE.........HELP!!!!!!!

If I wanted a time share I would of purchased one in the 90's and would of been using it and not vacationing at the RIO.....please no time shares it's annoying and a thing of the past ......TACKY! !

On the second level next to Burger King is a cosmetic business . The employee's stand at the doorway and bother people. They hand out decorative bags that contain skin lotion products,  this is to get you to stop. They then use every tactic to engage you in a conversation to discuss your grooming standards as it relates to skin care products. There trying to get you in the store to solicit products. They will actually  say        "" LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING INSIDE ""
Really??....if I wanted skin care products I would be at the mall......please!!

They have one Starbucks set up on a very small scale kind of hidden next to a set of elevators The employees are working as fast as they can!!.  Extremely long lines, my wife waited 35 minutes in line just to order two coffees. This was on Saturday morning at 10 am.......they need more Starbucks like other casinos set up in various locations in the casino

There are a lot of food options , we ordered from a walk up deli and the line was short, but the wait was just terrible. The order receiver at the cash register was just plain slow and confused. We ordered well done french fries and they were barely cooked, we ordered a cobb salad but it was more like a chef salad.
After ordering it was another long wait to receive the order. They had also forgot to give my wife a drink cup while ordering, she thought it was at the fountain machine which it was not and had to stand in line again to get the cup that WASN'T given to her the first time......ANNOYING and INCOMPETENT EMPLOYEES.   
In the past the hotel had entertainment in the sky with decorative lively entertainers flying around on a ceiling mounted track above the gaming floor , I didn't see any of this on Friday nite. The hotel was just not as lively and boaring. 

The cocktail waitresses were very attentive and very personable and just didn't walk by and yell ""DRINKS""
they would actually stop next to you and engage in conversation. 

FIVE DAY PRIOR RESERVATION ON RIOS WEB PAGE.
TOTAL FOR ONE DAY INCLUDING RESORT FEES WAS $163.00  NCLUDING TAXES....DON'T FORGET ABOUT RESORT FEES WHEN YOU BOOK THEY ADD UP DAILY.....

I called Maintenence three times to no avail, and finally went down to the front desk to speak with a manager myself. The customer service rep, Joanna, was rude and unhelpful. She told me I would just have to sleep in the cold. The manager, William, said it was a hotel-wide problem, with no heat in any rooms. For $350\/night that is unacceptable. He said he couldn't move me to any other room and offered me $30 for the inconvenience. $30?.... A credit for my stay would be more suitable.

What can I say, I need my space and it was the only all-suites hotel.  Granted it was off the strip (which is why you can really find some bargain price at certain times of the year), but the free shuttle bus which takes you to Harrah's ( and now Caesars and Bally's) is convenient and saves you the hassle of having to find parking.  

Now that I have so many hotels to choose from for free, I don't stay at the Rio as much.  And with the other hotels updating their rooms to ultra modern with cool shower fixtures, Rio's room just seems so..........unattractive.  

Maybe I am spoiled now and I can no longer stand the water-saving shower head at the Rio.  To make matters worse, it ran out of hot water (it was only lukewarm) by the time I woke up at noon!  I practically shivered the whole time I was in the shower!  What the heck!  How can a hotel run out of hot water???  Then the other time, I woke up to the sound of dripping water!  Holly crap!

The first time we got to stay at a Masquerade Suite.  The suite was very roomy and had floor to ceiling windows with a wonderful view of the Strip.  Access to the Strip was pretty easy since it had a shuttle that took you to Harrah's and back.  And food-wise, both the Carnival World Buffet and Village Seafood Buffet were good enough to satisfy our hungry stomachs.  I also enjoyed the festive atmosphere in the Masquerade casino area.  It was a great experience.

Fast forward to 2017 the experience was just slightly underwhelming, but still okay for the most part.  This time we stayed in a Classic Suite so the room was much smaller.  Didn't matter too much to me though since I pretty much was only there to rest and sleep.  Amazingly, parking is still free in their self-parking garage.  Since I had a rental car, that was a huuuuuge convenience for me.  The Village Seafood Buffet was no longer a separate buffet and had been absorbed into the Carnival World Buffet.  The downside was that it was only open for dinner only.  Because I had made dinner plans for other places around Vegas, I didn't have time to check out the buffet.

Where do they think we gonna spend money if checked-early...in the gambling tables or slot machines...Within the Rio!!!
Instead of services getting better, it's just about how much it could squeeze money out of its patrons!!!
I think this might be my last time I'm staying @Rio!!!
I do expect to lose in gambling but other hotels does it better without making u feel like a piece of meat they could tear into!!! For example, one time I was able to check into Cosmopolitan @8am without them charging early check-in fee!!! Same goes for MGM or Mandalay Bay hotels!!! By checking-in early I lost more money within the hotel I checked into since I was there longer!!!
I have no problems with the rest of services in Rio...but I do wish it would change regarding the early check-in policy because plane does not always follow the exact check-in time!!!",1,0,0

For a conference, it was fine. I spent a lot of time displaying my companies product in the convention area.

The good: lots of good restaurants inside, the Penn and Teller show, the gigantic suite (I paced it off, it must be 20x20), room furnishing and decor, the vibe of the outside pool areas (pretty and relaxing during the day.)

I enjoyed a free trip (on a vendor) to the Voodoo Lounge, Rooftop - Great views at sunset, free drinks and food on the vendor, that was ""sweet"".

The bad: 

I'm a ""young"" 49 - i was hoping to see a lot of of young folks whooping it up in the casino and going crazy. The casino seemed to be filled with folks my age and older grinding out nickels and dimes against the dealers. Maybe that was an artifact of the conference I was at.

For some reason, the place seems dated to me (exterior, casino area) although the rooms were decent. 

The check-in process was a nightmare. When my boss got there he had to wait like 20 minutes to get in. ""Priority card"" holders have their own line. 

Its off the strip - the free shuttle bus to the strip was appreciated, but I always seemed to be riding with a bunch of blue haired seniors from Iron River, WI, or wherever.  I suppose I could have cabbed, but all that riding made me wish I stayed on the strip.",1,1,0

The room itself is nice.  An empty mini fridge is provided for each room.  We save a lot of money by buying some water bottles and snacks.  They have in room internet but it is not wireless.  We had a great view of the pool and strip.

The off strip location can be a good or bad thing.  They do offer shuttle service to Bally's, Paris, and Harrah's around every 30 minutes.  And I mean 20-30 minutes.  I would have wished they had more shuttles operating more frequently, especially since the World Series of Poker was taking place.  However, if you have a car you're good.

Restaurants: Not the best selection.  If you're looking for fine dining, don't eat here.  Although I did like Gaylord India and the wine cellar.  Shopping is not that great here either.

Pool: Loved it.  The crowd was not annoying like they are at some of the pools on the strip.  Also, if you're not a Rio guest but sign up for the total rewards card you can use the pool for free.

Conclusion; bankruptcy seems more real. Yesterday, I attempted to order a bottle of wine from room service. The recording said room service is closed between 1-4.

Ok...no $80 for a $25 bottle for me.

Today, ordered breakfast. A lovely woman, who has worked here 25 years delivered a paper bag with $65 worth of crummy food on paper plates. She was embarrassed, said their policy changed in the Summer. Said it might be time to retire.

From a business trip perspective, this place was major fail.

I was here for a conference, related to internet commerce. Hey, guess what didn't work? Give up? 'K, I'll tell you.  Internet. 

The people at the check-in counter were happy to announce that the hotel had recently upgraded to wifi. Recently? This should have been done a long time ago, not last week. See my last review from two years ago, regarding no internet.

If it wants to host conferences, the Rio needs to be able to support the conference's needs.  I was refunded the $14\/day internet access fee, as were most other conference-goers who complained I'm sure, but it cost the guests much more than that. It cost them their business, as virtual meetings and skype calls, and even simple activities like checking email, could not be done. 

And for $200\/night to stay there? No. 

There remain two redeeming features of the Rio.

* Gaylord's Indian restaurant. Completely decent Indian food at completely decent prices, in a well-appointed space. Totally overlooked and underappreciated by most Rio guests as they surge  frantically towards the All-Murkin bar and grill.  And because so few people dine there, they don't have the staff to handle moderate traffic from the all-murkin bar and grill spillover at lunchtime. Poor guys. I say to them: Sal Si Puedes.

* The second feature is the free shuttle, because it takes you *away* from the Rio. SAL SI PUEDES!",2,4,2

Price-wise, got a heckuva good deal for stay from Sept 1 - 5 --  $29 for each of the first four nights and $99 for the last night (a Friday).  Not bad!  Their website did state there was a $13 per night resort fee which -- according to the website --  included wi-fi, pools and workout room.  That was OK with us, given the good price we got on the room and we did use the wi-fi every night before going to sleep.  But we used ONLY the wi-fi, not the other offerings. (More on this below...)   The room itself was good, not great.  Big room, comfy bed, and we really liked the floor-to-ceiling windows.   We didn't have any cleanliness issues as some previous posters mentioned, and our room was cleaned daily.    Front desk staff was nice at check-in (see below for my check-out story), and we got lucky with valet service and didn't have to wait long for either drop-off or pick-up the entire week.

NOW the downside. 

First, if you're on a budget, get your meals somewhere else.  The restaurants are outrageously priced -- at the All-American Bar and Grill, burgers and one beer each for two for $50?  Seriously??    Yeah, I could have gone to Burger King upstairs for cheap burgers, but who the hell wants to eat that in Vegas??  None of the few other on-site places were any better price-wise and as a result, we didn't eat at the Rio after that so I can't review the other places. 

Second,  go elsewhere to play slots.  The machines at the Rio were extremely  tight the entire week.    I realize that slots anywhere are pretty much a losing proposition, but most places have machines that pay back a little to keep you interested. Not the Rio.  Not once did I hear anyone yell or whoop over a big win, and all the discussion I heard while walking the floor was how ridiculous it was that no one was winning even a small amount. 

Third, and most important --- DO NOT USE QUICK CHECKOUT !!!  GO TO THE FRONT DESK TO CHECK OUT because you might find -- as did I -- that there may be a significant increase in what they intend to charge you.  When I went to check out, they tried to charge me $25 per night resort fees, saying that the original $13 was ""only for Wi-Fi"".    I stated that their website said only $13 per night, and the clerk started arguing with me.  When I explained to her that I used only wi-fi during our stay and should be charged only $13 anyway, she insisted that I was lying to her.  I then pulled out my tablet, went to their website and SHOWED HER on their website where it said $13 -- no mention of $24.99.    Even then, she said, ""Well, you should have told check-in that you were going to use only wi-fi.""    I replied with the point that their website AND the person who took my phone reservation both stated that resort fees were $13 per night.   It's not like this was just $2 or $3 we were talking about -- it was $60.   

After all that, she got rude and huffy, yanked my room keycards from my hand, and started pounding away on the keyboard.   She then came back with a figure that was still way over what it should have been.  When I asked about THAT, she loudly exhaled and said ""Your rate was $49 per night Monday through Thursday and $129 for Friday.""   I said, ""Uh, no,"" and produced a printout of the reservation emailed to me after I placed my reservation over the phone.     She again got exasperated, took the paper from my hand, and said ""Well, I guess I have to give it to you at that rate.""   By now, I was starting to get upset and replied, 'Yeah, I guess you do.""  Oh, she did not like that.  It was as if I was taking the money directly from her pocket.  Finally, after nearly 20 minutes at the counter, I paid the rate I HAD BEEN QUOTED, she printed the receipt, slapped it on the counter and said, ""Here.""   No ""thank you"", no ""sorry for any confusion,""  nothing.  I contemplated asking for a supervisor, but my wife tugged at my shirt and said, ""Let's just go. There are other places to stay next time.""   And she was right.  

We go to Vegas at least once a year for a golf vacation, and despite the good rate I was quoted and finally ended up paying after persistence,  I don't think the Rio will be on our list of places to stay again.  The other things -- high prices at restaurants and tight slots -- I can overlook those.  After all, there are other places in Vegas to eat and gamble.  What I can NOT overlook is the fact that they tried to stick me for  nearly an additional $170 above the quote I got on the phone.   Maybe the clerk was having a bad day...  I'd be willing to cut her some slack if that was the case or there was some error in tabulating my stay. But when she got rude with me, my benevolence went out the window.     I was polite with her through the entire discussion, getting a bit flippant ONLY when she reluctantly  told me that she was  charging me what I was quoted.    My only regret is that I wish I had taken the time to get her name.",2,1,0

Maybe my expectations of the Rio are outdated, just like their room decor. Seriously, avoid the Masquerade Towers... at least the 19th floor, unless you're craving extreme nostalgia from the early 90's. Sparsely decorated room, hideous drapes, worn out couch, CRT TV, and a toilet that moves when you sit on it. Totally misrepresented by the pictures on their website. I'll give it its size though, but really the rest of it made me not want to be in the room that much. Plus for having an empty fridge for personal items. Majority table limits were $10 minimum too, even in the mornings. Maybe check out Gold Coast next door if you're looking for cheaper tables.

Rooms -  Stayed in a studio suite in the Ipanema tower.  Overall, the room was very spacious and attractive.  The rooms in this tower seem to have been upgraded so all the fixtures and furniture were all modern looking.  As everyone else said, their were a few things, chipped tiles in the bathroom, a faint smell of smoke coming through the vents...however, we enjoyed our stay in the room.  I say, if you can, stay in the Ipanema tower.

Casino - We were here the during the week, Tue - Fri so things were pretty quite.  This casino is my Stepdad's favorite since Harrah's likes to comp him handsomely for his play.  In fact, we didn't have to pay for any of the room or lodging on this trip.  All of the tables seem to be 10 min.  They should think about changing them to $5 since they are not a strip hotel.  When leaving on Friday, more people were coming in and the casino did liven up.  However, the casino itself is small compared to other Vegas casinos.  All in all, I had fun playing the Quick Hit penny slots and won about $200.

Pool -  Awesome pool for the kids...not sure how good it is for adults, not a whole lot of action in way of pool party fun but then again, we weren't there on the weekend.  Also, from the pool is where you can tell how deteriorated the façade of the hotel has become.  A few concerns, there were drink cups all over the ""sandy"" part of the pool.  A dirty diaper on the stoop under the water fall, however, after mentioning it to the staff, these things were taken care of but in my opinion, these things should have been caught before the pool opened. 

Food - The American Bar and Grill is the best place to eat in the casino, hands down.  Solid steaks and prime rib.  Great burgers...their BBQ wings are the bomb.  The buffet doesn't look like it is the gem it used to be.  So my recommendation is to eat at the American Bar and Grill...sure it is a little pricey but if you are up late playing in the casino, it is your only bet and the staff at the bar are really, really friendly.

Shuttle - They do have a shuttle that drops you off at either Bally's \/ Paris or Harrah's.  Do Harrah's as it is in the middle of the strip and not the beginning where Bally's is.  The shuttles run every 30 minutes, give or take.

All in all, we had a great time at the Rio.  I don't know if the bad reviews (dirty rooms) stem from the Masquerade tower...also, the staff at the Rio were very nice and accommodating.  I would recommend this the Rio to my friends and I would stay again

coming into this place via one of the parking garages, I thought I was really going to hate it, because there is definitely a ""game show"" and ""carnival cruise"" vibe to the one end of the casino - loud & obnoxious were the words that came to me; but on further exploration, it's not so bad; first off, the property is huge, and there's another part of the casino that is more my speed, especially the hottie dealers, waitresses, and go-go girls in the center; has a very nice & lively sports book, with a decent deli\/grill adjacent for chow; affordable shopping on the floor above the casino level; a lot of mid-level bachelorette parties roaming about, probably due to the Chippendales show; really liked the classy vibe at the Wine Cellar & Tasting Room, but sadly it was pretty empty; best craft beer bet = the restaurants & bars have pretty standard\/boring fare, but thankfully, there is a sundries store & a liquor store on premesis, both with a worthy selection of craft bottles to go; overall, probably worthy of 3.5 stars, but just can't give it 4",2,0,0

If the exact same property were located directly on the strip, I think I would consider returning.  But since it's located off strip and the property is in need of a fresh coat of paint and some serious Sin City cool-factor rebranding, I wouldn't stay here again. Customer service here is decent, other than the long lines for check-in\/out. The rooms are nice, all suites, which was the selling point for me for booking there. Housekeeping seemed a little confused about what towels were required in room. One day we had towels and bathmat, but no washcloth, and another we had washcloths, but no bath mat. 
I'm not a big gambler, and the casino felt a little sad (although to be fair I think all casinos seem a little sad). The cocktail waitresses may don the trashiest and skimpiest waitressing outfits in Vegas, and it felt contrived and pathetic when the loud drumming starts up every 15 minutes one of said cocktail waitresses has to get on a stage and dance for her life. I did appreciate that whenever I sat down to gamble for more than a couple minutes, a server would come by to take my drink order. Other than the buffets, the restaurants are pretty scarce including a forlorn and grungy McFadden's. The four pools (including one private topless pool) were rather nice, and offered great people watching.

We had an epic room and the trip started out with me and a coworker and a local friend who showed up. We wound up going clubbing at the Beach and Rain and other spots, but that's another story. :)

This hotel was great, we were up on the upper most floors and as this is an all suite hotel we had an Epic view of Las Vegas as well as a kitchen, giant tub, couch, great TV and a stereo in the room. At the time, one of the nicest suite hotels and our room had just been redone. Service was excellent. The staff was great.

Yeah, well Rio is the Las Vegas hotel equivalent of that.

It's not on The Strip, the decor is tired, but how can you argue their prices for a full suite? The rooms here are gigantic and comfortable to lounge in without feeling like you're just chilling in a bedroom. Speaking of beds, theirs are incredibly comfortable (or maybe I'm just enjoying not having dog paws in my back all night long, ha!).

All the usual suspects manifest on the casino floor with fair table minimums, unlike some of the bigger guys on the strip. $15 blackjack hands are completely feasible. My beef with Rio's casino is their self-serving policy of single deck rules while dealing from a six deck shoe. As if the house didn't already have the advantage!

Speaking of bending over the hotel guests, I paid $3.85 for a 12 ounce Pepsi in their gift shop this morning. Jeeeeeeez.

Please streamline your valet, Rio. It's a fantastic complimentary perk to offer, however the wait to have your car retrieved is generally ten minutes. I can only imagine that a huge resort like this could implement more creative ways to provide better service in this one area. Allow guests to scan their valet ticket to your valet desk on their way down from the room? There's got to be a better mouse trap.

Usually my wife and I stay on the strip or Fremont Street but we have a baby on the way so we decided to do this Vegas trip on a bit of a budget ($30.00\/night on Kayak.com) .Both of us have been coming to Vegas for over 10 years and have experienced many types of hotels, dining, and entertainment here. 

We arrived right around check-in time. We got lucky in the sense that only about 5 people were in front of us waiting to check in but we still waited almost 30 minutes to get to the front desk despite the fact that there were four or 5 agents checking people in. While we were waiting the line to check in grew to twenty plus waiting to check in and I started to feel glad that we arrived when we did. During check in we were informed that there was a $20,00\/night ""resort fee"". So much for getting the room for 30 bucks a night. If we had not already paid through kayak.com we probably would have went somewhere else for 50 a night. 

The resort fee also included 2 complimentary entries into the gym. The gym is located in the spa so I guess if you go more than twice you have to pay. We were there three days so I used it twice. Also included in the resort fee was internet service. You still have to ""pay"" a charge of $13.95 when you connect but it gets comp'd when you check out. Of course they don't tell you this so the first time you try to use it you are left wondering how it works and have to call the front desk to ask why you are being charged when the internet is included in the resort fee. Seems it would be much easier to either explain how it works at check in or place an instruction sheet in the room. Either way my wife and I bot have smart phones and rarely need a laptop while traveling so it would be nice to have the option of purchasing the internet or not instead of having it included in a resort fee.

Our room was located high on the 37th floor which we thought would be great since it is away from the noise of everything. We were sadly mistaken. Turns out the rooftop nightclub is only 5 floors above us. We got in a little after midnight the fist night and could hear bass reverberating throughout the room. We could clearly hear partying going on as well. We called the front desk to ask what time the club closed and were told 2 am. 2 am comes.... the club does not close. It finally stopped around 3:30 am. We complained the next day and were told that the club pretty much shuts down whenever people leave. There were apparently no similar room s to move us into they let us upgrade to a 1600 sq ft suite for an additional $60.00 a night. Our $100.00 original lodging cost on kayak.com has now turned into $300.00 after the cost to upgrade and pay for the resort fee.

The Rio has lots of pools which is nice and several hot tubs. One of the pools even features and artificial beach which was nice. One thing that really drew us to the Rio was that they featured an adults only (21 and up) pool area with cabanas and reserved round sofa type areas. We were first disappointed to learn that the adults only pool area was closed Tuesday and Wednesday (two of the three days we were there). We went on Thursday planning to rent a cabana for what we figured would be an hourly charge only to find out that they are free but have a $250.00 bar minimum for the cabanas and a $100.00 minimum for the sofas. A little steep I think for the quality of hotel the Rio is. I would have paid 50 for an hour  but you would have to stay all day at the pool to rack up $250 bucks in drinks. We ended up just using the regular lounge chairs which were much nicer that the non-adult side. The adult pool was nice and large and there were two hot tubs as well. One thing I noticed about the Rio is that they are big on go-go dancers. You see them throughout the hotel and we also saw them at the adult pool. Kind of interesting but a little strange as well to have them out at the pool.

We came and went a lot since we drove and the hotel is just off the strip. One thing that really threw me off this place is that unless you are a seven star member of some sort the valet will not bring your car around when you are getting ready to leave. You must go down to the valet wait in line to give the valet guy your ticket then wait for you car to come around. My wife is 8 months pregnant so we ask the valet and front desk for an exception and they wouldn't budge. I have never stayed at a hotel anywhere that you could not call and have your car brought around when you were leaving.

Our stay included 2 complimentary breakfast buffets. We used them but the buffet was noting write home about. Needless to say, it was a free breakfast, but If you are paying, go somewhere else. It definitely is not worth the $30.00 bucks or so that they charge regularly.

Overall, I would only recommend this hotel if you could find no other suitable accommodations for similar price and if you spend most of the time away from the hotel.",1,0,0

Used to stay at Rio a lot as I had a friend there, she would always get me great rates for amazing rooms. She has since moved on. I stayed at Rio for a week in September. It was not remarkable but it was okay. Not a great view or anything but who goes to Vegas to sit in front of a hotel window in awe of the view? September, had a great room ""which I paid a premium for"" service was just okay, even at the pool, restaurants, etc. Last week booked another room at Rio, 1 night, I was only up for 1 day handling business. I booked a King. When I went to check in, the girl at the desk, (don't remember her name but she was from Gulf Port) was not pleasant at all. She ran my card for ""resort fee"", no problem. Then ran it a second time for ""incidentals"" and told me my card was declined which I knew wasn't possible. I called them, waited the ten minutes for my call to be answered. They told me a fraud hold had been placed automatically but that they would lift the hold, give it a few more minutes and run it again. After a few minutes, the condescending girl swiped the card what seemed like few times, told me again it was declined. Not wanting to go through 15 more minutes on the phone, I used a different card. This one worked. Attitude of the girl behind the counter had gotten pretty bad. O. way to the rokm, stopped at one of the shops and used same card she said declined to buy drinks and snacks. It worked fine. (more later)
In September I stayed in Masquerade tower, this time they had me in Ipanema. The place was wrecked. The hallway was lined with wall lamps, the shades on every one of them had been bashed in. Carpet was dingy and the whole floor smelled musty.
Got to the room and it was two Queen sized beds. I had reserved a King single, not a Queen double. I called to the desk and they informed me that even though I had reserved a King, they didn't have any more Kings in that room size so they just gave me a Queen instead. Thanks for letting me know down at the counter or even offering me any other option since what I had reserved ( the whole reason you RESERVE something is so that the will reserve or hold it for you) was not available because they had in fact not reserved it for me. They offered me a $30 food and beverage credit to be used at the Rio. It was already after midnight and my first stop in the morning was at 8am. Thanks but that isn't compensation that benefits me. I let them know this and they offered to refund my resort fee, it was pretty much the same amount. I opted for that option, thanked them and dealt with the Queen sized bed.
I was up and out in the morning. Finished my business and drove back home. When I got home, I called the credit card company to see why it was working fine for me but had been declined at Rio. They informed me that the first time it was swiped, it had multiple holds placed on it simultaneously so a fraud hold was automatically placed on the card. After the security hold was lifted and she ran the card again, the $200 charge which is supposed to be a hold for ""incidentals"" WAS charged to the card even though the nasty girl behind the counter said the card was declined. Flash forward to 11 days after my stay at the Rio. I go online to check both credit cards. the first $200 charge that Ms. Nasty said didn't go through is still on that card as is the charge for the resort fee. The $200 charge on the other card, the second one that was for incidentals was lifted. So now, I have to call Rio, spend who knows how long on the phone with them to explain all of this so that they can credit my card back. Why, why does all of this fall on the guest? Was this something I didn't do right? NO, it is something Rio didn't do right.
Now that we are done with my most recent visit and hotel room. A bit more about Rio. The Rio used to be one of the great places to go. The clubs were great, buffets were notoriously wonderful, pool area was a hopping hot spot and the show they had with the floats hanging from the cieling, live performers and music and hospitality,  hospitality,  hospitality. Every one was happy, up and friendly. The Rio had a great energy and I really enjoyed going there and would spend a lot of time there even if I wasn't staying there. All of that now seems to be gone. No more show at all. The clubs in my opinion are lacking and where there used to be long lines to get into the clubs, I don't see them anymore which shows that there are many others who share my opinion. Buffets are okay but not like they used to be. Now being at the Rio, it feels like they just do the bare minimum to stay up and running. I actually makes me sad. I have stayed at the Rio here and there in the past few years after my friend moved on. Where I used to go to the Rio all the time when I was in Vegas (which is fairly often) unless I am staying there, I don't go there. It is pretty sad.",0,0,0

Some of what I mention you'll see noted in other reviews.
 
Check-in:  We arrived at 4:30 PM and avoided the long lines by going to one of the express kiosk stations.  We had trouble with the scanner but a nice young man came over and scanned my driver's license for me.  I don't know what the trick was but this guy was able to get the machine to work.  However, the screen told us our room wasn't ready.  It gave us an option to be emailed when it was but we have cheap phones without the capability of receiving email unless we're connected to Wi-Fi.
 
We decided to leave our bags with the bell captain outside the hotel and then went to eat at one of the hotel restaurants. The American Bar and Grill (see my review of that). 
 
At a little after 6:00 PM we returned to the kiosk and needed the young man's help again to scan my driver's license.  This time our room was ready and the machine gave us two room card keys. 
 
The Room:  Our room on the 9th floor of the Masquerade Tower was spacious.  It had two queen beds as requested and a view of the mountains.  It had a small table with two chairs, a large L-shaped couch and glass coffee table, and a vanity area outside the bathroom with a mini fridge.  The closet had a safe large enough for our lap top and tablets, and documents.  It also had a 40 inch LCD TV.
 
The bathroom had another vanity.
 
Comments:  I am a retired property manager.  I am used to doing inspections and spotting things that need attention or repair.  I don't expect perfection though.  There are things I'm willing to over look that other people get upset about in their reviews.  I'll just note the things that were significant to us.
 
1) The pillows are like bricks.  We're used to that and each bring a feather pillow from home that can compress in a suitcase and then later be ""refluffed"" to full size.  I had read from previous reviews that you could request softer pillows, which I did.  They were brought to our room within minutes of my request.
 
2) Mini-fridge.  It was fine, but after storing a partially consumed bottle of Coke in it, it became a ""slushy"" as the soda began to freeze.
 
3) The Screaming Toilet - They have some kind of ultra pressure power toilet that made a loud noise each time you flushed it.  There's no way you could use the toilet while someone else was sleeping and not disturb them.  As you know, it's a Federal Law that anyone over 50 must get up 1-3 times a night and use the bathroom.  Failure to do so will result in mandatory wearing of Depends for a period of not less than 15 consecutive months.
 
4) Really? A window in the shower?  Yes folks, they had a pretty mirror type framed wall picture that had a small clear window between the main room and the shower.  Besides the freak factor of being able to see into the shower while someone else uses it, it was also a conduit for the bright lights of the bathroom.  When I used the bathroom after my wife fell asleep I had to bring a small flashlight with me so I didn't wake her turning on the light.  I also had to refrain from flushing the toilet until the morning - see item 3.
 
5) The security bar on the entry door was broken.  I called to the desk to request it be fixed but it wasn't.

6) We asked for an extra soap and within 5 minutes they brought up a bag with soap and shampoo.

7) Room had a nice view of the mountains. Saw a spectacular sunset of pinks and blues.

8) Food at the American Bar & Grill was good (shrimp dinner) but expensive.

9) Breakfast at Hash A Go Go mediocre and pricey.  Try Blondies at the Miracle Mile Shops - same breakfast for $3.95.

10) Shuttle to sister hotels often had a 45 minute wait.

11) Our eyes burned from smoke walking through the casino in the afternoon or evening.

12) Slot payoffs didn't happen often enough to reinforce staying on machine.  I don't mind losing if it's fun along the way.  When you lose $5 to $10 on a penny slot with no payoffs it's not fun.

13) Check out was easy - I did it via the television.",5,1,0

This is not the Rio De Janerio, it's  the Rio Hotel and Casino! One of the well known hotels in Las Vegas, and kind of distant from the main strip. Well, at least not walking distance. 

I was on a mission to find a hotel close to my friend's MMA event and the Rio was the closest hotel. I was able to get a great deal on a travel website and booked my room right away.  Upon the day of my arrival, the check-in  was very easy. I came in at a non-peak time. As a hotel guest waiting in line to check, a staff member of the hotel handed us bottled water and coupons for the attractions within the hotel's partners.

The pros for the room are that it's very spacious and had great view of the strip. The room was thoroughly cleaned before I even checked in. My biggest gripe I had about the hotel was not having cell phone service to save my life! With the $20+ resort fee I had to pay at least included WiFi. My service provider is Sprint.

The checkout was as easy for  me as checking in. I checked out from my hotel room to be on my merry way to the airport. I would stay at the Rio again, but this time I would have rented a car.

Your rooms are lovely at first glance, but there are problems when we look deeper. There was a broken towel bar in our master bath. We had to call maitenance to fix the ac (just like we did last year in the same room). My pillows were constantly stabbing my face with their errant feathers. And please don't get me going on the lack of internet. I have stayed in a lot of hotels and never have I experienced such spotty internet service. 

The restaurants are a-ok, but you took away my favorite mexican, replaced with a dud BBQ and bow that has closed. This and the former Italian place both remain empty. 

The shops are crappy. I won't hold it against you that you only have Pepsi and no Coke, but even the snacks suck, and there is no real shopping to speak of. It would be nice to get a couple cute things, or some good souveniers, but even this is impossible. 

I will say I like the pool. Chairs are nice, snackbar food is good and there are actually pools at different temps for your preferrence. 

Service is good pretty much everywhere in the casino, but I think this is really a Vegas thing that continues everywhere. But special props to Patricia who cleaned our room almost everyday for many weeks and knew us all by name. She was really sweet. 

All I can say Rio is that you are lucky that you host the WSOP.",1,2,0

I took my very valid complaints to the front desk at checkout, well unless you are a platinum or higher total rewards member forget it!!!!  My friends had less valid complaints and because they are platinum they were pretty much compt for their entire stay as well as getting a limo ride to the airport. We tried to use the fitness center and were told it is 12.50 if you aren't paying resort fees which I was because it's manditory for Gold level members. The whole experience was very demeaning they continued to make us feel like we were not as important as our fellow travelers from check in where we couldn't have rooms close to each other again no platinum level or higher. They did however take off $88 for our trouble. Wow I didn't expect to get my whole stay free but they didn't even care! Crazy since I actually paid for our room and lost alot of money there.

Conference area:
The distance from my room to the conference room was at least a mile. I thought I was doing a half marathon. I was looking for people passing out Gatorade. I really didn't have to go to the gym my whole stay in Vegas. Be sure to bring gym shoes.

The food that was available in the conference room was delicious. Breakfast was hearty, and lunch was basically dinner because the portions were so huge. There was a lot of choices so you weren't bored. Con for having good food was getting so sleepy after the meal, and trying to stay awake during the 2nd half of the conference.

Casino:
My stay at the Rio was on a weekday, so it wasn't packed. A variety of tables and slots to choose from. I  didn't gamble much at the Rio. I went to the strip for that. Free Shuttles to the casinos that are under the same company as the Rio was nice.


The room was nice. I just wish they got rid of some outdated features. Had an old CRT TV, but who has time to watch tv while in vegas? No wifi in the rooms. Had to use an Ethernet cable. There was wireless in the conference area though.

I came here for a business trip for a conference in their conference center.  My bad experience started a couple months before my trip when I booked the rooms for my colleague and myself.  The hotel would not take a pre-authorized card.  This is something I do with EVERY hotel I stay at for business.  I do not get the company card for the actual trip so this is a must.  They let me know I can do a pre-payment.  Fine, done.

On the day I arrive, I go to check-in.  It's was pretty easy and fast but as I give them my name, they tell me they need a card for incidentals.  Fine, this is normal.  I give my bank card and the lady then informs me she is going to take out 400 dollars!!  Excuse me? What for?  For incidentals I'm informed and because my bank card is not a ""credit"" card.   Again, this is something that has never happened to me at any other hotel in Vegas - or any I've gone on for business.  I argue that I'm not even going to be in my room and not going to order anything to the room or use the fridge.  She then lowers what she will take out to $200.  I'm still annoyed because even though I'm getting that credited back when I check out - it will take 3-5 business days to post to my bank account.  Strike two.

The next morning I take a shower before the conference and it's luke warm.  I deal with it but pretty annoyed. 

I then pick up our packages for the show at the Business Center - the lady says to me ""$10"".  Excuse me? For what?  ""For holding the package.  We charge by ounce""  How cheap are you Rio?  Looking to make a dollar off of me in ANY way?  What kind of service is this that you are providing for your guests?!  Especially since this conference is bringing you A LOT of money!  Strike 3

Last day of the conference, I take a shower before my first morning meetings and the water is FREEZING!  Strike 4!!  Seriously what am I paying $160 a night for???!!

Overall, this is my worst experience ever at a hotel in Vegas, and it's so far off the strip why would you even think of staying here??  160 dollars is definitely not worth it!  The place overwhelming smells like smoke, is horribly cheesy and loud, cold showers, mediocre rooms and so far off the strip.  You can find a MUCH better deal in Vegas.  Colleagues in the industry who also attended the conference stayed at Mandalay for $75 a night - much nicer than the Rio.

DON'T STAY HERE!!!!!  Unless you want to waste $160 a night - plus where ever else they can get money from you!",4,3,2

However, this hotel is showing it's age, I never really had a problem with this place, but I am slowly noticing that this place is quickly aging and it is not being kept up well. Each room has a flat screen tv and a refrigerator. There are two room towers, the Masquerade Tower is less crowded with foot traffic and closer to their large parking garage, our favorite. The Impanema Tower is the middle of the casino floor and has more foot traffic. The rooms need to be cleaned better, the towels and linens need to be seriously replaced, the restrooms need to be modernized, and the carnival buffet, well, it is not very good anymore, not worth the price. The food is cold and you can tell that there is no pride in making it. The dessert section is very limited, doesn't offer any good desserts.

1) No toiletries in the room upon check-in.   The blow dryer was broke.   We requested both but the hair dryer never arrived.  One face cloth for use.   Coffee machine broke and no pods in the mini bar even if it had worked. (The Starbucks line was insane - and surprisingly they were the only ones not jacking up their prices.)  No cups anywhere in the room.  Sigh.  

2) The smokiest, nastiest smelling casino.   You reek like you have been to a dive bar after your stay.....everything, clothes, luggages, etc.

3) Not a cocktail waitress in sight.   Tried the bar but it was over-crowded because of the none existent cocktail staff.

4) They charge absorbent prices on absolutely everything.   The resort fee was almost as much as the room.   The sandwich at the deli cost as much as the buffet.   A bag of chips in the convenience shop is $6.99!    One solidary drink will cost $20 or more.   There is a cover charge on everything even if you are staying at the hotel.

5) Gambling here sucked.   There is a gloomy pallor over the whole place because no one is winning.   No one.  Somehow they figured out how to take the joy out of the one thing that you are supposed to be there for.

6) The pool is beyond sad.   They charge you to reserve chairs but there are no chairs to be found so you wind up pissing someone off because they get booted from their chair.   The pool water is murky.  The grounds are a bit filthy. There is entirely too many children at this casino.    The pool waitress did not acknowledge us even though we were being charged a minimum to sit by the pool.   Had to order our drinks and food at the bar and then were being asked to tip the waitress who wouldn't even glance our way.  (There was a cabana of boys she was very much taken with)   We finally found a manager to compliment the security guard who felt sorry for all us smucks and tried to help get menus, etc.   Really sad.   Plus the whole scene was brought down by the honeymoon couple trying to decide which drink they could afford to share.   BEWARE.....drinks are $21 and up.

7) Once again, what's up with all these kids breathing in the nasty casino air and watching the X rocks dancers.   Sad, sad.....this is no place for children.   Find a flipping sitter.   This is only couple with the other sad fact that there are few young people staying here.   There is simply no attraction anymore.   Sad stage that sits in the dark.   None of the past glory.   The only place you will find a crowd is at the taxi\/shuttle stand where people are trying to get the heck out of there!

8)  Buffet prices are not worth it.   Go across the street or take a shuttle.   They rob you at the restaurants.

I leave you with what the tax driver told me.   They daily shuttle in people from the local old age homes and hospices.   They are not even trying to appeal to the locals anymore.   They just forgot how to run a business and are greedy for money.

The room itself was spacious and comfortable enough. But to get to it you had to walk through a smoke-filled, windowless casino that was depressing and gross. There isn't really a lobby, it's just the casino floor in front of the registration table. From what I saw, there were no benches outdoors. So, it was hard to escape the smoky, mostly windowless pit of despair.  There aren't any neighboring coffee shops (other than in casinos) or cute stores or anything to walk to. And -- at least in November -- there's no open pool.

Seeing parents holding a small child's hand walking through a casino filled with smoke and with waitresses wearing next to nothing was especially sad. 

There was also some ridiculousness related to multiple broken elevators. And my non-smoking room smelled like smoke. And had a weird, creepy window from the shower\/bathroom to the bedroom. 

While the rooms might be cheap, they gouge you in other ways. There's a coffee pot in the room (a Keuring one), but no coffee. For that, you have to pay room service $8 or you can pay a minimum of about $3.50 at the Starbucks downstairs. 

There was an Indian restaurant that was pretty good and had labeled vegan options, but the reasonable-ish prices stopped being reasonable once I found out that rice cost extra. A minimum of $9 extra (!!). 

I suppose if casinos are your thing, you would probably not have the same reaction as I did. 

But come on. At a day and age when Reynolds American is even banning smoking in most parts of its office, forcing one's customers and staff to be subjected to indoor smoking is just nasty. My throat is still scratchy from the trip.",0,0,0

We arrived late at night for our checkin only to find out the specific room we paid for was not available(we wanted a king bed\/non smoking). Fortunately the staff eventually upgraded us to a suite for the night, ironically it had two full beds and was smoking.  But at this point we just wanted to go to bed. Throughout our stay we often noticed that only half the elevators were in service which created large annoying backups in the main lobby and even longer waits when trying to go to from your room. Also the checkin\/ checkout line was almost always backed up, possibly because the ""express checkin\/out"" didn't work. On our last day unfortunately my fiancé was a bit under the weather, unsure if from the water(will go into detail) in the hotel or the food from the hotels steakhouse the night prior. We had a very late flight home so I requested management to allow us an delayed checkout, they would only extend by 3 hours, so 2 pm. Keep in mind our first night we didn't even get our room until after 10 pm. 
The most frustrating issue however was being informed by a note on the table in our second room that the water in the hotel is contaminated and it was recommended we not drink it. Not only were we NOT informed when we first arrived but when we inquired with concierge about what we should do, they merely offered to sell us bottled water.

I pulled up to the front - waited, waited, looked and looked. There was NO ONE to come get my bags or car.  Yes, it was 5:00 pm on Sunday which is one of their busiest days, but no staff to greet guests.  I went inside to check in counter and said there was no one outside, they then called the bell dept and had someone show up.  When I said I was checking in and handed them my keys they said I had to go to the valet parking spot, drove there and they said oh no, you have to park in the check in lot - which was around the building!  So far, bad impression. No longer can you pull up to a hotel to check in.  You have to park 3\/4 miles away.  No doorman to greet you. I ended up carrying my own bags.

Check in clerk was pleasant, but my ""guaranteed"" room was not available.  After asking her to check again - 3 times, finally a king bed room appeared.  I was not told a thing about the hotel, no map, nothing - just room keys. I went over to Total Rewards to get my card, and given a little more info.

Room was clean, spacious and nicely decorated but smelled like bacon.  The housekeeper was super nice and called and had someone come up to spray the room, adjust the temperature in the refrigerator. They all came promptly.  I did notice each day when I returned to the room it smelled like food.  I asked the engineer who came in to adjust the brightness on the TV about it and he said I was above the ventilation fans for a restaurant below.  I was on the 9th floor. It wasn't bad or I would have asked to move. I felt there was something missing from my room - no hotel directory. I called and asked about it, front desk knew nothing about it and I never got one.  Odd, nothing which lists what is here, what hours they are open and what they offer. 

The internet is horrible! the connection time is around 5 minutes and I kept having to login whenever my computer went to sleep, I left with my computer and came back, or changed browsers. 

My biggest disapointment is the Masquerade in the Sky is NO LONGER HERE!!! That is the main reason I made my reservation here :(  Also, the buffet is very expensive.  I seem to remember $14.95 for lunch - it is now $21.95 if you are a total rewards, and dinner is $29.95.  (there is a groupon avail now for dinner,  2 for price of 1) the seafood buffet dinner is $49.95!  Good grief! The buffet looked nice, but it encourages people to eat way more than they should just to get their money's worth.  No wonder America is obese!

There is a Vietnamese restaurant which wasn't too expensive, kind of fast food like , prices were around $12.95, The sports cafe was next to it with prices starting at $8.95, but you can buy a piece of pizza for $4.95.

One of the best things about this place was the spa. Very nicely laid out, perfect amenities and very clean. Use is included with the day use fee. Unfortunately it closes at 7:00 PM. The fitness center is located here. My day use fee was supposed to be $22.00 but appears as $24.60 on my bill - I guess they tax it?

The casino is nothing special, lots of penny slots if you like those. Smoking is allowed in this casino and very noticeable.  All in all, the best things that were here are no longer what make it the best. It is very noticeable that they have cut down on staff.  Vegas is still busy no matter when you come here, I don't get it!

Pool area is nice but the hours are very limited. It closes at 6:00 PM. Not sure if they have longer hours in the spring and summer, but for March it seemed pretty limited. When I went out there none of the bars or eating places were open. again, staff cutbacks. 

The Starbucks in the hallway on the way to the Ipanema Tower elevators is always open and very busy! Happy hour special: from 10:00PM to 11:00 PM all pastries are $2.00! They have two Starbucks here for your coffee fix. They do have Keurig coffee makers in the rooms,  so if you have a Keurig, bring your coffee pods with you because they don't seem to be available to purchase, or they are $8.00 for 3 (supposed to be in the in-room bar, but mine didn't have any)

I passed a few other restaurants that weren't open so don't know if it was the hour I went by or if they just weren't open. 

TV channel selection was pretty bad, very limited channels.

Compared to some of the newer hotel casinos, this place isn't that big. Which can be a plus. You only have to walk 3\/4 mile to get to your car instead of 1 1\/2! Felt isolated from the strip - it isn't walking distance, and the shuttles they have only run every 30 minutes. I wouldn't stay here again unless I was coming to a convention in this hotel.

Twice a year I go to a Safety Convention run by our insurance company. Our group has grown steadily. 10 years ago we were the 7th company to join, today there are 200 companies. Being so big, we need a big place. This years venue the Rio Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. 

It's a big hotel, able to accommodate a group like ours (about 150 participants). Our group was the small one. Another group had over 1,000 participants. Yikes. 

The Room:
800 sq ft in area. The beds were comfortable. Bathroom was clean. Living area had a sofa and a work desk. Flat screen TV, mini bar, refrigerator, safe, hair dryer,  iron & ironing board were the amenities they had in the room. All in all, a nice place to relax after a long day of work. 

The Convention:
Big rooms to accommodate us. 
We had breakfast and lunch catered by the hotel. The food was good, but nothing special. 
It is a long long walk to get to the convention area from the hotel.

The Rio has quite a few of them. 
They have 2 buffets. The famous Carnival buffet and the Seafood buffet. I've tried both and they are both very good.

Martorano's is an Italian restaurant. We had our group dinner here and food was great. It's served family style so it good for a group. 

They also have a dim sum (KJ Chinese Dim Sum), Indian (Royal India Bistro), seafood (Buzios), breakfast (Hash House A Go Go) & steak (Voo Doo Steak House) restaurants inside the Rio. 

The Casino
All the casino games you expect. They also have a sports book area to bet on games. 

The Rio is off the Strip. They offer 2 free shuttles to their sister casinos on the Strip. One goes to Bally's and the other one goes to Harrah's. There is a return shuttle from both of those casino back to the Rio. It operates every half hour. 

I really enjoyed my time here. 
The convention space was huge. 
The room are nice and clean. 
The restaurant inside the hotel were a plenty. 
The casino area was vibrant and fun. 
A Las Vegas experience indeed.",33,16,20

I have stayed at many different properties in many different states. My Rio experience just seemed like every corner that could be cut to save money was taken. No microwave or coffee maker in the room. The toilet paper was horrible. Just feels really cheap at every turn. Total rewards $s earned are worth 50%. Hash house a gogo breakfast cost me $60+. I will never return to this property,0,0,0

Yes, you can go topless, but that's not why I liked it. I liked it because I find it disturbing that people bring their children to casino\/hotels which then forces me to be surrounded by the little buggers. 

Look, kids are great but they do NOT belong in a Vegas casino. It's filled with smoke, assholes like me are swearing and drinking and generally being obnoxious, and let's not forget about the half naked servers. Yea, that's exactly what your 10 year old child should be exposed to...asshats.

Anyway, I digress. The pool area was perfect. My pals and I spent a large amount of time lounging in the hot tubs and enjoying the waterfalls in the adult section. 

The hotel itself is off the main drag and it's a hot hike over the expressway to get to where the action is. Luckily one of my hotelmates rented a car, so it was easier for us to get around. They did require a credit card at check in to pay for the room up front, which I found very odd. The food offerings are decent but not amazing. The gambling action is standard. The rooms are clean and spacious but there isn't much of a view from many of the rooms. We also had a hell of a time getting any towels delivered on a Saturday. We called 3 times over the course of 2 hours and never saw any. (Boo to that!) 

Overall, it's a nice place, but I'd rather be on main strip next time.",3,5,2

We paid an extra $20 a night and upgraded to a higher room with a view of the strip.  We could see the strip at a distance but the view was still beautiful at night when all the lights came on.  There was traffic noise and some train noise.  There were minor imperfections with the room but nothing I could really complain about.  Be aware that there are sensors in the mini bar in their rooms.  All you have to do is touch or pickup an item and they will bill you for it at $8.25 each.  If you see refreshment charges on your bill then by all means tell them and they will remove the charges.  Also check everything over as our package included two free 24 hour Buffet of Buffet tickets and they didn't seem to be aware of it when we checked in.  The manager didn't help at all until my husband called the agent and they then faxed over the necessary information.  We were told to go buy our buffet tickets and they would comp us for the cost.  When we checked out it appeared they forgot to do this.  More hastle but we did get it straightened out as we were checking out.  We had looked forward to seeing Penn and Teller but unfortunately they weren't there the week we went.  Also the free entertainment other than a few strolling singers were closed down.  Avoid McFaddens if you want to drink as their prices are high and their drinks are terrible.  One good thing was the free shuttle to either Harrahs or Ballys.  My husband had planned to gamble a little but he studied the odds and said that he had never seen them so tight in his whole life.  Also we miss the days of gingling coins and flashing lights.  Everything is silent except for the music.  Oh well all things change I suppose.  I doubt we will return.,0,0,0

Had a large amount of money stolen from my roof safe bc hotel maintenance opened it for someone who called from the room whose name was not on the room!  Meaning they opened the safe for a random person without checking ID.  Now, instead of trying to accept liability they are doing everything to cover their asses.  They refuse do divulge any information about what happened and was only able to find out specific information shout when the safe was opened and how from someone who would only talk off the record.  Now if that's not enough.... After spending 5 hours filing out incident reports with the police and the casino I demanded to get a room for the weekend comped (I was due to check out that morning). After initially refusing by claiming they were full they finally relented and found a room but still initially tried to charge for the room.  I point blank told them I was not going to spend another dime there.  The front desk lady told me she thought she could get it comped through a casino host and would let me know the next morning if she couldn't and went ahead and booked the room, again I explicitly told her to let me know if I was going to have to pay bc I would go somewhere else if that was the case.  Don't hear anything the next morning so call the front desk about the status of my room, I am told a new room is ready and when I ask if there are any charges showing for the new nights he says no. 

So I check in on Friday being told that I have rooms for the weekend.  When I get back to my room early Sunday morning I call the front desk to make sure they aren't morons and booked me through Monday morning as all I ever was told was I was booked for the weekend.  Sure enough Sunday is apparently not considered a weekend to these people.  I explain the situation on the phone and am told someone will call me about it in the morning.  Obviously nobody calls the next morning and I just leave bc I was supposed to meet up with friends anyway.  Somehow things still get worse.  I check my email that night to find the copy of a bill sent from the Rio for those 2 nights.  Yep they charged me over $250 despite being explicitly told multiple times that it would be comped, that I would be notified if it wasn't going to be comped.  So I call this morning and have to listen to 2 different people blather about their comp policy, not knowing this particular situation at all, was finally told the front desk manager would call me when she gets in tonight.  Guess what?  Waited to 11 pm and shockingly nobody called!!  So I call again, finally get in touch with a manager, and am told the money will be refunded if my story can be corroborated by the front desk manager.  So we will see if they manage to screw this up as well.  Long story short, this property is filled with thieves, scumbags, liars, and gross incompetence.  I will probably be fighting a long battle to get the money back which they essentially stole from me due to their own negligence, not to mention fraudulent room charges on top of that.

I was researching prices and resort fees, parking fees, etc for our  trip to Las Vegas. It was our first trip there and I was a little overwhelmed at all the hotels, prices, resort fees, etc. I found a great deal with Allegiantair.com for our hotel, flight and rental car. Finding the hotel was not hard, but trying to park and check in was crazy for us! We parked where we thought we should but as we got out a valet screamed at us to move. I was very upset, we had just flew in from our delayed flight, we were tired, hungry and this is Vegas?? Let's go home, is what I was thinking.
A different Valet came over to help us, he was so nice and helped us with where to go and where to park. My husband went to check in while I sat in the car. 
When he came back he was not sure where to park to get to our room. We circled around for a while trying to figure it out and had to go back to the Valet area where the same nice young man helped us out. He renewed my spirit that night! We finally found out where to park and then tried to find our room! Ugg, small town folk, it is hard! We were so lost, my husband left again to find someone to help us. It was kind of a maze for us. I was overly tired and started crying like a cranky toddler. He came back, we found our room and went to sleep. 
This hotel is rather old, but our room was clean, and honestly, we didn't spend a lot of time in here so as long as it was clean and quiet, I was happy. If you want a really upscale room, this hotel will be satisfy you. But if yo are on a budget and just need a place to crash, this is your hotel! If we didn't have a rental car I would not have wanted to stay here because the strip is long enough to walk without having to walk to the hotel afterwards.
We had a great time in Las Vegas and the Rio was an economical choice for us. No resort or parking fees which can rack up! There is a fee for wi-fi but we jsut used our phones for everything.
Seafood buffet was a let down. We heard amazing things about it and decided to spend the money (expensive) , we were disappointed. Of course, we come from the coast where we have amazing seafood, so this was not up to par in the least. I would not recommend it. Everything else was good.

The good:
Spacious rooms


Casino has all the games you dream of playing

Sportsbook is a good size and lines move quickly

Sportsbook Deli is a great place to have a quick bite and watch the games

The bad:
They have a new web check in.  Doesn't work.  I listed a 3 p.m. check in and was supposed to be notified when room was ready.  I didn't get the notice until 5 p.m. AFTER I checked into the hotel.

Front desk staff is slow.  Long lines and they just talk to each other in the back and make people wait to check in.  This has happened several times to me while checking in.


The restaurant selection is okay, not up to the standards of the hotels on the strip

Since the hotel is away from the strip.  You'll have to cab or take the shuttle to the strip

Overall:
I would typically have given this place 4 stars, but because of the lack of customer service and their new web check in hasn't been debugged yet rolled out to the public, I would have to take away 2 stars.

The rooms and casino are good.  Some of the places to eat are decent, but definitely needs a face lift.  The downside is the staff.  Not very welcoming and they like to talk to each other rather than the guests.  It's a good place to stay if you have more than 2 adults and need more square footage than your average hotel room.

Where is an apology and an ""I'm sorry sir... we set high standards and clearly we are missing the mark today. I'd like to personally check another suite and have your items moved there once I check it out.""

Do they not teach people this in hotel executive courses? Is there a market for certification courses in hotel management? It sure appears the Rio staff needs refresher training.

Sadly, people will continue to go here because it is cheap and people are looking to save a $. You are the people I am warning... you don't save anything by going to this dump.

It was a bit of a last minute impulse road trip, and man, I really love them. I wish I'd do more random stuff like that. It was one of the best weekends I've had in awhile.

The Rio is pretty much what you'd expect in Vegas: gaudy, cacophonous, ostentatious, ad infinitum. I knew it the second we walked in the door and saw the huge Chippendales sign as we were bombarded with the all-too-familiar jingle jangle sounds of the slot machines. Awesome.

We didn't really mull around the casino all that much, as I'm not big into gambling, and we got there with only a couple of hours to spare before the party we came up to attend. That said, if I were a gambling man, I'd bet that there's more than enough to sate your risk-taking desires.

The suite was spacious; plenty of room for two couples. We had a nice view of the strip, and it was quiet; a complete contrast from the endless stir of activity downstairs.

The beds were comfortable, the bathroom was adequate, and we had more than enough room to lounge around. I will say that we could have used more pillows, and in this day and age of HD, I expected more from the TV.

After one crazy, laser-light filled evening of intemperance followed by a few hours of tossing and turning (i.e., a failed attempt at sleep), we ordered room service the next day, and it was OK. R and I shared an omelette of some sort, and the four of us shared a carafe of coffee. After a brief respite, we said our goodbyes and went on our way.

I am left with one lingering question: Is it just me, or is the walk out of a Vegas hotel pretty much always rougher than the walk in?",9,9,8

Also, the casino is pretty far off the strip.  They have a shuttle to a couple of other casinos, but it stops at 4 or 1 am, depending on the night, so we ended up having to take taxis back to the hotel.

The food on site is a bit expensive but the portions justify the price (the same can not be said for places on the strip). They have shuttles going to strip but dont count on them as they rotate about every 30min and generally require you to wait a full cycle due to the amount of people going. Cab fare is $5-$10 to get to the strip.

The rooms are nice and big, its worth it to upgrade to the suite view if they extend you a special offer (I got it for $10 extra a night). The TV quality is crap but you're in Vegas, don't spend it watching TV!

The food is expensive, expect to pay near $15-$20 a person without alcoholic drinks. Unlike other places I went to (notably Caesars) their portions are on par with the pay. Don't expect to get out cheaper, taxis to anywhere else will end up costing more. I had no issues eating at their sports deli almost exclusively during the convention. I actually sort of miss some of the sandwiches they make.

The casino is pretty good. They have a decent assortment of games and a poker room that consistently plays $1\/$3 NL holdem and $60-$80 NL tournaments. There was a full table at 11:00am on a Monday so its fairly active.

It's not on the strip, it's across the highway. So you can walk 1.5 -2 miles to be on the very north end of the strip, or take a taxi for 10 bucks.

We got a great rate through a third party booking service, and only had to pay resort fees upon check in. The check in line gets long, but the self service machine works well and they pulled a few of us out of line into the VIP Registration area to expedite the process.

This was surprising as every hotel I've stayed at in the past few years have offered that. Apart from that, the rooms did look like they could use a refresh and be brightened up, which I'm sure will happen in the next few years or so. 

As I mentioned earlier, I would stay at the Rio for a longer trip. The Rio is located about a mile off the strip behind Caesar's Palace, which also owns Harrah's. There is free shuttle to the strip via Harrah's running every 30 minutes (make sure you get a player's card - this is your ""ticket"" to ride). My family were able to ride every time we lined up, although the line gets long. For a two or three night trip, I'd stay on the strip just to make the most of my time in Vegas without worrying about making it back to Harrah's in time to wait in line for a shuttle.

~The Good~
Rio is off of the main part of the strip, so  it has a feel of being its own animal, I guess you could say. I haven't eaten at any of the restaurants, but the variety of options is perfect, from Caribbean fare to fine seafood, then they have this fun looking Indian food place as we walked in...Best of many worlds if you ask me. Gambling hall looks spacious and spread out evenly, and the events center which we saw Penn & Teller at was large, had a Starbucks for those coffee lovers, and a large lobby for all patrons with a bar. They have some drink stations as well, like Last Call for those whom like the slushy drinks. I was not in for very long, but I love island-themed resorts, so this place looks slick and worth a try again.

~The Bad~
I did notice that the pool was small, looked extremely small, actually. So I must have been seeing a side pool, I am sure....otherwise that is the smallest damn pool, why would a Caribbean-themed casino have a rinky-dink pool? Hrmm... The parking lot was also crazy; the structure had no room for our car, which forced us to park in the overflow lot.  I did not mind walking, but it was annoying having to drive around to an overflow lot... Also, the place did not smell overly inviting, not sure if it was the cigarette smoke or the cigarette smoke... Blech.  Also, just as it is off the strip which is nice, it is also difficult getting to all the other action. It would be difficult for me to have to drive to the strip each time I want to go down there, a lot of work.

~The Down low~
Overall, this place is fun. I was not able to enjoy it and take the entire place in on my trip there, mainly because we had the show to catch. Next time in Vegas, I will try to venture back and view more the casino has to offer. I will try to verify the pool situation, and see if parking ever gets better...until then they will get a generic 3 stars...But that should change :-0",0,0,0

Located on Flamingo Road a few minutes west of the Las Vegas Strip, Rio is a decent hotel. What they lack, in terms of the quality of the hotel, they make up for with the size of their rooms and service.

Quality of the Hotel: 3\/5
It's not as nice as some of the hotels on the Strip, but their rooms are comfortable. Everything is easy to access, and you don't have to walk around too much to get anywhere.

Rooms: 4\/5 stars
For the price, the rooms are pretty big. It was just me and my friend staying there, but we could've had several more people stay in our room more comfortably.

Service: 5\/5 Stars
-The front desk were quick to take care of people checking in and out, so we didn't have to wait awhile. They were really accommodating.
-When we ordered items to be brought up from the housekeeping staff, they came within 10 minutes, which is pretty fast in my experience with Vegas hotels.

Pool: 4\/5 Stars

The room (suite)  was very large,  at least 500 square ft. It had a large sectional couch,  fridge, sitting chair and vanity.  The bed was very comfy.  I got this room for $29 ($55) after tax so it was a good deal for the money.  Chippendales is here in this hotel along with Eddie Griffin and the Penn brothers (magic show) from what I remember. There is also a zipline that was heavily promoted and a great skyview and Club.  The pool area is awesome, it has 3 jacuzzis and 3 pools from what I saw.

My husband and I stayed here over Memorial weekend. I knew it was going to be a busy weekend so I purchased reservations for 2 lounge chairs at the Voo Pool, $28 each, for Saturday. We checked in with the pool staff and we were taken to the chairs I had reserved. It was only 11:30 and there was hardly anyone there yet. So we waited a few minutes and a waitress never came over to us to get drink orders so my husband just got up and went to the bar. While my husband was doing that, the waitress finally came over. Before even indroducing herself she says ""ummm did you pay for these?"" And said ""yes, for these 2."" She then says ""so, you gave one of the guys over there money for these??"" And I said ""no. I purchased them online. But I already checked in with one of the guys up there"". She then says ""oh. Well what can I get for you"". I told her my husband had already went to the bar but I'm sure we will be needed refills soon. She then walks away.
After awhile, we were ready to order more drinks. She never came up to us. I had to flag her down.  Thought the day, she paid attention to EVERYONE around us, but completely ignored us! During lunch time, everyone had menus, but us. The girl next to me had to tell the waitress to bring me a menu! I could understand if this was a crazy pool party that was super crowded, but it wasn't. She completely went out of her way to ignore us. 
My husband and I are really good tippers since I used to be a waitress...so this chick blew it! We only tipped her $8.00 on a $120 check. And that is something we NEVER do, so you know it had to be bad! In the future, we will not be going to this pool.",2,1,0

There were holes in the walls. The hot water in the bathroom didn't work. I had to take a cold shower at 130 am. The shower head was awful because water was spraying everywhere but my body. The tub shower tap was barely on. If I would've pushed on it, it would have fallen off the wall. 

We called to let them know about all the problems, they did offer to send someone to fix the hot water problem. But at 130am I was just done with the Rio and wanted to go to sleep. The damage was done and nothing could have rectified the stay at that point.

You'll be walking through the dry, hot desert on a huge road filled with lots of exhaust. If you're staying here, expect to be driving to the strip. 
The only benefit to staying off the strip is if you're looking for a more quiet, less busy experience. The Rio is definitely ""less busy"" than other casinos, but it's definitely not quiet. 
The parking garage is a far walk from the hotel rooms (you'll be stuck walking through the smokey casino) just to get to your room. Parking here is still free, but you'll have to end up paying for parking every time you drive to the strip. 
The rooms were clean, spacious and acceptable. Our bathroom had the mildew-y wet towel smell that just never went away.

Overall, the Rio was just OK (2.5 - 3 stars depending on location.)  Our experience:
Bar Areas - 2 stars
* The Irish Pub At The Rio - shuttered closed (none of the staff were aware of this!)
* IBAR - loud and obnoxious music and too many videos.
* VooDoo Rooftop Nightclub - should have gone here, but it was too early.
* Masquerade Bar - It was the best of the rest, but seating was limited and table service was non-existent.  So, we opted to get a frozen drink from a stand by the entrance and check out the place.

Village All Seafood Buffet - 2 stars
It has many rave reviews, but it smelled fishy and was $48\/person.  We opted for the main buffet.

Carnival World Buffet:  
Food - 4 stars
There were many food choices from the very basic to the fairly stylish.  The quality was higher than other buffets I've seen.  And, the food was mostly tasty.

Experience - 2 stars
For $39\/person, it should have been a much better experience.  The wait was ridiculously long.  The seating and ""service"" were totally absurd.

Therefore, they agents do not have accurate details on the room types. When I called to book the room, not even a supervisor could tell me the difference between the different suites and towers in the hotel. So I booked blind, and took what they called a Visa promotional package with two queen beds and a ""mountain view"".  I got a breakdown of the rate per night when I was looking on the website but didn't get it when I got my confirmation, just a total price, which I paid in advance. I had to change our check in date, and the website would not let me make the change online. I called 3 times, and was placed on hold for an hour total. A supervisor named Dora promised to call me back to make the change and to tell me the difference in the room types. That call never came. I called back and after being on hold for another 40 minutes, I was able to make the change in my check in dates. The reservation process was frustrating and the staff had no concept of good customer service. 

This was a foreshadowing of what was to come. The hotel looks lovely from the outside. But once you walk in, it's a different story. You're bombarded with smoke from the casino, which is right as you walk in. The morning of check in, We got an email asking us to check in online to avoid long lines. When we arrived, we were directed to a kiosk that printed out our keys. The first room had a foul smell, filthy sofa, and the only view was of a rooftop and air conditioning units. I immediately went to the front desk and asked for a room change. I waited on line for over 20 minutes. The front desk clerk said I shouldn't have used the kiosk to check in and gave me keys to a different room. This was the Ipanema Tower. When we entered the second room, we were hit with a huge wave of air freshener. After a minute, the freshener dissipated  and our eyes started burning. Then the overwhelming smell of cigarette smoke filled the room. The sofa  was also filthy, smelly had cigarette burns on the cushions. This was supposed to be a non-smoking room. Platform beds with hard mattresses and lumpy, flat pillows. Decor was dingy, dated.  There is a window from the bedroom to the shower giving no privacy when showering. 

I returned again to the front desk. After another 25 minute wait, I got keys to a third room. I decided to check the room out before dragging our luggage to it. The pillow cases were soiled and there was a thick, white substance in it that appeared to be semen. Back down to front desk. This time I asked for a supervisor. As I was waiting, I overheard the woman speaking with the supervisor about a window washer who she caught peeping into her room. The supervisor, Cheree Johnson, argued with the woman saying the man could not have been peeping into the room. The woman said his face was actually pressed up against the glass and there was no doubt he was looking in. 

 After a very long wait, Ms. Johnson offered to ""upgrade"" our room. We were not offered any assistance with our luggage, which we had to drag through the casino to an entirely different tower. This ""upgraded room"" had a lopsided bed,  pillows that were lumpy and flat, that were worse that what you'd find in a Motel 6.  The room had only one lamp for an entire 600 foot room and our ""view"" was of a  burned out pile of rubble of what had been an Outback Steakouse. 

I called down to the front desk and supervisor Jose said he would issue a refund if we did not want to stay. So I booked another hotel on this promise for which I had to prepay, since it was after 4pm. When I went to the front desk to get our refund, another supervisor, Cheree Johnson, refused to issue the refund. She gave a multitude of excuses from she could not resell the room to she didn't know what our nightly room rate was. She refused to honor what the previous supervisor promised and charged us over $366 for the night, even though we didn't stay the night. This was more than double any advertised rate for that room for any night including weekends. She was punitive, argumentative and has no idea how to provide even an acceptable level of customer service. 

More warnings: The ""resort fee"", which is separate from the room rate includes a very slow basic internet connection for ONLY TWO DEVICES. So if you and your partner have phones and either a computer or tablet you plan to use, you will be charged an additional $14.95 PER DEVICE. There is NO wifi access in public areas such as the lobby, pool, restaurants, bars etc. There is no coffee maker in the rooms. You must be 21+ to even walk through the hotel, so if you have kids, they cannot be on their own even to go to the pool.

We left and stayed at the South Point Hotel, which had comparable sized rooms with coffee makers, better furnishings, better amenities for better prices. I would not recommend this hotel and would stay at a roadside motel before ever staying at the Rio.",9,2,0

As soon as I walked in it smelled bad like mold, and who knows what. There were holes on the sofa, damaged furniture, my jacuzzi didn't work, and it seemed like the room was not cleaned. There were small pieces of potato chips on the floor. 

I would think that before a guest arrives they would test and check to make sure things work. I would also think they would clean the place. For this being a VIP room and for the pricey tag I expect everything to work and be cleaned before my arrival. Having a repair guy working on the tub when I'm trying to enjoy my room and privacy is not nice. 

Honestly it seems like they don't care and just want you to stay and collect your money. Make it right Rio clean your rooms, fix your furniture and use some candles or something for that smell. One of my friends stayed at the Gold Coast next door and I was surprised on how clean it was and how nice the rooms are. I'm not sure if they just remodeled but sad to say I booked in the wrong hotel.",3,2,0

I went downstairs, grabbed something to eat, went to a few talks, and went back to my room at 5 to find the shower was still not working.

I've stayed several times at the Rio over the last couple years and I'll have to say that my recent stay (May 2017) wasn't up to par. 

First of all the room..they put me on the 39th ""VIP Floor""..room was large but the layout was extremely odd..the TV wasn't even facing the bed and it was actually IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM...on it's own stand...blocking the gorgeous mountain view from the bed. I do appreciate the larger ""suite"" size of the rooms and it's very cheap to stay here compared to other properties. I am a Total Rewards Member and usually get a comp for the Rio as well, which is a perk even if you don't play THAT MUCH.

My other complaint is how they changed the business hours of many of the restaurants...this is Las Vegas! It shouldn't be difficult to find food...but dining options here are severely limited during the early morning hours and late night (when food is NEEDED! Lol). I got some free buffet passes which was nice, but the buffet wasn't open until 4pm (I stayed on weekdays). At night, they only had the sports bar deli open.

Additionally...the free shuttle service that runs from the Rio to the Strip used to be great but it seems as if they cut back on the number of rides. Everytime I rode the shuttle, they ended up leaving more than half the people back. I believe it runs every 30 minutes now (opposed to 15 minutes like before). I ended up taking Uber more...as waiting for the shuttle then having to literally fight people to hop on wasn't worth my time.

I'm giving it two stars because of past experiences over the years and I actually do pretty well at the tables (BLACK 17 and RED 23 on the roulette wheels baby!) when I play here. Can't tell if they just given up on this place or not. In past reviews, I have recommended this as a nice relaxed spot to stay at but I was actually a bit bummed this time around!

They nickel and dime you. They charge for the gym $22, for the internet $13+, per day, but while I was there the convention goers got free access. Wohoo.  I had the Keurig Coffee maker and there were two k cups near the coffee maker but I didn't want to touch them based on people's review of being charged for them so I just used my own. What ever happened to free coffee in pouches???

There is an empty fridge for you to store your food and booze. 

2. On the other hand there isn't a resort fee.  

3. The free show Masquerade didn't play when I was staying which I thought was crazy because there was a CONVENTION going on in the hotel.  I thought it was a shame and made the whole place seem less lively.... 

4.The pool was closed.  Why?  Do people forget to swim when it is winter?  Who cares, heat up that sucker and leave the jacuzzi on.  Again, I felt the Rio was very dull because there was zero excitement going on.

5 The free shuttle that sorta runs every half hour, but only runs to Ballys and Harrahs and ONLY runs from 10am to 1am.  Why not 24 hours?  It is Vegas after all.  

6. Cost from the airport to the hotel in a taxi was 15 ish so I used the shuttle for like $7. However, they told me that in order to use the shuttle to go to the airport, I had too leave 3 hours earlier.  WHATEVER.

I had a super clean room with a great view.  The room looked like it was stuck in the 70s, but still trendy in the minimalist sense. The shower was hot and had good water pressure.  I liked the smell of their soap, lotion, and shampoo, but they only had a shampoo\/conditioner combo.  You've been warned.    

Their tables were sorta expensive.  I just wanted to play super small hands.   Lowest cost tables were $5 with $10 buy in, I think.  BOO.  

If you sign up for the Rewards Card and you have a hotel room, they give you $5 on the spot to blow on the slot machines.  Wohoo, won $30.  

They also teach you the basics of poker, no strategy or hierarchy, just a feel for the game.  I guess few people sign up because they taught me on the spot which I think is great customer service from the Poker Room.  

The check in line is horrific.  It took 40 minutes to get through even though I checked in at 5pm to avoid the 4pm check in people.  AH!  

Unlike a lot of other reviewers I happened to go when there were no promotions going on so I paid full price for my stay and I didn't get a chance to purchase any of the Rio's packages.  I did bring this up to management, but they didn't budge.  I think that was also poor customer service because I ended up buying tickets to another show at another hotel AND I ended up liking the other hotel more, so I plan to stay there next time I come to vegas.

Even though I have stayed up and down the Strip, this is still one of my favorites! The rooms are HUGE and easily fit 4-5 people. The rooms do differ by towers, but they always seem to have 2 queen beds and a huge sofa and lots of walking around space. Floor to ceiling windows, often with strip views, which is beautiful at night. If I don't stay Fri or Sat night, I can always get a comp room, just by being a Total Rewards member, even if I haven't been lately or lost a lot of money there. The resort fee sucks, but that's not exclusive to the Rio. It's at all hotels in\/near the Strip now, so there's not much alternative. The staff and housekeeping has always been nice to us, letting us check in early or out late if it's available for no charge. One time, the reservation was comped under my friend's name and account and her flight was cancelled, so she couldn't get in until the next day. They let me check in and stay the first night without any issue!

The buffet isn't bad, lots of options, but the line can get long. Go during the inbetween hours for less of a wait. The pizza place by the sports bar is decent and not as stupid expensive as most hotel restaurants in Vegas. But there are so many bars and restaurants here to choose from. The shuttle to and from the strip doesn't have great times or frequency, but cabs are cheap and parking is free and abundant.

The cocktail waitresses come by pretty frequently and the bartenders are nice. I like the diversity in slot and table offerings. Gift shop has some food and drink options as well to bring to your room. 

My favorite amenity, though, of the Rio is the pool. It is huge and so much fun in the warmer months. Best part is the adult pool, for sure. It is so much calmer with some fun music and frequent cocktail waitresses walking by. Everyone is always friendly hanging out there, but it's best during the off season. So busy on weekends in the summer. Topless optional, but there is no pressure either way. Most people seem to wear tops, but nobody cares if you don't either.

Yeah, it's a date place that smells like cigarette smoke. That seems to be all of Vegas at this point that is affordable for normal people. But I always enjoy my stay and can't wait until I can go back.",3,3,2

MONDAY: Valet took 45 minutes when we arrived. When we finally were able to register, there was a HUGE line. We waited roughly another 20 minutes, so over an hour to even start registration. That want well with the exception of the resort fees not being explained. Since we told them we had stayed here 2 years before and there were none then, that's not something that should've been missed. I also don't see the point of a resort fee for the internet and pool if you don't use them (we didn't). We ended up with a Strip view suite on the 37th floor, which was nice (their club is on the roof, so you'll be able to hear music). Considering that you're off the Strip, the view is ok. The bellman belongs at the Bellagio.

TUESDAY: Valet was an issue our entire visit. Today it took 30 minutes for the car to even be received. Due to that, when we were on our way out to go to a show , I called down to ask that our car be brought up as we made our way down. The person on the phone proceeded to speak to me in a way that a staff member should never speak to a guest, getting on me about my Total Rewards Member status, which I honestly did not know. He ended the phone call by telling me that I BETTER tip the valet well. We always took care of them anyway, but that was incredibly out of line. When we reached valet and I turned over the ticket, the moment he realized who I was, he launched into another out of line tirade that shocked us both (she hadn't heard what he said on the phone). We walked to the car stunned and decided to not let him ruin our night. However when we returned, I called down to the front desk to speak to someone and was told to call back in the morning after 6am. 

Early in the morning, I had a medical issue and needed to call for the in house EMT.  He was amazing and he even checked on me the next day. I have an anxiety disorder and panic attacks mimic cardiac issues and can be terrifying. I was having one of the worse panic attacks of my life. While the EMTs were tending to me, security was there and I realized later he had gone through my things, including opening the  (there were things open that neither of us opened). He didn't engaged with me at all and the EMTs found no signs of drug use (I hadn't done any). He also found nothing. But that was so rude and I found out later from the front desk staff that he didn't have the right to go through my things. He should have been fired (I've since read other issues with security here). I did mention to her that I wanted to be moved to another property and she told me that I needn't worry about valet or security.

WEDNESDAY: I called down to speak to the front desk and after I relayed what had occurred the night before, I was asked to come down to fill out an incident report. While I was there, she told me something interesting. She said people often complain, but rarely fill out incident reports, meaning that problem staff stays on until they have enough evidence to fire them without fear of a lawsuit. For everything that happened, she felt a $30 credit was enough to make up for it. I returned upstairs and we were both hungry, so we decided to go to the Hash House A GoGo only to find that it was closed. It opens at 6a and closes at 1p except on Sat\/Sun when it closes at 3p. We went to the All American Bar and Grille. 

To say the service was slow is an understatement. The food was passable and our server was ok, but the length of time it took for us to get our food was unacceptable. The $30 credit didn't even handle half our bill and we only ordered entrees and non-alcoholic drinks. 

THURSDAY: At the exit there was a car that had been in an accident and the driver abandoned it. They didn't move it where it could have freed up traffic, but just left it there to make exiting harder. It was just being towed out when we returned several hours later. And again, valet took entirely too long to retrieve our cars even though we always let them know we'd be going out again. 

FRIDAY: While checking out, I spoke with the manager (her tag said Hotel Manager) and explained that I wasn't happy with what had happened or the way it had been handled (the original person I spoke to was then on vacation). All told, they only comped about $90 total for security and valet getting way out of line to a repeat customer. 

A few of the reviewers are lying to make The Rio seems better than it is. Why, I have no clue. Unless you are used to low end hotels, you will not be happy here. What it was before means nothing. What it is now is a disgrace to Vegas and Vegas hospitality. Make another choice.

Edit: Ever since I posted my review, I have gotten a bunch of nasty messages disguised as compliments. My guess is that they are Rio employees or friends of the valet I had an issue with.

My expectations are usually higher for non-strip hotels because there's so much to see and do on the strip, why would I wanna go off the beaten path?

Room deals or should I say suite deals since Rio is an all-suites hotel. Their price is pretty decent but you get what you pay for. The rooms could use some upgrades. For this stay, they ran out of queen doubles so we had to settle for a King with a pullout. It wasn't so bad. We had to call housekeeping for the mattress cover and pillows. It took them half an hour to fulfill our request.

There's mini bar for you midnight munchies and a mini fridge to keep your booze chilled. Who doesn't like pre-gaming, right? 

As for food options, they have 3 buffets: Carnival World, Seafood, and Indian. For your Asian cravings, there's Pho Da Nang and a dimsum place. And then there's the BK burger bar.

The casino itself wasn't too bad. The female cocktail servers are scantily clad and double as go-go dancers on stage. Various game options and the minimums here seem to be lower compared to some strip casinos.

We had a booth at the WWIN show so we stayed here because it was convenient(in my opinion it be worth it to drive 15 minutes to another hotel), my boss paid for the room, and there ends the extent of happiness for this stay. There were 5 people in our group 4 had an unpleasant stay, these are their stories.
 
1. One room the a\/c didn't work and wouldn't get below 80 degrees.. it's 100 degrees outside at midnight during august in Las Vegas. Several calls to the front desk, twice did any one come up to even look at the wall a\/c unit, nothing was ever fixed.
2. One room it took 45 minutes to get hot water in the shower if at all. She valets her car and it took them 45 minutes to retrieve it while standing outside in 113 dry heat. She complained to the guy that takes the tickets to get your car why it was taking so long, and he asked her, ""well did you tip the valet?"". When the guy arrived with her car she asked him why it took so long? His reply ""did you tip the guy in the booth?""
3. One room same problem no hot water.
4. My room, when I checked in the lady asked me king bed?.. yes its only me.. well we don't have any available are 2 queens ok?.. that's fine(did I have a choice?) also she needed a credit card to put on file, after several minutes of tryin explain that the boss has his on file hes paying for the room, I ended up just giving her one with the understanding that she just needed to see a physical card and it wouldn't be charged, it was, and had to be refunded and charged to the correct card. I can deal with the 27"" tube tv no biggie, but it didn't even have basic cable, kinda sad for a big fancy las vegas hotel to only have 5 channels in a room. Also, the tv in my room faced one wall, the sofa another one, so I rearranged the furniture completely so I could watch tv. My problem with the valet, they brought my truck quick enough, but only after hitting a curb or something and scratching one of my rims (that cost $750 apiece). I caught it before I drove off and complained to the guy that brought it, he said he has to call security, id have to file a claim, I was already running late for a business dinner, and wasn't going to blow my chances at making $ for these guys to tell me ""no we didn't hit anything you must of brought it in like that.""

All the rooms: if you are staying in the masquerade tower in floors 23 or higher be prepared to wait up 7 minutes for the elevator to get to you (there are 4 of them when we stayed one wasn't working) no free internet, $13.99 a day or $32 for a weeks use.

All the showers have a window in them so you can see the living room, people in the living can also see you in the shower, and if you don't close the shower door they can watch you dropping a deuce. Room service is crazy over priced ($300+ to get 3 medium pizzas, bread sticks, salad and soda delivered to your room) the restaurants in the hotel are crazy over priced ($20 for a large one topping greasy pizza, nothing else).. sonic burger is 2 blocks away (double bacon cheese burger, large onion rings and huge drink $7.99)

None of the food options are open after 1030 pm. We had training to attend it is held at this hotel. Plan ahead stay someplace other than the Rio. The shower has a gross nasty shower curtain that are just nasty. Taco diner and few drinks was $ 100 dollars. Over priced outdated. Went to the outdoor deck bar rude employees and yes you guessed it over priced drinks. The staff Treated us like crap at the rooftop bar don't wast your time.

My room has always been nice and clean and quite spacious I might add compared to other hotels. The choice of restaurants is pretty good. I like Pho, Smashburger, The American Grille, but you can't go wrong with their buffet either. 

I believe that the price is one of the best in town. So what if your not right on the strip. You are located behind Caesars Palace which is, in my opinion, the best part of the strip. The Rio has always treated me right. I have found their customer service to be fair and good. I come every year to play poker and relax by the pool. You can choose from a few different daily poker tournaments if you want or play cash games. The dealers have always been nice, as well as the waitresses. 

Overall, I would not still be coming back if it wasn't nice. I hope to take my son here some day when he gets old enough to teach him poker. but until then I will continue to make my trip yearly to The Rio. Thanks to staff for always treating me right.",0,0,1

Seeing half naked men was funny at first, but after staying 3 nights it was just disgusting. A lot of women are gonna laugh at me for this, but keep your fantasy's to yourself. I'm sure those posters are looking at me and only about 10% or less are looking at women :P. I'm not hating I know and respect Vegas, but I don't want see it when heading to my room its not very classy or tasteful.

Now that I have got that cheap feeling out of system and took a shower, time to REVIEW! Overall this hotel packs a lot of bang for your buck! It is not as fancy, new, luxuries as some of the multi-billion dollar resorts on the strip. If you are a bargain shopper and want a decent stay this place is definitely for you. I stayed 3 nights during the week for about $80 or $90. It wasn't too busy at all. I received a handful of coupons for buffets and various hotels. Rio is part of Total Rewards connect to about 7 hotels like Paris, Ceasers, Bally's to name a few. I didn't have a chance to try out the clubs, but the coupons last until the end of the year, so next time I can get my party on. No worries, you can still be a pimp with coupons just do a secret hand shake with the coupon and your girl will be impressed. 

The room is definitely a roomy! The standard room came with a king or queen bed with a L couch, mini refrigerator, desk, and safe. Think of Venetian or other suite minus the luxury, but still having the size and amenities. The bathroom had tile and there is a make up chair and mirror outside of the bathroom. Perfectly designed for women ready to get their freak on later that night. One odd thing I noticed was a small window facing out of the bathroom that blended in with the bedroom mirror. If you look closely its not double sided and you can see in to the shower. At first I thought this was both kinky and perverted. Good thing I wasn't sharing the room with a large group of people. Later that evening, it made sense... I was getting ready for dinner and a looked out the window from the inside the bathroom. It turns out, I could still watch a movie from the window, because its the perfect angle to see the room. Or you can view to strip if you have your window blinds open. The view is awesome! I think that's what the Rio is know for. Great view of the strip. The room is so big I could easily play soccer or workout there. I noticed you can get some free workout videos on-demand. If you are on the bed and your friend is on the couch you may want to call her cell phone because there is a very large empty space. Maybe you can fill it with sleeping bags and college friends. 

Cons: The hotel is a bit old and dusty at times. The central A\/C helps with the air circulation. The TV is like a 25 or 30 inch standard old school TV. No LCD, flat screen, or HDTV... sad. You should not be there to watch TV. Limited TV line up with no TBS, TNT, or HBO to watch movies. Most hotels do provide a good line up of channels and at least MTV, so you can get your groove on when they aren't showing crappy reality TV shows. You have to actually swivel the TV toward the couch or bed for optimum viewing. Chippendale posters BOOOOO! 

PROS: Buffets! Carnival World Buffet was voted THE BEST by Vegas locals. The Village Seafood Buffet is excellent, much better than normal buffet varieties. For more on both, see my other reviews.",3,3,3

For my 21st birthday, I spent the night at a room here. I must say, quite a fun place to spend a 21st birthday at!

Room: HUGE. To begin with, it was already in the older tower and yet it was still quite impressive. Two comfortable beds, a couch, a chair, a table\/mini-office space and a fridge....it was almost like a miniature apartment. The view was also quite amazing, looking right over the pool and straight at the Strip. Oh, and it had a fridge, a plus seeing I needed to have refreshments for the get-together I was having.
Service: Can't really say, we were just partying it up in there. 
Location: Not on The Strip, but close enough, with free shuttle service to Harrahs and Ballys. 
Pool: It was amazing with a bold, capital A. Crowded, but not overwhelmingly so. Beautiful people all around, and not overrun with the douchebags you see so much of at somewhere like, say, the Palms or Mandalay Bay pool areas. One cheesy, but cool touch was the waterfall that came out of a clam. 
Miscellaneous: As great as the room was, I was charged a security deposit of $50 that I had no way of knowing about beforehand. At least it wasn't a blasted resort fee, but still.

The Final Verdict:

Pros:
More than enough space.
Fridge in the room.
Lovely view.
Epic pool.
Free shuttle to the Strip.
Nice enough bathroom. 
Offered two free passes to the Voodoo Lounge.
Lots of things to do on the property.
Got the room for a pretty sweet price as well ($53.00).

Cons:
Sneaky security deposit. It's refunded when you check out but still. 

Suggestions: Please let people know about the security deposit in advance. So next time someone wants to have their birthday there they won't be $50 short on drinking and partying funds.

And, along the wall where a sign posted ""emergency phone"" There was no phone! So, we continued along towards the exit signs until the sign read, ""Alarm will sound if door opened"" At this time we didn't care. We still had to get out.

The Hotel Lobby\/Downstairs\/Casino - While the casino and lobby aren't the most elegant, they are well-maintained and not so vast that you need allow a half an hour to walk to and from your room (like with some of the other casinos). The place is VERY smoky - I was seriously shocked to see people wheeling their babies through the clouds of secondhand smoke. In no time during my daughter's infancy would I have thought to take her to Las Vegas - ugh. Even if you have a non-smoking room, just walking through the casino will be enough to drench your luggage in wafting clouds of smelly nicotine. Plan on washing EVERYTHING you bring with you - regardless of whether or not you ended up wearing it. 
CHECK IN - The check-in time was a bit late and the line was LONG! But the staff moved quickly and got us checked in without any hassle. 

THE ROOM - Our desk agent, Steven, was awesome and put us into a great room with a king-size bed, fabulous view of the Strip - the zip line literally went right past our window - it was funny watching everyone be terrified! The bed was super comfortable and all the furniture was cute and functional. I was kind of bummed that they anchored this big dresser and TV right in the middle of the gorgeous view, it would have been better to leave the view purely unobstructed because it is fabulous! The bathroom area was divided into a large vanity area and a tiny room for the toilet and shower (two sinks - one at the vanity, one in the tiny bathroom). The water pressure SUCKED - seriously it was like trying to get clean with a water fountain. Plus, in an effort to be artsy, they have this window from the tiny bathroom into the bedroom - which is just weird and completely nonsensical, the doors are thin, and there is NO ventilation fan - so if you're someone who has bathroom performance anxiety when others are listening, like me, this set up isn't ideal.

CASINO - I liked that the casino wasn't so huge that you got lost easily. There were also plenty of low-stakes blackjack tables (my game of choice), but for the most part the dealers they employ are sour-faced, unattractive, uncharismatic people who look they REALLY don't want to be there. They have this go go dancer gambling areas where live women dance while you gamble, as a woman, it made me feel way too much like I was Tony Soprano. I also couldn't believe the idiocy of some of my fellow gamblers - no consistency, hitting on 13 when the dealer's showing a 2! Gah!!!! I joined the Total Rewards program, but half the slot machines I put it into couldn't read it (but it worked fine at some of them and at the tables.

FOOD - We (wisely) brought a 

THE GOOD - It was nice that the hotel wasn't so huge that leaving the room felt like a hike. But the hotel also felt big enough that we were able to stay in for a full night and not lack for things to do - we ate the the American Steak House, saw Penn and Teller, gambled, and debated going to the Voo Doo Lounge, but were pretty poor after Penn and Teller. It would be nice if the hotel could offer guests a 2 for 1 deal to the nightclub, that way it would encourage people to go and they would spend money on drinks inside. We were there for my 37th birthday, and it was nice to feel like were weren't the oldest people there - in fact, we felt like some of the youngest. Large mix of people, lots of diversity and not super judgmental - like you shouldn't feel too self-conscious about taking your shirt off at the pool (which isn't bad, but nothing compared to some of the other more opulent hotels on the strip - sneak over to one of those if you're looking for a kick ass pool. 

THE BAD - The gift shop staff were HORRIBLE! They wouldn't accept my photo ID so I could use my ATM card. I had to walk down the hall to the ATM machine, which charged me $7.00 to take out the $10 I needed to buy my husband some cereal and milk. I was LIVID. The manager's name was Ben Levitt (I believe) and he was so the most unaccommodating, rudest, person at your entire establishment. I was so turned off that it really will impact whether or not we stay with you again - as up until that point we were planning to make The Rio our regular hotel and come back with a large group of our friends in a few months, but I don't know if I want to subject people to the rudeness of that particular employee (who really made me feel like I was insignificant and not valued as a customer).

This review is for those that like me are there for something other than gambling.
Let me get my one complaint out of the way, which is there is not enough low cost eating options in the hotel which wouldn't be an issue on the strip but since the Rio is off strip you're kind of trapped unless you want to drive or cab it somewhere else. That being said it's an all-suite hotel so each room has a refrigerator so just do what we do and buy food for breakfast and lunch and spend your money on dinner or better yet the buffet which is great, this would be high praise from me you see because I had a bad incident at a Home Town Buffet once which really put me off that dining concept forever, that is until I ate at the Rio's Buffet.
The convention space is great very roomy and much better than the old hotel where the Star Trek convention used to be held, I'm not refusing to name it I just have no idea what they're going by today as they have changed their name a couple of times since I was last there. While I'm on that subject I can't say enough about how well the Rio treats the Trek fans while the old place acted like we were some sort of inconvenience the Rio has been very welcoming every year and the room rate is better than Motel 6 as is the cliental, I'm reasonably sure the FBI could find most of their most wanted list at the Motel 6 in Las Vegas, not that you need to know that but they're likely reading this review since they read everything and I just thought I'd give a heads up.",2,2,1

Always asked for a high floor and away from the elevators and non smoking. They always gave us what we asked for if they had it available.

We loved staying here because the rooms were always so spacious, Not like a typical motel room. The views are beautiful from the Rio too!

We always gambled at the properties tied in together so we could use our players card at each one. Even though the Rio is not on the strip they do shuttle you to the other properties we never used it because we had our own car.

The Rio also has had some great shows over the years and some good restaurants that we hated to see go.. And they still have one of our favorites.

We weren't too crazy about the bevertainers that changed a lot because it made it nosier and when gambling near these areas. And a few other changes over the years but we still liked going here.

I LOVE the self check-in\/out kiosks! So fast and easy to navigate, so in less than 5 minutes, we had our room keys and a map on how to locate our tower elevators! 
The casino is nice, and from what I saw on the grounds, there were many places to eat and grab a drink. 
The room is gorgeous. Hands-down. I knew they were ""all suites,"" but the square footage still impressed me. The couch in our room was a tad worn\/distressed and I was bummed it didn't pull out into a sleeper sofa. This trip was with my two daughters (11 & 14), so in saving on the room rate with a King (instead of 2 queens), would have been a little cramped. So, the youngest chose to sleep on the couch. There wasn't any extra blankets, so I kept the heat up enough and gave her the sheet off the bed. 
I refuse to give a hotel 5 stars, when they do not offer coffee in the room. It's the dumbest thing ever, in my opinion.

My first impression of this place was it was a bit outdated and old. I had heard that Danny from Count's Kustoms had a tattoo shop inside the hotel. That's actually how I recognized the Rio Hotel and Casino. 

I went in and noticed it's a bit old. It's not nearly as dingy and gross as Binion's on Freemont Street, so that was a good sign. Lol. The casino is big, and I found several machines that I enjoyed playing. 

I love the KISS themed section they have. I took several pictures with the KISS VW Bug that was custom designed and painted in there. That was probably the highlight of my visit, and some of my favorite pics with my mom that we took during the trip. So kudos for that one, right there.

The property has definitely seen its better days - just kind of old and worn down. If you sign up for the Total Rewards card you can get some smokin' rates too - so if you're on a budget that might be handy.

The rooms are all suites here, which is nice. They're quite spacious and comfortable. Overall, nothing about this place blew me away or made me want to come back. I didn't really see anything in the way of customer service - the staff all just seemed to have blank expressions and didn't really offer up any recommendations unless asked. Again, no biggie, but I just didn't feel like anyone there was very personable.

As I've mentioned before, I'm usually not too picky when it comes to hotels - if it's clean and there's a comfortable bed, I'm good to go. I suppose the Rio fit the bill. Relatively clean (though the hallways were ALWAYS littered with in-room dining remnants) and my toilet would sometimes make weird gurgling noises. 

Oh and side note on the Rio - Voodoo Steakhouse and Lounge (located at the top of the Rio) are both actually really nice. If you don't stay at this hotel, it's worth it to check out the food and view one night during your trip to Sin City.",4,1,1

We grabbed our keys and ventured to the elevator to bring us to our room in the Masquerade Tower. Our room was perfect- big, clean and in an awesome spot. I loved looking out our window to view the hotels on the strip, and we also had a view of the hotel's zipline (which kept me entertained all hours of the day).
Housekeeping always came kind of later in the day, which was perfect for us because we needed those extra hours of sleep when drinking all night lol.
Room service was kind of pricey, but it always is! However, it was fast and of good quality.

The casino area is a bit small and pricey. I love to play cards especially paigow. When I play paigow I usually like to enjoy myself and take it slow while the cocktail waitress brings me drinks, but I couldn't do that when the paigow tables cost $15 a hand. Going here with $100 would only last me a few hands. One other thing was that I actually came here to try a new game that they didn't have at other casinos (Asia Poker) $25 hands were just to ridiculous with the bankroll I brought to this casino means that I only have 4 hands to play if I lost every single hand. Yeah the game was new and it was one of the reasons why we went to this casino. So I decided, heck I should just try a few hands (even though I've never even played this game before) maybe I can bring some beginners luck to the table. What do you know I lose the first hand and after that, I had a decision to make either stay for another hand and try to get my money back that I don't completely know the full game about, or try my money some where else. Since I was already sitting at the table I just again said, hell with it I'm going to just stick around and try my luck. After a few more hands I ended up losing $25 at the table and moved onto playing 3 card poker.

All in all this casino just seemed a bit small, they had a few shops, but nothing to interesting for me to stick around and look in any shops. What I did find interesting though when sitting at the tables was their ""male cocktail waiters"" pretty weird which left me a bad impression when sitting at a card table and leaving the casino. HHhmmmm.....I'd rather go to another casino off the strip than this one and plus their are others casinos just down the street that I'd prefer than this one.

People always say its just off the strip... technically ok, but it is across a freeway over the strip. I love the food options and have no complaints whatsoever... we even go to their seafood buffet when we aren't staying there.

I booked a room and I guess they overbooked rooms and was upgraded to a suite!! WHAT!?!?!?! And the suite was beautiful. I was sad I was there for work and not with hubby... that huge room all alone for a week :( but no complaints.

The rio is an older hotel\/casino off the strip, so it's dated, but it's still nicer than most of the hotels in down town Las Vegas, but it has a tough time keeping up with the higher end hotel\/casinos on the strip...

The new automatic check-in kiosks are awesome - it was great to be able to check in quickly without having to wait in line.  Also, it was awesome to be able to upgrade to an amazing suite for only $30 per night ... I would say the room upgrade was the best part of my stay although the rooms here should get upgraded because they are waaay dated.

The hotel is fairly clean, but there's not a ton of stuff going on here ... Some okay food...

At any given time half the elevators were down.  I guess it didn't help there was a large conference happening but they have to be used to this and they need more than 2 or 3 elevators working at any time.

The rooms are dated but really large.  Half the things in my washroom worked well.  The service wasn't that great, getting help was a pain, like getting my keys changed because they stopped working for some reason.

The shuttle only goes to Harrah's now.  I don't think I'd stay here again as it was such a mission to get back to my room due to the elevators but if you're on a budget it's a great option.

I went to Rio Hotel for the weekend for a girls trip and my birthday, and from the moment we set foot on the property everything that could go wrong did go wrong but what made it so bad is when they couldn't pretty much appease us with free tickets, they were very uncooperative and ""NO"" seem to be the only thing that they were good at saying to us.  
So let me break it down first it took us almost 2 hours to check in then we were told all the rooms are suites but they were placing us in a part of the hotel that was due to be renovated everything in the room was old and soiled.
They never vacuumed, the couch you wouldn't be caught dead sitting on They was leftover food dried on the furniture,windows were filthy and we were under the assumption it was a two bedroom suite it was not... this was a two beds in a room.
Now imagine six grown females two beds one bathroom. 
Now to take it a little bit further the air-conditioning wasn't working and we had to have housekeeping come up three times. One to remove and replace the couch, second to clean the room, (It was supposed to be a non smoking room) third to fix the air conditioning. I'm sure you're wondering why we just didn't move to another room. Well they wouldn't let us! The room for the weekend was almost $1000 so if you ever go to the Rio make sure you ask which tower is being renovated and make sure that they put you in the tower that has just been completely redone this complication made our girl trip not such a great trip.",2,0,0

I didn't handle our reservation or check in, so all I can say is that we were able to get a room for what seemed to be a good price, with a couple of days notice, during the WSOP.

Our room was a two bed suite in the Masquerade Towers with an awesome view of the mountain skyline and the pools. The room itself was very nice- large, with a couch and sitting area, extended bathroom area with counter and sink outside of the toilet\/shower space. Both beds were super luxe- comfortable pillow top mattresses that worked well for a group that liked both soft and firm beds, with clean and fresh quality linens and lots of pillows.  
The only odd thing about our room was that there was a small window in the wall inside the shower, looking into the bedroom. I don't know if it's intended so that an adult can keep eyes on kids while taking a shower, or so that you can watch TV while in the shower (which is what I did), or if the room was created for some wacky swingers group and I just wasn't told about it. Either way, it was odd but not a problem or anything. One of our group was a little put off by it, but was easily able to tuck some rolled up extra towels in the space to avoid anyone looking in at him- although no one was even trying, for the record.

The property itself has a lot to offer, from the Carnival Buffet, American Grill, Sports Deli, Yogo Gogo, and Evening Call for drinking and dining options,  to the poker room and WSOP tournament in the convention space, as well as hosting the Penn and Teller show (though we didn't see it). There were always employees in sight if anything was needed, and most of them were helpful when we had any questions or concerns. 

Though we'd probably stay somewhere cheaper in the future if the bill was our responsibility, this hotel and casino was a really good pick and we very much enjoyed our time here! Highly recommend.",2,1,0

Summer hotel sale: Recently, Rio Suites has been my preferred choice for short stays during my personal business trips. Caesar's Entertainment has a summer sale. Deals are honestly awesome! On a weekend stay I got a double queen deluxe suite for base price $56. Weekday stay I booked a king suite base price $30.  

Total Rewards benefit: All it takes is SIGN UP for TOTAL REWARDS MEMBERSHIP for FREE. I earned a $25 food credit too! Had to order in room service & credit is given at check out. You can pick non-smoking \/ smoking rooms;  mountain views \/ strip views;  single king size bed \/ double queens. And what of the resort & service fees? Not bad... still a great deal!

Location: Close enough to the strip, but isn't crazy trying to leave the hotel lot. Easier access to suburb area eateries & shops. A block away from Bellagio & Caesars Palace. A walk away from Palms.

Amenities: An awesome pool, gym, spa, great restaurants, cool bars (Purple Zebra too cool), popular shows (Rock of Ages, Chippendales, Penn & Teller).  Didn't get to see any but this is where they're at. This hotel has two Starbucks'.

Early check in: is $20 fee.  Standard check in time is 4pm; check out 11am. FYI Sunday early check in is the same line as check out guests. Complimentary water bottles are given out with long lines. Schedule a check in online & email confirm directs you to fall in the Keys & Mail line. Security checks card keys at the Masquerade Tower elevators, but not at Ipanema Tower.

Professionalism: I got slightly lost. Coming from the Masquerade parking structure, there are directions as to which floor takes you to the casino - from the 4th floor parking structure it  brings you to the 2nd floor hotel shops . There aren't any signs directing toward guest registration until I was in the casino. 
The main number to call for information seemed like the call center was in another country cuz the representative didn't seem to know the layout of the hotel, and what she was saying sounded like she was reading off a script - which didn't answer my question. So I just kept walking.
After finding guest reg, they were friendly, patient, quick, & informative. Clearly disclosing resort fee, outlining stay details, and courteous even with a long line on Sunday. Thanks for not being huffy & puffy. And Marilyn from room service delivered my breakfast before the 30 minutes they mentioned.

Recommendation: You'll enjoy your stay. Just try to avoid calling the 800# and ask an in house rep your questions.",22,14,19

Pros: 
-Just off the Las Vegas strip, so avoiding the typically major strip traffic but still near all the action. Note that one of the busiest intersections, LV Blvd\/Flamingo is just around the corner.
-Rooms are larger than the average hotel room. Included mini-fridge. The rooms ain't 5 star but aren't trashy either. There have been some minor problems a few times, but nothing to ruin a trip.
-At least in my experiences, except for one major incident*, the employees have been real friendly and interactive.
-Parking is ample. There are 2 parking structures, one each on opposite ends of the property and valet is also an option.
-Locals get 50% off the Carnival buffet Monday to Friday lunch and 25% at a couple other food spots. There's a few other locals discounts but that is the most popular one I believe. Pho shop & Deli next to Sportsbook is good for a quick bite.
-Penn & Teller, if you're into magic shows.
Cons:
-Late night dining options are pretty slim. BK Whopper bar on one end of the property and All-American B&G(which if you saw my reviews, I've had bad experiences). Usually friends and I will venture off property for late night grinds. There's room service too I suppose, if you're staying there.
-Machines(video poker\/slots) payouts & table game limits are in line with strip casinos. There is the Palms across the street and Gold Coast next door that offer better gaming options in both aspects.
-For being the home of the World Series of Poker, the poker action is pretty sparse there. Even when there is a game, its mostly locals too.
The Rio seems to try to market themselves as a locals casino with things like food discounts, 2-4-1 tickets to certain shows, staycations. Priority parking for local Diamond\/Seven Star members. It can't be easy with 2 casinos next to them who offer more to local players.
I believe the Rio sure beats staying at some of the lower end casino\/hotels on the strip. The room prices are in mid range. At the same time, it doesn't compare to places like the Venetian, Bellagio, Wynn etc. But overall not a bad option depending on your budget\/needs.

*Three years ago, when I had a Seven Stars Companion players card. Friend and I were playing craps. In the middle of my turn, the pit boss interrupts my roll to 'ask' if I had another players card since this one isn't valid. I tell him it's definitely valid and current but he claims to never have seen this card before. What sucks is, right after this brief exchange, I throw the dice and crap out. You could hear a collective groan from the table of players. If you're familiar with gaming etiquette and craps in particular, it's considered bad luck to interrupt someone's turn like that and like clockwork, I lose right away. I was calm but not happy. I think the rest of the players weren't too glad about what happened. I know my friend was pretty mad about the pit boss interrupting my turn. Of course we both stopped playing right then, but I had to wait while the pit boss sorted it out. I found out he had called the shift manager. She showed up and did some calling and running around, I guess finding out if my card was real or not. After keeping us waiting about 15-20min, she finally introduced herself and explained the situation. She said she had not even seen that particular players card either but did check into it and indeed I am exactly what my card says I am and apologized for the inconvenience. When we cashed out at the craps table, all the pit boss said to us was 'good luck.' He didn't seem sorry at all for his lack of tact and etiquette. I was ok though since the shift manager cleared it up and felt really bad about it all.",4,0,0

I should have warned you to stay away from this Hotel du Yuck while I was there, but I waited until I was safely back at home. 

This was my 4th trip to Vegas in as many years and I've stayed in a different hotel each time. After about 1.5 hours in the Rio, I thought it was scheduled for demolition in the very near future. 

Start with the understaffed check-in counter. When I arrived the line wasn't terribly long but it still took about 45 minutes to get checked in. Later in the day it stretched for yards and people were complaining of hour plus wait times. Welcome to Las Vegas!

Then there is the general condition of the hotel. I think the word I want is ""Ratty."" Not filled with rats! Just worn down and scuffed and not maintained.

And then there was my room. I was there for a conference and my room was actually pretty good in comparison to what some of my fellow attendees endured. I only had nasty stained sink counters a sink that gurgled when I or the person in the neighboring room flushed the toilet (gag.) 

I won't comment on what other conference attendees complained of - they can write their own dang reviews - except to say again that my room was one of the good rooms.

But not all hotels are four star hotels. I understand there are different standards for hotels off the strip. What earned the Rio its solo star is the way it sold these rooms - These were in the Ipanema tower and offered as a special deal. Yeah, because they're all slated for remodeling and in various states of Skank. Oh that's cute.

So the lesson for today Yelpers - If you see a really sweet deal for a room in LV, ask if the room is scheduled for remodeling. If they say yes, proceed with caution.",4,2,0

There is a $30 ""resort fee"" added each day to the room rate, that doesn't really cover much. One pro is that they still seem to have free parking.

Poker room: I called the room and went through their prompts and it rang and rang for about 4 minutes, so I called back and let it ring while driving there to see how long it would take. It rang for a full 14 minutes and no one picked up. The room itself was not great and I had a great dealer named Devon, but another terrible dealer (I didn't get her name as she wasn't even wearing a name tag). Overall, there are far better rooms to play in on the strip. 

Table games: it's your average lower end casino games-one benefit is lower minimums than some of the nicer hotels. Nothing much to note, here.

Pros:
- The suites are definitely large, but our room in the Masquerade Suites either hadn't been renovated, or remained a fixture of the 1970s. CRT TVs and old carpet. This was definitely the most out-dated room I've stayed in in Vegas (compared to the Luxor Towers, MGM, and Hilton.) Despite stepping into the past, the larger room is definitely a plus; it just wasn't what was advertised on the web site (at all.) 
- The overall atmosphere of the casino is much more energetic than the Hilton. It has a nice show, shopping, and dining area (towards the Masquerade towers). Two Starbucks and a fair amount of restaurants. 
- They offered Zumba classes, which my room mate took part in. They were held outside in the pool area and while I never made it down to the pool, I liked how many pools they had. 
- Convention space was HUGE. Sadly, the main hall and vendor's room were spaced pretty far apart (not bad since I don't mind the walk, but I did feel bad for cosplayers in difficult costumes or hells.) 

Cons:
- Of the few casinos I've stayed in in Vegas, the Rio was the only one that made me sick. I'm not sure if it was poor ventilation or old carpet, but despite all casinos allowing smoke, it has never affected me as much as it did in August. I woke up hoarse every morning and had the sniffles every day (not a full blown cold, but similar to an allergy, although I have none.) 
- Though there were a variety of restaurants, they're all open varied hours and the food wasn't superb at any of them. I didn't get a chance to try the famous Carnival Buffet (when I did walk by, it was PACKED) but the breakfast buffet was formidable. The seafood buffet restaurant was meh. We ate at the breakfast restaurant several times and it probably had the best food to choose from, but is breakfast only. My room mate sampled the seafood restaurant and wasn't impressed with it either. 
- Again, the outdated rooms could have been better.
- Shuttle system wasn't spectacular, either.

if I'm able to attend the convention again next year, I'd only stay at the Rio again out of convenience (and unreliability of the shuttle). Fortunately they've got that going for them, but I wouldn't stay here for any other reason.",4,0,2

Review:

My roommate and I stayed here for a convention in April 2016. We stayed a total of seven nights and it was a very uncomfortable experience to say the least. Not only was the hotel room not as described, but for such an expensive accommodation there is no coffee maker in the room. That may seem like a small complaint by when you are charge five dollars for every cup of coffee you buy in the casino area or at Starbucks, it really adds up. I mean, come on. Even a hotel six has a coffee maker in the freaking rooms.

Aside from that you do not feel as if you are staying in a expensive Casino Hotel, especially when there are no lampshades on the lights in the hallway's and you are walking over strips of duct tape that hold the carpet together. 

The beds are very uncomfortable and the pillows are like sacks of cotton balls. I have traveled a lot in my life and have never stayed at such a large, popular, and expensive hotel and gotten such terrible accommodations in return.

To make matters absolutely worse, my roommate has had awful allergies after we checked in due to her reaction that only happens when she is around mold. That's right, mold. The room smells musty so I am not surprised. But if you or anyone you are staying with has asthma or bad allergies then you should definitely stay somewhere else.

Because you are not close to the Las Vegas strip if you stay in the Rio, you are forced to eat at the few restaurants inside of the hotel. That means a lot of very long lines and cranky staff members. Not to mention grossly overpriced food. Oh yeah, and if you want to order room service there is an eight dollar fee tacked on to every single order you make. So suddenly that $18 omelette you've ordered has become a $26 omelette.

We did not have a choice in where to stay because of the conference we attended, but in the future, if we have any choice at all, we will never stay at the Rio again.",2,1,0

I told the female representative about the situation and asked her to make a note of what's going on.  I asked if someone needs to come up to the room to verify we did not touched anything and she said it was not necessary and she will make a note of it.  I made sure when I checked out I was only supposed to pay for the amount that was agreed and sure enough she said that was all she's shown I needed to pay.  When my billing statement came, I saw an additional transaction that tripled my other transaction.  Of course the first thing I did was call Rio to see what was going on.  I spoke with a female representative name Marie and she said she's shown I was only supposed to be charged the amount that I recognized.  She provided me with another phone number to call but said they're not available until Monday to help me out.  I don't know what's going on with management at the Rio.

I stayed at the Rio on Thu\/8 Nov using a $59 TravelZoo.com local deal voucher which included a 1 night stay, $30 dining credit and 2 passes to Voodoo Lounge.

5-stars because:
- All of Harrah's properties (Rio, Paris, Flamingo...) doesn't charge a resort fee (usually $20\/night) for a stay.
- Rio treats locals with TotalRewards especially well: 50% off drinks at any casino bar and The Irish Pub (which has a cool lounge area with sofas and room for beer pong), 25% off their restaurants (except for Hamada) and 50% off Rio Carnival World Buffett for me + up to 7 other people in my party and other discounts (eg show tix).
- Rio has that free Masquerade Parade in the Sky performance Thu - Sat.  It's ok but it is free (other free shows include Treasure Island's pirate show, Bellagio water fountain show, Mirage volcano eruption and the Fremont Street Experience).

Kind of a fluke:
- That $59 TravelZoo deal turned out really well for me since at the hotel I only had to pay an additional $3 or so in taxes\/fees (since there's no resort fee).  I checked the Rio website and an equivalent room that night was priced at $250+.
- TravelZoo also included a $30 dining credit which I used at the Rio Village Seafood Buffett (which I wasn't really impressed with).  I had been to the Voodoo Lounge before so I didn't bother to go there that time even though they have a great view (especially at night) of the Strip\/Vegas.

The all-suite guest rooms are great for big groups, lots of room for throwing shoes around and passing out drunk.  You can even request adjoining rooms with your buds for immediate access to borrow lipgloss or take group tequila shots.

I was recently in Vegas for a convention, which happened to be at the Rio. The show was worth it and a great event. Sadly I can't say the same about the hotel. They're larger 'suite' rooms are a plus but that's about where the positives end.

The rooms are incredibly outdated (circa 1980's) and there were so many things wrong with the room that I started a list to keep track. I won't list them all, but the highlights include a safe door in the closet that wouldn't close, preventing closet doors from opening properly. Frayed rug, filthy drapes, issues with shower doors, plumbing issues...the list goes on and on...

Also disappointing was the food in the restaurants. I was only able to find two places I could eat and neither were great. Although Smash Burgers was the highlight if that tells you anything (they had a decent veggie burger).

Each time was great, but that all changed with my most recent stay. My review is only for the ROOM, not the buffet, casino, or the casino floor shows.

 I went there for my birthday, Feb. 1, 2012, and we upgraded our reservation to the Masquerade Suite. Having stayed in the spacious apartment sized room (900 square feet, I think) with 360 degree views, a separate bedroom, huge living room and dining area, two bathrooms, a jacuzzi tub and TVs in the bedroom and living room,  I had high expectations, as our stay in October was wonderful. The room was clean, updated and lovely.

 Unfortunately, not all Masquerade Suites are created equal. 

First, I should have known anything on the thirteenth floor couldn't be good! I should have asked for another room immediately, however, I was ready to unpack, regroup and  get the party started.  My desire to start celebrating my birthday caused me to overlook the numerous flaws awaiting me as I came back to my room, ready for bed.

To my dismay, the water took FOREVER to get hot and the shower door was unhinged and wouldn't close AT ALL. I was afraid to try and force it, because it felt like I would pull it off its hinges! Yikes!

Then, I started noticing more and more issues one wouldn't want to find in the ""luxury"" suites. Now, I've stayed plenty of times in the regular suites and could overlook alot of this stuff, but when you're trying to upgrade a bit because of a special birthday event, willing to pay the extra bucks, you hope all the amenities will be there for you. This ""luxury"" suite was a DUMP!

The carpet was stained and burned (and this was a non-smoking suite)....there was someone else's hotel key card and discarded arm band in between the cushions of the sofa (which leads me to believe the house keeping staff didn't clean and vacuum that sofa, right?)....the duvet on the bed didn't seem clean AT ALL....the mini fridge didn't work....and the twenty year old  CRT tv's were a joke. The remotes didn't work and the picture was awful. PLUS, it smelled pretty musty and the windows were filthy. 

The last Masquerade Suite I stayed in had better TV sets for sure and it was clean and in great repair....not so with this thirteenth floor dump. If I'm paying the big bucks for a fancy suite (fancy for Rio, anyway) I want to feel like I'm experiencing a degree of luxury! This thirteenth floor suite was not luxurious at all, and the hotel shouldn't charge the same for it as they do the nicer Masquerade Suites, because they absolutely do not compare.

On the plus side, the bed was comfortable and the sheets were crisp and clean. Also, we had plenty of towels and two big closets with lots of hangers. 

Another thing I have observed at the Rio is the utter indifference the staff has if you complain about ANYTHING. When we said there was no hot water they just said to let it run a long time and acted totally annoyed that we dare complain that the shower wouldn't close! FAIL on that for sure.

It was my birthday, and although I have heard that special celebrations will often garner upgrades, or a bottle of champagne, that has never been my experience at the Rio. I have spent three birthdays with them and no one ever did anything special or say ""happy birthday"" or ANYTHING! We don't even stay through the weekend because my birthday is always around the Super Bowl and we get out of Vegas at least by Saturday, so it's not a super busy time for the hotel. I'm surprised they didn't offer us a nicer room, because I'm sure they weren't booked.

Despite being frequent guests, being Total Rewards members, paying for upgraded rooms when we could have had comped rooms, being nice, and tipping generously, Rio hasn't shown us any love lately!

I will say that if you gamble there, the cocktail servers are attentive and sweet, but despite others saying how sexy the girls and guys are, I find them anything but! They just look like regular folks trying to make  living and I totally respect that!

Bottom line, DO NOT take the Masquerade Suite on the thirteenth floor! It is not worth the money!!!! If you have comped rooms,go for one of those regular ""suites"" (I just say they are large rooms) but for something special, go somewhere else!

I'm going to try Paris or Planet Hollywood next time we go. Rio used to be a favorite, but the rooms aren't what they used to be.",7,0,0

I was at the Rio for a conference called Defcon, a computer hacking event. Kudos to the Rio for being willing to hold a conference like that, which I've heard can be hard to find a host hotel for.

I played some blackjack. The minimum bet was $15, our dealer was friendly to both the winners and losers and drinks were fast. Blackjack pays a traditional 3 to 2 at the Rio, which is a more desirable payout that narrows the house's advantage. While I was just having beers, a friend at the table was ordering top shelf cocktails and getting them almost immediately. Service was fast. Like any casino, drinks are free if you're gambling, but do remember to tip your server and your dealer.

There was plenty of storage as well as closet space.  The bathroom had the usual with a tub with a shower.  Getting into the tub to take a shower was a bit of a challenge.

The best thing about the hotel, for us, was the yogurt shop near the front entrance. Two nights in a row, we paid our $5, and figured our own way to ""fill the heck"" out of the 12 ounce cups that they provide. Your challenge, if you're up to it, is to fill up the cup with ""unlimited frozen yogurt"", and whatever toppings you can fit in... best deal in the hotel. 

If it hadn't been for our trade show being based out of the Rio a few months ago, I'd have stayed at one of the Hilton Grand Vacation Resorts in town, or far off the strip in Henderson.

So as we are trying to sleep, we just heard the base of speakers BOOM all f' ing night! And we had kids that needed to be up early to wrestle! Arghhhhh, we were pissed!

Not like you can walk up and down 30 flights of stairs! Third, the rooms are totally dated and not very clean. No one ever came to clean our room during our entire stay.  Fourth, ate breakfast at the breakfast cafe and it sucked.  The food sucked, the prices sucked (16 bucks for a bacon and egg breakfast) and the service sucked.  Fifth, I did spend some time at the tables there and ordered mai tais from the cocktail server.  I had about five of them and they were different every time!  Not one of the drinks I received was an actual mai tai!  Ewwwww.  Oh, and the slot machines suck too.  I probably lost $300 bucks on the stupid slots there.  So tight, didn't hit a damn thing!

Our flight was delayed a bit, and the shuttle took off late.

We arrived at 11:30pm to check-in along with a large group (they were probably in our flight). 

When our friend came up to the counter to check-in under her name, they said the double bedroom was unavailable. 

Apparently, the Rewards system we used is 'subject to availability'.  

With that said,  we were tired and resigned that this is not going to be a good Vegas Trip after all.

The most they could accommodate was to give us a King bedroom with a roll away bed in a 'renovated' room.

We had to go to the Masquerade Tower on the 9th Floor.

Our bedroom is a King sized bed. The rollaway is meant for 1 person (seriously, and if you are taller than 5ft. Good luck fitting in it).

And there is a small couch. 

The room itself is half-way renovated in my opinion. The carpet is still old and musky with some stains on it. The couch is definitely not comfortable. (I feel like I will sink in it if I sit on it).

The shower is substandard. It's loud and it seems like it takes awhile for it to start working (this was around 6:30-7am).

Oh and a creepy thing about this room? There's a window that you can look into from the bedroom.

We are hoping we can get the 2-bedroom. And the friends that are coming today can get a room as well. 

Here's hoping. And also a warning to others to not book through a Rewards system because of that subject to availability.",2,1,1

They didn't let me select 0 stars, but this is what this hotel deserves.

We proceeded to go downstairs and talked to customer service. Again, we were disappointed with the service. The guy who helped us, Jay, offered us 2 rooms that weren't connecting and at the very end of the hallway. He wasn't accommodating at all. He asked us if we wanted someone to come fix the lock so we asked him how long it would take. He said ""that's a good question"". We took the other 2 rooms because we thought he said it was connected and after walking back and forth, it was worse than the first 2 rooms we originally booked. We waited in the line again, which took another 20 minutes and spoke to Laverne. She asked us what was wrong while Jay was standing right next to her. We told her about the situation and she said ""why would you want to move back into the room with the broken lock?"" Well, if you guys could manage to fix our problems then maybe we could be staying in a working room. Not to mention, the pool was closed to a private event in the middle of the day.

So if you have had your fill of that, then the Rio is a great option! It's close to the Palm's Place and other resorts. It's also close to the Asian district of Spring Valley if you want to grab food or visit small businesses. 

The hotel is older. Things are not going to be brand spankin new and polished but it's not without its charm. We stayed in the Ipanema tower. The rooms were clean and minimal with a pleasant whites and earth tones. A friend of ours compared it to the Mandalay Bay. The room was spacious with a large vanity area separate from the bathroom. It was clean and comfortable and totally did reflected a remodel since the hallways outside looked more dated. The hallways of this tower reminded me of an old cruise ship.

The slots were alright but they did not have the newer slots that even downtown LV has. On one end of the casino floor there is a stimulated outdoor area with businesses on the second floor to peruse. It's supposed to look like an outdoor Rio De Janeiro. This area feels somewhat disconnected from the main casino floor. There is a stage here for live music also.  

The pool was icy cold. It isn't heated so plan to go while the sun scorches the water and warms it up. It was kind of a strange sensation. There are multiple pools of different depth and size including one large deeper one. 

All in all, if you are looking are a more quiet experience to explore LV slightly off the strip then I would definitely book at the Rio. It's a fun and casual experience. There are dancers on platforms for your entertainment while you gamble. The dealers are dressed in fun top hats and bowties like sexy magician assistants. If you have the moolah and are looking for a rich high end experience, then you probably need to go elsewhere. But this doesn't detract from the experience at the Rio!

Room: The first thing i noticed about my room was that it smelled nice. The room appeared to be clean, but alot of things in the room clearly showed its age and that takes away from it a bit. Nonetheless the room was ok in my book

I really didn't appreciate the interrogation by the front desk girl and felt as if she thought I was going to harbor a rowdy group of my pinoy kin in our room when it was just my hubby and I.

I especially disliked the fact that they charge you an additional $200 fee onto your card as a deposit on top of your room charge without notice or clear explanation.They said it was only when you used a debit card but the last time we were here and used the same card, we experienced no such charge. What gives? 

We got the standard room which was cool as it was very large and clean albeit a little unpleasant. Why? Perhaps because of the fact that there was this echoing of a thundering drip every time we used the sink. BOM BOM BOM...BOM BOM BOM. The loud noise would go on and on even after an hour of using the sink. Chinese water torture anybody? We tried to swap rooms but they wanted to downgrade us to an even smaller room. No bueno.

I had always been curious what it was like to stay at this Brazilian themed hotel. In late March when my dad flew into Vegas to spend a week, we decided on the Rio. In similar style to my reviews reporting on staying at a Las Vegas hotel, this is broken down to categories. Before I go on, since my dad paid for the hotel, pricing is omitted.

The Room: 

  The Rio's strongest point are their hotel rooms that are suites. We stayed in a room up in the Ipanema Tower. This is the largest Las Vegas hotel room that I have stayed in. It provided a northwest view where I enjoyed seeing the sun rise. The two flaws of this grand size room were that there was only a two drawer bureau for clothes and that the TV was to the side of the bed giving The Rio the honor of the first hotel room where the beds did not face the TV. In all honesty we were too busy hanging out at the Strip instead of in the room. The last thing I will write about the room is that the Maid did a great job keeping it clean.

The Casino & Public areas:

   Whereas the room was grand, the casino and public areas were ordinary bordering on dull. Unfortunately Rio Management dethemed  a large area of the Masquerade Village replacing Brazil meets Vegas with dullness. Gone are the parade,floats in the sky, and carnival vibe. In its place are banks of slot machines bordered by a sundry of vacant stores. In an attempt to bring some excitement to the Masquarade Village, the Rio opened a Kiss Miniature Golf in the former Seafood Buffet. 

   When in fact excitement is missing from the air, on the positive side so is smoke. The casino and public areas have strong ventilation that eliminates second hand smoke.

   When it comes to gaming, the Rio is competitive. The large casino offers acres of games of chance from live Black Jack to video Keno. Being that my game of choice is Keno, the casino satisfies my gaming needs by providing a spacious Keno lounge with a plenitude of Keno machines. 


Restaurants & Coffee: 

    The Rio is the home to Carnival World Buffet which happens to be one of my top Las Vegas buffets. I appreciate the 25% off for locals. On the other hand, I do not appreciate that the Rio replaced their cafe with a Hash House Go Go. In my opinion the casino cafe adds to the Las Vegas resort experience. Now instead of a cafe offering a variety of food 24 hours a day there is a void in dining during the late hours of the night. Hash House Go Go closed around 3 pm. Isn't Vegas 24\/7? Obviously not because the main Starbuck's in the Penn & Teller Theater Wing closed at 1 pm. Worse than closing early in the afternoon is closing for good. Recently the Rio replaced the Burger King Whopper Bar with a Smashburger.

Location:

    The best thing about the Rio's location is that the guest can spend most of the time on the Las Vegas Strip. The Rio runs a shuttle til 1 am between Bally's & Harrah's. Believe me we were on that shuttle twice a day. 

    The Rio is one of the three casino resorts making up a miniature Flamingo Road Strip. On my last day of the stay-cation, I walked this mini Strip. There is signalized crosswalk providing a safe crossing to the Gold Coast. Now in the Gold Coast, I walked through the casino to the southwest exit. Soon, in a signalized crosswalk, I crossed Flamingo Road to spend time in the Palms.

   If you are a local like me, the parking garage is advantageous. Parking is still free at the Rio. On the contrary to parking at a Strip resort, parking is as easy as 1-2-3. This makes it convenient to combine the Las Vegas Strip with the local spots.

Amenities:

   In my opinion, the greatest amenity at the Rio is the resort pool complex. If the weather had been a bit warmer, I would of spent hours splashing around in the vast swimming pools. However, I did spend a few hours relaxing on the chaise in the shadow of the Rio's towers. The Rio resort pool complex is more than a place to splash around and relax. It is a tranquil spot to enjoy an adult beverage in the sunshine.

   When it comes to the amenity of adult beverages, there are a couple of neat bars and lounges. The Voodoo Lounge up in the sky is one of the spots that I would like to try and add to my ""Rise Above It All"" list. If I was in the mood for Kiss music, the Kiss Miniature Golf bar would make for a spot to spend time with an adult beverage or few. In reality, the best spots to have adult beverages are on the Las Vegas Strip.

   One of the best amenities of staying at the Rio is that shuttle traveling across Interstate 15 to the nearby Las Vegas Strip. However, there are non guests using this shuttle to avoid the paid parking on the Strip. The consequence is that the shuttle is constantly filled to capacity.

My verdict: 

3 Stars ""Okay",13,5,11

We have gone there 9 times this year and have stayed in many great hotels, like Manaday Bay, Arias, Westin Lake Las Vegas, or ok hotels like Stratosphere (which is a better hotel than I had expected). It all depends on which hotel had a good deal for the weekend. 

I did a blind express deal and got Rio as a 4-star hotel. The price was great but I was concerned about the hotel, what with people saying it was dated, the rooms and linen were dirty, service was poor, etc. But my actual experience told a very different story.

First of all, I like the location. It is right off Flamingo Blvd, which is the very near the heart of Las Vegas at the junction of Flamingo Blvd and Las Vegas Blvd. No you can't just walk to the main strip from the hotel because I-15 separates you from the main strip. But we drove in, and it was not a problem. (Tip: if you want a room right on the strip for low dollars, go for Hurrah's. It's right in midst of the hustle and bustle but it is an older hotel.) Second, you should know that as the hotel's name implies, all the rooms are suites. That should be worth extra dollars but you don't end up paying extra.

I liked the check in experience. We dropped off the car with the valet and walked right in to the very large and colorful lobby. Check in was a breeze, and one big reason was because the check in counter was actually in the lobby. That's not like with many other expensive hotels where they make you walk through the entire casino to get to the counter (the Aria and the MGM Grand come to mind). Since it was already 9pm I asked if all the good rooms were gone. The clerk just smiled and said yeah most of the rooms are gone but no worries we are upgrading you to the Samba King suite. Sweet.

The elevator was clean, bright and polished. The hallways on my floor was coloful, festive, clean and bright. The room? Very big, clean and tastefully decorated. Even though it's a suite, there was no separate bedroom with a door. I don't want that anyway, but I suppose parents with kids might enjoy that privacy. The living room has modern and comfortable furniture. The king bed was firm and, most importantly, very clean. The bathroom was huge! Double vanity, separate shower room, and easily the size of a small motel room by itself. Young folks and budget-concious folks take note: you could sneak in 6 other people with sleeping bags and they can all sleep in the vanity room comfortably. Not that I would advise it cause you would have to step over them to go wash your hands or brush your teeth, but hey it can be done.

Anything negative? 1) Ok I did find one noticable stain on the bed-end sofa bench. Left by a romantic couple during their intimate fun, perhaps? I don't want to know but I don't sit there anyway. 2) They do charge you for coffee in the room and there is a resort fee, but that's par for hotels 4 stars and above, so I don't count it against them. You want coffe in the room and free breakfast in the lobby? Book a two-star motel and you'll be perfectly happy. 3) The Voodoo Lounge on the rooftop was pumping out massive amount of bass that resonated through the room. I talked to the front desk about it. They could move me back to an ordinary suite on a lower floor, but I really liked our room. So we stayed up until the music stopped around 1:30am. They did give me coupons for free entry to the Voodoo Lounge (if you can't fight'em, join them), but we were too full of food and alcohol to go anywhere lol! It was a Saturday night, so you should decide if the noise was unreasonable or not. We were not exactly happy about it, but we dealt with it. Rio has a young crowd and they party down, so be prepare to join them or stay away.

Overall, I like the hotel. You get a huge room for a cheap price (if you know how to hunt for the bargain), and it's centrally located. Tip: upgrade to a strip-view room for very little money. Ditto with the Samba King suites.",0,0,0

The Rio is one of the more depressing, smokier casinos I've been in; nobody in the place knows how to mix a decent drink; and the rooms are horribly dated. A two-star rating is generous.

As far as ""entertainment"" goes, it seems like no decent restaurant can remain open, leaving you with few dining options, and there really isn't a good bar. Yes, there are bars; I said ""good"" bar. What they do offer is as tired as the rest of the ""casino resort."" That said, the one thing I felt when I stayed there was tired.

Even if you're there for a convention, I'd recommend getting a room somewhere else. Most of the better places to stay are a very short cab ride away. And if you want to actually enjoy your time in Vegas, you're going to need to take a cab somewhere else anyway.

11\/2017 Updates; other travelers have noted elevator backups, but Not stating which Tower. In the past, I've noticed backups in the Impanema Tower. People have also noted Legionnaires Disease during recent stays. One traveler posted a Letter from the Rio claiming detection of the bacteria in the water system.

I've read many other reviews and have faced many of the Same Problems noted. Let's be fair and first state some Positives; large rooms, fast elevators, fairly convenient parking, and friendly front desk workers. Some Negatives; Resort fee, Long checkin line, 4P checkin, 11A checkout, Don't have room booked, and Outdated or lack of chairs in some rooms. I've always had friendly workers at the front desk. I think some travelers are taking out frustrations on the workers. But, it's not the workers fault for corporate decisions. You should be mad at Caesar's who owns it.

BEWARE OF RESORT FEES. Not anything great here, the rooms are large. But, is the resort fee of $30\/night justified, NO. It's also taxable. One reason for the long Checkin line, is a lack of staffing and the checkin time is 4P. Any Earlier has a Fee, unless you have a higher player card level. The line moves slowly per many times they don't have the room you booked. Plus, there's a lot of customers. Also a long walk to the Masquerade tower.

BEWARE OF THE 72HR CANCELLATION POLICY. Here's the issue. They state 72hrs (3 days), but it's actually 96hrs (4 days prior). Example; Arrival is Sept 10. You need to cancel on Sept 6, to get a deposit refund. Sept 7, is too late and you will lose your deposit. Rio, you are more than welcome to dispute this, and remember, you can't checkin until 4P. That's 2\/3 of a day lost. When you factor that in, it's really a 4 2\/3 days cancellation policy.

CAESARS or HARRAHS?. Unfortunately, many of the hotels\/casinos have merged. They were Harrahs, but decided to change their name to Caesars. Short history, Harrahs in Vegas was Holiday many yrs ago. then it became Harrahs. They were known for good values and customer service. Harrahs bought a bankrupt Caesars, and thought the whole chain was now Caesars. When corporations begin merging, that's when profits and margins rule the day. Sad.",3,0,1

Okay so first off I want to say, book your stay at The Rio. I say this because of he experience we had his evening at the restaurant. And I want to preface this with the fact that I am a manager at my job in the customer service industry.

We bought a 24 hour buffet pass today and at the point of sale were told that if we wanted to upgrade this evening to the seafood buffet, we could, for an additional $15. Which we were planning on doing because that's what we did this time last year during our stay.

But when we got to the register we were not only told that it was going to be an additional $25 to upgrade, but that they don't know who would have told us that it was $15 because it had been $25 for a while and that's just the way it was. 

There were three of us so that's an additional $30 more than we were expecting to pay for one meal. Now granted, $30 isn't a lot of money, especially in Vegas, but it's the principal right? You get told one price, that should be the price.

Once the manager found out what was going on he took very good care of us. Actually upgraded us to the VIP seating section and paid for the difference they were asking for at the register. All in all that's the most I can ask is if there is a mistake made, a business owns up to it and makes it right. We will be back next year.",3,0,1

Starting with a short (for LV) checkin line that takes 45 minutes.  A clerk at the counter who clearly doesn't like her job serves me and my group.  One reservation screwed up, not billing at the same rate as the others in my group, another 20 minutes and a manager escalation to fix it.

Reach the room, it's raining outside, and the window is leaking, Drip drip.  No rooms available to move.  The carpet wet. Don't walk on the carpet with bare feat either -- their black after a walk around the room.

Two days later someone else gets keys to my room!  They reset my key, not theirs.  I cant get in my room.  Luckily I knew the people, nothing stolen\/damaged.  Getting my key to work takes another day, their equipment doesn't work late at night to issue a key when I realize the key doesn't work.  Security takes 20 minutes to let me in my room.

In gets better:  my company sponsored a deck party at the pool, goes well, decent food.  Invitations have 12:00 as the shutdown time.  Security starts moving people out at 11.  At 11:30,  a man in a suit starts making threats to the guests and me up to and including calling the police to remove us (these are geeks, it's a tech event and the people aren't roudy - remember they think the event ends at midnight).  I complain.  The person yelling, is the security manager!  He tells me there are ""40 police officers outside"" and how his job is difficult and he doesn't care about my guests or my business.  $50k my company will never spend again at this hotel - a big investment for a party of this size in Vegas.

In fact, Tyler looked directly at us as if to call us towards his desk, then walked away behind the wall for about a minute.   
Then he came back and called us forward.  Wish we never dealt with this incompetent employee.
Right from the start, this worthless dude..Tyler made our lives miserable.  Tyler barely communicated with us except with his sarcasm.  All three rooms were supposed to be on the same floor, but Tyler barely responded to my questions.   It appears (so Tyler says) that he was trying to get hold of someone to put our rooms on the same floor.  But his telephone conversation, seemed more like a personal conversation and I didn't hear anything mentioned about rooms. I think that he went out of his way to...........
""NOT ACCOMMODATE OUR NEEDS.""  
And as for the $25.00 voucher that goes towards food and drinks. That Tyler shut me down on that.  Where did they get this guy???
Then Tyler said that the hotel is all booked out. But there wasn't that many people in the hotel. 
And also their parking lot was very empty as you can see in my photos. He also had me booked for a smoking room.  It took forever to explain to this inexperienced person that.......""HELLO DUDE...... I am ""NOT A SMOKER.""
I kept trying to tell Tyler I'm not a smoker,  but it didn't seem to register with his tiny little brain. . This guy didn't seem experienced at all on handling people. Absolutely no people skills whatsoever. 
So once upstairs I called the desk manager and the hotel manager and got the runaround. Bottom line...the hotel blamed Expedia and Expedia blamed the hotel. 
In reality there's nothing you can do once your booking has been charged then approved and you've checked in..
Also, they couldn't care less about my fall in there buffet area. I was walking to the seafood buffet to check it out to see if it was worth the extra $20. 
As I approached the Seafood Buffet entrance to talk to the girl who was checking people to see if they had a stamp on their hand , I went flying on the floor after stepping on something very slippery. 
As I got up I hit my head on the counter.  They made me fill out a  report on some piece of paper that didn't even look official.  They probably threw it in the trash can right after I left because no one from management contacted me about the incident.

But heres where it gets weird...if not creepy.
That buffet manager (less than 6 feet away) just kept smiling  and staring intensely at me. I asked him what he was staring at and he said he was waiting for security. Weird???
Once their security arrived, this same manager contradicted everything I had said in front of him to security and the EMT. 
 Even their own security told me not to pay attention to him.   Thank goodness that the people from my group were there to witness his irresponsible  non-professional statements. 
I told him that to go check out the cameras. They don't lie.

I made reservations at Rio for Fri-Sun and arrived late Friday night\/early Saturday morning at 3:30am. Upon arrival, I was told that our room had been given away because the reservation only held until 3am. This made absolutely no sense to me since I had already been charged $80 something to hold my spot for the room. There were about 2-3 other parties at the counter that this also happened to. The manager (Gia) claimed that all their rooms were booked for the night and that if she had a suite or a penthouse she would give it to me but she didn't, which I think was complete BS because the place was totally dead (which is unusual for Vegas hotels even at 3 in the morning).

So my friends and I left Rio and drove to the strip desperately looking for a place to stay. We went to Harrah's and explained our situation and what happened over at Rio and I am SO HAPPY we did. The lady at the counter was very apologetic (Rio and Harrah's are under the same umbrella) and accommodating. She even told us that, ""they're not supposed to give your room away if you reserved it."" Her and the manager ended up upgrading us to a top floor suite and lowered the price for us several times.

If you reserve a room with 2 beds. Its not guaranteed. You are only guaranteed a room and when you get there they see what they have. 
The good
Its an All Suite Hotel.

The Good
They are pretty big rooms. 
The Bad

- Room check in online was convenient. We walked right up to the keys counter and got our keys. However, it wasn't explained that we'd need another $100 to pay upfront. I figured they'd just charge my credit card. Nonetheless, it was quick and easy with online check in.
- Room was exactly what we paid for. Nothing more.

CONS:
- Room cleaning people were terrible. They didn't leave us fresh towels two days in a row, although they picked up the used ones, so we had ZERO towels.
- Pools - VERY DIRTY!!! Hot tub and pools were dirty with leaves and candy wrappers floating around. Lounge chairs hadn't been clean in a year. Nasty pool area.
- No one at the hotel even mention how to get around, a map or even that pool towels were complementary. We walked down with our room towels because there isn't even a guide for first timers in Las Vegas. This hotel was unfriendly and confusing.
- Food. VERY, VERY, VERY EXPENSIVE!! The Rio has not cheap eating except for a burger king by the parking garage. ALL the other hotels in vegas have food courts with several cheaper venues for eating. Even though we ate one nice expensive meal, we enjoyed paying regular blue collar prices the rest of our trip. We didn't eat at the Rio because everywhere else had cheaper food.
- Don't get suckered into the TIME SHARE garbage. They told us they'd give us cheap tickets to Cris Angel and the gondola ride and it would only take 2 hours of our time.  After 5 hours, I had to get a  little mad and loud and demand our tickets and a ride back to our hotel. They wasted our entire afternoon. If they'd have told us it was 5 hours up front, I would have just paid for the tickets to the show.  FYI: ALL THE HOTELS HAVE THE TIME SHARE SCAMMERS IN THEM, SO BE CAREFUL!!!!!!
- The RIO doesn't care if you're on your honeymoon.  We met severral people who were on theirs and their hotel gave them show tickets, free upgrades and other special things. The Rio doesn't care about honeymoons, so DONT STAY HERE if you're going on a honeymoon. Stay somewhere else that isn't owned by the Rio either. Remember MGM owns several hotels, Ceasars owns several hotel and others do too. Find out who owns the Rio and don't stay at their hotels for your honeymoon. They won't do anything to help make it magical. More like miserable.
TIPS:
 -We used Self-Parking, and if you do this, be prepared to walk about a miile to your room each way. It's completely on the other side of the Casino.  Since we drove everywhere, we still walked 9.2 miles in day one, 8.3 miles in day 2. Regardless if you drive or not, you'll be walking, and walking and walking and walking. 
- Don't get suckered into the TIME SHARE SCAM.  That's all it is, just a scam. They try to sell you $29,000 worth of time in a hotel, that's all. They dropped it all the way down to $5700 once we said no about 10 times. So you KNOW it's a scam if they go that far down.. No, we didn't buy it even at that price.
- GO TO BLUE  MAN GROUP!!  Greatest show we've ever been to.",1,1,0

Pros:
-Room service
-Room size
-Carnival world buffet
-Village seafood buffet

Cons:
-It was a non-holiday Sunday night and they gave me a room with a view of the trash can, 3 floors up, with no tub because it was handicap friendly. Apparently this was the only non-smoking king room they had left.
-Stains on the room furniture
- OLD tube tv (why don't you join us in the 21st century Rio, thanks)
-TV internet option SUCKED
-Location: This allows them to put a $15 table limit on games like black jack when other casinos on the strip have $5 tables just because they know a lot of their guests don't want to drive to the strip. BOO!

Working 12-14 hour days at a conference and not seeing outside, you notice everything.  Conference staff is attentive, flexible, and provides 5 star service although they do like to have their ""exclusive"" contractors that are a bit overpriced for the area.  The service makes up for the added cost.

Check in was a bit disappointing.  After a long flight and knowing my arrival time, they charged a premium to check in 1 hour early of $25.  Considering the amount of money being spent on the conference,  conference staff that needs to be checked in and working... should not have added fees.

Room cleanliness is a crap shoot.  I guess it depends on who is working that day.  One day, the room was spotless, the next... they didn't take out the trash, did not make the bed, and in fact never left fresh towels or replenish soap as requested.

Again considering the money the conference is spending, give me a break.  I am weighing the value of the service against the add on costs.

Main bar at the lobby  -great staff.  Relaxing to kick back and play a game with a cocktail.  Food is excellent, but on the pricey side. $5 for an 8 oz bottle of soda or water is a little over the top.

It was very affordable and the rooms are nice (all suites remember!) but it's definitely ""older"" Las Vegas. The casino is a little smoky and busy, but okay. They do a show on the weekends called the Show in the Sky where there's some dancing and singing followed by ""parade floats"" hanging from the ceiling that rotate around their track and throw out beads. They do it every hour on the hour between like 6pm and 11pm, Thurs-Sat I think. It's not a great show, but it is something to do while you're sitting at the bar or at a slot machine. 

The pool area is really nice and free. There are several pools and hot tub spas spaced around, with waterfalls and sandy beaches around the edge. There's also an adults only pool that costs to go into (we were quoted $20 for guys, free for girls), and says it's ""european style"". We didn't pay to go in, but my guess is that means girls can be topless because it's surrounded by pushes so that you can't see into the area. They have a DJ there that was playing some good music too. There are plenty of bars around the pool areas as well. 

The best part about the hotel is the fact that Penn & Teller are there. We got a coupon book with our stay that got us 2 for 1 tix, which is always worthwhile. Their show is awesome!

They have some good restaurants as well. I don't recommend the Dim Sum restaurant unless you're for trying something a little different, it's very traditional.

Customer service, lounges, conference areas, food provided during the conference. All excellent. Two Starbucks and the Hash House A Go Go all made me happy. 

The suites were nice. Very spacious and nicely decorated. Awesome bathroom space that was huge! Housekeeping was nice and unobtrusive so I appreciated that. A minor quibble being that they provide a keurig and they can provide k-cups, but you have to ask and they won't provide more if you don't. 

My biggest issue was the shuttle. Two different shuttles can take you to either Bally's or Harrah's. It's a first come, first board service... Except if you have a players card which allows you to board first. No big deal, expect the bus fills up fast. So if that players card person walks up right as the shuttle gets there, it doesn't matter that everyone else has been standing in the 100 degree heat for 30 minutes, they board first. That means you're possibly left waiting another 20-30 if you're unlucky enough to be at the back of the line. I know it shouldn't bother me because it's an awesome incentive for their hotel, but I found it irritating. Either have a second bus running to cut on our long or drop the card for the shuttle. It rubbed me so wrong. Not to mention the round about way the shuttle takes to get to Harrah's, you'd almost do better getting a cab.

Casino:  Okay, I'm not a gambler but their casino seems really outdated.  it just had an outdated vibe and fee.  They really need to do something about this to be competitive with the other hotels around.

We stayed here on a whim because we saw a cheap stay offered on groupon. We checked in an hour early for free. It was a quick process, but the woman that helped us (Bianca) looked like she hated her job. Smile a little! We also were charged a 32 dollar ""resort fee"" (which basically all hotels do now) that covered our wifi, gym use and local phone calls. Our room in the masquerade tower was spacious but pretty lack-luster. The beds were comfortable for the most part, and the AC worked great which was a bonus. We had a partial view of the strip, but mostly overlooked the residential areas to the west of the strip. 

The unfortunate thing was our bathtub did not drain quickly - I was afraid to take a decent shower for fear of the tub filling up. The sink faucets also leaked on the counters when turned on. The bathroom also had a weird window where people in the main room could look in to the shower. Not sure what the point of that is. 

 In addition to that, the walls are paper thing. We could hear our neighbors chatting and laughing for hours. Luckily we were only there for one night so we didn't have to put up with it for long. 

The groupon included a breakfast buffet for two which was a nice touch. Honestly that made the deal worth it, because buffets are so expensive in Vegas. The cooks were the some of the nicest staff I encountered in the entire hotel. The food was good too! I enjoyed the ""made to order"" pancakes they cooked for me. 

The Rio is located off the strip, but they offer a free shuttle to and from Harrahs and Ballys which was super convenient! Parking is also free which saves you a bit of cash. 

I'm not much of a gambler but I noticed that it was fairly quiet here compared to the casinos on the strip. That might be a bonus for some people who can't stand the big crowds. 

Overall it was good for a bargain, and a one night stay. If you're in Vegas for a longer period of time, or you have more money, other hotels would probably be a better option.",1,0,1

Restaurants in the hotel are pretty basic, there are 2 different Starbucks to keep traffic to a minimum - I have not stayed here, but I am here once a year for the national go-kart race that is in the parking lot each year -- which will be changing to a different location in 2015...

The main attraction for the Rio is the buffet which gets very crowded when there are larger conventions or events going on at the casino - to which I have not been impressed with the food all that much. The Casino can get smokey and is probably not the best place for kids

All in all - a cheaper off strip hotel probably one of the few originals that are left from the early 90's that came at the time right before the strip expanded past the mafia ran casinos that were torn down for what is there today.",1,0,0

I didn't stay at the Rio Hotel but my friends and I tried the Carnival Buffet. Holy smoking cowsaz! The line in this place was no joke! We decided to come way past lunch hour thinking we were smart.. boy! were we wrong! On the weekends they have brunch until 3:30ish for $25 (not including tax). We were waiting in line forever. We decided the fast track and add the extra $10. TRUST! it's worth it! especially when it's almost 3 pm and you partied like a rockstar the night before, like I did!

The food was great! They still had breakfast available PLUS mimosas! They had a great variety of food. From Mexican to Chinese to American to Japanese and salads. ooh and the endless crab legs and shrimp!!MmmMmm! The desserts were ahhhmazing! they had a gelato bar the served coconut, cookies n cream, mango, vanila, etc.! My friends and I came out of the Carnival Buffet with food babies!

We thought the group rate would be cheaper but it turns out we could've gotten the same room for $20 less per night which included WiFi when we booked 7 mos ago.  We upgraded by $20\/nite for a larger room in the Masquerade Tower and were disappointed.

1. No coffeemaker. They told us only rooms above floor 15 get coffeemakers when we checked in. They lied.  I texted a friend to get a room above floor 15, who was flying in the following day and when she arrived she got a much better room (smaller) but cleaner, remodeled, newer furniture but no coffee maker. She called to ask for one. The person on the phone told her she had to be in the room to deliver it. She went out with us and when she returned to the room, there was a roll out bed delivered to her room. She called and asked if there was a mistake and they intended to deliver the coffeemaker and they came and removed the bed.  On a 3rd call when she inquired about the coffeemaker again, the person on the phone told her they do not provide coffeemakers!  The woman on the phone even had the nerve to tell her that she could go to WalMart\/Walgreens and buy one for $10!  How rude!
Poor service.

2. Our room was large but the furniture was old and the bathroom was dated.  At least there was a safe, refrigerator. NO coffee maker.  Hubby is a addicted to coffee and they told him he could go downstairs to one of the 2 Starbucks to buy coffee!  Who wants to pay $4 for a cup of coffee everyday?  The front desk told us that ""no hotels provide coffeemakers!""  Having read other Yelp reviews, we brought K cups because they said there was a coffeemaker but no coffee.  We ended up lugging the K cups home.
We brought our electronics and was told us the service fee was $28\/night if we wanted to use our phones, WiFi or gym. So, we decided to not pay for that and ended up without use of our laptops for 5 nights!

3. The first night there, they had a water shut down and Hubby could not take a shower that evening.  He called and they said there would be no water until 6AM. He got upset and they said they would compensate with 2 bottles of water.  At 2 AM, someone knocked on our door and delivered 2 bottles 10 oz water. He only had enough water to brush his teeth and we couldn't believe it that they would knock at 2 AM to give us 2 bottles of water when they could have brought the water earlier.  He asked to speak to the manager and was given $30 hotel food credit the next day. 

At least the bed was comfortable.  The conference rooms are huge and ample. The meals (chicken dishes) served during the lunch symposium lecture were very good.  There is a small gym with a couple of treadmills and eliptical machine. They have a couple of large pools outside.  We had breakfast one AM at the Hash A Go Go restaurant downstairs and I went to the spa for a massage. The spa is very nice but expensive ($195 for a medium pressure 80 min. massage) but you can use the facilities (sauna, whirlpool, shower) all day if you paid for a service.  My massage therapist was very good.

The irony of all this is that we drove to Anaheim and stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn where service was impeccable and the rooms all had Keurig coffee makers with K cups even 'tho staff at the Rio try to misinform customers that hotels no longer provide coffee makers.

The restaurants here are mediocre at best.  Steaks at the All American Grill are decent and reasonably priced.  The World Carnival buffet which is usually the big hype of this hotel's dining has a lot of selections, but seems to have lost some of its luster compared to how things used to be.

The suite we had was nice enough - two queens and a large couch that serves well enough for an emergency bed.

FOOD
The restaurants lean towards standard fare - three separate bar and grill types, for instance.  Nothing wrong with any of the three, just not exciting, either.

GAMING
I only played craps when I wasn't playing poker - they had enough tables, but out of the six, there was only one team that seemed interested in entertaining.  

WORLD SERIES
They definitely keep making the setup better - more rooms with better table spacing, much better food options, more bathrooms.  There are more windows for sign-ups, but pre-registering and going through will-call is the way to go if you can manage it.

Some things can still get better:  the hallways are crazy during breaks and their over-flow tables were practically back in the casino.  That's a crappy experience for those who put up the money to play in the most popular poker events in the world.

The Goods:

1)Large spacious suites.  Each and every one of the rooms here are suites.  Marvelous!! During my first experience here, however, we had a little of an inconvenience and we were also in a much smaller room than anticipated- a king sized suite ( which was basically a large bedroom).  It was nice but our tub wouldn't drain.  After trying to get it fixed, we decided to ask the front desk for a different room so we could begin our Vegas vacation without any hassles.  Our next room was a double queen sized, which was MUCH larger.  We also stayed in one of the renovated floors during our second visit to Vegas, which we loved.  

2)The beds are comfortable and the sheets are clean. Housekeeping is really good about changing your sheets if you need them to. When we shared the room with two other people we still had ample space to breathe and stretch out.  

3)The addition of the second sink outside of the bathroom is awesome! As well as the large mirror, closet, and dresser.  That was awesome. 

4) And lastly....When you're dating a guy who's a total rewards member and some things get comped. Like a roll away bed for free.  Ya...that's always a good =) 

5)The pool is awesome. They have two DJ's and lots of drinks and food.  There are tons of pool chairs for you to lay out and relax and get your tan on too!

The Bads:

- Housekeeping takes awhile to pick up room service left outside of people's rooms.  perhaps they're short on staff, it just looks a little bad.
-Smoking.  There are some guests who were smoking in their rooms and outside by the elevators. *cough* *cough* *cough* Whenever I hear those commercials for  a smoke-free Vegas, I'm ALL down for that!! That's the one negative about the casinos in Vegas & clubs-- you & your clothes will come out smelling of smoke. Nasty!  
-loud music from the pool---not too bad for me, cuz i can fall asleep pretty easily, but I'm sure it was tough for some other people. 

Until Vegas becomes smoke-free, we'll still enjoy the fun stuff they have to offer.  The View from our room was beautiful at night!  I feel comfortable here at the Rio and I actually liked being off the strip.  They have a free shuttle that runs every 30 minutes to Bally's and harrah's so that's not too big of a problem.  We walked back a couple of times and believe  that's  a GOOD thing if you're buffet and dessert eating! Still haven't seen the show in the sky yet, so that's next on my list to do at the RIO!

During our check in process I was told my room wasn't ready and was currently being cleaned. They took my number and said they would call when ready and also would have my bags delivered. This is the same thing they told 99% of my coworkers. After several hours of waiting I checked back with them and guess what my room was still being cleaned. The room in the movie hangover wouldn't even take that long to clean. After our meetings our company informed us that now we have to go get our bags (if you can find them) and take them to the rooms  we don't have but should be ready. You guessed it I was told my room was still being cleaned! Enough is enough, where is the manager. She came out and basically said that when they say the room is being cleaned that just means not ready and they don't know when it will be. She offered a room with one bed and a pull out couch for two adults who might not even know each other to figure out. After explaining that is unacceptable she walked away then came back and said a room ""just opened up"". This place is a joke. I stood in line for over 30 mins to get an elevator and on day one they refused to let us use the stairs. You would think a hotel in Vegas could handle this. I have friends who at 9pm still didn't have rooms and eventually a lot of people got stuck in one bed rooms. The customer service here has been terrible and the food they serve is poor quality.

Rather than a long thin room with steps, the Rio has rooms that are w i d e. With full floor to ceiling windows. The Masquerade tower has the newer rooms and some better views. However, it's away from the main hall and the ""action."" The Ipanema tower is still a fine example of what a suite should look like - w i d e. I have stayed at the Venetian, Palazzo, and Encore which are all advertised as ""suites."" However, the are merely longer versions of a standard room with a stepped sitting area. Albeit, very nicely decorated, but I like the wideness of the Rio's rooms.

And, to get to the strip, they run a shuttle to both Paris and Harrah's every 30 minutes. Good idea if you want to hit the strip, enjoy the alcohol, and not worry about driving back. Yes, you could take a taxi, but I'm cheap, so a free shuttle is much better than a taxi that hits all the lights.",1,0,0

However, there were just some inconveniences with the room that makes me not want to be a returning customer. 

First of all, there is no switch for the room ""light."" Instead, the only light sources for the bedroom are some lamps by the bed, desk, and couch that requires manual power. If you need some decent light during the day, you're better off opening the curtains to let the sunshine in. Also, the TV is placed in a very weird position. It's not facing the couch nor the bed, it's actually placed off to the side by the wall in between the couch and the beds.

Although there is an option for you to pull the TV out from the cupboard and for you to swivel the TV around to face the bed or the couch ... it's quite inconvenient when you have people sitting on both the beds and the couch. The arrangement of the furniture is one thing that I did not like about this place.

Not only that, but I do believe that the hotel staff should better prepare their rooms for incoming customers. When we arrived, we found that there were not enough towels and the TV remote battery was dead. -.-

Another thing about this place are the elevators. Of course, I understand the Christmas rush of everyone coming in for the holidays, however I do believe that the staff should fix some of their elevators. This would only alleviate the elevator traffic that my boyfriend's family and I had to endure during our stay here. We had to wait for about 15-20 min for an elevator to not be full of people. And not only that, if you are lucky enough to get on one, be prepared to stop at EVERY SINGLE FLOOR since everyone is planning to get on the elevators.

But other than that, the rooms that we booked were pretty spacious with a pull-out couch, and housekeeping was nice. However, given the other 'cons' of the situation, I believe that I had much better stays at other hotels for either the same price if not more.

Happy Holidays. :)",1,1,1

Housekeeping took good care of the room, water pressure and temp was adequate, Room Service was odd: served on normal trays with takeout containers, once they brought a bottle of wine with no opener (we had one ;) Really no complaints, it was a pleasant stay. 

Was nice for me, as a former local, ""The Strip"" was never really my bag. It was definitely cheaper -- not sure by how much, I didn't pay -- there are decent restaurants, bars, and pools on property, I'd stay again on another visit.

1. The room; it is very spacious
2. It has a mini-refrigerator
3. Full-sized couch; side chair and table and chairs
4. Free parking for those of you who drove to Vegas (we flew)
5. Double sinks: one in the dressing area with a large vanity area and the other in the actual tub\/toilet area with smaller counter.

The Bad - they are making enough money on the rooms so why do these things.
1. No in-room coffee maker; instead you have to go to the Starbuck's downstairs; but they did have two paper cups for us.  I have to laugh at the paper cups.  Oh, please.  That's just plain TACKY!  
2. One-ply toilet paper; really?  I felt like I was being penalized for even using it.
3. $14 charge for internet use or the resort fee includes it.  Well, we weren't there to ""resort"".  We really were only in the room to sleep and clean-up and change clothes.
4. Mold on the bathroom floor and door area.  This shows that not enough care is taken when mopping the floors.

Now for the really UGLY

 Arrived Monday, March 6th with check-out on March 10th. Our men's and women's teams from our conference were using this hotel as it's ""home base"".  Our problem started on Wednesday when we received a knock on the door at about 9 AM.  It was the maid telling us she was there to clean our room as we had now been checked out of the hotel.  Needless to say, we both were surprised.    We were able to contact our Athletic Director and Deputy Director and let them know of our problem.  Turns out we weren't singled out for this behavior; they canceled the rooms for a number of the athletic staff.  We were asked to come downstairs to the front desk and it would all be straightened out.  We, did so.  We also received new key cards which let us back into the room.  We then went to our next game and came back  for evening functions.    We received a knock on the door and there were two security guards telling us we needed to vacate our room.  WHAT?  We took care of this earlier in the day.  Called down to the front desk and had a conversation with whomever.   The 2 security guards stood in our room for about 20 minutes and then escorted us downstairs where we happened to meet our Deputy Director of Athletics who also had been kicked out of his room.  Most of the athletic staff had meetings to go to the entire week--and now nowhere to stay?  I ended up handing over my personal credit card for $313 for one night.  I notice on their website that the prices are now down to a reasonable $86-$96\/night.  Big discrepancy, don't you think?.  I think that increasing your prices just because there is an event in town is usury not to mention greedy and money grubbing.  But, then again, all the hotels do it.  The public is at their mercy.

I was embarrassed to be escorted downstairs by two people in bright yellow jackets with SECURITY emblazoned on them like I was a common criminal.  It ended up with the front desk telling us we would now have to be re-escorted back to our rooms. You have got to be kidding me.  I cannot find my room by myself?    Security would then let us in and then give us new key cards (this is the 3rd set).  Fine, we are now further humiliated by this show of force.  They let us in and when we asked for our new key cards; they didn't have them.  They didn't know anything about them being the ones to give them to us.  So, another call to the front desk.  We will get them to you right away.  They NEVER did.  I called the front desk again and said, we have now been waiting for about 45 minutes and we have plans for dinner.  The response was;  you have to come downstairs and get them from us.  WHAT?   So, I went back down and got yet another set of key cards.  This time I left my friend in the room just to make sure we were not locked out of it.  
This problem could have been completely avoided had the hotel had their event manager onsite.  Instead, the clerk helping us had to keep walking into the back room to have a telephone conversation with this person.   Since I used to be the person who managed sales conventions for a multi-million dollar company and had the responsibility of arranging all travel, hotel, food-service as well as all the materials needed for presentations, I cannot imagine why this person was NOT onsite.  

Needless to say, I will never stay at the Rio again under any circumstances. I would rather pitch a tent out in the desert then to be subjected to the Rio's idea of service.",1,0,0

I've been to Vegas several times, I have never experienced the exceptional customer service, knowledgeable and friendly staff that I did on this recent trip.  I usually stay at Paris or the Venetian on the strip. I love Lights and excitement the strip offers.
This trip my BF wanted to see the Penn and Teller show, and since this was a 1 night trip we decided to stay at The Rio.  
We arrived at the hotel at Approximately 8:15 PM.  While checking in we got our tix to Penn & Teller and  considering we were checking in late, we ask for a late checkout.  Apparently the room we were in did not allow for a late checkout, The person helping us began Looking in to get us a different room. (Quick note: Late check out gives an extra hour).... We rushed up to the room so i could change for the show. Coming down the hallway we came up to double doors.  My bf opened the door and we entered a 2 story suite, With a marble entry, glass chandeliers, Expansive living room, separate dining room, (Capable of seating eight) A kitchen bar area, Bathroom, writing room and this is just the downstairs.  Upstairs was a walkway  that overlooked the living room, and led to a mini living room outside of the bedroom.  The bedroom had a 4 poster bed with pillow top mattress lots of fluffy pillows and wall to wall windows.  There was a entry hall that led to a closet equivalent to three of my walk in closet at home,  and a massive Double-sided bathroom with a Grecian style tub in the middle. Whew!  No I didn't want to leave the room! Damn just for a late check out request!
It's really set the precedence for our whole 24-hour stay. From there we headed to the Penn & Teller show.   Sadly this didn't work out quite as well for us, Getting there late the person that was to lead us to our seats (front row) Refused to take us down as people were already sitting in our seats and he did not want to disrupt the show or make them move. Paying top dollar for something and not getting it, left a little bit of a sour note but all is well we got a refund.

Next stop was the gaming tables I like "" let it ride"" and ""21,"". We were met by a dealer ""Lucy"". OMG this lady had such a great personality.  Seriously if you go to Vegas and you're losing money you need to have a dealer like this,  She was very engaging, funny and infectious.  As long as she was at the table we stayed at the table. Luckily we won.  Not a lot, but enough to make it fun and offset some of our cost.

The next experience At the Rio was At the world buffet.  It's renowned for having any type of food you could think of.  Personally I didn't find the food anything extraordinary.  Everything was lukewarm and I prefer my food hot, Actually I'm not a fan of any buffet.  What's stood out though was the service. We asked to be seated away from kids , Which pretty much put us into a secluded area at the buffet and Serving areas. The  Coffee server was prompt and when she brought us mimosas, I had asked for plain champagne, No sooner than she turned around she had two glasses of champagne to us. I couldn't even count the seconds!

Our stay was November 5 to the 10th. I paid $67 for the whole week. I gave 4 stars because this was our first time staying at this hotel and can't compare it to any previous stays there.

We flew in on the 4th and check-in isn't until 4 p.m. the next day.

I couldn't really complain, especially for $67. We still did have a view of the strip, though. (See attached photo). The couch was a little tattered on one corner. The drain in the shower was slow draining. One end of the towel rack on the shower door fell off when I hung a towel, but was easily fixed. TV is old school style. Still, I cannot complain. We were mostly happy with having a refrigerator and the room was clean. Housekeeping did a good job whenever we asked for room service. She even gave us extra shampoo and soap eventhough we weren't really using them. I ordered in-room breakfast and the man who served us was very nice. 

I would definately stay here again.",1,0,0

This year we stated at the Rio, in a Premium Samba Strip View room. If you've been reading my reviews you know I like me a deal :). I put a bid on priceline and Rio accepted. So we got this room for two nights at $200.00. The first thing we noticed was the entertainment center with the tv in the center of the window with a view. The way this room is designed it's not optimal for comfort. The only direct view to the strip is if you are sitting at the desk. And even then, the entrainment center blocks the view. The bed was not comfortable. It didn't have a comforter, just two sheets. The bathroom is small, almost claustrophobic. The door almost grazes the toilet, and I can actually reach the sink from the toilet. If I was taller I may be able to turn the shower on while sitting on the toilet. But there's one feature that really creeps me out...there is a small window that goes from the room into bathroom. Had I come with someone other than my fiance, it would make me uncomfortable that everyone could see me in the shower or on the toilet. I'll upload a photo for you to see. I would most definately not pay full price for this room. I got what I paid for but I wouldn't necessarily call it a deal. I will say their employees are friendly and their customer service is good, thats why I'm giving them 3 stars. But, I won't be staying here again.

Personally, I think the rooms accommodate groups on a budget well-- one room is made to sleep six (two beds and pull out couch) and there's a fridge you can use to chill your liqs and chase before a night of debauchery. Two sinks, lots of mirrors, spacious vanity area-- this solves the problems that me and my girls have had at Monte Carlo, Excalibur, and even the Venetian.  

Also, a big plus, since it's off the strip, your cab driver can take back roads while trying to get you to the clubs quickly. You don't get stuck in the traffic at night!

Seriously.  Check in at 4PM = waiting in line for 40 minutes.  Given that it was 4th of July weekend, I was expecting some delays.  But, there were only a handful of people ahead of us.  Turns out they had some sort of computer malfunction (which they told us 20 minutes in).  And yet, they had about 11 employees standing around, having lively conversations with each other and definitely avoiding eye contact with the ever growing line of hotel guests.

TAKE NOTE HOTEL MGMT: if you have some sort of computer malfunction and\/or delay, then 1) communicate this to your customer quickly and 2) for the love of PETE, don't have your employees just standing around in front of each station.   If necessary, have them go into the back.  Your customers may be more understanding if they think you're understaffed.

Other negatives:
1) paper thin walls. I'm talking RICE PAPER thin, son! We could hear every conversation, every cough, every moan (nicely done, 2 minute man) and every annoying door slam.

They also have a topless pool however all I saw entering was old men :(  
  The cons would be we had a room that joined the one next to us. The door in between wasn't quite flush to the ground so it sounded like our neighbors were in our room!

Lets start off with the rooms. Came here with a group of friends. In total we had 3 rooms. 2 out of the 3 rooms had to be changed because of this foul smell coming from the pipes in the bathroom. (every sink, shower, toilet smelled of sewage.. every time the water would run a FOUL smell would fill the entire room)..

Also, the doors on all three of the rooms did not lock properly. The deadbolt would stick making it seem like the door was shut but you can easily turn the handle to get back into your room without a key. 

We called front desk to sent up a worker to look at the bathroom about a couple of hours after we checked in. The worker walks up.. stands in the bathroom and says ""it doesn't smell that bad.."" and looks at us.. when we looked back at him like 'uhhh yes it does..' he then replies ""well they are cleaning out the pipes 2 floors down and that is where the smell is coming from.."" n he walks out.. NEVER even checking the sinks..

We leave and come back a couple of hours later to realized that our whole room smelled of rotten sewage. The smell is like an uncleaned fish tank.. its this awful, stale water smell.. we called front desk again and they finally sent someone up a hour later. by this time im pissed... the worker finally strolls in, we tell him about our door not working, the sinks how they gurgle and then give off a foul odor and what does he do? he pours an all organic natural drain-o in the sinks and then says ""oh problem solved"" then tinkers with the drain stopper, then goes to the door.. takes off the door handle and i kid u not, stands there opening and slamming the door for about 10 minutes. I SWEAR TO GOD, it was the most annoying sound in the world plus our room still smelled. By this time its 430AM.. We called the front desk at 1am. It has been over 3 hours since we called and then having a guy stand in our room thinking about what to do..

I was PISSED BUT I CALMLY told the guy that if he can't fix the problem then its ok.. its not his fault and that the front desk said they'll move us in the morning cause its 430am and hes still slamming the god dam door shut.

So while he was slamming the door, he deactivated our keys and DIDN'T TELL US. long story short, i went downstairs to meet up with some friends and realized iw as lokced out of my room at 5am.. fucking wonderful right? i go to the front desk to ask to speak to the manager. some asshole guy comes up to me (the mananger) and starts talking to me like I'm stupid. Saying shit like he doesn't owe me an apology cause of things I find wrong with the hotel, He kept saying shit like ""well, who do u think u are? and why should I care about what u think about my hotel?"" and its like WHAT THE F*CK are u serious?! he goes on and says ""i don't owe u anything.."" (I said well at least u can do is apologize).. he said ""ill reprogram the keys for u.."" and I get super mad and I just walk away..

I get up to my room.. to my surprise (NOT) the rooom keys STILL DONT WORK. By this time I'm super pissed at all of rio, the manager (antonio who works at night time), the maintence worker who was slamming my door shut for over 10 minutes and took an hour to get to my room,... for me still being locked out of my room.
.
ALSO to make things worst.. when i was talking to the worker in my room and trying to get him to leave so I can sleep, he called security on me (I was standing RIGHT THERE WHEN HE DID).. I was confronted by security asking if everything was ok. then the head of security apologized to me for the miscommunication (I WAS SOBER.. not freaking belligerent like the worker said I was)...

Front desk also, called me a liar to my face and said that securty was never called..

IF THEY WERE NEVER CALLED WHY DID THEY APOLOGIZE FOR CONFRONTING ME? 

all in all.. the only people who i give any credit too at this hotel are the security people. they do their jobs, when they were called they came super fast, they had the balls to apologize to me and I appreciate that. I do not appreciate how the manager treated me, how he talked to me and even after he treated me with such disrespect couldn't even fix the problem and atleast get us into the room.

at 630am.. a bell hop delivered the keys to my room. I finally went to sleep at 7am.. now u think with the time frame that this would sound like an amazing drunken night.. but no. horrible.. but it could of been a little easier if I was drunk.. next time I'll just bring a bottle with me so when I get locked out and talked down too by the hotel, I can at least be drunk and laughing..

oh wait im sorry, I forgot.. I'll never lay a foot in rio ever agian. I hope that this never happens to anyone ever. I felt so sick about how this guy was treating me. It was purely disrespectful, ignorant and downright rude and borderline sexist.",9,2,3

I like the fact that the Rio has decided to mix their VP lineup with some different machines.  I am generally not fond of the 'bevertainers' and I find it distracting--well sometimes it is.  It just depends if you know what I mean.

This is a casino I rarely play at unless I'm there for a show or to meet friends.  It tends to be loud, especially in the evenings, and the clientele is of a younger age.  Lots of drinking, yelling, high fiving and all the other things the youngsters do.",1,0,0

It's a tough thing to review a Hotel\/Casino.  When I review them, I have to remember not to review them based on my wins\/losses.  I also have to keep in mind that most of these hotels and casinos have a different vibe during the weekdays vs. the weekends.  

Regarding the hotel.  I've actually stayed in their rooms at least 20 times in the last 10 years.  Room are clean, spacious, and actually cheap.  Only issue with the rooms is check in and check out.  These lines can get long. 

Bars:  These get really full and on the weekends, tough to get a seat.  If you're a single, it's easy. If you're in a group, good luck.  However, service is always great.  Bartenders are always attentive.  I've never had a bad experience with them. 

Sports Book:  During game time, gets busy. I actually still prefers Red Rock's Sports Book and even South Point's.  Still a good sports book with good deli right next to it. 

Gaming (Tables and Slots):  I don't play slots so I wouldn't know, but my parents say they're tight.  I like playing Pai Gow and 3 Card Poker here mainly because their limits are usually low.  

Pool:  Small, but one of my favorite pools in Vegas.  

Poker Room:  During the WSOP, some good games out here.  You just need to know who is playing seriously and the ones that are here to just have a good time.  

Ambiance:  Definitely feel at home here because a lot of my peeps are here.  From patrons to employees, seems like everyone is a Niner Faithful.  For sure the Niner Empire is in full effect at the Rio.  

Not a strip casino, but close enough.  You get the best of both worlds in my opinion. After all these years, still one of my favorite hotel\/casinos in Las Vegas.  Doesn't hurt that they also offer local discounts at their restaurants.",4,2,1

Staying off the strip can be a bit of an issue, but they do run shuttles to Bally's and Harrah's every 20-30 minutes. I do wish they were a bit more frequent since it's inconvenient to wait so long in 110-degree heat, but it's a free shuttle, so I can't make too many complaints.

Anyway, the reason I was so delighted by Rio was that someone watching those black orbs with big brother cameras in them must have recognized my displeasure in losing quite a hefty sum of money. I was playing some Bonus Poker and a host came by and asked if I was who they thought I was and handed me some bonus comps including reward points and multipliers.

The access to everything 24\/7 is great, and that's my best love about Vegas in general.  The room was TOTALLY spacious - the biggest room I've ever stayed in for the best rate hands down.  They're not joking when they say ALL SUITES.

I didn't enjoy the LONG march from the hotel elevators to the conference center though - it seriously took 20 minutes when hoofing it down there.  But otherwise, the buffet there is great with excellent selection, the gaming is good & minimum bets are priced right, the abundant Starbucks are nice, but stay away from the Sao Paolo Cafe.  The American Grill is good & c'mon - Penn & Teller just rock.

I did get sick on this trip, which I firmly believe was the result of not stepping outside of the building for 5 days, so be sure to venture outside once in awhile even if you have no reason to.  The constant recirculated air with the cigarette smoke can be a lot to take.  

I did have issues getting the internet to work, but the staff was very nice in assisting me and ended up not even charging me for it since it was such a hassle and had to be renewed and reset every day I was there even though it wasn't supposed to work that way.  The key cards are a bit old, so do be careful when placing them near, oh, ANYTHING else in your purse or pockets since mine got de-magnetized at least twice, resulting in my sitting outside the door waiting for staff to come back up and let me in with a new key.

The front desk staff was always very nice whenever I needed anything, but beware that the laundry service won't wash something with vomit on it - don't ask, turbulent plane ride - but they will point you to a laundromat 2 blocks away.

It IS a pain to get to from the airport considering it's not on the strip - I think it took us a bit over an hour to get there on a Bell shuttle.  And getting back - forget it, we took a cab.  The shuttle service would only come at certain times to get you and it was like 4-5 hours before the flight, which was a total inconvenience.  The free shuttle to Bally's was good though in terms of exploring the rest of the strip for my husband who'd accompanied me & had never been to LV before.

Also, they don't serve Coke products.  Just fair warning for my fellow Coke lovers.",1,2,0

Check-In wasn't bad, line wasn't too long & it moved quickly (this was on a Friday around 1pm).

Casino needs more REGULAR Blackjack tables (they have a ton of the Single-Deck Blackjack tables, which, my boyfriend & I didn't know until this recent trip to the Rio, is played very differently from regular Blackjack).

Location is off the Strip, but they do have a free shuttle at the back of the hotel (by the entrance to their Carnival World Buffet) that brings you to either Harrah's or Bally's (I usually tipped the driver $1-$2 each trip, but otherwise there is no charge for the shuttle). Shuttle also runs from the morning til 1am, every 1\/2 hour.

In terms of quick bites to eat: Not too many options aside from the Starbucks, which almost always had a long line. They do have other eateries like the Sports Deli (food was decent & portions were big) & a few bars like McFadden's (food sucked here! Avoid at all costs!), but they weren't open in the morning when I wanted a quick breakfast en route to the day's activities.

Room itself was decently clean, but a bit outdated looking. TV was an older model, the ones that look like alien heads in the back, no flat screen.

1 BAD THING: The door to the room my boyfriend & I had wouldn't shut easily, so you had to slam it hard each time.

Since the place is a Harrah's property you can take a shuttle out back to any of the other property hotels which is a huge plus. If it's one of the 5 days the weather is nice in Las Vegas you can even easily walk to the Strip in 8-10 minutes and it has a sidewalk the whole distance. 

The rooms are all suites and amazing no matter where you wind up in the hotel. While the price falls similar to Strip hotels the Rio wins for me every time with quality and size. 

The added bonus is that the Rio always has great and entertaining stuff going on. Quality poker room, fantastic food selections (including what I feel is the best buffet in Vegas), and great pools just make this place a trifecta.

My room was clean, spacious & comfortable. What was strange was that, although there was plenty of hot water available for a shower, the water in the sink 5 feet away never got hot. And, I let it run for 10 solid minutes on both mornings! So much for a clean shave. 

I ate three meals in the hotel - one (the Hash House) was good while the others were marginal (Pho Da Nang noodles were way too greasy, All American Burger nothing to write home about).

What really bugged me was trying to get something to eat for breakfast (I don't do buffets). With the hundreds of convention folks staying at the hotel, the available options were simply overwhelmed. One morning at the Hash House, there was only one server working at 6:45 AM (a hour before my meetings began), though there were three hostesses standing around telling me that. Although there were plenty of open tables, no one was being seated. And the bar was completely occupied. I gave up, walked past two Starbucks with enormous lines, and ended up at a Burger King overlooking the casino. 

So, plan ahead if you're there for business. Being off the Strip, there really aren't any dining alternatives nearby.",2,1,1

To be brutally honest, I'm no fan of Las Vegas, and would not be here by choice.  LV is a dreary place that caters to that pedestrian herd known as Middle America, and the sundry middlebrow tastes and excesses of the same.  Not much fun unless you actually ENJOY surrounding yourself with fat, ill-dressed, drunken Neanderthals who stepped out of an episode of ""Jersey Shore"", or ""Here Comes Honey Boo-Boo"".   So I add as a disclaimer that I am mainly comparing this experience to my usual hotel haunts that aren't casinos.

THE GOOD: Lovely room for the price point.  Spacious and well-appointed, with nice granite-tiled bathroom and a nice deep tub (a real treat for those who prefer to spend their evenings soaking in a nice hot bath with a good book!).  The desk staff is very attentive and pleasant.

THE BAD: Extremely poor value for money, in my opinion.  The degree to which the Rio 'nickel-and-dimes' you for services that most quality hotels offer complimentary is downright disgraceful, considering the overall profitability of casinos.  Want wi-fi?  Pay up.  Coffee in the room?  They have those 'pod' coffeemakers, but charge you for pods used (I was able to avoid this particular indignity, as the aforementioned very friendly desk clerk upgraded me to a suite where they actually do comp you the coffee).  Want to print out your boarding pass for the flight home?  You have to pay to use the computer ($5 minimum, final fee based on time used)!  Thank goodness Alaska Airlines now sends boarding pass QR codes directly to your smartphone, so bite me, Rio!  How about a late checkout?  Well, normal checkout is 11am (??? In a hotel where you know most guests will be up late carousing?  It is a casino, after all, isn't that what most people at casinos DO?).  They'll push that back to noon if you ask, otherwise -- wait for it -- pay up, sleepyhead!

The Rio has a number of dining options, but frankly, I was underwhelmed by all the ones I had meals at (All-American Bar & Grill, Sao Paolo, Martorano's).  None were bad, but none were really memorable either, and horridly overpriced for what you were getting.  And beverages are heart-stoppingly spendy, unless you're gambling.  Also, the casino is not 'smoke free'; I'm going to have to use the few dollars I did win at the craps table to dryclean the smell out of my Italian suit!

One last tip: the hotel has two towers, the 'Ipanema', and the 'Masquerade' tower.  By all means attempt to secure a room in the former unless you are deaf, or don't plan on retiring for the night until after 3am.  The problem is that the 50-some-odd story Masquerade tower has the Voodoo restaurant and lounge on the top.  On a previous visit, I was astonished to find that I was being kept awake by the low-frequency bass vibrations from the club's sound system reverberating through the structure of the building, all the way to my room, which was 20 stories below (did I mention I'm a fairly heavy sleeper?)!!!  Fortunately this time around, I asked for a room in the Ipanema wing that would be 'as silent as an undiscovered tomb', and the wonderful desk staff delivered in spades.  I was able to retire at a sensible hour and sleep through the night until the next morning's convention activities.

So should you choose this casino over others at it's price point?  I honestly don't know; from reading other Yelpers reviews, I get the feeling that LV is no longer a real travel bargain.",5,1,1

I honestly don't mind the location, since we have a car. And I had a good impression of the room itself. 

BUT.

WHY DIDN'T ANYONE TELL ME THAT FAMILIES LIKE TO STAY HERE?! We were placed next to a family with a baby. And I knew that they had at least two children because one was screaming and crying nonstop throughout what felt like most of the night, and the other was just screaming. The walls are not very thick. That family might as well have been in the same room as us because it clearly made no difference. 

On top of that, the beds were not very comfortable (pillows are lumpy), and the sheets  have stains. If you feel icky about that, bring your own pillowcase and maybe some sheets. 

This is overall not a bad place. It's really cheap, and the rooms are big. However, since having a good night's sleep is important to me (even in Vegas), I don't want to stay here again unless I absolutely have to. With earplugs. And my own personal pillowcase. Maybe bring my own pillow.

They lied to me over the phone, guaranteeing a specific room type, then not providing that room type. Further, the 22-something ""supervisor"" essentially called me a liar because I could not provide a recording of the call and spoke to me in a very condescending manner.  They made no effort to fix their mistakes, and informed me if I wanted it switched the kind I reserved I would have to come tomorrow in a specific time frame that did not work with my meeting schedule.  I went through great lengths to be there at that time, and they took forever.  They finally put me in the correct room type--in a room with a broken toilet next to a room of Russians cursing loudly all night.  Security was called and did nothing.  Allegedly they sent someone to fix it the toilet, then ""left a message"" saying I would have to change rooms.  There was no message left and again they called me a liar despite that they could not pull up any message.  I had to change my room at 2am and the room they put me in smelled heavily of marijuana.  Their bell hop insisted he had to come into the room despite me being very uncomfortable granting an angry 50 year old man ranting about how he makes his money and union rules into my room.  When I brought it up with the front desk they dismissed my discomfort saying it was ""industry practice"" (it is NOT--in fact most hotels would prefer their employees not enter a room with a guest alone.)  Because I would not let the ""gentleman"" into my room after his aggressive response when I asked if I could load the cart myself and bring it out, I was refused any help with my bags.  When I checked out they refused to sign anything confirming no incidentals had been consumed, saying it was against policy.  Now I see additional and fraudulent charges on my bill.  The customer service at this hotel is the absolute worst I have ever encountered--in any country or hotel I have ever stayed at, including no stars, 1 star-5 star.  Look at other places to stay, and avoid the excruciating experience of dealing with condescending liars and fraudsters who try to cite ""industry practices"" and ""laws"" that do not exist.

We stayed here two nights because I found an awesome rate on priceline.com. It was 36 dollars a night and the total came out to be roughly 81 dollars for three people and two nights. The room was on the fourth floor of the Ipanema Tower and the view was definitely a 36 dollar view. We had two queen beds, a desk, tv, beautiful bathroom, and a couch. The room was in pristine condition and the beds smelled great (in case you're a rate by smell kind of person like me). The hotel is about a mile from the strip, which is not walkable in the crippling, triple-digit Las Vegas heat. But they have a FREE shuttle that takes you to either Harrah's or Bally's at Paris resorts, which are on the strip, every  15 minutes-ish. We kind of got lost trying to get from self-parking to our room because there are different towers, but I think all hotels are humongous and you'll get lost in all of them, but I would have hoped for a little more staff to direct us in the right direction. 

One of my goals in life was to see Penn & Teller and low and behold their home is the Rio which was very convenient. The show was amazing and I really enjoyed the comedy and the tricks they performed. Just make you sure you get your tickets for any show at Tix4Tonight located along the strip because tickets are half price there for most shows. We also saw the CIrque Du Soleil Viva Elvis show, also very entertaining eye candy in that one. 

The Carnival World Buffet at the Rio=Gargantuan and scrumptious. We paid about 45 dollars for three people because we got the discount voucher at Tix4Tonight. So much food variety, I can't explain how many options there are. I loved the sushi and the pastas. I am a sucker for dessert and the gelato and cake selection were heavenly at this buffet. 

All in all for the affordability and pleasure that the Rio offers to strip-goers (not strippers) is great. If you don't mind doing the shuttle thing to save some money, then please come to the Rio.

Our friends booked the suite for us months in advance as we were thought was supposed be in upgraded rooms . As for the price we were charged per night we should of had a penthouse suite. As the clerk Was not very personalable or welcoming at all said we could be upgraded for another outrageous charge! Mind you this was booked through a third party so We tried asking to speak with a manger and was basically escorted off to the side and waited and waited, no manager, back in now a longer line. So another attempt another clerk, AGAIN basically said they could only give us ""basic suites"" and for upgraded room we would have to be charged for an upgraded room! Well we just gave in as we were exhausted from flying all day. Asked if we wanted room service for another 40.00 dollars a night on top of the resort fee we already were charged for!! Just ridiculous and of course I opted to pay so I can have clean towels and room cleaned while on a mini vacation! 
        The ""upgraded room"" we had outrageously overpaid for was a room overlooking a rooftop with the fan turbines and a parking garage! Furniture was so old ,worn out, dirty stained looking, carpet was stained ( would not walk barefoot) just a very disappointing and to go down and asked for another room was going to be more of a hassle and from reading past reviews knew we could be placed in worse rooms and was happy it was not a smoky smelling room convinced ourselves again just be sleeping there and not in room all day.

We asked why is pool closing she replies because we are understaffed and she has school tomorrow!! That She is in High School! So basically we could not sit by the pool as none of us was going in the pool as the sun was down already and we just was relaxing there. All the pool bars closed down as well! We all were in disbelief!! Another disappointment!! 
        Casino is a big disappointment, needs updating! Played a few slots, some blackjack but just not a place where I would let more of my money be sucked into it! Definitely recommend elsewhere! 
        Here is just another reason I would not recommend this place... our friend was stuck  in the elevator on The 20th floor!!! Our rooms was on the 5th floor, apparently the elevator went straight up to the 20th floor without stopping! Finally did, waited a few sec. to see if door would open, nope! Presssed the emergency button , picked up the phone someone picked up and our friend told whomever on phone that he and two others were stuck on the elevator, the person hung up on him!! Attempted few times and finally was told Security was on way!! Waiting now our friend got frustrated and finally just tried pulling doors open manually to see where they were, he got the door opened and elevator was luckily stopped on the 20th floor where all 3 jumped out! Let's just say this ...what if someone had a medical problem on that elevator?? Getting hung up on a few times when seeking emergency help!! No words just unbelievable how horrible this hotel is!! 
     The night of the horrible shooting was our last night there and we opted to stay there and just play a few slots to hurry the night up as we returned to our rooms before the shooting started as we had an early flight Monday.  I can say we were not warned of anything to stay in our rooms, or not to go outside because could Not be safe! We got Nothing! No announcements!!

Since we went during the week, Vegas in general was pretty quiet and uncrowded too. This was great, since everywhere we went, the places weren't packed and we could take our time enjoying ourselves.

Overall, the Rio could use some renovations as far as new carpeting, paint, etc. But as far as service and quality of the food and amenities, we had no complaints whatsoever.",0,0,0

The bed was uncomfortable, the ""white"" sofa was dirty with some brown spots. I stayed at the Encore hotel it was great and my friend end up staying with me because her room was too nasty. The main reason I'm Writing this review is not because of the room( I guess you get what you pay for) but because in the casino they are people offering "" deals"" for a show. I'm disappointed and angry because Rio people did lie to us saying : ""you get the deal if you go in a tour that is about las Vegas shows so you can go back to your state and tell your friend and family about it"". It was a total lie they took us to "" The Grandview "" they gave us a tour of 4 hours( Rio people said the ""vegas show"" tour was going to be only 2.5 hours) . They worst part is that ""The Grandview""people tried to sell us a timeshare and they were extremely pushy and rude. I said i was not interested from the beginning and they just wouldn't stop being rude. This is the most awful experience in Las Vegas i ever had. I blame Rio because they lied to us about the tour.They never said I was going to be offered a timeshare by rude and uneducated ( Nick the salesman and Tyron Kyser, who is the manager)people who disrespected me just because I didn't want sign for a rip off deal.Every single person who was part of this scam was angry.

Unfortunately our stay this week has us concerned that Rio is going down hill. First complaint was there was no coffee pot in the room. There has always been coffee in the rooms at the Rio. We called the front desk to complain and they said they changed it and only some rooms have the coffee pot now. So now they want you to spend a fortune on coffee at Starbucks downstairs. 2nd complaint was the Buffett doesn't have breakfast on the weekdays anymore so we had to take the bus to flamingo to eat the breakfast Buffett cause we got the 24 hour Buffett ticket before knowing about this. Then we came back to Rio and the pool closed down. Next complaint is there were hardly any blackjack tables open the past two nights. Yes I know these are weekdays but there were a lot of people waiting for people to get up at the $10 and $15 tables. They only had a few open. Next complaint is the elevators are all mostly broke so it takes a very long time to catch an elevator downstairs. Today we checked out at 11am. With only two elevators working it took us over 30 minutes to get downstairs and that is only because we decided to go up first instead of down. Every time a elevator opened and going down it was already full with people.  The only way to get around that was to take elevator all the way up then back down. So with all this being said I don't think we will be staying at the Rio anymore.,0,0,0

Anyways, we used the conference rooms for the Trek events and they were spacious and the rooms had their own outlets every few feet - to charge phones and cameras! YAY!

Then when I told her I would like to pay the deposit in cash and that I needed to go to the arm to get it out she said ok and gave me everything back and told me to get back in line when I had the money. Instead of holding it and letting me run to the atm that was 5 feet away. So when I came back the room that I was going to get was gone and was given a handicapped room because ""that's all that was left in a king bed"". After going through all that the room had a nasty odom to it. Needless to say I was hardly in the room to stay away from the smell. Upon check out I was told that I ""took"" three things out of the mini bar which is hilarious since no one ever touches the mini bar because of the outrageous prices plus I was barley in the room because of the disgusting smell. Needless to say I had to argue about not taking anything from the mini bar so she would take the charges off. After all of that I handed the last my receipt that I paid in cash for the deposit in which she proceeded to hand me $104.00 because the woman that checked me in ""in error"" couldn't add and put the wrong number at the bottom but it clearly stated I gave $200 for the deposit and 56.00 for the resort fee.

Right off you realize a negative- it's off the strip :( I mean, if you like being off the strip, this is the place for you, but you have to pay for almost-at-the-strip prices. It was ~ $250 a night here. 

First thing, coming from the parking garage to the hotel lobby, you discover the Burger King Whopper Bar. Bar. Yes. Seriously. Then you have to go through slots and the table games and then hit the lobby around 5-10 minutes later, depending on your walking speed. Check in line took about 10 minutes, because there were a lot of people waiting in line on a Friday at 3.30pm. 

After checking in, we went up to the rooms [got 2 adjoining + door in middle that we unlocked to open access].. and the room looked spacious. There was a cabinet with a TV, a sofa [bed], a small table, a desk, 2 beds, and then the bathroom\/sink. What I found REALLY weird was that there was a sink in the bathroom... and then after the door separating, there's another sink. Why not build 2 sinks outside? Utterly confused. Iono. The shower is a source of water too? O_o Anyways pass this...

Going with the view from the tower that begins with an I... ipanema? You could see the strip buildings, the zipline from the other tower, and a lot of colors. We could also see the pool, which looked spacious and looked really comfortable to just soak away in 100+ degree heat. Downstairs, there's the sports bar where you can make your wagers, There's a bar where you can play Keno on the table and drink. There are a lot of tables and slots and pretty music and smoking as well!

They also have 'entertainment'. You wanna know what entertainment was? Gawking at pretty women attempting to sing dressed in skimpy clothing. Cuz Vegas. I will say that their singing didn't make my ears bleed (It was not really really off key)..it was ticks below decent. Cringeworthy? Iono.

Oh yeah if you want to stare at pretty women who are strip tease dancing or whatever that's even called... ugh I need to learn these terms. Um.. skimpier women dancing, there's are tables with women dressed sexily and a woman in the middle who decides to rock the single dance floor. If you like gawking that's for you [night only]

There also are two buffets here, a seafood buffet and the World Buffet, along with a dim sum place as well. That's about all I traversed through in the Rio.

There is a rooftop lounge, but I never really saw it.


Get drunk, look at pretty women, gamble. The Vegas way! Or is that life.....",6,6,6

Maybe I just had some better luck here but I managed to win a lot more at the slots here than just about anywhere else, more often too. The same goes for video poker, I won quite a bit there as well. I played probably 4 different slot machines and at least broke even on all but one. My luck with slots was way better here than just about anywhere else. 

The table staff are very friendly, and make for a fun environment. I played blackjack at three different tables, craps, and roulette, and every single dealer was exceptionally friendly and ran some fun tables where everyone felt comfortable. I noticed that many staff of other casinos are generally pretty quiet and don't exactly nurture an environment where people feel comfortable. This was definitely not the case with the Rio where I felt like I definitely am going to plan to come back to this place the next time I'm in Vegas. Despite all the other casinos on the strip we visited, this is the one I've been raving about to friends since I got back.

The people here mix some above average drinks, better than other table drinks at most places I'd say. My whiskey sours where great tasting (and had quite a kick to say the last). The waitresses are very friendly and attentive. Coolest thing ever, someone stops by with an iPad so you can see all the available options and not even 2 or 3 minutes later (without fail!) they bring you out your drink. I've found myself waiting for 10 minutes at some other casinos.

Moral of the story: If you want a great atmosphere, some great staff, and great drinks, this is the place to go. This casino was friendly and upscale, yet didn't have anything to prove like the other ones. It was comfortable and not too ostentatious. The people gambling there were also very friendly when compared to other casinos. I would highly recommend it for gambling if that's what you're here for. I can't really attest to the food as we didn't really eat anything substantial here, nor did we enjoy the nightlife or stay in the rooms. But if you want a great place to gamble, this is definitely it. I'll surely be returning next time I'm in Vegas.",1,0,0

I said I saw you pour well vodka and I specifically requested the Tito's drink. He said if he made it with Tito's it would be watered down. What? Then he said he could remake it with Tito's if he could find some. And then didn't bother looking. I asked why they have it on the menu if they're going to trick me into well vodka. He basically wanted me to leave and charged me for premium liquor and sent me on my way, disgusted and allergic to the drink he made me pay for.

  First off... I've visited the Rio prior to our stay and based on what the hotel looked like on the bottom I thought it would be a great alternative to the Palms Place (my favorite hotel but it was booked that weekend). WRONG! For the amount of money they charge for the ""suites"", resort fees and security deposit Blah blah blah, I expected much more. We stayed in the Masquerade tower finding the elevator to get to the tower was a challenge. As soon as the elevator doors opened on our floor the horrible stench of cigarettes and cigar smoke filled the air. The next thing I noticed was the filthy carpets in the hallway. The overall size of the suite was large but useless. The rooms are so outdated I didn't want to touch anything in them. The shower\/ tub combo looked like something from the 80's. 

  The only positive thing I can say is the beds were comfortable and they give you lots of pillows. I also liked the vanity area outside of the bathroom, perfect for doing makeup. I thought it was great that the hotel offered vending machines on each floor until I found out the price was $3.00\/each. Save your money and sanitary wipes, go to the Palms! 

  Also, in order to get a chair at the pool you have to pay either $25 or $45 even as a hotel guest. LOL",1,1,1

At the time, this was one of the top hotel\/suites to stay in along with the Palms. I loved everything about it. An awesome buffet, starbucks, gambling, clubbing ECT. 

8 years later the boyfriend and I return to stay here for a night. Welll actually we booked this for a ""napping place"" before heading home, but instead stayed an extra night in Vegas. The Rio does have some amazing deals on the weekday. If I can remember, it was $ 55.00 for a night. In addition, they do not charge a resort fee like the other hotels do, which makes it a hell of a deal. Make sure you have a Total Rewards card the more points on that baby that better you will be later on. However, with such a good deal comes the pit falls.......................

When we arrived, a tour bus just let off a bunch of international tourists who had just came in from the airport and were eager to start their own Vegas experience. So picture this, a full lobby swarming with adults, kids, and granny's all with their luggage waiting to check in. Since I am such an amazing girlfriend, I let Minh stand in line to check us in while I watched our stuff.

It seemed like the staff at the Rio was working double time to get everyone checked in and moving onto their rooms. It probably took Minh about 20mins or so to get everything squared away and we were off to our room.

Our suite was on the fourth room, okay not too bad. Highlights included:

-600 square feet of spaciousness

-Floor to ceiling windows. Our view was of the delivery area (awesome) at least we have curtains to cover that up!

-Lounge area (One chair and a couch that turns into a bed)

-25"" Television. You have to pull it out and twist it around to watch TV in bed. Make sure you push it back into the entertainment center otherwise; you will knock yourself out walking into it in the middle of the night. 

-Normal king size bed, with a down comforter and some flat pillows

Now the not so great things:

-Super paper-thin walls. They were so thin that we could hear our neighbor to the left of us sneeze and cough.

-The guest who stayed to the right of us setting the alarm clock and it going off while they were not in the room. We were woken up to the beeping of the clock, which went on for almost 2 hours before we figured it was the room to the right. Called the front desk who apologized and sent security right away to the room. Within 15seconds, all was quite again.

-While lying in bed talking the guest staying above us must have had either a pet or a small child staying in the room. As we kept hearing marbles rolling around the floor at all hours of the night.

-After coming back from having dinner with our friends and finally falling asleep around 4:45am I was woken up to the sounds of high heels clicking up and down the outside hallway. This went off and on for about an hour.

-Around 6:00am our neighbors above us have a heavy footstep and I honestly feared my life as the ceiling above our bed creaked and made scary sounds. All I kept thinking was I was going to see feet poking out of the ceiling pretty soon.

-Water pressure in the shower was horrible along with nonexistent hot water. 

-No free WIFI. It was a pay per day deal which kind of sucked!

11:00am was our check out time. Minh and I are not early morning people but we were eager to get the heck out of this hotel fast! We were pretty much zombies driving back home!",5,6,4

Too many nice places in the same $$ bracket to throw your money away on this has been.  First the rooms are just worn out and dirty.  From my bed I could see two french fries under the sofa.

It got so bad other single women in my area noticed it too.  The only way we could get a drink was to walk to the bar and pick it up ourselves.

The problem with these shows is that every show has different rules and the Rio nor the radio station promoting them let anyone know the changes until you get there.  The best example is my girlfriend is disabled and cannot sit on the hard ground.  The first 2 shows we went to there was lounge chair seating, the next show we were told we couldn't sit in the loungers, the next show after that we could, then couldn't.  Last month we tried to go and was told no seating but we could bring our own chair to use.  I asked security ""Any chair?"" and was told ""Yes"" but I know for a fact if we came back with just any chair they would not allow us to bring it in so we had to leave.  The other things they change is one show you can swim, the next you can't swim but you can use the jacuzzi, the next show both are off limits, the next show the pool is open again, what the heck?  And the last reason not to go is the alcohol, they offer an ""open bar"" which consists of 1 free drink of whatever they decide that night whether it be flat, warm, foamy beer or watered down who knows what.  The Fosters big can is the best deal but one show it is x ounces for x dollars, the next show the same can goes up 2 dollars, the next show the price goes back down but the can is smaller, the next show the price is higher for the smaller can.  Its been 3 years that I have been trying to attend these shows and nothing has changed in that time, still inconsistent and just plain wrong.

Of course this is where we stayed at during our weekend trip to vegas! I know there are a lot of people that prefer to stay on the strip and what not, but seriously staying just a little bit off the strip I have no problem with. Plus we had our room comped, so I wasn't complaining at all! Rio is a pretty big hotel, which also holds the biggest and to a lot of people the best buffet. 

I loved the Rio though, why because they seriously have like 4 tables right next to each other all three card poker! Of course vegas being vegas, during peak hours fri - sun all the tables are 10 dollars. I was itching to play three card poker the whole time, and so I tried it out on 10 dollar tables, and yeah it destroyed me! Our dealer was really funny, and very talkative, and that seriously makes table games fun! She told us to come during the morning, usually its not busy and tables are five dollars, so right away I set my alarm at 7am to make sure I am down here for those 5 dollar tables! 

The buffet here is seriously really huge, you can literally burn your first plate walking down the different options of food! You can get full, and just walk up and down looking at what to try next, and by the time you get your plate full..you will be hungry again, no joke!! Huge brownie points for having delicious crab legs!! 

I love that the Rio also has a show that is visible to the public. Usually consists of singing and dancing, and then after that these like huge boats and stuff circle around a certain part of the casino, and the louder your cheer for the dancers and what not, it rains rio necklaces! I scored me one, cause yeah I can cheer and yell pretty damn loud! 

Overall Rio is an awesome place to stay at, their rooms are pretty much suite's, they are all big and spacey. Again if you don't mind being off the strip, I think Rio is the best bet, awesome place to gamble, eat and of course drink!",4,2,2

My husband waited 1\/2 an hour for an available elevator but got frustrated along with some other hotel guests.  They went through the stairs only to get stuck at the first floor, (really?) locked exit doors on the first floor???

Then in our room, our 2 kids fell through sofa bed because the hotel neglected to fix the springs at the end of the bed. When brought to their attention, they said there's nothing they could do.  WTF?

My eldest son called Housekeeping and asked for extra blankets ...and the staff brought towels instead (duh?)

Then in the morning, the fridge shelf broke (hinge was rusty and couldn't connect) and all drinks fell down.  Shattered sticky glass was all over the floor.  They gave no further compensation for their horrible maintenance upkeep.  

The entire 9th floor hallway had no lampshades on the light fixtures. It looked awful and when you walk down the hallway, you get a bright light shined in your eyes.  We told the a so-called ""manager"" at the front desk (Jun-a short chubby Asian guy with an attitude). He said, ""Why change it?  People are only going to brake it anyway.""  WTF. I f@#*ing can't stand this place.  

We also tried to take a shower but drain didn't work first two days and the dirty water kept rising.

Second night, as I'm falling asleep to the sounds of a bass drum around 1am, there was suddenly a strong odor of sewage in the room. I found the source to be the bathroom and the technician came to take a look at it. The room REEKED and I requested to be moved. The front desk informed me that no rooms were available, which was a complete lie, especially since it was a Monday night during off-peak season. After expressing my disbelief, I was then told there was a room available but I would have to go to the front desk myself to speak with the manager. While this was happening I noticed a bug crawling on the bed and thankfully the maintenance technician was there to see it too. I explained the situation to the front desk again and I was told they would get in touch with the manager and abruptly hung up. 

The maintenance guy must have noticed my frustration and he was able to get the manager on the phone within seconds. Big props to him! 

The hotel manager was pleasant and informed me that I would be moved immediately. The bellman that was sent was incredibly cheerful, especially for it now being 2am.

I've loved staying at the Rio in the past, in fact I've stayed here 3 times this year, but this time was definitely different. It's unfortunate that the front desk staff, being the first point of contact, feels the need to lie to guests and be so incredibly combative.",5,1,1

We were recently there on a company trip to a convention that was hosted in the Rio, so it made sense to stay there. My coworker and I had a room on the 14th floor, facing away from the strip. We were lucky enough to see the erectile dysfunction, as well as bailbonds billboards every morning. 

As a whole, the hotel is not great. The hallways to rooms have torn wallpaper, the lighting fixtures have super ugly exposed screws, and the hot water in the showers can be gone as early as 7:30 in the morning. We were there for five days, the showers were all cold in the morning. How is this even a thing?

The room wasn't bad aside from that, but damn did this place feel dated. The staff were very nice, and there were plenty of places to stop and get whatever you need to make it through the day. 

The worst part about the hotel though, was the fact that you could not walk five feet without seeing another photo of Guy Fieri. The frosted tip douchebag, who everyone in my social circle thinks is a complete tool is absolutely everywhere, trying to get you to visit his shitty restaurant. He looks sweaty in all of the pictures, and it's just a general bad time.

My go-to casino is very close to the Rio, but I usually stay at the Palms or whatever hotel I can get the best deal at. And the deal I got at the Rio was pretty freakin amazing - $39\/night. And yes, that is on two WEEKEND nights. Although I am proud to say, that is not the cheapest I've paid for a Vegas hotel room. =) But for $39, that is a real steal for this hotel.

Like I said before, I'm very familiar with the Rio but I've never stayed here. So it was interesting experiencing the hotel from the other side. Let me start by saying that I received the best service I've ever had in Vegas at this hotel. And I'm not just saying that because they upgraded me when I asked, although that DID help. But from the housekeeping team that was there within TEN minutes of my calling them, to the friendly staff at the Carnival World Buffet who never stopped smiling despite seeing us three times in one day =X, to the bouncer and hostess at Voodoo Lounge who were WAY friendlier than any door ppl I'd encountered in LA. 

I could go on, but I'll spare you the details and just leave you with these highlights:

- NO RESORT FEE (this is HUGE..a stay at Treasure Island will now include a $20 fee on top of the room)
- Parking Garages on both sides of the hotel (saves you the trouble of walking allllllll the way through the casino to get to the rooms, i.e. PH or MGM)
- It's away from the strip which means NO STRIP TRAFFIC. which is why I always stay on this side of the 15
- Free shuttle service to Caeser's, Ballys\/Paris..saves you the hassle of driving and parking

So for those of you who are hating on the RIO, I say..you get what you pay for. And if you're lucky like me, you will get all that you pay for and THEN some. Thanks, RIO! Even though I dropped $$$ on the tables, you guys still made this trip a good one for me!!",0,0,0

It served as the host hotel for my convention, so I decided to stay solely based on convenience and access. Awful idea. Registration is an absolute nightmare. Ridiculous. The lines are so long and don't move quickly at all. My non-smoking room was smoky and not fresh. I immediately called to request a change and was informed they were sold out. A housekeeper came to ""deodorize"", which consisted of spraying a chemical on the floor. It didn't help. The hotel is also very old and needs major renovations. My furniture was outdated and ripped in a few places. The very random two way window in the bathroom shower with a view of the bedroom is a bit creepy. The first morning there was no hot water. Ugh. Very tepid water that never got hot in the shower. When I finally shifted rooms, it was an improvement, but still a mediocre experience. The room smelled much better and I could breathe, but the furniture and bathroom left much to be desired.  The room itself was very spacious. When trying to charge something to my room, I was told that my room charges were revoked. What? Why? So of course I was sent to the super long registration line. The guest services rep said she didn't know what happened but it should be fine now because she fixed it. Very inconvenient. I did have dinner at the Guy Fieri restaurant. It wasn't bad and they were pretty quick. Finally, the shuttle. Another nightmare. There is no organization, especially on the return trip from Harrahs. Guests are pushing and shoving.  Very chaotic.

Impanema Tower is a lot newer and bigger. They give you separate shampoo and conditioner but the Masquerade Tower gives you the 2 in 1 kind. Uh...I need to have soft hair. The Masquerade Tower has old sheets (I found a hole in our sheets), furniture and even TV. I mean...it's imcomparable.

Instead of checking in on Thursday, we checked in on Friday at about 12:30am. Unfortunately, they had no more rooms in the Ipanema Tower. Which is the tower that I preferred to stay in since the rooms are a bit newer and cleaner than the ones in the Masquerade Tower. They only had rooms available on the pet friendly floor which was located in the Masquerade Tower. So I was stuck with that room and even though I told them that my bf and I have very bad allergies to animal fur!!! They couldn't do anything to get us a different room.

So we were stuck there for one night and were informed that we can change rooms the following morning at 11am. But since I was going to head to the expo at 9:30am I wouldn't be able to do so. I asked them if they can just hold a room for us since we wont be back until late evening since the expo ends at 6pm. I was then told that the latest would be 7pm but then again with the traffic coming back to Rio from mandalay bay, I was not sure that we would make it back in time. So I asked if they can hold the room until 9pm and they couldn't do so. The latest was 7pm. GRRR..
I don't understand why they couldn't just hold a room for us since I made reservations or at least check me into a room without having me to be there physically! I could have picked up my card keys after I came back from the expo. But NO! because of this I had to leave the expo early and went back to Rio and check in then go back to the expo! what a waste of time! I have stayed at RIO many times during my stay in vegas but this will be my last time with them! It's about time they switch out their TVs to flat screens and have Pay-Per-View in their rooms. We wanted to watch the UFC 148 in our room by ordering PPV but they don't even have it!!!

Oh oh forgot to mention, I looked at my credit card statement today and noticed that Rio charged me an additional $200!! I was not sure why I was being charged an additional amount, but when I called Rio they said it was a deposit in case there were any damages done to the room. I thought this was strange as I never encountered any additional charges during my stay at Rio. But after talking to some friends, they did mention that the $200 deposit charge is probably because we stayed in a pet friendly room!

If you're  looking  for  safety... nope Dec.7  2014 police crime scene as soon as you get out of the elevator  in the morning. Wanna book your room in advance to save some money? Nope!! I paid close to $80 when I booked over 2 months in advance. Well if I would have waited I would have paid $45 at the desk. But that's not it there's an awesome $100 deposit and $25 per-night Resort fee!!! So what started as a $160 stay turned into $300 stay where it wasn't even safe to walk around in the Casino\/hotel. Sorry but this place is a pass honestly. You're better off finding somewhere else to stay.,2,0,0

There's a big couch and full size window which had a big, elegant view of the strip. Everything was clean except for the iron being in bad shape. I called to have it replaced and they had a new one in about 15 minutes. 

The casino is really fun because they hire very pretty girls for everything and dress them very sexy. Also there are two popular clubs there which bring in a lot of attractive girls. If you want a casino where you'll see lots of eye candy while you gamble this is the place. All the staff was friendly and one security guard I was talking to noticed I was way drunk.

We arrived to the Rio about an hour and a half before check in. The entire reservatuin area was unorganized chaos with patrons utilizing self help kiosks and two lines at the counter.  One of the lines was labeled ""keys and mail"" and we witnessed several people step out of the longer line we were in to get in that shorter line, and be serviced before us.  When we pointed this out and other people around us noticed as well, we appealed to the employees at the counter to police the line a bit better, and were essentially ignored. I guess if you want prompt service, cut the line...

Despite the fact there were about 6-10 employees behind the counter, it took quite a while to get through the line because half of them were either interacting with one another or had no sense of urgency.  When we finally got a rep, we questioned about early check in. The rep gleefully exclaimed that our room was available, but then told us it would be an extra  $30+ to access it 1.5 hours early.  I have never had a hotel not allow me in my room, if it was ready upon arrival, without fee. 

We opted to stow our bags with the Bell Hop, and went in search of food.  I had heard great things about Guy Fieri's restaurant but they weren't open til 4:30, so we opted for the American Grill instead.  I wish I remember the older lady's name who helped us, because she was extremely friendly...which apparently a rarity in this establishment. 

We paid extra for a premium suite, and while the room is spacious, it's still nothing spectacular. We weren't provided with sufficient towels\/wash cloths upon check in, and had a long wait for more.  I called the Bell Hop to have our luggage delivered, and they had written the wrong # of bags on our slip (saying we had 1 more than we actually did) and the guy on the phone proceeded to argue with me about how many bags we must have.  I finally convinced him to bring the pieces he had available (which actually was all we had) and at least they arrived quickly.

After settling in, we headed to the casino. My father had forgotten his TR card at home, and we went to get one reprinted.  Alfred at the counter was rude beyond words. He was snippy, dismissive, and not attentive.  We asked for cords for our cards and he waved us away and said ""we don't have those"" even though I had just seen another patron get one.  He had a tray of waters next to him that he apparently forgot to offer, and I asked if we could have waters.  He nonverbally set one in front of me.  I pointed out there were three of us at the counter and he slammed two more in the counter.  He didn't thank us or say you're welcome after we thanked him for the water he begrudgingly gave us. It was just a strange encounter and didnt add to the less than stellar first impression we had of the Rio.

We mostly play slots, and didnt find the selection at the Rio very appealing.  Payout was low and the cocktail waitresses were hard to flag down.  My dad did some gambling at night once we had returned to our hotel, but my mother and I mostly gambled elsewhere.

We finally got to eat at Guy Fieri's restaurant and the trash can nachos are a must!

Our first evening was the night of the terrifying and tragic Las Vegas mass shooting.  We had to take cover in another casino then after receiving the all clear to leave, we were able to catch the shuttle back to the Rio.  The whole shuttle ride was spent expressing fear and shock with the other patrons. Upon arrival back at the Rio, we were yelled at by ""security"" to show room keys to be able to enter.  There were people on the streets who couldn't access their hotels because of the crime scene and apparently the Rio woulednt let other people inside. Post shooting, we had to walk through 3 different hotels\/casinos on the strip and no other property disallowed entry to their property. 

The seafood buffet was much more expensive than other properties on the strip, so we did that for brunch at the Aria instead. 

The shuttle was fairly consistent, but did get crowded with long waits at times.  We opted to Uber in those situations.

The walls are thin and we heard music blaring from our neighbors all day and night long on the last 2 days of our trip.  After lack of sleep last night because of this, I called early this morning to request a late check out to give us a little more time to get everything together, especially since we're out on a red eye this evening.  The rep at the front desk let me know I could extend my checkout for an extra $25.  This too shocked me, because offering at least another hour complimentary is customary at any other hotel I've been at.  

All in all, the nickel and dime game of the Rio, coupled with the lack of stellar service, makes me question whether I'd stay here again or not.",0,0,0

My coworker and I got rooms across the hall from each other.  She says hers smelled funny.  I thought maybe it was because we were on the smoking floor but no, it did smell funny.  It smelled like a mixture of stale smoke and sewer.  As a matter of fact several parts of the casino had that sewer smell esp out by the shuttle area.  She tried it out and couldn't take it so asked for another room the next morning.  They said she would have to wait til 3pm when the rooms were cleaned but before 6pm before they get all checked out.  WTF???  so we couldn't go anywhere and that was our only free night. Then the room itself was pretty beat up that they seem to find acceptable.  While the AC worked well, it was extremely loud and noisy.  Not a hum but a rattling that kept waking me up when it would kick on.   My flat screen TV was visibly crooked with wires hanging all about. I tried to straighten it but it was stuck there crooked.  The lamp was cracking.  Furniture edges were worn\/chipped.  The shower has two vertical nozzles that 'once' had a cover and now its these two rubber things protruding from the wall.  Looked awful.   It is off the strip but they offer a shuttle to go to their sister properties on the strip Ballys or Harrahs.  Both properties are pretty far from the Luxor or Stratosphere.  The food here is very expensive if you just want a small bite to eat.  Even the burger king was pricey if you want to spend $7 for a whopper.   The only positive that this hotel has going for them is the size of the room is very spacious and the gaming had a decent variety.  I would never stay here voluntarily again.

We are in Vegas at least four times per year and like to try different hotels each time if possible. The Rio is a very nice hotel, well maintained but not the best or worst of Vegas. The value for money is outstanding.

The rooms are very large suites with excellent bathrooms. The showers have a glass window looking into the bedroom which is either sexy or disconcerting depending on your perspective (the latter for me). The bed was comfortable, the water pressure excellent, the view okay (over the suburbs of Vegas), service very good. In-room internet access was about the same as most Vegas hotels - $12 for 24 hours or something close. The rooms were a little noisy, we could hear people in the halls almost all the time but there is no street noise.

The hotel doesn't have the best restaurants in the city but the seafood buffet is good despite being pricey. RUB BBQ restaurant was awful.

If you are planning on being at a convention at the Rio this hotel is a perfect choice. If you're doing the tourist thing the distance from the strip may be annoying. It isn't a comfortable walking distance as the hotel is on the opposite side of the freeway. Cab fare is about $10 - $11 to get to the closer end of the strip (Treasure Island, Venetian, Wynn, Mirage, Paris hotels).

All in all, pretty good but not my favorite. With all the other choices available I probably wont stay at the Rio again unless we're attending a convention there.

Once 1PM came and no phone call, I called the supervisor's number for a status update. The supervisor on duty was Will. He checked in with housekeeping to see what was holding things up. He found out that there is a facilities issue with my room and that it is not available to rent out. So he transferred me to another room that was already available. We probably could have gotten a room around 11AM if someone found out that the room we were assigned can't be rented out.

The next day, we went out for lunch for a couple of hours and when we came back, our entire room reeked of cigarette smoke despite our room and floor being non-smoking. It made us sick, we didn't want our 1 year old to be exposed to that, and our poor dogs were in their kennel inside the room during the time. We had to wait out in the hall for an hour while I called the front desk to do something. They sent housekeeping to spray an air freshener spray, but that did nothing for the smell. They told us that there was no other rooms available for me, and that they could use an ozone machine, but we'd have to leave the room for a few hours. Well, the reason we came back to our room was to rest; our 1 year old was fussy and needed his nap. We also had event plans and reservations, so we didn't have the time to leave with our dogs for hours. After calling the supervisor again demanding they either put us in a different room or another room at a different hotel. The supervisor was able to book us a room in a different floor. So we rushed to pack up all of our things to be transferred to the new room. Which was a lot smaller and dirtier. There were cum stains on the couch, molding in the shower, stains in the bed sheets, dead smell from the bathroom, filthy carpet and just filthy everywhere else. We only had 30 mins to get to dinner so we didn't bother complaining again. I'll take a dirty room over a smokey room. Non of the dead bolts in either room worked, the hinge lock from the first room was missing screws and didn't close properly. In the last night we stayed, i had bed bug bites on my arm, see photo...luckily my son wasn't bit. We packed up our stuff right away and decided to check out early at 3 - 4am. 

When my husband tried to inform the manager on duty, Leilani Vasquez of our horrible stay she was as lackluster and inadequate of a person as the rest of the front desk staff. The entire time she did once take accountability of their terrible staff, but tried to make it our fault to cover their asses. She kept insisting we file an incident report of the bed bugs which only happened a few hours prior to when we checked out. And that we call house keeping. For what? more excuses and dirty sheets with cum stains on them? No thanks! Instead of trying to understand our situation and apologetic, she was rude (no proper training in hotel etiquette). The best she could do was remove the $20 early checkin fee which shouldn't be charged in the first place.

I called and filed a complaint with guest services and the general manager about our stay there and the terrible manager, Leilani Vasques. That didn't do anything. The guest service that recorded the complaint was also rude and lacked hotel etiquette, also placed blame on us. She reminded us that it is a huge hotel and it was a busy weekend, so house keeping service normally takes them longer. I told her again that this was not our first stay at a Las Vegas hotel! We stayed at a more classier, more expensive and much bigger busier hotel. The difference is that the bigger hotels on the strip actually give two shits about the people who stay there. They are fully train to deal with any situation. If she thinks the Rio is the largest hotel and the busiest as an excuse for the staffs incompetence, she is high as a kite. I've worked in a 5 star hotel for 4 years before. I know a lot about hotel etiquette. As far as the general manager goes, William Leslie was only able to comp $44.80 off our bill from the extra dog charge. He stated that the website listed a $75 daily charge for pet stay fee. SO WHERE DID THE $85 DAILY CHARGE COME FROM?! FALSE ADVERTISEMENT! They taxes on bs hidden charges for sure. The general manager said that was the best he could do. I filed a incident report, awaiting outcome.",5,0,0

I found a great deal online with Rio Hotel and Casino. I stayed there for two nights. The Hotel room was very roomy, although some of the stuff seems a little bit old. The customer service was decent. And also, the pool was very nice. There are three pools and two Jacuzzis. Compared to other hotels, Rio Hotel and Casino doesn't have much to offer besides a few things. I believe it's because it's one of the older hotels that's why it's different from the other ones near the strip. 

Overall, It was a great hotel but there is one big deal breaker during my stay at the Rio hotel. BED-F*CKING-BUGS. When I got home from the trip, there were bed bug bites all over my body. And it was very irritating, I could not sleep the night after my stay. I felt so disgusting. I don't think they ever change their covers so watch out.

I would post pictures after all the bug bites I got from sleeping at Rio, but it's so disgusting. Although the swelling did go down the next day, it was still hell dealing with that sh*t. I had rashes all over my shoulders, my arms, my legs, and especially my thighs. Never would I ever stay there again, their bed is f*cking disgusting and I hope no one else has to go through all that bed bug bites that I went through.

On August 20th, my family and I drove to Las Vegas for a short trip before my kids went back to school. We decided to stay at the Rio Hotel resort and Casino. While we were there, we had a great time. The pool was nice, the concierge was very professional and the Voodoo Zip-lining was amazing. 

As our trip was drawing to a near end, the last day we were there, we discussed extending our trip and staying the weekend. As we browsed the internet to check availability, my three year old daughter walks up to me and hands me an exposed needle. I quickly but carefully take the needle from her hand and ask if she was hurt by it and she reluctantly said no. I then proceeded to secure the item and checked my kids for any bruising or traces of blood. I ask my daughter where she got the needle and she told me it was in the couch. I couldn't believe a needle was in the crevasses of the couch in which my kids were playing on and jumping on. Keep in mind, we had already been staying there a few days and I thought to myself and said, ""If they missed a needle, what else could they have missed"". I began to search the rest of the room for anything else out of the ordinary.

I was infuriated and called the front desk to speak with a manager. I spoke with a manager and her name was Rosana. I explained to her what happened and expressed how upset we were with how irresponsible the cleaning staff was to miss something as dangerous as a needle. The manager apologized for the incident and we had to make a report of the incident however everyone involved acted like it wasn't a big deal. The supervisor that came to our room picked up the needle and walked out with it, no plastic baggie, nothing. Then another guy came to our room to collect the needle and we said it had already been taken care of. Then he came back a while later because he needed a report. It seemed that no one knew the proper procedures to take place for an incident like this and took about another hour and a half of our time while we were trying to leave. Considering the risk and that this is a safety issue and what could have happened, I would have thought they would try to be more apologetic or at least try to offer some type of compensation to try to earn my business back. 

It made me sick to my stomach to think that my kids could have been hurt or killed by this exposed needle. We don't know whose needle that was or what they did with it before it arrived as our roommate. We have decided to never stay at the Rio or any of its affiliates. Not to mention the large collection of dust and debris on top the TV stand and on the carpet that looked like it wasn't cleaned for an exceptionally long time, and no one acted like this needle thing was a big deal.

I really like this hotel because it is away from the Strip which gives you a little more privacy. The great thing is that because it is not on the Strip, it is typically cheaper! 

No complaints with the room or housekeeping. Everyone I spoke to, the casino tellers, waiters, concierge, front desk, and housekeepers were polite and very nice-- though that could also be because I looked like I was 15 years old...darn my height!!

However, I would say, as caution to the single female travelers, if a guy says hi to you, don't say hi back (unless you are looking for some fun...what goes on in Vegas, stays in Vegas, I suppose)! I was walking back to my room and a mid-20s guy greets me as I walk past him. I reply hi back, and then he says, ""Wait"", walks back to me, and says, ""Hey, so what are you doing tonight? If you are free, do you want to go back to my room and hook up, or I can treat you at the bar for drinks?""

When I went to check-in, the lady at reception said that I had 2 rooms with a King bed (uh, that's not right.) I showed her my receipts and said one of them was for 2 Queens. She asked if it were okay to switch that room to a 1 King instead, but we would get one of the renovated King Luxury Suites. 

She said one of the rooms was ready and gave us the key, but the second room was not and we should come back to the Key\/Mail line which would be shorter. Long story short, we came back at the time she told us and the room was STILL not ready. We finally got our keys at the end. 

I have to admit, our room was BIG and  roomy with desk, couch, coffee table. The bathroom even had a stool and vanity. The ""new design"" was ""groovy"". LOL. The room itself was not really my style. They didn't upgrade everything, mostly just the carpet, bedding and art. There was a tiny fridge underneath the T.V., but there was no coffee machine nor microwave. 

They didn't have a lot of good food choices inside the Rio. We ate at the buffet the first day and it was terrible. Not like how I remembered at all. The dim sum restaurant across from it would have been a better option. Oh well. 

The Rio also offers shuttle service to Bally's and Harrah's. We took the shuttle once to walk around the strip. 

The front desk informed us that we could go to Starbucks and were allowed $9.00 per person daily. We should just charge it back to our room and it would be no cost to us. Well, when we checked out 2 days later, I saw the Starbucks charges on my bill. We called the front desk and asked about it and they said that it was not included. *sigh!* I think they meant it for the OTHER room we book for my sister-in-law.

However it also depends on what ur situation is too. If u want strip life etc w\/relaxing sun bathing then Ballys or Plant Hollywood.  If u want strip life with a fun,friendly pool for adults n kids then Flamingo. And if u want a happy medium nice hugh clean affordable rooms but with in minutes of the strip Rio is the place 2b. 

Pros:
hassle free parking
comfy clean beds
clean room
wifi
LARGER than norm standard rooms
location (if u want off the strip\/but close to the strip)
affordable ;+) 
refrigerator incl.

Cons:
POOL HOURS  6am or 9am-6pm ;+(
Bcuz of the pool hours is why this hotel didn't get a 5 out of 5 stars from me. After we checked n and grabbed a bite to eat the pool was closed. However the signed posted read pool hours 6am-6pm. So before we checked out we got up early to get a 7am swim n the pool hours was changed to 9am-6pm. Being that the pool is a must for my fam n I we was very disappointed ;+(",2,0,0

I spent somewhere around $250 per night (it was the week of the Mayweather Pacquio fight so everything was packed and expensive). The room was spacious and clean- but a tad outdated- we had no problem with our accomodations- what we had a problem with was ILLNESS. Our first couple nights in Vegas were okay. On the second night we decided to eat in the Hotel Cafe. The food was overpriced and of very low quality. My burger looked like something out of one of those microwave dinners, and it was cold. My girlfriend's steak was rubbery and tasted like cheap meat (i work in a meat department for a living, i should know.) This wasn't the bust of our trip, though. 

The bust was when we decided to give the Rio's Buffet a chance on our last night there. We ate around 8PM. We left the buffet sometime around 9PM. We went back to our room to get ready to go clubbing and i started feeling queasy. Within the next hour i was lying down on the bathroom floor, hugging the toilet, vomiting uncontrollably, wondering when this hell would stop. It ended up not stopping all night. My girlfriend stayed up with me, feeding me ice chips to keep me hydrated because if i put anything into my stomach too fast it would send everything back out. By 1AM we realized that our night wasn't going to turn around so we called the Hotel Lobby to file a claim- i had either been poisoned by food poisoning, or the cooks of the buffet had cross-contaminated the dishes with shellfish (i am deathly intolerant to shellfish and i've experienced a similar experience when accidentally eating crab in the past.) A hotel security\/medic came to our room to assess the situation. He witnessed roughly an hour of this torture i endured. He sympathized for me, and begged my apology that the hotel lobby wouldn't let him bring me more than one tiny water bottle. I was the most sick that i had ever been in my life; after paying 750 for three nights, they couldn't sacrifice more than 12 ounces of water.

The guy left after writing the report, and i stayed up all night, moaning and groaning on the floor like Ripley from Alien, waiting for some extraterrestrial to pop out of my stomach... Seriously, it probably wouldn't have hurt any worse than my stomach felt those 12ish hours. The vomiting turned into diarrhea around 8 in the morning and we were able to check out of the hotel. I was told that i would be contacted by the Rio's claims department within two weeks. I wasn't. I kept calling the number i found online and getting the run around from everyone in that company. I finally got a call back sometime around August, or maybe September- saying that the claim had been processed and I'd recieve something in the mail.

You know what i got? Nothing. They told me there wasn't sufficient evidence to prove that the hotel made me sick. No apology. No X% of your next stay, no reimbursment for our last $250 night that was wasted with my face buried in a porcelain bowl... Absolutely zero.

I wish i had remembered to review the Rio much earlier. I would hate for anyone to have to experience the service that we received. Being 23, and having a LOT of friends that party and spend time in Vegas- i will be sure to make sure none of them EVER spend a dime at this resort.

That night, and the 5 hour drive back to San Diego, stopping a dozen times an hour to poo water- i will NEVER forget my experience here!",4,1,0

I brought my dog with me on a long road-trip with stop-overs in Vegas and there is only a handful of hotels that allow dogs. I actually would give 3 1\/2 stars but appears to be no half measures with Yelp. Sooo...

What I liked: Allows dogs. They allow them and allow us to be up farther than the 1st floor. Not much farther to the 4th but my room actually looked out  over the road and I could see the strip. They give amenities like bowls and a bag full of treats upon check in which is nice. Also on several occasions, staff offered me more individual treats when out walking him.

I didn't eat there except for BK so I can't review food. 

Did not like: As with all casinos, the smoke is overwhelming. And that reminds me, my pet-safe room was supposed to be non-smoking but someone must have been smoking in there for a while because the lingering smoky smell was powerful. Don't get in the way of Grannies and walkers because they will run your butt over. That said, it didn't appear to be any older than any other casino.

Myeh: Penn and Teller show is there. Nice theater with a good view of the stage but up in the mezz. section, you couldn't really see what was going on in the up close tricks and they don't project anything on screens so much is lost.

Liked: It appears that they are really chasing the younger crowd because there were lots of dancer tables with young women dancing, with a big set area by the masquerade tower. While I didn'to to Vegas for looking at that, my impression was that they were changing to keep it current but I'm not positive as I rarely go to Vegas (3rd time in my life). It had a good energy to it all

Myeh: location wasn't terrible but wasn't good if you're comparing it to the Strip. You're a free shuttle ride away to a central location so driving the strip at night is not necessary. Physically, you're approx 1\/2 mile or so so walking is an option. They don't allow dogs on the shuttle unless they are work dogs so leave the pooch at the hotel. Reviewing location is difficult but to me, this was better than Circus Circus because to walk the strip at night over a mile to get to the Bellagio to see the show is just nuts. 

Liked: The rates and room was great . Dogs get charged an extra $50 so for $94 and $80, I got a (seemingly) monstrous sized room of 600+ sqf. Bathroom is seperate (imagine a big room with a wall placed 2\/3 in the middle) but has a small window looking into the shower from the bedroom. Leading to the bathroom is an extra sink with fridge and closet with a safe. My cold water handle was leaking and there was no security latch on the room as it was broken but I forgot to mention this. Overall seemed clean.

Liked: back to dogs. The doggie relief area is actual grass out in front of the hotel. Other areas to walk are around present with bushes, trees and dirt. Compared to Imperial Palace and other Strip located dog friendly hotels, this place was a virtual oasis for the dog. I understand that space for parking is a premium and so on but if you put a pet-friendly hotel out there (Imperial Palace \/Harrahs) don't use fake grass and never clean it. No one likes it especially the dogs. Oh, and the room location to the dog area is good at Rio. Not so with the other places mentioned before.

That's enough. Eliminate smell of smoke better, and this place would be given more stars. The staff was friendly and helpful. Total rewards staff was great so use it...I would stay here again absolutely.",0,0,0

There was no bedding, the bathroom countertops were filthy and the floors were still wet and stained from trying to remove vomit. We called the front desk right away, and they said they would send a bellman up to check things out. 45 minutes later my boyfriend had to go to the front desk and get new keys for another room.

The second room was clean but smelled like a wood burning fireplace. We called the front desk again, and they said several people had complained and it was due to cleaning out some grills but would go away.

I'll start out with the positives first. The rooms were clean and spacious although when the Groupon deal said I would be getting a classic two queen bed suite I assumed it would come with a kitchenette and bar area which it did not. The rooms were really just slightly bigger versions of a standard two queen bedroom with a couch. However everything mostly was clean and well kept. The sheets were comfy and easy to fall asleep into and the bathroom sink was made with marble. There were two sinks one in the bathroom and one in the suite area which definitely made things more efficient. We also had drawers and plenty of closet space which was convenient. All of the staff was friendly and courteous and I never had any problems with them. Also, if you book the hotel through Groupon the $20 dine-in credit can be used at most restaurants in the hotel. And Wi-Fi at the hotel was surprisingly fast. It seems that you have to pay the ""Resort Fee"" if you want access to things like the Wi-Fi and gym but that was already stipulated in my Groupon so I didn't mind.

As for the negatives, there are definitely quite a few. Firstly, calling the front desk for help can be a pain in the ass. I don't know if it's because they are short-staffed or what but I tried calling more than once with a question and was put on indefinite hold multiple times while waiting for someone to answer. Secondly, our shower head was old and rusty which isn't something you want to see when you're about to take a shower. Third problem is the atrocious state of the hotel's jacuzzis. It honestly is no surprise that there was an outbreak of Legionnaire's disease here a few months ago given the poor status of the jacuzzis. When we went there were 5 jacuzzis but each and every one of them had a problem. One was completely broken, another did not have hot water, and two had no functional spa jets. The fifth jacuzzi was completely functional but once I stepped in I noticed what appeared to be vomit floating in the water and immediately stepped out. I informed the life guard of what was happening and he apologized but didn't offer to remedy the situation. For the price I was paying for my suite you'd think they would do something to address the situation. 

Fourth and worst aspect of this hotel is that it's not on the strip. Although you can see the strip from your room it's a 30 minute walk there and definitely not recommended in the summer heat. Also, although they have a free shuttle you can sign up for it only goes to Harrah's. Therefore we just decided to use Uber instead which was much more convenient. But I definitely wish I stayed on the strip so I could've walked to most places instead of having to take transportation every time. All in all the hotel is okay if you're getting a good deal from the Groupon and you're on a budget but when I go back I'll definitely stay at another location that's closer to the strip even if I have to pay more money.",4,0,0

First, I did not think our room was super clean when we arrrived, Our shower soap holder thing had a gaping jagged hole in the bottom that looked kind of dangerous. The shower curtain bar is not attached to the wall and falls down if you pull the curtain too hard. Ooops... 

The pool is really nice, but why are all the pools not heated? The one next to the ultra expensive cabanas should most definitely be the most toasty of them all since we were paying extra for our luxury style ovens to watch the World Cup game in. (Wrapping the cabanas up in tarps like a 100 degree present does not allow for any air flow. Every time I sat in there for more than 20 minutes I would get light headed). We also were not informed that the money we paid for the cabanas was a credit towards food. Boyfriend and I were eating leftover buffalo wings in the room when his mother calls us and informs us we have a thousand dollars that needs to be spent in only a few hours.

What was even more frustrating is we had ordered some drinks in the cabana and the waitress had brought us a bill to room charge it. Wth? If we have a thousand dollars of credit why did you not just deduct it? Jeez lady.

Our phone also did not work in the room, which we discovered when we wanted room service at 330 AM. Glad you have 24 hour room service, but if I cannot call it then what good does that do?

We were staying at the Rio for a week with a comped standard room, and after reading some of the reviews I was a little apprehensive about staying here...to the point that we reserved a room in another hotel for later in the week, in case things went sour. In the end, it was a very pleasant and enjoyable stay at the Rio!

We arrived near midnight and didn't have long to wait to check-in. Instead of the standard room we upgraded ourselves to one of the newly renovated Samba rooms in the Masqueraded tower. The room was very nice and very big. Two double beds, a couch, a safe, a minibar and a separate fridge (that came in very handy) and there's a window in the shower...it that looks onto the sleeping and sitting area...curious location for a window.

Anyways, we did stay for the whole week and cancelled the other hotel plans. The casino itself was fine and didn't reek of cigarette smoke. I found all staff members, regardless of their position to be very friendly and courteous. The cocktail waitress were lovely and came by frequently asking if we needed any beverages.


Pros
fast elevators to our floor.
hot, hot water for the shower and bath.
the shower head was an energy saver shower head, but it was still powerful.


Cons
our room had adjoining room via a locked door...very noisy when someone in the next room is standing near the adjoining door and talking.
noisy hallway...you will be wakened from your sleep with people talking in the hallway...glad I brought earplugs....although Ive experience this noise in other Vegas hotels.
if your a light sleeper you might hear highway traffic and railway train noise if your room faces the strip.
the TV is a nice modern Panasonic, but the signal to the TV in non high-definition and the setting on the TV has the images stretched from their original 4\/3 image to a 16\/9 image which could not be changed.
met other guests in the elevator, on two separate occasions, they were very unhappy with there rooms and were on their way to talk to the front desk.
Kleenex and toilet tissue are institutional quality.
The vending machine on our floor was charging $5 for a soft drink...really!?



Tips
walk over to the Gold Coast Hotel for inexpensive liquor and beer, but first sign up for a loyalty card at the Gold Coast and get 10% off you liquor and beer!
walk over to the Gold Coast to gamble, but beware, the cigarette smoke will sting your eyes!
cut through the Gold Coast and head over to the Palms Casino to gamble...it has a decent food court and an movie theatre too.
there's a small grocery store, Green Valley Grocery, located at the intersection of S Valley View Blvd and Twain Ave...its a 10 minute walk if you want to grab some snacks, juice, bottled water, milk, etc...but do not go there on foot after dark...I noticed few undesirables lurking about...there's also a Chevron, another 10 min walk at E Flamingo\/S Arville St.

Pros.
- Check-in took less than 10 minutes, and the front desk staff was friendly.
- Our room was spacious, with a table & 2 chairs, sofa and 1 lounge chair with ottoman. 
- Amenities included a safe and a refrigerator
- Room was clean.
- Free shuttle to several locations on the strip.

Cons.
- A lot of the furniture's wood was nicked.
- Some of the carpet seams were showing.
- Pillows were very uncomfortable. 
- Keurig Coffee is in the mini-bar and $8 for 3 cups! 
- $ 22 + Tax Resort fee covered Internet for one device, fitness center access for two people per day and all local calls. Yeah I know resort fees are ubiquitous, but I still don't like them - and as our room was comped, I think they should have been waived.

- Casino. The Rio used to be such a fun place when the masquerade shows were running, but now it's lost a lot its original appeal. While it has been renovated, we don't care for the selection or layout, so we usually spend our time across the street at the Gold Coast which has a much better selection of games, especially video poker.

Food. Like most Harrah's properties, the food is pricey.

You look fine to me."" Wow. Unbelievably disrespectful. Then when unasked for early check in, I was charged. Now I get that's policy, but we were spending 3 grand in this hotel for one night. We had 3 rooms, 8 tickets to Chippendales and bottle service at Voodoo. C'mon guys, comp the fee. 

The first room had outdated furniture that was literally falling apart. All the lamps were falling over and the desk was tilted. I was scared to put anything heavy on it. The second room had guests inside wheb we went in. Awkward. So they changed rooms to one that seemed overpowering of smoke, even though it was supposed to be a non-smoking room.

The lady even promised a view of the Bellagio water show which I'm not convinced you can see from any Rio rooms, but definitely not from this one.

The bathroom sink made a loud noise every time you turned the water off and the shower was HORRIBLE. The shower head only halfway worked and the rest of the water was still coming out of the faucet. It's completely dark inside the shower because there's no extra light and a dark shower curtain. 

The toiletries provided were a bar of soap, hand lotion and shampoo. No body wash, no hair conditioner. I get more when I stay at a Marriott hotel. C'mon Rio! Also the walls are paper thin. I could hear everything in the rooms next to me.

And then there's Voodoo. TERRIBLE club\/lounge whatever you wanna call it. The crowd was much older than we expected. The service was mediocre and the music was sub par. Not to mention they pulled the fire alarm TWICE to clear the dance floor. What a waste of money. Now this does not include the host Brandon. He was excellent. 

Pay an extra $50 and go to any other hotel near the strip.",0,0,0

We arrived about 2:30-3pm, parked on the 3rd floor of the parking garage and walked through the tower to check in, a cool walk since you see a ton of what they offer in the Rio. We had to wait in line for about 10 or so minutes to check-in, no biggie. We had a very nice woman check my husband and myself in (we are in mid\/late 20s). The world series of poker is going on there so there isn't a ton of availability but she did give us a few options--prior to arriving we requested the Ipanema tower and non smoking (those have been more recently updated). We went up to our room and were very pleasantly surprised. 

It was super clean, and a good size room. We checked our bed- no bed bugs, clean sheets, etc. Our bathroom was clean and amenities were provided. We were on the 5th floor and had an okay view, it was neat at night with the lights but you don't spend much time in your room so it doesn't matter if you have a super high floor too much. The coffee in the room does cost $ but we just ended up grabbing Starbucks downstairs each morning. 

A few tips and misconceptions I had prior to Vegas:
-They make everything cheap so you spend more on gambling. WRONG!
Everything is super expensive. Yes you can get a good deal on your room, but set aside more money than you think for food. The only time food is cheap is some of the breakfast buffets, but even lunch or dinner buffets are very expensive! Water bottles are super pricey too so bring some of your own water bottles and stick them in the second fridge in the bathroom area.

-If you even lift anything from the stocked mini bar, they will automatically charge you due to a weight sensor. We had to get a few things taken off but they were very nice about it. So remember there is a second fridge if you want to store things, but, don't lift anything in the mini bar unless you are buying something. 

-Play penny slots and get free drinks, tip the waitress a dollar. My husband and I weren't planning on gambling that much but we knew we would be drinking. Once we realized basic drinks were $9 and specialty were $12-$15, we quickly caught on that even if you are playing penny slots you get free drinks. So try your luck gambling and spend as much as you would on drinks. Or buy your own alcohol and take some shots in the room before you walk around.

-Across the street from the Rio there is a place called ""Golden Casino"". You can sit at the bar and play 0.25cents Blackjack and get free drinks even faster than at the Rio. You are always waiting for a server to walk by but at the Golden, the bartender is right there and you can get free drinks back to back to back. Also, it is way less smoky than the Rio- which gets pretty thick and we had to take breaks out of it.

-The pool at the rio is free for girls and guys. Only the back pool which is the topless one costs for guys- so, anyone who wrote it is $20 for guys---that's only one of their 3 huge pools. 

-We had the $6.99 golden casino breakfast buffet and it was decent, served its purpose. 

-The free shuttle from the rio to the strip is easy, comes frequently and so it's not a big deal to stay off the strip. We ate at the cheesecake factory in Caesar's Palace one night and had a ton of fun with our group there.

-Bellagio Fountains & Gardens are a fun free thing to check out. 

-2 nights is all you need unless you have a ton of money and can pay for expensive shows\/more food\/more gambling. I did wish we could've seen a show or two, that would've added to the experience but overall, we still had a super great time with our friends and family.",8,0,1

The shower looked pretty outdated and the water didn't drain very well... there was a small pool of water. There's a vanity area with an extra sink which is nice if someone's using the bathroom. On the last night of our stay, the water took a lot longer than usual to heat up.

The bed was so-so; it felt more bouncy than comfy. I saw a few holes in the sheets... not very impressive.

After a long day of activities we decided to order room service because we didn't want to go around and look for food, but we were told that it would be an HOUR wait... so we went to the All-American Cafe. The service was horrible. Our waitress disappeared after she brought out our food. Our water never got refilled... when she finally returned, we had to ask for more water. When she came back to fill our glasses, it took forever for her to come back again with our check. Meanwhile, there were at least 3 other groups of people who came and went... Too bad we didn't have that waiter.

I liked the Carnival World Buffet. It's supposed to be the largest buffet on the strip, but doesn't seem that big. The food was pretty good considering that most of it had probably been sitting out for a while.

The shuttle to the sister hotels was convenient since Rio is off the strip.

Few things appear to work ""right"" in this place. For example, the room had a wrong TV control, and when the ""good one"" was delivered three days later, the Pay Per View Services were disconnected.  It took several hours for a technician to connect the room TV to the Cable Services. 

The Wifi is not consistently works in the room.  The server was not accessible at 12 am, requiring more calls to the technical department.

The electronic keys to the room were ""keyed"" only for three days, prompting calls for the security and the front desk. If it was a trick by a bellman to get extra tips, or negligence by the reception clerk, I am not certain but it was very unpleasant. 

Moreover, the phone lines do not work. I was be placed on hold, for a several minutes more than ones, just to find myself disconnected. When the phone was answered by the outsourced operator, she said that the lines seem to be down. She told me to call 10 -15 minutes later.

The cleaning crew are slamming doors in the middle of the night, and early in the morning.

On the first day of the arrival, hotel guests were asked to leave the pool area, and it was boarded off, because of a private party.  People protested, but were forced to leave.  It was strange, and inappropriate, as the hotel charges $28 daily for the""resort"" fees. Upon the entrance of the spa area, which is the only way to access the gym, a young man, who works the desk, raised his voice demanding to sign his name down, prior permitting to inspect the gym. The tone of his voice was not acceptable, and he attempted to recover his grace by overcompensating with eagerness to help (later). 

I couldn't find coffee in the room. Apparently,  Rio charges fees for coffee pods ($9), which are stored in a mini bar.  Tea is only available through the room services (more tips and fees). The fees are charged pretty much for anything else, which is typically placed in a room ($3.24 to open a wine bottle that we purchased in  a lobby downstairs).  

I hope this is enough for readers to understand how poorly this business is managed. Hotel or service management, if it is present in this place, is not available via the phone, and must be seeing in person on the first floor.

The room was big. Enough for my husband, 2 teenage boys, and 2 under 10. Plenty of room with the 2 queen beds and a pull out sofa. For the price it wasn't bad, spacious, clean room. The pool were nice. More than one and the building provided shade in the afternoon. I requested linens for the sofa and they were brought up in 10 minutes. On our second day I had to return to the room after we had gone downstairs and when I returned, the housekeeper was tending to the room. I said hi and told her I was going to get something. Well, my husband had moved the bag to the closet and when she noticed my attempt to retrieve something quickly had failed and I was walking aimlessly, she nicely asked me to put my key card in the door.

We were there for what was supposed to be a special occasion. This is definitely not my first foray into a casino. I've been to Vegas plenty of times, almost exclusively to Harrah's properties. My mother, a Diamond Club Total Rewards Member, arranged our stay as a gift for us through her casino host at Caesar's in Atlantic City, sight unseen. The Paris hotel was full that weekend, but we were assured that the Rio was just as faaaaabulous. If you're an Atlantic City person, you'll understand this reference: The Rio is about as fabulous as The Claridge.

Valet: We arrived at 11 p.m. on a Thursday to a check in situation that left us sitting in our motionless vehicle for a good 45 minutes before we decided to take it upon ourselves to move our luggage ourselves. When one of the valets saw us ""stealing"" a luggage cart, he decided to stop talking to girls in the taxi stand line and help us the other 2 feet inside. 

Check In: Worse than Thanksgiving weekend airport security, ruder than TSA. We waited in the longest line I have ever seen at any casino check in. Naturally, we were overjoyed when our room turned out to be on the lucky 13th floor. REALLY...they have a 13th floor...in Las Vegas. We brushed it off until we got inside because again, our ""suite"" was supposedly fabulous. Maybe 19 years ago it was fabulous, but not anymore.

Room #1: All I wanted to do when we arrived was take a bath, get a bite to eat, and go to bed. Our room was not the most modern, but we could deal with that. I'd still have to say the least appealing aspect of our room was the creepy, peep show window into the bathroom. Seriously, who wants to watch their suite-mate sit on the toilet?  The fact that the room was not clean was a deal breaker. Idea #1 was nixed as soon as I saw our filthy bathtub. The previous guest must have been a coal miner with the black ring around the inside of the tub. Then we noticed the broken light bulbs still in the sockets around the mirror and the broken doorbell. I was looking at the carpet and said out loud 'Ohhh I should vacuum.' before I caught myself and thought 'Vacuum?! I'm in a hotel!' When I called to request a change of room, the broken phone cord actually fell out of the phone. We finally got through to the front desk manager  who told us to tell the bellman that we were moving to a room on the 29th floor when he arrived with our luggage. The bellman would let us in, then someone would be up to the new room with a key shortly. 

Room #2: The new room was cleaner and a little more modern, but still with the creepy peep-show window onto the toilet. We waited 45 minutes for our new key to arrive before we decided to call the front desk again about the key because we were starving and it was now almost 2 a.m. Besides, if a key card takes almost an hour, how long would it be before we saw room service? We ventured down the the bloody awful and messy Whopper Bar, our only option, and ate our food amidst some low rent prostitutes resting their feet and catching naps.

Back to the front desk again, it's now 3 a.m. and the line is even longer than when we arrived. I ended up walking up to the side of the counter and asking to speak with a manager. The clerk refuses to let me speak with the manager and then calls up a guest while I'm standing there who yells at me for getting in front of him on the line. The clerk actually goes to get the manager when I yelled back. Manager shows up with 2 keys for our now second room. Total time for check in: 4 hours. Another 20 minute wait for the elevator and we are finally in our room and in bed. 

We stayed a total of 2 nights, and with the exception of sleeping, spent as little time as possible in The Rio. We hit the buffet once because a friend of ours said that it was awesome when she lived in Vegas 5 years ago. It so wasn't. We didn't bother to drop a dime in the casino either. Any time in casinos or restaurants was spent at other Harrah's properties over on the strip. The Rio (or The Favela) sure left a bad taste in our mouths, and it wasn't just that Whopper.",9,10,7

Annoyingly enough, when I called down to the front desk to inform them of what happened, their response was ""you're not supposed to be in that room, you're supposed to be in the room next door, we have no one listed in the room you're currently in"", trying to make me feel like I had made the mistake. I get it, you're surprised, but the key cards your hotel supervisor  gave us had the room# (the one ""I wasn't supposed to be in"") written on the envelope they give you with the key cards. Went to the casino, came back - key cards worked. Went to the buffet, came back - key cards worked. I don't get it, if I wasn't supposed to be in that room, why was I in and out of that room for 6 hours before this stranger was booked in the same room? They even made me try my key on that room next door but of course it didn't work. THEN they had the audacity to ask me if I could pack up all my stuff and move to the room that ""I'm supposed to be in according to their system"". Seriously? You guys messed up and want to inconvenience me EVEN MORE? 

Oh, and I just read on Twitter that a guest was burglarized in their room whle sleeping, the police report read that there was no forced entry... starting to believe this situation wasn't an accident or mistake at all.

My positive review however is all about the people here. The front desk lady who checked me in was very pleasant. The waitresses, card dealers, floor bosses, and bartenders here are very personable and fun. Even the other players at the tables make this place a fun spot to stay and play at. All very friendly and social. Drinks are stiff and easy to get everywhere. Lots of gaming choices and space to move around although their slot machines were pretty tight.

It was a conjoined room (suite), and I had the room with the king-sized bed all to myself. The room includes a sectional sofa, tube t.v., a Jack & Jill sink, & a typical shower\/bathroom. The reason why I gave it a 3.5, is because the pictures from the t.v. fluctuated between black and white, and then to color.  And the floors needed to be vacuumed, or at least underneath the bed.

Bed: 5\/5
So COMFORTABLE.  Not too stiff or too soft, just the right amount of firmness to give you support, yet cradles the body.

Extras: 5\/5
I love that they give you a mini fridge, that kept my water and left-overs nicely chilled.  There's also an ironing board and iron; good for last minute presses.  Hairdrier (standard), and a single cup coffee maker (coffee is, of course comes with a fee).

The Rio is simply an over priced average hotel, who's trying to squeeze every
penny out of you.

So far I've stayed at the Excalibur (ick!), Monte Carlo, Luxor (tower rooms ONLY), Flamingo (GO rooms are AWESOME!!), and now the Rio. Part of my stay was comped (3 out of the 4 nights we stayed) but that doesn't sway my opinion of the place. Yes, the rooms are BIG. Beds are oh so comfortable. The pillows are lacking but I've had worse. You get 2 fridges in the room (one's a mini-bar but the other is empty for your own stuff). We liked the bathroom. Spacious for 2 people to get ready at one time. The shower\/tub combo is average. Tub isn't large enough for the average adult to bathe in (typical). The shower had great water pressure and there was ample space to put  your shower necessities which was nice - no fumbling. View was of partial-strip - what I expected. Rooms could use an update. The bench at the end of the bed was a bit crusty - they really need to get rid of these. Having the extra seating in the room (sofa, chair, desk with 2 upright chairs were nice and allowed us to hang in the room at times without feeling cramped). 

This hotel is not on the strip. No airport\/hotel shuttle, which they SHOULD have since they are not a Strip hotel. Cab fare was reasonable from the airport - $25 to get there and around $18 back (I believe there was traffic on the way there). We did use the free hotel shuttle to their strip properties (Ballys and Harrahs) and took a cab back to the hotel (this was because we didn't want to wait in the heat of August for them). The cab back to the hotel ran about $10-$15 (depending where we left from). 

The casino is okay. We didn't ""win"" but we did play a LONG time on what we did put in. We didn't fare any better at any of the strip casinos either. Cocktail service at the Rio was AWESOME. We never had any problems or a long wait any of the 4 nights we were there. Yes, the entertainment (show in the sky, the servers who dance\/sing) is WAY lame. Felt we were at the America's Got (some) Talent Casino. They really need to stop with the singing and dancing. No one stops and watches it except for the pervy men who gawk at  the dancers and then don't tip them when they're finished. I just don't see the point of this. 

I do have A LOT to say about the food during our stay, but those are separate reviews.

Overall, I like the Rio. I will stay again but only if they give me a good deal (future comp?). I'd rather stay on the strip and have the convenience of other restaurants and the option to run to Walgreens for cheap soda and snacks (Rio wanted $3.95!! for a single soda in their store).

The Federal Trade Commission and the Better Business Bureau are starting to receive more complaints about these deceptive business practices. If we continue to complain they will put an end to these ""drip pricing"" practices.
Copy and paste my sample letter below and complain. It's easy, you can do it online.

""I booked a two night stay at the Rio All-Suites Hotel & Casino, 3700 W. Flamingo Road, Las Vegas Nevada, 89103, telephone number 866-746-7671 (""Rio"").  The total cost was $233.52 ($104.25\/night) that included tax and fees. 
Upon check out I was charged an additional $50.00 on my credit card without my authorization.  The clerk at the Rio told me it was a ""resort Fee"".  I didn't learn about the additional fees until I checked out at the hotel, after I made an online reservation for what I thought was the full price.
When I booked the hotel room online (through Expedia), I expect that the rate I saw was the rate I would pay.  My printed receipt said ""Paid in full"".  I did not agree to pay additional fees upon check out.
Knowing about extra fees lets me compare rates for different hotels fairly. Had I known about the additional hidden charges up front, I would not have booked this hotel.  By providing a deceptively low estimate of what I could expect to pay for their hotel room, I booked the Rio and it turned out to be much more expensive. These are unauthorized credit card charges.
I feel this is unfair business practice and needs to be addressed and stopped.

Smelled like Sh!t. Seriously..  Good thing our friend had room deodorizer in her possession, which we're still wondering why.

I'm a regular at the Wynn, Encore and Palazzo but we got this room Comped so we took advantage of it and accepted it as...well.... Comped. The wall decors looked like they've been renovated but most everything else was out dated. The couch, carpet and drapery were typical 90's. The restroom was very basic. Nothing to brag about. There's no luxurious feel whatsoever but then again, it's not the theme. The plumbing for the two sinks need some work. I can hear the gurgling every time one of them is used. Wifi was not complementary and the TV channels were very limited. The outlets were broken. I mean the wall socket plastic cover was shattered revealing the inner walls and the actual socket was loose. When I tried to plug my phone charger to it, it turned off the alarm clock.

I stayed here this past week for a conference (along with several other colleagues) and it definitely ruined my Vegas experience.

I stayed one night at the MGM grand before I arrived, and as soon as I took a cab across the highway away from the strip ($8 to cross a highway??-that's another topic) I had a bad feeling about the place. 

Upon entering the room, I had the reflexive instinct to pick up the phone and call the front desk to see what the cost would be to cancel my reservations. $50. In retrospect, a small price that I should have paid, but didn't unfortunately.

The reason I came to the Rio (aside from being onsite for the conference) was because I was really excited to go swimming. The pools were promoted on the website as being fabulous, so that sold me. When I got there, the pools had been closed for the winter. Argh. When we asked the front desk manager about the swimming elsewhere in the 'city' he told us we could get into the Paris or Caesar's pool at no charge. Wish they would have told us that sooner. 

Anyway--I like to be concise, so I'll wrap it up. I'm just going to list off some of the 'highlights'---
vomit in the casino not cleaned up, banged up furniture and the worst bed & bed clothes I've ever seen in a hotel, a shower faucet that sprayed water over the top of the shower curtain and onto the bathroom floor at random, late night patrons of the bar taking it upon themselves to provide their own version of a peep show, tiny and crowded gym that I used for $22, off the strip location, and the list goes on and on.

I wish I would have checked out and stayed elsewhere.. there is no way that this place should have cost $175 a night. I could have stayed at the MGM grand for that price-- which, in comparison to Rio is the lap of luxury.

I'll leave you with this Rio Tag Line. The interpretation is up to you. 

The Rio: ""Exotic, Uninhibited. Fun.'",1,1,0

During our most recent trip we went to a couple of shows here and in previous trips we visited their seafood buffet. They are currently running The Eddie Griffin Experience and Penn & Teller. Rio, unlike some of the neighboring hotels, draws a larger crowd from the strip for its food and entertainment. 

They have an all you can eat seafood buffet that we tried last year on my husband's birthday. The buffet was good and perhaps even worth the $50 pp price tag. We played a few slots here, but didn't win anything. We mainly hang out here usually waiting for a show or food, which means that Rio is doing something right to draw in the crowds. As for the decor, they have a festival, Mardi Gras thing going on here. The casino clearly hasn't been remodeled in recent years and looks out of date compared to some of the newer ones on the strip. What it does provide is a relaxed atmosphere. It also has some cheap gift shops and a Burger King located in the main atrium. I would not advise making a special trip here without plans as there is not much to see. If you like seafood or any of the entertainment options, it's not a bad property to hang out at in the meantime.",5,1,2

I really liked the rooms  as they were  clean, large and had a separate a vanity area. The rooms come with a refrigerator but no coffee maker. I wasn't too impressed with the bedding. The pillows were horrible and there were really no blankets on the bed only sheets.

My only real complaint  comes from an unfortunate circumstances these past two days. On Wednesday night we were detained out of our room on the 21st floor due to a small fire on floor above. Now I understand the hotel can't foresee these circumstances and thank God everyone was okay, but their mode of communication was ineffective. Anytime we asked the staff members for information, they were rude and unhelpful. But later on we were allowed to go back up to our room and all was well. However at 6 a.m. the next morning the fire alarm went off on our floor (21st floor) followed by an announcement on the speakers that everything was okay and not to be alarmed. My boyfriend and I decided to open the door to see what was going on in the hallway and the 21st floor was completely full of smoke. Scary feeling, so we decided to take the stairwell down 21 floors and evacuate. They didn't evacuate the 21st floor until later.  We were kept out of our rooms from 6am till 4pm.  Anytime we asked questions we couldn't get answers. They had such a poor emergency response to a reported electrical malfunction on the 21st floor. They put us in the showroom with water, but we never really got any answers from them letting us know what happened and what was going on. About 2:30 p.m. they told us they were relocating guests to a different hotel and get in line for the letter at registration. The line at registration took over an hour, then we were escorted back up to our room on the 21st floor via the stairwell to pack all our stuff and carry all our stuff down 21 floors again. Again, I understand the hotel has no control of what had happened. My major complaint was how poorly they handled this crisis. They had no systems in place to work with the guests. We kept asking and getting conflicting answers. Being pulled out of bed at 6 a.m. with just the clothes on your back was very scary. We finally got changed to the Flamingo and got back in a new room about 5:30 p.m. We had a whole day wasted on Wednesday. Now they did give us free buffet tickets and gave us the last night free.  But Rio really needs to work on customer relations in regards to crisis situations as such. They need to set up a command post where you can get answers from and regular updates on what is going on. Around 9 a.m. several of us heard the fire chief tell the hotel staff that they should start relocating the guests, but for some reason the hotel didn't.  If they would have relocated us then, then we would have recouped some of our day.   I will never stay at the Rio Hotel again, just for the pure fact that I don't feel safe. I know they're an older hotel but they really need to invest in a crisis plan for when something like this happens. It's highly unacceptable to tell people that everything's under control when the entire hallway is filled with smoke (not just a little bit, but completely filled with smoke). I think corporate really needs to come down and look at everything. New systems and procedures need to be put in place effective immediately.  This is just an opinion as a guest.  If they explained  everything, I think they would have had less angry guests.  Communication is key in any crisis situation.",1,0,0

Casino reviews are tough anyway, but it's even more challenging when reviewing a place connected with a life experience.

We stayed in a Masquerade Suite. Those are the large endcap suites in the taller of the two towers. The suite is around 1500sf, and has floor to ceiling windows that wrap around 180 degrees. From the dining area, past the living area, through the bedroom, and all the way to the jacuzzi tub, you get a view that includes both the Strip and the mountains.

The view is to die for, especially on a higher floor.

The furnishings are dated, and pretty worn. You will find frayed edges all over every chair. You will find gouges in the wooden frames of chairs, even some pieces missing. The bed is comfortable, but certainly not top-notch.

Check-in can be annoying, unless you are at least Platinum with Total Rewards (the shared players club with Harrah's, Caesar's, Paris, etc). Platinum status is worth next to nothing in most parts of the country. But it's very useful at the Rio. Skipping the long checkin line is great.

Guest services was friendly. I have no complaints there. But there were the typical number of glitches. 

Overall I would give the place 3.5, but I am rounding down. There just isn't enough ""wow"" factor for that 4th star. Because while many things at the Rio are awesome (great buffets, great rooftop lounge), those are items I can review separately, and those are items you don't have to be staying here to enjoy. You can stay somewhere else and then visit for a few hours.

They offer a free shuttle that goes between The Rio and strip hotels which runs on a regular basis throughout the day. 

The rooms are good sized and well kept. I've enjoyed staying in both towers. 

The casino and hotel's amenities are all good. The food at the buffets is very good as are the servers and buffet attendants. The casino floor's and breakfast restaurants leave something to be desired in taste and quality of the food. The service in the restaurants is also fair at best. The most disappointing thing I have found staying at the Rio is the short dining hours. After 10:00 pm there is only the restaurant on the casino floor to eat at and I've just commented on that.

My favorite thing about this hotel & casino is the staff. The casino staff and the hotel staff (check-in and housekeeping) are very friendly and professional. I felt most welcomed by the staff here compared to any of the other Las Vegas hotels that I've stayed at.

The trip before this one, the guy at VIP checkin was very eager to help, gave me the number to call for any assistance, and later that day, I had a letter under my door about how he was happy to help, VIP assistance number, etc, etc..  Anyways, that trip, nothing went wrong so I didn't have to look for that number.  However, this last trip was a disaster.  Yes I did VIP checkin again, but didn't receive a number at the beginning, and the letter came the next day.  Right after check-in, came to the room and the safe was already locked!  The phone in the room took a while to figure out (no front desk or concierge button----you have to push a different button and get transferred or later I found out just push 0).  Took two phone calls and 2-3 hours to get someone to open the safe.


The worst part of the trip was that I was checked out without me knowing!! I tried to use my reward credits\/etc at the host to help cover my bill, but I was already checked out!!!!  The very rude lady at checkout was no help.  I explained that I didn't check out and wanted to know how it was possible that I was already checked-out???  I probably got the worst response... ""DO YOU WANT TO CHECK BACK IN???""  I tried to explain it again.....and got the exact same response from her.  After figuring out that she wouldn't be of any help I just left and accepted the full price bill.

Not the most amazing of hotels or casinos, I will say that. You'll find flashier, newer, and more dazzling on the strip, of course. But our room was clean and a welcome respite after the shock of the Tropicana, which I suppose wasn't saying much, so I'll say this: it's a normal, nice-but-not-luxurious hotel room. Decor was fairly modern, if simple. 

We had some difficulties with the front desk: key cards kept screwing up, and the front desk line is always like forever-and-a-day long. But they always brought towels up when we asked (we asked a few times!), and room service was prompt. 

I did have a run-in with one of the valets, when I needed to catch my friends who I had JUST let out of my car. They were headed up to the room and I was going to go park, but had given them the wrong key. I moved my car out of the main overhang area, jumped out, and the valet started shouting bloody-murder about how he needed my keys. I ran inside anyway, gave the room key to my friends, and when I returned to my car about 1.5 mins later, the valet was still standing in front of my car, giving me the evil eye. He then asked ""What my problem was."" I told him to go park a car or something and left. It was just weird and overbearing. I suppose he deals with Vegas d'bags all the time, but it's not like I left my car there for an hour and a half, right? And considering that I saw the same cache of cars sitting in that area the entire three days I was there, I didn't think it was that big of a deal to jump out for a minute and a half.

-Our room was away from the elevators and mostly quiet. Could hear some doors opening and closing.
-15th floor = cool view of the strip
-Good customer service... I didn't realize there would be a resort fee because we were not told until check out time. I talked to the manager which said it was probably in the terms&conditions when we booked, probably true. Either way he only charged for one of the two resort fees ($20\/$40) so that was nice. 
-Penn&Teller show is located there.
-Affordable prices for rooms.
-Room was pretty large, two queen beds and a sectional couch in there. We also had a mini fridge which was great.
-Close enough to the strip that cabs to get there are cheap.
-Complimentary shuttle to Paris and some other places.

Cons:
-Long check in line... eek!

The hotel has a casino floor (standard, nothing too extravagant), restaurants and buffets, a pool (ehh, could be better), and a shuttle that runs every 30 mins to take you to the strip.

Reports of dirty rooms, poor customer service, poor plumbing and shoddy service had me wondering if we'd made the right choice. Below are the good and bad that led to our 3 star review:

Good: (4 stars from me)
1- Spacious room. I was thrilled with the size of the room and the fact that we had a sofa. I wouldn't really call the room a ""suite"" but it was three times the size of the Hampton Inn room that we'd stayed in at the beginning of our trip.
2- Clean room. The sheets were fresh and the towels were bright white. Yes, it was a little shabby and showed it's age, but the digs were clean, including the shower, which functioned perfectly.
3- Friendly, attentive staff- Requests for extra towels and pillows were responded to quickly and with a smile.
4- Two sinks- one in with the toilet\/shower and a second in the vanity\/dressing area. This is great when traveling with a group of 4- we were able to shower\/get dressed\/primp in tandem.
5- The Indian restaurant- the buffet was very reasonably priced at $15 and we were able to take the food to go. My son even went back for more naan and it was provided at no charge.
6- Pool area- this was good for the family and we were easily able to get chaises within sight of the pool we were using.
7. ""Free"" wifi for two computers in the room (see #5 below for the downside.)

Bad: (deduction of one star)
1- The bed- it was very firm, which can be a good thing, but after three nights, my back was killing me. This is, of course, a personal preference thing, but it was enough of an issue, combined with those below, to warrant a star deduction.
2- Drink Prices at the pool- For one beer and two small bottles of water, we paid $15. Larger bottles of water in the gift shop were $3 each (which was comparable to what we found on the strip) so the cost of pool-side drinks seemed disproportionately high. Obviously, after that round, we learned to bring our own water bottles with us, but that's the only ""outside food or beverage"" they allow, so if you want a beer, be prepared to pay the price at the pool!
3- Carnival Buffet- There was a tremendous variety of food, but with the hefty price tag of $30 each was quite a reach for a family of 4. We went for brunch at 11am and much of the food was already dried out from sitting on the line.  It was NOT worth the price, and we would not do it again.
4- List of restaurants\/menu availability. We saw signs for the Hash House restaurant, but never actually came across it. Our room had a book\/guide with, what appeared to be, a room service menu and the list of restaurants, but it provided neither menus for those restaurants nor directions\/location for us to go find them. We were all over that hotel during our three day stay and I cannot tell you where the Hash House restaurant is located. I don't recall seeing it. Our breakfast options were the pricey buffet or deep fried Burger King (blech.) If you're not big breakfast people, stop at a convenience store and pick up cereal\/milk and save your money for lunch\/dinner at the restaurants.
5- ""free"" wifi for two computers in the room, which would re-set daily (so with 3 laptops, we would have rotated.) This is problematic in that if two laptops were connected on  one day, they automatically connected when they were opened the following day, leaving the third out cold.

Neutral:
1.  I liked that the hotel was away from the strip and was happy to pay the small cab fare to get there. That being said, if you want to be able to go back and forth during the day, it can get pricey. They DO have a shuttle that can be caught at Bally's but we were only able to catch it once, of the three times we tried.
2. Price- Through Priceline, we paid $65\/night and then upon checkin we had to pay an additional $28\/night ""hotel fee."" That fee seems high, but at $100\/night, the price is still reasonable.",1,0,0

First, the bads. The lighting in the rooms is pretty rough. I'm all for energy efficiency, but I hate these d@mn fluorescent bulbs. A lot. Every lamp was equipped with them, and it really made the room feel like a convenience store. Also, the bathrooms had this odd window from the shower to the bedroom. Anytime my suite-mates turned on the bathroom light at night, it shined (shone?) right into the eyes of people trying to sleep. But who sleeps in Vegas?

Next, the Seafood buffet was given a resounding thumbs-down by my parents. I didn't eat it, so I can't speak for myself.

Finally, housekeeping was a little slow, and room service wanted to charge us $3 a champagne flute (sans sparkling wine). I guess I get it, what with it being New Year's Eve and all, but come on. 

The goods. Yes, there were plenty of goods to be had, which is why this got a 4 star review instead of a 3. 

First, the rooms are very spacious, with a sectional sofa and beds and a large bathroom with a sink in and out of the tub area. Very cool. Large closet. Comfy linens. 

Next, the cocktail servers were all very friendly and very prompt. Getting free drinks at the slot machines is a Las Vegas must, and if you develop a friendly relationship with these ladies and gents, they won't disappoint. 

There is a free shuttle that runs from the Rio to either Harrah's or Ballys, so getting to the strip is very easy. The longest I had to wait for a shuttle was 10 minutes. Not a bad way to get around, and very cost efficient.

Finally, the Rio Show in the Sky. Really, really cool. It starts late at night and hits every hour, on the hour. The singers are great, the dancing is good, and then they all go around in these floating Mardi Gras floats and toss beads to the crowd.

Booked two non smoking rooms and was told both rooms we got are non-smoking. Other room stunk of smoke and was assured 32nd floor is non-smoking. When we got to our rooms, I complained to someone at the front desk about the smoke smell and was assured (again) that the 32nd floor is non-smoking and that it is a non-smoking room.  They will have someone come up and clean the air.  We went to dinner so we thought the problem would go away when we came back.  After coming back, the room still stunk so I called front desk again but this time was told that the floor IS A SMOKING FLOOR and the room IS A SMOKING ROOM.

Now stuck trying to get a refund and at 12 am trying to secure other non smoking room.

They do have shuttles to take you back down to Paris\/Bally's & Harrah's, but I can't recommend the walking bit.  We did that the first night and the area doesn't look or feel safe to walk back to at night.  

Cabs are readily available ($10-20 from anywhere to or from on the strip back to the Rio).  The Rio seems 1970's old and outdated (can you say Circus\/Circus or Miami Vice?).   There was a REALLY strange window cut in the middle of the wall in our room that went from the shower into our main room.  So when my husband was in the shower in the morning and the light was on, it came right into the bedroom.  Bizarre!   Totally 1970's Miami Vice or something!  Decor is old and outdated.  The room was clean though.  Housekeeping did an okay job on the days they made it to the room (which was only 3 out of 5).  

Room service was great the one morning I ordered it.  Faster, better, hot and fresh - better than other hotels I've stayed at on the strip so I'll give them the thumbs up on that, but for $30 for breakfast for one I'd expect good food and good service. 

Otherwise, the food and the hotel was 2 star at best.  The casino itself was old, dark and dirty.  Smelled odd, smoky.   

The ""I"" bar in the main lobby was a joke.  The waitresses wore some kind of get ups where their boobs hung out the bottom of their criss-cross tops (lovely) and they wore thong bottoms with a shear skirt deal over this.  Periodically, they'd get up on a lighted pedestal and ""dance.""  Hilarious.  The only thing worse was the watered down drinks, pathetic circa 1970's MTV style videos on the bar TV monitors, terrible ""musak"" in the bar, and all the OLD people there -- oh yeah, and the old fat hookers.  The VooDoo lounge upstairs was even worse.  This is like the hotel where people go who can't go anywhere else.  Just awful.   

The thump, thump, thump from the music every night was a KILLER (very thin walls apparently) especially if you actually needed to get up in the morning.  I didn't sleep all week.   The bed was a back breaker and the pillows were TERRIBLE.   

The room was large, but I'd rather have a smaller room and a better bed, better pillows and LESS NOISE!!! 

Oh and the cherry on the sundae:  NO WIRELESS internet!  And you have to pay extra for internet in this old run-down trip back to the 1970's hotel!  Are you kidding.  So you have to go downstairs, get a cable to have internet and pay extra for it too?!   WTH?!   They must be kidding!!

It was nice then. When I stayed in the early 2000s it seemed degraded, but now the rooms seem nicer and upgraded. We had a suite for 4 guys and plenty of room. Great view of the strip from our suite.  Other hotels have flat panel TV's now. Our still had a big CRT. The couch was nice ... pretty new with a chaise on the end. The shower was interesting - there was a small square window from the shower into the room. Hung out at the pool for a couple of hours on Sunday and it was pretty nice. Large area, with a bar and restaurant. They have a cool-looking bowling alley across from the buffet called Lucky Lanes which i'd like to try out sometime. I like the Seafood Village buffet, but didn't try it this time. It gets crowded but worth the $30 if you like seafood.

After logging into my Total Rewards account online, I saw that the rate for Rio was quite low for Friday and Saturday and Sunday was free!  The rates on Expedia for the same rooms at Rio were noticeably higher and Sunday would not have been free.  So from a room rate perspective for a busy weekend in Vegas, we got a great deal on 3 nights for Rio by booking online through Total Rewards.

During check in, we were offered an upgrade to a recently remodeled room for $20 per night.  The agent recommended this as a very good deal.  The un-remodeled rooms were last remodeled almost 10 years ago vs. 4 months ago for the upgraded rooms.  We took the upgrade and the rooms were pleasantly furnished and carpeted.  The rooms are approximately 600 sq feet but it feels like a lot of wasted space because there's 1 small couch, and a cocktail table in the ""living area"".  There is no separation of a wall or anything between the ""living area"" and the sleeping area.  There was 1 older flat screen TV but it doesn't swivel easily between watching on the bed and watching from the couch.  (It didn't swivel at all actually, you have to turn the entire tv and the non-swivelable tv base toward the couch.)

The pool area is decent. The lounge chairs are older but not terrible.  The nice thing was that there were plenty of them because the Rio pools are not exactly a hip happening place.

The Carnival Buffet is solid and clean and we ate there as part of the 24 Hour Buffet of Buffets for breakfast and lunch.  Without the Buffet of Buffet passes, we wouldn't have eaten here though because the weekend prices were surprisingly quite high.

Unfortunately, of the 4 elevators servicing the Masquerade Tower, only 2 were operational during the entire 3 night stay!   Apparently 1 of the 4 elevators is meant to be a service elevator for the service and cleaning staff.  That was one of the elevators that was broken so we were sometimes sharing already cramped elevators with service staff.  In addition, the UP escalator from the casino floor to access the parking garage was non-operational during our entire stay as well.  There were no visible nearby stairs.  This wouldn't have been so bad but they blocked off access so you could not walk up the escalator on your own either.  This was very annoying!  You then had to backtrack to a nearby elevator that just runs between the 1st and 2nd floor. On Monday morning, there were finally 2 service technicians working to repair the escalator.  It does suck that Rio didn't care enough to fix the elevator and escalator issues as soon as possible to minimize visitor inconvenience.

Overall, we were satisfied with the value because we did get a really good rate when other hotels were 2-3 times the price, so I'm giving it 3 stars.  If not for the double whammy of the aggravating escalator and elevators during our entire stay, I'd have been a happier camper.",2,1,2

The bartenders rudeness was especially difficult to swallow as I was one for 5 years and know how to provide good customer service.

They are the equivalent to the Spirit Airlines of the hotel industry. Lots of add on costs and ridiculously expensive food and drinks. Even for a Vegas resort. They even charge you to use the in-room coffee maker. Hotel 8 doesn't even charge for that. 

If you do not accept the up charge for a newly remodeled room, you will mostly get a run down room where lights, door locks, sink faucets and shower heads do not work properly.

To sum up our stay, there were a few things that went right, but the things that went wrong outnumbered them. 

Right: 
* When there was a long line to check in, there were kiosks that allow guests to check in electronically, w\/o waiting in line. The down side is you can't make any requests for higher floors or Strip views. 
* We stayed in a corner suite in the Ipanema Tower, which gave us a partial view of the Strip, from Caesar's to the Stratosphere and beyond to Downtown, and out of the other window, the view expands to the mountains & Red Rock Natl Park in the distance. 
* Starbucks was located near the elevators of our tower. Not my fav., but certainly convenient.
* The temp control works well and quietly.
* Plenty of seating and fairly spacious 

Wrong: 
* Shower cannot maintain hot water. It turns on hot & within a minute, the water becomes lukewarm to cool. Taking a shower with cool water after coming in from the cold isn't the best experience. 
* I called Front Desk around 10pm to report the problem, and was told the engineer is very busy, so there's no ETA when he will come by. I called back to cancel the request for maintenance because I didn't want to stay up all night waiting. After 12:30am, someone calls and asks if anyone came by. Didn't he think guests might be asleep? We weren't, but that lacks any consideration for guests. 
* Hair dryer did not turn on. We tried pushing the reset button on the outlet, turned the dryer on & off for 5 minutes before it started to work. 
* Next morning, housekeeping decides to open our door without even knocking, even though we had the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door. Then she quickly apologized for a 'mistake' There was A SIGN on ... the ... DOOR! 
* The sink drains clogged. Both of them at the same time. So we had to wait for the water to trickle down before doing anything else, since it could have easily flooded. 
* The furniture in the room should be replaced, at least reupholstered w\/  new cushions. Sofa and chair are both very worn and sink down as soon as I sat in it. 
* Check out time is 11am. At about 10:20, housekeeping decided to let herself in again without knocking, and apologized again. And yes, we had the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on ... AGAIN. Either she has no clue what the sign is for, or these are her first 2 days working there. Regardless ... WTF woman! 
* Getting from the parking garage to front desk is no easy task. Take the bridge on the 4th floor of parking structure, go inside the casino. Take elevator down to 1st floor, walk across the casino floor. It's a lot more annoying than it sounds, because guests are doing this while lugging around heavy luggage.

If everything in the room worked smoothly, and housekeeping didn't keep barging in our room, this review could have easily been a 4 star, but the staff here doesn't seem to have any courtesy or common sense when it comes to their guests. As much as I enjoyed the space and our Strip\/ mountain views ... their mistakes will probably keep me away. 

You should know: 
As I mentioned before, if there's a long line, use the kiosk to check in
If you want to request certain rooms\/view ... wait in line
The Masquerade Tower is the closest to the parking lot for convenience.
Unlike Starbucks at other casinos that don't accept the reward cards, this one does. All of their food items are a rip-off.

It was offered at a discount through the organizers of the event... otherwise our team probably would have been content to stay at any number of cheap hotels.
The bell desk graciously stored our foul smelling gear bags for a few hours before we got to our rooms at no charge. We were able to check in at about 12:30pm with an additional fee of $20 (they will drop it to $10 if you have a player's club card) and checkout at noon without any additional charges. Rooms were accurately advertised, clean and nothing to write home about. One of our guys upgraded to a masquerade suite which made for a nice ""team headquarters"" for post and pre-game partying\/meetings. 
The pool is great. Several different pools with waterfalls and lots of room to relax. They have an adult section full of fat old dudes, with no women anywhere. The good looking women you DO see here are clearly employees and they are jaded, bitter, angry people. 
There are some ok places to eat here but as with most of the larger popular casinos, everything is ridiculously expensive and of questionable value. The do have a Burger King that serves beer. It is directly adjacent to the entrance to the Chippendales show, so at night it was a fantastic place to check out the babes attending.
The cheapest table I saw had a $15 minimum even at 9am on a weekday... a little too spendy for me. Gold Coast next door had tables as low as $3 but it stinks like a dirty ashtray and you'd be lucky to find anyone under the age of 65 in the place.
Not much within walking distance of the Rio. You can easily walk over to Gold Coast or maybe the Palms if you were feeling like a nice stroll. I did walk to In N Out Burger during the day but it was pretty bleak and took about 25 minutes each way. There is a hotel shuttle to the other hotels in the same corporate family available but we opted for taxis and never used it. Do yourself a favor and hit up a grocery store on the way in from the airport and stock up on some snacks so every morsel you eat doesn't have to cost you $18.

We came in for a conference at this hotel and arrived in the morning, with no sleep. I'm not surprised that they first told that check-in is at 4pm, but the front staff offered no help in trying to acquire a room, even after we offered to pay for the previous day, just so we could get a couple hours sleep before the conference started. I hardly believe that a single room at any rate was not available, on a Monday morning. Come back at 12:30 for early check-in was the response. 

We asked if there was any quiet area where we could rest, or somewhere my wife could freshen up to get ready for a meeting. Again, ""no"" was the answer. The concierge told us we might find something on the second floor. We did. A cold stone bench. What kind of hotel doesn't have comfortable seating for relaxing, waiting, small group meetings, discussions, etc.? Well, this one.

After taking no more than 30 minutes of the stone bench, we left. We came back at 12:30 and checked-in to a long line. Early check-in is $20 plus tax extra. Internet, found free in most every hotel in the world, is also extra.

I was under the impression that all rooms were suites. This is not a suite but a single large square room. There is a TV (that you cannot see from the bed) and minibar opposite the window, bed and couch occupying the remaining walls. There is a small alcove with dresser, safe, and a sink to vomit in outside the simple nondescript bathroom which could have come from a Motel 6. The Motel 6 quality continues to the bed, a squeaky overly firm king size with so-so sheets, no bedspread,  a depressed center, and hard foam pillows smelling of cigarette smoke.

I opened the minibar to insert a soda which I had earlier purchased to get cold again. Within 15 minutes a maid appeared with a milk crate and proceeded to empty the entire contents and drag it away. Her stated reason was that their contents was being altered with different brands. She also stated that there was a sensor in the minibar that alerted staff that it was being used and we would be automatically charged for it's use.  WTF? 

I do not wish to be unfair to Motel 6, but there, you don't expect a JW Marriott, here you do. What you get here is a Motel 6 with a casino under it. It's redeeming quality is that the Gold Coast is next door and you and go there for the inexpensive breakfast.",3,2,0

A (2) day stay =  $29 * 2 days = $58 plus $15 Transaction Fee = $73 in BOGUS fees for 2 night stay.

Any hotel that charges a resort fee starts at one star for me.  They could earn back a point or two if I were blown away with service, but their starting point is 1 star due to the bogus resort fees.

Go across the street!  Gold Coast Resort fee = $17.91 per night, NO transaction fee.  AND they are renovated - nice rooms .. Rio added new headboards and call it a renovated room. It's Disgusting - OLD room from the 70's.

Largest bar on the casino floor is closed Sun-Thurs. A lot of retail space empty and boarded up. You could shoot a canon through the place and not hit a sole, BUT they're holding strong to their $29 Bogus Resort Fee. 

Bartenders are rude and talk about their union a lot. I found the bartenders at Gold Coast MUCH more friendly. Rio charges your bank account a $50 deposit for in-house charges, BUT try. Just try to open a bar tab and charge it to your room. The union bartenders tell you that you don't have charging privileges.

Pros
Spacious rooms

Cons
Poor customer service
Tacky decor
Nickel and dime charges
Unprofessional dealers

The room was big and clean. That's all that I expect, that's what I got. Every other part of my experience was a disappointment. Some stories from my 3-day stay:

Where's my toothpaste?
My toothpaste was confiscated at the airport, so I called housekeeping for some toothpaste. I waited for one hour, then I went to sleep (this was at 12am). I woke up at 4am (jetlag) and went downstairs to gamble. Along the way, I ask the front desk to get me some toothpaste. They call it a ""dental kit"", as they don't give individual tubes of toothpaste. After a couple of hours I head back to my room and lo and behold, there's a bag hanging on my doorknob! It's...new bedsheets, no toothpaste. I call housekeeping again and 20 minutes later, I finally get my toothpaste. Third time's the charm, right?

Haha, you lost your money
I was playing blackjack with a couple of other strangers and we were all losing. One guy decides to bet big and puts down $400. Great, he gets a 20! But oh no, the dealer gets 21. :( Okay, no big deal, it's not the dealer's fault. But then she says, ""Haha"" and takes his chips. Wow. Really? Seriously? We are already losing hundreds of dollars, we're feeling kinda crappy, and to be funny you say ""haha""? Wow. Thanks for that. Listen, we know we're playing a losing game. We know the house could easily get blackjack. But, when you are on the winning end and we are on the losing end of the odds, you don't mock the player and rub it in their face. Shortly after that I left the table and didn't play another round of blackjack at the Rio.

How dare you ask the Concierge desk for help!
As I was happily leaving the Rio, I asked them what time the shuttle service to the Strip started. The gentleman at the front desk took one look at my bags and said, ""Oh, they won't let you on with their luggage."" Seriously? Okay, I asked, what are my options. He literally shrugged, told me to walk or get a taxi and went back to his work on his computer. Not a single follow up comment. This was at 9:30am and there was no one else in line for help.

Others
There's a Chippendale's Dancing Theater, which adds to the less-then-classy atmosphere, and very disparate décor. You have the luxurious Whopper Bar to treat you to your Burger King obsession. They also charge $13 per day per device for internet. Really? Is this the 1990's, where wi-fi is a fancy technology? 

I may never go back to Vegas. But if I do, it will not be at the Rio.",6,0,0

       My room was so dirty, I've stayed at Motel 6's that were cleaner.  The carpet was coming up, the wallpaper was peeling off.  I saw candy left on the floor near the bed.  In the bathroom someone had wipped bloody boogers on the wall.  The mini bar had dust so thick on it, it  look like it had never been touched.

A notice about their recent Legionnaire's disease slipped under our door the night before we check out. Are they serious?

The lines are long and they move like snails. They charged me $20 to be put on the wait list for early check-in. They called me when my room was ready and I had to line up again for my keys.

The room and furniture was outdated. The bathroom sink drain made a loud noise every time you turned the water off. The shower was HORRIBLE. The shower head only halfway worked at best and the rest of the water was still coming out of the faucet below. Screws were coming off of the shower doors. And the toilet would not flush! You have to go back after the tank fills up to flush again and pray everything goes down! The carpet between the bathroom and the outside was unraveling. My toes got caught and I nearly tripped. A knob was missing to one of the table lamp so no light for reading.

The toiletries provided were a bar of soap, hand lotion and shampoo. No body wash, no hair conditioner. Some of their white towels are gray. The tissues were like sandpaper on your face.

The headboard\/curtain was falling off the wall. The blankets were thin and the sheets were rough.

The convention center is nice but if you need your mid afternoon coffee? Forget it, Starbucks and Hash House A Go Go closes early. Walked across to another Starbucks with no seating but, for your pleasure feel free to return to the closed Starbucks and sit at their closed, lights off dark lounge.

The first night I crashed in a friend's room that had an extra bed and the second night was only $60 including the resort fee.  The first night was a typical comp room from the old days.  Dirty looking old room and you could see dirty grout in the shower.  I was in the room to sleep for 5 hours so I was fine--didn't shower there.  The toilet paper holder was broken.  Ghetto!  That was room 1512 in Ipanema Tower.  The second night my room was better but still a typical standard room but for whatever reason the dead bolt would stick out so it would slam loudly every time I tried to close the door and then it didn't actually close the door.  That was room 1042 in Ipanema Tower.  That's a huge liability and safety issue.  Please always make sure your doors are closed and locked whether in the room or leaving the room!  I read a review here that said a stranger went into their room and was able to get security to open the safe in the room--I'm wondering if this is what happened?  

Anyhow, it is offstrip.  No one is really here so it's dead (but I kinda like that).  One elevator in each side of the tower was not working and the elevators are slow.  Everything is outdated and old (compared to the new hotels).  I did take the free shuttle but it's honestly easier to take a cab--$15-$20 each way to\/from the strip.

I tried the spa--it was okay.  The robe was a bit rough for me so I didn't use it.  The slippers and shower amenities were okay.  I got a free scrub to use in the shower that smelled like baby powder.  They had pretzels and water and juice.  The only thing I was grossed out about is I saw two girls that had arrived before me (I assume cuz they were changing out of their regular clothes) and they went straight into the jacuzzi tub without showering.  People--you are supposed to shower before entering the common shared areas like a jacuzzi.  The steam room was perfect but a little dirty.  Someone had left their used towel and bucket in there.  Plus you could see hairs and dirt.  Also, the lockers are the old manual key lock so you have to carry it with you everywhere.

I went to eat at the pho place.  Don't.  Staff was friendly but the soup was too salty and ingredients weren't the best.  The summer roll wasn't that good either though I liked the sauce.

I gambled a little here.  Staff were okay but I had one very intoxicated lady playing next to me and they gave her another drink and let her keep playing.  It was so weird cuz in the past, they would stop serving drinks and if bothersome, ask that person to leave.  She was getting flushes though--good for her!

I've seen Penn & Teller before and was looking forward to seeing them but they're currently on Broadway:(

She couldn't get it through her thick skull that there were other exhibits and that the people who paid A LOT of money to attend the con didn't need to get in line and definitely didn't need to be treated like crap by this TSA reject.  
3.  All the food choices are way over priced.  Smashburger was the most reasonable.
4.  I heard many con attendees complaining about water getting into their rooms during a rain shower we had.  Hey Rio, there's a new invention out there called caulk.  Try it sometime.

All in all if I didn't live here in Vegas and wanted to attend the con I'd stay in the Gold Coast.",0,0,0

Once we got into our room we were pretty surprised at how nice the room ended up being. Big king size bed with separate toilet\/shower and double sinks with a mini refrigerator. The closet has a two way opening on both sides one side leading to the door the other opening to the bathroom area. The room is very spacious with a couch as well. Big window glasses with a view towards the mountain and old strip. All this for $145 this is a two night three day stay. So I'm not complaining. 

The hotel has a free shuttle that takes you to the strip as well. Which was helpful if we didnt want to drive, because we wanted to drink. It all worked out because our friend got married in Paris and there was one shuttle that took us to ballys which is connected with Paris. They have other shuttles to take you to different hotels. 

On days that we wanted to drive, it would only take about 5 mins.

Canceling my Total Rewards card and will be staying at a non Caesars entertainment hotel and casino going forward. I visit Vegas 2 to 3 times a year and usually stay at the Rio and this was the worst hotel experience I've ever had. Upon entering my room I was greeted with a large wet stain on the couch. I shrugged it off and went down to the casino. While walking down the hallway on the 15th floor in the Ipanema tower I noticed that EVERY SINGLE light fixture was either missing or damaged as if someone put their hand through it. There also a large piece of molding laying on the ground that used to be on the wall. I called up the front desk and I had to deal with 3 people passing the buck for 15 minutes until all I got was excuses with a dismissive attitude. Left to hit the strip the following day and upon coming back to the room I was greeted with a pair of latex gloves sitting on the bed.  Pretty nasty. While gambling at the roulette table I asked for 2 bottles of water and as the cocktail server brought back my order I asked her if she could break a 20 so I could tip her and she said she couldn't and got all pissy and walked away. Later that night I was at the wheel of fortune slots smoking and here comes the same rude waitress walking by and throws an ashtray on the counter next to me and says I might want to use an ashtray. lol.

The hotel was average at best and a bit deceptive based on circumstantial evidence.  I really needed to stay here as it was the host hotel  - when making reservations they repeatedly denied knowing about the seminar negotiated room rate (I called several times and spoke with multiple people in reservations.). I was stuck at the higher room rates.  I have never run into this with any other hotel and have attended numerous seminars over the years.

When I checked in they made absolutely no mention of the wifi, pool access, and gym access I found out later that I had a mandatory ""resort fee"" for.  I made the bad assumption you only paid if you used those amenities.  They made no mention of this until checkout.  Even when I checked out they denied knowing anything about the seminar that had gone in all week in the hotel.

It is not on the strip so sundries like drinking water, band aids, coffee, etc. are at a premium.  The cheapest pint of water I could find was $3 in the floor machine.  There is a Keurig in the room with 3 single K-cups for a $9 charge.  I have stayed all over the world and have never seen this setup.  I have stayed in rooms with no coffeemaker but never has there been a coffeemaker minus the complimentary coffee.  The best I could do was nearly $18 at the downstairs Starbucks for 12 K-cups.  I am one of those people who needs coffee immediately when my eyes open.

The Carnival buffet and our lunches during the week were very unimpressive.  On the bright side, the Hash House and Indian buffet were very good.  If I was staying somewhere else I would take a taxi to go eat at the Indian restaurant there.

When hotel guests book at a resort hotel they expect to be able to use all amenities. This is why we choose a resort hotel right? 

Well I believe they have four or five pools. For the three days of our stay all pools were closed for resurfacing!  When I called to ask about it they said it isn't included in the 'resort fee' and said no more. 

I was so upset I hung up on the guy who cut me off when I was speaking to him. In my opinion if you are going somewhere and something as significant as all water amenities are closed guests should be either discounted their hotel rate or allowed to cancel without penalty. 

This trip sucked thanks to RIOs lack of regard for their guests!  Not everyone wants to drink and gamble all vacation!

Shame on you RIO!",2,0,0

After checking in, my family and I take the elevator to the 20th floor and stepped out into a loud buzzing environment with lights flickering outside of the elevator which did not sound good at all and looked more of a hazard. I looked up to see that the corner of the ceiling had a burned mark and that the light bulbs could potentially start a fire. This made me wonder how long it's been this way and if the hotel even cared for the safety of its customers. At this point, we felt like we were in a scene of a horror film. The room appeared clean, but the entire fixings of the bathtub can use some repairing and cleaning since there was mildew and mold in every crevice. Disgusting!!!! Anyways, fast forward to the day of checking out... I left my hotel room with my family for about an hour to get breakfast and come back to my room to find a coffee pot placed next to the sink. I had the ""DO NOT DISTURB"" sign hung outside of the door knob, but house keeping (or ""whoever"" which disturbs me just thinking about it) obviously ignored it and decided to enter. Helloooo?!?!? Are you serious?!?!? No one in the room ordered coffee or any appliances! On another note, we always check to ensure our room is completely closed each time we leave. We checked to see if any of our personal belongings were stolen, but luckily, nothing seemed to have been tampered with or taken. This was quite bothersome! Knowing that someone entered our room made us feel unsafe and uncomfortable especially with the ""DO NOT DISTURB"" sign. What's the point of it then???? I filed a report with security and a complaint with the supervisor who says they'll look into it and check who entered the room during the time we were away. I just want to make sure that this hotel takes our situation seriously to ensure the safety of others who stay here and will respect their privacy because even if this were a mistake (ie. house keeping wasn't paying attention with the room number and do not disturb sign), THIS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN AT ALL!",2,0,0

And there was some kind of sky show at certain hours.  It hasn't changed much from outside and inside, checking was painfully long on this day because of Deathcon, now I regret staying at the event hosting hotel.  I'm just glad we didn't have to split up to wait for the badges as well since a friend took care of that the day before. And you would think the hotel would put more ppl at the checkin desk for the surge of the guests, and be well prepared of such surge from many years of hosting the same event which attracts the ppl from over the world.  Apparently, our reservation was not to be even though I had confirmed the day before, but we were offered an upgrade $150 to stay at one of their premium suite on the 20th floor of Ipanema Tower, on top of the base rate which came to $340 per night plus the resort fee.  That seems to be a decent rate to me, because I remember paying almost that much in Stratosphere for one tiny room years ago.  We did not have another reservation somewhere else, so why not?  

The problem with this suite is that one of my kids has to sleep on the couch, as they only allow one roll away bed per suite.  

The suite was fine, very clean, contemporary but not showy which I like.  I LOVE the big tub by the window, and its switch operated shade.  Nice touch with  the panelings above the shade in the sitting room, they brighten up the room a bit and gave the otherwise dull looking drapery a classic look.  The furnitures were plain and worn out somewhat, the decoration was minimum which suits me.  My other favorite part of the room is the vanity and the stool that comes with it, albeit the stool could use some cleaning.  The walking closet has a safe which didn't work, because the battery has worn out.  I called the front desk, the repair man came and fixed it.  

Took me a while to rinse my long hair in the shower, because water leaked at the faucet, so only two third of that already economical flow came to the shower head.  While drying my hair, I was distracted by their shower window which I haven't seen it elsewhere.  Don't think they designed it with mitigating the slow shower flow in mind, rather it was a fashion statement or a way to let lighting in from the bedroom, any way, it's quite unique and I like it.  

Warning: don't use their shaving kit, because the blade can actually hurt you.  Also, I'm glad I brought my own Q-tip, because their Q-tip can't hold candle to the store bought ones.  

Keurig coffee single cup brewer and the two TVs worked fine and the AC worked great also.  The bed was firm and comfortable, no complains there.  I did not smell much smoke except the third night and I hardly heard any noise.  Had trouble using wifi, very slow or not working at all.

We use to stay at the Black Hat hosting hotel for the last few years, this time we decided to stay at Rio.  Little did we know that dinning could be a challenge.  The buffets have long lines before they were open, the American Bar and Grill was bursting out of its capacity, so I opted to dine out, thankfully there is Gold Coast.  Lots of other deathcon attendees went over there as well, judging by their distinctive attire with flashing or non flashing (minus the battery) badges. 

Didn't get to try KJ's dim sum, but we tried their dinner which I have to say, not impressed.  To sum up the experience, big price for small portioned mediocre overly salted food with halt service. 

There are 10 lifts for the tower, the average wait for the lift could be from 1-6 mins,  I heard someone saying there isn't enough lift for this tower.  I bet it's not like this everyday.  Also, one needs to insert the room key in the lift for the 20th floor, it's just one extra thing to do.

The bill was large, our splurge for the year, or whatever makes the man happy.  We are working poor but we can make the boat float by regulating the flow economically for the rest of the year as well.",11,8,10

I booked this room through travelocity, it was for my husband's 30the birthday. From the pictures, we were excited. Strop view, nice tub for him to soak in, four pools. I knew it was too good to be true. Check out was pretty fast, expreds check in through the kiosk. Kept offering room upgrades, never happened but should've taken it. When we got to the room, I immediately stated, ""this is not worth $150 for the night."" The room looked nothing like the pictures, it was obviously dated which is not included in the pictures, the curtains are two bits away from falling apart (the track was off), the toilet ran from morning til next morning (it's been running all night and here it is 0853, I can still hear it), the shower doors did not close and when you tried to close it, the screeching sound that came from the bathroom was UNBAREABLE (it was soul wrenching). After I sort of got over the initial infuriating shock, we decided to go to the pool. We stopped at the gift shop for smokes and sun screen. First, cigarettes are $14 FOR SHORTS and second, a small can of spray on sunscreen was $30. Pero like, porque?! We get out to the pool, one pool is shut down and drained, we go to the big pool with the hot tubs and all the cool waterfalls, I couldn't go into that area because I didn't bring my photo ID to show the bouncer. I DID NOT BRING MY PHOTO ID TO SHOW THE BOUNCER TO PROVE I WAS 21 TO GO INTO THE POOL AREA. Let's let that soak in for a minute. Besides the fact I've had issues in the past with vacations and stolen wallets and IDs, no where on any sign or any document or even on line was it stated you needed to bring ID with you, even if you aren't drinking because it's a million freaking degrees outside and I'm sorry I don't really wanna live through my own ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", you cannot go to that pool, all the way in the back. So that left me with two choices, the kids pool or the kids pool. Needless to say, I'm pretty angry. Nah. I'm hella furious at this point. After all of this, we ordered room service because everything else was crazy busy, there was an $8 service fee just to bring the food up to the room, we asked the guy if we could just charge our card, heooked at me like I was speaking another language then said "" uh. I guess. I need to use your phone though."" Like, what?! Then, probably twenty minutes later, the person for room service, called back and said they couldn't process any payments because of the high amount of service calls they were getting at that time.

I have been heading to vegas now for well over a decade and have stayed at many properties, I will never set foot in the Rio again, I am a poker player and have considered the world series of poker, but now I think not!

I realize that Las Vegas is the desert, but seriously lets throw some humidity in the air please, dry smokey stale nasty!  My room was dated, which is fine, but the air was even unbreathable in my room!  I literally would start to gag when I walked through the gaming floor!  Here I sit back in Chicago with a stuffed nose a sore throat and an overall disdain about me!

Rio could offer me 2 weeks free stay in their best room and I would say NO!

The sad part is, the staff was relatively nice and accommodating; all things considered...

The poker room dealers and floor managers were great, clearly the company shifts their dealers from property to property, I recognize most of the dealers from Caesar's Palace.  Even the action in the poker room was fun and exciting, but all that goes out the window when you can't breathe... (guessing they rotate because no one wants to be stuck in that nasty air every day)

My coworkers experienced the exact same thing so I know it was not just me, One of my coworkers woke up with bleeding noses and feeling hung over when he was not even drinking or smoking...

Having stayed at dozens of properties in Las Vegas this is not the norm, far from it in fact!  At the top of my List is the Renaissance Las Vegas (non-gaming property), but also have enjoyed Caesars, Bellagio, The Hotel @ Mandalay Bay, here is the kicker even the Imperial Palace which last I stayed (2 years ago) was super out dated, still manages a cleaner more humidified breathing environment!

I was so devastated by the air quality I couldn't even complain because I knew whatever they would offer me would be in that hotel and every minute I spent in that environment would have just made me that much sicker!

the rooms here are large.  it's true they aren't exactly suites and are pretty much just really big basic rooms, but let me tell you from someone who is hotels much of the year, i would choose a large basic room over a small basic room any day.

It's true they the beds arent that comfortable, and they charge me $14 a day for internet which i think is ridiculous but it's a casino...they want to keep you on the floor.  I figure i can't complain too much as there is 100 hotels out here and i chose to stay here.  

I have never had a problem with cleanliness here.  If you want to get something a bit more like a sweet as for something on the 20th floor as the rooms here are much fancier (though the basic room is still just a big square).

They do have lots of actual ""suites"" here....but you arent going to get them for $30 online.

the ipanema tower is where we prefer to stay.  They have two towers here, and this one is much nice, and in the middle of the hotel.

Everywhere i have eaten here is amazing.  Buzios is top notch sea food, Martoano's is a fun Italian place with great food, loud music (not so great for chit chat..but it is lots of fun).  the all american grille serves awesome steaks (chicken fried steak is amazing) and they are open all night.   There is a couple fast food places if you look really hard (down at the end by the masqurade tower upstairs, though expect the prices to be jacked high too). 

i don't gamble much, but the table rates fluctuate greatly depending on the weekend you are here.  If the casino is packed, then the rates are high.  If you want low table rates you have to come at a time when the casino is slow.

Either way there are much better places to stay in vegas, but there are also much worse places.  I have always thought even with internet rates, hotel fees and such that if you aren't getting your room comped and have to pay for it...a total charge of $60 a night is cheap anywhere you go.",6,4,4

The hotel itself is alright, parked at the masquerade, big mistake, my bf did not enjoy being greeted by naked guys and it's about a mile walk to the lobby. So second time round, parked in the Carnival parking lot. a much closer walk.

Check in took like an hour. omg. but with the free upgrade, no complaints here!
The casino in itself doesn't look grand or friendly. The carnival buffet is only a one-time experience (I wrote a review for that last year) The voo doo lounge does give one of the best views in Vegas. but the crowd was not appealing to me. 

Tip: Park in carnival NOT masquerade if you're staying in the hotel. or eating at the carnival. Exit flamingo rd. on the 10e

There weren't long check in lines, but we opted for Kiosk check in, which took less than two minutes to scan drivers license and it provided us with two room keys.   A few employees were in the lobby to direct guests to towers and answer any questions.   We found our room with no trouble and it was BEAUTIFUL!  LIving area, dining area, wet bar, bath and a half (the main bathroom had a massive shower with a rain tower.  A separate bedroom with a jacuzzi.  Free WIFI.   Three TVs - living\/bed\/bath.   Everything was spotless!  Each day our room was cleaned before we returned to change for dinner and each time it was as clean as it was when we first arrived.  We had a great time in the casino, while we also went to Harrahs, Paris & Flamingo and spent hours at each - The Rio was the only one where we were offered drinks while gambling - the other casinos were offering I'm sure, but their staff must have been on long breaks.   We ate at smash burger - tasty stuff.   The All American Grill was great for bacon & eggs at 11pm as well as a huge steak & cheese sub.  The Chinese restaurant was good, but pricy - however, we were invited to 'ask questions' which I thought was mainly about some of the traditional dishes (you won't find Chow Mein\/Lo Mein\/Egg Foo Young -Chinese fast food here) Though we ordered Sweet & Sour Pork (highly recommend) it's not like what you can get down the street.   It was delicious, as was the Young Chow Fried Rice.    Everything is ala carte. We also ordered the Cashew Chicken, which was good, though bland.   If you go, just one order will feed at least three hungry people.   The pork and rice we each had 2 hearty serving of and almost half the bowl was left of each.   They encourage sharing as you each have a plate and bowls of entree and rice are separate with large serving spoons.  So, we didn't need the Cashew Chicken entree and spent $20-something more than we needed to - but really not disappointed, just never thought to ask how large the portions were. It was after 9 pm when we arrived, so there were no tables near us to see what the servings looked like, though several tables became occupied before we finished.  
The Starbucks lines were insane and I prefer DD anyway, so while our room had a coffee pot, we opted to hit the casino floor to gamble and got coffee from servers - all who made it back to where we were before our cups were empty.

I will say some good things still exists here. Buffet still rocks (Minor issue, see below)  All American Bar and Grill is still good for Sunday Football. Room was very clean and housekeeping took care of everything to a T. The personnel that worked the front desk, valet, and our waitress were great and I am glad that the Rio has kept up the tradition of good friendly hotel staff. 

It used to be such a nice change of pace staying away from the strip away from the hustle and bustle and you never even had to go to the strip because there was always so much to do here. Look I was a fan and stayed here many many times over the years. The pools were always so much fun, and now later in the year (November and it was 78*) even though the weather is still co operative, pools are closed and one is drained and empty. Shops are now empty, and what shops are open are having 50% off sales and pushy sales people hocking their crap. Escalator has been ""roped off"" for four days now. No soft serve at the buffet!  WTF!!!  Trash cans have been filled to capacity like they cut back on janitorial staff. The rooms have been advertised as recently renovated. And by that, I mean leave the chipped tile on the bathroom floor but throw a coat of paint on other things.  Free wi fi for only one device per day that you still pay a resort fee for so ultimately it isn't really free. And it's spotty service at best. 

And no more show in the sky ?  Really ?  Has the economy been so bad that they eliminated something that originally put them on the map ?  Sad.

*Casino Floor: The gaming area is huge, and has more than enough tables for everyone there.  Had a great time playing craps, roulette, poker, Mississippi stud and 3-Card Poker.  Didn't have a chance to check out the poker room though.  

*Rooms: While I will say that they are very big and roomy, they can definitely use an upgrade.  There were various stains on the carpet, and it could use a good thorough cleaning.  The beds were OK, as I have slept on much nicer and comfortable beds.  Hard Rock Hotel has them beat.  But who stays in the rooms all day anyways?? And when most of my stay is comped, I really can't complain.  We had connecting rooms which is always great when we need to steal towels, toiletries, cologne, borrow the restroom or just bug our friends next door.

*Food: They have lots of restaurants, but only the All-American Grill is open late into the wee hours.  Visited the deli at the sports book, both Starbucks, the Carnival World Buffet and the All American Grill.  A small cafe with quick eats would be great here.

*Pool Area: Their pool is OK, as it does have three (3) different pools that you can choose from. There are lots of reviews for Voodoo beach, check those out if you want to read more on that.

We went to the buffet there and the food was good.  We also went to Michael Jackson Experience Concert and it was so fun.  So overall from Gina, to the food, Michael Jackson and our huge perfect view room we had a amazing time and whenever I visit Vegas again the Rio will be my choice of hotel.",0,0,0

But I can't help but love this hotel and casino.

For the deals I have gotten, I will take the outdated rooms and lack of nightlife. Because, to compensate, those outdated rooms are HUGE! And you have a starbucks right as you exit the elevators. They also have the best video poker machines, and it is located right across from the Palms - A super quick and inexpensive cab ride to go party.

I've also heard their basement winery and pool are amazing, and cannot wait to try that out in the Summer.",2,1,1

It was dirty, musty, mildewed, the pool was closed a lot during normal hours of operation, the food was okay. The game floor was run-down, dirty, stinky (like someone crapped their pants-all the time). The elevators were often crowded and we had to wait in a mob to get on an elevator. There were always long lines at reception and concierge. We were there on weekdays. The shuttle services was poor - always waiting for the second or third shuttle to pick us up from the strip to come back. A cab would've been easier and worth the money.

We had a great view of the pool and the strip which made things even better. 

The hotel as a whole is great, the only reason why I feel it is 4 stars and not 5  is because the food selection is very slim. There is only 1 real ""fast food"" place (BK Bar- which is terrible!) and the Sports Deli is next in line for a quick bite (I only had a pizza slice there- it was okay). Everything else there is a sit down meal or the buffet. I think this hotel would do well with some sort of food court. The best food we had during our stay would definitely have to be Carnival World buffet. 

We will definitely be staying here during our next trip. I love that this hotel is close to the strip but far enough away to where you are away from all the craziness. Shuttle service is great as well- 10am-1am every 30 mins drop off\/pick up at Harrah's or Bally's.",5,0,0

The room was spacious... and I mean really big. The sinks didn't drain so I called the front desk. No answer just music. I called again... no answer.... just music.

We did notice that checkin at midnight to 2am has VERY long lines.

We also were celebrating our wedding anniversary, so we chose to dine at the VooDoo restaurant on the 50th floor. Yea...$200 for dinner and no drinks....but the food was AWESOME, the atmosphere was elegant, the service was phenomenal, and the experience romantic (yea....I got a few husband points to be sure). Even I found it quite enjoyable and well worth the visit...will do so again the next time in Vegas.

After dinner we went to the Voodoo Lounge on the 51st floor. The average age for women was about early to mid-thirties (very nicely dressed - okay - say it- HOT).  Most guys were mid 30's to mid 40's....but decidedly more women than men. The music was high energy and lot of people dancing.

We have stayed at easily 20 to 25 hotels on or immediately near the strip. We LOVED the high energy of this hotel. Lots and lots of the beautiful people were here....and we certainly enjoyed the eye candy.

How many times have I stayed at the Rio?  Too many times...I stopped counting.  At least the Ipanema Tower is better from years ago.  They still need to renovate that Masquerade Tower though.  The pet friendly tower just isn't cool.  C'mon, I know you might miss your pugsy wugsy, poodsy woodsy, or something but please, it's Vegas, leave your pets at home or a Pet Hotel.  I don't need the scent of dog in the room you just checked out of and I just checked into.  That is if I am unfortunate enough to get stuck in the Masquerade Tower.

Mini fridges are located in the rooms which makes it quite convenient to load a private stock of beer and drinks, that are far cheaper, from the grocery store than from the minibar.

The pools here aren't bad either.  They get nice and sunny.  A lot of kiddies sometimes but OK for the most part.  As far as eating establishments, I would recommend only Mah Jong and Sports Deli.  VooDoo Lounge for the view.  I think the others are just OK... You can find better value and better taste from similar restaurants around Vegas.

I'll start with the good stuff, the stuff that was provided , yet that would be expected in a hotel that charged half the price.

(1)  Online check in, so we just had to pick up our keys. This was convenient.

(2)  The ""suite"" was decent size, but I'm not sure what made it a ""suite."" The couch?

And...that's about it. Now for the stuff that disappointed:

(1)  When we checked in, wearing my tux and my wife in her wedding dress, there was nothing more than a ""congratulations.""  Not that we were really expecting freebies, but we kind of expected SOMETHING - champagne, some drink comps even... Nothing.

(2)  The girl at the front desk put us in what she said was a ""quiet"" room. Nothing could have been farther from the truth. Although I understand she can't control our obnoxiously loud neighbors, she stuck us on a corner overlooking the pool. The pool has a DJ or something at 8am, so forget sleeping in at all after a long night of Vegas celebration.

(3)  The shower was abhorrent. Lake Mead is at record low water levels, California is in its worst drought in recent history. Our bathtub leaked...constantly...the entire time. I'm not talking a slow drip. It was a constant and steady stream of water.  

Maybe the leaking affected water pressure because the shower was all kinds of jacked up.  Don't stay at the Rio if you enjoy warm showers. Turning the temperature as hot as it would go, for 5-10 minutes, was not enough to avoid an uncomfortably cold shower. One word can describe the bathing experience at the Rio: miserable.

(4)  In case you sleep through the bumping music at the crack of dawn, they ensure you are awakened by the sun. Although there are blackout shades, they're not in very good shape, so it was impossible to close them completely. As a result, at about 6:30am, a bright beam of light shown right on to our faces. Aahhh, what a pleasant wake up (sarcasm).

(5)  There's supposedly WiFi, but the log-in information is never provided, so just expect to use a lot of your phone's data plan while you're here.

(6). There was supposed to be checkout via the TV, but that didn't work. We got an error message that said to try back in 5 mins. Well, we didn't have time for that, so we tried to call the front desk and got put on hold for 10 mins. Never talked to a live person, so tried to leave a message... We just hope that it worked.

The only reason we'll ever come back here is the Voodoo Steakhouse, which was amazing. That, or if we leave something behind, God forbid.",7,3,1

So the city and every hotel was either booked or super expensive.

We checked in and everyone at the counter was friendly. We didn't have to pay the early check in fee which was nice. We got the room and it was nice to see how big the rooms are and you get a fridge as well. Now the room itself could definitely use a little upgrade. My towell rack in the bathroom was hanging on by a screw. The room just felt a little dated, I was not going to be surprised if there was a tube TV. The casino is exactly what you need if you are going to stay at the hotel and gamble. 

If you do stay here and want to catch the shuttle they will take you to Harrahs, Paris and Ceasars for free. You may have to wait 15 minutes or so but still it was nice to be able to get to the strip at no charge. I didn't get a chance to check out the pool but from what I saw there are 3 of them. I was too busy running around for the wedding. 

Food options here are a plenty. If you have not tried the buffet once then you are missing out. It's pretty epic....I mean yeah its a buffet but it's a buffet on steroids. I pretty much lived of the Sports Deli while I was here, you can find my review if you look it up.

 First of all, the room is big! I loved it! It wasn't fancy mind you, think Mandalay Bay minus the giant tub. It did have an L shaped couch, so you can squeeze a lot of people in there if you wanted to. There was a small fridge and pantry space too. We would have appreciated a microwave...
We woke up close to noon on Saturday, which made us feel like the pool would be out of the question (this is July). We decided to give it a shot anyway and headed for the pool. We saw that all the chairs were taken, children in diapers running around us and screaming teenagers galore. NOT OUR CUP OF TEA. We were about to write off the whole experience and go get hammered, when an angel appeared! Okay, not so much an angel as an employee baring wristbands for the 21 + pool. We got those wristbands and walked right past the madness and into a serene aqua paradise. There were plenty of chairs, waitresses baring drinks and a few ladies baring their goodies...lol. We ordered drinks and sat on the pool bench and relaxed the afternoon away. 
Later that night we gave Crown a try instead of Voodoo for a change. I did like Crown a little better, the layout is nice and the music is much better. We did have to take a drive to the strip to see our show, but it wasn't a hassle at all. I would definitely recommend Rio.",4,5,4

I've lived in Las Vegas going on 7 years now, so I think I can officially say I'm a local. I'm well aware of the reputation that most of the casino properties around town possess. The Rio doesn't have the worst reputation, but it certainly is not as highly held as it was around the turn of the century.

That being said, when my mother paid a recent visit to Las Vegas, she mentioned that she liked the Rio, so I set her up for a night there as a part of her visit. I got a great deal on a third party website and hoped for the best.

Things actually started off on a bit of a sour note. When I called to ask about an early check in around 2pm I was told that there were no early check ins unless a 15.00 fee was paid. No thank you, we will wait the extra 2 hours.When we arrive the main entrance off of Flamingo Road is blocked by a Metro Police officer. Nice. When we finally found our way into the property, only valet seemed to be available, with a massive line to boot. I am thinking this was a huge mistake.

But they really turned things around quick! The valet had us checked in less than 3 minutes later, we unload her luggage and head inside. The line for check in is healthy but not too bad and the front desk agents are really moving thru them rather quickly. We waited for maybe 10 minutes, which wasn't too bad at all. We are called to the desk to check in by Walter. Walter is incredibly friendly and very helpful. I explained the situation that I was a local and had gotten the room for my mother fon her 62nd birthday and all I asked was to request a high floor for her, since she loves a good view(who doesn't, huh? :P) Walter upgraded her from the standard king room to a massive 1600 square foot suite on the 31rst floor! All for no upgrade charge! Wow! Thank You Walter! I can't thank him enough as this was easily one of the highlights of her trip! She is STILL talking about the suite she got to enjoy for the night! The room was very clean with cieling to floor windows with a gorgeous view of the strip! 

We saw the Show in the Sky (which was a lot of fun) and had fun gambling and eating on the property. I stayed in the Rio myself in 2006 and always thought highly of it, so I don't understand some of the things I hear about it. I have always had fun at the Rio. Plus that buffet is pretty good to boot!

Thanks again to Walter for helping to make a special memory for my mother on her 62nd birthday! It means more to her than you realize.

So this is simply a review on the casino floor.  And what a sad, sad place this is.  I think the name of the hotel actually gives the country of Brazil a bad rap.

The casino room floor appears old and the carpet in desperate need of some cleaning.  The ""uniforms"" of the waitresses serving you drinks were borderline stripper outfits.  I mean, I know it's Vegas and the definition of class is a bit fuzzy, but they could have done better.  The organization of the hotel itself was a complete joke, and don't believe anything the signs tell you....ask someone.  We spent a good 15 minutes trying to find the seafood buffet (which is supposed to be good), and all we needed to do was walk from one end of the hotel to the other.  The signs had us going around in circles.

Based on this experience alone, I wouldn't be paid, let alone pay myself, to stay here.  I just felt all yucky walking around.

The one thing I will give them, is that the valet cost is based on tip alone.  So it's up to you what you want to spend.  But they do take a while to bring your car too you.",0,0,1

I said are you kidding me!! Really! You want us to leave for a mistake you made, which made us feel very uncomfortable! He said if you arent happy I will be more than happy to check you out but I cannot give you all your money back sorry! I was so disappointed. We were not going to leave it was the holiday. We drove 6 hours to get here! We just wanted an honest apologize and get this all straightened out. I went to security after this and asked to file a formal complaint he asked why! I explained the scenario again.

I went back 1 more time for more crab legs and salad (I felt guilty that I hadn't eaten any veggies\/fruits the entire day).  The desserts were so-so but I definitely liked the banana fosters combined with the cheesecake, recommendations from Cola C.

However there is a shuttle that runs to and from the strip-we didn't use it though.  The casino has a wide variety of games, poker room is rather small for WSOP hotel, but does the job.  Drink service is slow-after 11pm on the casino floor-can't speak to any other time, because I tend to only gamble after 11pm.  They have a wide variety of shops, sundry store is open 24 hours, the one located by the Ipanema towers (which are closer to the front).  No arcade for kids.  Nice pool area though.

When we asked why they were missing, the desk staff told us that people kept stealing them so they just took them out.

While it's off the strip, with a 20-25 minute walk from the Rio Hotel to Bill's Casino, Paris, and the Bellagio, there is a shuttle that runs every 20-30 minutes from the Rio to Harrrah's and Balley's.

Rooms are nice and spacious.  Standard hotel room with double queen beds but also includes a sofa and more floor space as their ""suite"". The bathroom area has two separate sinks which is nice when you have multiple people getting ready. 

I especially enjoyed the Voodoo Lounge\/Club for the rooftop views,  the spacious pool areas, and the Carnival World Buffet.

PROS:
* Inexpensive
* Clean, spacious rooms with two sinks
* Refrigerator and great views
* Attentive Room service and Cleaning Crew. 
* 20-25 minute walk to main strip
* Frequent shuttle service to main strip
* Decent 15 minute entertainment with the ""Show in the Sky""
* Voodoo Lounge\/Dance Club in the same building for great roof top views. 
* Great Beach and pool area, with music, multiple pool and Jacuzzi areas. 
* Carnival World Buffet is excellent

CONS
* The air does get a little dry, but it wasn't terrible to any extent for our group.  
* Would like to see updated TV's (but not in Vegas to watch TV). 
* Didn't win anything at the tables.

The Rio is about a mile off the strip, but the walk to the strip isn't too bad. Well we did go when the weather wasn't too hot. It would be killer during the summer. There are free shuttles that will take you to the strip too.

The rooms are clean but dated, they charge you for every little thing (as does most hotels in Las Vegas), the location isn't the best (it's definitely OFF Strip).  The amenities left a lot to be desired -- the pool was being painted (even though I was there all week saw zero work being done each time I passed by), the spa isn't super impressive.  Food is just ""meh,"" as is the super smokey casino (have you guys heard of ventilation?!).

I did think the staff was just ""so-so"", especially the reception staff.  While checking in, I was called ""sir"" (ehm, ok), she apologized and said it was ""habit"" when greeting her guests.  Another gal said right away ""Whoa, SOMEONE'S sensitive,"" which took me by surprise.  Suddenly, I felt like it was high school or the trailer park, couldn't figure out which one.

Free valet parking (as most hotels in LV are), they charge you a ""resort fee"" if you want to use the pool, and internet is $13.95 per day, per device.  They nickle and dime you to death, but every hotel in LV does this, so be prepared.

The perks: there's a great ""Wine Cellar"" wine bar downstairs that has lovely wines to choose from and a sassy older lady that'll keep you on your toes.

Let's start with check-in. They never have enough people at the check in desk, so enjoy a long wait. Also, if you booked a king bed, be prepared to fight for it as they never have any. They pull this:

Clerk: You wanted non-smoking?
Me: Yes
Clerk: We have no more kings in non-smoking.
Me: Fine, smoking then.
Clerk: Oh, we actually don't have any kings in smoking either.
Me: But I paid for a king suite.
Clerk: Yeah, you should have been here sooner.

BTW, this was 3:15, :15 after check-in times, and that was after :15 wait in line. When they pull this, if you want your room, you need to make a scene. They have the king, they just want you to take the double. If you ask for the manager and threaten to write a Yelp review with his name in it, you'll get your room. They lie.

Let's talk the room itself. Think less nice hotel, and more fair motel. Dated is a word one reviewer used. I prefer the term, garage sale. The furniture kinda matches. And the art on the wall was clearly picked out, and painted by a blind person

Let's talk minibar. Three dollar cans of coke no longer shock me, but three dollar cokes in the hallway vending machine kinda does. Also, cans, not bottles. One nice thing here is they have a minifridge in the room, so BYO(whatever) and save a bit. Also, beware the juice in the minibar. Check those dates on the bottle or you may have a nasty surprise like I did. 

Moving on the Internet: Did you enjoy browsing AOL in '96? Then you'll love browsing at the Rio! When it works. And if you call the number for assistance, be prepared for a pointless conversation with a think accented Indian named ""Jeff"". Tip: Use Chrome to connect initially here. Every other browser chokes on the load up page. I swear that's the only way I get it to work.

No complaints about the beds, other than they could use an upgrade. 

Room service is not too slow, which is good, since the food is not worth the wait. The Caesar salad is about as lifeless as the man himself, and the rest of the menu is uninspired. Seriously, it's the worst room service food I've had in Vegas, keep in mind, I live here. 

The restaurants are sub-par at best. The All-American Bar and Grille is where the room service comes from, so eating there is like going to see a band who's CD sucked, with the added benefit of fairly rude servers. KJ Dim Sum and Seafood falls somewhere between Panda Express and PF Changs, except at higher prices and worse service. I will say this, the servers are entertaining. The ""walls"" in the restaurant are portable, kinda, and I watched three servers try to rearrange them. It was like an Asian episode of The Three Stooges. The walls collapsed on them twice. 

We'll talk gaming. I'm not a big gambler, but I'll occasionally throw $20 - $40 into a machine after dinner because I'm too dumb not to. Remember when we talked about the1996 Internet? Well that's the last time this place purchased a new machine. Those cool touch screen machines that all other casinos have? Well, they keep it old school here. Also, worst odds and tightest slots anywhere in town. Why do you think the room's are so cheap? 

And management: Here's the thing, I live here. So these places to me are not just vacation spots, I frequent them. So when something is not right, I'll let them know. I try to be cool about it, as I know whatever problem I'm having is not the direct fault of the person I'm speaking to. Usually what happens is a decent conversation about the problem, they comp me something small, admit they could do better in that area and we part buddies. I have never seen more apathetic management than those at the Rio. They seem like the place could burn to the ground and they wouldn't care. Seriously, everyone from the cocktail waitresses right up to the managers act like they were drafted to work here and can't wait to be released. 

Case in point: I called down because the Internet, that I paid for, was down. I asked to speak to a manager and after 10 minutes on hold and calling back twice, was told there was nothing they could do. That's cool, not in that the Internet was down, but I get that if it's their service provider, not much the manager can do other than call them. So the manager apologized (kinda). I asked if I could get a refund on the Internet since it's not working. He said sure and that he'll just refund my Resort Fee. That was three weeks ago, and still nothing. 

In short, not worth the money. It may seem cheap, but you'll end up paying more and getting less than other, nicer casinos. Hope this helps.",5,7,0

Yeah, in the old suites you can watch someone shower through this window. Kinda weird when you're sharing a room with your buds. If you got the package, shit, you got nothing to be shy about right?

We brought our own wine to the hotel, and when we got the room we called down for wine glasses and a cork screw.  We were charge $3 for each of these items.

It's definitely an older property.  The building itself is actually pretty nice, although it's off the strip, and while it's not in new condition, is maintained pretty well.  The casino is quite smoky compared to most others in Vegas -- the HVAC is definitely not up to the standard of the newest hotels.

There isn't a really obvious theme to the casino; it's nominally about rio and carnival and parties, but it seems to be ""1980s\/1990s vegas casino"" more than anything else -- it doesn't do badly, it's just that it's kind of bland.

The rooms vary; the refurbished rooms in the smaller (Ipanema) tower are great, but the rooms in the main or masquerade tower, especially if not refurbished, are a bit worn.

Aside from the buffet (which is quite good, and on par with Spice Market at Planet Hollywood; an especially good deal with the Harrah's Buffet of Buffets), I wouldn't really consider the Rio's dining establishments and bars to be great; adequate if you're staying in the hotel, but not a destination in themselves (unlike various eateries and bars at the Wynn, Bellagio, City Center, etc.).

I didn't gamble much, but from what I did play (maybe 1-2h of craps), I wasn't overly impressed by the casino; $10 minimum bets on craps almost all the time ($5 would have been more appropriate off-strip), and some of the dealers made mistakes, or didn't catch player mistakes, although the box man and pit boss quickly resolved all disputes in the player's favor.

This hotel is an EXCELLENT value for conventions -- if I were looking for a venue for a convention, large meeting, or other event which brought its own theme, the Rio would be my first choice in Las Vegas for anything but the highest budget events.

My favorite part of the hotel was the staff -- even for Las Vegas, they were quite friendly, helpful, and well informed.  During large events they're a bit understaffed (this seems to be common in Las Vegas overall now, due to the recession), but while there were delays at the busiest periods (e.g. Sunday valet and bell service), they were great.",0,0,0

I called ahead of time to ensure I'd be able to check in earlier than the standard 4pm check in time, as I had a conference call for work and needed a quiet spot with reliable wifi. They assured me that this would not be a problem. So I booked the room.

I get there around 11am the day of and go to check in - they tell me there's no early check in. I speak with someone else and she tells me I have to pay $20 to check in early. Okay, no big deal, would have been nice to know when I called to ask about it earlier though. Kinda feels like I'm being nickel and dimed.

We get to the room and go to unload our groceries - the refrigerator isn't working. I had to call their service department to get it fixed.

Broken tiles on the bathroom floor. No k-cups in the room. Why put a keurig machine in the room? In isolation these are not major issues, but when you add them all up...

On top of all that, I had to leave Vegas earlier than expected, so I didn't need the second night on my reservation at the Rio. I was hoping to get some of my money back, or at least a credit for my next visit. I went to the service desk and they told me to call the booking agency. I spent quite a long time on the phone with the booking agency, who had me on hold while they called the service desk... Only to tell me that they have a no refund policy on day-of reservations, regardless of the circumstances. Not even a credit for my next trip? Bummer.

When I checked in, I was upgraded to the VIP floor. When we checked in we realized our carpet was extremely wet. We were worried a water pipe might be leaking so when I called down stairs we had someone come up to check our floor. Juan, the gentleman who insisted us was extremely sweet and helpful when trying to figure out what the best solution was when he realized the carpet was in fact really wet. I had slipped on the marble because of the residue from my shoe walking in the wet carpet. Juan explained to us he could offer to dry the carpet or we could call to see if we could get another room. I didn't want to wait for the carpet to dry because it wasn't a guarantee it would be dried right away so we went downstairs to get another room. We were given a room 13 floors lower and when we went to check our room it wasn't anything that I had paid for!! I paid for a strip view and instead got a mountain view with a horrifically looking bedroom. So i went back downstairs and demanded to speak to a manager because I was so upset. The supervisor insisted me and offered me to give me another room on the 9th floor. When I asked her why I couldn't stay on the VIP floor she said it was sold out which I found hilarious because the guy who initially got us that room had no problem booking us there to begin with. Anyway, now I'm waiting for our bellman to move our luggage and at this point the only person I can say who has been helpful in all this has been Juan our custodian guy.

The water was barely warm during the morning and evenings so we couldn't shower unless we planned to shower at a time where no one in the rooms near us were showering.

Our luggage was brought up to us and the bellboy was very helpful in giving us some recommendation in and out of the casino for dining and shows.

After the second day, we had our room cleaned and towels replaced and came back to see that the change we accidentally left out (about 20-30 dollars) and a nintendo DS was still in our room.

I ended up playing mostly blackjack and craps and decided prior to our trip that i was going to make the most out of this vacation so i was very pleased to see the waitress coming 4-5 mins after i ordered my drink and the person taking orders came by every 15 mins. As far as I can remember, they were on time or a couple mins late each round and we ordered EVERY round lol.

Buffet was delicious of course but I remember them serving crab legs that didn't crumble on you the last time I ate here. Ribs and Prime rib were mm mmm mmmm!

Only thing missing from this place is the lack of activity in the Masquerade section. We brought our kids so we were expecting to see that show every hour or be able to hang out at McFaddens but the bar was closed (permanently?) and no shows happened for a few days.

When me and my girlfriend checked in, we were offered an upgrade if we wanted to pay extra so we took it hoping to enhance our experience. When we got up to the room, I could have thought it was a joke. It was one of the ugliest rooms I had ever seen. It did not look like a classy hotel as they make it out to be at all. They told us it had just been renovated, yet the furniture was old, stained, chipped. There was poop on our windows and they were so dirty we could hardly see the view. It was not very clean and it smelled of smoke even though we requested non-smoking. 

After complaining, the only thing they offered us was a DOWNGRADE. How is that any better? After some pushing the subject, they allowed us to switch rooms, but even though this one didn't smell as bad, it was still not very nice or clean. In addition, the shower pressure practically rips your skin off, you can hear the pounding music at night from the club above, the walls are paper thin, they have poor customer service and somewhat rude staff. The maid service was also poor. I left a good tip and all she did was make the bed. Two separate times, she came in before knocking and one of the times I was naked. She proceeded to then walk into the room (after saying hi) an then check something in the mini fridge and then left. I couldn't believe it!

We are locals who went for a staycation.  We booked a strip view room in the new tower. When I checked in, I gave the front desk clerk 50 dollars cash, and kindly asked for an upgrade if available. She looked and said she gave us a very nice room overlooking the strip. When we got to the room we realized that it was the exact same room that we booked online.  Ok, if you can't do an upgrade, that's cool.. But don't take the 50 dollars. That was grand larceny. We checked with he same clerk e next day, and she still didn't upgrade us. Please be forewarned.

The room was ok, the sad part was dodging the time share scam at the elevators each time we went out.. Walking through the ghost town of a ""Masquerade Village"" was just depressing. The shuttered store fronts, the empty casino, it's sad to see. Hurrahs refuses to spend money to improve the property.

There is a nice choice of restaurants, and they do have a GREAT seafood buffet.  The free show in the casino has ""floats"" that hang from the ceiling with dancers  who throw beads like in New Orleans during Mardi Gras.

If I had my choice of ANY other hotel, this one is not on the top of the list, but a nice experience when it comes to trying out what is in Vegas.",0,0,0

The couch, coffee table, desk, and bathroom was very well spread out.  The furniture and beds certainly have had better days but if square footage and elbow room is what you are looking for, then Rio covers this in spades.  Having two sinks in the bathroom was nice but no fan inside the shower\/toilet room.  Wireless internet and 3G coverage on AT&T was crappy from our 5th floor room.  I have a theory that hotels weaken 3G coverage to force guests to buy their wireless internet...watch and find out one day when I get proof!

Love their center bar with the dancing hosts and all.  The Masquerade part with the open ceiling was nicer than the cramped gambling area inside where the ceiling was super low.  The self parking lot was a quite bit away from the casino.  I parked on the 2nd floor and walked to the casino entrance from the ground level.  They also have a 4th floor walkway as well but I didn't want to bother going down an escalator just to get to my car.

Gambling wise, no cheap tables here even during the early early morning hours.  The waitresses here were pretty good about drink orders.  During peak times, they used iPads to take down our orders.  

For $120 per night, no resort fees(big plus), I can certainly do worse for a Saturday and Sunday visit.

As we were resting to decompress and get ready for a long day of tours next day, an super loud alarm with high decibels, inside our room, starts making noise. I jumped from my bed and ran as soon as I could to the door because I thought it was a fire. I get nervous and my I feel my pressure going down due to flashbacks. THe alarm doesn't stop and it keeps saying to hold on. I worried so much, i dialed 0 and ask for answers. They don't know about it. I called again, they say someone was smoking marijuana as the super loud alarm doesn't even allow me to hear properly. I get desperate. This alarm lasts from 12:30 am to 1 am on a monday night. I ask them to please send me an in house doctor because i'm sweating and I feel about to faint. THey say they don't have doctors. After 3 times they put me on hold, they transfer me to security and confirm they don't know what to do. 

I speak to security and explain the situation. I explain I don't have alcohols, meds, or drugs in my system. I tell them i need help. They send the ambulance. The ambulance comes at around 1:30 am after the security guard gets in to our room. The paramedics test me and recommend to be taken to the hospital by ambulance because my blood pressure is not normal. I go to a local hospital. They keep me awake until 5 am and conclude that I had ACUTE ANXIETY for the first time in my life. All my records are clean. They give me heavy duty tranquilizers and more. I paid a cab back to the hotel. All of this, with my own money. 

I ask to speak to the manager the same day at around 8 pm. The first thing that comes of her mouth is: the hotel does not offer compensation but you are more that welcome to fill out a report. I tell her that the negligence emotional distress was caused by the hotel. I filled their insider report. They tell me call this 1800 number, but I doubt they will give you anything.

We ended up paying hundred of dollars in their hotel, buffets, stores, resort fees, and more and got treated NOT LIKE GUESTS, but like dogs who carry money to waste.

Don, the shoe-shine guy from Goodfellows Shoeshine was a cool chap and was pretty reasonable ($8 with a free repolish the next day).

I won $190 on the bonus poker slot machines.  Yes, yes, I know, the odds are horrible on that machine and very much unfair, but all in all, I still enjoy that slot machine game for some reason.

Word of Warning:  Do not use the slot machines between 1am and 4am.  I am convinced that the payoffs of the slots automatically go down sharply.

The casino was cool and I like that there are random Chippendale men roaming around trying to get you to come to their shows. 

The pools are really nice, they have different temperatures for your dipping pleasure. The waitresses were fast with my very weak drinks (order beer or wine) and there was a DJ spinning ( really weirdly annoying mix from like Guns and Roses to Hip Hop)  as I soaked up some desert rays...ahhhhh I love my job.

The Voodoo Lounge was also cool. I was in sort of a sleep deprived weird zombie state but they had a live cover band inside that was pretty damn good and outside DJ L1 was doin her thing. The view is amazing! It was really windy but the experience is just too cool to be up there. Met some great boys from New York and noticed that really no one was dancing.

Apparently we weren't when we booked what was told to us be a four-star hotel.  Really?  I think 3-star would have been plenty generous.  

How can they still call these rooms suites??  The last time I stayed here, the rooms were REAL suites.  And no, it wasn't when I was 10 years old and things maybe seemed bigger when you're smaller.  I was an adult, though a poor college student.  Our room this time was half the size of what a suite should be. What a rip.

I call into question the cleanliness of the facilities.  When we arrived we saw a lot of debris in the hallway - our room was at the end so we saw it all.  This included a piece of smashed bread in front of a particular ""suite"" that stayed there for another day before it was cleaned up.  We woke up the next morning to see a suspicious looking Rio shopping bag in front of our door (prob filled with barf based on the celebratory noises that woke us up in the wee hours) that stayed there for most of the day as well.

On top of that, it doesn't appear that there's any security....at other mid-grade hotels, they at least have someone checking room keys before letting you up the elevators.  I guess they assume here, you'd have to be staying here to want to go up to the rooms.  

The old adage you get what you pay for is definitely evident here:  early early morning drunken pounding on doors, smelly shower curtains that maintenance never replaced at the behest of THEIR OWN MAIDS, smokey casino and all.",8,0,0

I have been coming to the Rio for over 20 years. I was here when the masquerade tower just opened and had the hottest night club in Vegas. They had the best buffet back then too...

I know there are always newer and greater casinos that will come and go but Harrahs needs to understand that you can't cut back on everything and expect tons of people to still show up!

For those of you that don't know, the Rio had an amazing FREE show- Carnival in the Sky that was totally discontinued about a year ago! People loved it and came here just to see it. Then after, they would do some gambling, eat food and spend money in the shops. Now that area is totally dead! I spoke to many of the employees and they are unhappy about it too and saw a major drop in business!

Another disappointment was at the iBar. They got rid of the dancers that came on stage every so often. It made the place cool and hip to hang out and buy drinks!  Now it's just a regular bar with expensive drinks and I probably won't be spending my money there anymore. 

Now for the good... Rooms are large with lots of room for 5 or more people if u need it.  You get a lot more room for your money compared to the strip. This is the main reason I still come here but not sure after all the cutbacks. However they do charge a resort fee and will charge you for an early check in! I was charged $10 to check in 2 1\/2 hrs early. 

Buffet is still good but very pricy now at around $33\/person for dinner on a weekend.  Hash House had the best breakfast and lunch. They hit a homerun with this place!!! See my review for more info on that. 

Pool is decent for families with kids. But not great for the young party crowd. I believe there are 4-5 pools all together but one is a 21 and older only. 

Casino has lots of table games that have lower limits than what you can typically find at the high end casinos on the strip. There is also no shortage of slot machines either.

I recently stayed at the Rio while I was playing in the WSOP Main Event. I must say that this was a very disappointing experience and not one I was expecting from a Total Rewards Casino.

When I arrived in the afternoon I waited in line for over 45 minutes to talk to the front desk to check-in and there was no room available for me, even though I booked one over 6 months in advance. The individual working was very rude and not willing to help. Once I got a manager she said they were cleaning a room and would text me in 30 minutes when it was available. about 90 minutes later I went back down to the front desk to check on my room as I had not received any text.

I was staying on the 15th floor which I was assured was not pet friendly yet there was a Dog barking throughout the night. I called the front desk to let them know of this and they didn't do anything to help.

Also, my fiancee ordered a basket for me which was a surprise and I did not receive until Tuesday. They said it was sitting there for a few days. I don't understand why it was not delivered promptly to my room.

Notes
- Out-dated Hotel
- Dirty Rooms and Pool Area
- Slow and Rude Staff
- Terrible Customer Service

Upon check in, they decided to upgrade us from a regular room to a large suite for no extra cost. It was a one bedroom suite with two bathrooms and a living room. Separating the main bathroom from the bedroom was a large soaking tub. It was a cool layout and plenty of room all around, but the interior was dated. It had that old '80s hotel room look that desperately needs an update.

They've got several pools on property. One was a zero entry pool with sand and a waterfall that was popular with kids and families. There was plenty of room to layout and we didn't have a problem snagging a few chairs in the late morning. Like their hotel rooms, the pool area could use a refresh and a better filtering system for the pools because the water looked excessively oily and dirty.

We were not disappointed. My boyfriend and I checked into the Rio at 8pm on Saturday night. The self parking garage was easy to navigate and convenient. We parked on the top floor of the garage which had a beautiful view of the strip, and there were plenty of parking spaces available on a Saturday night. We waited in a very short line to check in. The front desk had us in a room with 2 queen beds and, when I stated that we had requested a king bed, they quickly switched us into a room with a king.

We stayed in a deluxe room in the Ipanema tower. It was a spacious and clean room with a king bed, desk, sofa and coffee table, large flat screen TV, mini-fridge, and a private bathroom and vanity area that was nicely separated from the rest of the room. There was a Kuerig coffee machine (with coffee pods for sale in the minbar for about $3 or $4 each) and a mini bar which we never even opened. We had a tremendous view of the strip from our room overlooking the Rio pool area. The pool was closed, but it was February and most of the pools in Vegas are closed in the winter. There was a free shuttle to the strip that drops off at the Paris\/Bally's or the Harrah's casinos. We waited about 10 minutes for the shuttle each way and were pleased with the service. We didn't gamble or try any of the restaurants at the Rio, although we did get coffee each morning at the Starbucks on the ground floor of our tower.

The Penn and Teller show was top notch and the theater was really nice!

Cons: The internet in our room was equipped with ethernet cables which we were unable to use since we had iPhone and iPad devices. There may have been wi-fi, but we couldn't seem to access or sign into it so we gave up and just used our iPhone service. There were no usb ports in the room for charging devices either, and we neglected to bring one since most of the nicer hotels have charging ports in the lamp bases, etc. The $20 resort fee seems ridiculous, but even the crappiest hotels on the strip have a ""resort"" fee, so we just accepted it as part of the real price of the room.

Overall, we would definitely stay at the Rio hotel again. We enjoyed staying off the strip because it was easier to navigate traffic and parking, and more intimate and quieter than the strip.

The casino floor has everything to offer, the tables were great and reasonably priced for playing, the restaurants including the buffet are all one of the best in Vegas.

(The Good, the bad, and the Beautiful)

I know, I know. A riff on an old spaghetti western is an odd theme for a Brazilian themed hotel, but try to play along...

The Good - It's spacious. I like a room that does not feel like I'm being put into storage for the night. All that space also allowed for extra wall outlets. Now, I'm probably not unusual here, but when I travel, I bring a laptop, an iPad, a cellphone, and my wife. While she does not need to be plugged in, she also packs a cellphone, and a tablet. We may be a little more tech-geeky than the norm, because she also has a work cell and a work iPad. That's 5-7 wall outlets needed for charging devices, and the Rio delivers here - without unplugging lamps (that you will forget to plug back in for the next guest).

The water pressure is the shower is great. Strong enough to blast all of that sunscreen off of you as you head into evening.

They have an in room coffee maker. Now if you've ever seen ""The Good , The Bad, and the Ugly"", you would know that Clint Eastwood (the Good) wasn't all that good...

The Bad - The coffee maker uses K-Cups, which you have to purchase from the mini-bar, 3 for $8. Oh, and the mini bar wouldn't open. It wasn't locked, just broken shut. I mean really, you theme your hotel as Brazilian, yet I cannot get coffee?

The room is old. The hotel was opened in 1990, so it appears that the room was 10 years out of date when it opened. It is also falling into disrepair. The sliding shower door has no handle on the inside, just the screws where the handle used to be. One of the shower doors is also off the track making it very hard to move that door.

The shower-head is noisy. It sounds like a rocket taking off. If you thought you would take a shower while your room-mate slept, you were sadly mistaken (unless they are not disturbed by the aquatic NASA launch in the next room). You may also want to take that early shower with the lights off, because there is a window between the bathroom shower and the sleeping quarters, so when you turn on the bathroom light, you are effectively lighting up both beds.

You're kind of trapped in the Rio. It's about a 45 mile walk from our room in the Masquerade tower to the doors out of the hotel. You have to navigate through the casino spotted with smokers, who stop in the walkways because that's where they put the ashtrays. Then you have a maze-like parking lot you have to hoof around to get to the street, where you are bound realize that your clean shirt now smells like you just rolled around in an ashtray. From here, you have a choice - just under a mile walk in the desert sun to reach the strip (and then some, unless your walk to the strip was to watch the traffic at Flamingo and Las Vegas Blvd), or a 1\/2 mile trek to the Palms. We opted for the Palms, but found that 117 degree weather sucks for a leisurely stroll past vacant lots, abandoned buildings, and the Gold Coast hotel\/casino. They do offer a shuttle to the strip, but given how the rooms and casino were, I really did not trust the shuttle.

The Beautiful - The view. When on vacation, especially in a late-night town like Las Vegas, It is important to have blackout curtains. But the view of the city lights was so magnificent, I left them open every night. During the day, I could see the mountains in the distance, as well as from the shower\/launch pad.",1,0,0

To top that off when they finally gave us a room, still with only one bed, none of the keys we got worked! So we wasted more time going back down to the lobby to get keys that actually worked.

This was the hotel that my husbands team stayed out during their most recent hockey tournament in Vegas. The rooms are all suites so the single guys were able to bunk up and the couples had enough room to spread out away from all the stinky hockey gear. Plus, they provided discounted rooms for just over $100 a day so perfect for those on a budget. The rooms and the facilities aren't all that bad either so if you can get past that, you'll be ok.

They do have a work out facility but you have to either pay for a treatment at the spa OR spend $25 to use the gym. You also have to pay for wi-fi. The spa is ok but don't expect anything super luxurious - just comfortable (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/rio-spa-and-salon-las-vegas#hrid:LOKuIdrMxaY8xiUAvHcGug).

I stayed here only due to a convention I was attending. It rained the night after we checked in and we woke in the morning to sodden floors and water running down the large window.

After some arguing the hotel moved us to another room. Seriously we had to argue. Apparently they expected us to stay in the room with sodden carpets and a leaking window.  Hotel amenities close promptly at 7pm clearly they think they are in Florida half the population of the hotel doesn't even get out of bed until then

Restaurants also close ridiculously early. Some as early as 1pm. Even with 3000 convention attendees checking in the hotel didn't put extra staff on check in causing the line to take hours at both check in and check out. 

I was locked out of my room in two separate occasions due to a faulty door. This is the only thing the hotel felt the need to apologize for. After much protesting that they couldn't comp me anything (of course they can its Vegas) they finally caved and comped two nights off my resort fees. That's what you get when you loose access to your room for ten hours. Then when I checked out they tried to charge me for the resort fees they had comped me. 


There was an elevator that kept dropping and engaging and he emergency brakes. We nicknamed it the elevator of death. Even though we reported it the lift was still dropping on the day we checked out.

The convention area is 0.8 miles from the casino floor making ideal for any kind of fitness convention but probably not anything that may include the elderly or handicapable folks. My Fitbit read over 40 miles on one particularly busy day.

I chose the hotel because the price was a little cheaper than the strip hotels (and Palms). The little bit we saved was not worth the grief we experienced - LESSON LEARNED! 

Upon check-in, the reserved non-smoking room smelled like cigarette smoke and featured 2 ashtrays. The room looked as if it hadn't been updated since the hotel was built - old furnishings, outdated look, and everything desperately needed repair, including the lovely duct tape plastered atop the windows in the room. The wi-fi didn't work, even though we entered the exact information they told us to at check-in. Oh, and the fridge wasn't stocked with things (albeit severely overpriced) you could buy (hello, it's Vegas!!). 

When we went to bed, around 1:00am or so, the neighbors were excessively loud. They were screaming, yelling, fighting - it all sounded like it was happening at the foot of our bed. The walls are SUPER thin. I know it's Vegas, but I'd still like to sleep at some point. I called the front desk - well, I tried to, but the phone beside the bed didn't work. So, I used the other phone. For the noise, they sent security up (it worked a little, but we could still hear the neighbors). For the wi-fi problems, they connected me to an unhelpful tech support number. I'm sorry, I didn't realize I came to Vegas to pay a $32.48 per night ""resort fee,"" and still have to do the hotel's job of figuring out why the wi-fi doesn't work! Tech support said it was the hotel's fault, the hotel said it was tech support. 

The next day, I found out that the hair dryer didn't work. Frustrated, I went downstairs and complained. They switched our room from the 8th floor to the 21st. The room smelled better and was a little nicer, but everything was still outdated. Plus, we had a nice welcome gift in the form of a pill in the center of the bathroom floor, which housekeeping somehow missed.

The reservation came with a $25 food and beverage credit, good for all but 2 of the restaurants in Rio. We used it for breakfast at Hash House A Go Go. They also gave us issues - because no stay at the Rio would be complete without issues - and had to call someone before they were able to use the credit. Nothing is easy here. 

The front desk told me that my resort fees would be removed due to my less than stellar experience and continued issues with the wi-fi, which never worked. Apparently, they didn't note this on my account. Since the charges are still on there, I called the Rio today. I was transferred from guest services, to billing, and then back to guest services - all because there wasn't a note on my account saying the resort fees would be removed. The final lady spoke with a Rio manager, Will, who agreed to remove ONLY ONE resort fee. Really?? So, I guess in Will's opinion, the other $64.96 I paid in resort fees for the disgusting rooms and NO wi-fi was worth it?! Never again.

PROS:
1. Friendly staff.  Literally every single person we interfaced with (hotel front desk, convenience store clerk, on site restaurant staff, pool servers, etc) was executing their role perfectly.  Friendly, personable.  They give good service here.
2. Trash Can Nachos at El Burro Barracho. Don't miss these.  Diet, schmiet.  You're in Vegas.  Do it.
3. Pools (Over 21 Pool specifically) - I was nervous going to the over 21 pool because I am welllll over 21.  I thought it might be a meat market.  What I found instead was people from every walk of life just chillin' and having a good time.  I never felt uncomfortable.  I never felt too old, too heavy, too unhip, too whatever to just go have a great time.  Very cool vibe.  And DJ Too Tall is the bomb.  Also the Rio has 3 other pools which are great for kiddos...so it definitely has pools going for it.  But heads up - if you don't plan on getting a cabana, get there before 11am or you'll be out of luck for a lounge chair.
4.  Rooms are huge and affordable.
CONS:
1. Off the strip - so don't even think about walking in the heat with the exhaust fumes of passing cars, yuck.  You have to wait 5-20 minutes to take the shuttle which can get crowded at times.  It lets you off at Harrahs, which may or may not be close to what you want to go see....IMO, being off the strip is just a big hassle.  
2.  We went in May 2017.  At that time I had read Trip Advisor reviews about theft being an issue at the hotel.  I would definitely agree with that.  Since I read those reviews, I always kept my cash on me, never left valuables in our room or cabana - and I didn't have a problem.  Can't say the same for the cabana of 3 dudes next to us.  The dudes in our party never left the cabana the whole time and the only people we saw go into the cabana next to us were cocktail servers.  Still, one of those guys got his wallet stolen.  It was found 2 hours later in Lost & Found missing $250.  Mmm hmm.

I haven't stayed at the Rio in so long. But we were all there this weekend. Compared to the Westin in Vegas...this hotel rocks though! LOL!

Rooms, not bad. Bigger ""suite"" rooms with fridge and such. The two wings (Impanema and Masquerade) are kind of far from each other though. 

Need more $10 Blackjack tables for the poor folks like me. 

Even though the hotel is off the strip, they still provide shuttles to Harrah's and Caesars. 

They do need more fast food restaurants in the hotel though (the BK doesn't cut it). 

Elevators and some areas need a touching up though.

Rooms that I've had comped are dated and in disrepair. I'll pay for my room at Orleans before I stay in a beat-up ""suite"" at Rio.

The things that I knew from previous casino floor visits and\/or general presumptions were relevant - It's a bit off the main strip, it's an older hotel, and some elements seen around and about are understandably rather dated and worn.

However, during my stay I experienced exceptional service; in some ways exceeding that of the finer, newer, far more expensive hotels found on the strip.  It might not seem like much, but think about the last time you had the following offered at other Las Vegas resorts:

-  Bottles of water were given to EVERYONE waiting in line to check in.
-  The maid cheerfully greeted me in the hallway as I made my way to my room.
-  On the way from my room to the elevator the next morning, bottles of water were offered once again by a polite gentleman employee who declined tips.

There are 2 buffets inside the Rio - the carnival world buffet and the seafood buffet. The carnival one was just your average everything buffet. Don't expect anything too great. I love their seafood buffet though! 

If you want to catch a show, Penn and Teller performs there and you can get a nice discount for tickets since you're staying at the Rio.

Upon arrival, my dad (he was the person under the reservation) checked in. There was a huge like with 20+ people and also only about 6-8 registration desks open. 

The check-in person let us know that the room was not prepared for 4 people... although we upgraded our room 4 weeks before arrival. Since it wasn't prepared we had to pay an extra fee for the staff to ""prepare"" the room for 4 people.

We went up to the room and noticed that our bathroom had only 2 shampoos, lotions, soaps. My family and I always bring those extra items but why charge us to prepare our room if it won't be ready? Our closet door was broken and we had to call for it to be fixed. We called at about 3:30 or maybe even 4pm. We could not open our closet or put any things inside until it was fixed. We waited about 3 hours and nobody showed up, except the shampoos showed up 30 mins later. We left to explore the strip, came back at 1 AM and found the closet fixed.

We were setting up our things and my brother stood on top of the bed and noticed there was cigarette packs and trash on top of the wardrobe where the TV and mini fridge go! YUCK!!

At check out, on Sunday, there was also a huge line yet this time it was even longer than Thursday when we arrived! There was about 50 people in line this time, MAYBE even more! There was only 3 registration desks open. When we complained about the trash in the room the person only said ""I'm sorry to hear that, I will let the maintenance know to check the room."" We then spoke to a ""manager"" over the phone. The ""manager"" said sorry and they hope we can find a better experience next time. When we said we will not be back they did not say anything.

Customer service at the front desk is WHACK! 

The ""free shuttles"" run every 30 mins but you must be a reward member. Get that the first day! Also if you want to take the shuttle arrive early! If there is no more room you have to wait another 30 mins to load a different shuttle.

Overall, my experience was okay, but not worth anything over 2 Stars. 

Pool was neat, 3 or 4 pools. One is heated.

Casino is just like any other casino, nothing special.

The zip line going from one building to the other of the hotel was a nice touch. You must be 18+ and over 48"" to ride. After 10:30 it is only 21+. We went on Saturday and it was a 60-120 Minute wait since there was high winds. (Not their fault so that doesn't affect my rating)

I have always enjoyed myself at The Rio. I would start my day next door at The Gold Coast Hotel. They have a great breakfast buffet at a good price, if you're a B Connect players club member. 

I used to eat a coffee and almond croissant at a little bakery\/cafe The Rio used to have a few years ago, but the got rid of it. They didn't ask me, or I would've told them to keep it. 

However, I eat all of my other meals at The Rio. I eat lunch at the food court\/deli next to the Sportsbook. They have a variety of food to choose from. I get something to eat, buy a drink, and enjoy a game... or two.

For dinner, I eat at the All-American Cafe. I always order the same thing-prime rib with mash potatoes and asparagus-because it's so good and I don't want anything else. But my other family members say, what they've eaten is good as well. 

After dinner, I hit the tables. The action is centrally located, so the excitement and energy is concentrated in the center of the casino. As a regular card player, I can tell you, I've always felt that I've gotten a fair shake at The Rio... I've won quite a bit and lost my fair share as well, but never felt cheated and had a GREAT TIME in the process. 

At 3am, when I go to bed, I get to go back to one of the largest STANDARD rooms in Las Vegas. I love all the space, the comfortable bed, the spacious couch with a coffee table and TV. You can practically have a party in your room, but why would you with all of the action downstairs. 

The ONLY thing I don't like about The Rio is that it's not on the strip and if it wasn't such a long and complicated walk to get to the strip, it wouldn't be such a big deal. Furthermore, I hate paying $20-25 for a taxi, every time I want to go somewhere else.

I made sure he could use part of it, play under the waterfalls etc.  Sounded great and I made the reservation.

Upon arrival TWO days after making the reservation I was told upon check in that the pool was CLOSED for the season.  The front desk person appeared not to care.  I said the ONLY reason we had chosen to stay there was because of the pool.  They would not move me to another property that had a pool or let me cancel my reservation.

I was mad and still am.

Yeah, the rooms were clean.  We all know that by ""suite"" the Rio really means big room.  Not a room with a separate bedroom and living area.  Whatever.

You can usually get rooms here at far lower rates but you don't sacrifice or miss out on anything Vegas. In fact in many ways you experience more of it. Rio gives you a glimpse of Vegas past and Vegas future.

First of all, it's off the strip, out of the way, just seemed rather inconvenient. They do offer a shuttle which takes you to Bally's or Harrah's, which is a great idea in theory. Leaving the hotel, we waited approximately 15 minutes to get the free shuttle down to Bally's. We were able to do some shopping, gambling, and dinner while on the strip. Then we decided to get the shuttle back. We lined up at Bally's and waited. And waited. And waited. After 30 minutes in the blustery cold, we opted for grabbing a cab back to Rio. The cab ride was only $10, so we decided from that point on, we would just take cabs to the strip, as it was cheap, quick, and would avoid waiting on shuttles.

Believe it or not, the only real drawback of staying at Rio was that shuttle service. I mean, it's great that they offer the shuttle...and if you don't mind spending part of your trip waiting for it to get there, then it's a great service.

The rooms were big and spacious. All had couches, chairs, refrigerators, etc in them. We had a nice view of the strip The buffet was great..we ate there each morning for breakfast, and did eat one dinner there. Dinner was a bit pricey (but we used our total rewards points). We never had to wait in a long line to be seated, and the wait staff was very attentive. This casino was within walking distance of The Gold Coast...so we did walk over there for a visit as well.

Overall we were very happy with our stay here, and we would definitely stay here again in the future.",0,0,1

My company is mostly caters to older people.  They had a lot of issues getting around.  Luckily the hotel rents out wheel chairs and electric bike chairs on an hourly and daily basis.  
We had to keep asking for water to be brought and trash to be dumped which is odd. The rooms themselves didn't have coffee pots in them or any amenities for that matter.  A couple of the days we stayed there, they took our dirty towels and left NOTHING.  No towels WTF?
The hotel itself has a big casino in the bottom of it.  You can never tell what time of day it is.  EVER.  It all looks the same.  There is also people smoking everywhere.  I myself am not use to that at all.  They do keep the fans sucking smoke out of the air going at all times.  This leads to the smoke leaving but it also dries out that air itself.

It is a good value for the money; however, you should not expect a 5 star experience. The room was in disrepair. I had to call maintenance within 10 min of our arrival because the safe didn't work. So, I had to hang out and wait for the person to come and fix it. New batteries were all that was needed. Simply having a safe check on the housekeeping checklist would have been all that was needed to avoid this problem. Next things we discovered is the hair dryer in the room didn't work. We called. No one came. We called again. No one came. We found a maid in the hallway, she called. No one came. Finally on the fourth call, a guy came and replaced the hair dryer. He also noticed the outlet was loose in the wall and put in a maintenance request for that as well. One of the mattresses in the room was completely collapsed on one side. I called about that and they offered a room change but could not guarantee the view so we elected to tough it out with the crappy bed. The alarm clock in the room next door started going off about 9pm on the first night of our stay. We called about that. It finally got turned off about 3 hours later. Hard to get kids to bed with an alarm clock going off in the next room. Our alarm clock went off in the middle of the night as well. Seems like someone thought it would be funny to set the alarms clocks to go off. Not the hotel's fault on that issue. The pool area is in an extreme state of deferred maintenance. The concrete around the edge of their sandy beach pool was cracking and the chicken wire underneath was exposed and sharp edges were visible. The material under the sand was also exposed and creating a trip hazard. We still had a good stay. The kids loved the place and didn't notice any of these issues. This is an aging property which has not been well maintained over the years. I talked to a manager about all these issues and she said she's give us a late checkout the next day and credit our account $50 for the trouble. When I went to check out the $50 had not been applied, so I had to call and talk with another manager. She increased the credit to about $60 to cover all the ""resort fees"". They charge a $24\/day resort fee for the wifi (which works very poorly) and the fitness center which is also in great need of updating. All-in-all a successful stay at the Rio.

We were greeted by a check in line that was ridiculously long, check-in kiosks that only let a select few actually check in, and quite possibly the slowest hotel front desk we've ever encountered. After almost an hour, we make it to the front only to be told that they don't have any double rooms left for the night - so they offer to upgrade us and waive the resort fee for the day. My friend and I were exhausted so we agreed to share a king for the night. The woman said that she would put us on the waitlist for a double room, but that we could keep our upgraded room at no additional cost if we wanted. Despite explaining to her that we would want to get a double, she seemed insistent that we'd love our upgraded room so much that we'd want to keep it. 

We got to the room and it was old and dated. It had this terrible (or amazing, depending on your decoration preferences) pink velvet couch and seemed to be right underneath the Voodoo night club - which you could hear the loud music playing. The bathroom had this strange window that looked into the bedroom which gave my friend and I a chuckle as we both got ready to go to bed around 3:30am. At some point that night, we were awoken by loud arguments occurring in the room next door. We eventually gave up trying to sleep around 7 when we got up, had some breakfast, and headed to the pool until we could switch rooms - strangely enough, we weren't as in love with it as the front desk at 3:00am thought we would be. 

While waiting for the pool, we were approached by another hotel guest offering blow, weed, and sex. Oddly, we declined, but he let us know that he was staying in the same tower we were currently located in.... so after spending some time at the pool, we headed to the front desk to change rooms - and towers! We were moved into a double in the Ipanema tower and the room was way nicer than our ""upgraded"" room in the Masquerade tower. Once moving, our entire experience improved and we never ran into that hotel guest again. 

Overall, it was a pretty lame experience having to share a king in a room right under the night club at the Rio, but the way the staff handled it and the comps we received for the inconvenience made it worth it.",1,0,1

We stay in Vegas once a month for about a week for work. We try new spots often and hate this spot here's why.. 

Terrible food, nothing over 3.5 stars, all have weird hours nothing past 11:00 thats decent. People keep talking about the buffet but common, if you use yelp, go to a 4-5 star place please. Please don't eat at smash burger. 

Everything is outdated and sad, just look for yourself, this feels like downtown without the new vibrant scene. 

Rooms are old! Anything above the 10th floor look out. 

Front desk will tell you the upper rooms are newly renovated but that's a lie, don't switch for anything above the 10th. 

The pools are cool or could be if they were cleaned properly, why does the pearl pool have black mold everywhere? Just wondering.. common! Adult pool is cool enough, dj plays 90s jams, but could step it up with all the beautiful edm out there. 

These are things I most care about. Always looking for a clean room, delicious well made food, and a nice and clean pool. Not here, not this hotel.

The Mask tower is a DUMP. Dump like Imperial Palace, Gold Coast, Circus Circus, Riviera, I could go on. Its so outdated I honestly felt like I was living in Three's Company. I wonder what crazy situation Jack Tripper will get himself into at the Voodoo Lounge\/Regal Beagle. If you can, get the Ipanema Tower, not the Masquarade Tower. If I was in the Ip Tower I might give it 3....not sure, maybe not, I'm grouchy. 

It was my BDAY and I was an invited VIP (not because of my Bday). The whole check-in process was miserable. People who thought they were more VIPS just walk right up to the counter whenever they feel like it. 100 people saw my id and NO happy bdays! It's the same day as today! Hello can't you read! You're checking that I'm old enough!  I had to wait over 4 hours to get a room. Keep in mind that I flew from PA, was up all night or on a plane and was completely exhausted...The need a whole new front desk area. It's too confusing and annoying. Makes me want to give it 0 stars. 

Ok so redeeming quality - Room Service. Now this isn't the best food you have ever had....it's better than Denny's and more like Eat and Park for my PA friends. What would it be to the rest of America.....hmmmm.....Coco's? Marie Callenders. Whatever. Anyhow, it's open and delivering to your room 24 hours a day and almost everything is reasonably priced - much much cheaper than other hotel RS. They only charge you the $2.50 delivery charge and not the additional 17 or 18% unless you have more than 8 people in your room. 

Yes I have 5 free nights and I'm still complaining. That's how much I didn't like it. AND I am passive aggressive and don't like to complain directly to the property when I could prob get it fixed.

My wife booked us here for my birthday. When we arrived, there was only about 4 people in front of us checking in. Check in was nice and I was handed a stack of beads since it was my birthday. The room was big, in some ways it seemed too big. The trek in the middle of the night form the bed to the bathroom took a while. The room has ceiling to floor windows. We stayed on the 26th floor, and had a view of the strip. You could see from Caesar's all they way past Mandalay Bay. The bathroom had a shower\/tub, toilet, and sink. Right outside the bathroom was a changing area with another sink, closet, safe, some drawers, and a mini fridge.
The television was old school, and the picture was rather crappy. But I guess it's safe to say that I didn't travel to Vegas to watch TV. The mini bar was under the TV, but I didn't really pay much attention to it.
The casino wasn't all that impressive. It wasn't very fancy and it wasn't very large either.
We tried two of the buffets here, and I will review them in my ""cons"" section. So onto the breakdown.
PROS:
Very large room.
Friendly staff (that I encountered).
CONS:
Pool was overly crowded and the water was nasty looking.
Raw sewage smell in the casino near all the shops.
Carnival Buffet line was WAYYYYYY SLOW, and the food was mediocre.
Village Seafood Buffet-food quality was sub-par(compared to my previous visits). See my review of that.
The hotel needs some cosmetic attention, and the room decor was dated.
The Parade in the sky only runs Thursday-Sunday. I stayed there Monday-Thursday morning.

We had a pet room since I had my dog with me. First of all, it seems like they don't take care of the pet rooms because they think pets are gonna mess them up. I have a tiny dog that doesn't mess up furniture or anything, so I want a nice hotel room, not chewed corners on the couch and carpet that's coming up. Next, the room smelled horrible. I think this probably goes back to being the pet floor. My thoughts...if you have animals staying in your hotel, that floor needs extra attention from housekeeping! Seems like common sense to me. 

My biggest complaint about staying here is how inconvenient it is to get to your room. If you park in the garage, you take the elevator up to the second floor, but then have to go back to the casino floor in order to get on the next elevator to go to your room. It's the worst design ever! If you valet, it's at least a five minute walk to the elevators. (I walk fast) Being a local and not wanting to deal wth the casino, made this super annoying.

When I checked in I was impressed how fast they get you checked in. Well first thing they never explained how much there resort fee was. They put two hundred dollars on deposit for room charges which was fine and typical. It was the $28 a night resort fee that she never informed me about
OUCH!! That's way more than most places in Las Vegas. It is what it is but man that's a lot of $$. The girl didn't tell me that wifi was free and what my code was to sign on to it. I signed up agreeing to pay 9.99 the first night and the second night was $13.99. I went to the concierge to ask if the about the resort fee and get some directions. We were greeted by a young lady and there was a gentleman standing next to her looking at the computer screen. I asked how much the resort fee was because I saw it on my bank charge earlier after I signed up for the wifi. The young lady was very helpful to my girlfriend about giving her directions. The gentleman wouldn't even look at me when I asked how much the resort fee was. He must have been embarrassed at how much they charge. He just mumbled $28 a night.
The young lady told us that the wifi was free and we wouldn't be charged and
Told us the pass code. So I'm not real happy but buyer beware on me for not checking before booking the room.
We get up to the room very nice it was a suite. I see they have a coffee maker very nice BUT where's the coffee. I call housekeeping they inform me that you have to buy the coffee out of the mini bar to make coffee in the maker they provide for you $9.00. I booked as unite not just a room and no coffee?
Ok so the next morning I get up at 6am go downstairs for some breakfast. Well the place that sells breakfast doesn't open until 8am. If you want coffee get in line at the Starbucks. So no coffee shop open until 8am. 
The girlfriend and I take off to go out sight seeing come back valet the car.
Now it's time to hit the strip. It's $20 in cab fare each way with a tip.
That ads up over a weekend. Now it's time to check out. The in room check out would tell me that I get a $200 credit I only owed for the two day resort fee of $56. It wouldn't check me out. So I go to the desk check out.
I look at my bank balance and I see they charged me $256 not the $56. I called them today and was told it takes 5 to 10 days to get you $200
credited back to you. 
To sum it all up. It's not a value. Resort fees to high,customer service weak at best. No free coffee in the room. No early morning coffee shop except Starbucks. You throw in that their not on the strip so cab fares ad up.
I will never return and glad to tell friends not to either. 
I've paid less and gotten more at other places.

Sure it looks radical with its purple and red lights at night but its really a great place!!  They have many things to do if you're old enough.

Rio has many different eateries that you can try but when we go we always go to the Carnival World Buffet, locals get 50% off and even if you're not a local its still inexpensive!! I have a 5 yr old and they dont charge him, so thats nice.

Did not like: On entering, strong smell of smoke. Many other casinos can filter this out. Hit with higher fees. No coffee makers. No complimentary breakfast. WI fi is at an extra fee. TV station selection is poor. 
 Every time water is used the plumbing gurgles like a pluged up toilet - including turning on water to brush teeth. Water has a lot of minerals that will settle in any container you put it in. TV does not turn so if you are in bed or on the couch you are looking at a 45 degree angle. Note the TV is permanently mounted on a cabinet and the cabinet does not move. Conveniently located a couple hundred yards from a train track. Train is not too noisy but still woke me up over night once. Hard to figure out where elevator is up to the main floor. Eventually had to ask a food vendor with an answer ""I think you go down one flight of stairs..."" (this was from the entrance from the self parking)

Some may or may not like: Bed is good if you like firm. If you like soft, good luck. Window from bedroom to shower seems odd.

Now for the good: A friend said they liked this place. Price did not seem too bad - until they started bumping up fees significantly.  Close to the strip with a free shuttle. Convenient gambling and entertainment. I did not try their entertainment. Figured if they want to skip out on what you normally find at hotels, I will not give them more money.

This was one of the main spots the wifey and I would visit back in the day (before kids). My wife even won a video poker tourney here one time netting a cool 12K; royal flushes are possible and people do win. My wife wanted to take the money and throw it all on the bed but we took a check and some cash for fun. We spent many summer days out by the pool and have had cabanas in the past. The Rio has always been good to us and just like in the past on our most recent trip the Rio did us right. 

This time we visited during the Thanksgiving week from Sunday thru WednesdayI. Make sure to use the new self check-in kiosks. It makes the process so much quicker. On this visit we used our Total Rewards players' cards to secure us 3 complimentary nights. Unfortunately, you will still be charged a resort fee of $30\/night so I figured that was a wash for us since we had over $180 in rewards credits to use. The room was decent for us. 2 queen beds, mountain view, 10th floor. What I like about the Rio is the rooms are large. The rooms are mini-type suites. The couches and good sized desk are perfect. Plus, there is a nice lounge chair to kick up your feet. There was a refrigerator in the room but I did not figure that out until our final night. The bathroom area is great as well. Plenty of room for all your stuff and 2 sinks, one in the shower\/toilet room and the other on the outside. 

The fitness center is located in the Spa, which is across from the large Starbucks. The fitness center is included with your resort fee. There are plenty of treadmills and ellipticals, free weights, weight machines, etc. The weight area was very cramped and there was only 1 bench to use with the weights. I was able to get some good use out of the place. If you get there after 8am you might be competing for space. 

There are plenty of places to eat. The carnival world buffet is okay. I should probably do a different review for that place. Room service is not available during the day after breakfast and begins promptly at 5pm and runs til 11pm. All of the employees at the hotel were great. I enjoyed myself at the Sportsbook. Plenty of drinks as long as you are betting. Overall, it was a great time. If you are looking at being close to the strip you should probably check out a different Harrah's property. They do offer a free shuttle but I suggest grabbing an uber\/lyft back to the hotel. The uber\/lyft area is next to the free shuttle and parking garage.

Last time I was here they had the bronze statue of the naked showgirls in the lobby. The hotel has changed since then. My boyfriend and I ended up at the Rio after planning a last minute trip to Vegas. There were so many events going on that this was the closet hotel still available near the strip. 

The hotel itself is okay but nothing fantastic. The casino area was well kept but very empty. Doesn't seem like this hotel gets too crowded. On a positive note they did have a free shuttle that would drop you off at Harrah's or Bally's which are right on the strip. 

Our room was clean but there were some things that needed to be fixed. Our shower head for example was loose and halfway detached from the wall. 

Also in my opinion this hotel lacked restaurants. They had a bunch of buffets but nothing that was a quick and tasty bite. We did end up eating breakfast at one of the restaurants and it was pretty disappointing. 

Overall the Rio wasn't great but it also wasn't bad. If we needed to stay here again I wouldn't mind it but I would first try to book a room elsewhere.",1,1,0

Rio is known for their Carnival buffet (which we didn't try since i was disappointment with them), voodoo zipline, and their pool; however, the experience we receive wasn't so pleasant, therefore, we had to give them 2 stars.  

First off, their express Kiosk machine was only for a one day stay which there isn't any sign stating so and it was non-functional (very expressed of them). The registration line took about 1 1\/2 hour with 7 employees working and there were only 5 other folks in front of me. When we asked the service provider to talk to the manager about the situation, the security guard jumped in and was rude about the situation saying  ""what do you think?! You think they have magic of something to add more workers to accommodate you?""  This dude needs to stay in his lane. 

When we finally got check-in and got to our room, the room was not the room that we paid and booked for. We've paid for a strip view but got a garage view instead, so i had to go back to the registration desk to ask why they booked us in a room which didn't match our reservation. The manager tried to say that they overbooked so they couldn't put us in the reserved room... wait... it was a Wednesday, it wasn't a holiday, the casino floor was empty, and their garage was empty, why in the hell would she tell me that they ""overbooked?""  They finally told me that they can put us in the strip view the next day of our stay. I sucked it up and agreed to it. 

ROOM PROS:
Small refrigerator to store your food, good space and size. 

ROOM CONS:
Outdated room, wallpaper pealing, cracked tile floor, broken iron, missing painting on the wall, dirty and broken curtains, dirty carpet, broken AC, itchy bed-sheets, no lights over the bathtub.

I booked a 2 Queen Bed Classic Suite Mountain View room for 3 nights through Agoda. For check-in, I called for a late check-in the day of my arrival as I realized I wasn't going to get to the hotel until close to midnight. Thankfully, they were able to accommodate with my request despite the fact I called last minute. When I got there, I was able to check in through their express check-in & check-out machines. The machines are easy to use and efficient. It's similar to checking in at those kiosks you see at the airport. 

We stayed at the a room on the 3rd floor at the Ipanema Tower. The room was quite spacious as there were 2 queen size beds and couch with LOTS of floor space. For the bathroom\/pamper area, there's a shower, sink and toilet in a separate room as well as a sink and counter outside. If you think about it, this layout is ideal if you have a big group just because you can have one person showering while have someone do their makeup\/get ready outside (LOL just saying). The quality of the room was pretty decent for the most part (e.g. beds were comfy) but there were some equipment that was a little bit run down (e.g. I could barely hear the person on the line when I used their phone). I forgot to take pictures of the room but I thought the room looked like the pics that I saw when I booked on Agoda. Price wise, I think the entire booking came out close to $560 (including the daily resort fees), which was a decent price that was split among the size of group I had.

In terms of housekeeping, one thing that did caught me off guard a little bit was how early they knock on the doors (9am), which might not be ideal for those who typically stay out late in Sin City. Me and my friends actually ended up opting out of housekeeping just because we were out for the most part and we didn't really want to deal with it. As for parking, you can valet or you can park at their structure next door for free.",15,7,14

I arrived at 2 in the morning on July 1st. 
When arrived me and my boyfriend went up to the clerk desk and we asked to book a room, the employee helping us some how ""forgot"" to mention that if we booked a room at 2 am that we would be charged as if we came on June 30th. (so our 1 night stay would be 30th - 1st. Keep in mind we were planning on leaving Sunday July 2nd) She had only mentioned that our parking was free and that our check out would be Sunday. 
I had received an email Saturday at 930 to go check out on time so i was a bit confused, i went down stairs and talked to 3 different employees at the desk none of which were helpful. 1 employee kept insisting that all their rooms were booked and that she couldn't help me. She was extremely rude and unhelpful. I then asked to speak to a manager about the issue, i explained the situation and let them know that their employee at 2 am gave me the wrong information and didn't inform me correctly. (All the employees including the manager had different response for us. None of them were on the same page.) 
The manager then asked for my confirmation paper which WE DIDN'T EVEN GET FROM THE PERSON WHO BOOKED US OUR ROOM.
We were charged $250+, for staying 10 hours. The only thing the manager could ""help"" me with was a ""discount"" on a nightly rate for Saturday July 1st, of $280+. ( EVEN THOUGH WE HAD ARRIVED ON JULY 1ST AND ALREADY PAID A NIGHTLY RATE) 
After and hour talking to employees and managers we then decided to pack our things from the room and leave.

If you live in a big city center and are used to going downstairs walking half a block to bars, convenience stores and the like you might not like this hotel. Its the exact opposite. Its like living in the isolated hills and needing a car to get to everything outside of this resort. 

That being said once you get here you don't ever have to leave. I'm sure the gift shop could fill in as a convenience store and restaurants, bars, and everything else is here.

The huge buffet, the incredible pool - complete with sandy beach, the rooftop club way up high with Strip views... its all here. 

Rooms are also a big, big plus. They are large. They are considered suites but according to Webster's dictionary they don't really fit the textbook definition of a  suite. They are just one big room instead of two rooms as in a proper suite. I've had proper suites - the great part is if your with a few friends the one grumpus can go to sleep early, shut the bedroom door and the rest can keep the lights on in the living room. Can't do that here in the standard suits.

I like the value aspect of this property. But when your on the other side of the highway it gets you better views but you also feel like your missing out.

I might go to other establishments for anything I mentioned above but it's nice if I don't have to.
   All the rooms at the Rio are considered suites.  They are large but pretty much an over sized room with a large couch and coffee table.  They say all the rooms are the same but I didn't have a refrigerator in my room every time. 
   I love the buffets here but the last several times I stayed here the Seafood Buffet was closed for remodeling.   It has reopened though and was well worth the money.  I believe it's at 38 bucks now
but well worth it.  The Carnival Buffet is great too.  This buffet is divided into sections of the different ethnicity's and types of food.   You'll have Chinese, Italian, Mexican, Japanese (sushi included,) pizzas, salads, etc.   
  Keep in mind if you gamble at the Harrah's Properties which include the Rio, Caesars, Harrah's, Paris, Bally's, the Flamingo and the Imperial Palace and you happen to be Platinum Status or higher, you will be able to go into a separate line...sometimes immediate seating when the normal line is an hour or longer.   This should be true for all the buffets at the above mentioned properties.
  Normally, I wouldn't mention the swimming pool but here at the Rio, don't expect to relax and kick back.  It's quite loud with music blasting and people dancing and drinking all over the pool area.  If you're up for drinking and partying it's great but there's no laying out to relax here.
   Here's one of the few places I stay in Las Vegas and I don't go dancing here.  I don't care too much for the Voo Doo Lounge.  If you're going out to meet people, the Voo Doo Lounge isn't very big.   If you're just going out to drink and have fun with friends then it's great and has a nice view of the strip.
   If you're staying at the Rio and planning on going to the Voo Doo Lounge on a Friday night you can go to the concierge desk and ask for passes.  If they have them they'll give the to you for free.

Right from the start we were disappointed. Unless you want to valet your car, you have to park in the parking garage on the other side of the hotel.  So checking in was a slight nightmare. 
 

Our room was very dated. No complimentary coffee in room (bring your own k cups). We were told the k cups in the minibar are about $18.

They have cut back on maintenance like a bunch of other Vegas properties and it really shows -- the paint on the outside of the properly is visibly peeling in places., among other things.

The Show in the Sky used to be a fun thing to ride on.  They would give you a huge stack of beads to keep and another stack to throw out to the crowd.  In addition, they gave you a special medallion that only people who had ridden it could get.  Now, they give you three token beads and that's it.  You don't get any to throw out anymore and the special one is gone.  Staff say the management cut back to save a few pennies per ride (Keep in mind that you typically pay to ride the thing).  

Speaking of the Show in the Sky, their revamp last year sucks.  They went to a  stupid ""more adult"" theme that doesn't fit the theme of the show or the property.  They should have sticked to the Samba type theme, hello, ""Rio"" ?!.    Also, they have cut it back to only running a few nights a week and when it does run it's a very short show now, only ~10 minutes.   Sigh.

The iBar had some Microsoft Surface tables in it that sort of made that bar stand out, but now most of them reboot when you are using them.  They also used to allow you to order your drink at the table, which I thought was way cool, but that option is gone now.  Also, you used to be able to chat with other tables nearby but that is also gone.

Voodoo up on the roof is still pretty cool, though the clientele is kind of interesting now that they're giving away so many free passes to get up there.

I don't mean to sound too negative about the place -- it's still pretty decent.  It's just not what it used to be and people coming now probably have no idea how much they have cut back on the fun.

It's 6am and I can't sleep. The time difference has not been my friend. I get up, and decide i'll waste some time at the gym. As I exit the elevator that connects the hotel rooms with the actual casino floor I am suddenly met by a big black sheet that spans the entire width of hall way. Along with the ominous sheet is: a handful of casino security, 3 or 4 metro police officers, and very tired looking casino managers. Everyone immediately points to an ""employee's only"" door to my left and directs me through. I walk down winding hallways, at each checkpoint another police officer pointing out the proper directions. Eventually I get out to the casino floor, and I notice another black sheet. Apparently I had just taken a detour via staff-only hallways in order to avoid a small portion of the main hallway that leads to the elevators.

So I decide that it is best to not hang around and I start to head to the gym, only to be met by police tape. Now I was a little more curious. I ask the guard what happened, and she immediately cut me off and insisted she ""could not talk about it at this time."" So, me being the savvy millennial I am, I pull out my phone and google the Rio. Turns out undercover security shot an alleged ""repeat offender"" who was attempting to the rob the casino. A man was killed my first night in Vegas.... Definitely a story to tell.

At first Rio really did not handle this well. They didn't accommodate the people trapped out of their rooms (once you left your room and came downstairs, police wouldn't let you back up. ""Security measure""....I was locked out for about 5 hours.)

my boyfriend and I weren't too angry about being locked out of our room because we were sure the hotel would be accommodating their customers and giving them things to do as they waited to back into their room. This just seemed like pretty basic crisis communications. When we went to talk to the manager though, this was not the case.

The hotel managers and staff wouldn't actually listen when we spoke to them. They just kept droning over and over, ""we cant let you up into your room, once metro is involved we have no control."" This wasn't what we were asking though. We didn't NEED to get to our room, we just wanted something to do while we waited. We weren't the only ones either. People started getting really heated when they found out the hotel wasn't offering any kind of distraction. Eventually though, with quite a bit of complaining the hotel finally started giving people champagne brunch vouchers and waiving hotel fees.

It was too late though for me. Having graduated with a marketing degree, I know this first thing about marketing is to keep the customers happy. Angry customers can only lead to trouble. By the time the hotel finally connected the dots too many people were mad. 

Overall this is a very long way of saying Rio needs to remember that at the end of the day, if the customer isn't happy: you aren't doing your job.",20,4,1

The unrenovated rooms look a little worked over but for the price, you can't beat it.  It is a suite and comes with a couch, fridge, seperate bathroom and changing area.  

I didn't like that the hallways look like they haven't been taken care of in a year, or so.  Someone dropped a drink in the hallway, we were walking down the hall the next evening and it was still laying there.  Even worse, two days later when we were leaving, it was still there.  

I love that they have a free shuttle from their hotel to Bally's\/Paris and Harrah's and back.  This shuttle even runs until 1am.  Bonus.

I recommend signing up for the Harrah's Reward Card.  You don't have to get a bungy chord for it but you do get great perks if you gamble.  My friends and I just had a comp'd night.  Holler.

I do like a couple of their bars as well.  I recommend McFaddens for a few reasons.  1.  They might be the only bar in Vegas that serves Smithwicks.  2.  Their bar food is actually really good.  3.  Beer pong.  My friends and I also enjoyed the VooDoo Lounge and iBar.

I do recommend swinging into Burger King for drunk dinner.  You can substitute a beer for soda.

And this visit was a miss. Stopping by for one night while driving through, it started off bad:

The hour+ long wait to check in and the attitude received at the desk as a result was unacceptable. 

Then came the room. Ugh. Does maintenance not check anything? Or is it a result of the room cleaning not reporting anything, or even worse, management not giving a damn all together? 

The undersides of the small bench seats were slashed open, the mini Kcup maker had no Kcups. That's useful. The door pin in the bathroom was about to fall out. The trash bags were missing. Lamp on the table, broken. And the view from the room was a wonderful view of the low roof.

Update:

So trying to check in. 3 so called employees at the counter ""working"". The express check in machines are pointless. They tell you to go stand in line. Why?  Why do I keep giving the rio a chance. I guess I'm stupid for thinking that management cares at all.   More to come-

Do you want to go to the pool and relax in the later afternoon? Do you want to cool down at 7pm, when the sun is no longer burning you to death? Well you're SOL. They close the pool at 7pm. In August. When it's 100 outside. Yeah... that makes perfect sense.",2,0,0

The Good:

Our front desk person seemed nice.  We got tons of free mardi gras beads.  

The Bad:

To me the Rio is the Lindsay Lohan of Vegas hotels:  once a hot and promising place for fun; now it just looks sad and weathered.  

Rio Advertises itself as an ""all suite"" hotel with large rooms, but merely providing more of the same putrid carpet space to stare at while you wait for maintenance to come fix the hot water does not a ""suite"" make.

My ""suite"" experience at the Rio officially started with me walking into the room and noticing the television bolted down and tilted in a fashion not viewable from the beds.  Not even a flat screen (let alone flat panel) television, this thing looked like a throwback to something from the 90's.  Here's a tip guys:  if my single, elderly, mother has a more state-of-the-art television in her living room than you have in your ""suites,"" maybe it's time to upgrade.  Fortunately I was able to muster the strength to tilt this massive dinosaur to face the beds.  

In addition to the television, I also noticed these ""suites"" didn't have many of the conveniences I have come to enjoy in suites from other hotels.  For example, often times hotel rooms (suites and non-suites) will have some type of semi-adequate sound system, or even an ipod docking station.  The closest thing our Rio ""suite"" had was one of those old fake-wood-paneling alarm clocks.  We didn't have much luck plugging our ipod into that.  The ""suite"" did have one of those newer coffee machines, however.  Unfortunately, we couldn't locate the coffee.   Were we supposed to purchase it from the mini bar?

Then there was the plumbing.  Oh the plumbing...  The only thing more enjoyable than amassing a thick layer of ""Vegas"" across your skin after a long day of heavy gambling, drinking, and cruising, is not having hot water in your shower to wash it off.  At best, the water in our ""suite"" shower reached lukewarm.  I called maintenance and the front desk requesting assistance.  They said they would send someone up.  We never saw anyone come up, and the problem continued.  Furthermore, the bathtub backed up while we took showers, so we had the benefit of not only being showered with cold water, but also soaking in cold water as well.  Lucky us.  

As if that weren't enough, our toilet in the ""suite"" hardly had any water going into the bowl.  This is great news for those of you out there planning a nice romantic weekend at the Rio; nothing gets you in the mood like going to the bathroom and seeing the fat dump your girlfriend left in there an hour ago.  

The Ugly

When we called and asked to speak to the manager, she made it seem like it was our fault for not calling.  When I told her that we called and spoke with maintenance, she made it seem like it was our fault for not calling the front desk.  When I said that we did call the front desk, she made it seem like it was our fault for not calling the front desk a second time.  Seriously?  

In summation, my experience at the Rio reminded me of that old Duran Duran song, ""her name is Rio and she SUCKS!...""


*Additional final thoughts:  the Rio is located off the strip, so you'll either have to fight the crowds and wait a substantial amount of time for the tram to the strip, drive yourself, cab it, or walk a considerable distance.  Either way it makes for an expensive and\/or unfulfilling trip.  If you manage to fight the hoards and snag a seat in the shuttle, plan on a short night out, as the shuttle stops running relatively early.  Often times we felt stranded there because we didn't want to drink and drive and we couldn't get a shuttle.  Perhaps they count on people feeling trapped there, which is why they make their food so overpriced.

Also...the clientele there seemed a little sketchy...my friend (a 49-year-old Filipino man) was openly verbally assaulted by a seemingly drunk woman on the first night we got there, merely because his wife sat down and played in an empty seat she had long-since left.  Security never came to stop her.  It was a little scary, and a lot ghetto...",1,1,0

Yes if you pay a lot more money at another casino you'll receive a bigger, fancier room but that's obvious. I only payed about 60 dollars a night and the Rio always has great deals if you check online. The casino has a whole party atmosphere to it and there are always really good looking girls everywhere. The reason is that they hire very good looking workers plus there are two clubs there plus you have so many girl tourists walking around. So if you want a casino with lots of eye candy this is the place. I gambled at the bar and they were constantly giving me free drinks. They also have a show where some boat thing goes around the casinos and everyone's goes nuts when it happens. Its quite entertaining. In addition I  was happy with my room.

I got the rooms pretty cheap too for $270 for the weekend. Day of check out is usually at 11am, but if you want to check out late, they will only extend it an extra hour. 

I strongly suggest you valet on the day of check in. We actually self parked and we ended up at the far end of the casino. Now imagine carrying your luggage all the way to the front for check in. Just valet and pay $1.

No need to write about there being slot machines, blackjack tables, sportsbook, etc since this is just like any other casino. However, some of the other casinos are much more better looking but who is really here to look at casinos.

I purchased a TravelZoo Deal so two nights between 5 girls came to under $50 per person.  Awesome!  I was worried because none of us had stayed here before and I didn't know how clean\/nice the rooms would be or if they really were suite size or smaller.  With 5 girls we need all the space we can get for little money.  We were all pleasantly surprised at the size and cleanliness of the room.  We had two queen beds and a sofa - perfect sleeping arrangements.  There was plenty of floor space for luggage without feeling like we were on top of each other.  The bathroom had the toilet, shower, and sink plus a separate area outside with another sink, huge mirror, mirrored closet, and a fridge.  This was the perfect size room for all of us.  We liked that the hotel was off the strip because the casino wasn't packed with people wander through.  We spent Saturday at the Topless Pool (which was not as scary as I thought) and bought one of the lounge couches, with umbrella for my pasty skin, at only a $100 total minimum tab which we exceeded with one round of drinks.  The drinks came in plastic take-home tumblers with straws which we used for drinks the rest of the weekend (and have been deemed our drinking cups).  Our server at the pool was super friendly and awesome,  she even remembered my drink when I ordered a second one which is impressive considering the amount of people she was dealing with out there.  At night we went to Buzio's for dinner, which was very good and then headed up to the Voodoo Lounge for drinks and dancing.  The view up there is awesome and the music was a good mix of old school and current hip-hop.  

Overall, we had a great stay and would definitely consider going again.  Yes, the hotel is a bit out-dated but is still clean, nice, and spacious.",1,0,1

Overall, the hotel is very smoky and our room was not ready at midnight - when check in begins at 4 p.m. They've recently added check in kiosks to expedite things.

I don't really enjoy leaving bad reviews, so I'll keep it short with why I would never stay again:

The shower pressure was HORRIBLE! I'm not sure what the plan was here but the water barely came out and what did come out, just came out all half-assed and made it pretty difficult to shower comfortably without having to be directly under the shower head for water. I uploaded a photo so you can kind of see what I'm talking about. 

Like another reviewer mentioned, the WiFi here was also horrible! Dial-up like speeds is an understatement. Why charge for it, if you can't even access it? I ended up having to be connected to their IT people for about 20 minutes before thy finally ended up resetting their port connection to finally get it to work the day before we left. 

Checking out was a nightmare trying to use my Total Rewards balance to pay for my resort fees. I continuously showed the reception lady emails showing I had a balance and she couldn't help me unless I went to go sort it out at the TR desk.

Yes, the rooms are a bit bigger compared to rooms on the strip, but they definitely look a bit outdated. The only other thing we did like was the free shuttle over to Harrah's or Bally's every 30 minutes if you want to go walk\/drink without having to drive. 

Other than that, it's definitely worth more money to just stay on the strip...",4,0,0

I stayed off-strip at the Rio because the convention I was attending was being held there and it was just more convenient.  They do have a free shuttle that goes to the strip and and I found the drivers to be efficient and polite.

Housekeeping was also excellent.  The room was cleaned in a timely fashion every day and when we asked for extra towels, we got them for the rest of our stay without question or complaint.

The casino is also fine.  I didn't play any table games but the slots and video poker are what you would expect.

But, we had major and minor issues with our room and while the staff was polite and handled everything we had problems we shouldn't have had.

1. The TV\/stand was not secured properly to the wall and when I pulled it out, the whole thing tipped over.  Luckily, we were able to push it back upright before disaster, but one of us could have been hurt.

2. The A\/C only worked if you turned it down to 55.  The coldest our room ever got was 74.  There was also a constant dripping noise coming from inside the wall, presumably from the A\/C.

3. The hairdryer was horribly and obviously broken.

4. The toilet paper holder came right out of the wall.

While a few of those things are minor, it just proves that the Rio isn't ready to compete with the big boys.  We shouldn't have had to deal with our TV falling over or our A\/C not working properly.  You just don't see the level of service or the quality as other Vegas hotels.",2,0,0

The rooms are way overpriced, considering you are off the strip.  And some of the rooms haven't been remodeled in a while, like when they only had the one tower.

In many other cities the Rio's convention and meeting room facilities would be considered downright opulent and something a city would be proud to have for hosting events. In Vegas, it's like yawn, been there, done that, it's a little dated and not all that. 

Service: Hustle was the word of the day for our visit from the manager we directly worked with. Got service with a smile too. When a technical difficulty came up their IT staff was on the ball with a quick response. I always love that and give it mad praise when you get that kind of service. 

Food: The food was average. Pretty to look at, slow to get on the table, servers didn't pay attention and were sloppy in getting food on and off the tables and it is insulting to tea to lump their so called offering into the category of tea. Bleech. 

But that's where the positive comments come to a halt. Seriously if you're paying premium money to rent a room for an event and they roll out a cheap projector that is broken to the point they put a 9 volt battery under one corner of it so it would project a level image onto the screen? Seriously? Of all the comps I've ever received in Vegas, a 9 volt battery to fix junk equipment is the worst on the list. (See the picture, you can't make this stuff up.)

If you forget a clicker for your Powerpoint, it's a cool $125 a day rental for something I could have bought for half price had I had the time to grab a cab and run to Fry's to buy one (including the cab fare and cabbie tip). I ended up making changes so it wasn't needed but the price they quoted takes ""FLEECING"" to a whole other level. 

When I compare the Gold Coast to the Rio in terms of price vs. square footage, quality of the space, quality of the A\/V equipment, and yes even the staff, the Gold Coast quite frankly kicks the Rio's ass HARD. Anyone renting space for a meeting and considering the Rio needs to think long and hard about it as most likely they are not receiving the best value for their money. 

2 Stars, and even the second star is one I'm on the fence about giving. But a placement on my Jackassery list is a must. As yes, I think sticking a braying jackass in place of the Rio's management team would do a better job of handling this place. (Again our one on site rep who I can't name was awesome considering she was working with crappy equipment).

At first when I checked in (room 1617), the front desk person (Brian) was really nice and gave me some free VIP passes to the Voodoo lounge and etc. He put us in a suite that overlooked the swimming pool. We got to our room noticed it was pretty nice for the price we paid 325 for three nights is pretty cheap. 

The location is a bit off the strip which kind of sucked but the shuttle was sorta helpful but sucked if you were the group that couldnt make it on the shuttle and had to wait another 15-30mins. The pool is pretty murky which was kind of gross! We only went one day after our first visit. They seriously need to clean up the pool hahaha! Some of the food there is pretty good too like the chinese places Mah Jong.

Now here was the problem. Called in earlier in the evening about our bathroom having this foul sewer smell. Waited about an hour and a half, no one came. Called back then finally a facility worker came. By the time he came the smell sorta went away, so he said it was no problem. We left for the strip, came back after 4 hours and the foul smell was there again. We finally realized that when people around our room was using their water it made our room sooooo bad! Anyways called again late at night and a guy came into our room around 3am. We were already told that we would get a new room. Oh I also forgot to mention the dead bolt on our door would not shut unless you wiggled the handle from the inside so when you left your room the door would not close. So the facility worker tried to fix the door which didnt help at all since he opened it and cleared out all our keys, tried to put some kind of cleaning solution down our drains which only masked the smell. At this time my gf was annoyed that there was this guy in our room at like 4am still trying to fix this when she just wanted him to leave. Instead security was called cause he thought she was being rowdy. The front desk manager was not apologetic at all to her, was pretty damn rude. They never called us in the morning to switch rooms, I actually had to call and tell them to move us. Never really got a sorry from them. I think we should of got comped a night for all that drama. We were moved to room 1477 which had no problems but no view, but we really didnt care anymore.

I read some of these reviews with amusement that folks want diamond service and don't even gamble. HELLO......it's Las Vegas they want gamblers! If you want a 5 star hotel go to Palm Springs or Hawaii......Vegas caters to gamblers folks!
I never wait to check in, get my car from valet.....or to eat in any place inside the Rio or any other Caesars hotel in Las Vegas. I also have a casino host to make my arrangements. Yes it's a perk....but I earn it by gambling on my trips here.

Overall not bad if you wanna get away from the crowds on the strip.",6,5,3

FIRST IS THE WORST:  The first night, the four of us got put into a suite with one King Size bed and a sofa bed.  I believe this room was intended for someone on a quick business trip because A) the view sucked B) there were only 2 sets of towels, C) the sofa bed had no sheets, D) there were no trash cans AT ALL.  I was tempted to just crumple a bunch of toilet paper and pile them up next to the toilet floor in my disgust.  E) we could hear everything next door... EVERYTHING........it was an annoying couple with their crying baby.  I was tempted to do battle with them.  How dare you wake up at 7am in Vegas.

REDEMPTION:  After ranting to the front desk (but not too much since the rooms were comped), the rest of the stay, we got put into a sweet suite with two queen size beds.  Perfect except for a few stains... don't worry, they were merely some small gum stains on the carpet.  The room had a gorgeous view of the adjacent tower, part of the strip and the pool below.  Also, it was decked out with very clean and contemporary dcor.

PLAY TIME:  I can't comment on the gaming at Rio because most of my time playing was at the adjacent walk-able Gold Coast and Palms (whoever says it's not walkable is weaksauce), since they have better Video Poker and Craps, my two favorite games.  I personally loved the location because it is away from the craziness of the strip, but at the same time, they provide shuttles that head to Paris, Bally's, and Harrah's.  Compared to my previous stay at Paris, I'd rather stay at the more spacious Rio.  Show me a more spacious hotel and I'll check it out.  The pool area wasn't too shabby, with a nice little fake beach area.",1,0,0

We went to the spa and had massages that were just OK, but the spa is nice, they have a good selection of juice, clean hot tub and steam room.  Took advantage of the spa area twice while we were there since it's included with the resort fee.  The spa attendent Collyn was super sweet and attentive and even gave me a little bag with some samples in it for my birthday along with a birthday balloon!

All American Bar & Grill was pretty good in the middle of the night when we got back from gambling.  Went to Hash Hash a Go Go twice for breakfast, this was pretty good.  Voodoo Steak was delish.

When he came back he told me they are upgrading me to a suite. Although I thought they were all suites I didn't pay it any mind. I had to put down a down payment of some sort but I didn't mind.

Fortunately, I got to the room and saw that the hotel owners must have figured that out and entered into the new millennium with renovations.  The room were huge and really neat and modern - the perfect place for a group of girls who will have their belongings spread out everywhere.... so we thought.

We went to the pool, where the time machine sent us right back to 1991.... Wait... Rewind further... 1989... Quick! Get me my pink Walkman!... Oh, nevermind, I don't need it, there's plenty of 80s music blaring from the less than clear sound system. 

Strangely, they painted parts of the bottom of the pool yellow and orange. I later learned that it is made to look like a clown fish from up above.  Interesting choice.  I get it.  I guess.  It just made the pool look dirty, if you'd ask me.    

So, being a couple of mighty fine females, we got comped back into this century at the special adult only pool - Sapphire.  The pool was legitimately nice, and it had better, newer seating, waterfalls, hot tubs.  If you can get over interesting tattoos and toplessness, it certainly was a better environment than the other pool.  

After a good night of sleep, I got up to treat myself with a massage, which was the best part of my trip so far for sure.  When I was done, I felt so relaxed and went out into the sun. 

For some reason my calves were itchy.  Hmmmmm.... must be sunburn... hmmm... they continued to itch all day and through my redeye flight... hmmmmm..  

When I arrived back home I got a text from my friend, whose mother slept in the same bed I did that night after I did. They had changed the sheets, but she woke up with itchy welts all over her. The hotel switched their room, but didn't do much else.

We stayed here during a golf trip during Mid-October, 2016.  We had our comp choice of any of the many Ceaser's properties and boy did we make a mistake with this one.  We chose it because of its easy location to get in and out to the courses and because of its decent pool facility.  Get this... the pools were mostly closed in 90 degree weather without warning of any kind on their web site or during the reservation process.  What a joke!  They had one small pool partially open that was so filthy that people made footprints on the bottom when they walked, not to mention the multiple ""floaties"" everywhere in the water.  Can you say YUCK!  People were lined up to use the one shower just to get cooled off as most were smart enough to stay away from the tiny toxic pool area that was open.  Of course, the drinks areas were close, despite being a 90 degree sunny weekend.  Pathetic...

This place is simply a cattle coral with promotion victims literally crawling everywhere.  At one point, we stopped and counted over 100 people in the reservation line!  The room was FILTHY with multiple, highly visible stains on the couch.  Again, YUCK!  How could any self-respecting maid let that go without calling for a cleaning of the furniture?  Also, these are not suites as indicated in the marketing.  They are simply large rooms with a couch thrown in, (albeit filthy).  The casino is a joke and be prepared to hold your breath.  They don't offer the newest games and the tables were all full.  Food choices are multiple and the one bright spot was the room service food.  They package it as a ""take out"" offering to make it easier to deliver which makes it feel entirely low end but the food was actually very good.  I think the best offering was their pizza, believe it or not.  The Voodoo Steak House was an attractive choice for dinner but be prepared to hose down your wallet.  My wife and I had a $50 bottle of wine, one $20 crab cake that was nothing more than a hush puppy, and two a la carte dinners.  The bill was over $300!  They try to make this place feel exclusive but its just another overpriced Vegas fake.  How can a restaurant with these prices have bathroom walls that are disintegrating, stained urinals, and amenities that don't even work?  Interestingly, they share the ""exclusive"" elevator between the restaurant and the thrill ride zip line which makes the attempt at being ""exclusive"" a pathetic fail.

I went to Vegas for the first time and stayed at Rio because my boyfriends has comps from atlantic city. With that being said it was my first time i was really excited about this trip. I knew that the hotel is off the strip and taking taxis everywhere was not too big of a problem for us. 

As soon as we got to the hotel. I noticed the place is very old( kinda dirty looking). But I wasn't too worry about it because from the pictures of the room when we booked it, the rooms look very clean and nice.

When we got to our room we were speechless!!!! I thought i was in a cheap motel out in the middle of nowhere!! We took our shoes off walking around the room in our socks. My white socks were black within the seconds. It made me feel so uncomfortable and that was just the floor..

 As i walk thru the room and look at the couch and the footrest by the bed, there were stains on them (like someone spilled a drink and didn't clean up) We laid on the bed to rest a little and the sheets were so dry and hard feels like sand paper. It was a non-smoking room but the sheet cover ON the BED has cigarette burn holes on it!! 

When we booked the room, It saids we will have a flat screen. Not only it was an 1970's old style TV. The remote doesn't even work. That didn't really matter to us because we know that we won't be watching too much TV. But still, it was the quality of everything in that room that really made us angry. 

We tried to put some of our things in a safe later and that doesn't work. We called the front desk and they sent someone up to fixed it. The shower fan was broken so in the middle of my shower, it felt like I couldn't breath!!

After all those problems of the room, we were very unhappy. So my boyfriend went to the front desk and complain. After hearing all of our problems of the room she went like,"" I can't put you into another room because we are all booked and we can have someone clean your room better the NEXT TIME"". So there was nothing we can do but deal with the dirty room situation.

On the day of our check out. We tried to check out on our TV but of course that didn't  work because NOTHING works in that room. We went down to the front deck  and there was a long line of people waiting to check out only one person behind the desk was helping all the people that were trying to check out. There were probably 10 or 12 people behind the front desk not doing anything. 

My boyfriend went up to one of the girls that isn't doing anything and ask her if we have to go wait in line to check out if we didn't put in any cash deposit. She was like,"" No. You can drop off your keys and just go and deposit on your card will go back in a week or so"" My boyfriend asked,"" What if there's charges on there that not right or not supposed to be on the bill that I want to make sure?"" Girl behind the desk:"" Well, if you want to make sure then you have to wait in line ( with attitude and a mean face)!!

When brought there attention it was o well. So rude! Bryant and Victor could use a class in customer service when I finally get up there to talk to them in regards to my room and get the key left for me he COMPLETELY ignored the question I had twice a tried to hurry me away. The key that he gave me didn't work after walking all the way across the hotel. Then the ROOM we were given this super luxurious 1 bedroom suite. Looks like it has never been upgraded since they built the hotel needless to say we are checking out and going to another hotel and disputing the charge here if they don't give me my one night back.  #DON'T STAY HERE,5,7,0

It's just off the strip so you can get in and out easily and jump right onto the 15. We've stayed here twice this year, for 5 nights in Feb., and for 8 nights in July.  Here's why: 
I would give the Rio 5 stars if the restaurants weren't so overpriced. We made the the mistake of eating there twice in the first trip but never again. This last trip we brought a $6.00 throwaway toaster from Walmart, paper plates and a cutting knife, stopped at a nearby Trader Joe's and stocked up on staples for breakfast, fruit, snacks and sweets. 
I bought 5 different restaurant Groupons in advance of the trip so we got to try some great new and different restaurants for even more savings (which I reviewed here on Yelp)! And I also found restaurants west of the Rio on Yelp before this last trip to try. 
The rooms are huge, with a living room-type area, and good sized mini-fridge and comfortable. The only problem we had was we could hear our noisy neighbors through the door between rooms. We put extra towels down and that helped alot.
We only use valet parking when we stay here because it's just too far to walk to self parking when you want to mazimize your vacation time. 
The boyfriend and I both have Total Rewards cards and for 8 nights we paid $150.08 including tax, 4 nights were comped. We gamble just long enough but low stakes to make sure I can comped for our next trip.  
I highly recommend the Rio as a great home base but we go elsewhere to eat, gamble and sightsee.",4,0,0

They have a shuttle that comes every half hour that takes you to Paris\/Bally's. Personally, I can't recommend this place.

We got the deluxe suite. The first room we went to had a strong and odd smell of bad perfume and hamburgers, and even looked dirty and old. I don't know how that mix came about, but it did and I was not having it. We requested to change our room and ended up getting the run-around. Literally, a run around. We had to hop onto the other elevator since our second room was on the other half of the hotel. The guest services guy told us that our keys were automatically changed to work; they didn't. We ended up going back to the front desk to get those reprogrammed and headed back up to our room. The process took about twenty minutes, which wasn't much of our time but definitely added to the inconvenience and discomfort of our trip.

The room we ended up staying in didn't look much better than the first but at least it didn't wreak of awkward smells, so I'll consider that an upgrade. The beds were definitely springy enough to support a jack-in-the-box for the rest of its existence and the bed pillows were actually square pillows. There was a tube TV, a yellowing-colored ""safe"" and a bathtub that had a window to the bedroom. What architect would come up with a brilliant idea like that? No idea. But of course, he\/she thought that taking a dump in the restroom did not require much privacy.

I can't say that my stay here was stellar, but life goes on. The best part of the experience was knowing that I would not come back again. It's not a bad place if you get the right hotel room for your requested price, but don't expect anything too fabulous like what the pictures offer.",0,0,0

It seems to be smokier than most of the other hotels.

There's also the confusing advertising surrounding their seafood buffet.  Posters everywhere, even within the hotel, say it is ""all seafood, all the time,"" but it really is not open all the time.  It has quite limited hours, actually.

It also has the most pricey Starbucks locations of any I have visited in Las Vegas.  I know the prices are inflated, but when kids' drinks are more than double what they are at my local Starbucks, I call foul!  

I've never won at Rio, but I haven't played a lot.  So, I can't really say how good it is to play at Rio.

The room itself was very nice and perfect for the price we paid. The bed was pretty comfortable and I love that the room had a ton of windows. There was a small fringe, a TV that pulled out of a cabinet, and a couch. The bathroom was average but there were full length mirrors on the closet doors which was awesome. 

Now here comes the one and only problem I had with this place. The water pressure in the shower was horrible! I have ALOT of hair and it took me so long to rinse shampoo out. I don't know if it was the shower head or the pressure through out the hotel, but it was really bad. 

The hotel had 4-5 pools, one of them being 21+. We didn't spend any time in the pools but there where always a bunch of people down there and if you have kids with you then that is a perfect place to spend the day.

Now it's time for a change of scenery, even though I'm treated there like a VIP and receive high floors with strip views for free and have my own line for buffets and check ins. 

Speaking of checking in, the Rio needs to organize their Hotel Registration area and create a separate line for Diamond, Platinum and Seven Stars vs the regular Joe's (Gold Tier), the person in front of me flipped out because the person assisting the registration area let 2 people from the VIP line check in before us. Talk about lack of organization! 

This hotel may not be up to date with some of the other Harrah's hotels (Caesar's Palace, Paris, and Planet Hollywood) but it gets the job done, plus all the rooms are suites. So more room for, ME! My suite included: 2 Queen Beds (No Bedbugs), Wifi, Sitting area for guests,  A huge bath with a separate shower and toilet with a second separate shower and toilet, I thought was pretty odd. Also a refrigerator for drinks and snacks and a Keurig Coffee maker. 

Although the suite was not up to date, along with the whole resort, it was incredibly clean and did it's job. Hurray for the Rio!

Check in was long (about 20 minutes even with most or all stations open, but they did offer bottled water to drink while we were waiting.

All product for the in-room Keurig was missing, but housekeeping was good enough to bring it by when we asked.  But that's OK, you're in Vegas right, I mean how much time are you going to be spending in your room?

I ended up packing all my exercise stuff for naught since there is not a complimentary workout room and the $28 per day fee for use of the spa\/gym is a bit much for an hour workout.

The conference center is a fair distance form the gaming floor and the Ipanema Tower, but that eliminates the temptation to sneak out of a few sessions and try your luck I guess.  No issues at all with conference space or catering and technical support.

A good variety of restaurants on site: Hash House a Go-Go (5 stars), Martorano's (5 stars) and the Carnival Buffet (3 stars) is addition to Dim Sum, Sports Book Deli, Indian and an American Burger Bar.  Enough variety for a 3-4 day trip for sure.

Be sure to join the Total Rewards Club while here; even if you aren't much of a gambler; it's good for a buck off most meals and hey, a buck is a buck!

Gaming floor never really seemed to be that active while I was here, and I don't play much besides slots, so you will need to look to another review for that information.

No concerns with Security, Housekeeping was excellent for the duration of the stay (Don't forget to tip!) and checkout was a breeze as well (which it should be at 4:30am).

Overall, it just lacked a sense of vibrancy and excitement that I usually associate with Las Vegas.  It was, as the ratings suggest, A-OK.

Okay, I'm spoiled, but this is Vegas. At night, the constant dripping of the toilet became annoying, even after shutting the door totally, drip, drip, drip. Oh yes, I enjoying being woken up by neighbors in the next room who were talking, not yelling. Paper thin, ugh.

Let me say this about the Rio, if you're interested in finding a hooker while you're in Vegas, worry no more. They're here and not so good looking either. My God, how many toothless woman asked me 'Where is your wife?"" Obviously, security looks the other way. Actually, where was the security at this hotel? In all my years ( and I go back plenty) of staying in Vegas, I don't think I remember seeing a hotel without visible security in uniform until the Rio. Not a big worry in most casino's but damn, this crowd was scary. I mean ""on probation"" scary and your wallet is looking tempting to them.

Then of course, that wonderfully dated Masquerade in the Sky show. Good gosh, put that clunker to bed. Alright, there was eye candy for all but still, do they have to sing?? Any let's not forget the surprise performers who pop on random pedestal's sing karaoke for about three minutes and screw. Do they really think people enjoy this crap?

Oh yes, before I forget, how does the Rio not have a 24 coffee shop?? It's the staple of any Vegas hotel. I mean if I want breakfast when I get up at 1pm and am told there isn't any place here that serves breakfast anymore after 11am. WHAT??  I ended up having a burger at the All-American Grill which was good, but I wanted my eggs and greasy meats, dammit!

Alright, so Iater I went to the gym\/spa to workout and then get rid of the smoke out of my lungs in the steam and sauna. I must say, they had an adequate workout area, you know you make do with what they offer. The spa facilities had the obligatory steam, sauna and whirlpool area and to my surprise I enjoyed them all. What I didn't enjoy was the ""attendant' who never left my side, upon my finishing my workout said ""are you leaving?"", no I'm just done working out. Later after showering after a hot steam, ""are you leaving?"" NO! Go find something to do, fold some towels or something. He was young and thinking he was doing a good job so I left him a tip regardless but someone should take him to another spa in town and let him observe and learn.

Beside not having my room cleaned on my first night, the Rio has the tightest machines in town, the most relentless hookers, the awful free singing , and the dirtiest casino I've ever seen. Hello, could someone wipe these machines down once a day and maybe empty the overflowing ashtrays if that isn't a problem??

In case your wondering, I won't be staying there again and vow never to set foot in that place again. HARRAH'S wake up and get this place in order!  You can do better, much better elsewhere.",1,0,0

Staff was friendly, room service and housekeeping were really quick to deliver, and the few places to eat downstairs were actually pretty good. 

Minus a star for the pool area. The entire area is totally shaded by the hotel itself until late afternoon... when it starts to get chilly. Whats the point of that?

The hotel offers free self parking which is a huge plus! It's got a really cool carnivale vibe to it. The staff is courteous and kind. Service is great. Although did feel for the women as they were pretty much in their underwear and is freezing in there!

They don't do early check-in. We got there an hour before and ended up killing time at a cafe. 

The rooms are also bigger than I had imagined. There was a sink in the bathroom and a separate area that had additional sinks.  This was great. We also had a really nice view as well. There was a small fridge that came in handy with the leftovers we had. A microwave would've been nice to have, but it wasn't a deal breaker.

The hotel itself was dated, dark and dingy and everywhere you went there were people trying to sell you something.

Our room was the farthest room from the elevator (we are disabled and requested a closer room). The bed was EXTREMELY uncomfortable, the lampshades were cracked, fridge broken, bathtub dirty and the room was dated and dusty.  I received none of the preferences that I requested on my reservation and was told that a room upgrade WAS AVAILABLE, however, I had to pay extra per night for it.  They didn't seem to care that I was on my Honeymoon and also a diamond member.

After 2 nights I was finally able to speak with a host!  He moved us, to another room and told me that it had a Jacuzzi tub.  Our bed in this second room was more comfortable, however, there was no Jacuzzi tub!!!!!!! 

We also were not able to see Penn and Teller because the show was sold out. We were told that our Joliet host should have reserved the show tickets on our reservation.  My Joliet host told me to go to Total Rewards when we got to Vegas and request the show tickets.

They put a very long hold on $200 (other places simply do an authorization) and the place was filthy. Worst stay ever. 

After getting to my room I noticed the bed looked like someone was just in it, I didn't have towels, they left me only 1 bottle of shampoo and soap and the sink was already clogged up!! Keep in mind, I had the business class room! I called housekeeping and they fixed everything rather quickly but I don't want to deal with that. 

Random stuff on the floor in the hallway, a bad smell.... just trashy. I wish I didn't stay here and to be perfectly honest, I tried to stay out of my room. Honestly I wasn't happy at all.

I have stayed at The Rio 4 times while in Vegas. There are very cute waitresses and fun bartenders everythere throughout the property. The checkin has always run smoothly. The casino seems to always have something going on . Singers, Chippendale strippers signing autographs, etc. etc. From The the Show in the Sky to the Sexy Voodoo Beach, this place is fun! The I-Bar located right at front doors has awesome martini's and beautiful women in thongs serving them up to you! It can be hit or miss with the crowd. For dining options we have tried several. First the famous Village Seafood buffet. WOW!! From cut up lobster to prime rib its amazing. Be starving when you arrive! Its pricey at around $39 but its worth every penny. The World Buffet is very good as well and there are numerous coupons for it. The All American Bar and Grille is ok, nothing great, a bit pricey I feel for what we got. Then there is Cafe Martoranos? .....Very pricey Italian food, but good. The meatballs are to die for!! And the veal was very well prepared!!  But my favorite restaurant is the Voodoo Steakhouse. Located 50 floors up with fantastic views, its over the top outstanding. The bayou seafood platter appetizer is awesome. The scallops, the Tomahawk Ribeye, the dry aged NY...Its all well prepared but can be very pricey . Plan on $100-120 PP minimum with wine. After dinner at the steakhouse head up the staircase to dance the night away at Rio's Voodoo Rooftop Nightclub. The views are amazing. You can sneak up there for sunset as well and its well worth it. If you want to save money on drinks buy a witch doctor! They cost about $30 and you drink one or two of those and your night is set!! There are plenty of VIP seats and this place is generally fairly lax on the seating issues. This is not a Vegas hot club at this time, but it will get crowded!  If your early enough you can find places inside to set down without bottle service, which is an exception for most of the popular nightlife spots. The Rio's sportsbook is just average, while the casino floor is usually energetic! I enjoy most the dealers and staff at the Rio! Very friendly , nice, and fun!! Also to get to Vegas strip you can drive,take a cab, walk (17-18 minutes) or take the free shuttle which comes about every 30 minutes .""On to the rooms. They are large and always clean. If you can grab one of Rio's deals on the suites. Do it!!! The Masquerade Suites are HUGE! Over 1600 sq ft and I have stayed in them for as low as $119. Currently booking them for $125 on Harrahs website for April!! There is really not a whole lot of difference between the Deluxe Rooms or the Premium ones. Beds are fine, bathrooms ok. These Rooms could use some updating. The Pool is great and was very entertaining when the Saphire ladies used to work there!!! I think after a police sting or two, they are back at the club!!

I paid around $26 dollars a night including taxes and resort fees (I do get hotel discounts through my employer.) I arrived at the hotel around noon, check in isn't until four so I opted to pay for early check in for $20... Well worth it to settle in and be able to enjoy the multiple swimming pools. As I was checking in the lady at the front desk told me that my room included $9 per person, per day to use at Starbucks. For me, that was a unbelievable perk! 
My room was very large, it was a basic suite, had everything that one would need including a fully stocked minibar. Room service could have done a better job getting it prepared for us, but it was clean and comfortable. The actual resort is unbelievable, there are three swimming pools one that is designed to look like the beach complete with a sand bottom, and multiple hot tubs... Plenty of shade and you can watch people zip line over head. The pool wasn't too busy, midweek in September, but the people we met were very friendly. I didn't eat at the restaurants, I opted to have dinner on the strip which is easily accessible via a free shuttle that runs every thirty minutes until one a.m. However the hotel offered many selections and had a very reasonably priced gift shop that sold sandwiches to take on the go.

It USED to be my favorite hotel. Last summer I saw a major decline and this summer it is horrible. The pools were absolutely filthy. Grime on the tiles that hasnt been scrubbed, plastic cups and straws floating at the opening of thee pool at 9am. Grease, and scum floating atop the water at opening. There is no excuse that pools are not clean at 9am. The foul odor of cat urine surrounding the pool was horrid come to find out from employees that the hotel feeds and encourages stray cats to visit. Do something useful for the cats and have a rescue society come get them dont allow the pool to reak of urine. Pool chairs are few and far between come to learn that new chairs were promised but the proper tools to assemble were not purchased and the assembly job was left to the young life guards for completion.
Jack in guest services could not have been any more rude when asked to help understand something om my checkout receipt. And how dare him specifically mention to me how much I chose to spend in food and beverage.
My room was clean however both sinks quickly fill up and slow to drain seems to be common in the masquarade tower have had this issue on other visits, toilet seat not securely bolted and tub stopper broken so the option of soaking in a relaxing bath were quickly shot out the door.
On a good note my pool server Arlee was over the top wonderful.

The Rio has some badass cheap promo deals for rooms during the weekdays. I got prices as low as $30\/day. The room that I got was the ""Classic King"" and holy damn that was the best room I've ever had in my hotel history. The room was large and all the accommodations were great. Now there are some points from other people here that have made reviews on the Rio that I will agree with and others I don't agree with.

Now for those that say that the service at Registration is lousy, I have to agree. I was lucky that when I checked in, there was no long line at Registration. However the woman that checked me in gave me horrible directions as to get to my room. My room was on the Masquerade Tower. I've been to the Rio before in the past but this was my first time staying there. Now unfortunate for me, I was carrying my luggage and I didn't think to ask the bell hop to bring a cart for me. So I was going around the casino trying to find the Masquerade Tower. I went back to main desk and asked a man at  next to Registration (I forget which station it was). I was already in a sour mood, and the guy gave me directions but with a bit of an attitude - not apologizing for his co-worker's lack of proper directions and didn't offer me any  help with my luggage. In short the man was a complete ass. 

Now I saw reviews of people saying that they were never informed of the hotel surcharge for the internet and gym. When I booked my room online (https:\/\/www.caesars.com\/rio-las-vegas#), I was informed of the surcharge there and when I checked in on 4\/6, the woman immediately asked me if I was aware of the surcharge. So right off the bat, I have to disagree with the users that are saying that they were not informed of the surcharge. 

Another issue I had is that on Thursday, a lot of people started to check in and there was a long line. I needed to go to Registration to get my rewards points for checking in but couldn't due to the long line and there was only about 2 or 3 staff members working at Registration. Friday I had to check out and there were still about 2 or 3 staff members and a lot of people checking in. I called the front desk several times and waited for a while just so I could ask for a bell hop to come get my luggage. Needless to say, no one picked up the phone. So I basically said screw it and took my luggage out (took 2 trips) to my car by myself. 

Apart from all these issues my stay at the Rio was awesome. The room was great and for the price that I got, it was a hella good steal. Also I've heard people complain that the Rio isn't on The Strip. I actually like it like that. The Strip is always traffic and being away from that is always good. If you need to get to The Strip, its an extremely short drive to it, just head down Flamingo 

Oh yeah and I got to see Penn and Teller's show and meet them in person!


PROS:

- Great room! Big room with big bed.
- Fridge in room.
- As cheap as $30\/night.
- A\/C works! And it cools the room fairly quickly!
- Shower has nice shower head with different spray modes.
- Warm water works immediately.
- Wi-Fi (is part of the $100 resort package).
- Big flat panel TV.
- Friendly house keeping staff .
- Penn and Teller!!
- Great parking at the Masquerade Parking Structure 
- Amazing food at the World Buffet 
- Burger King and Wetzel's Pretzels inside the Rio if you don't feel going to expensive restaurants
- Not on The Strip


CONS:

- Staff at Front Desk need better training at giving directions and need better manners and etiquette!
- Have at least 10 staff members working at Front Desk especially when there's a long line!


Other than these issues, the Rio is a great place. I personally recommend this place to anyone that is going to Vegas.",5,0,0

Nevertheless, I had a generally pleasant, hassle-free stay here - and for me, that's what's most important on a vacation.  

Pros:  
The front desk has separate lines for check-in and check-out.
The awesome floor-to-ceiling view from the hotel room.
Two sinks (one located in the bathroom, and the other located right outside the bathroom).

Professional, customer-service oriented staff, not just at the front desk but also at the logo gift shop.

Not sure why the t.v. is placed on the side wall, kind of difficult to watch in bed even have to do the head crank when seated on the couch, opposite the bed. 

The bathroom was fairly clean. I don't understand why hotels especially of such caliber don't wash their shower curtains. Upon inspection, I opened the curtain an almost hurled because of the sour smell the curtain spewed. It was nice to see that they automatically provided those little things you tend to forget, such as toothbrush, toothpaste and shower stuff. The vanity area is a bit odd, nice that there is a single cup coffee maker, but why put it on a shelf and one has to pull out and place on the vanity counter. Couldn't they just raise the shelf above to give the coffee maker enough room to open for water and the coffee packs? I was tempted. 

The casino itself is like any other, noisy and people everywhere. The downside is the HVAC. It must be the original unit since every time I walked out of the casino, I smelled of stale cigarettes.

Rio is a hip spot.  They've re imaged it several times since it was open, sticking with the Carnival theme.  The Cocktail Waitress costumes changed several times also but usually centers around a set of tits in a thongish leotard.  Gotta love Vegas.
The place is very busy but big enough that its easy to find the entertainment you're looking for.

My boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 days back in March of 2014 for pretty much free since he had racked up $400 worth of points to use for Las Vegas from one of his credit cards. One of those really nice perks. He was able to get this great package deal from a Christmas\/Holiday Special Vegas was running back in late 2013. When he called back in February to check on the hotel to see if everything was still good, I believe it was stated to him that the deal could only be used in the month of February. He explained to customer service that he was never told that and booked the room for March. When we arrived to check in, we were told we were upgraded to I believe the Master Queen Suite after realizing there was a mistake on their end and which is how we got the free room upgrade, free internet and $35 room service voucher. GREAT perks! We would have been upgraded to the King Suite but they were all booked. The room had double beds and was huge! We had so much space to lay out our belongings. 

The place was very clean. The room had a TV, area for lounging, a huge vanity mirror, two sinks, spacious bathroom with a tub\/shower and granite counter space. Also, there was a large closet, more than enough drawers, small fridge, Keurig and a safe. Everything you need for a hotel stay. We had a FANTASTIC view of The Strip. We could see all of Vegas. Our room was high up and located on the side of the highway. The view itself sold me. At night, it was a site to see.

We ordered from room service which was very expensive. We shared some fries and chicken strips and had two drinks. It was over $30. Again, because we had so many points stocked up, it was essentially free. Also, we used the $35 room service voucher we were given as an upgrade. When we needed towels, we called down and they were sent up immediately. It was unfortunate we couldn't utilize the pool more but it was OK. The Casino was paying off very well. in total, my BF and I won $1500 our time there. 

Also, they have the Voodoo Lounge on the rooftop. WOW! The view is breathtaking. I was however bothered by the fact that if you wanted to sit on lounge chairs\/couches that were by the window, you had to buy a bottle of wine. I think that is was crappy. You already had to pay to get into the club and then you're told if you want to enjoy the view of indoor seating, you had to pay an additional charge. That was crappy but at least the drinks were decent. 

Where there was room for improvement was the carpet. It's old and outdated. Also, the toilets are VERY loud when they flush. I am not sure if this is due to piping or what but it was noisy.

The rooms are big, the staff was welcoming (BIG thanks for letting us check in early!) and I loved the party atmosphere.  Though the Rio is off the strip, they have shuttles that run back and forth from 10 AM - 1 AM.  

So why only 2 stars?

 Well, for starters, when we arrived, we were told that since we had pre-paid for our room, they were going to put an $800 hold on our card. We were floored that there would be such a huge hold on the card and asked the receptionist again. Yep, $800 hold!  Yikes! Luckily, we were able to use another card while we were there, but this could have put a huge damper on our trip, for sure. The weird thing was that when we checked out, we were told there was only a $100 hold on the card. We've contacted our bank and are still unsure of the actual amount held.

Aside from this, much like some of the other reviewers noted, the housekeeping was lacking. The room itself was pretty clean, but the hallways were just gross. They would leave food sitting outside of the rooms for an entire day. There were also dirty band-aids and floss littered about the hall. The outside area of the hotel where the shuttles pick you up smells like a dumpster as well.

I hope the Rio reads some of these reviews and fixes  these issues. This was my very first time in Vegas and I ended up wishing I had chosen another hotel for my inaugural trip. The staff was so friendly at the Rio and I really wanted to give them a higher rating. I will be watching these reviews to see if they improve.",2,0,0

They had a nice assortment of hot and cold sandwiches, wraps, and such as well as California rolls, salads and chicken fingers. I had a $9 hot dog and my boyfriend had a $10  chicken burger  ($9 + $1 for cheese).  We made it a meal for $5 (add seasoned fries and a fountain drink).  The food was hot and fresh; I saw the lady grill our food to order.  Boyfriend thought that the cranberry-wheat roll they served his ""Chicken Burger"" on kind of threw it off.  Had I read the menu carefully I would have asked for a plain hamburger bun.

The only downside was that they didn't have any sweetener (sugar or sugar substitute) for their unsweetened iced tea, but the Chef tournant offered to fetch some from the casino if I really needed it... I said it was ""ok"" and just added some lemonade. No problemo.

OH, it was absurdly breezy today, too.  I was trying to carry a tray with 2 plates that were too big for the tray and a drink.  I lost a couple of ketchup packets and almost had my whole meal blown onto me but made it back to the pool A-OK.

I also ordered a 32-oz Miami Vice (half strawberry daiquiri, half pina colada, both ready mixed and poured from an adult slurpee machine).  I was a little confused because when I read the menu last week it said $12 for  16-oz and $16 for 32-oz but the bartender charged me $24. Oh well, I just left a smaller tip... not like he actually had to blend the things from scratch.



POOLS:
There were 3 pools open both times we visited (a fourth pool near the back was roped off both times).  Our daughter's favorite pool is the sand pool... she actually just likes the sand part.  Around 4 PM the sun hides behind the hotel and the sand bar gets shady and cool real quick.  This pool gets 3-stars.

We decided to move further back and check out the other 2 pools.  I tried taking her to the one in the dead center of the pool area but decided to get out when I saw a couple having sex near the lifeguard station. YUCK. This one gets a negative 1 star.

So we went to the 3rd pool which has a waterfall feature that was turned off (I'm guessing) due to the huge gusts of wind.  That was alright except for the A-holes that decided to play catch and take over the majority of the pool.  I'd give this pool a 2 star.

Bottom Line:
We'll probably be back again...most likely to play in the sand.  The pool food was actually pretty good and the prices were reasonable compared to other Vegas pools.  The Miami Vice was fun the first time I came.  The vodka red bulls were WEAK.  We may not go into the 2nd pool ever again. 3rd pool...maybe.  Depends on what time we get there and how dark we want to get.  They don't really check for room keys, but they will check you for outside food and drink.",1,0,0

The only issue with having a room so high (the view was AMAZING) is that the elevators can take so long (seriously it takes forever). On check out the elevators had actually broken down so we had to walk down about 20 floors before we could get another elevator. 

The staff were really friendly but not invasive. The rooms are huge, good size closet and great vanity area. I liked that they provided a Kurig coffee machine and a refrigerator too so we weren't dependent coffee shops and could keep our own snacks. The rooms are pretty old though so don't expect the same standard you get in some of the other Vegas hotels (you get what you pay for)
The only thing that bothered me was the $14 a day wifi charge(per device), which is frustrating when you have two computers and two smart phones as it adds up. The location is off the strip but they do provide a complimentary shuttle bus to Caesars, and you can always get a taxi. 
Walking through the casino they had a lot of different mini shows going on, some waitresses would sing, bartenders would flare etc.

Our suite on the 15th floor of the Masquerade Tower was large and spacious, with a comfy king-size bed and large couch, and there was plenty of room for us to toss our stuff everywhere. The bathroom was a bit cramped, but the presence of a second sink outside the bathroom and a makeup station complete with mirror and chair made up for it. While the furnishings weren't quite as extravagant as I expected for a suite in Vegas (the light on the makeup mirror didn't work, the couch upholstery seemed like it was at least 30 years old), for the price it was great. The free shuttle service every 30 min to the Strip was also a great touch.

If not for the water incident and a couple other minor annoyances described below, I would have given the Rio a solid 4 stars.

Minor annoyances:
1) There was no wastebin in the huge bedroom area, but there were 2 in the bathroom. Housekeeping negligence or lack of oversight by hotel management?
2) There was no coffee maker even though there were instant coffee packets lying on the table. I couldn't heat water to make a late-night ramen snack. Again, staff negligence?
3) There was an additional resort fee of $33\/night tacked onto the original rate of $45\/night, which I was totally unaware of. I booked the Rio through Explore Cruise and Travel, which made no mention of a resort fee. I first found out about the resort fee when I was forced to pay it in order to check out. After doing some research, I found that resort fees are common to Vegas hotels, but finding out that our fee almost doubled AS WE WERE LEAVING left a sour taste in my mouth.

Water incident:
This topped off our stay. I still can't believe that something like this could happen in a modern city, especially one as lavish as Las Vegas. My girlfriend and I came back at 2:00am from a night of drinking, exhausted and hoping to catch a quick shower, chug fluids to avoid a hangover, and sleep. When we went to the bathroom, we found that THERE WAS NO WATER. No water as in, no water came out of the sink or tub when I turned the knob, just a pained choking noise from my throat. We called the front desk and found that there was an 'emergency water outage.' From the curtness of the concierge's reply, it seemed like he had been fielding calls like this for a while. There was no explanation given, just a notice that the estimated repair time would be 2 hours. My girlfriend and I were stunned. We used what little drinking water we had to brush our teeth and went to bed dirty. The water was back when I used the bathroom at 6am. However, it was too late to save my hangover, which intensified greatly from the lack of water and left me feeling like a zombie until mid-afternoon.

All-suite hotel
Friendly staff
Shuttle buses to Paris and Bally's

CONS:

Located off the strip
Older clientele (think middle-aged and up)
Parking garage too damn far (or maybe I'm being a lazyass but I remember walking a lot)
Poor housecleaning (there were 3 used bandaids from the previous guest(s) the first time I stayed here. Two in one of the queen sized beds, and one on the floor, AND a beer bottle in the hallway)

I'd pick Rio over Luxor and Excalibur though. It's not too bad, but the used bandaids were kinda gross, even though I wasn't the one who slept in THAT bed ;)",0,1,0

We must have stayed in the renovated towers as our suite was nicely decorated and very comfortable. We had a mini bar and fridge.a nice view and the staff were all pretty helpful and friendly. I went to the pool, not the topless one, but the main one (Ipanema Beach) and it was not that crowded, they have a few pools to choose from as well as, jacuzzi's..the bar is ok at the pool, no happy hour and drinks are expensive $26 for two so-so mojitos. I know, I know bartenders looove making those, but shoot, your getting a tip..Anyways, go gamble and get free drinks instead.
I give this place four stars because it was a good stay, not complaints about the hotel AND, my honey bear won $1000 dollars within 20-minutes of us getting there....that would make any stay pleasurable!!",2,2,2

Love the pool here.",0,0,0
